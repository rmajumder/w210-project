  "<p>If there was a high point in the reputation and significance of fact checkers, wonks and poll crunchers it came during the 2012 US presidential campaign. It was the election where former president Bill Clinton held court at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Miami for just under an hour. </p> <p>Such was the avalanche of statistics that night that fact check site Politifact called it \u201c<a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2012/09/our-clinton-nightmare/\">Our Clinton Nightmare</a>\u201d, bemoaning the \u201ceffort required to run down his many statistics and factual claims, producing little for us to write about\u201d.<br></p> <p>The numbers just rolled off Clinton\u2019s tongue \u2013 4.5 million private sector jobs, 500,000 manufacturing jobs, 250,000 more people working in the auto industry, 3 million young people between 19 and 25 insured for the first time, health care costs rising at under 4%. \u201cLook,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/05/us/politics/transcript-of-bill-clintons-speech-to-the-democratic-national-convention.html?_r=0\">he said to the faithful</a>, \u201chere\u2019s what really happened.

It was the election in which Barack Obama cited fact checkers in the <a href=\"http://debates.org/index.php?page=october-22-2012-the-third-obama-romney-presidential-debate\">third presidential debate</a> to counter Mitt Romney\u2019s assertion that Obama had gone on an \u201capology tour\u201d.</p> <p>It was also the election in which the poll aggregators such as Nate Silver had put down their glasses by the time of that third debate, and called the race for Obama. It was the election where insiders such as the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Peggy Noonan came to grief, believing their finger on the pulse was <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/peggynoonan/2012/11/05/monday-morning/\">more accurate than the polls</a>.</p> <p>It was a total victory for the wonks, the fact checkers, the poll crunchers.</p> <p>Four years later we have Donald Trump winning the Republican Party nomination with a record number of fact-checked lies, the British voting to leave the EU despite all advice to the contrary, the local ABC\u2019s own fact-checking unit being axed and Nate Silver\u2019s <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/hey-at-least-the-cavs-might-not-get-swept/\">538 statistical site</a> even getting the result of the NBA final series wrong.</p> <p>What the hell? With this seeming failure has come no small amount of glee from progressives. While poll analysts and fact checkers are not the same, they do work on the same side of the street, and are the cause of much angst among progressives, which would seem odd given progressives as a rule generally perform better on fact checks.</p> <p>After the recent Australian federal election, Fairfax\u2019s Matthew Knott reviewed the media\u2019s coverage, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2016-opinion/election-2016-the-uncomfortable-truth-is-the-media-got-it-wrong-how-did-we-do-it-20160705-gpzatm\">in which he admitted</a>, \u201cThose political reporters not too hubristic to engage in self doubt are asking: did we get it wrong? Did we, as a collective, miss the story?\u201d</p> <p>The story that was seemingly missed was not a policy or a hidden funding cut, but the margin of victory by the LNP. But really, who gives a damn? If you think the prime role of your job as a journalist covering an election is to predict the results, then there is a lot more wrong than just whether or not your prediction was faulty.</p> <p>But the devotion to polling and prediction is also a concern for progressives because inherently polls \u2013 and thus their analysis \u2013 reinforce the status quo. As US political scientist Benjamin Ginsberg has noted, the growth of public polling has been \u201cmost damaging to the political fortunes of the groups that represented the interest and aspirations of the working classes\u201d.</p> <p>Without polling, politicians can only gauge voters\u2019 moods on certain issues either through meetings with constituents, letters or through observing political actions such as protests, strikes or rallies. Polls can give equal weight to the attitudes of the uninterested and the politically active.</p> <p>For the progressive wonks the worry is not so much about advocating policies or programs that are detrimental to society, but whether the need for data and evidence means your arguments are being ignored by those who matter (itself an issue for debate) and that secondly you are pushing the debate towards the centre \u2013 and also being part of the movement that then pushes that centre ever more to the right.</p> <p>Among the most common strawman arguments is that the Brexit vote and Trump\u2019s ascendancy prove that relying on fact-checking and wonks is doomed to failure. And there may be truth in that, but I\u2019ve yet to hear anyone suggest that facts should be the only weapon used in a debate. No election \u2013 not even the fact-checking triumph of 2012 \u2013 has ever been won on the basis of who told the fewest lies. Similarly no policy debate has ever been won just because a group of experts did a review and someone tweeted a graph.</p> <p>If you are arguing that there needs to be action on climate change, yes you\u2019re going to need more than a graph to do it. But you\u2019re also going to struggle without one. A concept as divorced from most people\u2019s lives as is climate change needs at the very least to be fought with data \u2013 especially when the opposing side is doing its best to suggest their data shows there is no need to worry. Among the most influential examples was the ultra-wonky documentary An Inconvenient Truth. Did the film win the debate? Did its numerous graphs on climate change lead to global action that saw a price on carbon? Well no, but that\u2019s not to say nothing was gained \u2013 more perhaps that progressives have a tendency to discredit their victories. Australia did implement a price on carbon.</p> <p>Now perhaps the reason the ALP subsequently lost the 2013 election was because there was too much of an emphasis on data and economic neoliberalism and not enough talk of values. Or perhaps the main reason we no longer have a price on carbon is because the ALP lost the election after three years fanning a dumpster-fire of internal division.</p> <p>Who can say. But the wonk critics do also have a point. Despite what the authors of books such as Freakonomics might attest, economics neither explains everything in life nor persuades. Fact-checking is particularly useless at countering prejudice. A graph on the improvement of GDP from immigration is unlikely to switch the votes of people from Trump or One Nation hostile to the very idea of foreigners.</p> <p>While there may be some objective centrists, I would argue in Australia the progressive wonks \u2013 and I put myself in this camp \u2013 write as much with passion for a cause as they do with passion for facts. When I write an article to dismiss the claims regarding the numbers of welfare recipients, I don\u2019t do it from some neutral point of view. I do it because people are lying in order to hurt the most disadvantaged in society. I\u2019m not going to ignore the lie\u2014and using facts to counter it is not I would argue some anodyne approach.</p> <p>The adherence to data can easily lead the wonks to prefer the safety of the status quo. This was something I was conscious of when arguing against the Abbott plan for extending paid parental leave to full replacement-wage level for 26 weeks. I argued that such a plan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/mar/10/abbotts-paid-parental-leave-will-do-little-to-bring-women-to-the-workforce\">would do little to increase women\u2019s workforce participation</a> (the aim of the policy), and that the money would be better spent on child care. I could see the moral argument that paid parental leave should be paid regardless of the parents\u2019 income, but I could also see the moral argument that governments should aim to improve the standard of living for women with children. For me the better policy response was in broader childcare policy rather than an expanded PPL. </p> <p>But the risk \u2013 as soon as you suggest factors such as the size of a budget deficit should be considered \u2013 is that such an approach will always see you favouring a more centrist position. Consider for example the common argument about government spending and the size of the budget. During the last election campaign Anthony Albanese argued that \u201cspending is higher as a proportion of GDP today than it was under the global financial crisis\u201d. The ABC\u2019s fact-checking unit <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-31/fact-check-is-government-spending-today-higher-than-gfc/7459392\">found that statement to be incorrect</a> because in one year during the GFC government spending was marginally higher.</p> <p>This set off quite a debate \u2013 especially online involving economist Stephen Koukoulas, who argued the ABC fact checkers had taken far too narrow a view of what constituted the GFC period. And yet to what end was the fight? Do progressives really care that the ALP spent less than an LNP government? Doesn\u2019t that merely reinforce the conservative position that smaller government is better?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/08/close-call-how-the-pollsters-got-the-election-result-right\">Close call: how the pollsters got the election result right | Peter Lewis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Progressives love to blame themselves. Rare is an election defeat by the ALP that does not result in great internal angst, gnashing of teeth and writing of books charting what went right and what needs to be done. Such self-reflection certainly is preferable to the view that it is always the other side or the media which that is at fault \u2013 or even worse, that voters are to blame. But the anti-wonk fight is a futile one. Progressives should not give up on the facts, if only because doing so cedes the space to the conservative forces.<br></p> <p>The wonks themselves need, however, to watch whether their work is merely perpetuating a status quo due to a fear of the bold, or a disinclination to countenance an upset, or because the lines within which they fight have been laid out by the conservative side. </p> <p>But mostly they need to be wary that their adherence to the data can see them lose sight of the greater truth: that despite what some might have thought in 2012, facts \u2013 whether they be on GDP, climate temperatures or any other data \u2013 are not the only truth in life, or politics.</p> <p><strong>This is an edited extract of an essay that appears in the <a href=\"https://www.mup.com.au/items/190003\">spring issue of Meanjin</a>, out 15 September.

  "<p>The Dallas Cowboys were left for dead when Tony Romo went down in the preseason. They already had so many holes, especially on their defense, that the thought of giving the team to a rookie quarterback seemed disastrous. How would Dallas survive with Dak Prescott as their leader?</p> <p>Perhaps they won\u2019t. Maybe over the months without Romo, Prescott\u2019s inexperience will be exposed. But for one important week against his team\u2019s biggest rival, in their stadium, he looked every bit as capable of handling himself. On Sunday, he mowed through Washington in a way many of his predecessors have not.</p> <p>By throwing for 292 yards in the Cowboys 27-23 victory at FedEx Field, Prescott showed he can lead Dallas to a big victory. He was not spectacular in the win. The Cowboys coaches are not pushing him to be great. They don\u2019t ask him to throw too deep or do anything too complicated, but he doesn\u2019t have to do huge things. Not with a receiver like Dez Bryant and a running back like Ezekiel Elliott. Sometimes all he has to do is be good enough. He can let the others make the big plays.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/18/nfl-round-up-new-england-patriots-jimmy-garoppolo-week-two\">NFL wrap: wild finishes as Garoppolo torches Miami before leaving hurt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As gifted as Romo is as both a passer and offensive mind, he sometimes tries to do too much. His biggest failures have come on forced passes that never needed to be made. Prescott, as a rookie shoved into a role he wasn\u2019t supposed to fill so early in his career, played smart on Sunday. He was given a lot of safe rollouts and play-action passes that would be considered safe, But he completed them. And he did something very impressive for any Dallas quarterback going into Washington in leading the team on three scoring drives that went for more than three-quarters of the field.</p> <p>In winning this game he also pushed Washington \u2013 a preseason favorite to win the division \u2013 to 0-2 in the NFC East, with both of those losses at home. His counterpart, Kirk Cousins, could have taken a big step toward the huge long-term contract for which he has been asking. Instead, he looked uncomfortable all day, was off-target a lot and was intercepted in the end zone when Washington could have taken control of the game.</p> <p>Dak Prescott wasn\u2019t fantastic on Sunday but he was good enough.

But a population growth of 40,000 residents a year has led to a build-up in state bureaucracy and given rise to fears of urban gentrification.</p> <p>Asked by pollsters which issues had most influenced their votes, <a href=\"http://wahl.tagesschau.de/wahlen/2016-09-18-LT-DE-BE/index.shtml\">Berliners in the west and the east</a> listed social justice, the local economy and the state of the education system above the management of the refugee crisis.</p> <p>The month of campaigning in the German capital was dominated by rising rental prices and the ongoing fiasco of the new Berlin Brandenburg airport rather than refugees or fear of terror attacks.</p> <p>Unlike most capitals in Europe, Berlin has higher public debts than other big cities such as Munich or Hamburg and continues to be subsidised by richer states around Germany.</p> <p>M\u00fcller took over from Berlin\u2019s long-term mayor Klaus Wowereit two years ago, after previously serving as party leader and senator. A more managerial figure than the often exuberant, openly gay Wowereit, M\u00fcller initially enjoyed high popularity ratings.</p> <p>Yet, after 15 years of Social Democrat rule, Sunday\u2019s result is a sobering step down from the 30.8% the party enjoyed at the height of the Wowereit era \u2013 and the 61.9% achieved under late mayor and ex-chancellor Willy Brandt. Like the CDU, the Social Democrats gained their lowest share of the vote in Berlin ever. In the history of modern Germany, no party has previously won an election with a similarly poor result.</p> <p>The Pirate party, a band of internet freedom activists who managed to enter parliament in 2011, dropped below the 5% threshold.<br></p> <p>But the result will hurt Merkel\u2019s CDU most. After defeats for the Christian Democrats in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Rhineland-Westphalia and Baden\u2013W\u00fcrttemberg, the Berlin result is the fourth blow in a row for the centre-right party, which came close to gaining an absolute majority at federal level only three years ago.</p> <p>For the party leadership, it has become hard to ignore a pattern behind the results. In all four elections, established parties shed votes while the upstart AfD, founded in 2013, managed to achieve double digits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da2f7aa1435e20916def8abdf2d103aff4e684d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da2f7aa1435e20916def8abdf2d103aff4e684d3/0_134_4239_2544/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The CDU\u2019s mayoral candidate Frank Henkel casts his vote.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The CDU\u2019s mayoral candidate Frank Henkel casts his vote.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jorg Carstensen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As in the three previous votes, the CDU\u2019s mayoral candidate in Berlin, Frank Henkel, got punished even though the party tried to distance themselves from their own chancellor\u2019s stance over the refugee issue.

Authorities in St Cloud noted that they did not yet have evidence about the attacker\u2019s motives. Isis has claimed other attacks by people without links to the group.</p> <p>Police have not named the suspect, but Ahmed Adan, a Somali American, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that the attacker was his son, 22-year-old Dahir Adan. The elder Adan said that his son was born in Africa and had lived in the US for 15 years, and that police told him at about 9pm local time that his son had died at the mall.</p> <p>St Cloud police chief William Blair Anderson said police had had three contacts with the man who attacked the mall, though all were over minor traffic infractions. Police and the FBI had impounded the man\u2019s car, he said, and executed a search warrant for his residence. </p> <p>The suspect wore \u201ca private security uniform\u201d during his attack, the chief said, though it was not clear whether he was ever an employee of such a firm.</p> <p>The attacker was stopped after a harrowing confrontation with Falconer that was caught on Macy\u2019s surveillance footage and described by the mayor. The suspect entered the mall carrying a knife and began stabbing people, Kleis said. Falconer quickly confronted him. </p> <p>\u201cFrom what witnesses say, he identified himself as a police officer,\u201d Kleis said. </p> <p>Falconer asked the man to back down. \u201cYou actually see him going down by command and then immediately lunging toward the officer,\u201d the mayor said, \u201cwhat may have been 20ft or beyond, covered in less than two seconds with a knife.\u201d</p> <p>Falconer fired, and the man fell. He rose and lunged again. \u201cYou see him fall and get back up,\u201d Kleis said, \u201cthree times, and then even after that to the point where he\u2019s still attempting to get back up again when the officer made a fatal blow.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then you see our officers, St Cloud PD, entering the scene at that moment.\u201d</p> <p>About five minutes passed between the first 911 call and the moment \u201cthe subject was eliminated\u201d, Anderson said, praising Falconer, whom Kleis said was \u201cclearly a hero\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis could have been a lot worse but for the swift response,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cOfficer Falconer\u2019s actions, again, were swift and direct and in my opinion appropriate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no imminent threat,\u201d he added, of the aftermath of the attack. \u201cRight now there\u2019s nothing that we have gleaned that would suggest to us that it is anything other than what it appears to be now.\u201d<br></p> <p>Kleis said: \u201cWhat happened last night is what keeps me up at night.\u201d Praising his town and the police response, he added: \u201cThis individual and this evil act, unjustifiable by any means, will not shake this community.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e8d8c0c78f7185738b81dabc349e86365c820c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e8d8c0c78f7185738b81dabc349e86365c820c3/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Crossroads Center mall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Crossroads Center mall on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jared Goyette</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Sunday, the parking lot of the mall was deserted on what would normally been a busy shopping day.

  "<p>The internet has never only been a technology. It has had cultural, social and economic meanings which have interacted with its technological achievements in unpredictable ways. When it first appeared it was entirely the creature of the American government, which funded much of the research that led to it, and provided a regulatory environment in which it could thrive and spread. The ideology of the early pioneers oscillated between a kind of pragmatic anarchism and a belief in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Postel\" title=\"\">the benevolent despotism of engineers</a>, where the final judgments would be made by those who best understood the technology.</p> <p>The web is now an essential conduit for both money and ideas. Politicians in many countries think it is far too important to be left to the engineers. The latest to get in on the act is Senator Ted Cruz, the defeated Republican presidential candidate. He has been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/09/15/ted-cruz-has-made-an-obscure-internet-agency-his-first-post-presidential-crusade/\" title=\"\">campaigning</a> energetically to maintain the US government\u2019s job of managing a group that oversees domain names on the Internet. Washington is supposed to transfer its control over the <a href=\"https://www.icann.org/\" title=\"\">Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers</a> (Icann) to the international community in two weeks. Icann&#xa0;does many things, but it\u2019s often described as a kind of web phone directory \u2013 matching a string of numbers to their domain names. This ensures that when you type \u201cwww.theguardian.com\u201d into a web browser, you end up at the Guardian\u2019s homepage.</p> <p>The openness and reliability of the internet as it presently exists depends on such mechanisms, known as the domain name system (DNS). Simplistically, one could knock a site off the internet by erasing its place in the DNS. There are ways round this, but it is undeniable that the power to block political dissidents or to stymie attempts for opponents to organise would be handy for authoritarian governments. China\u2019s great firewall already hijacks DNS requests in order to bar websites that it deems subversive. The existence of that firewall shows that Icann cannot protect all the freedoms the system makes possible, but it can make sure the formalities are observed even by those who are subverting their intent.</p> <p>What <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/16/us/politics/ted-cruz-internet-domain-names-funding.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">Senator Cruz</a> and other Republicans claim is that if the US gives up oversight of the DNS function, it could lead to dictatorships taking control of the internet and eventually censoring content throughout the world. They are sceptical that an international organisation would safeguard the open nature of today\u2019s web. However, the truth is that if the US blocks the transfer of Icann then that would be an excuse for authoritarian regimes to attempt to exert more control over the internet.</p> <p>Despite tech titans such as Google and Amazon pleading with Washington to ensure that Icann becomes a global body rather than a US one, the Republicans seemed to suggest they could bring government to a halt over the issue. They sensed a chance to wound a departing President Obama, whose administration started the shift in 2014. We have been here before: Senator Cruz was instrumental in shutting down Washington in 2013. Another shutdown would be disastrous.</p> <p>Icann is not a particularly admirable organisation in itself. But it represents a vision of global, open cooperation that is preferable to the ruthless and shortsighted jockeying for advantage represented in their different ways&#xa0;by both the Chinese government and Senator Cruz.</p>",

  "<p>There is an admirable calm in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel\" title=\"\">Angela Merkel</a> that contrasts immensely with the bluster and hysteria that has come to dominate a lot of the political discourse in Europe. So when on Saturday <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/angela-merkel-drops-the-we-can-do-it-slogan-catchphrase-migration-refugees/\" title=\"\">she distanced herself from the \u201c<em>Wir schaffen das</em>\u201d</a> (we can do it) slogan she\u2019d so often repeated about the refugee crisis, many wondered if the chancellor had lost her confidence. Merkel may not be called \u201cMutti\u201d that often any more. Yet she remains Europe\u2019s towering figure. She also appears rather lonely at the top. In fact, Germany as a whole looks lonely these days, as it deals with the monumental task of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/14/germany-unveils-integration-law-for-refugees-migrants\" title=\"\">integrating more than a million refugees</a>, whose arrival last year up-ended politics and triggered much national soul-searching.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/02/angela-merkel-marine-le-pen-europe-destiny\">Angela Merkel and Marine Le Pen: one of them will shape Europe\u2019s future | Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Don\u2019t be under any illusion that diplomacy, whether at the European summit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/bratislava-summit-donald-tusk-urges-eu-leaders-not-to-waste-brexit-crisis\" title=\"\">in Bratislava</a> or in New York, where the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/united-nations-criticism-refugee-crisis-plan-human-rights\" title=\"\">UN summit on refugees</a> opens on Monday, will offer much relief. Germany will basically need to cope on its own. If I had to bet, I\u2019d say its chances are good. This is arguably the single most important challenge Europe faces: overcoming the shock of seeing huge numbers of victims of the world\u2019s chaos turn up in cities and regions previously sheltered from external disruption. Germany stands at the heart of this test, and its neighbours are watching closely.</p> <p>There is no lack of gloomy predictions. Nor is schadenfreude entirely absent when Germany\u2019s European partners wring their hands at the refugee problem. (France\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Valls, stooped low last year when he publicly smirked at suggestions Merkel should get the Nobel peace prize for welcoming refugees.) No small amount of criticism has been levelled at Merkel from populists across the continent, as well as from within her own party and governing coalition. Much less vociferously highlighted are the reasons why Germany may just succeed.</p> <p>Of course, public mood can swerve in unpredictable directions. Amazing scenes of Germans applauding refugees as they got off trains were swiftly forgotten after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/06/cologne-sex-assault-attacks-case-collapses\" title=\"\">Cologne New Year\u2019s Eve attacks</a>. That\u2019s not to say German civil society isn\u2019t deploying impressive efforts to make sure the migration phenomenon ends on a positive note.</p> <p>On a recent study tour of \u201cGermany and the refugees story\u201d organised by the Robert Bosch Foundation, I met incredibly dedicated social workers, NGO representatives and city or regional officials in Cologne and Stuttgart. Many did speak of the difficulties they encounter, not least the bureaucratic hurdles that stand in the way of easing refugees into the labour market after they\u2019ve taken German language courses. But what struck me was how upbeat most of these interlocutors wanted to appear. Merkel may want to play down \u201c<em>Wir schaffen das</em>\u201d, but those words have nevertheless said something about the nation\u2019s state of mind. One outstanding example of can-do spirit comes from a business in Stuttgart called Lapp Group, which has taken 12 young refugees into apprenticeship programmes. Hearing these smiling young men from Syria, Afghanistan and Eritrea describe how they intend to make the most of this chance helps dispel doubts. The Lapp family, who founded this electric cable producing firm in the 1950s and still run it, are keen to take their proud share of a nationwide effort.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/14/germany-unveils-integration-law-for-refugees-migrants\">Germany unveils integration law for refugees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just as Germany reinvented itself after the war, and just as it achieved reunification, this is seen as a defining moment in the country\u2019s history. The Lapp family\u2019s role may be small in the wider picture, but it certainly makes the word \u201csolidarity\u201d sound less empty than it does in much of the rest of Europe.</p> <p>If any country can succeed in coping with a massive influx of&#xa0;refugees, surely this is it. Stuttgart\u2019s lush residential neighbourhoods and its industrial powerhouses point to Germany\u2019s thriving economy. And the prosperity and stability of Germany\u2019s institutions are key assets in the integration effort. Unemployment is at its lowest since 1990, and trade surpluses are at a record high. As Armin Laschet, deputy federal chairman of Merkel\u2019s CDU party, puts it, the question isn\u2019t so much whether Germany can afford financially to deal with the refugee equation, \u201cit\u2019s whether our society can get to grips\u201d with the new situation.</p> <p>Globalisation is widely faulted for breeding populism. But Germany has dramatically benefited from globalisation, thanks to its exports. What is at stake here has more to do&#xa0;with adapting to new forms of diversity, as the country imports population groups. This is the first ever wave of Arab immigrants to Germany, whose Muslim community had since the 1950s been essentially composed of Turkish \u201cGastarbeiter\u201d (guest workers).</p> <p>The positive side is that Germany has none of France\u2019s historical hangovers in dealing with Arab immigration. The less positive side is that it took decades for Germans to accept that Turkish workers and their families would stay and become full citizens.</p> <p>It\u2019s been said German officials have tried to paper over the magnitude of the task \u2013 including when information was scant about the Cologne attacks. But it\u2019s hard to deny that managing public perceptions is as important as setting up education, housing and work for the newly arrived. This sits at the centre of Merkel\u2019s numerous \u201ckeep calm\u201d messages. It is also at the centre of Germany\u2019s revived interest in European defence and security. Merkel is acutely aware that if terrorism rears its head again, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/26/germany-bavaria-police-attacks-munich-ansbach-wurzburg\" title=\"\">as it did this summer</a>, the nation\u2019s quest for a new sense of cohesion might quickly be shattered.</p> <p>Germany\u2019s strengths in addressing its refugee challenge can be easily overlooked. The reasons why Merkel repeated \u201c<em>Wir schaffen das</em>\u201d so often have not suddenly vanished \u2013 even if she\u2019s toned down the message. But just as Europe needs Germany to succeed in integrating refugees (otherwise populists will benefit everywhere), the&#xa0;country needs Europe to act collectively to make sure the conditions for integration aren\u2019t thwarted by violence. Loneliness is something it can\u2019t afford.</p>",

  "<p>Tottenham Hotspur nudged up to third in the Premier League with a tight, hard-fought, somehow oddly inevitable 1-0 defeat of Sunderland. Harry Kane scored the only goal but was taken off on a stretcher just before the end with a nasty twist of the ankle, a moment that may prove more significant than three points gathered against muscular but cautious opponents who had only two shots on target all game.</p> <p>David Moyes\u2019s team came to White Hart Lane to defend and did so well enough for 58 minutes until a slip from Papy Djilobodji gave the ball to Kane in front of goal. He had time to take a touch and side-foot into the corner to break a White Hart Lane <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/05/harry-kane-tottenham-england-golden-boot\" title=\"\">goal-blank stretching back to March</a>.</p> <p>Mauricio Pochettino was happy with the win after a gruelling week, less so with the injury to a player who is so vital to the rhythms of his team. \u201cIt\u2019s for this that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/13/tottenham-vincent-janssen-one-man-army-az-alkmaar\" title=\"\">we signed Vincent [Janssen]</a> who has been doing very well. He\u2019s a striker who can give us other options,\u201d Pochettino said. But the fact is Spurs have been slightly winging it when it comes to backup for their main man. Currently no other senior striker at the club has actually scored for the first&#xa0;team. Eric Dier and Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 also picked up slight knocks but both should be fit for the trip to Middlesbrough on Saturday.</p> <p>For Sunderland this was a fourth defeat in five that leaves them listing along joint\u2011bottom of the table and Moyes still looking \u2013 although not, on this evidence, with that much urgency \u2013 for his first victory.

Offering a little more adventure might be another. Not least against opponents who did seem vulnerable when Sunderland committed Adnan Januzaj and Steven Pienaar forward in support of the rather lonesome Jermain Defoe, who had a total of 13 touches all game. Sunderland might have even gone to half-time 1-0 up had Pienaar been able to beat Kyle Walker on the line \u2013 as he really should \u2013 after good work from Januzaj on the break.</p> <p>It was a rare attack from the blancmange-coloured shirts on a grey north London afternoon, with the piles of displaced earth and the huge steel armature of the new stadium now rising above the open corner at one end. Spurs were dominant from the start, pressing down the flanks but finding no way past the athletic and assertive Jordan Pickford.</p> <p>Pochettino has spoken of the need to find other gears, other ways of playing and here he changed the texture of his midfield, bringing in Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Moussa Sissoko and Victor Wanyama, with Dier dropping into the back four and Jan Vertonghen shifting to left-back. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 in particular has been missed during his ban; a midfielder with muscle as well as craft, able to pass, dribble and keep the ball.</p> <p>Spurs started with purpose, Son Heung-min \u2013 who played well throughout \u2013 flashing the ball across the face of goal after a driving run. Jason Denayer was a late inclusion in Sunderand\u2019s XI after Patrick van Aanholt withdrew for unspecified reasons. Understandably, he struggled for a while against Son on his Premier League debut. Kane drew a smart near-post block from Pickford after Son\u2019s low cross. Later Son cut inside and spanked a shot on to the foot of the post.</p> <p>Sunderland rarely pushed across halfway but they began to offer a little space after half-time as Dele Alli moved nicely across the front line. It was Alli\u2019s skip across the box that made space for Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 to play a lovely little pass to Son, whose shot billowed the side netting. And moments later Sunderland finally blinked. Walker swung a high cross in from the right, Alli nodded down and Djilobodji made a horrible attempt to control on his chest, deflecting the ball to Kane.</p> <p>With the game drifting away Moyes abandoned the deep-lying trench defence, with Duncan Watmore providing some gambolling menace down the right. Januzaj was sent off for a second yellow in the 89th minute. Spurs might have scored again, but could not find the final pass. Janssen\u2019s wild blast over the bar in stoppage time was fitting end to a slightly fretful match.</p>",

As Sunderland\u2019s seventh manager in five turbulent years he knows all about the club\u2019s reputation as a sort of Bermuda Triangle for his profession but the Scot remains determined to put things right on Wearside.</p> <p>Doing so will involve solving an enduring puzzle. Predecessor after predecessor has made oblique references to \u201csomething being wrong\u201d at the club. Gus Poyet was particularly vocal on the subject. After avoiding relegation last spring Sam Allardyce described <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland\">Sunderland</a> as his \u201cmost difficult\u201d managerial posting, with off-field issues proving especially vexing.</p> <p>So is something really wrong at the club? \u201cStrangely it\u2019s been mentioned,\u201d said Moyes as he prepared for Sunday\u2019s visit to Tottenham Hotspur still seeking his first Premier League win <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/23/david-moyes-appointed-sunderland-sam-allardyce\">since taking charge in July</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere is, there\u2019s something \u2013 but I\u2019m no closer to identifying it. The biggest thing I\u2019m focusing on is trying to get the team right. Of course I can see other things which need to be improved or altered but I want to up the team\u2019s levels. We need a win to get ourselves started.\u201d</p> <p>It is shortly after 9am on Friday and, although the thunder and lightning that woke the north-east in the early hours have abated, the sky remains ominously black as rain cascades down. Such weather pretty much matched Moyes\u2019s mood on Monday night, when his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/12/sunderland-everton-premier-league-match-report\">side surrendered 3-0 at home</a> to his former club Everton. It seemed to serve as confirmation that, as predicted, Sunderland were set for a fifth successive relegation dalliance. \u201cI almost always sleep well,\u201d says the former Manchester United and Real Sociedad manager. \u201cBut Monday was a bad night.\u201d ...</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/17/wearside-david-moyes-sunderland-premier-league\">Read the full story here.</a></p> </div>   </div>",

Understandable, perhaps, that he is forcing things a little, still getting used to having that bit more time on the ball, more options around him. But for those moments of frustration there remain touches of genius. Young will soon have a decision to make with Gopperth continuing to impress as a makeshift No12. \u201cThe issue we have is that we\u2019ve only got two No10s,\u201d added Young. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a risk for the both of them to be playing every game. When it comes to Europe we\u2019re going to have to give one of them a rest and let the other take control. It\u2019s very hard to decide between them but I don\u2019t have to at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>Five minutes before half-time you could not help but feel for Bristol. Off went Guy Thompson, barnstorming for half an hour, and on came Nathan Hughes. Wasps had already wrapped up the bonus point with their fourth try from Matt Symons by then and Wade added number five before the break. Their first try was ominous, both for the ease with which Tommy Taylor was shoved over and because there was just over a minute on the clock. The procession did not materialise straight away but Bristol could do worryingly little with their possession other than notch a Tusi Pisi penalty. Daly scored Wasps\u2019 second on 22 minutes when Cipriani\u2019s diagonal kick struck the corner flag and stayed in, before Jake Cooper-Woolley and Symons plunged over from close range. Wade registered his first after a scything break from deep by Daly for a 37-3 lead at the break.</p> <p>If complacency set in for Wasps, and Frank Halai\u2019s woeful kick up the middle that led to Jack Lam\u2019s pushover try for Bristol suggested it had, Wade\u2019s mesmeric footwork \u2013 making a fool of Jordan Williams \u2013 stamped it out pretty quickly. Ashley Johnson\u2019s first score was a well-worked driving maul before Cipriani exchanged passes with Halai, pinned back his ears, dashed down the right and splashed over.</p> <p>Mitch Eadie then scored from close range for Bristol, Johnson added his second and Gaston Cortes grabbed a third for the visitors whose valiant pursuit of a bonus point ended in vain \u2013 Daly having the final say with try No10 for the hosts.</p> <p><strong>Wasps</strong> Miller (Eastmond, 49); Wade (Bassett, 56), Daly, Gopperth, Halai; Cipriani, Simpson (Hampson, 56); McIntyre (Mullan, 50), Taylor (Johnson, 41), Cooper-Woolley (Swainston, 56), Symons (Myall, 49), Gaskell (capt), Rieder, Young, Thompson (Hughes, 36).</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Taylor, Daly 2, Cooper-Woolley, Symons, Wade 2, Johnson 2, Cipriani <strong>Cons</strong> Gopperth 7 <strong>Pens</strong> Gopperth 2</p> <p><strong>Bristol</strong> Williams; Edwards, Hurrell (Mosses, 66), Palamo, Varndell; Pisi (Jarvis, 69), Cliff (Roberts, 49); Bevington (Tonga\u2019uiha, 28), McMillan (Brooker, 49), Perenise (Cortes, 69), Evans (Phillips, 49), Joyce, Lam (capt; Crane, 59), Robinson, Eadie.</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Lam, Eadie, Cortes <strong>Cons </strong>Eadie, Jarvis <strong>Pen </strong>Pisi</p> <p><strong>Attendance</strong> 12,280. <strong>Referee</strong> Tim Wigglesworth (RFU)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/17/bristol-wasps-jason-woodward-premiership\">Bristol learning the hard way but Jason Woodward signing could be a coup</a> </p> </aside> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/17/bath-worcester-premiership-match-report\">Leroy Houston makes dream return as Bath battle back to beat Worcester</a> </p> </aside>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/story/0,3604,319669,00.html\" title=\"\">Some finishes are so tight</a> it is impossible not to feel for the downcast losers. This north-east cliffhanger certainly belonged in that category, with Leicester having to channel the spirit of Harry Houdini to record <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/02/gloucester-leicester-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">their second improbable away win</a> of the season. Richard Cockerill conceded his side had been \u201clucky\u201d; his old Tigers team-mate Dean Richards felt the hosts had received little justice.</p> <p>It would all have been academic had Joel Hodgson, from point-blank range in front of the posts in perfect conditions, not dragged a potentially match-winning drop goal wide. Given Leicester were down to 14 men at the time and had contentiously avoided being penalised at the two final scrums of the match, the verdicts of both Cockerill and Richards were perfectly valid.</p> <p>Cockerill was also right to point out that \u201cneither side played well enough to take the referee out of the equation\u201d. Newcastle, in particular, failed to nail down three more clear try-scoring opportunities and missed two kickable penalties. It was interesting, even so, to hear Richards relaying a wry conversation he had with Leicester\u2019s assistant coach Geordan Murphy on the sidelines as the dramatic final seconds ticked down. Murphy suggested to Richards that the referee JP Doyle \u201cwas never going to give a deciding penalty on the basis of the scrum going backwards\u201d. Lo and behold he was proved right, even when Tom Youngs and Ellis Genge were forced up and out of the scrum by their frenzied opponents.</p> <p>The reluctance of officials to make match-turning last-gasp calls is entirely natural but, equally, that is their job. An 80th minute offence has to count the same as one committed in the first or 31st; Newcastle\u2019s achievement in shoving the visitors off their own ball with the clock showing zero deserved greater reward. \u201cIf [the referee] was consistent, he would have looked at what went on before,\u201d Richards said. \u201cIt is a tough call to make that decision in the final minute but it probably would have been the right one.\u201d</p> <p>Then again the Falcons only won on the opening weekend because Sale\u2019s kicker, Dan Mugford, missed a last-second penalty; on this occasion the boot was on the other foot. It made for a truly gripping finish, with Dominic Waldouck being hauled down six metres short by the one-time local favourite Mathew Tait, when a match-winning try seemed imminent against a Tigers defence lacking the sin-binned Peter Betham. The Falcons were also left to lament a disallowed try when Waldouck was penalised for a double movement. \u201cIf he thinks that is a double movement perhaps he needs to go to the TMO to check,\u201d Richards said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to double-check things like that. When you look at the opportunities we didn\u2019t take it\u2019s pretty frustrating ... we should have won.\u201d</p> <p>Cockerill agreed, admitting his team \u201chave a lot of things to fix\u201d prior to the home game against an in-form Bath on Sunday. Ultimately the Tigers were indebted to a try from the industrious Mike Fitzgerald and three penalties from Freddie Burns, not to mention Hodgson and Newcastle\u2019s starting fly-half, Mike Delany, who struck a post with a first-half penalty attempt that really should have gone over.</p> <p>The players could hardly blame the weather. It was warm enough on the sunny clubhouse side of the ground before kick-off to make it feel more like Sabina Park, Kingston than Kingston Park, Newcastle. There was barely even a breeze to sway the local palm trees and the artificial turf merely seemed to add to Leicester\u2019s discomfort. This was summer rugby in every respect bar the date and the Falcons, keen to play more rugby this year, did their best to take advantage.</p> <p>The home side could have registered three tries before half-time alone but managed only one, scored in the sixth minute when the scrum-half Sonatane Takulua slipped the Argentinian centre Juan Pablo Socino through a midfield gap to score by the posts. A subsequent concerted period of forward pressure should have produced further reward, only for the ball to be spilt at the crucial moment.</p> <p>Leicester have made a habit of starting sluggishly this season, having won from 31-7 down against Gloucester before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/10/leicester-wasps-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">giving Wasps too much of a head start</a> in round two. They were fortunate not to go further behind here, when only their expertise at slowing down the Falcons\u2019 ball at the rucks and valiant defence kept them afloat.</p> <p>Mark Wilson, Simon Hammersley and the replacement Daniel Temm all deserved better but a failure to turn pressure into points against Leicester is never a recipe for happiness. A second Burns penalty gave the Tigers the lead for the first time entering the final half-hour and the Falcons started to make the costly errors that undid them so spectacularly in Bath the previous week.</p> <p>Betham\u2019s removal threw them one last lifeline. After Will Witty had broken clear, only for his pass to bobble forward, \u2013 no laughing matter \u2013 salvation beckoned again when Leicester\u2019s scrum splintered one final time. It should have won the Falcons the game but a combination of the fates, indecisive officiating and Hodgson\u2019s snap hook decreed otherwise.</p> <p><strong>Newcastle</strong> Hammersley; Goneva, Waldouck, Socino, Sinoti; Delany (Hodgson, 60), Takulua (Young, 61); Vickers, Lawson (Sowrey, 72) Welsh, Green, Olmstead (Witty, 66), Wilson, Welch (capt), Hogg (Temm, 69).</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Socino. <strong>Con</strong> Delany. <strong>Pens</strong> Delany, Hodgson.</p> <p><strong>Leicester</strong> Tait (capt); Veainu, Betham, Williams (Roberts, 65), Pietersen; Burns (Thompstone, 80), B Youngs; Genge, McGuigan (T Youngs, 50), Cole, Fitzgerald (Slater, 72), Kitchener, Williams, O\u2019Connor, Hamilton (Evans, 66).</p> <p><strong>Try</strong> Fitzgerald. <strong>Pens</strong> Burns 3.</p> <p><strong>Sin-bin</strong> Betham 71.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> JP Doyle (RFU). <strong>Attendance</strong> 6,570.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/17/bath-worcester-premiership-match-report\">Leroy Houston makes dream return as Bath battle back to beat Worcester</a> </p> </aside> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/17/bristol-wasps-jason-woodward-premiership\">Bristol learning the hard way but Jason Woodward signing could be a coup</a> </p> </aside> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/17/bath-worcester-premiership-match-report\">Leroy Houston makes dream return as Bath battle back to beat Worcester</a> </p> </aside> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/17/saracens-northampton-premiership-match-report\">Saracens slug it out to defeat Northampton in Premiership battle</a> </p> </aside>",

While France\u2019s mainstream parties on the left and right are yet to choose their candidates, Le Pen, who will stand for the FN, calmly claims to have the upper hand.<br></p> <p>A glitterball lit up the hangar on Saturday night as she hosted a gala dinner at the party conference to mark the preparations for her 2017 French presidential bid, at one point parading with a trained eagle on her arm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c0a88760097ee457a25c991be3dc33b0d5dc91b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c0a88760097ee457a25c991be3dc33b0d5dc91b/0_359_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Le Pen delivers her speech during the Fr\u00e9jus rally.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Le Pen delivers her speech during the Fr\u00e9jus rally.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Paul Pelissier/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All polls show that she will easily make it into the final round run-off in May.

Le Pen has been alone among French political leaders in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/20/marine-le-pen-could-campaign-for-uk-to-leave-eu-referendum\">loudly backing</a> both Brexit and Trump. </p> <p>The nationalist, anti-immigration, anti-European Union FN, which wants to leave the euro and favours French people over immigrants in giving out state benefits, remains the most significant far-right party in western Europe and has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/19/front-national-secret-welcome-provincial-france-elections\">made big electoral gains</a> in recent years.

Despite Le Pen\u2019s sidelining of her father and party co-founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen, and her long quest to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/10/le-pen-feud-family-drama-in-battle-for-the-soul-of-front-national-and-france\">\u201cdetoxify\u201d</a> her party of the racist, jack-booted, antisemitic imagery of the past, a majority of French voters still question whether the party is capable of governing France. </p> <p>Outside Le Pen\u2019s heartlands there is a widespread fear of the party, which many continue to associate with the old tags of demagoguery, xenophobia or racism. The party still faces a barrage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/11/le-pen-french-tactical-voting-to-fight-rise-of-far-right\">tactical voting </a>by the right and left to stop it winning final-round votes \u2013 described by one Lille party worker as \u201cthe onslaught of an armada\u201d. This clubbing together of right and left parties against the FN prevented it from winning any constituencies in last year\u2019s regional elections despite taking a historic 6.8m votes. </p> <p>Smiling, Le Pen chatted to journalists backstage at her party conference, saying she was confident she could expand her electorate far enough to win. Her aim in this pre-campaign period is to present herself as credible, to move away from divisive positions and to re-position herself as a kind of calm, unifying authority. She said she would run a \u201cjoyous\u201d campaign. Her aides said she felt her chances were better than ever. \u201cWith the designation of Trump in the US, and Brexit, analysts should be a bit more modest, there\u2019s a global awakening,\u201d Le Pen said. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/demagogues-and-cheats-un-human-rights-chief-condemns-trump-and-wilders\">'Demagogues and cheats': UN rights chief condemns Trump and Wilders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Above all, if Le Pen makes it through to the second round, she wants to avoid the fate that befell her father when he shocked France by reaching the final round in 2002.More than a million angry demonstrators took to the streets in protest against Le Pen senior who was subsequently squarely beaten when 82% of voters from all parties opted for Jacques Chirac, in order to keep the FN at bay.</p> <p>This time, if Marine Le Pen makes the second round, she is likely to seriously narrow the gap.

This serves to legitimise FN ideas, party members argue. </p> <p>While Sarkozy has controversially called for the locking up of anyone suspected of radicalisation even if they have committed no crime, Le Pen has sat back and argued for protecting the rule of law, aiming to show she is less divisive than him. </p> <p>David Rachline, the young FN mayor of Fr\u00e9jus who will serve as Le Pen\u2019s campaign director, said her ideas were now \u201cmajority-held views in France\u201d.</p> <p>Gilbert Collard, one of Le Pen\u2019s MPs, said: \u201cWho in France can say that everything\u2019s going well, that the economy\u2019s good, that there\u2019s security, that terrorism has been controlled, the nation preserved? If you look at our whole diagnosis of society\u2019s ills \u2013 you can hate us, but everyone knows that our ideas are being taken up and reproduced by everyone else.\u201d </p> <p>Nicolas Bay, the party\u2019s secretary general, said Trump and Brexit helped Le Pen\u2019s cause. \u201cIt shows French people that there\u2019s a patriotic dynamic that goes well beyond France.

Here, we ask what might happen next.</p> <h2>1. Smith wins: a new battle commences</h2> <p>Few Labour insiders are expecting Owen Smith to win. But there is little reliable polling, and Saving Labour, the lobbying group set up to campaign for a replacement to Jeremy Corbyn, claims to have done an effective job signing up trade union affiliates and non-members <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/20/labour-stops-crowd-funding-bid-to-help-supporters-pay-for-vote\">willing to pay the \u00a325 to register to vote</a>.</p> <p>The Pontypridd MP has presented himself as a unity candidate and promised to offer Corbyn the new job of Labour president \u2013 in charge of the grassroots party. But Corbyn has made clear he would not accept such a post.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/18/owen-smith-jeremy-corbyn-shadow-cabinet-elections-labour\">Owen Smith criticises Jeremy Corbyn's plan for shadow cabinet elections</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A Smith-led Labour party at Westminster could lure back many of the big-hitters who either refused to serve Corbyn originally or deserted him after he sacked Hilary Benn as his shadow foreign secretary in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.</p> <p>But a considerable cohort of pro-Corbyn MPs would be likely to return to the backbenches and make trouble for the new leader, and he would have to decide whether to pick a battle with Momentum, the pro-Corbyn grassroots campaign group. </p> <p>Early on in the campaign, Smith appeared to suggest he would seek to win over Momentum and its many thousands of activists, but his attitude has hardened over the past few months. The tough language of his final speech \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/owen-smith-momentum-jeremy-corbyn-labour-leadership-host-body\">describing Momentum as a \u201cparty within a party\u201d</a> and comparing it to Militant, the hard-left group expelled from Labour in the 1980s \u2013 suggested he might be prepared to try to drive them out.</p> <h2>2.

Now we have to provide the most effective opposition we can\u201d, said one. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/18/momentum-activists-labour-jeremy-corbyn-feature\">The new left: don\u2019t call them Corbynistas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They also acknowledge that Corbyn\u2019s performance at Westminster set-pieces has improved recently, and admire some of the young Corbynistas who have stepped up to shadow cabinet roles vacated during the coup - the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, for example, who some believe may be being groomed as a potential future leader.</p> <p>If Corbyn and his allies, including John McDonnell, stick to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/corbyn-makes-conditional-peace-offer-to-hostile-labour-mps\">conciliatory script</a>, there could yet be just enough unity to create a more complete shadow cabinet; allow Labour to present a united front at Westminster; and help to heal the rift between the party in parliament and many of its new members.</p> <h2>3.

One Corbyn ally predicts it will be a war of attrition.</p> <p>This summer\u2019s leadership campaign has been bruising, and many at Westminster regard it as strengthening, not weakening Corbyn\u2019s hand. Yet it may not be the last challenge he faces before the 2020 general election.</p> <h2>4.

The Co-operative party\u2019s leadership has said it will oppose such a move, however, saying the party was \u201cnot a vehicle to be used by one political faction or another to advance their own agenda\u201d.</p> <p>At the opening of the Liberal Democrat conference on Saturday, Tim Farron issued an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/17/farron-invites-labour-and-tory-members-to-join-lib-dems\">open invitation for moderate Labour MPs</a>, especially staunch remainers, to join his party. \u201cMy simple offer to those liberals in other parties is: do you know what, maybe it\u2019s time to join a liberal party,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Party figures are poised to approach centrist Labour MPs at risk of deselection in their constituencies after boundary changes, with an offer to allow them to stand as Lib Dems. How receptive Labour MPs will be to such a suggestion, with the Lib Dems at 8% in the polls, is uncertain.</p> <h2>5.

If Momentum is, as it is seen by many, a party within a party, Labour moderates believe they too must create a similar movement within the party. It is understood that such a movement would be launched shortly after a leadership election loss to Corbyn. </p> <p>The tactics would mirror Momentum\u2019s rise from Corbyn\u2019s leadership campaign in 2015 \u2013 this time using Smith\u2019s campaign resources, including his database of volunteers, as a backbone for a new movement. </p> <p>Labour sources told the Guardian the new movement would need to be open and transparent to avoid the negative publicity MPs received during the perceived \u201ccorridor coup\u201d to get rid of Corbyn over the summer. </p> <p>The movement would launch with an umbrella identity for progressive Labour groups in parliament and outside, with researchers hired to develop policy. Moderates in the party who back such an endeavour see it as a way to try to take back the party without having to operate cloak and dagger and avoiding the trauma of a physical split. </p>",
  "<p>Jos\u00e9 Mourinho admitted some of his players are unable to cope with the pressure of playing for Manchester United at the moment and also stressed how they need to learn from their defensive mistakes after his side slumped to a third successive defeat on an afternoon that ended with the Portuguese once again criticising the match officials.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/18/watford-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">Manchester United stunned as Watford are spot-on with late show</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After losing against Manchester City and Feyenoord in the previous eight days United were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/18/watford-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">beaten 3-1 at Watford</a>, leaving Mourinho\u2019s side six points behind Pep Guardiola\u2019s City after five matches. Mourinho was unhappy that Watford\u2019s first goal was allowed to stand, with Miguel Britos appearing to foul Anthony Martial in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/sep/18/watford-manchester-united-premier-league-live\" title=\"\">lead-up to \u00c9tienne Capoue scoring</a>, yet the United manager also accepted that his players were poor in the first half and at fault for Watford\u2019s second goal.</p> <p>Marcus Rashford had equalised for United in the second half but Juan Camilo Z\u00fa\u00f1iga scored only 53 seconds after coming off the bench to restore Watford\u2019s lead. Troy Deeney then converted an injury-time penalty to seal Watford\u2019s first win over United since 1986.</p> <p>Reflecting on the way United\u2019s fortunes have changed since winning their first four games under him, Mourinho claimed he always realised there were issues to address, in particular in defence, where he suggested there was a mental as well as a tactical problem with the way his players are reluctant to press.</p> <p>\u201cI was completely aware that we were not the perfect team, that we had lots of players who are not end products and can make their own mistakes,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cMy only doubt was the way they can cope with the negative moments that come sooner or later. I feel that some individuals probably feel too much pressure and that responsibility.</p> <p>\u201cBut from a collective point of view I only have good things to say about them. If you analyse our three defeats in the last week, we were always the best team in the second half. We didn\u2019t start well today but then in the second half the players showed quality, intensity, desire, commitment and ambition. And we lost again in our best moment.</p> <p>\u201cI can split this into three factors: one is the referee\u2019s crucial mistakes \u2013 that\u2019s not in my control. Against Man City you know what happened in minute 55 [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/jose-mourinho-claudio-bravo-red-rooney-tackle-penalty\" title=\"\">when Claudio Bravo made the challenge on Wayne Rooney</a>], today you know what happened for the first goal, against Feyenoord you know that the goal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/15/jose-mourinho-unhappy-offside-feyenoord-goal-manchester-united\" title=\"\">was in an offside position</a>, so we were punished by these mistakes and I can\u2019t do anything.</p> <p>\u201cThe third thing is what is in my hands, which is the improvement of the team,the improvement of individuals, trying to stop with the defensive mistakes. I knew that I had a task because, for example, the first Man City goal and this second goal today, you can find an incredible similarity.This is tactical but it is also a mental attitude. It\u2019s something that you don\u2019t go there and in a couple of weeks everything becomes perfect. So we have to improve, no doubt, individually and collectively. And that\u2019s my job because lady luck you don\u2019t control and referees mistakes you don\u2019t control.\u201d</p> <p>Martial clashed heads with Daryl Janmaat before Watford took the lead and appeared to be suffering from concussion when he was taken off four minutes later, raising questions about why he had been allowed to continue in the first place. Mourinho claimed he did not know the nature of the injury. \u201cYou are asking me things that I can\u2019t tell you because I don\u2019t know why he came off, if he was injured in his knee, in the ankle or his head,\u201d he said. \u201cI promise you that I don\u2019t know. I just know that in that moment he\u2019s not in condition to carry on in the game.\u201d</p>",

He taught me how to look at a building, and how looking round a cathedral can be a detective exercise. I remember we spent about three lessons watching Bondarchuk\u2019s Waterloo and that he brought in Jaws for our last lesson before Christmas \u2013 but just fast-forwarded it to all the shark attacks. <br></p> <p>He had an odd obsession with woolly mammoths and always advised us to draw them on our papers if we ended up with leftover time in a class test.

John Hynam took us for this two-hour lesson. He would play a recording of things such as Martin Luther King\u2019s speeches, and we would then discuss the issues raised. Until these lessons we had been treated as schoolchildren, and learned everything by rote. Suddenly, we were asked for our opinions, na\u00efve though they may have been, and grown-up discussions followed. While I must admit school bored me and I disliked just about everything about it, I relished these sessions and my interest in both politics and modern history has endured. </p> <p>It has taken me 50 years to acknowledge the debt I owe this teacher and my main regret is that I was never able to go back and thank him for this first step in me being treated like a thinking human being.</p> <h2>\u2018\u201cHuh, and they call this education,\u201d he said\u2019</h2> <p><em>Patrick Neylan, 52, on Mike Hart</em></p> <p>Back when the 11-plus could get you a free place at a public school, I ended up at Dulwich College (a year below Nigel Farage, who was as bumptious, amusing and politically suspect as he is now). In a school where everyone did Latin from the start, physics teacher Mike Hart once cajoled a torpid class with \u201cAmo, amas ...?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He showed that there was more to education than stuffy traditional methods</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We dutifully chorused back: \u201cAmat.\u201d He then asked: \u201cAnd what colour is the live wire in a standard plug?\u201d To which silence ... \u201cHuh, and they call this education.\u201d</p> <p>Mr Hart was vigorous and enthusiastic with a talent for practical demonstration, in the spirit of science: doing things in the real world in order to understand how the world works. He showed that there was more to education than stuffy traditional methods. When my kids were small and learning through play, it was Mr Hart that I had in mind when I said: \u201cAll children are scientists.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Her vocabulary flummoxed us\u2019</h2> <p><em>Sue Wylie, 56, on Miss McDonald</em></p> <p>She vastly overestimated our brains and assiduity, so we were doomed always to disappoint. However, she opened our eyes to a love affair (in my case a lasting one) with history, and with education for education\u2019s sake. Her Americanisms amused us, and her vocabulary flummoxed us \u2013 realising that at age 12 none of us knew the word oligarchy, she insisted that we all had notebooks that she called \u201cglossaries\u201d. One of my classmates admitted it took her two years to understand the actual meaning of the word \u201cglossary\u201d.</p> <p>I remember her tweedy jackets and elegant hair, but most of all I remember her voice \u2013 a vehicle for her neverending enthusiasm. She taught us that truth may not be easy to spot, and is always open to debate, but you should never stop seeking it. </p> <h2>\u2018He would have been better suited to the 1800s\u2019</h2> <p><em>Wealands Bell, 52, on Cyril Watson</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e644440eb8a7041efd2d0b534d4dc13544598a61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e644440eb8a7041efd2d0b534d4dc13544598a61/0_8_341_341/341.jpg\" alt=\"Wealands Bell as a child\" width=\"341\" height=\"341\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wealands Bell as a child</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wealands Bell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cyril Watson, of Durham Cathedral Chorister School, was a man born in the wrong century. Although by the time he taught me in the 1970s he had already taught two other notable boys \u2013 Tony Blair and Rowan Atkinson \u2013 he would have been better suited to the 1800s, belonging to the sort of travelling theatre company created by Dickens for Nicholas Nickleby. All of his lessons were high-speed dramatic performances in which, armed with a few basic props \u2013 a rolled-up gown, a window pole, a pile of dusty books \u2013 he assumed the role of prelate or pikeman, unscrupulous courtier or threadbare peasant. Each week, the performances were summarised in a sheet of notes that were distilled from an Encyclopaedia Britannica and hammered out on an old Remington typewriter. These we learned for a test. Very old-fashioned, very effective. </p> <h2><strong>\u2018We were all a bit crushed when we found out he\u2019d got married\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Nora Dillon, 52, on Mr Behan</em></p> <p>We all adored Mr Behan, our history teacher at the west of Ireland convent where I and all my female forebears had attended. Among the stern nuns in musty black academic gowns he cut a swagger with his conquistador beard and love of history and debating. We really had no idea how old he was or what his backstory was \u2013 but were all a bit crushed when we found out he had got married one summer. He said he wanted us to think like adults, and what music to the ears of a micromanaged country girl that was. His classes were magic. No one in my family had even considered law as an option, and I had plenty of frank feedback about it being out of my league. Mr Behan was very supportive.</p> <p>Mr Behan continued to inspire generations of girls from that school, a very modest but academically successful convent school in Kerry. When he was appointed headteacher I wrote to him about my career as a lawyer and told him he had set me on that path with confidence and without fear. I am very grateful for his counsel and teaching and I am sure he will continue to positively influence the next generation. <br></p> <h2>\u2018She gave me a mix-tape.

Before she came along, me and drama didn\u2019t mix. I wasn\u2019t the kid with the big gob and a bucket load of confidence \u2013 the thought of having to answer a question in class sent my palms into sweat overload.<br></p> <p>She taught me that I didn\u2019t have to fit into the expected norm, it was OK to be the outsider and to still enjoy drama. <br></p> <p>Over the course of the next few years at St George\u2019s, in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, my confidence grew.

When other teachers were getting their classes to write stories about how they spent their weekends, Mrs Kiloh had us writing about the important things that happened in the world at the weekend. She made us look at things in a different way. </p> <p>She had a voice that boomed across the classroom and some feared the woman, but not us in the know. In my head, she was always dressed in smart, no-nonsense blouses and tartan skirts with bright red lipstick. I have taken much of what she taught me through my adult life, and now as a teacher myself I find myself \u201cdoing a Mrs Kiloh\u201d. A few years ago, she and I crossed paths and I had the pleasure of meeting her son Bruce. I told Bruce how his mum made me want to teach and how special she made us all feel. A few days later, Bruce called and sent me a photo of a recipe I\u2019d written and given to Mrs Kiloh about 39 years before \u2013 he told me that every family birthday she would get out the Dutch crunch recipe and have a plate freshly baked on the table.</p> <h2>\u2018There was a rumour she was an Iranian princess\u2019</h2> <p><em>Rebecca, 35, on Dr Habib</em></p> <p>Dr Habib was a passionate teacher. She told us we must care about maths like we did our favourite pop group \u2013 at the time I thought that was ridiculous. She set us twice as much homework as the top sets for GCSE and told us that she had predicted us all A*s. Every weekend we would do extra algebra tests from a book that must have been 50 years old. They would take hours and I resented it. </p> <p>But she also baked cakes for us and cried once (I think when I didn\u2019t do my homework and was being a petulant teen). Back then, I thought it was crazy. Now I wish I had told her what an amazing teacher she was and how her commitment and passion enabled me to get that A* in a subject I found hard. </p> <p>There was also a rumour that went round the school that she was an Iranian princess. I wish I knew what happened to Dr Habib \u2013 I think of her often when teaching my own students.</p> <h2>\u2018In our last year, he taught us university economics\u2019</h2> <p><em>Neve Hristova, 35, on Robert Bateman</em></p> <p>My favourite teacher was Mr Robert Bateman, who taught me economics and business studies while at Worksop College between 1998 and 2000. He was an extraordinary teacher who came at his students with a firm belief in their intelligence and ability to learn. I was a scholarship student who had just travelled from Bulgaria for sixth form college. He was the first teacher who made me believe I could really excel in a strange new environment, and that I had things to bring to the table, despite my acute case of being poor and foreign. <br></p> <p>I remember the way he would conduct his lessons. In our last year, he basically took us through economics theory taught at first-year university, lecture-style, and we were encouraged to ask questions. He didn\u2019t stint on his praise when we got things right, nor his ire if we were playing stupid. He made economics relatable and fun. <br></p> <p>He also wrote the best, most encouraging report card I ever received at college. I still have it, tucked away in an old economics textbook that I couldn\u2019t bring myself to get rid of.</p> <h2>\u2018I actually joined the Labour party because of him\u2019</h2> <p><em>Richard Williams, 36, on Mr Foley </em></p> <p>I had some great teachers at Haydon Comprehensive, Northwood, but none so tolerant of my arrogance and constant baiting of his left wing views. He taught me economics at A-level and I got an A. I would love for him to know that his views, always offered in a lighthearted non-condescending manner, had an impact on me later in life. I have actually joined the Labour party and switched from my rightwing economic views. He always had wise words, which I pass on. I miss and remember the Friday-afternoon \u201cgraveyard slot\u201d lessons. He, along with some other great A-level teachers ignited my academic interest.<br></p> <h2>\u2018She is the only teacher who wrote \u201crubbish\u201d across my essays\u2019</h2> <p><em>Michael Cooke,58, on Janet Peacock</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d794f69da5975faf6a1b70bb801f9500acd16344\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d794f69da5975faf6a1b70bb801f9500acd16344/0_495_1175_705/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Cooke has been searching for his teacher Janet Peacock for 30 years\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Cooke has been searching for his teacher Janet Peacock for 30 years</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Cooke</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ms Janet Peacock was an Englishwoman who taught me in the third form at Cornwall College, Montego Bay, Jamaica between 1970-71. I remember her ruthless honesty \u2013 she is the only teacher who both praised and also wrote \u201crubbish\u201d across my essays. She taught me think critically and to observe my own landscape and culture at a time when colonial education was still predominant in Jamaica. I now live in the UK and have tried for 30 years to find Ms Peacock and to say thanks. </p> <h2>\u2018He introduced me to the beauty of literature\u2019</h2> <p><em>Joan Opie, 60, on Mr Coleman</em></p> <p>My English teacher, Mr Coleman, was amazing. I was a shy child with a passion for reading, literature and poetry, who had just failed the 11-plus and was sent to the local secondary modern school in Redcar. For some years I secretly read poetry in my bedroom, hiding it behind a comic. As a working-class child there would have been nothing but torment and ridicule from my six siblings if they\u2019d known.<br></p> <p>Mr Coleman was the first person I met who had a similar passion. He introduced me to classic literature, which I absorbed and came to love. During the first term at Coatham County Modern School he read The Lady of Shalott to the class. I was mesmerised by the language and the way he expressed it. It is still my favourite poem today and I continually read and listen to it. Mr Coleman introduced me to the beauty of literature; something I have now passed to my daughter, who has just published her first book. </p> <h2>\u2018Twenty years later, the sparkle in his eye was contagious as ever\u2019</h2> <p><em>Richard Borek, 62, on Frank McQuay</em></p> <p>Frank McQuay was the first teacher at MJ Hobbs School in Hampton, Ontario, to even notice me as an individual, and to teach me that being distinct from the herd just made me an individual rather than an outcast. <br></p> <p>As a small and socially awkward grade eight student, prone to ridicule and occasionally bullying, he paired me with \u201cbig Pete\u201d, a large lumbering teen who had already been held back twice. Impressive as was his size, he also drove his own car to school, and was somewhat of an adult to us. Big Pete, (who became an electrician) needed a bit of help with \u201cbook learning\u201d and quite easily accepted my informal tutoring. I in turn enjoyed his unvoiced protection from any teasing. I only realised that this ploy was purposefully established by Mr McQuay a decade later. I met him some 20 years later and the sparkle in his eyes was as contagious as ever. A few years later, I found out he had passed and vowed that I would pay forward whatever intangible lessons he had taught me.</p> <h2>\u2018He let me ignite flash powder during the school play\u2019</h2> <p><em>Clive, 68, on Mr Griffiths</em></p> <p>Mr Griffiths, headteacher of my primary school in Waterloo, Merseyside, around 1957, was my inspiration. I asked him what the term \u201cimpedance\u201d meant (on a pair of old headphones). He gave me a book called The Foundations of Wireless and suggested it would provide the answer.</p> <p>It more than answered my question; it set in motion a fascination for radio engineering that would take me to more than 30 countries, installing radio stations. What I remember most about him was his humanity. In an era of the cane, he was an enlightened head and no corporal punishment happened in his school. He also permitted me to demonstrate my early knowledge of chemistry: I ignited flash powder during the school play and filled the hall with smoke. As a result of being inspired by him to follow a career that I loved, when I became a teacher myself I tried to do the same for my students. It paid off \u2013 the father of one of my ex-pupils phoned me to thank me for teaching his son how to code in Basic: he ended up with Google, in California. </p> <h2>\u2018We wore what we liked and went barefoot everywhere\u2019</h2> <p><em>Richard Tagart, 60, on Tony (Gerald Anthony) Lowther</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0c6f75adc7d622ea3c20fa8ba7c7a35551250f5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c6f75adc7d622ea3c20fa8ba7c7a35551250f5b/0_0_1032_1456/709.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Tagart\u2019s teacher Tony Lowther \u201cThe school was just outside the village of Jarvis Brook, near Crowborough in East Sussex &amp; operated from 1971 until well into the 1990s (moving to new premises in Mayfield in 1981). \u201c\" width=\"709\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Tagart\u2019s teacher Tony Lowther \u201cThe school was just outside the village of Jarvis Brook, near Crowborough in East Sussex.\u201d</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy Richard Tagart</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The son of a brigadier in the British Indian army and graduate of Trinity College Cambridge, Mr Lowther taught me for English and RE at Earnley School and was headmaster of Rotherfield Hall school, both of which I attended between 1969 and 1974. <br></p> <p>He had a wonderfully irreverent way of bringing literature and Bible stories to life. Rotherfield Hall was modelled on AS Neill\u2019s Summerhill and gave us the freedom to find out who we were, rather than trying to stuff us into predetermined moulds. We were on first-name terms with all adults, wore what we liked, did what we liked (except for having to go to class) and went barefoot everywhere all the year round. A truly unique education. <br></p> <p>I remember his sense of humour. We had a home farm and he was delighted that our new pigs were mating, announcing \u201cWe\u2019ve got sex in the pig sties!\u201d \u2013 without seeing my mother standing just out of sight. </p> <p>After university, I worked at my old school for several years before going to work overseas and stayed in touch with him until his death in 2008.

His father was an executive at Cathay Pacific \u2013 \u201cI think I have a deep guilt at having taken so many flights,\u201d he says \u2013 and his experience of other cultures encourages him to think that if people can be persuaded there are different ways of living without our overweening dependence on fossil fuels, we can switch rapidly to those other modes. \u201cYoung people see this,\u201d he says, as their exposure to the internet gives them a broader viewpoint of other cultures. \u201cMy grandfather doesn\u2019t believe in it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/18/deliciously-stella-clean-eating-instagram-comedian-bella-younger-interview\">Deliciously Stella: the Instagram sensation serving up raw Kinder eggs on avo-toast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His sense of urgency has deeply personal roots as well.

  "<p>Claude Puel\u2019s wait for his first Premier League win as Southampton manager is over. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he said, with a look of considerable relief. Charlie Austin\u2019s second league goal for the club was enough to condemn Swansea City to defeat and shake off any unwelcome records, namely the thought of the Frenchman failing to win any of his opening five league matches. Saints ditched another unwanted statistic too, securing their first clean sheet in 17 top-flight matches, largely thanks to Fraser Forster\u2019s giant right hand denying Gylfi Sigurdsson a late equaliser.</p> <p>Puel, who replaced Ronald Koeman in the summer, may just have learned his lesson. His Southampton side were supposed to be invigorated by their Europa League win over Sparta Prague \u2013 their first of the season \u2013 in midweek but they took an age to get out of first gear here. Puel made six changes to Thursday night\u2019s winning formula but defended his decision to keep Austin on the bench.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/18/crystal-palace-stoke-city-premier-league-match-report\">Andros Townsend shines as Crystal Palace overrun demoralised Stoke</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe played two days ago and it\u2019s not possible for a player to play all these games,\u201d said Puel, despite Steven Davis and Virgil van Dijk, among others, retaining their places in his starting lineup. \u201cIt\u2019s important when he starts and when he enters the game with a good spirit. Strikers can score at the beginning but also later in the game. I think it was a good decision.\u201d</p> <p>Southampton started slowly, as the Swansea winger Mo Barrow began to stretch his legs, drawing fouls from Davis and Shane Long. But slowly Saints awoke, eventually gaining control of a drab affair, Van Dijk forcing a smart save from Lukasz Fabianski, after his header from Davis\u2019s corner, while Long\u2019s frustrations were compounded when he was booked for diving by Mike Jones, after fishing for a foul from Federico Fern\u00e1ndez inside the box.</p> <p>Nathan Redmond, compared to Thierry Henry by Puel on the eve of the season, spurned Southampton\u2019s best chances as Austin, who scored twice against Sparta, looked on from the sidelines. Given another audition to impress as a false nine, the winger-cum-striker Redmond fluffed his lines. Dusan Tadic \u2013 again one of Saints\u2019 better performers \u2013 knocked the ball past the left-back Stephen Kingsley, before sliding the ball across to Redmond, who checked inside before driving his effort high over the bar. It was not exactly Row Z but frustrated home supporters began to sing the name of Austin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6be1279760a3269b8a17d5c833f5f6c0d214f99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6be1279760a3269b8a17d5c833f5f6c0d214f99/0_90_2896_1738/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nathan Redmond\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nathan Redmond fires over during a disappointing display.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Marsh/BPI/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing because he [Redmond] had all these chances,\u201d said Puel. \u201cHe had a few difficulties to score but next time he will be able to score two or three goals in the same game. He\u2019s a very good player with many possibilities, now it\u2019s just a question of time and experience. It\u2019s not a problem, it\u2019s important he stays with a good attitude.\u201d</p> <p>Kingsley was replaced by Angel Rangel at half-time with Kyle Naughton switching flanks, something of a testament to Tadic\u2019s display. It was Naughton\u2019s interception that proved vital three minutes into the second half, when the defender cleared Long\u2019s effort off the line. The striker was out of luck again less than 60 seconds later, tapping home from close range after the offside flag was raised.</p> <p>Austin was then called upon \u2013 replacing Long \u2013 and the script was already written. Jordi Amat, the Swansea defender, failed to properly deal with Tadic\u2019s cross, slicing the ball into the path of Austin, who ensured the net rippled emphatically. Francesco Guidolin introduced Swansea\u2019s \u00a315.5m record signing, Borja Bast\u00f3n, and Sigurdsson\u2019s low shot tested Forster late on but the visitors still lacked a cutting edge.</p> <p>For Swansea, the task does not get any easier, with two matches against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/17/manchester-city-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">a seemingly untouchable Manchester City</a> on the horizon. \u201cI am worried because if we play in this way in the Premier League, it\u2019s difficult to win any game,\u201d said Guidolin. \u201cI am thinking to change something. We have to think game-by-game but we have to improve. The opponents are important but our attitude has to change.\u201d</p> <p>Ki Sung-yueng shrugged his shoulders and walked past his Italian manager after being substituted, a week after Neil Taylor, left out of Swansea\u2019s 18-man squad at St Mary\u2019s, showed his frustration at being taken off <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/11/swansea-city-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">during the first half against Chelsea</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good attitude.

  "<p>This interview was meant to happen months ago, but was cancelled at the last minute, rescheduled and then cancelled again, and this carried on all summer. When at last we meet, Malia Bouattia&#xa0;apologises with consummate elegance, blaming pressures on a diary over which she has \u201cno control at all\u201d. I have a strong suspicion that this is not true. She offers it without a trace of unease, and I&#xa0;can\u2019t decide whether the grace of what I\u2019m sure is a&#xa0;deceit is really quite impressive, or offputting. In fact I can\u2019t recall ever feeling so&#xa0;many powerful but contradictory emotions about someone I&#xa0;have only just met.</p> <p>Bouattia\u2019s manner can be almost glassily cool, but I think that\u2019s to hide how nervous she is, and the vulnerability is very touching. But the next minute she can become formidably impressive, and fill me with admiration, and seconds later become maddening. By the end I\u2019m so angry, I\u2019m ranting at her like a lunatic. \u201cFor the record,\u201d I yell, \u201cthis has never happened before! I am not in the habit of shouting in interviews!\u201d I am dying of embarrassment when I leave, and at a loss to explain why this&#xa0;happened.</p> <p>Bouattia, 28, has had to deal with so much anger by now that you might think she would be immune to it, but I don\u2019t think she is. Before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/22/malia-bouattia-election-nus-president-deeply-divisive-jewish-student-groups\" title=\"\">she became president of the National Union of Students (NUS) in April</a> she served two years as the union\u2019s black students\u2019 officer, during which she rejected a motion condemning Isis. She was promptly branded a terrorist sympathiser by the press, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/24/new-nus-president-not-antisemitic-isis-sympathiser\" title=\"\">who chose not to report that her only objection to the motion was its poor wording</a>, which she wanted to correct. The deluge of death threats necessitated police protection, but still were nothing compared with the uproar her presidential election provoked. That Bouattia is the first black woman and first Muslim to be elected NUS president was lost in Fleet&#xa0;Street\u2019s frenzy to dig up old comments she had made that \u201cproved\u201d she was antisemitic.</p> <p>She had described the University of Birmingham as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/21/nus-president-malia-bouattia-must-redress-concerns-over-antisemitism-say-jewish-students\" title=\"\">\u201csomething of a Zionist outpost\u201d and on another occasion referred to \u201cmainstream Zionist-led media outlets\u201d.</a> More than 300 Jewish leaders complained. \u201cThis was a few years ago and I was talking about quite a particular context where there were a lot of activists that were very vocally supportive of the state of Israel and its actions. I was part of the Palestine society that, for most of the years that I was involved in it, was just trying to exist as a society let alone actually build solidarity, so it was because of that opposition, the constant tension and having disruptions for events that were taking place \u2026 you know, holding solidarity demonstrations and having opposing ones with Israeli flags flying, speakers being heckled. I wasn\u2019t being critical of the number of Jewish students or the size of the Jewish society at Birmingham. It was very much in relation to the opposition to any kind of Palestine solidarity efforts that were taking place.\u201d</p> <p>She clarifies that she simply meant that Birmingham\u2019s student union had the biggest and most vociferously Zionist Jewish society, and that she was referring to media outlets that promote a heavily pro-Israeli line, not evoking the old conspiracy theory about Jewish control of the media.</p> <p>Bouattia thinks the real reason for all the animosity is not antisemitism, but the radicalism of her leftwing politics. Though not a Labour member, she is a big fan of Jeremy Corbyn, and believes it was her promise of a bolder political agenda that won her the election. \u201cWe need action, and we need it now, and we need it differently to what we\u2019ve had before. We can\u2019t come to the table trying to compromise any more. That hasn\u2019t worked.\u201d</p> <p>But Bouattia\u2019s political ambitions go way beyond campaigning against education cuts or fee hikes. \u201cWe want a sense of international solidarity. We don\u2019t sit in a bubble. We have international students, migrant communities, and we can\u2019t sit by and be silent when spaces for education are for us to be critical of the systems, and of this country\u2019s role in escalating international crises, and escalating oppression of other groups. Liberation campaigns relate their work back to global movements for justice and solidarity, and we\u2019re much stronger when we\u2019re united.\u201d</p> <p>Personally, I find this both quite touching and perfectly appropriate from a student politician. But judging from an average turnout in student union elections of just 18%, the majority of undergraduates don\u2019t. I was a bit of a student political hack, and within that small world Bouattia is perfectly recognisable. To the overwhelming majority of seven million NUS members, however, her views and values, even the language she uses, are incomprehensible. If they don\u2019t share her commitment to fighting global injustice, but care about how to pay their rent instead, shouldn\u2019t their union leader confine herself to representing their interests?</p> <p>But the NUS is fighting on all fronts, Bouattia says, and it campaigns just as hard on education issues as, say, Palestinian rights. I wonder how much time she has ever spent in the company of apolitical students who came to university for the football, beer and toga parties, and are bewildered and alienated by NUS motions calling for the abolition of all prisons. Why does she think, I ask, that student voter turnout is so low?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a6bb8a594b1bdfa90531c9bd2ee9de3621b0af9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a6bb8a594b1bdfa90531c9bd2ee9de3621b0af9/0_23_4248_2549/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malia Bouattia, speaking at an NHS demonstration.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malia Bouattia, speaking at an NHS demonstration.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johnny Armstead/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s necessarily low if we compare it with voter turnout more generally.\u201d After I run through the average turnout for general, mayoral and devolved parliaments, she takes a new tack.</p> <p>\u201cOK, I think that when we think about the context in which we\u2019re in, where there\u2019s active demonisation of being politically active, you\u2019ve got the Prevent agenda [the government counter-terrorism programme to combat radicalisation], which is, like, actually hunting down students that choose to be politicised, particularly those who are racialised. We\u2019re at a time where things like the Prevent agenda quite explicitly target black and Muslim activists. I\u2019m seeing the realities of that, which is a turn away from taking political action. There is a total fear that they\u2019re going to be deported, and this is what they go home to. Their&#xa0;parents will tell them, \u2018You\u2019re going to end up in Guant\u00e1namo. You could end up deported to a homeland you\u2019re linked to, but have never even visited. You could end up having all your doors shut. You could end up being thrown out of university.\u2019 These are very real questions that people have to think about.\u201d</p> <p>Whether or not this is true, it still fails to explain why more than 80% of NUS members don\u2019t even turn out to vote. But I am struck by the scale of influence Bouattia accords to&#xa0;Prevent. Even if it frightened every single Muslim student away from politics, that would still only account for about 5% of NUS&#xa0;members.</p> <p>\u201cOh, but you see the Prevent agenda is not just simply targeting Muslims \u2013 as though an incredibly racist policy could even distinguish between the Muslims and non-Muslims. One black man with a beard and another, they all become Muslims, so, by extension, any racialised person becomes a target. And actually the agenda is targeting far more than that. It\u2019s a wider-reaching attack on politicised people and groups, anti-austerity activists, anti\u2011fracking activists, there\u2019s a whole host of people that this extends to now.\u201d Does she think Prevent\u2019s intention was always to target&#xa0;all forms of activism, and to use radicalisation as a convenient excuse to conceal grander ambitions?</p> <p>\u201cYes, I do believe that. I do believe that is has incredibly racist intentions, and intentions to crack down on people\u2019s civil liberties. I do believe&#xa0;that.\u201d</p> <p>If she could abolish Prevent today, what would she do to combat radicalisation? \u201cI would propose looking at the state of our foreign policy. And we\u2019ve cut every space of constructive engagement, like youth centres. Cost of living\u2019s increased, employment prospects are low, access to university is becoming ever harder. Even if people have accessed higher education, they\u2019ve accumulated vast amounts of debt. And have they had a positive experience, being forced to engage with content that doesn\u2019t relate to them, and perhaps is psychologically destructive? When we look at the incredibly Eurocentric curriculum, where people don\u2019t see themselves in what they\u2019re studying, and can\u2019t relate to it, and feel that their European counterparts hit the ground running, they can\u2019t see themselves advancing in the subjects.\u201d</p> <p>Bouattia says she has no ambitions for a political career, and sees her future in academia instead, which may be for the best, as I\u2019m not sure how her anti-radicalisation strategy would go down on the doorstep. But if her politics would strike most British voters as extreme, they make more sense from the perspective of her own life experience.</p> <p>Until the age of seven, she had a blissfully happy childhood in Algeria, but in the civil war academics became targets for abduction and murder, and the family fled to Birmingham. Taken in by Christian ministries, they found themselves in an alien world of brussels sprouts and a language Bouattia could not speak. She was fluent within two months, but remained desperately homesick, and consoled herself by drawing the Algerian map all over everything at school.</p> <p>After studying a degree in culture studies she read an MA in postcolonial theory at the University of Birmingham, before becoming the NUS black students\u2019 officer and then president. \u201cBut I think the sense of displacement is still with me. When Daily Mail articles are written, and quite racist, Islamophobic trolls come after you over social media, you\u2019re very much reminded that people don\u2019t feel you belong here. My parents took us out to access a better space of education, to be better equipped to go back to Algeria and give back.\u201d Her election was widely celebrated in Algeria, and she goes on: \u201cThat made me more at ease with all that I do here, and how it feeds into the bigger picture, because at times when you\u2019re so intricately involved in something locally, you start to wonder how does this fit into the bigger picture? How does this fit into the wider struggle?\u201d</p> <p>I ask if she worries that the antisemitism row has diminished her power as president. \u201cNot necessarily. Not so far,\u201d is a surprising answer, but she says that she thinks the controversy raised the profile of the NUS, and provided new platforms for her \u201cto put out our vision of the future\u201d.</p> <p>Does she think she has ever said anything antisemitic? \u201cI don\u2019t. I don\u2019t, and if my words were misinterpreted, then in future I\u2019ll take the time to make sure I break them down and explain them.\u201d Are there any comments she has made in the past that she would not now say?\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not about not saying it again, it\u2019s about just breaking them down to explain what I meant.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"244e604b1cdb07808f41aa137e918fe268f270f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/244e604b1cdb07808f41aa137e918fe268f270f5/0_300_6144_3686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Students at Cardiff university prote against a planned lecture by Germaine Greer in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Students at Cardiff university prote against a planned lecture by Germaine Greer in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Phillips/Gareth Phillips for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some Jewish critics still maintain that she is antisemitic. Others argue that anti-Zionism is antisemitic. Bouattia maintains that they have misunderstood and misinterpreted her, and are wrong. I think this would be a perfectly defensible position for her to take if only she applied the same principle when student unions invoke the NUS\u2019s no-platform policy. I want to talk to her about Germaine Greer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/18/transgender-activists-protest-germaine-greer-lecture-cardiff-university\" title=\"\">who Cardiff University students\u2019 union demanded be no platformed last year</a>, owing to her views on transsexuals. This is when the argument begins.</p> <p>Most graduates of my age, I say, are appalled by a campus culture that no-platforms a speaker for holding opinions some students might find offensive. If someone cannot bear to be exposed to challenging views at university, what are they doing there? \u201cIt\u2019s a case of seeing those ideas as spreading forms of hatred.\u201d Does she think that Greer spreads hatred? \u201cI support the union\u2019s right to no-platform her. To hold transphobic views spreads hate.\u201d</p> <p>But Greer has repeatedly stated that she does not hate transsexuals, is not critical of their choices, and couldn\u2019t care less if anyone wants to reassign their gender. She simply does not share the belief that a man who decides to live as a woman was female all along, or that surgical procedures can wholly reassign gender.</p> <p>Now a woman sitting at what is known as the liberation desk in the office, who works on campaigns for LGBT, black, female and disabled students, gets involved. What Greer thinks she means is not the point, she says; the trans community consider her a \u201cfascist\u201d, the NUS respects their view, ergo Greer is a fascist.</p> <p>But Bouattia doesn\u2019t accept that just because some Jewish people consider her antisemitic, that means she is. Why, then, does she not accord this principle to anyone else? \u201cThis is the NUS policy,\u201d she repeats. It\u2019s like talking to a speaking clock. I suggest that when a policy ends up branding Greer a fascist, it\u2019s time for an urgent policy review. Universities exist as places where people engage with ideas, and learn; they are not meant to be sealed panic rooms, are they? \u201cThis is the NUS policy.\u201d</p> <p>While I get more and more worked up, Bouattia just smiles placidly. I ask her to call her parents the next day and ask them if they, as senior academics, agree that Greer is too dangerous to be allowed to talk to students. When I email Bouattia later in the week, she doesn\u2019t respond, and the press officer tells me she is out of the country and uncontactable.</p> <p>I get the impression that Bouattia is more fragile than the persona she presents. But perhaps, if one\u2019s own academic parents have been targets for&#xa0;assassination, the concept of safety on campus holds something different to mine.</p>",

  "<p>Instinct suggests Stoke City have far too much pedigree to be loitering at the foot of the table for long but, with each thrashing they endure, the creeping sense of crisis grips tighter. This was a second successive drubbing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/stoke-city-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">to the tune of four goals conceded</a>, a rout inflicted by a Crystal Palace team who have been accused so often of being obliging hosts. But, whereas they have now forced their way into the top half Stoke shudder under the weight of the division.</p> <p>This was grim viewing for Mark Hughes and worse for the visiting fans left disgusted in the Arthur Wait stand. A team who have been rightly praised for transforming their attacking style, learning to flourish in possession, appear to have forgotten the basics in defensive organisation. Where once they were strong, aggressive and thoroughly drilled, now their back line was ramshackle and confidence brittle throughout. By the end it was shattered.</p> <p>They shipped three goals from set-pieces here, probably should have conceded more with a soft underbelly exposed and were tormented from flank to centre by the energy of Palace\u2019s front five. Andros Townsend ran amok, eventually enjoying personal reward by curling in a sumptuous first goal for the club, and the home side\u2019s fourth of the afternoon, from distance as all semblance of resistance evaporated. \u201cWe knew if we started fast, got in behind them and got crosses in, we\u2019d be a threat,\u201d said Townsend. That seemed basic, but it worked. Stoke never coped with his trickery or that of Wilfried Zaha on the opposite flank.</p> <p>Christian Benteke may not have scored himself but his mere presence unnerved Stoke at set pieces, permitting both centre-halves to register goals in the first quarter-hour. Throw in Jason Puncheon\u2019s wicked delivery, whether from dead-ball situations or open play, and the industry of the outstanding James McArthur and Palace were irrepressible. \u201cWe lost [Yannick ] Bolasie and James at around the same stage last season, both big blows and, to be honest, I don\u2019t know which one was the bigger loss,\u201d said Alan Pardew. \u201cJames gives an energy and assurance that we miss when he\u2019s not there. He was excellent.\u201d</p> <p>The same glowing tributes could be paid to players up and down his selection, and almost none of those in Stoke colours. This was a wretched display, typified by a troubling blend of carelessness and panic at the back. They were breached twice within 134 seconds early on, concessions which set the tone, with both utterly avoidable. James Tomkins should surely have been better tracked at Townsend\u2019s early free-kick, looped beyond Shay Given to the far post, but Jonathan Walters could only end up prodding goalwards from point-blank range in his desperation to intercept. Tomkins celebrated the gift with a touch.</p> <p>Just as inexcusable was the free run permitted Scott Dann moments later, the defender thumping his header down and through a Stoke player on the line. It would take Bojan\u2019s nod from the line to deny Dann a second after the interval with the visitors\u2019 dopiness still evident. If they had hoped to mount a recovery, then a failure to clear Puncheon\u2019s free-kick \u2013 another conceded needlessly by Marko Arnautovic \u2013 19 minutes from time scuppered their aspirations. McArthur was permitted to collect, cut inside and curl a shot that deflected in off Geoff Cameron. In truth, it was only Given\u2019s smart save from Zaha\u2019s backheel and a series of lunged blocks from a rearguard permanently at breaking point that prevented the home side running up a cricket score.</p> <p>In that context it was hard to pluck positives from the wreckage. Hughes could point to Arnautovic\u2019s emphatic finish beyond Steve Mandanda in stoppage time, providing only his team\u2019s third league goal of season, but the sloppiness had been as much in evidence among his forward thinkers. Bojan, still striving for full fitness, was peripheral. Wilfried Bony is a player still adjusting to new surroundings, with plenty of his shooting wildly inaccurate for all that it took a smart tackle from Damien Delaney to deny him a second-half tap in. Walters, too, missed a presentable opportunity after the contest had been surrendered.</p> <p>None of that amounted to grounds for much optimism. Instead Hughes was left drawing some kind of hope from his team\u2019s recovery from last year\u2019s disappointing opening, when they had accrued three points from six Premier League games. Their run of games ahead does, indeed, look encouraging but this is a team who have just subsided at Selhurst Park. They are not building from any proper platform, other than the memory of how well they have done in the last three seasons.</p> <p>\u201cClearly we didn\u2019t have a strong start last year too and turned it round,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cWe have to be more solid and resolute but we\u2019ve got a decent dressing room and experienced players who know how to win Premier League games. At some point that will come to the fore.\u201d</p> <p>Pardew had attempted to dissuade the home support from taunting his opposite number with their chorus of \u201cYou\u2019re getting sacked in the morning\u201d before the end. It has not quite come to that yet but Hughes will be the first to recognise that much of this was unacceptable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/sep/18/crystal-palace-v-stoke-city-premier-league-live\">Crystal Palace 4-1 Stoke City: Premier League \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3dea9630ca7b34bc319932ee0d8380de05324a13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dea9630ca7b34bc319932ee0d8380de05324a13/0_163_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Tomkins celebrates scoring his side\u2019s first goal on his full Premier League debut for Crystal Palace.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Tomkins celebrates scoring his side\u2019s first goal on his full Premier League debut for Crystal Palace.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Paston/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/18/watford-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">Manchester United stunned as Watford are spot-on with late show</a> </p> </aside>",
  "<p>The fraught family has been a staple of world drama from Aeschylus to Alan Ayckbourn. What makes Andrew Bovell\u2019s play unusual is that it is the result of a collaboration between the State Theatre Company of South Australia and the movement-inspired Frantic Assembly. Recast with British actors since its 2016 Adelaide premiere, it is beautifully staged but strikes me as spurious in its belief that suburban sadness is the same the world over.</p> <p>In plays such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/sep/29/speaking-in-tongues-theatre-review\">Speaking in Tongues</a> (filmed as Lantana) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/may/22/theatre-review-when-the-rain-stops-falling\">When the Rain Stops Falling</a>, Bovell has dealt ingeniously with loss of trust and the power of the past to shape the future. Here he dwells exclusively on the problems afflicting the Price family. Bob is a prematurely retired car-worker uneasily tending his rose garden while his wife, Fran, is a senior nurse who has made up for life\u2019s disappointments by raising a large family. </p> <p>The four children, however, are all at a point of crisis. The youngest, Rosie, has had her heart broken in the course of a trip to Europe, while the oldest, Pip, is about to walk out on her husband. As for the two brothers, one is struggling with his sexual identity, while the other is involved in dodgy financial practices. To have one troubled child is a misfortune: to have four looks like dramatic excess. While Bovell engages us in the plight of the rambling Rosie and the maritally pissed-off Pip, by the time we get, somewhat mechanistically, to their male siblings the law of diminishing returns sets in. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"974c07f2388f6409a6611094e75f0d17709e20a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/974c07f2388f6409a6611094e75f0d17709e20a6/0_433_5174_3105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Imogen Stubbs as Fran and Ewan Stewart as Bob.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Imogen Stubbs as Fran and Ewan Stewart as Bob.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bovell captures well the pathos of working-class parents who have invested all their hopes in the next generation, but there is something glib about the assumption that the stresses and strains of family life are identical whether you live in Adelaide, Accrington or Andover.</p> <p>The production, however, is a pleasure to watch. South Australia\u2019s Geordie Brookman and Frantic Assembly\u2019s Scott Graham, as joint directors, transform the stage from an empty space to a suburban garden and synthesise text and movement. The hands that caress Rosie\u2019s body during her opening monologue perfectly evoke the presence of her fly-by-night lover, while the later airborne lifting of Fran Price balletically captures the suppressed erotic dreams of a working mum.</p> <p>Fran is very much the dominant figure and Imogen Stubbs, playing her with a strong north-country accent, intelligently invests her with a rasping anger that conceals her passionate love for her fractured family. Ewan Stewart is equally good as the redundant Bob and at one point, as if in expression of vanished hopes, tilts his body forward at an angle of 45 degrees like the old music-hall comedian, Little Tich. Kirsty Oswald as the roving Rosie and Matthew Barker as the sexually uncertain Mark also impress in a strong cast. </p> <p>But, much as I welcome the collaboration between an Australian and British company, I question the play\u2019s supposed universality.

  "<p>Anyone who\u2019s ever watched toddlers playing in a sandpit knows that the concept of the death of the physical is vastly over-rated. These tiny tots \u2013 the very manifestations of Freud\u2019s self-obsessed, filterless id \u2013 will fixate on any worthless piece of plastic within their grasp, and will cut anyone who tries to come near it. \u201cMine!\u201d is the war cry of this generation (at least in their current, unsocialised guises). Physical objects are the simulacra of their mini selves, and ownership is their way of asserting control over their burgeoning sense of who they are. Like heck anyone\u2019s going to take that away from them.</p> <p>And yet there are predictions and bestsellers and trend look books that suggest that the future is not physical, but a clutter-free space in which we are surrounded by nothing but a handful of beautiful things.</p> <p>There are product makers who are trying with all their might to promote their versions of this streamlined, non-physical future by shaving off unnecessary extras. For example, earlier this month, Apple revealed its next generation phone. It does this literally every year. And literally every year, it crams more into something that fits into the palm of your hand. The current version has pixels on the screen that could have powered the Apollo 11 mission to the moon, at least part way. So that\u2019s a win for the end of stuff: iPhone has made a roomful of 50-year-old computers redundant.</p> <p>Apple is a kind of poster child for shearing off the unnecessary, shocking the status quo by making modifications to its products that seem genuinely to challenge the received wisdom about what a \u201ccomputer\u201d or a \u201cmobile phone\u201d actually is. With each groundbreaking release, its designers have successfully changed the public\u2019s perception by removing hard drives, memory towers and, now, the headphone jack. From now on, if you want to listen to music on your iPhone 7, you either use the same port as the charger, you use the enclosed adapter, or you do it wirelessly. Or you buy another adapter that lets you charge the device and listen at the same time.</p> <p>The public will have to jump in with both feet here. The company seems to know what it\u2019s doing; it predicted the USB revolution, the death of the CD-Rom, and has managed to get the power of a machine that took men to the moon into people\u2019s hands.</p> <p>On the surface, it seems that Apple is creating more, rather than less, physical stuff. Rather than lighten the load, the traveller\u2019s bag has become several wires heavier. But throw forward to a world where we connect to devices without wires at all \u2013 wireless charging stations, wireless headphones \u2013 and there is less, rather than more, to tote around. Apple has thrown the gauntlet down; now the rest of us must catch up.</p> <p>The classic 1984 Apple ad epitomises exactly this: the old, dark Orwellian army of worker drones is literally smashed to pieces by a revolutionary with high cheekbones wearing red hot pants and swinging a sledgehammer. Out with the old! Here is the new! To own an Apple product is to project a way of life that continually smashes the status quo.</p> <p>The Apple Way can never stop iterating or, in a recursive loop, it will have to smash itself. This is a lot to ask a device to do. And, in fact, the objects Apple sells have no inherent value. The company ensures that by inflating obsolescence with every year that passes \u2013 and every tantalising upgrade. And that is an invitation to discard.</p> <p>So much has been written about the minimalism promoted by Marie Kondo in her bestselling book <em>The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up</em> that it would spill out of the doors and windows of a Tokyo flat. Her way of being rides the wave of anti-physical zeitgeist: get rid of things in your life that don\u2019t \u201cspark joy\u201d and live a more peaceful life in an empty house. It, and the cultures that are excited by it, are natural reactions to the overindulgences of the 20th century: insane accumulation and, ultimately, reality TV shows about hoarders.</p> <p>On the one hand, the fashion towards Kondo-style purging is the epitome of 21st-century capitalist privilege. Mercilessly discarding our physical surroundings in favour of inner peace will work for your joy factor, until you need to furnish a kids\u2019 party with paper plates and plastic cups. A cash-and-carry may not be the most personally fulfilling or joyful place to shop, but it is economical. And that one thrifty decision has filled your cupboards with 250-count napkins.</p> <p>On the other, the move to non-physical is a reaction to the modern economic condition. Young people can\u2019t afford their own homes and, if they can, they\u2019re scarcely larger than a shoebox. The fewer objects the digital nomad has, the less that has to be lugged around. But the post-physical generation who eat up the KonMarie Method, and the millennials for whom \u201chome\u201d equals a laptop and an internet connection, are faced with the death of the baby-boomer generation, the greatest demographic in history. And when that happens, they\u2019re going to have to hold every object that once meant something to someone whom they valued, and decide if it sparks joy or not.</p> <p>There is \u2013 or rather, there was \u2013 a pair of rose-coloured plastic vintage sunglasses on the shelf at the Oxfam branch on Nicolson Street in Edinburgh. There was nothing that set these specs apart from the rest on the shelf except that they were the only ones that had a white tag hanging from the temple on a piece of string. On one side, \u201cOxfam\u201d was stamped in a shade of lime green that, strangely, naturally matched the decade of the item it was attached to. On the other was a QR code, a boxy black and white icon. When it was read using an app on a phone, this physical manifestation of a hyperlink took the viewer through a wormhole that made the sunglasses infinitely more valuable than the rest.</p> <p>These sunglasses had been owned by a woman in her late 50s who had held on to them through various culls because she remembered wearing them around town in her 20s \u2013 specifically, on a seaside first date with a long-discarded boyfriend. They had had fish and chips wrapped in newspaper, and had walked along the waterfront before catching the bus back to town.</p> <p>All of this was precisely captured for the Shelflife project, a material cultures research study co-sponsored by the charity and the University of Edinburgh\u2019s art department. People who donated items to charity shops were asked to write down what it was, and examples of when they used it.</p> <p>Each physical object is part of a \u201cvalue constellation,\u201d reflected the project\u2019s lead, Chris Speed. In addition to observing how stories affected their price, Speed and his team were interested in unlocking what was in a person\u2019s mind\u2019s eye when they described the thing they were discarding. \u201cThere is extraordinary in the mundane,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A physical object becomes more valuable when the shared experiences are somehow expressed, and this is what the Shelflife project tried to do. And there are other examples of objects that even more explicitly represent collective meaning. After all, what is a society other than a collective agreement of the meaning of objects? The personal story attached to the tagged sunglasses make their value much greater in Marie Kondo\u2019s world. They probably have a greater meaning than the car iPhone charger you picked up at a service station because your battery was almost dead.</p> <p>But, in fact, an old, used iPhone wouldn\u2019t fly off the shelf in Oxfam any faster if it had one of Chris Speed\u2019s QR codes attached to it. The irony is that the mobile phone\u2019s social and intentional use is as an object of communication, but it\u2019s the sim card inside that may have more actual value than the phone itself. And even that only has value to the person using it. The device only represents potential, but that can\u2019t be realised without the other things that actually make it work.</p> <p>In fact, as our technological urges progress towards well-designed, physical objects that consolidate multiple solutions within single beautiful boxes, each device will be infinitely more precise, more connected and more smart. But this will render them infinitely more disposable \u2013 because they will be concepts, rather than objects.</p> <p>We will continue to absorb objects at the same rate as they\u2019re produced, quite possibly in greater quantities as the wheels of consumption are greased by compulsive clicks and same-day deliveries. But these objects will be transitory consumables, without inherent value \u2013 or \u201cjoy sparks\u201d, for those indoctrinated into the magic of tidying up \u2013 and won\u2019t last long enough to become as meaningful to us as the plastic personal identifiers that the children in the playground defend as if their little lives depended on them. As soon as our present is clear of clutter, our future will accidentally fill it.</p>",
  "<p>The former head of the Royal Navy has called on the Ministry of Defence to crack down on illegal metal scavenging from sunken battleships amid claims that more than half of the war graves from one of the first world war\u2019s largest naval battles have been pillaged. </p> <p>Lord Boyce, a former admiral of the fleet and head of the British armed forces, told the Guardian the practice was \u201cvandalism\u201d and was comparable to stealing headstones from a military cemetery. </p> <p>He spoke out as the last missing ship from the Battle of Jutland \u2013 which cost the lives of 8,645 British and German sailors in 36 hours of combat off the coast of Denmarkin June 1916 \u2013 was found so far untouched almost 100 years after it was sunk by German shelling. </p> <p>Boyce\u2019s grandfather Albert Boyce, a navy petty officer, was on board the armoured cruiser HMS Warrior as it went down in what some naval historians consider the largest sea battle in history. Germany hoped to end British control over the North Sea, which restricted its trade. </p> <p>Petty Officer Boyce survived, but 71 of his crewmates perished. One shell alone killed 40 men, while ships\u2019 doctors could not cope with the number of people who needed amputations, with many men dying as they waited, according to survivors\u2019 accounts. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c2541ffb3637795c33396371a13ebfffdf3bc39e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2541ffb3637795c33396371a13ebfffdf3bc39e/15_31_200_250/200.png\" alt=\"Petty Officer Albert Boyce\" width=\"200\" height=\"250\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Petty Officer Albert Boyce survived but 71 crewmates perished when HMS Warrior was sunk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cA shell came through the upper deck and killed three of my mates working with me \u2013 another mate had his leg blown off,\u201d recalled Stoker 1st Class David Williams. \u201cI got hit myself. The sick berth steward tried to bandage me and as he did another shell came and blew off his two middle fingers.\u201d </p> <p>Dr Innes McCartney, a marine archaeologist who with other wreck hunters discovered the HMS Warrior upside down 83 metres beneath the surface of the North Sea, said that despite their status as war graves 16 of the other 24 British and German wrecks he has seen from the pivotal battle have already been pillaged for items including huge bronze propellers and boiler condensers that melted down can each be worth as much as \u00a365,000.</p> <p>He said that he had seen clear signs of looting on the HMS Queen Mary \u2013 the grave of 1,266 sailors.</p> <p>\u201cThe damage they have done to the wreck was observed by us in 2014,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere once the stern of the ship was intact, it has now been smashed open to remove the condensers from the ship.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPyP0MYjwE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IBPyP0MYjwE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>A 3D animation of HMS Warrior on the seabed.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>New footage of the ship shows it has lain undisturbed for the last century except for shoals of cod swimming around its upturned hull. Huge propellers are visible along with the bases of several of the gun turrets. </p> <p>Commercial metal salvage companies are believed to have been operating across the North Sea battlefield in recent years without being challenged by British authorities despite the wrecks being covered by the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986, which makes it illegal for Britons to disturb them, and under sovereign immunity that could allow overseas prosecutions.<br></p> <p>McCartney said scavenger ships were known to drop five-tonne chisels to break open wrecks, which could also contain human remains, before using mechanical grabs to haul components out from the deep, taking them ashore and melting them down.</p> <p>\u201cThe MoD should chase these things down,\u201d said Lord Boyce. \u201cWhen I was involved in the MoD we took grave looting quite seriously and I absolutely believe that criminals should be pursued to discourage others as much as anything else. When an underwater grave is found, ie HMS Warrior, and it is given respect, it is good for the people in the navy today to know that one day they will be recognised if your boat is found and is being respected as a grave. </p> <p>\u201cI know of families, and this is something I have done, who have sailed over a grave and dropped a wreath. You can come to some sort of closure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s is fantastic that the wreck has been found,\u201d added Andrew Biggs, a vet in Devon whose grandfather, Vincent Barkly Molteno, captained HMS Warrior. \u201cThere is a lot of effort to keep it as it is as a lot of these ships have been raided. These are war graves. They should be left alone to show respect.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc12be728b099a2d60c517d21ca32341228babef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc12be728b099a2d60c517d21ca32341228babef/268_0_3099_1860/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The wreck of HMS Warrior was found halfway between Scotland and Norway.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The wreck of HMS Warrior was found halfway between Scotland and Norway.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imperial War Museums/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>McCartney, who discovered HMS Warrior halfway between Scotland and Norway on 24 August with colleagues from the Sea War Museum in Jutland and the marine exploration company JD Contractor, said other wrecks had already been \u201chammered by metal thieves\u201d. HMS Warrior was still \u201cpristine\u201d, he said, but \u201cthis is the last chance the Ministry of Defence has to protect a war grave from the Battle of Jutland\u201d.</p> <p>An MoD spokesman said: \u201cThe United Kingdom strongly condemns the desecration of any site of maritime military remains. We endeavour to protect these important sites and any illegal activity should be reported to the Ministry of Defence police. We are not aware of any illegal salvage activity taking place on other Jutland wreck sites.\u201d</p> <h2>A letter to \u2018you warriors\u2019 from the doomed ship\u2019s captain</h2> <p>The day after the sinking of the HMS Warrior, Captain Molteno wrote to Albert Boyce and each of the other survivors, praising their bravery.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWe have just experienced a time the like of which has never been known during English history,\u201d he said, according to a copy of the letter kept by Lord Boyce.</p> <p>\u201cI am proud to be in command of such a large body of men. You behaved magnificently and I have applied to the admiralty to keep you all together and put me in command of you warriors. </p> <p>\u201cI have also asked for leave for all of you to go home and see you friends and you can be cock-a-chest for you will get at least 10 days. Your courage was magnificent. Not one had any thought for himself, but everyone tried to save the ship and render aid to the wounded and dying. </p> <p>\u201cI would not have believed it would be possible to get a ship into such a hell and come out again with so many survivors \u2026 We have the satisfaction of knowing that we sank a large German cruiser before we were disabled and don\u2019t forget that we were under fire for 17 and a half minutes before from nine of their latest ships before we retired from the battle.\u201d</p>",

Red Bull had targeted pole this weekend at a winding circuit that suits them, particularly in the context of Mercedes\u2019 Singapore struggles last year, but the Australian had to settle for second with his team-mate Max Verstappen fourth. \u201cI am pleased enough,\u201d was Ricciardo\u2019s muted response. \u201cThe aim was to be on the front row and it is nice to be in front of one of the Mercedes.\u201d </p> <p>Behind them, Kimi Raikkonen is the lone Ferrari representative near the front after Sebastian Vettel suffered a mechanical failure and will have to weave through the pack. Toro Rosso qualified well with Carlos Sainz sixth and Daniel Kvyat seventh, while Fernando Alonso starts ahead of the two Williams in ninth. Hamilton must ensure that, at a minimum, his troubles off the start this season don\u2019t leave him swallowed up by the chasing pack come Turn 1.

She came across the clean-eating phenomenon, headed by the likes of Mills, Alice Liveing, aka <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clean_eating_alice/?hl=en\">Clean Eating Alice</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.hemsleyandhemsley.com/\">Hemsley sisters</a> (#TheArtOfEatingWell, #GoodAndSimple). \u201cI spent an afternoon on Instagram, looking at the hashtag eatclean \u2013 I couldn\u2019t believe how many handstands there were, and how there could be so many avocados in the world,\u201d she says. Her boss challenged her to start her own version, and she came back after the weekend with her Deliciously Stella parody, and 25 followers on Instagram.</p> <p>Younger was also an aspiring comedian, and was writing a show for the Edinburgh festival at the time. (\u201cIt was called Champagne Socialist \u2013 about how I come from a Tory political dynasty, but I\u2019m quite left wing, and how disgusted my family are with that, and how hard I tried to be cool and lefty, but I have a posh voice and everything went wrong.\u201d) She had unexpectedly landed an hour-long slot, having only performed a handful of five-minute gigs before, and \u201cwas a bit worried no one would come and see it. I thought if I get [Deliciously Stella] on Facebook, maybe I won\u2019t perform to an empty room.\u201d</p> <p>So she \u201cspent a lot of time stalking people [on Instagram] and leaving cringy emojis \u2013 clean-eating people, famous people, people who used the same hashtags\u201d to get them interested in Deliciously Stella, and eventually Davina McCall took note. McCall\u2019s attention brought Deliciously Stella 1,000 followers; today she has 131,000 and a just-published book, in which she \u201cshares the #cleaneating life hacks she swears by to achieve a #strongnotskinny look and a #blessed outlook on life\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A normal person can't eat [the clean-eating way] and do everything they need to do.

  "<p>India has directly accused Pakistan of involvement in a deadly raid on a Kashmir army base that killed 17 soldiers, labelling its neighbour \u201ca terrorist state\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/nine-indian-soldiers-and-four-militants-killed-in-kashmir-attack\">Sunday morning\u2019s attack</a> on the army camp near the disputed border with Pakistan was among the deadliest against security forces in Kashmir history, and sparked grief and anger across India.</p> <p>The death toll could yet grow, with about 35 soldiers injured, some critically.<br></p> <p>Four <em>fedayeen</em> \u2013 highly trained militants on what are essentially suicide missions \u2013 died in the three-hour assault on the base at Uri, near the militarised \u201cline of control\u201d that divides Indian Kashmir from the Pakistan-controlled side. </p> <p>The Indian army\u2019s director of general military operations (DGMO) said none of the four men was from the Indian side and that some of their equipment had Pakistani markings. </p> <p>It claimed they were members of Jaish-e-Mohammed, a militant group alleged to have links to elements within the Pakistani government. </p> <p>About 13 or 14 of the soldiers died in fires started by the militants\u2019 incendiary ammunition, which consumed the temporary shelters and tents in which they had been sleeping. A rotation of units was under way, meaning more soldiers had been stationed on the base than usual, the DGMO said.</p> <p>Rajnath Singh, the Indian home minister, cancelled an overseas trip and held an emergency meeting on Sunday afternoon with top security officials. In a series of tweets, he accused Pakistan of responsibility for the attack.</p> <p>\u201cI am deeply disappointed with Pakistan\u2019s continued and direct support to terrorism and terrorist groups,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are definitive and conclusive indictions that the perpetrators of [the] Uri attack were highly trained, heavily armed and specially equipped. Pakistan is a terrorist state and it should be identified and isolate as such.\u201d</p> <p>Condemning the \u201ccowardly\u201d attack, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, said he could \u201cassure the nation that those behind this despicable attack will not go unpunished\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe salute all those martyred in Uri. Their service to the nation will always be remembered. My thoughts are with the bereaved families,\u201d he added.</p> <p>India\u2019s president, Pranab Mukherjee, said the country would not be cowed by the attack. \u201cWe will thwart the evil designs of terrorists and their backers,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Former army officials and members of Modi\u2019s own party called for a more bellicose response than the largely diplomatic routes pursued after the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai or a January attack on a Punjab army base that killed seven.</p> <p>\u201cFor one tooth, the complete jaw,\u201d said Ram Madhav, the general secretary of the ruling Bharatiya Janata party. \u201cDays of so-called strategic restraint are over. If terrorism is instrument of the weak and coward, restraint in the face of repeated terror attacks betrays inefficiency and incompetence. India should prove otherwise,\u201d he said.</p> <p>No group has claimed responsibility for the assault and Pakistan has denied any involvement. Pakistan\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, Nafees Zakaria, told Reuters: \u201cIndia immediately puts blame on Pakistan without doing any investigation. We reject this.\u201d</p> <p>Hostility between the nuclear neighbours was already high after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/12/kashmir-braces-for-eid-bloodshed-amid-summer-of-violent-protests\">summer of violent clashes</a> in Kashmir between security forces, protesters seeking greater autonomy or independence, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/11/kashmir-conflict-new-wave-militants\">militants India accuses</a> of being sponsored by Pakistan.</p> <p>More than 80 civilians have died in the ongoing protests and human rights groups have accused Indian police of using excessive and arbitrary force. Before Sunday, separatist attacks in Indian-controlled Kashmir had left 102 people dead so far this year, including 30 security personnel, 71 militants and one civilian, according to the South Asia Terrorism portal.</p> <p>Both India and Pakistan claim Kashmir as their own and have fought three wars over the former princedom since partition in 1947. </p> <p>Sunday attack\u2019s came during a week of diplomatic wrangling between the pair.

However, there was also an acknowledgement that improvement has to come from within. Mourinho talked about how \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/18/jose-mourinho-some-manchester-united-players-not-coping-with-pressure-watford\" title=\"\">some individuals probably feel too much pressure</a>\u201d and also highlighted the defensive vulnerability that an impressive Watford side brutally exposed.</p> <p>Luke Shaw\u2019s part in Watford\u2019s second goal was singled out, with the United manager frustrated that the left-back had sat back rather than pressed more aggressively prior to Juan Camilo Z\u00fa\u00f1iga restoring the home team\u2019s lead, yet there were plenty of other issues to address on an afternoon when Mourinho\u2019s side finished the game looking ragged and disjointed.</p> <p>Wayne Rooney, who was a picture of frustration throughout, finally took things too far in injury time and was booked for dissent by the referee, Michael Oliver. More misery was to follow for United a couple of minutes later when Marouane Fellaini tripped Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, giving Troy Deeney the chance to convert from the spot. His penalty was emphatic and sealed Watford\u2019s first victory over United since September 1986.</p> <p>While Mourinho was entitled to claim United looked the more likely team to win once Marcus Rashford had equalised, this was a far from convincing performance and too many players were on the periphery of the game. Paul Pogba hit the crossbar with a dipping shot in the first half but never did enough to impose himself and, rightly or wrongly, it is hard not to look at the Frenchman and expect so much more from the world\u2019s most expensive footballer.</p> <p>Ibrahimovic only came alive in the second half, when he had a hand in Rashford\u2019s goal and also drew a superb save from Heurelho Gomes with a far-post header. Before that the Swede looked flat, much like the rest of a team who were fortunate not to concede long before Capoue\u2019s opener.</p> <p>Watford caught them cold and started superbly. The unmarked Sebastian Pr\u00f6dl headed narrowly wide just before Odion Ighalo filed an early contender for miss of the season. It was a chance that came about following a breakdown in communication between David de Gea and Chris Smalling. Both players challenged for the same high ball, De Gea was unable to gather cleanly and Ighalo inexplicably sliced wide with the goal yawning invitingly in front of him.</p> <p>The home team carved open a third chance when Daryl Janmaat swung in a cross that Deeney, towering above Antonio Valencia, met with a powerful header that De Gea clawed away one-handed. There were only 17 minutes gone and it was tempting to wonder when United would grab hold of the game. They improved in that brief period when Pogba hit the woodwork but Watford continued to look dangerous and it was no surprise when Capoue scored.</p> <p>Whether the goal should have been allowed to stand is a different matter.</p> <p>Miguel Britos dispossessed Anthony Martial deep on the United left but seemed to foul the Frenchman before getting to the ball. Oliver, however, waved play on and with United exposed on their left flank, Janmaat escaped and produced the perfect cut-back for Capoue, who dispatched a low shot past De Gea to register his fourth goal in five league games.</p> <p>Martial remained on the ground and was clearly in some distress following an incident that happened seven minutes earlier when he clashed heads with Janmaat. The United forward was unable to continue and questions will be asked as to whether he should have come back on to the pitch in the first place.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"284bff4e9ca6ff8d31f54bd5896d0124a179b87e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/284bff4e9ca6ff8d31f54bd5896d0124a179b87e/122_0_3146_1887/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u00c9tienne Capoue opens the scoring for Watford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u00c9tienne Capoue opens the scoring for Watford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mourinho sought to change things by replacing Valencia with Juan Mata and two minutes later United were level.

Whatever Mourinho\u2019s misgivings about Shaw\u2019s defending, it was a lovely move down the Watford right involving Nordin Amrabat and Roberto Pereyra that created the chance for Z\u00fa\u00f1iga to beat De Gea only 53 seconds after coming off the bench.</p> <p>Fellaini\u2019s foul on the same player enabled Deeney to add a third Watford goal and follow up the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/west-ham-united-watford-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">win at West Ham United</a> with an even more eye-catching result. \u201cI\u2019m happy for the fans,\u201d Watford\u2019s manager, Walter Mazzarri, said. \u201cThey told me it was 30 years since Watford have beaten Manchester United, so this win gives us a lot of satisfaction.\u201d</p>",

The inadequacies of the squad he inherited were pretty apparent during the defeats to Manchester City and Feyenoord, and Mourinho\u2019s selection for and reaction to the City game showed were not to all tastes. </p> <p>It would be wrong to overstate the significance of those defeats. United could easily have won a wonderful, unique match against City, and the Europa League is an irrelevance. But even if they had won both games, the obvious issues would have remained: a relatively weak spine, the form of Anthony Martial, the role of Paul Pogba, the existence of Wayne Rooney.</p> <p>Mourinho, criticised for so long for his short-termism, should be allowed peace and quiet to do what is at best a medium-term rebuilding job. No chance of that, and if United fail to win today they will already be five or six points behind Manchester City. A five-point deficit in September is not always something to worry about \u2013 but it is when the team ahead of you is managed by Pep Guardiola, a coach with the highest win percentage in football history, and you are at the mercy of an infantile, jerky-kneed media.</p> <p>Watford is not an easy place to go, and they will be on a considerable high after that spectacular win at West Ham last weekend.

Unable to bear the loss \u2013 or the stifling atmosphere of the small community in which she lives \u2013 June heads for a coastal motel once visited by her daughter, where she tries to piece together the stories of the lives that have been lost.</p> <p>What follows is a beautiful, heart-rending novel of quiet, understated tragedy, dissecting the relationships between parents and children, friends and lovers, neighbours and strangers.</p> <p>Told from multiple perspectives, Clegg\u2019s novel creates a rich tapestry of characters whose lives intersect around the fire. Clegg weaves their stories delicately, teasing out their connections with subtlety and authenticity, so that revelations are all the more shocking for their unexpectedness. This is a novel in which there are no secondary characters: every individual possesses their own, distinctive voice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/13/bill-clegg-interview-did-you-ever-have-a-family-booker\">Bill Clegg: \u2018I really understand the loneliness, excitement and vulnerability it takes to create a book now\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As well as being a study of love and loss, <em>Did You Ever Have a Family</em> is a skilful deconstruction of the preconceptions, gossip and judgments rife in small communities. June\u2019s former neighbours create their own narratives about both the cause of the fire and the private lives of its victims, in a searing indictment of small-town prejudices. As such, the novel is as much a commentary on storytelling as it is on grief; on the tales people tell themselves and one another to make events fit into their own narrow worldview.</p> <p>Ultimately, <em>Did You Ever Have a Family</em> is sensitive and insightful, heartbreaking and hopeful. Clegg has a perceptive understanding of the tribulations of parenthood and the transitory nature of relationships: \u201cNone of these people were ever hers. They either belonged to someone else or had lives or lies that put them out of reach, or should have.\u201d</p> <p>Near the beginning of the novel, a gossiping local woman comments on the fire: \u201cHow do you recover from that?

I was recently told of a brilliant British actor who was summoned to Albee\u2019s New York apartment for a reading of the play prior to an intended Broadway production with Patti LuPone. Albee\u2019s mounting dismay at the British actor\u2019s textual quibbles meant that, by the end of a long afternoon, all hopes of the production had been abandoned.</p> <p>Albee\u2019s protective attitude to his play stemmed in part, I suspect, from the fact that it is widely misunderstood. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/nov/20/mike-nichols-10-best-virginia-woolf-charlie-wilson\">searing Mike Nichols 1966 film</a>, starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, stamped it in the public mind as a liquor-fuelled marital slugfest. But the play, I am convinced, is as much about the state of the Union as about marriage. Albee was a deeply political writer who once told me he liked plays to be \u201cuseful, not merely decorative\u201d. It is also significant that he wrote the play in the early 1960s when America was slowly emerging from the narcoleptic Eisenhower years and when a fragile Cold War peace depended on the balance of terror.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a4b8f32c2491646b950b598539d76b589207ee7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a4b8f32c2491646b950b598539d76b589207ee7/0_463_4849_2910/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Suchet (George) and Diana Rigg (Martha) in Who\u2019s Afraid of Virgina Woolf at the Almeida in 1996.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Suchet (George) and Diana Rigg (Martha) in Who\u2019s Afraid of Virgina Woolf at the Almeida in 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was Howard Davies\u2019s magnificent Almeida production that fully awoke me to the fact that the play, apart from being about the stock American theme of truth and illusion, has even wider resonance. George and Martha, whose marathon battles we watch with appalled fascination, derive their names <a href=\"http://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/martha-washington/george-marthas-courtship/\">from the Washingtons</a>. They live in a college at New Carthage which evokes a classically ruined civilisation.

Meanwhile Nick, who gets laid by Martha, is a biologist credited with a chromosome-alteration scheme that will produce perfect future specimens. </p> <p>Albee\u2019s play embraces not only history and science but even religion in that Nick\u2019s father-in-law was a travelling preacher who managed to reconcile God and Mammon. We only think about this later. While watching the play we are hypnotised by the spectacle of a couple tearing each other apart. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/nov/11/edward-albee-a-to-z-delicate-balance-broadway\">An A-Z of Edward Albee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I was lucky enough to have caught the first London production in 1964 and my chief memory is of Uta Hagen and Arthur Hill starting on the lightest of notes before descending into Walpurgisnacht. Diana Rigg, playing Martha as an intelligent woman haunted by self-disgust, and David Suchet\u2019s George, hiding his disappointment behind a sardonic exterior, were equally unforgettable in the 1996 Almeida revival. And in 2006 Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/feb/01/theatre\">in a West End revival directed by Anthony Page</a>, showed there are no games without pain: I always recall Irwin slamming the door-chimes in agony as he realised Martha and Nick were about to retire upstairs. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.broadwayworld.com/westend/article/GYPSYs-Imelda-Staunton-in-Talks-for-WHOS-AFRAID-OF-VIRGINIA-WOOLF-in-London-20160630\">Rumour has it</a> that Imelda Staunton and Conleth Hill are to star in a new London production.

  "<p>\u201cIf you have a limb fall off, don\u2019t worry, just keep it and we will reattach it later,\u201d Amber Maykut announces to the class. I am in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, at a Sunday afternoon introductory taxidermy class. The eight assembled students, all dressed in black, are focused on peeling the skin off their still slightly frozen rodents.</p> <p>The mice, in a small mercy for me if not the mice, arrive already dead and come from a pet shop that sells them as snake food. After the students remove the mouse carcasses, Maykut carefully collects them in the Dollar Tree plastic bag she uses to transport them. The carcasses will be fed to her friend\u2019s pet snake, ensuring no part is wasted.</p> <p>Maykut is part of a resurgence in the dying art of taxidermy, once the province of rural hunting communities and now enjoying a renaissance in urban areas. Men in their 50s and 60s who specialize in creating big game trophies are still the majority of the profession, but a new breed of taxidermist is emerging to carry on the baton. The latest taxidermists are based in cities such as New York and Los Angeles, they are young, predominantly women, playful in their taxidermy compositions and committed to never killing for the sake of their art and using animals that have already been killed for other purposes<strong>.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d39436f90bad8a108314f1fd26ee55605565824\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d39436f90bad8a108314f1fd26ee55605565824/0_95_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maykut teaches a taxidermy class in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maykut teaches a taxidermy class in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Welsh/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In addition to regularly teaching classes, Maykut sells her taxidermy on <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/Hoardaculture\">Etsy</a> and sources taxidermy props for film shoots and trendy stores as window dressing and home decor. While Maykut has taxidermied birds, a boar head, squirrels and countless other creatures, her main focus is mice posed with props. She usually sells a minimum of two of her elaborately posed mice a week on Etsy for around $150 each. Some of the most popular are wedding mice, taxidermied mice that have been dressed to look like a bride and groom. She also collaborates with a professional puppet maker who helps create the tiny props and outfits, like the mouse replica of the English heavy metal band <a href=\"http://www.venomslegions.com/\">Venom</a> that the two are working on for a custom order.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Before I did taxidermy I was pinning butterflies, that was the gateway drug for taxidermy for me</p> <footer> <cite>Amber Maykut</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>All of Maykut\u2019s taxidermy mentors and teachers are older men who have showrooms in rural parts of the country. When she first started learning the craft from them, she worried they would think it was strange that a young woman from the city with no interest in hunting wanted to learn how to taxidermy. Instead, they were \u201cpsyched just to have anybody coming there wanting to seriously learn\u201d, she says. </p> <p>The taxidermy community recognized that it needs to change with the times and has been receptive to change. Maykut was invited to join the board of New Jersey\u2019s Garden State Taxidermists Association, where she has been pushing ideas around using social media to reach a new audience and moving taxidermy competitions from rural areas to places with a bigger and more diverse audience. She sees her classes as another way to introduce the craft to more people and foster other budding taxidermists.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3627d5e4b25053bba3cedb5530564289b5b0a334\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3627d5e4b25053bba3cedb5530564289b5b0a334/0_28_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amber Maykut says her mice classes are a way to frame taxidermy as something cute and whimsical, not something related to hunting, she explains.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amber Maykut says her mice classes are a way to frame taxidermy as something cute and whimsical, not something related to hunting, she explains.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Welsh/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These days, in New York City alone, in addition to Maykut\u2019s classes, Atlas Obscura offers regular taxidermy classes with another young woman taxidermist, <a href=\"http://afterlifeanatomy.com/\">Katie Innamorato</a>, who comes from an art background. <a href=\"http://morbidanatomymuseum.org/\">The Morbid Anatomy Museum</a> offers its own version with its taxidermists in residence, <a href=\"http://d-i-v-y-a.com/\">Divya Anantharaman</a>, who teaches classes on topics like how to taxidermy a chicken or make wearable taxidermy for fashion.<br></p> <p>Like the teachers, most of the students in Maykut\u2019s classes are women. Taxidermy classes fit into the DIY movement, she says, and is another craft that people can learn when they get sick of sitting in a cubicle at work, one that has become a popular part of home decor for its kitsch value. Her mice classes are a way to frame taxidermy as something cute and whimsical, not something related to hunting, she explains.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0147cf02fdca353e90fe1311afa28cfe3af81d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0147cf02fdca353e90fe1311afa28cfe3af81d9/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taxidermy on the walls of Amber Maykut\u2019s apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taxidermy on the walls of Amber Maykut\u2019s apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Welsh/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In addition to its embrace of whimsy, an emphasis on never killing for the sake of taxidermy has set the new generation of taxidermists apart and shifted the types of animals that are taxidermied. Finding already dead animals for her work has led Maykut to the pet shop mice doomed to be snake food, furrier auctions, where she picks up the heads fashion designers don\u2019t want, butcher remains of animals like quail, rabbits, deer and ducks as well as pest control companies that kill raccoons or other small mammals. Maykut sees her work as an homage to the animal, a way to \u201cgive them a second life, life after death\u201d.<br></p> <p>While the new iteration of the age old craft is more humane, a strong stomach for death is still required. Maykut grew up in an industrial part of New Jersey, without any exposure to dead animals but she does recall her interest starting early, when she would collect dead butterflies as a child that she found around a lilac bush. \u201cI would covet them and go hide them in my bedroom under my bed growing up. It was pretty and I would just look at it. So I would start hoarding these dead insects secretly,\u201d she tells me. That childhood habit let her to learning how to preserve the butterflies. \u201cBefore I did taxidermy I was pinning butterflies, that was the gateway drug for taxidermy for me,\u201d she says with a laugh.<br></p> <p>Back at the class the students are finishing up their mice with props provided by Maykut. \u201cCan it be a goth mouse?\u201d one student asks. Another student contemplates a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Van_Helsing\">Van Helsing</a> mouse but settles on making the mouse a nun instead. A bible and cross prove to be popular props, as do a set of tiny vinyl records and bottles of wine. After miniature top hats and other props, evaluated for their cool factor have been hot glued to the student\u2019s creations, Maykut walks around with a syringe full of embalming fluid to inject into the heads of the mice, complementing the students on their work and providing tiny tweaks to their morbid masterpieces.</p>",
  "<p>Leading Conservative Eurosceptics have formed a new lobby group to push for a hard Brexit, including leaving the European single market and ending free movement.</p> <p>The campaign, Leave Means Leave, could provoke fresh unrest on the Tory backbenches for Theresa May, pushing her government to take a no compromise approach to negotiations with the EU.</p> <p>Leading Tory MPs form the political advisory board, including those pushed out of government by the prime minister such as the former justice minister Dominic Raab. Others include the former environment secretary Owen Paterson, Sir Gerald Howarth, the former defence minister, and the outspoken Eurosceptic Peter Bone.</p> <p>The property tycoon Richard Tice will chair the group, which has set up headquarters in Westminster. In a report published on Sunday it says Britain must \u201cleave the world\u2019s least successful economic zone \u2013 the single market\u201d.</p> <p>The group recommends that if no deal can be done the UK should leave the EU without a trade deal and rely on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules while free trade deals are negotiated with other countries.</p> <p>The Labour donor John Mills, who spearheaded the Labour Leave campaign, is listed as a supporter of the group.<br></p> <p>Tice said: \u201cOn 23 June  the British people made it clear that they wanted to leave the EU. There should be no compromise on this. The sooner we leave the more certainty and confidence for everyone. It should be a maximum of two years post serving article 50.</p> <p> \u201cNon-EU countries will know when we can sign trade deals and the EU will know we are serious. Also consumers and businesses can draw confidence that we are a globally focused strong economy. Let\u2019s be clear: no deal is better than a bad deal.\u201d </p> <p>In its launch report, the group says remaining in the single market is the \u201c\u2018no say, low growth, regulatory burden, sovereignty illusion\u2019 option locking in perpetual trade deficits\u201d.</p> <p>The report warns that remaining in the single market \u201cwill continue to pull our political and economic focus towards the world\u2019s least successful economic zone while tying us down with needless and expensive regulation for all businesses, even if they do not export\u201d.</p> <p> May has so far refused to reveal the government\u2019s position on remaining in the single market, though the Brexit secretary, David Davis, told the House of Commons last week it was a \u201csimple truth is that if a requirement of membership is giving up control of our borders, I think that makes it very improbable\u201d.</p> <p>A senior Downing Street official sought to distance May from the statement, saying: \u201cHe is setting out his view that [single market membership] is improbable.\u201d</p> <p>WTO rules would mean high tariffs on key British exports, including a 10% tariff on car exports, 12% on clothing and 40% on lamb.</p> <p>The former education secretary Nicky Morgan said the rise of campaign groups such as Leave Means Leave was a result of a lack of information provided by ministers on the particulars of a Brexit deal.<br><br>Appearing on ITV\u2019s Peston on Sunday show, Morgan criticised the \u201ctightly controlled\u201d messaging coming out of Downing Street.<br><br>\u201cIt is time to flesh out some of the issues, especially Brexit,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cIf you leave a vacuum, other people will fill it. The time is now to say this is what we want to get out of Brexit.\u201d<br></p> <p>The Tory MP Anna Soubry, speaking on behalf of Open Britain, the successor to Stronger In, said the leave campaigners who wanted to exit the EU without a trade deal were \u201cthe biggest threat our economy faces\u201d.</p> <p> \u201cThis would mean new tariffs on nine out of 10 goods we sell to the EU, including 10% on cars,\u201d she said. \u201cThis would decimate our national industries and cost jobs. Working people will hope No 10 rejects this approach and instead seeks membership of the single market, which is vital for jobs and growth.\u201d</p> <p>The Ukip donor Arron Banks is expected to launch a grassroots pressure group to push for a hard Brexit, inspired by Momentum, the Labour-supporting movement that backs Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. </p> <p>Nigel Farage, the former leader of Ukip, said Momentum was a key inspiration. \u201cI think that is exactly what Arron Banks is going to do,\u201d he told BBC1\u2019s Andrew Marr show. \u201cHe built this movement, Leave.EU, which has a million online supporters. That\u2019s exactly what he intends to do. </p> <p>\u201cThere are some big examples of this \u2013 the Five Star movement in Italy is a completely online political party and it\u2019s now at 30% in the polls. There is a new kind of politics out there that could be very effective.\u201d</p> <p>Farage hinted he saw his future in grassroots organising and in his remaining tenure as an MEP rather than \u201cmeddling\u201d with the party\u2019s new leadership. \u201cI am going to go on as an MEP, I lead a group at the European parliament so I am going to go on with my helpful contributions there,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cBut we have a new leader, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/ukip-elects-diane-james-as-new-party-leader\">Diane James</a>, and I\u2019m going to let her get on with it. I am not going to meddle at all.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Adam Smith is blunt and to the point when I call him to suggest an interview. I want to talk to him about the Real Junk Food Project, which he founded, and suggest doing it at the cafe he set up in Leeds which uses waste food and operates on a pay-as-you-feel basis. \u201cWhich cafe? There are 30 of them. And that\u2019s just in Leeds.\u201d</p> <p>Bluntness may well be Smith\u2019s defining characteristic. A chef by training, who had, by his own admission, a troubled childhood, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcwCt_8pXb4&amp;index=7&amp;list=PLsRNoUx8w3rOiW1BA3J6zAeo9JhOO6E_s\">he set up the project only three years ago</a>, and it\u2019s been a roller-coaster ride since then. He reels off some statistics. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a 6,000-square-foot warehouse just here in Leeds and we\u2019re intercepting between two and 10 tons of food a day. It\u2019s just gone crazy. There are 125 Real Junk Food cafes worldwide now, not just in Britain, but in Israel and Australia and we\u2019re about to launch 16 of them in America.\u201d</p> <p>And, no, he doesn\u2019t have time to do an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s really not about me,\u201d he says. \u201cI haven\u2019t even met half the people who\u2019ve set up the cafes. It\u2019s much bigger than me now.\u201d It is pretty big, it\u2019s true, but I go up to Leeds anyway and, in the warehouse, it becomes more obvious why the project has taken off so dramatically. There\u2019s a mountain of food. Marks &amp; Spencer cakes and Ferrero Rocher chocolates and punnets of grapes and tomatoes and posh crisps and jars of olives and out-of-date bottles of that well-known easily perishable food substance \u2013 water \u2013 and down one aisle, dozens of clear plastic bin liners all filled with bread.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the bane of our lives, bread,\u201d says Keith Annal, the operations manager. \u201cThe supermarkets make so much of it. And then they chuck out so much of it.\u201d</p> <p>There are rolls and baguettes and bagels and croissants. There\u2019s poppy seed bread and granary bread and ciabatta and sliced white. They try to give away as much of it as they can but it\u2019s a challenge. Annal points to the van outside. \u201cI\u2019ve filled that twice already today. I got 22 boxes of fruit and veg from Morrisons \u2013 that\u2019s just three days\u2019 waste from one supermarket.\u201d</p> <p>And it\u2019s all perfectly good food, which if they hadn\u2019t rescued it would now be rotting at the bottom of the bin. \u201cLook at those bananas,\u201d says Annal. \u201cNothing wrong with them.\u201d But then there doesn\u2019t seem to be much wrong with any of it, apart from the fact that it\u2019s packaged, and everything in a package has either a \u201cuse by\u201d or a \u201cbest before\u201d date.</p> <p>It\u2019s certainly eye-opening seeing how much is coming out of a handful of supermarkets in one mid-sized British city. Leeds is just the start. The beginning, Smith hopes, of a global movement: to end food waste. Because, at the moment, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/22/uk-tops-chart-of-eu-food-waste\">we throw away 15 million tonnes of food a year</a>, more than any other country in the EU, even those, like Germany, which have a bigger population than us.</p> <p>Smith\u2019s response has been to invent the concept of a Real Junk Food cafe. Send off for a welcome pack, sign an agreement and then feed people waste food. The only rules are that you must feed everyone, not just poor people, and customers should only pay what they feel the meal is worth. If they have no money, they can volunteer labour and skills instead. Because the project has done deals with certain supermarket chains \u2013 Sainsbury, Morrisons, Ocado \u2013 at a national level, the food is there, ready for the taking.</p> <p>At the back of the warehouse scanning the shelves for produce is Duncan Milwain. He\u2019s the partner in a law firm but got involved when he received an email from Smith asking for legal help setting up the company. He did that but then found himself being drawn in. \u201cWhen I began to see the volume of waste coming in, I just thought it was obvious that something had to be done.\u201d</p> <p>Two years ago, Milwain gave up a day a week at his job and opened the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/apr/18/cafe-pay-what-you-want-intercepted-ingredients\">Saltaire Canteen</a>, a Real Junk Food cafe in the upmarket town of Saltaire, a world heritage site and home to one of the largest collections of David Hockneys in the world. \u201cSome people were convinced we should be feeding the poor, not serving cake in the posh part of town, but it\u2019s about food waste, not poverty per se.\u201d</p> <p>Though there is poverty too. I hop in the van with Annal and boxes of cakes and bags of potatoes and loaves of bread and head off to Parklands Primary School in Seacroft. It\u2019s one of the most deprived parts of Leeds and it\u2019s been one of the first schools to sign up to a new initiative the Real Junk Food Project is pioneering called Fuel for School.</p> <p>First, there\u2019s what the headteacher, Chris Dyson, calls \u201cFunday Friday!\u201d, or a lively assembly involving karaoke-ing along to Take That and a fiendishly difficult times table competition. There are stars and certificates for the children and then, at the end, they and their families file out and there are five tables laden with food, free for anyone to take, in exchange for a small donation if they have it and nothing if they don\u2019t. It has the rather grand title of a \u201cfood boutique\u201d but it\u2019s making use of food that would otherwise go in the bin.</p> <p>\u201cWe love it,\u201d says Dyson. \u201cSome parents were a bit proud at first but now they\u2019re piling in. We never shut. We come in, in the holidays, to do this. There are families for whom it\u2019s a continuous struggle. They get access to food banks but that\u2019s only three times a year. It\u2019s brilliant to be able to provide a bit extra.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"354d250b661c9feed7c40016fc19e4388c0f541e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/354d250b661c9feed7c40016fc19e4388c0f541e/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pupils from Richmond Hill Primary School, Leeds, with their headmaster Nathan Atkinson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pupils from Richmond Hill Primary School, Leeds, with their headmaster Nathan Atkinson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Floyd/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Richmond Hill Primary, in another deprived bit of Leeds, is just a few miles away. Its head, Nathan Atkinson, took over in 2014 and, while he says it\u2019s \u201can amazing place\u201d with pupils speaking 48 languages, nothing he tried seemed to be working. I\u2019ve followed him from Seacroft, where he took part in the assembly, to Wigan, where he\u2019s speaking to a room full of headteachers. \u201cI\u2019d been in vulnerable schools, schools in special measures,\u201d he tells them, \u201cbut when we tried the same things here, they didn\u2019t work. We had good teachers, a good curriculum, but we realised the children weren\u2019t in a place where they were ready to learn.</p> <p>\u201cIt came to a head after one half-term, their behaviour was just atrocious, and we realised some of them hadn\u2019t had a hot meal in a week.\u201d The first thing he did was to buy toasters for every classroom, \u201cbut then I needed food. I\u2019d met Adam by chance and I said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you open a junk food cafe in the school?\u2019 He was like, \u2018No thanks. But you can do it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Richmond Hill, he explains, is a \u201cfood desert\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s impossible to buy fresh fruit and veg in the postcode. But half a mile away, it turned out was one of Leeds biggest wholesalers. \u201cWe jumped in the school minibus and straightaway they gave us 27 boxes of bananas and ten boxes of cucumbers.\u201d</p> <p>The school now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/15/hungry-pupils-breakfast-teachers-survey\">provides breakfast</a> every day to 650 pupils, has its own cafe and a weekly \u201cfood boutique\u201d. It has improved punctuality and attendance and helped build bonds between the parents and the school, he says. To showcase what was possible, he and the Real Junk Food Project fed 10,000 children across Leeds on one day last autumn, entirely with waste food. \u201cWe want to make food available to children,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s so simple. Yet it\u2019s tragic that we have to do this.\u201d</p> <p>The teachers in the room nod their heads thoughtfully. They\u2019ve been invited by Ann Fairhurst and Shirley Southworth, who\u2019d heard of Smith\u2019s success and decided to set up their own Real Junk Food cafe in Wigan. It\u2019s called Fur Clemt \u2013 Wigan-ish for \u201cI\u2019m starving\u201d \u2013 and when a friend of theirs told them about children going into school hungry, they decided to set up a Fuel for School too.</p> <p>They\u2019re another incredibly dynamic duo. They both have full-time jobs but set up the cafe in a community centre owned by the Wigan Warriors rugby league team and have become expert at sourcing fresh food from suppliers in the local area. The Real Junk Food Project has been supportive, but they\u2019ve largely done it themselves. As have Save the Date in Dalston, east London, Curb Kitchen in Southampton, the Trash Cafe Network in Gosport \u2026 the list goes on.</p> <p>In one afternoon, I\u2019ve met half a dozen inspiring people who have taken Smith\u2019s idea and run with it. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to know what drives people but for some reason a mountain of perfectly good food that\u2019s destined to end up rotting seems to have done the trick.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47e69f5761879b50cbec426a158a9269707b79e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47e69f5761879b50cbec426a158a9269707b79e4/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Customers at the Saltaire Canteen, Saltaire, Yorkshire, one of the many Real Junk Food cafes nationwide.

It\u2019s a handsome Victorian model village and the cafe has big plate glass windows, discreet branding in shades of grey, scrubbed pine tables and a small notice explaining the pay-as-you-feel concept. I\u2019ve just missed lunch but I chat to Katie and Michael Tonks from Sheffield who are polishing off their croque monsieur, salad and what they describe as \u201cposh chips\u201d.</p> <p>How was it? \u201cDelicious. I\u2019m impressed. I\u2019m always getting confused by the difference between \u2018use by\u2019 dates and \u2018best before\u2019 and I sometimes worry if I\u2019ve got something in the fridge that\u2019s a few days out of date.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m here because, after a month or so of phone calls, texts and emails, I\u2019ve finally pinned down Smith. He turns up with his young son, Joshua, and the words that no interviewer who\u2019s travelled 200 miles wants to hear, \u201cI\u2019ve only got 15 minutes.\u201d He softens up when we actually start talking but it\u2019s calling a spade a spade that has probably got him as far as he has. There\u2019s no doubting his anger for what he considers \u201ccriminal levels of waste\u201d and, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2014/mar/27/cafe-food-past-sell-by-date-video\">though it was a video on the <em>Guardian</em> website</a> that gave the Real Junk Food Project its first proper blast of publicity, he\u2019s reluctant to do anything that might be construed as courting the press. He declined to be photographed for this piece.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s just so much going on. I\u2019m totally overwhelmed. I said right from the beginning that I wanted to feed the world and I haven\u2019t even started yet. We\u2019ve fed nearly half a million people in 30 months but there\u2019s so much more we can do.\u201d But the pace of growth has been exhausting. \u201cI\u2019ve just got off the phone with people in the South Korean government, because we\u2019re launching there. I get emails all the time from all over the world. Yesterday, in the space of about three minutes, we had emails from Indonesia, Spain, Canada, and Loughborough. It\u2019s non-stop.\u201d</p> <p>Why has it captured people\u2019s imaginations?</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing complex about it. It makes sense. It\u2019s sustainable. And it\u2019s the right thing to do. I think that\u2019s why people get inspired. It\u2019s something they can do. If some kid from Leeds can do it, they can. I\u2019ve been in prison, I was in care, I\u2019ve been in mental health homes. I was on drugs and alcohol. I was found nearly dead in a car from a suicide attempt.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about empowering people to change their own lives and when you do that, that\u2019s when a movement happens, and in the space of two years we\u2019ve had thousands of people around the world standing up and doing stuff.\u201d</p> <p>The idea came to him while he was working as a chef in Australia. He\u2019d worked his way up to head chef, on a big salary, in Melbourne, working all hours. And then, to extend his visa, he\u2019d gone to work for a few months on a farm. \u201cIt was February 27, 2013 and I\u2019d just seen the farmer get a delivery of a tonne of courgettes, freshly picked, that he was feeding to his pigs. I said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you just give this to charity?\u2019 And he said, \u2018I just don\u2019t have the cost and logistics to get it where it needs to go.\u2019 That\u2019s when it came to me.\u201d</p> <p>He returned to the UK, set up the first cafe in Armley, Leeds, often going skip-diving outside supermarkets to get ingredients, and for the first two and a half years, during which time his son was born, he didn\u2019t even take a wage. He was living off \u00a392-a-week tax credits. And, though he\u2019s persuaded many of the supermarkets to work with him, he\u2019s still angry about what he sees them doing: the waste that seems to be built into the system.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sick to death of the media and supermarkets who say it\u2019s all to do with consumers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/18/tesco-supermarket-food-waste\">It\u2019s nothing to do with them</a>. We didn\u2019t want this saturation of supermarkets on our high street selling food 24 hours day, manipulating us into purchasing more.\u201d</p> <p>France has recently introduced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/04/french-law-forbids-food-waste-by-supermarkets\">a law that bans supermarkets</a> from destroying unsold food. They have to give it to charity, or face a fine. It\u2019s a prime example of the kind of thing Smith believes ought to be introduced here but is bound up in exasperating bureaucracy.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fed up being invited to Westminster and wasting my time with people who are creating targets for 20 years\u2019 time. It needs to happen now, on a local level. I think a lot of it is about grassroots education. There\u2019s a huge demographic of people who are completely uneducated about food.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Joshua has picked up an old-looking satsuma from the window display and put it in his mouth. There\u2019s no \u2018Joshua! Joshua! Put it down,\u2019 from Smith though. \u201cAre you going to eat the skin as well?\u201d he asks him. Joshua starts eating the skin. \u201cOK, well, your choice.

  "<p>\u2018Chatbots are the new apps,\u201d said Microsoft\u2019s CEO Satya Nadella earlier this year. He was not the first senior tech exec to make this claim.</p> <p>\u201cThreads are the new apps,\u201d suggested Facebook\u2019s head of messaging products David Marcus in January, referring to the threads of conversation in apps such as Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp.</p> <p>Nadella and Marcus see chatbots \u2013 computer programs that you interact with by \u201cchatting\u201d, for example in threads in messaging apps \u2013 as an important new human/machine interface. Both of their companies have launched tools to help developers create these bots, and between April and September, more than 30,000 were made for Facebook Messenger alone.</p> <p>Chatbots aren\u2019t a new technology. The shopping and breaking news bots in Messenger\u2019s ancestors are chatbots such as AI psychotherapist Eliza from the mid-1960s and Parry, a bot mimicking a human with paranoid schizophrenia, in the early 1970s.</p> <p>(In 1972, <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc439\" title=\"\">they were thrown together for a bot-to-bot conversation</a>, which Parry quickly steered down a rabbit hole of corrupt horse racing gambling.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think the developers need to spend a lot more time focusing on the personality and psychology of their bots</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Since 1991, the chatbot equivalent of the Olympics has been the annual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/25/artificial-intelligence-loebner-prize\" title=\"\">Loebner prize</a>, which challenges bots to converse with responses indistinguishable from a human\u2019s. Questions in 2016 included: \u201cWhat does Brexit mean?\u201d; \u201cWould you like a cup of tea?\u201d; \u201cWhat do you know about the Turing test?\u201d; and \u2013 a neat touch \u2013 \u201cDo you dream of electric sheep?\u201d</p> <p>But the chatbots on Facebook Messenger and other apps such as <a href=\"https://www.kik.com/\" title=\"\">Kik</a>, <a href=\"https://telegram.org/\" title=\"\">Telegram</a>, <a href=\"https://slack.com/\" title=\"\">Slack</a> and <a href=\"http://wechat.en.uptodown.com/android\" title=\"\">WeChat</a> aren\u2019t dreaming of electric sheep. Rather than trying to pass for human, they\u2019re unashamedly artificial, and focused entirely on providing information and/or completing tasks for the humans they interact with. If they have views on Brexit, they\u2019re not letting on.</p> <p>Talking to these chatbots works just like messaging a friend, once you\u2019ve added them as a contact. Kik has its own \u201c<a href=\"https://bots.kik.com/#/\" title=\"\">bot shop</a>\u201d to browse bots in categories including entertainment, lifestyle and games, while business messaging app Slack has a \u201c<a href=\"https://slack.com/apps/category/At0EFT6813-brilliant-bots\" title=\"\">brilliant bots</a>\u201d list for its corporate users.</p> <p>Expectations of these bots are high, and immediate. As veteran developer and Twitter hashtag inventor Chris Messina wrote in his blog in January: \u201c2016 will be the year of conversational commerce \u2026 you and I will be talking to brands and companies over Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, and elsewhere before year\u2019s end, and will find it <em>normal</em>.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI\u2019m less interested in whether a conversational service is provided by a human, bot, or some combination thereof\u2026 Over an increasing period of time, computer-driven bots will become more human-feeling, to the point where the user can\u2019t detect the difference, and will interact with either human agent or computer bot in roughly the same interaction paradigm.\u201d</p> <p>This vision \u2013 text chatting to brands and companies as well as to friends and family \u2013 is what\u2019s driving the chatbot excitement in 2016.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m excited about conversation as an interface, because for certain applications it feels like the most natural way to engage with a product or service,\u201d says Danny Freed, founder of a startup called Joy whose chatbot helps people to track their moods.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eaa5e0a642c7ad18e68dc5424d15eff8488e4943\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eaa5e0a642c7ad18e68dc5424d15eff8488e4943/0_0_1000_1000/1000.png\" alt=\"Chatbot Jarvis, developed by Lawrence Wu, which acts as a reminder service for its users\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chatbot Jarvis, developed by Lawrence Wu, which acts as a reminder service for its users.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: www.hellojarvis.ie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It may also be accessible to a wider range of people. Pete Trainor is director of human-centred design at <a href=\"http://www.nexus.cx/\" title=\"\">Nexus</a>, a digital agency that created an AI assistant called Luvo for the bank RBS. He is enthusiastic about chatbots reaching people who may struggle with other digital products.</p> <p>\u201cJust in terms of engaging audiences who can\u2019t handle complex user experiences, they\u2019re absolutely brilliant,\u201d he says. \u201cMy mum won\u2019t use apps or websites, but she does text message and use WhatsApp to keep in touch because it\u2019s conversational and thus very human by design.\u201d</p> <p>A similar argument is made by Nitin&#xa0;Babel, co-founder of Indian startup Niki, whose chatbot can book taxis, pay bills and order takeaway food among other tasks. He points out that in India, less than 2% of its billion-plus mobile users are transacting online, yet there are more than 10 times more users of messaging apps&#xa0;there.</p> <p>\u201cA similar trend exists globally. Chatbots have the potential to bridge this gap and enable users who are currently on the mobile internet just to converse with their friends and family to start utilising the platform for a much wider range of services,\u201d says&#xa0;Babel.</p> <p>One of the key services will be customer service. Tony Wright, strategist at marketing and technology agency <a href=\"http://www.digitaslbi.com/uk/\" title=\"\">DigitasLBi</a>, points out that even if chatbots can handle simple interactions between businesses and their customers, they will have an impact. \u201cWaiting hours on the end of a line to give your energy supplier a meter reading could one day be as simple as tapping a few numbers into a tab within Facebook Messenger,\u201d he&#xa0;says.</p> <p>Jo Allison, consumer behavioural analyst at research firm <a href=\"http://www.canvas8.com/\" title=\"\">Canvas8</a>, which has published several reports on chatbots, agrees.</p> <p>\u201cThe potential chatbots have to improve customer service is exciting because it\u2019s very real,\u201d says Allison, who sees the technology as an alternative to the \u201calmost universally unpopular\u201d interactive voice response (IVR) technology used by many companies\u2019 customer service operations now.</p> <p>Chatbots may be a logical next step, meanwhile, for companies that already have humans talking to customers on social networks such as Twitter \u2013 from rail companies to travel firms and consumer goods makers \u2013 but who may struggle to deal with an influx of questions and&#xa0;complaints.</p> <p>Allison cites a recent study suggesting that almost 90% of messages for brands on social networks are ignored, while replies to the other 10% come after an average wait of 10 hours. \u201cConsumers expect a reply within four,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7475bccd99310f061c95e7726720bf9dd89b22a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7475bccd99310f061c95e7726720bf9dd89b22a/0_0_533_752/354.jpg\" alt=\"Joy, which helps people to track their moods\" width=\"354\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joy, which helps people to track their moods.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: http://www.hellojoy.ai/</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chatbots, backed by machine-learning technology, will be able to remember past conversations and learn from new ones, building up a stash of data over time to respond to a greater range of incoming queries.</p> <p>Technology firm IPsoft has built an \u201cAI worker\u201d called <a href=\"http://www.ipsoft.com/amelia/\" title=\"\">Amelia</a> that is designed to automate customer services. Enfield council in London has already struck a deal to use \u201cher\u201d to help residents find information and complete the initial steps in standard applications such as planning&#xa0;permission.</p> <p>\u201cShe determines how to resolve a problem based on knowledge of the topic and process involved,\u201d says IPsoft\u2019s European CEO Frank Lansink. \u201cIf Amelia cannot answer a question, she will alert a human colleague, observe the following interaction and learn how to respond to comparable questions in the future.\u201d</p> <p>While people involved in developing chatbots stress the positive aspects of this, it does raise two concerns. First: the privacy aspects of collecting, analysing and using all this data. Chatbots will need clear privacy policies just like apps do, but will the chatty mode of interaction distract us from&#xa0;that?</p> <p>\u201cA number of existing bots \u2013 and bot platforms \u2013 are not designed with user privacy and security in mind,\u201d says Alan Duric, CTO of Skype rival Wire. \u201cRather than users having to check to make sure that adequate precautions are inbuilt, security is a requirement that should be considered a mandatory part of&#xa0;design.\u201d</p> <p>Second, there\u2019s the impact on the humans currently working in customer service. In the shorter term, as Lansink\u2019s comments indicate, those \u201chuman colleagues\u201d will still be essential. Further out, chatbots are part of the wider discussion about how software may displace humans in the 21st-century workplace.</p> <p>Some companies see chatbots as helping us get more done in our own jobs. Business messaging service Slack, for example, has its built-in \u201cSlackbot\u201d and a range of bots being developed by third parties.</p> <p>\u201cBots are becoming part of our everyday working lives. We see bots scheduling meetings, helping salespeople access CRM information, managing to-dos, reporting on key business metrics and more,\u201d says Slack\u2019s head of developer relations, Amir Shevat.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Don\u2019t build a chatbot just to follow a trend; build a chatbot if it helps you solve a problem better</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of focus on consumer bots right now, but bots that solve for work will be where the real success will happen, because there\u2019s a clear set of problems to address.\u201d</p> <p>This is a time of experimentation for the technology: many of those 30,000-plus Facebook Messenger chatbots are awkward to interact with, spammy and/or not useful at all. It\u2019s hardly surprising at this stage, but it should be a warning against grand claims of a chatbot revolution.</p> <p>\u201cIt got really overhyped really quickly,\u201d admitted David Marcus last week. \u201cThis is a long journey, and you have to start somewhere.\u201d</p> <p>Experts agree that an awareness of chatbots\u2019 weaknesses as well as their strengths is important. Rachel Barton of consulting firm Accenture Strategy, says: \u201cReceiving scripted conversations, being directed to self-service channels or automated help can feel frustrating in particular instances when customers need help and support.</p> <p>Dylan Bourguignon, CEO and founder of insurance startup So-Sure, says: \u201cMy take on chatbots is always: \u2018what do customers want?\u2019 My answer to that is: \u2018a quick, correct and complete answer to their question\u2019. Until AI is able to do that, humans are the best respondents.\u201d</p> <p>Pete Trainor says that Nexus spent nearly six months working on the personality of RBS\u2019s Luvo assistant before coding any tech, to minimise the risks of frustration on the part of the humans it chats to. \u201cI think the developers need to spend a lot more time focusing on the personality and psychology of their bots,\u201d he says. \u201cWe wanted to ensure the profile was right and the language was approachable. Implementation is relatively straightforward: it\u2019s the words in the chats and the sentiment analysis of the conversations \u2013 there\u2019s where the real magic lives.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/06/what-is-chat-bot-kik-bot-shop-messaging-platform\">What is a chat bot, and should I be using one?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lawrence Wu, developer of a chatbot called Jarvis, which acts as a reminder service for its users, also uses the \u201cmagic\u201d word, but suggests that it comes from the combination of bots and humans behind the scenes. \u201cThe most exciting thing about chatbots, as a medium, is allowing humans to step in when needed,\u201d he says. \u201cChatbots in themselves aren\u2019t revolutionary \u2013 we\u2019ve had phone trees and robotic dialogues for a while \u2013 but when paired with human intelligence for tasks AI hasn\u2019t quite gotten to yet, these bots seem like magic.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes the combination of humans and bots can be toxic, as Microsoft found out earlier this year when it launched a chatbot called Tay on Twitter. Designed to mimic the linguistic tics of a late teenage girl and learn from the humans it interacted with, Tay was manipulated by mischievous internet users, and managed to praise Hitler, deny the Holocaust and accuse George W Bush of the 9/11 attacks before being taken offline by Microsoft within a day of&#xa0;launching.</p> <p>Your energy company\u2019s Facebook Messenger bot is unlikely to be as outrageous, but experts think Tay is a valuable reminder that there is more work to do around AI and chatbots.</p> <p>\u201cAI-driven programs have huge potential so long as they can get better at understanding language contextually,\u201d says Jo Allison of Canvas8. \u201cAnd learn to avoid being tricked into promoting genocide.\u201d</p> <p>Other experts warn of the risks of getting carried away with the chatbot hype. \u201cNot all services can be shoehorned into a chat-based dialogue,\u201d says Tim Rea, CEO of messaging app Palringo, which has a number of bots.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes a conversation is just not the best interface suited for the task,\u201d says Lawrence Wu of Jarvis.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t build a chatbot just to follow a trend; build a chatbot if it helps you solve a problem better, or get to market faster,\u201d adds Joy\u2019s Danny Freed.</p> <p>Developers are enthusiastic about how the current generation of text-based chatbots will evolve. Voice-based technologies such as Apple\u2019s Siri and Amazon\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/21/amazon-echo-alexa-home-robot-privacy-cloud\" title=\"\">Alexa </a>\u2013 soon to make its UK debut in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2014/nov/09/amazon-echo-smart-tv-watching-listening-surveillance\" title=\"\">Echo</a> speaker \u2013 show one path forward.</p> <p>\u201cRight now, the interface for chatbots is text and buttons. Eventually it will be voice, like with Amazon Alexa or Siri,\u201d says Syd Lawrence of <a href=\"http://wemakeawesomesh.it/\" title=\"\">We Make Awesome Sh</a>, the studio that recently created a <a href=\"http://wemakeawesomesh.it/hardwellbot.html\" title=\"\">Facebook Messenger chatbot for musician Hardwell</a>. \u201cIt will be like having a virtual PA helping them with all parts of their life.\u201d</p> <p>That said, \u201cit\u2019s important to remember that consumers want less, not more, interaction,\u201d says Daniel Hegarty, CEO of Habito, which has just launched a chatbot mortgage adviser in the UK. \u201cIf Alexa can order my shopping while I shout it out across the kitchen, that\u2019s great, but the second it takes longer to say than to type, the utility is destroyed.\u201d</p> <p>Tony Wright thinks that chatbots will also appear in digital services beyond messaging apps. \u201cIt could be interesting to see how chatbots might be built into the likes of Netflix and Spotify,\u201d he says, suggesting that bots could build on the current recommendation features these services have.</p> <p>\u201cYou might want to quickly establish who directed something or what else a particular actor\u2019s been in,\u201d he says, before delivering a warning that chatbots must not be gimmicks.</p> <p>\u201cThe likelihood of a chatbot becoming popular depends on how entertaining or useful it is. Does it really serve a purpose or enhance someone\u2019s experience?\u201d says Wright, before making a comparison that may give Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella pause for thought.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why the personified paperclip in the corner of Microsoft Office isn\u2019t around any&#xa0;more.\u201d</p> <h2>Our pick of the chatbots</h2> <h2><a href=\"https://blogs.bing.com/search/2014/09/05/meet-xiaoice-cortanas-little-sister/\" title=\"\"><strong>XiaoIce</strong></a><strong> </strong></h2> <p>Tay may have been led astray by humans (see main article), but Microsoft has another chatbot that has been less problematic.

After one of his deputies broke a woman\u2019s neck by crashing his vehicle into her car, Clarke was alleged to have <a href=\"http://fox6now.com/2014/07/13/false-accusation-leads-to-lawsuit-for-county-sheriff/\">overseen an attempted cover-up</a> that involved framing the woman for drunk driving.</p> <p> </p> <p>The victim, Tanya Weyker, sued Clarke, several deputies and county authorities in state and federal court in 2014 for compensation and civil rights violations. She said Clarke and his officers continued pursuing charges against her for months even after they knew video evidence showed the officer was at fault. </p> <p>\u201cClarke was personally involved in the conspiracy to continue with the baseless prosecution of [Weyker],\u201d the federal lawsuit said, \u201cor, at the very least, was deliberately and recklessly indifferent to his subordinates\u2019 unconstitutional actions and related misconduct.\u201d Clarke and the officers denied the allegations. </p> <p>An attorney for Weyker, Drew DeVinney, said Weyker settled her state lawsuit for the state-capped maximum $250,000 in compensation, and then settled the federal lawsuit for more than $95,000 for civil rights violations and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p> <p>Clarke has also come under criticism from within his own ranks. In 2010, deputy Richard Graber, a senior official in the Milwaukee deputies\u2019 union, alleged that Clarke aggressively confronted him, called him a \u201csick fuck\u201d and threatened to \u201ccome after him\u201d for questioning an order that deputies must work mandatory overtime after the high-profile death of a local child.</p> <p>\u201cClarke\u2019s profanity-ridden rant included yelling, pointing, and calling Graber \u2018waste,\u2019 an \u2018organizational terrorist,\u2019 a \u2018fucker,\u2019 and a \u2018cancer to the agency\u2019,\u201d according to an appeals court filing. Clarke denied most of Graber\u2019s account of their confrontation. A federal appeals court said Clarke\u2019s behavior amounted to an \u201cadverse employment action\u201d but rejected an allegation from Graber that the mistreatment was because of his union activity.</p> <p>Inspector Edward Bailey, a spokesman for Clarke, declined to comment. \u201cThis county office does not involve itself in the current presidential race in any capacity,\u201d he said in an email.</p> <h2><strong>Joe Arpaio</strong></h2> <p>Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, has over the past two decades become notorious as <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/03/sheriff-joe-arpaio-the-most-lawless-lawman-in-america/359613/\">\u201cthe most unrepentantly lawless lawman in America\u201d</a>: repeatedly condemned by the courts, denounced by civil liberties advocates and forced to pay out tens of millions of taxpayer dollars in compensation.</p> <p>Arpaio currently faces possible criminal charges for contempt of court for ignoring a judge\u2019s order in 2011 that his aggressive immigration patrols must stop racially profiling suspects. Earlier this year, Arpaio was <a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2016/05/13/arpaio-contempt-federal-court-ruling/77833232/\">held in civil contempt on three counts</a> by a federal judge. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3e173b7cd1dbdcb72ecb86e405faa9cf7eed639a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e173b7cd1dbdcb72ecb86e405faa9cf7eed639a/1366_58_1480_1849/800.jpg\" alt=\"Arpaio.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arpaio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ross D Franklin/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Less well known than Arpaio\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.12news.com/news/local/arizona/inmates-endure-extreme-heat-in-tent-city/250951997\">\u201cTent City\u201d</a> detention center, however, is his record of using his department to go after personal and political enemies. In 2013, the cofounders of the Phoenix New Times newspaper, which had been investigating questionable real estate deals by Arpaio, were <a href=\"http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/joe-arpaio-loses-new-times-co-founders-win-375-million-settlement-for-2007-false-arrests-6651491\">awarded $3.75m in damages</a> after Arpaio\u2019s men arrested them on false charges in late-night raids on their homes.</p> <p>In 2008, Arpaio had local judges and county legislators indicted on trumped-up criminal corruption charges that later collapsed entirely, resulting in yet more million-dollar payouts to those targeted. The failed charges also prompted the state supreme court to disbar the county attorney, an Arpaio ally, who was found to have brought malicious prosecutions against political foes.</p> <p>Last year it emerged that Arpaio had even <a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2015/04/23/joe-arpaio-apologizes-contempt-hearing-day-three-abrk/26240715/\">hired a private investigator to look into the wife</a> of the federal judge who ruled in 2013 that Arpaio was engaged in illegal racial profiling. Spokespeople for Arpaio did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <h2><strong>Tim Howard</strong></h2> <p>Sheriff Tim Howard of Erie County, New York, is a co-chairman of Trump\u2019s campaign in the Republican nominee\u2019s home state, which Trump has declared he can win even while trailing Hillary Clinton in state polls <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ny/new_york_trump_vs_clinton-5792.html\">by an average of 19 percentage points</a>.</p> <p>Despite holding an official position in the Republican\u2019s campaign, Howard earlier this year was involved in policing a Trump campaign rally in Buffalo, where he was filmed overseeing the removal of protesters. Aides to the sheriff denied that he had a conflict of interest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e24a5b98bc9a9a59da4c422d66937fcacf65c886\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e24a5b98bc9a9a59da4c422d66937fcacf65c886/142_31_523_654/400.jpg\" alt=\"Howard.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Howard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: timhoward.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Howard, 66, has endured rocky patchesin the upstate county \u2013 not least on three separate occasions when prisoners escaped or were mistakenly released from his jail. Two of them went on to commit serious crimes before recapture. </p> <p>In April 2006, Ralph \u201cBucky\u201d Phillips escaped from Alden prison. He killed a state trooper and wounded two others before being caught after five months on the run. In March 2009, Rasheed Milton was released from the same facility by mistake. Milton was recaptured after raping a woman. Then, in March 2012, Awet Gebreyesus was mistakenly released from Alden after being indicted for the attempted murder of his partner. Gebreyesus was caught before harming anyone.</p> <p> Howard has also been <a href=\"http://wnymedia.net/2013/10/howard-widens-pay-play-net-8-years/\">accused of cronyism</a> after it emerged that companies that gave Howard\u2019s election campaign tens of thousands of dollars in contributions received hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of county contracts for purchases such as <a href=\"http://wnymedia.net/2005/09/sheriff-howard-bought-like-new-car/\">new police cars</a>, software and furniture.</p> <p>Howard\u2019s spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <h2><strong>Paul Babeu</strong></h2> <p>Sheriff Paul Babeu of Pinal County, Arizona, enthusiastically supports Trump\u2019s anti-immigration stance and campaign pledge to build a wall along the US border with Mexico. Babeu is also running as a Republican for a seat in the US House of Representatives and has made border security a key plank of his campaign.</p> <p>Babeu promises voters on his website that he will tackle the \u201chundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants pouring across our southern borders\u201d, warning that at present, \u201cpossible terrorists with military training, deliberate plans and lots of money can cross the border\u201d.</p> <p>In 2012, Jose Orozco, a Mexican man and ex-boyfriend of Babeu who worked for the sheriff\u2019s election campaign, alleged that he was threatened with deportation by an aide to Babeu when he refused to sign an agreement not to publicly disclose the relationship. Orozco\u2019s attorney said she was told Orozco\u2019s US visa had expired, making him undocumented. Babeu denied Orozco\u2019s allegations. An inquiry by the Arizona attorney general<a href=\"http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/sheriff-paul-babeu-pleaded-with-ex-boyfriend-to-keep-silent-about-relationship-ags-investigators-reveal-6641494\"> concluded</a> that he committed no criminal violation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"576a373f7f5dccd0648751ce44501cc5eac6ac58\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/576a373f7f5dccd0648751ce44501cc5eac6ac58/1091_371_1053_1317/800.jpg\" alt=\"Babeu.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Babeu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Lott/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Babeu has also faced <a href=\"http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/sheriff-paul-babeu-on-defensive-again-denies-sisters-claims-he-had-sexual-relationship-with-17-year-old-boy-from-boarding-school-he-once-ran-6643099\">allegations made public by his sister </a>that as headmaster and executive director of a boarding school for troubled teenagers in Massachusetts, he had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old student. Babeu, who led the controversial DeSisto School in West Stockbridge between 1999 and 2001, responded by <a href=\"http://tucson.com/news/blogs/senor-reporter/babeu-camp-attacks-sister-over-new-allegations/article_398e3692-622f-11e1-a591-0019bb2963f4.html\">publishing his sister\u2019s mental health history</a>. </p> <p>The former student, Joshua Geyer, <a href=\"http://tucson.com/news/blogs/senor-reporter/babeu-camp-attacks-sister-over-new-allegations-updated/article_398e3692-622f-11e1-a591-0019bb2963f4.html\">has not disputed</a> that he had a relationship with Babeu, but insisted that it was not \u201cinappropriate\u201d. This week, a spokesman for Babeu sent the Guardian a letter purportedly from Geyer that said he and Babeu had no sexual relationship at all. Asked twice whether Babeu himself denied that the relationship took place, the spokesman did not respond.</p> <p>State authorities <a href=\"http://media.phoenixnewtimes.com/7687064.0.PDF\">pursued DeSisto</a> for operating illegally without a state license. Over the years, the school <a href=\"http://www.bridges4kids.org/articles/2004/3-04/Globe2-23-04.html\">became notorious</a> for its severe punishment system, and was investigated repeatedly for allegations of abuse and mistreatment of students. It has since closed. </p> <p>The Babeu spokesman, Barrett Marson, said in an email: \u201cPaul was in charge of the business operations at the school. He never had any control over student discipline or instruction. He was in charge of ensuring there was food and bathroom supplies and things like that. But Paul was never investigated nor had any knowledge of any alleged abuse at the school while he was employed there.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Wayne Ivey</strong></h2> <p>Sheriff Wayne Ivey of Brevard County, Florida, is playing an energetic part in Trump\u2019s campaign. Earlier this month, he appeared at the opening of a Trump campaign office in Cocoa Beach with Caldara, the campaign pilot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"89d4ef2fa6289e212e768e96025a2926e2a3ed7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89d4ef2fa6289e212e768e96025a2926e2a3ed7c/1_0_480_600/400.jpg\" alt=\"Ivey.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ivey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brevard County sheriff's office</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI believe we need a leader that is going to stand shoulder to shoulder with those people that protect our great nation,\u201d Ivey told supporters, \u201cthose men and women in uniform that protect our communities.\u201d</p> <p>Five years ago, Ivey retired as an agent with the Florida department of law enforcement (FDLE) three days after he was accused by a local <a href=\"http://volusiaexposed.com/fdle/ivey/phonecall.pdf\">muckraking website</a> of making a threatening telephone call to a female probation officer who was the ex-fiancee of Ivey\u2019s son, Robert. </p> <p>A brief review by FDLE of the allegation said that no complaint had been made by the female officer, and that because Ivey was no longer employed by FDLE, the case was out of the department\u2019s hands.</p> <p>A spokesman for Ivey did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <h2><strong>Scott Jones</strong></h2> <p>Sheriff Scott Jones of Sacramento County, California, pledged earlier this year to support Trump. But Jones, who is also running for Congress as a Republican, has dialed down his enthusiasm after the Republican nominee\u2019s recent string of inflammatory remarks.</p> <p>\u201cHe has not personally or publicly endorsed any candidate, but has said he will cast his ballot for Trump given the only alternative is Hillary Clinton,\u201d Dave Gilliard, a spokesman for Jones, said in an email.</p> <p>Jones was accused of sexually harassing a junior female deputy starting when he was a sergeant about 12 years ago, which he denies. The deputy, Tosca Olives, said in a sworn deposition that Jones frequently harassed her on visits to the department\u2019s law library, to which she was assigned. Jones denied the allegations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a94a3d595fcd3b8166735047b2b6c87ef8951950\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a94a3d595fcd3b8166735047b2b6c87ef8951950/757_448_1225_1531/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jones.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jones.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: scottjonesforcongress.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt started with, like, rubbing my shoulders while I was on the phone,\u201d said Olives. \u201cIt progressed to going underneath my shirt and feeling my breasts. There would be times when there would be kissing. There were times that he would unzip my pants and \u2026 but mainly feeling my breasts and kissing.\u201d </p> <p>She said Jones touched her inappropriately \u201capproximately 30\u201d times. Once, when she told him he must stop touching her breasts, she alleged, Jones replied: \u201cStop being so tempting.\u201d Olives said she feared retaliation for taking action against Jones, and that when she eventually told him she was going to make a complaint about him, he advised her not to and suggested she would ruin both their careers. </p> <p>Olives\u2019s testimony was submitted as evidence in a lawsuit brought by four other female deputies, who alleged retaliation and discrimination by the sheriff\u2019s department \u2013 much of it in a county jail, when it was run by Jones. Jurors ruled in favor of the female deputies and awarded them $3.6m. </p> <p>In an emailed statement, Jones said the allegations against him were \u201cwithout merit, corroboration or evidence\u201d and that he denied them \u201cin the strongest possible terms.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cI have never been the subject of any internal complaint of misconduct of any kind during my 27-year career with the sheriff\u2019s department, and have consistently opened up my personnel records for review,\u201d said Jones.</p>",

  "<p>I had been a massive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/nick-cave\">Nick Cave</a> fan since I was a student in Australia. Seeing him live in 2004, when I was about 18, changed the course of my life. It blew my mind how powerful and visceral he was on stage with the whole band, and especially with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Ellis_%28musician%29\">Warren Ellis</a>. I\u2019d never seen such commitment to performance that wasn\u2019t contrived. It felt so natural, like they were really expressing the aggression and emotion in the music. I\u2019d been playing in bands since I was 14, but that concert inspired me.</p> <p>Later I moved to the US and joined <a href=\"http://warpaintwarpaint.com/\">Warpaint</a> as their drummer, we were asked to support Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds for a number of dates on their 2014 tour. Although I was nervous and thrilled, I promised myself that if I met him, I wouldn\u2019t go and talk to him. It was a pact I\u2019d made with myself when we\u2019d played a festival on the same stage as another of my idols, a rock icon from the same era. I\u2019d said to him: \u201cGreat show, I love your stuff,\u201d but he was an absolute c-word to me. I was disappointed because it felt like he had gone out of his way to be grumpy. I didn\u2019t want to find out that Nick Cave was like that, too.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Before each show, the band would make fresh juice with a juicer Nick had in his room</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The first gig of the tour was in Denver, and I arrived a little earlier than my bandmates to set up and see Nick and his band do their sound check. By the time they\u2019d finished, I was hiding downstairs in our dressing room, with our tour manager, determined not to look like a fan-girl. But then I heard Nick in his loafers walking down the stairs to check if anyone was down there. He came in and introduced himself. \u201cOh, you\u2019re the drummer, the Australian one. I\u2019ve heard about you,\u201d he said, which completely broke the ice. There was no mystique. I realised he was just an Australian guy, like people I knew at home, in a band, who really cares about what he does.</p> <p>Nick might be known as the Prince of Darkness, but I was surprised and relieved at how sweet and talkative he was, and Warren, too. It made me realise that if a musical legend is at ease with their own talent, they can be warm and friendly, whereas those who struggle with their level of fame and feel pressured to live up to people\u2019s expectations can be spikier.</p> <p>We played six or seven shows together, but there wasn\u2019t a party atmosphere on the tour. Quite the opposite, in fact. Those guys have been through every single imaginable experience with every single substance, so before and after each show, they\u2019d just make fresh juice with a juicer Nick had in his room. I made him one once. I can\u2019t remember what was in it, but we both agreed it wasn\u2019t very nice \u2013 it tasted like sweet dirt.</p> <p>One night, on stage, I spotted Nick\u2019s unmistakable silhouette watching us in the crowd. And after the last show in LA, even though he probably knew a lot of people there, he took the time to thank us for playing with him. He turned to me and said: \u201cYou\u2019re a wonderful drummer,\u201d and I replied: \u201cYou\u2019re a wonderful human being.\u201d And I meant it \u2013 he really is. He has so much integrity, even though he\u2019s been around so long. It made me think it\u2019s possible not to be jaded and to commit to something for life.</p> <p><em>Warpaint\u2019s new album Heads Up is out on 23 September via Rough Trade Records </em><br></p>",
  "<p>I first realised I was living next door to a weekend sublet two years ago. Late one Saturday night I heard boys yelling and loud music, and the thumping against the walls was so hard one of my picture frames fell off and cracked on the floor. I presumed the neighbours had a teenager who was throwing a cheeky party while their parents were away. When it happened again the following weekend I assumed it was a repeat. However, a few weekends later it was girls yelling, playing what I recognised to be the true hymn of the hen party, You Can Leave Your Hat On. Suddenly it made sense: I was living next door to a sublet playing host to hen parties and stag dos most weekends.</p> <p>I\u2019ve had men wrestling on the floor outside my flat, someone trying to kick in my door, and fights that have left blood smears across the corridor walls. I\u2019d refrained from complaining to the building manager or letting agents and tried to deal with the host directly.</p> <p>I had nothing against someone trying to make a little extra cash over the weekend. It was when it became clear the property was being entirely used for short-term rentals, and after my second phone call to the police, that I started complaining. I complained to the building manager, to my landlord, to the council. So far, nothing has been done.</p> <p>Weekend sublets such as those offered on <a href=\"http://www.airbnb.co.uk/\">Airbnb</a> and <a href=\"http://www.booking.com/\">Booking.com</a> have revolutionised holidays. But I\u2019m not the only person to have a bad experience. Paul, a teacher with a flat in Edinburgh, noticed people trundling by his apartment with luggage. Then he was kept awake by late-night noise. \u201cThe irritation was that it was very difficult to get in touch with the owner via the Airbnb website. I had to pretend to be interested in renting it in order to send them a message,\u201d he says, and he claims that \u201cthe problems have left people in negative equity\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Residents alleged that the Airbnb host had breached several terms in his lease agreement, and the tribunal judge agreed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If you want to hear a real Airbnb horror story, how about the one involving the riot police who were called to a flat in Brixton, south London, after 150 people arrived for a party that turned into chaos? In that case, reported in the Times in May, residents had apparently called the police on several occasions to break up parties in the flat, which had been let through the website. One complained that a partygoer \u201clanded with a crash on to his balcony from above\u201d and knocked on his window to get back in.</p> <p>In the First-Tier Tribunal (Property Chamber), which handles disputes over property and land, the residents alleged that the Airbnb host had breached several terms in his lease agreement, and the tribunal judge agreed, saying the defendant appeared to be using the property as a guesthouse. It\u2019s the first known ruling against an Airbnb host by the tribunal \u2013 but probably won\u2019t be the last.</p> <p>Plenty more alarming tales can be found on <a href=\"http://www.airbnbhell.com/\">AirbnbHell.com</a>, a website \u201cdedicated to helping hosts and guests share their stories about the risks and dangers of using Airbnb\u201d.</p> <p>Cal King, shows editor at TV channel Comedy Central, rents a flat in London next door to one that is empty quite a lot of the time, \u201cand then each weekend a different group of raucous people turn up and have parties\u201d.

If this does not work, she suggests you gather as much evidence as possible. \u201cKeep a diary of events, record the frequency of the lettings, and the dates and times of the nuisance.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2216ac225eba2dc88c86a18be964f26e4ba9dde\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2216ac225eba2dc88c86a18be964f26e4ba9dde/0_202_6016_3612/1000.jpg\" alt=\"airbnb\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The legal avenues available to resolve disputes will depend on whether the property is leasehold or freehold.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Macdougall/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The legal avenues available, should it come to this, will depend on whether the property is leasehold or freehold. For leasehold properties, owners or tenants will have to report the issue to the freeholder of the block, who will be the people able to take action.</p> <p>In terms of longer nuisance sublets, local authorities may offer protection. For example, in London, stays longer than 90 days require previous planning permission.</p> <p>If you are selling your property, things become a little tricky. You are required to complete a property information form disclosing any disputes or complaints about the properties or properties nearby. If you have been in a dispute about an Airbnb letting and you do not inform the buyer, you could be liable in court for misrepresentation and potentially be asked to pay damages to the buyer. In an extreme situation the sale will not go through.</p> <p>Airbnb now has well over 1m properties and is active in 200 countries. One of the key features of the website is the review function: guests can review the properties they have stayed in, and hosts can review their guests.

However, it is not clear if anyone has yet been banned. Airbnb says just one in 18,000 UK guest arrivals has prompted a complaint via the tool.</p> <p>\u201cThe overwhelming majority of Airbnb hosts and guests are good neighbours and respectful travellers,\u201d the company says. \u201cWe want to do everything we can to help our community members be good neighbours.\u201d</p> <p>In a recent blog, it pledged to treat each case seriously. \u201cHosting is a big responsibility,\u201d it said, \u201cand those who repeatedly fail to meet our standards and expectations will be subject to suspension or removal from the Airbnb community.\u201d</p> <h2>The cities cracking down on Airbnb<br></h2> <p>The idea of Airbnb and other short-term lets as an alternative to over-priced hotels may soon be over, <em>writes Patrick Collinson</em>. Many cities have begun to introduce new rules, after residents complained about being overwhelmed by weekend visitors banging wheelie bags up stairs, breaching building security rules, and loud parties. Pressure has also come from hotel groups and local politicians who have lost revenue from hotel taxes. </p> <p><strong>Berlin</strong><br>In June, a court upheld Berlin\u2019s de facto ban on short-term rentals. People who let more than 50% of their apartment on a short-term basis without a permit risk a fine of \u20ac100,000 (\u00a385,000). City authorities were concerned that the availability of affordable housing was being severely threatened by the rise of short-term letting. Munich and Hamburg have also taken steps to curb <br>short-term lets. </p> <p><strong>San Francisco </strong><br>The city that is home to Airbnb\u2019s HQ is also one of its fiercest opponents. Hosts have to register with the authorities; if Airbnb advertises an un\u00adregistered property it can be fined $1,000 (\u00a3755) a day for each listing. An action group in the city has posted \u201cwanted\u201d flyers. The crime? \u201cAirbnb\u2019ing our community\u201d and \u201cdestroying affordable housing for immigrant, minority, and low income families\u201d. <br></p> <p><strong>New York</strong> <br>The city\u2019s rental laws ban apartments in buildings with three or more units from being rented out for less than 30 days. Landlords who flout the ban can be fined as much as $7,500. But home \u00adsharing \u2013 where the host is \u00adpresent \u2013 is legal. Critics say that short-term rental companies like Airbnb are \u00adflooding the city\u2019s housing \u00admarket, reducing available housing stock citywide by 10%, \u00adaccording to a study released in June. <br></p> <p><strong>Barcelona</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ca17518f67a6ead3c680c855818d6b1e16cc792\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ca17518f67a6ead3c680c855818d6b1e16cc792/0_399_5928_3558/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barcelona is popular for Airbnb.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barcelona is popular for Airbnb rentals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: kiko_jimenez/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Catalan city has been among the most aggressive in fighting Airbnb, \u00adslapping a \u20ac30,000 fine on the site for hosting illegal tourist lets in 2014.

  "<p>Robert Harris\u2019s gripping new novel, <em>Conclave</em>, has a contemporary setting, in the sense that the year is 2016, or thereabouts. But in another way, it\u2019s not contemporary at all. The action takes place over 72 hours inside the Vatican, where the cardinals are sequestered to elect a new pope in a secretive process that dates from the 13th century. In charge of their various ballots \u2013 again and again they must vote, the idea being that with each round, one candidate grows ever stronger until, well, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habemus_Papam\"><em>habemus papam</em></a> \u2013 is Lomeli, the dean of the College of Cardinals. Lomeli is a good and holy man, but he is suffering a crisis of faith, finding it hard to pray, a situation that is hardly helped by the revelations that now begin to unspool around him and threaten to derail the election altogether. Who will win? Only God knows. At first, it is a three-horse race between Cardinal Adeyemi, whose victory would make him the first African pope; Cardinal Tredesco, a seething, outspoken Italian with traditional views; and Cardinal Tremblay, an ambitious but bland Canadian. But then, from nowhere, new candidates emerge, one of whom is, much to his horror, Cardinal Lomeli.</p> <p>As it happens, <em>Conclave</em>\u2019s author has a somewhat pontifical air himself, and I mean this in the best sense of that word, because he is about the least pompous famous writer I\u2019ve ever met. Amiable, wise and pink-cheeked, with the same taste for the finer things we have witnessed in certain popes \u2013 let us remember <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2013/mar/03/pope-benedict-true-legacy-fashion-sense\">Benedict\u2019s red leather loafers</a> \u2013 it\u2019s all but impossible, once you\u2019ve read his new novel, not to imagine how fabulous he would look in a white <a href=\"http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2016/04/28/popes-zucchetto-sold-for-12500-in-50-per-cent-price-drop/\">zucchetto</a>, with a cape to match, and a socking great ring on his finger for journalists to kiss as they try desperately not to reveal the sin of envy in his presence (before he was a million-selling novelist, Harris was a hack just like them \u2013 and me). Not that he is a Catholic, or even a believer. \u201cThough I\u2019d be careful about mocking God,\u201d he says, when we meet for lunch at a Bloomsbury hotel close to where he is attending a workshop for a possible theatre adaptation of one of his books (he has steak and chips, and three glasses of wine). \u201cHe is quite a character in the book, because I knew from the start that these cardinals would believe in God as we believe in electricity. But really, I just love politics in all its forms, and this is the oldest election in the world, and the most mysterious. I\u2019ve been intrigued by it for years.\u201d</p> <p>His research for the book began with the Gospels, which he read again, very fast, for the first time in 40 years. \u201cThey unfold like a novel, and such a character emerges: a radical, quite tricky and contradictory figure, but still, a human being. It is a religion founded on love and charity, and my cardinals genuinely try to lead that life. But what fascinates me are the inevitable distortions and corruptions of the institution. You go in attempting to be good, but of course you soon lose sight of yourself, because no one monitors themselves constantly. And then there comes the enormous wealth, the architectural beauty, the privilege, and the whole thing starts to buckle.\u201d The Vatican, he says, was surprisingly helpful, responding positively to his request \u2013 sent via his Italian publisher \u2013 for a private tour of the city. This enabled him to see the places he describes so vividly in his book: the Casa Santa Marta, the hall of residence-like building, staffed by nuns, where the cardinals bunk down during the conclave; the Pauline Chapel, with its two frescoes by Michelangelo, where they attend a sermon before withdrawing to the Sistine Chapel to vote; and the Sacristy, where the new pope is robed. Is the Casa Santa Marta as strange as it sounds in <em>Conclave</em>? \u201cIt does have a slightly weird atmosphere, yes. I spoke to one person who\u2019d stayed there, who checked after a night because it felt too much like a private clinic.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Unless the old electoral college is reintroduced, I think the Labour party is gone and we just have to accept that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As the world waits for white smoke to rise above the Vatican, the cardinals must know nothing of what is happening elsewhere. They are sealed off entirely. In <em>Conclave</em>, however, the outside world does permeate their holy seclusion. Lomeli, without giving too much away, has no choice but to consider both radical Islam, and the question of the ordination of women, even as the cardinals do their work. Does Harris think his novel will prove controversial, at least with some Catholics? \u201cI don\u2019t know. I do think the church is resolving its contradictions at the moment thanks to the personality of a remarkable pope. But there are greater difficulties ahead. Its attitude towards the ordination of women isn\u2019t, I think, sustainable \u2013 and the rise of Islam highlights those anomalies in the Catholic church by mirroring them, to a degree.\u201d For Harris, the persecution of Christians in the Middle East is also \u201cone of the great untold stories\u201d, for which reason, he made a central character in <em>Conclave</em> the archbishop of Baghdad: \u201cBefore Blair and Bush, there were 1.5 million Christians living relatively safely in Iraq. Now we\u2019re down to 250,000, living in a state of siege.\u201d</p> <p><em>Conclave</em>, Harris\u2019s 11th novel, wasn\u2019t an easy book to write, but it was a fairly fast one. It took just seven months. \u201cWhen I was younger, there would be long gaps between books: three years, five years. But after <em>Pompeii</em> [which came out in 2003] something changed, and now I really like to be starting work on a new book before the last one is out. I\u2019m at my most contented when I am writing. But it also distances me from the publication of the one that\u2019s coming out.\u201d It isn\u2019t the reviews that he dislikes, so much as the whole business of publication. \u201cJust as people who go blind are said to have more acute hearing, so I think that if, over 25 years, you become a writer, the aspect of privacy and living in your own head becomes very developed. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m shy or retiring. It\u2019s just that I like the equanimity of living in my own zone.\u201d He is suspicious of literary festivals, for all that he can pull in the crowds. \u201cIt works against you. They see you, and so they don\u2019t buy the book. And with fiction, I don\u2019t really know why you would necessarily want to hear the voice of the novelist; it gets in the way. It\u2019s quite important that the voice in the reader\u2019s head is neutral. One of the great strokes of luck for Orwell is that no recording of his high-pitched Etonian voice exists, and so this incredibly clear, modern, classless voice comes through in his writing.\u201d His own voice is not neutral. Reassuringly (to me, at any rate), he still sounds like he comes from Nottinghamshire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f747336d87aee13075339704c2ce1dd169c9bac0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f747336d87aee13075339704c2ce1dd169c9bac0/0_15_3192_1916/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miranda Richardson and Rutger Hauer in the 1994 film version of Fatherland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miranda Richardson and Rutger Hauer in the 1994 film version of Fatherland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto/Allstar/MGM</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But we should talk about politics, shouldn\u2019t we, before we get to his roots? <em>Conclave</em> might well be set in a realm even more bitchy and anachronistic than that of the Palace of Westminster, but with its unbudging binaries \u2013 the cardinals are either liberal or not \u2013 and its talk of schism, not to mention the role pride and envy play in proceedings, it brings to mind nothing so much as Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party, which, as all the world knows, is shortly to announce the result of its very own election.</p> <p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d he says, pretending to throw his head into his hands (Harris, a former political editor of the <em>Observer</em>, has made no secret <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robert___harris\">on social media</a> and elsewhere of his opposition to Corbyn). \u201cOne is having to revise one\u2019s views. I basically think, now, that MPs should elect the leader [of the Labour party] just as the cardinals elect the pope. I started to think it after Ed Miliband won. Everything that has gone wrong with British politics this year \u2013 and an awful lot has gone wrong \u2013 has been to do with getting away from parliamentary democracy. There has always been an admirable tension between the demands of the wider electorate and their representatives, [with] their conscience and judgment, and from between the two comes something valuable. This throwing of things glibly open to one member, one vote is a disaster. It\u2019s true of the referendum, and it\u2019s true of the Labour electoral system.\u201d</p> <p>His smile is wry. \u201cIn my old age, I find I\u2019m a Burkeian conservative, a believer in the power of institutions. It\u2019s counterintuitive that widening the franchise can be harmful for democracy, but I think it can be. One should not try to mix two different systems. That\u2019s the moral of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/18/dictator-robert-harris-review-cicero-remarkable\">my Cicero novels</a>. Mess around with your constitution, and it will fall to pieces. So now we arrive at a situation where the government and the political establishment is struggling to put through the most colossal about-turn for 70 years, an about-turn in which it does not really believe; and where Labour MPs know that their leader is not up to it, that he can\u2019t form a government or even hold one to account, but are being dictated to by outside forces. It will end in tears.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When history is written, Blair will be seen to have played a large part in what has happened to Labour</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>How should the parliamentary Labour party respond to Corbyn\u2019s inevitable victory? \u201cI don\u2019t think, in the foreseeable future, there\u2019s any way of removing him \u2013 and if he were to be followed by John McDonnell [the shadow chancellor], Corbyn might, in any case, look like the golden era. I saw an interview with McDonnell the other day in which he was asked: what are the four writers who have influenced you most? And he said: Marx, Lenin, Trotsky, and Rosa Luxemburg. You couldn\u2019t make it up, could you?\u201d He hoots with derisive laughter. \u201cNo, unless the old electoral college is reintroduced [under that system, individual members represented a third of votes, the same as the PLP and&#xa0;the unions], I think the party is gone and we just have to accept that. My view \u2013 although I know none of them want to confront it because it\u2019s such an emotionally shattering trauma&#xa0;\u2013 is that there is a case for the&#xa0;PLP to elect its own leader, and form its own shadow cabinet. The point is that they [the Corbynites] don\u2019t play by rules the rest of us would recognise. They genuinely believe purity is the most important thing. Well, that\u2019s fine. But go and start your own party, don\u2019t take over one of the great instruments for social progress in this country. It\u2019s immoral.\u201d</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p>On Twitter, Harris has occasionally mentioned his background when debating these matters. \u201cCouncil- house-born. Comprehensive school-educated. Voted Foot, Kinnock. But not for private-school apologists for IRA and Stalin,\u201d he said, when Seumas Milne was appointed the party\u2019s communications director almost a year ago. This isn\u2019t, however, just another manifestation of the competitive prole-ier than thou speak that trails so many opinions in our media \u2013 by which I mean that it\u2019s not even remotely an effort to disguise or distract from his current privilege. The point is: Harris thinks of himself as having been, from childhood, deeply lucky. \u201cI was fortunate to have been born into working-class family where books were valued and you were the centre of your parents\u2019 lives. There was never any doubt that you were important. I\u2019ve been so blessed. I left university before they got rid of grants, I left Cambridge before <a href=\"http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/blf10/links/structuralism.html\">structuralism</a> took over, I left the BBC before John Birt took over, I left Fleet Street before that all collapsed, and I started writing novels before the supermarkets took over.

He read Greene, Lawrence, Joyce, and he did it all on his own dime. The last conversation I ever had with him was about <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hitler-Stalin-Parallel-Alan-Bullock/dp/0006863744\">Alan Bullock\u2019s joint life of Hitler and Stalin</a>, which I\u2019d given him. He\u2019d read every page of it. He left school at 14, but he had a rich intellectual life.\u201d</p> <p>Harris\u2019s parents would take him and his sister to museums, and encouraged them to watch interesting documentaries on TV, but there was no pressure, no hothousing. \u201cYou see so many people who have been broken by their expectations having been forced on them.\u201d His background was a bond he shared with Roy Jenkins, with whom he enjoyed a \u201cgreat, late friendship\u2026 Roy\u2019s father was a miner who had gone to Ruskin College [in Oxford; it specialises in adult education]. He\u2019d done six months in Paris before the first war, and he had this row of classics \u2013 Zola, Balzac \u2013 and they were all in French.\u201d</p> <p>Harris took to Cambridge (where he read English) \u201cimmediately\u201d, a response he traced back to his time at comprehensive school. \u201cI was like Sergeant Bilko. I mean I had my own office, with a phone, and there wasn\u2019t a school council, so I set one up and made sure I was head of it, and I did a school paper. It was bizarre! <em>Rushmore</em> [a comedy by Wes Anderson about an eccentric teenager] is one of my favourite films \u2013 because the boy in <em>Rushmore</em> was me!\u201d So Cambridge, land of the swot and the, erm, weirdo, was perfect? \u201cYes. I loved it. My first Saturday, I went to the student newspaper [he ended up editing it], and I got involved with the union, and before I was even 20 I had met all these cabinet ministers and John le Carr\u00e9.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3dfaf9acf2ce4920d5b67c1d9c19ce517b9b713e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dfaf9acf2ce4920d5b67c1d9c19ce517b9b713e/0_172_4256_2555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pierce Brosnan as Blair-ish former prime minister Adam Lang in Roman Polanski\u2019s film adaption of Robert Harris\u2019s The Ghost.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pierce Brosnan as Blair-ish former prime minister Adam Lang in Roman Polanski\u2019s film adaption of Robert Harris\u2019s The Ghost.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Snap Stills/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After university, he didn\u2019t fancy going back to the provinces, which meant that, thanks to Fleet Street union rules, his only option was to join the BBC (he\u2019d known from the age of eight that he wanted to write). This, then, he duly did, working as a reporter on <em>Newsnight</em> and <em>Panorama</em>. \u201cBut by 28 or 29, I\u2019d got as far as I was going to go. I was never going to be a presenter. So when I was asked if I would be interested in being political editor of the <em>Observer</em>, well, I knew that it was going to be tough, but at that age, you have enough guts to do it.\u201d Later on, having resigned in protest at a long-forgotten office coup too complicated to go into here, Andrew Neil, then the editor of the <em>Sunday Times</em>, rang him and offered him more money than he was earning at the <em>Observer</em> full time to write a column one day a week. Things like that, I tell him, possibly a bit sullenly, just don\u2019t happen any more. \u201cOh, I know,\u201d he says soothingly. \u201cI have children going out into the world.\u201d (He is married to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2013/may/19/gill-hornby-hive-interview\">Gill Hornby</a>, sister of Nick, and now a novelist herself; they have four children.)</p> <p>Column writing was, he insists, the hardest job he has ever done, the deadline squatting over his week like a toad. As he tells it, he had to psych himself up like a prize fighter. But never mind, lightning was about to strike. On the days he wasn\u2019t trying to work up an opinion, he began writing a novel that asked the question: what if the Nazis had won the war? This became <em>Fatherland</em>, for which the hardback rights went for \u00a3500,000, and the paperback for more than \u00a31m. As a result, he was able to buy the swanky vicarage in a Berkshire village that he still lives in. He also has a house in the south of France, and drives an Aston Martin. In our current climate, there\u2019s something rather old-fashioned about this (JK Rowling and Paula Hawkins apart). It makes me think of Arnold Bennett, whose novels financed the purchasing of yachts, or Somerset Maugham, who retired to a villa in Cap Ferrat. And like both of them, he is a very good if perhaps underrated writer (by which I mean that it\u2019s easy for literary types to be snobbish about novels that read so smoothly), his imagination always turning outwards, where it fixes with apparent ease on some extraordinary new subject. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/17/robert-harris-fear-index-review\">The financial crisis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/30/fiction.features3\">ghost-writing</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/02/officer-spy-review-dreyfus-affair-robert-harris\">Dreyfus</a>: he has tackled them all.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/09/robert-harris-imperium-why-i-write-political-fiction\">Robert Harris: why I write political fiction</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s time he was going, though I must say he\u2019s looking rather comfortable on the hotel sofa by now. Before he does, though, I have to ask about Tony Blair, with whom he was once friendly \u2013 in 1997, Blair invited Harris to join him on the campaign trail \u2013 but with whom he later fell out after Blair sacked Harris\u2019s old friend Peter Mandelson for the second time. What, I wonder, did he make of Blair\u2019s response to the Chilcot inquiry, which took the form of a two-hour press conference? \u201cOddly enough, someone who sees him asked what I thought he should do, and I said, if I were him, I would call the press into a room and I\u2019d say \u2018ask me anything, and I won\u2019t leave until your questions are exhausted\u2019. I don\u2019t know if that was fed back to him or not.</p> <p>\u201cIn one sense, I\u2019m reluctant to talk about him \u2013 it looks like I\u2019m obsessed, and I\u2019m not. I liked Tony very much, and in many ways, even though I haven\u2019t seen him for a decade, I still do. But I think when passions have cooled and history is written, he will be seen to have played a large part in what has happened to Labour and the exit from Europe. A whole promising strand of political thought was sort of trashed and destroyed, not so much by the Iraq war, as by his subsequent behaviour. If he had said at any point, \u2018I did what I felt was right, but it has not proved to be wise, and I regret it,\u2019 he could have moved on from there. But when he says, after Chilcot, I still think it [the war] was the right decision\u2026 well, that\u2019s wrong, and then you think everything must have been wrong. It\u2019s like <a href=\"https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/a_p_herberts_misleading_cases/\"><em>AP Herbert\u2019s Misleading Cases</em></a><em>.</em>\u201d He puts on a pedantic funny voice: \u201cThat is the 13th chime of the clock, which renders suspect the 12 chimes that have gone before.\u201d</p> <p>In his eyes, however, the real disaster is that Iraq, and Blair\u2019s deluded attitude to it, has only encouraged the repudiation of Labour\u2019s years in government first by Ed Miliband, and then by Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 which brings us back to the church. \u201cLabour ought to be trumpeting its triumphs,\u201d he says. \u201cMy children go to the local state school, and it\u2019s fantastic; my mother-in-law has been in the local hospital and it\u2019s very good. Both were built under the watch of a Labour government. But now it\u2019s all trashed by their own side. One thing I learned from the Catholic church is that, as Cardinal Newman said in the 19th century, you can change all doctrine so long as it doesn\u2019t <em>contradict</em> anything that has gone before.\u201d Like a priest delivering the last line of a particularly interesting sermon, his tone is firm but pastoral, the last two words falling on the ears like a blessing. \u201cYou cannot have a situation in which a political party repudiates all that has happened before. You destroy the institution.

The theme and content of the museum is therefore personal. \u201cAs a young boy of my generation the African American story was also our story,\u201d says Adjaye, who was born as the civil rights movement was gathering force in 1966, \u201cin the sense that it was the techniques, the motivation, it was a way of being and it was a way of understanding that one could succeed in the modern world and not be oppressed by it. I feel it as part of my emerging into adulthood and being who I am.\u201d</p> <p>It is indeed the content that should come before the architecture of the building that serves it. It includes artefacts of desperation and sheer survival, such as the shards of tools used by Maroons \u2013 escaped slaves \u2013 in their refuge in the Great Dismal Swamp of North Carolina.

There is abundant film and photography of the struggles and grotesqueries of racial politics, such as the Ku Klux Klan march through Washington in 1925.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97fb3066809f1cad24263b7cae8aad2110f10f98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97fb3066809f1cad24263b7cae8aad2110f10f98/0_0_3500_2340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The patterns of the museum\u2019s filigree, bronze-finished screens derive from the decorative metalwork created by African American craftsmen in cities such as New Orleans and Charleston.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The patterns of the museum\u2019s filigree, bronze-finished screens derive from the decorative metalwork created by African American craftsmen in cities such as New Orleans and Charleston.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Scraps of intimacy and poverty are interspersed with larger structures, such as wooden cabins inhabited by slaves and a watchtower from Angola prison in Louisiana.

Eventually you find the P-Funk Mothership, a spoof spacecraft that used to land on stage on the 1970s stadium tours of George Clinton and his band Parliament-Funkadelic.</p> <p>The collection is remarkable for the fact that, little more than a decade ago, it didn\u2019t exist. Lonnie Bunch, on taking up his post in 2005, was armed with a Bush-signed act of Congress that supported the idea of the museum, but he had nothing to put in it. This could have been catastrophic, as the world is full of unconvincing museums founded on ideas but little content. So Bunch and his team toured the nation, inviting people to offer whatever they might have. The result is personal, eclectic, touching and surprising, rather than encyclopedic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"455288523531fb361d1586c6be06b5ccbbee7797\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/455288523531fb361d1586c6be06b5ccbbee7797/0_0_3000_1999/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The culture galleries at the Smithsonian Institute\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The culture galleries at the Smithsonian Institute\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The displays are sometimes overcrowded but avoid gimmicks and pointless gestures at interaction. They are text-heavy, partly to fill the gaps that arise from the nature of the collection, with a measured and sober tone. The exhibits are arranged in three main sections, starting with a narrative history, rising up from the bottom of a deep basement, that runs from the beginnings of the Atlantic slave trade in 15th-century Africa and Europe to the presidency of Barack Obama. On two upper floors, above the ground level entrance hall, are the community galleries, which talk about such things as religion, place, sport and military service, and the culture galleries, which show art, music, literature and performance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6ad1cfa21a43f4e0813f82d4acbe33b5eace11a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ad1cfa21a43f4e0813f82d4acbe33b5eace11a4/397_130_2428_2031/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Slave shackles on display at the museum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"836\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Slave shackles on display at the museum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The museum thus climbs from slave ships to the mothership, an ascendant trajectory that maybe doesn\u2019t do enough to avoid an oversimplified story of oppression ultimately redeemed by blues, funk and hip-hop. The museum nonetheless does an outstanding job of giving due weight to horrors and heroism, to people just living their lives and to the endless repeating stories of creativity prompted by oppression. Many of the histories are familiar even to non-Americans, such as that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/oct/25/guardianobituaries.usa\">Rosa Parks</a>, but they are shown here with new weight. You are assailed by the mental force of something pushing from the back of your mind to the front. Was segregation really so cruel, so laughably hypocritical, so absurdly rigged and transparently unfair? Yes, it was.</p> <p>The official story of the design is already much told and doubtless will be repeated to the museum\u2019s visitors for as long as it stands. The triple-decker superstructure of inverted truncated pyramids recalls the celebratory headpieces on certain Yoruba sculptures from west Africa and can also evoke, if you like, arms raised in celebration. They are made of bronze-finished aluminium whose filigree patterns derive from the decorative metalwork created by African American craftsmen in cities such as New Orleans and Charleston. A long, deep canopy that shelters the main entrance refers to the porches of southern houses that acted as social and political centres, little village halls, informal schools.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0e3475e1f955b40c48164de9928365ac2e81540d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e3475e1f955b40c48164de9928365ac2e81540d/0_0_2698_3600/749.jpg\" alt=\"Inside the National Museum of African American History and Culture.\" width=\"749\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside the National Museum of African American History and Culture.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Karchmer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These narratives are necessary, says Adjaye, for a project that was \u201cdefinitely not done quietly on a mountain somewhere on my own\u201d but had to \u201cnegotiate a lot of positions and opinions to get this form. So it was really important that this was neither cloaked nor hidden. It was something that had to be absolutely clear and people had to understand why.\u201d</p> <p>But such stories only get a building so far. They could describe an exhilarating work or a cringe-making one. What matters more are the relationships the architecture makes through its space and material between exhibits, people and surroundings.</p> <p>Here there are tensions between the institutional nature of a museum and its popular ambitions, between a search for authenticity and the tendency of modern museums to resemble shopping malls \u2013 shiny, escalatored \u2013 driven as they are by mall-like considerations of people moving and browsing. The design also has to deal with the contemporary habit of putting exhibitions in sealed boxes, where air and light are perfectly controlled, which makes for abrupt transitions with the rest of the world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It achieves its main, difficult task, which is to be both American and African American</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One technique that Adjaye tries is to create moments of crowd-pleasing charm \u2013 a particular tone of purplish pink terrazzo in the entrance hall\u2019s floor, coppery panels on the lifts, outbreaks of decoration as in an art deco cinema, something as simple as the rich blue over the entrance to the Oprah Winfrey theatre. There is an agile open loop of a spiral staircase going down to the basement, which also helps you forget that \u2013 because of restrictions on the above-ground volume of buildings on the National Mall \u2013 60% of the museum is buried. You might imagine something non-Caucasian in these hues and motifs, but at any rate they are different from the greys and creams of most Smithsonian museums.</p> <p>More substantially the building seeks to connect with its august surroundings, through views from decks outside the upper galleries that are sometimes filtered through the filigree screens and sometimes through openings specially oriented to particular monuments. The glass-walled ground floor allows views in all directions of both greenery and stone-pillared official architecture. At this point it feels embracing and inclusive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66b0450bbb04ba5f04a33b415648e2201ea290a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66b0450bbb04ba5f04a33b415648e2201ea290a7/0_0_4481_2987/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A first world war helmet of the US Army\u2019s 369th Infantry Regiment, known as the Harlem Hellfighters, on display at the museum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A first world war helmet of the US Army\u2019s 369th Infantry Regiment, known as the Harlem Hellfighters, on display at the museum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Preston Keres/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The hardest job the design has to do is to find a way to stand on its grand stage. It is placed at a corner where the grand axis emanating from the Capitol intersects at a right angle with that emanating from the White House, a cross pinned at its centre by the 555ft obelisk of the Washington monument. All around are white stone commemorations of white men, albeit often built with black labour. As a freestanding largely symmetrical object, the new museum has something in common with its neighbours, but as a dark-clad structure that eschews classical columns for apparently floating horizontal layers, it does not. Its suggestion of pyramids gives a geometrical echo of the obelisk (which, lest we forget, is Egyptian and therefore also African), but their inversion sets them apart.</p> <p>Adjaye doesn\u2019t mind if a link is made between the dark skin of the building and that of the people it remembers, but he gives another reason for it. If it is not the main material for buildings on the National Mall, bronze is nonetheless used for the memorial detail of statuary and plaques. The role of the new museum is itself partly memorial, the idea having started off a century ago with the primary intent of honouring black soldiers. The bronze finish, for Adjaye, is \u201cabsolutely from the classical family, but to express different ideas seemed like the right thing to do\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca59259401bdaf675eb3bcbf4b6df0fbf80b1414\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca59259401bdaf675eb3bcbf4b6df0fbf80b1414/0_469_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The National Museum of African American History and Culture flanked by the Washington monument, right.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The National Museum of African American History and Culture flanked by the Washington monument, right.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Karchmer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It takes some nerve to do a building like this, on this spot, and the design is confident enough to pull it off. It is not flawless, as it sometimes feels assembled or panellised more than crafted. The bronze-coloured screens are not the delicate, seamless things suggested in computer visualisations. The build-up of the exterior cladding \u2013 glass wall plus screen plus substantial fixings for the latter \u2013 impedes the sense of connection between inside and out. There are moments of gawkiness that can be engaging or uncomfortable, depending on your taste. But it achieves its main, difficult task, which is to be both American and African American, and to be of its location but also different from it.</p> <p>As a museum and as a building it enacts the tone that is so striking in the 1928 text \u2013 its patience, reason and lack of rancour. It realises qualities of America at its best, ones which, as is now abundantly clear, we can\u2019t take for granted.</p> <h2><br></h2> <h2>A century of waiting: the long campaign for the museum</h2> <p>The new National Museum of African American History and Culture is the result of more than a century of efforts to commemorate the contributions of African Americans to their country.</p> <p><strong>1915</strong> A group of civil war veterans, gathered to mark the 50th anniversary of its ending, organise a \u201ccommittee of colored citizens\u201d to build a monument.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5c959639ea78bb30518af9bf1f16b3ece7548584\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c959639ea78bb30518af9bf1f16b3ece7548584/0_0_1078_1066/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A badge showing the unbuilt 1920s design for what has now become the National Museum of African American History.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"989\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A badge showing the unbuilt 1920s design for what has now become the National Museum of African American History.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oliver Wainwright</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>1929 </strong>Congress permits a national commission to be set up, but it fails for lack of funding.</p> <p><strong>1968 </strong>Black leaders unsuccessfully press Congress for a museum.</p> <p><strong>1985 </strong>The owner of a bus-tour company, Tom Mack, starts a fundraising group.</p> <p><strong>1988 </strong>Congressman John Lewis, a civil rights veteran, unsuccessfully introduces a bill for a museum.

  "<p>Nir Baram is an Israeli writer. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/translation-tuesdays-by-asymptote-journal/2016/aug/09/translation-tuesday-good-people-by-nir-baram-extract\" title=\"\"><em>Good People</em></a>, his second novel, has been translated into 10 languages and is now <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/good-people-433148.html\" title=\"\">published in English</a> by Text. He writes for <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Haaretz</em></a> and other newspapers and lives in Tel Aviv.</p> <p><strong>This book looks at the second world war&#xa0;from the perspective of two characters, Sasha and Thomas, who collaborate with Stalin and Hitler respectively. What interested you about&#xa0;that subject?</strong><br>In Israel, the second world war and the Holocaust are something you grow up with. At school, in the army, you sometimes feel that the Holocaust is shoved down your throat. But in literature you tend to come across the usual character types: either the bureaucrats such as Eichmann, or the highly perverse caricature of a Nazi. In contrast, I wanted to look at the role of brilliant and creative people, kind of \u201cfree spirits\u201d, who happened to find themselves living under those regimes. Sasha, for example, may not agree with the objectives of the NKVD, but working for them provides her first chance to shine, and an opportunity to realise her talents.</p> <p>Thomas has the cultural contempt for nazism that many bourgeois Germans had. But he sees the job offer from the Foreign Office as an opportunity to become a great man in Germany. He is not a coward: he takes major risks to achieve his goals.</p> <p>It interested me that in that situation, there would have to be a deal between the individual and the regime: the regime would get to use the individual\u2019s talents, and in return the individual would get an opportunity for fulfilment. Both sides are both being used by, and using, the other.</p> <p><strong>Do you see any parallels with the moral dilemmas facing contemporary Israelis?</strong><br>I see parallels in every society. Those of us who live in capitalist societies often go out and work for corporations that contradict our political ideas. And then we come home and rant on Facebook or go out to a protest.</p> <p>In Israel it is very interesting how many people can function while working for organisations that totally contradict their personal beliefs. And I don\u2019t mean that in a judgmental way, just to observe that literature can try to understand what that means, psychologically: how can we go out into the world and live within a society that we may consider to be unjust? It must involve a level of personal denial: in every case of genocide, you have a small group of people who actually commit the atrocities, and a great many other people who are greasing the genocide machine.</p> <p><strong>Was either Sasha or Thomas based on a real historical figure?</strong><br>I did a lot of historical research, obviously, but it was important to me that these characters and their precise roles were made up. Both of them have strange positions, as writers in the service of the regime. I wanted to give the reader a sense of having an imaginary journey within this historical landscape.</p> <p>So Thomas, for example, is inspired by Gatsby, and also by Ulrich, the protagonist of Robert Musil\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jun/17/featuresreviews.guardianreview28\" title=\"\"><em>The Man Without Qualities</em></a>.</p> <p><strong>One of the book\u2019s strengths is its intimate portrayal of life in wartime Germany and Russia \u2013 it brings to life the daily chaos and terror of these turbulent societies. How did you research it?</strong><br>I read many books about the period, and testimonies of people who lived through it. But most importantly I travelled to many of the places mentioned in the book: Lublin, Warsaw and Brest-Litovsk. I needed to create the personal landscapes of Sasha and Thomas, to see what they would have seen when they woke up in the morning.</p> <p><strong>As I read the book, I was trying to work out to what extent the title is ironic\u2026</strong><br>It is ironic! But you are right, I think the extent of the irony changes from chapter to chapter. Clearly, as a writer you allocate to your characters some of your own qualities, your background and memories. But I also wanted to maintain a certain distance from them, that was quite deliberate, and perhaps it is why some people have found the book cold. Sometimes I identified with them, and sometimes I felt repulsion for what they were doing. I don\u2019t have things planned out from the beginning \u2013 I leave myself open to surprises and variations as I write.</p> <p><strong>This novel was published in Israel in 2010. What have you been working on since?</strong><br>My next book to be published in English will be a nonfiction book about&#xa0;Israel, <em>In a Land Without Borders.</em> I was very interested as someone who has long been involved in politics [Baram\u2019s father and grandfather were both Israeli politicians] to go out and challenge my political beliefs against the reality of the West Bank.</p> <p><em>Good People is published by Text (\u00a310.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/good-people-433152.html\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a39.01</em></a></p>",
  "<p>In American presidential campaigns, September is the cruellest month. It is the time, following the long summer break, when partisan warfare resumes in earnest. It is the moment when the gloves really come off. The primary season is past, the Democratic and Republican party conventions are over, the presidential nominees have been formally acclaimed. Now begins the hard, fast, unforgiving head-to-head run towards November\u2019s national winning post.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton should be cantering towards a clear victory. After 25 years in public life, the Democratic candidate has unmatched experience. She has been tested in roles as varied as first lady, senator and secretary of state. She has raised the profile of women in politics to new heights, taking her lifelong role as \u201cceiling-cracker\u201d (her word) to the doors of the Oval Office. In Donald Trump, she faces a fourth-rate rival who has proved himself unfit for office, a bigoted, ignorant man who feeds off lies and hate. She should be a shoo-in.</p> <p>Instead, September has seen Clinton stumble. As independent and undecided voters begin to focus on their choice, Clinton\u2019s unusually poor approval ratings are assuming critical importance. Trump\u2019s risible, insincere attempts to move away from the extreme right have given him an undeserved bounce. Clinton\u2019s averaged-out poll lead is down to less than two points. In some surveys, Trump is actually moving ahead.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s biggest stumble was a physical one, in New York last Sunday when she fainted, almost fell, lost a shoe and had to be helped away. The subsequent furore, her belated admission she was suffering from pneumonia, the realisation this had been concealed for days and the suspicion she was hiding something worse conspired to highlight one of Clinton\u2019s two big vulnerabilities: lack of trust. Put bluntly, when she states a fact, makes a pledge or offers an explanation, there is a widespread tendency not to believe her.</p> <p>Trust is always a big issue in presidential campaigns. But in Clinton\u2019s case, as has become customary throughout her career, she is constantly held to a higher standard than her contemporaries. She has, for example, been relentlessly castigated over her use of private email when secretary of state. Ideally, she would have adopted a more secure method of communication. But not even the most rabid Republicans have demonstrated any serious consequences as a result. That predecessors did the same thing and escaped censure is not viewed as a double standard.</p> <p>Clinton was in charge when the US mission in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked and its diplomats killed in 2012. But to blame her, rather than Barack Obama, or the CIA, or the Marine Corps \u2013 whose job is to protect embassies \u2013 is grossly unfair. To criticise Clinton for her refusal to divorce Bill after his relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky was revealed is to treat her very differently from the partners of other erring politicians.</p> <p>Clinton is still dogged by the so-called White House travel office scandal of early 1993, an insignificant affair but one that established the subsequent, long-lasting narrative of a bossy, arrogant, untruthful person who brooks no criticism. Whether the issue is healthcare reform, which she attempted as first lady and was pilloried for, or sensitive questions of equal rights, which she has championed with growing confidence in recent years, Clinton has been hounded at every turn in a hostile, frequently crude manner that other public figures simply do not experience.</p> <p>A common factor in all of these controversies is the fact that Clinton is a woman \u2013 which despite all that has been achieved over women\u2019s rights, remains her other big political vulnerability. For being a Yale-trained lawyer and partner in a leading law firm, for retaining her maiden name of Rodham, for insisting on maintaining an independentlife while married to a president, for pursuing a political career in tandem with motherhood, and now for presuming to become America\u2019s first female leader, it seems a significant chunk of the public and the media cannot forgive her.</p> <p>Clinton has been called a feminazi, a shrew, a scold, a harridan, even a dominatrix who has emasculated America. Her famous 1992 defence of her troubled marriage \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not sitting here some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette. I\u2019m sitting here because I love him and I respect him\u201d \u2013 was misrepresented as proof that she looked down on traditional female roles. She fuelled the misogynist fire by defending her legal career: \u201cI suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas but what I decided to do was fulfil my profession, which I entered before my husband was in public life.\u201d</p> <p>For supposedly outraged conservatives, the storyline of Hillary, untrustworthy betrayer of American womanhood, was set in stone. It has not changed much since, and according to Tammy Vigil of Boston University, Clinton is still struggling with it. \u201cRight out of the gate she was getting slammed for the pantsuits, the hair, the headbands, her appearance, her life choices, and everything she said was so heavily scrutinised. I think she became defensive. And now she\u2019s trying not to be as defensive, but it\u2019s sort of still there.\u201d Even her recent illness was used to fortify this critique: namely, that Clinton, unlike the 17-stone, 70-year-old Trump, cannot take the strain, cannot be trusted to tell the truth, and is unfit for office,</p> <p>Far from undermining women, Clinton is a standard bearer on the cusp of an historic breakthrough. It may be said she lacks a new vision of governance, that her ideas are rooted in the discredited Clinton-Blair New Democrat/New Labour era, and that, in foreign affairs, she can be both too aggressive (for example, towards Iran) and too cautious, as on Palestinian rights. In personal dealings, she is undoubtedly sometimes prickly and impatient, though these failings are exaggerated.</p> <p>At the same time, her achievement in overcoming the extraordinary bias and prejudice ranged against her is admirable. Clinton combines intelligence, courage, energy, determination and a powerful sense of destiny. That she is by any measure the best candidate on offer in November cannot be sensibly denied. That she is America\u2019s last defence against Trump\u2019s appalling sexism, racial prejudice and dangerous xenophobia is seriously sobering. Like her or not \u2013 totally trust her or not \u2013 Clinton deserves support. Non-voters across the globe must hope she will avoid new stumbles, keeps well \u2013 and wins.</p>",

And then, on top of that, he raped me four times. Four times,\u201d says Zidane.</p> <p>She still lives in the compound where she was arrested, along with her extended family.</p> <p>\u201cAs soon as I saw Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 and our eyes met, everything he did to me came back. I just started telling it. Allah is my witness, even now when I think about it, my heart breaks. Even as I talk to you, the images of what he did to me come back.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018They pushed me to the floor\u2019</h2> <p>Zidane\u2019s family are Chadians of Libyan origin. When she was arrested, she was told her brother had joined the Libyan air force and attacked Chad. Habr\u00e9\u2019s secret police took her to a room in the presidency with a hole in the ceiling, and said her brother had been imprisoned there and had escaped. They wanted to know how he\u2019d done it.</p> <p>When she said she had heard nothing from her brother for a long time, they didn\u2019t believe her.</p> <p>\u201cThey pushed me on to the floor and forced a pipe into my mouth. They started pumping water into me. They put a tyre on my stomach and pressed down. That was the first time. As I told them in Dakar, Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 did unspeakable things to me. He would torture me before he raped me.\u201d</p> <p>This water torture was one of many techniques used by the Directorate of Documentation and Security (DDS), Habr\u00e9\u2019s notorious secret police. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97be4ba3fa8d679bdb6c8f1be1a966a8cf803f27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97be4ba3fa8d679bdb6c8f1be1a966a8cf803f27/0_196_4608_2765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Khadidja Zidane\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Khadidja Zidane: Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 oversaw her torture, and raped her four times.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ruth Maclean/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p>\u201cMy whole body is marked \u2013 look,\u201d she says, showing where she had been electrocuted under her arms. \u201cLook,\u201d taking off her headscarf and exposing her neck, \u201cthey strangled me with a rope.

Someone who disrespects you like that.\u201d</p> <p>On his website, Habr\u00e9 called Zidane a \u201cnymphomaniac prostitute\u201d after hearing her testimony.</p> <p>However, the <a href=\"http://www.chambresafricaines.org/\">extraordinary African chambers</a> \u2013 the tribunal set up to try Habr\u00e9 \u2013 changed the charges at the last minute and convicted Habr\u00e9 of rape, based on her account. </p> <p>The verdict sets a precedent. It represents \u201ca huge brick in the wall that establishes sexual violence as international crimes\u201d, says Kim Thuy Seelinger, director of the sexual violence programme at Berkeley Law\u2019s Human Rights Centre in the US. It builds on the tribunals in <a href=\"http://unictr.unmict.org/\">Rwanda</a> and <a href=\"http://www.icty.org/\">Yugoslavia</a>, and will make a huge contribution to the jurisprudence that any future tribunal dealing with sexual violence as a crime against humanity will be able to draw on, she says.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing, honestly, that this small court with so few resources and such limited time was able to pound out this type of very progressive and clear jurisprudence on sexual violence. It\u2019s a huge testament to the victims who were willing to come forward after so much time, the lawyers for those victims, and the African community that helped make the court happen.\u201d</p> <h2>A weapon to inspire terror </h2> <p>Zidane was the only person to testify that she was raped by Habr\u00e9. Rape, however, was widely used as a weapon by the military and police, to sow terror in women, children as young as seven and, in some cases, men.<br></p> <p>Ginette Ngarbaye was doing the laundry at home with her cousin when an acquaintance came by the house on his motorbike. He said her aunt had asked him to come and pick her up.</p> <p>\u201cSince I was innocent, I didn\u2019t have anything to fear,\u201d says Ngarbaye, now secretary of the victims\u2019 association, sitting in the organisation\u2019s tumbledown headquarters, a few faded printouts of victims taped to the wall behind her. \u201cMy cousin said: \u2018Today, it\u2019s your turn\u2019. I said: \u2018My turn for what?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The 19-year-old, who was pregnant, was led through a compound full of soldiers. She was at the DDS headquarters.</p> <p>\u201cIn the office I met a huge, burly man dressed in a white, short-sleeved shirt. It had blood all over it. I immediately knew he was a torturer, and it was then that I remembered what my cousin had said.\u201d</p> <p>On the files all over his desk, she saw names she knew \u2013 names of girls who had disappeared. She and these girls were accused of going to a restaurant frequented by Habr\u00e9\u2019s opponents.</p> <p>\u201cHe called two agents in uniform and they took me into a torture chamber, full of contraptions.\u201d</p> <p>Ngarbaye begins to cry, wiping her face with her yellow wrap. \u201cThey arrest you and tell you not to talk, so it feels good to say it. It\u2019s healing.\u201d</p> <p>The uniformed men took her to a women\u2019s cell, where a fellow prisoner told her not to confess anything. </p> <p>Two days later, they came back for her, and took her to the man in the bloodied shirt. \u201cThat day and every evening for a week he tortured me and raped me. I asked: \u2018When will you let me go?\u2019 He said: \u2018When I am satisfied.\u2019 It\u2019s their way of breaking you. And even as they\u2019re raping you, they\u2019re insulting you, and beating you, kicking you.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bef990ce487e429ba37bb40ff4875bfea361e700\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bef990ce487e429ba37bb40ff4875bfea361e700/0_113_4608_2765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ginette Ngarbeye\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ginette Ngarbeye: \u2018And even as they\u2019re raping you, they\u2019re insulting you, and beating you, kicking you.\u2019 For a week she was raped and tortured by a man in a shirt covered in blood, in the headquarters of the victims\u2019 association in N\u2019Djamena.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ruth Maclean/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After a week her torturer and rapist, who she later learned was Issa Arawa\u00ef, moved on to other girls.

She delivered her daughter in the prison.</p> <p>After she got out, Ngarbaye often saw Arawa\u00ef, speeding around N\u2019Djamena in his car. Later, under president Idriss D\u00e9by, he was jailed and tortured himself, and eventually died. But she did not see Habr\u00e9 until the day she testified.</p> <p>\u201cHe was sitting there, jogging his foot up and down,\u201d she says. \u201cHe pretended to adjust his turban, and looked at me out of the corner of his eye. When I saw him, I was looking at a monster. It was like looking at a man who has massacred all his children. I tried hard to talk, but I really wanted to jump on him and bite him, tear him apart. We lost a lot of good people in this country because of Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9.\u201d</p> <p>Officials of the regime kept meticulous records, and thousands of documents were strewn across the DDS headquarters after Habr\u00e9 was deposed. Gathered by Human Rights Watch, they show that the DDS answered directly to Habr\u00e9. He personally gave orders and signed death warrants.</p> <p>At his trial, Habr\u00e9\u2019s tactic was not to defend himself, but rather, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/chadian-dictators-tactics-mimic-script-of-former-rulers-facing-criminal-charges-45395\">following a path well-trodden by dictators, to refuse to recognise the authority of the court</a>. He was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/20/chad-hissene-habre-war-crimes-trial-senegal-removed-from-court-as-scuffle-breaks-out\">dragged in</a> on the first day, and thereafter sat in white robes, a turban and dark glasses, the only visible part of his face wearing an expression of contempt. His lawyers say they will appeal against the verdict, although it is not clear whether he has approved this, as it would entail recognising the court.</p> <h2>Taking the stand</h2> <p>It was only when they were sure that Habr\u00e9 would be tried that the women were persuaded to speak about the rapes by <a href=\"http://www.forumchambresafricaines.org/V1_ficae/entretien-avec-me-jacqueline-moudeina-avocat-conseil-de-lassociation-des-victimes-des-crimes-du-regime-hissein-habre-avcrhh-base-au-tchad/?lang=en\">Jacqueline Moude\u00efna</a>, a Chadian lawyer who has worked since 2000 to bring Habr\u00e9 to justice.</p> <p>\u201cIt was long and patient work,\u201d Moude\u00efna says. \u201cIt was only in 2013 that one of the women drew a picture for me so I\u2019d understand that she\u2019d been raped and that all of the women in the DDS prisons had been raped.</p> <p>\u201cIt was really only a few days before their depositions before the court that I was really able to convince them to speak \u2013 open their hearts and say what happened to them. There was a problem of trust, of course, and particularly the taboo that surrounds rape in Chad. Because I\u2019d been working with them for a long time, I was able to explain it to them. That is what enabled them to break the taboo, to break the silence.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d9c6077945379844c8b92f37b19f3c71e15498f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d9c6077945379844c8b92f37b19f3c71e15498f/132_291_3254_1952/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An exhibition depicting the years Chad was ruled by Habr\u00e9, at the Douta Secke Cultural Centre in Dakar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An exhibition depicting the years Chad was ruled by Habr\u00e9, at the Douta Secke Cultural Centre in Dakar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seyllou/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those who heard the women\u2019s testimonies said they were impossible for the Burkinabe judge, Gberdao Kam, to ignore. But the fact that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/dec/22/chad-hissene-habre-lawyers-sexual-slavery-rape-charges-trial\">changed the charges</a> was also thanks to a brief that Seelinger and colleagues submitted to the court, signed by experts on sexual violence as an international crime. This gave Kam a blueprint for how he could charge Habr\u00e9 for rape as a crime against humanity, both in terms of customary international law and under the statute the court was using.</p> <p>\u201cIt went from a case where there was zero sexual violence in the charging recommended by the investigating judges to a verdict that was really heavy with sexual violence,\u201d Seelinger says. \u201cIt\u2019s great, it\u2019s astounding, and it\u2019s quite dramatic in terms of international jurisprudence.\u201d</p> <p>Moude\u00efna says the verdict could protect other women, and she has been contacted by groups across Africa inspired to bring perpetrators to justice.

But the 2016 presidential race is deeply personal. </p> <p>Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, for years promoted the false \u201cbirther\u201d movement that questioned Barack Obama\u2019s origins \u2013 to the extent that he claimed to have sent <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/04/07/trump-sends-investigators-to-hawaii-to-look-into-obama/\">investigators </a>to Hawaii to search for his birth certificate in 2011. On Friday, Trump conceded that the president was born in the United States.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s careful cultivation of the lie, and his refusal to denounce it even as recently as Thursday, has crippled the Republican\u2019s standing with black voters, who widely view the birther campaign as an attempt to delegitimize the first black president. Public opinion polls show that he draws a historically low support from black voters, with some surveys showing <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/donald-trump-gets-0-support-black-voters-ohio-pennsylvania-nbc-n609026\">0%</a> among black voters. </p> <p>In her speech at the Democratic national convention, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/26/michelle-obama-convention-speech-female-president\">an aspirational and devastating riposte</a> to Trump\u2019s vision for America, Michelle Obama remembered her daughters\u2019 first day of school, and the lurching feeling when she realized that they would grow up in the White House. </p> <p>\u201cI realized that our time in the White House would form the foundation for who they would become, and how well we managed this experience could truly make or break them,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThat is what Barack and I think about every day as we try to guide and protect our girls through the challenges of this unusual life in the spotlight \u2013 how we urge them to ignore those who question their father\u2019s citizenship or faith. </p> <p>\u201cHow we insist that the hateful language they hear from public figures on TV does not represent the true spirit of this country. How we explain that when someone is cruel, or acts like a bully, you don\u2019t stoop to their level \u2013 no, our motto is, when they go low, we go high.\u201d</p> <p>Obama\u2019s swan song speech was quickly elevated to the pantheon of historic political addresses. Some delegates in the audience wept freely as the first lady spoke.</p> <p>On the campaign trail, Clinton voiced appreciation for her powerful and most popular ally.<br></p> <p>\u201cAs Michelle Obama said in her fabulous speech at the Democratic convention, when we go to the polls this November, the real choice isn\u2019t between Democrat or Republican,\u201d Clinton said in Greensboro, North Carolina, on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives.\u201d</p> <p>Though they share a goal on the campaign trail, Obama and Clinton could not have had more opposite ambitions in their roles as first lady.</p> <p>\u201cMichelle Obama can\u2019t wait to leave the White House and Hillary Clinton can\u2019t wait to get back in,\u201d said Kate Andersen Brower, journalist and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/First-Women-Americas-Modern-Ladies/dp/0062439650\">author of First Women</a>.</p> <p>Unlike Clinton, who broke with many of the traditions and norms expected of a presidential spouse, including the unprecedented step of setting up an office in the West Wing, Obama has remained firmly in the East Wing. She has devoted herself to supporting military families, fighting childhood obesity and advocating for girls\u2019 education. Under Obama\u2019s leadership, the White House launched the <a href=\"http://www.letsmove.gov/\">Let\u2019s Move</a> campaign to reduce child obesity and the <a href=\"https://letgirlslearn.gov/\">Let Girls Learn</a> initiative, to improve access to education for girls around the world. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/16/michelle-obama-birther-clinton-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/53bkg\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2724829\"            data-video-name=\"Michelle Obama slams Trump's 'birtherism' during Clinton rally \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57dc667fe4b0a8cdc623873c\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/16/160916michelle_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/16/160916michelle.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/16/160916michelle_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/16/michelle-obama-birther-clinton-video\">Michelle Obama slams Trump\u2019s \u2018birtherism\u2019 during Clinton rally</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>She has also cemented herself as a cultural icon, with a reach far beyond the realm of politics. Last week, she poured boxed wine for customers at a drug store with talk show host Ellen Degeneres. Before the DNC, she <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ln3wAdRAim4\">sang carpool karaoke</a> with comedian James Corden. And the Obamas posed for an intimate portrait published on the cover of the October issue of Essence, a lifestyle magazine directed toward black women. </p> <p>\u201cI think when it comes to black kids, it means something for them to have spent most of their life seeing the family in the White House look like them,\u201d she told the magazine. \u201cIt matters. All the future work that Barack talked about, I think over these last few years, we\u2019ve kind of knocked the ceiling of limitation off the roofs of many young kids; imaginations of what\u2019s possible for them.\u201d</p> <p>At the university on Friday, the graduate student Katie Boyette echoed the first lady\u2019s sentiments, and recalled watching Obama\u2019s inauguration, \u201cwalking on to the stage with his family, and they just looked so beautiful\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI was only 15 at the time, but seeing them, as an African American,\u201d she said, \u201cit was a pivotal moment for me. I started to cry. It was a moment I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d</p> <p>Before the event, Obama reflected with former first lady Laura Bush at the National Archives, in Washington DC, about the power of their platform.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact is you really have a podium, really, always. People still listen to Barbara Bush, don\u2019t you think? I certainly do,\u201d Bush said, referring to her mother-in-law, the wife of George HW Bush. </p> <p>Obama said she would continue to the work she started in the White House: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that I\u2019ll leave here and really kick my feet up and say, \u2018Oh, well, good luck with that.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>After Obama\u2019s rousing DNC speech, speculation \u2013 most wishful \u2013 mounted that it might launch a national political career, as such a speech did for her husband in 2004.</p> <p>But Obama has swatted away any speculation that she might seek office one day and earlier this year, the president lowered the chances of a double act to zero. </p> <p>\u201cThere are three things that are certain in life,\u201d the president said during a town hall in Louisiana. \u201cDeath, taxes and Michelle is not running for president.\u201d</p> <p>And yet some still hold out hope.<br></p> <p>\u201cFour more years!\u201d the college crowd chanted on Friday when Obama said her family\u2019s time in the White House had nearly come to an end. \u201cNo!\u201d Obama said, waving her hand and laughing. \u201cNo,\u201d she tried again, more emphatically.</p> <p>After the event, Rachelle Campbell didn\u2019t hesitate for a moment. </p> <p>\u201cOh, I would <em>love</em> for her to run for president one day,\u201d she said excitedly. \u201cMichelle for president!\u201d</p> <p>As she closed out her speech to the students, Obama spun one of Clinton\u2019s slogans, \u201cI\u2019m with her\u201d, into her own. \u201cI urge you \u2013 I beg of you \u2013 to ignore the chatter and the noise and ask yourselves, which candidate really has the experience, the maturity, and the demeanor to handle the job I just described to you?\u201d she asked the crowd.</p> <p>\u201cI need your help to do that as well.

  "<p>Aisling Bea, 32, is an actor, comedian and writer from County Kildare, Ireland. She lives in Islington, London, with her sister Sin\u00e9ad, a film costume designer. Bea studied French and philosophy at Trinity College Dublin and then went to Lamda. In 2012 she won the So You Think You\u2019re Funny award at the Edinburgh festival and has appeared on various panel shows and in the sitcoms <em>Dead Boss </em>and <em>Trollied</em>. A role in the new series of BBC crime thriller <em>The Fall </em>will take her back to her dramatic roots.</p> <p><strong>What was it like to be the newbie on set on a show as successful as <em>The Fall</em>?</strong><br>I had a ball. Northern Irish people tend to have this sharp, dark sense of humour. Everyone, including myself, took the work very seriously but no one took themselves too seriously. I also felt lucky to be there as Allan Cubbitt (the writer and director) took a chance casting me because of how much comedy I have done the last few years. I really wanted to do a good job for him as much as myself.</p> <p><strong>What impact did winning the award at Edinburgh have on your career? You were only the second woman to win it.</strong><br>For me it was just a competition that got me to tighten up some of my jokes but after I won it there was definitely a hoo-ha that I didn\u2019t expect. The attention made me a bit paranoid for a while but it opened many doors and was definitely one of those turning points you hear people talk about in interviews.</p> <p><strong>Who are your comedy heroes?</strong><br>I went to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/oct/01/billy-connolly-big-yin-comedy-aberdeen-music-hall-tour\">Billy Connolly do two hours</a>, with no break, at the Apollo, with Parkinson\u2019s disease, during the winter, and it was one of the most important gigs I have seen in my life. I found him mainly hilarious, but I was also just learning watching him. He is an inspiring master of storytelling. The funniest person I know though is Brona C Titley, who is also an actor and writer and one of my best friends and a soulmate.</p> <p><strong>Your mother was a flat-race jockey, and your father was a vet \u2013 why didn\u2019t you opt for a more stable career?</strong><br>I am too fat and tall to be a jockey. This is not self-deprecation, I realise that I am neither too fat nor too tall; but I am too fat and too tall to be a jockey. Fact. As for a vet, my father put his hand up cows\u2019 arses and mares\u2019 vaginas for a living and I suppose I feel I have an air of glamour that would conflict with that life. It\u2019s that thing of parents working really hard so their kids can be whatever they want.</p> <p><strong>And now you live in London. Would you ever move back to Ireland?</strong><br>I feel at home in London. The Irish community here is strong and vibrant and we are like a pack of mushrooms all sprouting up in the same areas. Would I go back? I don\u2019t know. Most of my world is in London and I feel like this is where I went mad and ended up finding myself. My sister is here. And my mother is always on Facebook.</p> <p><strong>So you can always keep in touch with her. Now that the UK has voted for Brexit, and Ireland is still part of the EU, do you see that changing the dynamic between the two?</strong><br>Ireland is very European. The EU built a lot of our roads and bailed us out when things went tits up. Brexit is not ideal. I\u2019m famously not a Brexit negotiator, but relations between Ireland and the UK have been getting stronger and a big part of that has been trade and feeling like sister countries within the EU. I don\u2019t think it will affect the \u201cvibe\u201d of relations, but it will have a significant effect on trade and business. I wonder how much more TV and film will start to use Ireland as somewhere to make stuff. An EU base with an English-speaking workforce and castles for the background? That will be interesting to see.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019re in LA. What are you doing there?</strong><br>I just did a show called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/nov/20/midnight-made-america-fall-in-love-panel-show\"><em>@Midnight</em></a> which is the closest thing to a panel show they have in the States. It was my first US TV spot and I was sweaty and nervous but it all records in an hour and airs the same night. I love LA. Some people arrive with big expectations and are inevitably disappointed, but I can audition in the day which can be gruelling and lonely, but then gig and be creative in the evenings. I am making no money, but creatively it is rewarding.</p> <p><strong>Do you like doing panel shows? </strong><br>I love doing them but some days are tough work, just because of energy levels, subject matter or the chemistry between the people. I was on <em>League of Their Own</em> recently; I was the only girl and I think that the lads sort of forgot. We had to get into football gear and Tony Adams, who is the world\u2019s nicest man, was just getting his kit off forgetting he wasn\u2019t back in a dressing room with the England team. I got a flash. That man is still in very good shape.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6dec004745a327d51f017f39604c535fa3e55cde\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6dec004745a327d51f017f39604c535fa3e55cde/235_1236_2253_2815/800.jpg\" alt=\"Comedy actor/writer Sharon Horgan, with whom Bea worked on Dead Boss.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Comedy actor/writer Sharon Horgan, with whom Bea worked on Dead Boss.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You are good friends with </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/dec/16/sharon-horgan-little-crackers-pulling\"><strong>Sharon Horgan</strong></a><strong>, who you worked with on <em>Dead Boss</em>. What is she like to work with and will you work together again?</strong><br>We played sisters in <em>Dead Boss </em>and I find myself naturally being a little sister figure to her. We wrote half a film together which didn\u2019t go ahead. Now I\u2019ve written this script which Channel 4 seem to really like \u2013 it\u2019s about sisters \u2013 but I can\u2019t say much more in case it doesn\u2019t get made. I do really like the script. It\u2019s quite close to my heart.</p> <p><strong>You campaigned for same-sex marriage legislation in the Ireland referendum. Do you remember where you were when 62% voted Yes?</strong><br>I was in a Premier Inn in Newcastle during a weekend of gigs, crying over my laptop watching the news and wanting to hop on a plane back to Dublin. It was one of the proudest, happiest, most glorious days in Irish history. It\u2019s a big thing for a Catholic country.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019re also heavily involved with </strong><a href=\"http://www.abortionrightscampaign.ie/repealthe8th/\"><strong>Repeal the 8th</strong></a><strong>, the campaign to make abortion legal in Ireland. Do you see that happening in the near future?</strong></p> <p>The women of Ireland are already repealing, we are shouting it from the rooftops and from the bedsides of friends and family who have had to sit in a cinema in England for a day after an abortion with nowhere to go, just waiting until it is time to get the Stansted Express for their late-night Ryanair flight. The question is how long the government will pretend to ignore the problem.</p> <p><strong>You studied French and philosophy at Trinity College Dublin. But do you have any favourite French philosophers?</strong><br>I mean everyone loves a bit of Jean-Paul Sartre, but I am a bit more into practical life philosophy. I love Alain de Botton, and listen to his little <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/schooloflifechannel/featured\">School of Life YouTube </a>vids as I do the dishes. I shout: \u201cThat\u2019s right, Oprah\u201d when he says something deep that I connect with.</p> <p><strong>Who is scarier \u2013 Jamie Dornan as Paul Spector in <em>The Fall </em>or James Norton as Tommy Lee Royce in <em>Happy Valley</em>?</strong><br>Well, I know Jamie now and he is the loveliest man. James was at drama school with my sister Sin\u00e9ad and also seems like a very nice man. However, the writing on both shows is beautiful, and there are also many great parts for women. That is why they are two of my favourite shows \u2013 not just because of the hot psychopaths.</p> <p><em>The third series of the Fall starts on 29 September at 9pm on BBC2</em></p>",

This is so subtly conveyed in Canadian artist <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKHHNHyyLi4\">Stan Douglas\u2019s <em>Luanda-Kinshasa</em></a><em>, </em>you don\u2019t immediately know what he\u2019s up to. On screen is a jazz-funk jam session at a Columbia Records studio some time in the 70s. It is sumptuous \u2013 the riffs slowly developing, the beat building before (and inside) you, the musicians characteristically rapt. The quality of colour, the noticing of every shaft of smoky light and dancing dust mote, of hoop earrings and oiled afros, the bass player\u2019s terrible lace shirt and the drummer\u2019s psychedelic tunic: every detail is so superbly depicted that you begin to wonder how (and when) the film was made.</p> <p>More and more instruments join in \u2013 bongos, Moogs, Hammond organ. It seems to be one single session with numerous cameras, yet this is surely impossible. No way could the cameras have swept so seamlessly among all these African musicians.

  "<p><a href=\"http://akademi.co.uk/\">Akademi </a>was founded in 1979 to promote the understanding of South Asian dance in Britain, and in Illicit Worlds of Indian Dance, an event curated by writer and ethnomusicologist Anna Morcom, the organisation leads us into some of the art form\u2019s more secretive byways.</p> <p>Natalia Hildner opens the evening with a traditional mujra dance. Her performance, delicately lyrical in its interplay of gaze and gesture, reproduces those of the courtesans of the Mughal era, who danced to ghazals (love poems) for princes and nawabs. Mujra dancers were highly valued for their classical kathak dance skills but were considered unmarriable. Moralistic legislation in the late 19th and early 20th century further marginalised them, forcing many into prostitution.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f634189950aaea5867b0d1e02dd7d4ae99bb5b68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f634189950aaea5867b0d1e02dd7d4ae99bb5b68/0_0_2800_4200/667.jpg\" alt=\"Leela Ek Paheli in Akademi\u2019s Illicit Worlds of Indian Dance.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leela Ek Paheli in Akademi\u2019s Illicit Worlds of Indian Dance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vipul Sangoi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The mujra style survived in the performances of Mumbai\u2019s bar dancers. Their more overtly sexualised form of mujra, danced not to ghazals but to Hindi film songs, is demonstrated by dancer and choreographer Emiko Ishii. Her moves are much raunchier than those of the Mughal-era courtesans, but no less elaborate or choreographically sophisticated. In 2005, bar dancing was banned, as mujra dancing had been a century earlier.</p> <p>Far from dying out, the style found new champions. Today, middle-class Indian housewives take mujra classes, and private and often steamy performances take place behind closed doors. The idiom has also been adopted by cross-dressed male performers, and it\u2019s with their appearance that the Akademi evening takes a truly exotic turn.</p> <p>Leela Ek Paheli is a drag performer who dances to bubblegum Hindi film hits, channelling Bollywood female megastars such as Sridevi and Madhuri Dixit. It\u2019s a high camp performance, capturing Sridevi\u2019s goo-goo-eyed voluptuousness with particularly lethal precision, but it\u2019s also technical dancing of a very high order. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/19/asifa-lahore-first-gay-asian-drag-queen\">Asifa Lahore</a>, Britain\u2019s first out Muslim drag queen, is as dazzling as she is outrageous, tripping on to the stage in a burqa before delivering a smouldering song medley in a cocktail frock (\u201cMake me cook, make me clean, Asian men are so mean\u2026\u201d).</p> <p>But it\u2019s Raheem Mir who\u2019s the evening\u2019s brightest star. Performing a classic mujra dance from the film<em> Umrao Jaan</em>, set in 19th-century Lucknow, Mir becomes both the film\u2019s eponymous heroine and the actress (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjodPfFdVe0\">Rekha</a>) who embodies her. With its sliding glances, subtly suggestive carriage of head and neck, and liquid arms and wrists, Mir\u2019s performance is gesture-perfect. In its gender aspects, and as a marginalised dance form, it\u2019s also doubly subversive. Much food for reflection here. A fascinating detour.</p>",
  "<p>A healthy diet is not about Instagrammed asparagus, glowing skin or a feeling of wellbeing \u2013 it\u2019s about eating foods that help you to avoid disease. That simple message has been muddied by pseudoscience nutritionists and celebrity health gurus, clambering over each other to persuade you to buy their products.</p> <p>With a healthy diet you can avoid risk factors such as being overweight, having high blood pressure and developing diabetes, which lead to serious cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and strokes. It\u2019s concerning, then, with the burden of obesity and disease falling on the poor, that health is being packaged and sold through a soft-focus lens as an aspirational product beyond many people\u2019s means.</p> <p>Nothing could be further from the truth. The much-vaunted Mediterranean diet, for instance, is one of peasants. Born of a needs-must school of eating, it emphasises varied, seasonal, humble and largely plant-based ingredients: fruit and veg, fibrous carbs, legumes, nuts, a bit of meat, and healthy fats such as olive oil. Doesn\u2019t sound too expensive, does it?</p> <p>Most nutritionists and health gurus agree with doctors and scientists on the fundamentals of a healthy diet \u2013 the idea is to eat more protective foods and fewer damaging ones. Anything else is a selling point people use to stand out in the marketplace.</p> <p>Here we look at the basic pillars of a healthy diet with ingredients and recipes that follow three guiding principles: they are accessible, inexpensive and simple to cook.</p> <h2>Fruit and veg</h2> <p>Fruit and veg are good for you, but even this message has been spun to make money.</p> <p>They\u2019re not good for you because of magical detoxifying properties. Whether it\u2019s goji or acai berries or concentrated vegetable gloop, these things often come with scientific-sounding words, such as flavonoids and antioxidants, attached, usually just to sell you something.</p> <p>Catherine Collins, dietitian at St George\u2019s hospital, London, says that pseudoscientists latch onto the fact that there are chemicals in all fruit and veg which affect our health. \u201cBut they cherrypick scientific concepts and make simplistic, unproven associations with human health and specific outcomes to justify their viewpoint,\u201d she says.</p> <p>What we do know is that by eating fruit and veg you can lower the risk of disease. Because they contain artery-relaxing nitrates, familiar vegetables such as spinach, lettuce and radishes, can lower blood pressure. The potassium in green leafy veg, squash and mushrooms does the same. These vegetables might not be glamorous, but given that high blood pressure has overtaken smoking as the leading risk for disease and death you\u2019d be foolish to push them to the side of your plate.</p> <h2>Fats</h2> <p>That saturated fats aren\u2019t as bad as once thought has led to PR spin that has only confused matters. A prime example is coconut oil. With no good evidence that eating coconut oil regularly will keep you healthy, inaccurate marketing has used interesting theoretical health properties to make it more desirable.</p> <p>Saturated fats such as butter, if enjoyed sensibly, are neutral to your health: they are not protective like olive oil but are not damaging like trans fats or excess sugars. It\u2019s unsaturated ones from whole food sources such as oily fish, nuts, seeds and olive oil that should be your fats of choice.</p> <p>Where evidence is strongest is with boring olive oil. There\u2019s no need to fork out for the expensive stuff, the economical extra-virgin type will do fine. Watch out for processed spreads and fats branded as omega-3 fortified and mayonnaise with 5% added olive oil. If you\u2019re eating it in a bid to be extra healthy, you\u2019re wasting your time.</p> <p>Oily fish can be a little trickier \u2013 its shelf life can make it difficult to squeeze into a busy family\u2019s schedule Its expense, too, can be prohibitive. Unless you\u2019re Richard Branson or a grizzly bear with a fishing rod, you\u2019re unlikely to be able to eat as much salmon as you\u2019d like, but there are options that aren\u2019t so hard on the wallet.</p> <p>Grilled mackerel in the summer is always a winner. Cornish sardines are increasingly popular since their rebranding (they were <a href=\"http://www.cornishsardines.org.uk/historical-background.html\">once the more drab-sounding pilchards</a>). Canned fish such as traditional sardines can be store-cupboard superstars but tuna, although classified as oily when fresh, <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/fish-shellfish.aspx\">loses much of its omega-3 when canned</a>.</p> <p>Avocados, nuts and seeds are another good supplementary source to top up your intake. Know where to buy them and they don\u2019t have to be expensive. Ignore them altogether and they can cost you a healthy heart.</p> <h2>Carbs</h2> <p>It seems we have a limited capacity for understanding what bad foods are. As fats have benefited from a PR makeover, carbs have been put in the stocks. Restricting your carb intake is an effective way to lose weight, but to vilify a whole food group by banishing them forever would be to make the same mistakes all over again.</p> <p>Good carbohydrate sources are unrefined, fibre-rich ones such as oats, wholegrains, quinoa, sweet potatoes, squash and legumes, all of which release their sugars slowly. Bad carbs are refined ones such as the white flour used to make white bread and pasta: the refining process takes out all the fibre and leaves you with easily digestible sugar.</p> <p>There\u2019s only one problem: refined carbohydrates are delicious. We\u2019ve evolved to crave energy-dense foods so don\u2019t deny yourself \u2013 just manage how much refined carbohydrate you eat. You can do this by eating a cauliflower crust pizza but, if you\u2019re anything like us, you\u2019ll end up wanting to throw that pizza in the bin after a few bites. If you want pizza eat a proper one, just don\u2019t make it a habit.</p> <p>Brown pasta, too, is about as fun as eating cardboard. Italians don\u2019t eat it so why should you? You can have regular pasta, but limit it to about a quarter of your plate and balance it with other fibre-rich elements such as vegetables that will slow down your digestion and limit the spikes in sugar your liver turns into harmful fats.</p> <p>An obvious way to avoid sugar spikes is to avoid sugar. But there\u2019s no point splashing out on apparently healthy alternatives such as agave nectar, honey or date molasses. These alternatives, says Nita Forouhi, a diabetes clinician-scientist at the MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge, are marketed as \u201chaving antioxidants or a lower GI [glycemic index] value, but there\u2019s no convincing evidence to support swapping table sugar for any of them for health benefits \u2013 they are all \u2018free sugars\u2019 which as a rule we should limit\u201d.</p> <h2>Protein</h2> <p>The apparent health benefits of protein have been thrust into our faces one Instagrammed workout at a time. This link between protein and health, though, is the embodiment of the misunderstanding of what health is: it\u2019s not about six packs and bubble butts, it\u2019s about the avoidance of disease and premature death, admittedly unsexy but undeniably important factors that eating more protein will not improve.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say proteins aren\u2019t important. They\u2019re the building blocks of what makes you (muscles and bones), what holds you together (skin and cartilage) and what keeps everything ticking along (enzymes and hormones).</p> <p>Eating meat is an easy way to get your protein \u2013 the animal does all the hard work and concentrates the nutrients for you \u2013 but it can be expensive, you can\u2019t eat it if you\u2019re a vegetarian, and if you eat too much of it you won\u2019t have space left for more protective foods.</p> <p>Although meat is not essential for health, for many it\u2019s a key part of any meal. The good news is that we can get those satisfying umami flavours we crave as often as we want without breaking the bank or eating too much. As with many peasant dishes of the Mediterranean diet, cooking techniques such as stewing and braising stretch the flavour to other ingredients, such as fibre-rich vegetables. You can also use cheaper cuts such as shin and skirt steak: just go for quality over quantity.</p> <p>Vegetarians, fear not: fibre-rich beans and pulses (legumes), while being a great source of protein, are associated with long-term health protection and so should also be a go-to food for meat eaters. Nuts and seeds, too, can bulk out a salad and their protective fats will leave you fuller for longer.</p> <p>Other than low-quality processed meats there are no bad proteins. Try to trade up excess meat for more protective foods whenever you can \u2013 a healthy diet will protect you from disease more than a six-pack ever will.</p> <h2>Green mango salad (som tum mamuang)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8222f03d6a94a8b04bbf6d472dd304ac2a010b23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8222f03d6a94a8b04bbf6d472dd304ac2a010b23/0_119_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Green mango salad (som tum mamuang)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Green mango salad (som tum mamuang).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tara Fisher/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>South-east Asian cooking transforms a salad from a side dish to the main event, giving a perfect opportunity to eat more fruit, veg, healthy proteins and nuts.

Drain and \u201crefresh\u201d by cooling with cold water \u2013 it\u2019s nice if they are warm but not hot in the salad.</p> <p>Toast the unsalted peanuts in a dry non-stick pan until they have a golden colour.

Finely chop the herbs and include the fragrant coriander stalks as well as the leaves. Add the chicken (or prawns) and incorporate all together in a large bowl with the sliced mango, green beans and crushed, toasted peanuts.</p> <p>The dressing is best made in a mortar and pestle, although you can pulse the ingredients in a blender.</p> <p>Add together the dry ingredients and bash into a smooth paste \u2013 the sugar helps with abrasion.

The simple, fresh flavours and textures complement each other perfectly: hot peppery notes (raw garlic and olive oil), mellow comforting richness (pasta, parmesan and pine nuts) and clean perfumed bite (basil, spinach and courgette). A mixture of pasta and courgette \u201ctagliatelle\u201d keeps the comfort and satisfaction of pasta but packs in more veg alongside other protective ingredients such as garlic, nuts, extra-virgin olive oil and dark green leafy spinach. With the fat from the cheese giving additional satiety, you won\u2019t miss that extra pasta, especially if you pair with a simple sliced tomato and onion salad dressed with a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar.</p> <p>Serves 2<br><strong>courgettes</strong> 2, medium<br><strong>linguine pasta</strong> 100g (50g per person)<br><strong>baby spinach</strong> 2 large handfuls<br><strong>garlic</strong> 1 large clove<br><strong>basil leaves</strong> a big bunch<br><strong>pine nuts</strong> 2 small handfuls (dry toasted)<br><strong>fresh parmesan</strong> a handful, grated<br><strong>extra-virgin olive oil<br></strong><strong>salt and black pepper</strong></p> <p>Make the courgette tagliatelle by taking long length slices of the courgette with a mandoline (largest tooth setting) or a potato peeler until you get to the soft water centre. Keep the soft cores, you can finely chop and add them as they are with the tagliatelle.<br></p> <p>Boil the pasta in plenty of salted water. Wash the spinach, drain and place in a large bowl.</p> <p>Make the pesto while the pasta is cooking. We like to make the pesto in a mortar and pestle for that chunky, fresh-made texture but you can add all the ingredients straight into a blender or food processor.</p> <p>Bash a whole peeled garlic clove with a pinch of salt for extra abrasion until a paste. Add the basil leaves and do the same. Add the toasted pine nuts and parmesan. Drizzle in olive oil to loosen the mixture. Bash and stir away until you have a chunky mixture that\u2019s loose enough to stir into your pasta.</p> <p>The pasta should nearly be ready. Throw in the courgette tagliatelle for the final 2 minutes or just enough to soften but retain a slight bite.</p> <p>Drain and immediately add the hot pasta into the bowl with the spinach and stir. The heat of the pasta will wilt and soften the spinach. Now add your pesto and mix thoroughly. Season with black pepper and a final fresh sprinkle of parmesan.

The squash and legumes, being high in fibre, are the good type of carbs that prevent spikes in blood sugar and subsequent fat storage, the slow-cooked meat stretches that umami satisfaction through the filling, allowing you to use less meat and pack in more protective veg. The roasted beets, too, are rich in artery-relaxing nitrates that can lower blood pressure (it\u2019s why athletes drink beetroot juice to improve their endurance).<br></p> <p>Serves 4 (makes enough sauce for 8-10, freeze leftovers for another meal)<br><strong>minced beef</strong> 500g<br><strong>extra-virgin olive oil<br></strong><strong>onion</strong> 1 large<br><strong>celery</strong> 2 sticks<br><strong>carrot</strong> 2 large, skin on<br><strong>courgette, sweet pepper, aubergine</strong> 1 each<br><strong>garlic</strong> 4 large cloves<br><strong>large chillies</strong> 2 (leave seeds in if you like it hot or add more)<br><strong>salt and pepper<br></strong><strong>tomato puree</strong> 2 large tbsp<br><strong>tomatoes</strong> 2 x 400g tins<br><strong>bay leaves</strong> 3<br><strong>ground cinnamon </strong>1 tsp<br><strong>green lentils </strong>100g<br><strong>chickpeas</strong> 1 tin<br><strong>beetroot</strong> 12 small, uncooked<br><strong>large coquina squash</strong> 1</p> <p>Use a large heavy cast-iron casserole dish that can be placed in the oven. Preheat the oven to 160C/gas mark 3.</p> <p>Over a moderate high heat brown the minced beef in a little splash of olive oil until the edges are crispy and golden brown. While the beef is cooking chop the onions, celery, carrot, and other vegetables along with the garlic and chilli \u2013 use a food processor if you have one.</p> <p>Remove the browned beef with a slotted spoon and add the chopped vegetables to the pan to soften in the same oil. When the veg looks softened and the onions are translucent add back the beef.</p> <p>Season the mix now with salt and black pepper. Add the tomato puree and cook out together for another 2 minutes</p> <p>Now add the tinned tomatoes and equal amount of water (by rinsing out and filling the tomato tin). Add the bay leaves and bring back to simmer.</p> <p>Transfer to the oven to slowly cook for 3 hours to develop a beautiful melting texture and deep umami flavours. Portion out around half to cool and freeze for an easy meal another day.</p> <p>Add a teaspoon of cinnamon and the green lentils (rinsed, boiled for 10 minutes, drained) and chickpeas (rinsed and crushed to a pulse) for the final 30 minutes of cooking.</p> <p>Now to the squash and beetroot. Individually wrap in foil and bake the beetroots, leaving the skin on, for an hour at 180C/gas mark 4 or until a knife passes through the flesh easily. (It\u2019s fine to turn up the heat on the base sauce for the last hour if you\u2019re cooking both at the same time.) Cut and deseed the squash, leaving skin on, season and drizzle with olive oil and roast for an hour or until the flesh is deep orange and the edges are darkened. The tip of a knife should pass easily through the thickest bit of the squash. When cooked and cooled, the skin of the beet will slide off easily; dress with a splash of balsamic if you like. Scoop some flesh out of the squash, mix with the filling, pile high and enjoy.</p> <h2>Mediterranean fisherman\u2019s stew: leek, courgette and cod with chilli and lemon seasoning</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bc38a0493d4e1677a8b3e0ff47dcc1aeed73b46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bc38a0493d4e1677a8b3e0ff47dcc1aeed73b46/0_156_1106_664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mediterranean Fisherman\u2019s stew: leek, courgette and cod with chilli and lemon seasoning\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mediterranean Fisherman\u2019s stew: leek, courgette and cod with chilli and lemon seasoning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tara Fisher/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Humble and sweet courgette and leek, a rich tomato sofrito sauce and subtle white fish highlighted with lemon, parsley and chilli. The plentiful courgettes and leeks become the base of a genuinely healthy meal. The combination of olive oil, tomato, garlic and onion forms the base of the sofrito sauce, a mainstay of Mediterranean cooking. When combined, these ingredients might have a synergistic, protective effect but, most importantly, they give that delicious flavour that transports you to the Italian Riviera. We\u2019ve gone for cod because it\u2019s the nation\u2019s favourite, but experiment with your choice of oily fish.<br></p> <p>Serves 4<br><strong>courgettes</strong> 4 large<br><strong>leeks</strong> 2 large<br><strong>garlic</strong> 4 chunky cloves<br><strong>extra-virgin olive oil<br></strong><strong>salt and black pepper<br></strong><strong>tomato passata</strong> 500g<br><strong>dried chilli flakes<br></strong><strong>cod loin</strong> skinned and filleted, three nice chunks each<br><strong>parsley</strong> a handful, including stalks<br><strong>lemon wedges</strong></p> <p>Cut the washed courgettes and leeks into rounds (approx 2cm thick). Slice the garlic.</p> <p>Heat a good glug of olive oil in a non-stick pan and add the sliced veg. Season with salt and pepper.</p> <p>Turn the temperature down so that the veg sweat without colouring. Make a cartouche with some greaseproof paper (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed-i2jd7WIA\">YouTube it for a quick tutorial</a>) and pop on top. This slow-cooking process accentuates the natural sweetness of the veg. Check on them in 10 minutes and add a splash of water if drying out.</p> <p>After about 20 minutes when the veg have softened add the passata. Sprinkle a pinch of dry chilli. Re-cover and cook until meltingly soft (around 40 minutes).</p> <p>Cut the chunky fish fillet across the length with a sharp knife into scallops. Taste the sauce \u2013 grind some extra pepper and if required add more salt. Pop the fish scallops around the dish on top of the sofrito sauce. Re-cover and cook for 10 minutes.</p> <p>Finely chop the parsley and sprinkle over the dish with extra chilli and a squeeze of lemon to finish.</p> <p>Enjoy <a href=\"http://www.italymagazine.com/news/italian-ritual-fare-la-scarpetta\">scarpetta style</a> with a sensible mop of crusty wholemeal bread, eat light with green side salad or throw in some borlotti beans and cook as a stew.</p> <h2>Aromatic braised chicken, hidden veg and quinoa hot pot</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6c05d3e962c375763a44479e699d379694c42b84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c05d3e962c375763a44479e699d379694c42b84/0_101_1172_703/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aromatic braised chicken, hidden veg and quinoa hot pot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aromatic braised chicken, hidden veg and quinoa hot pot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tara Fisher/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One pot and you\u2019re good to go. The braised, browned and caramelised meat intensifies and spreads the meaty flavour allowing you to sneak in plenty of protective fibre and veg. Quinoa? Because it\u2019s not that fancy any more and with its low glycaemic index it\u2019s better than eating refined carbs.<br></p> <p>Serves 4\u20136 (good to make a big batch, you\u2019ll want the extra)<br></p> <p><strong>chicken</strong> 8 skinless, boneless thighs<br><strong>extra-virgin olive oil<br></strong><strong>onions</strong> 2 large<br><strong>leek</strong> 1 large (or add a third onion)<br><strong>garlic</strong> 6 cloves<br><strong>ginger</strong> a thumb-sized piece<br><strong>chillies</strong> 4 red or green (seeds out for a milder version)<br><strong>tomato puree </strong>2 large tbsp<br><strong>honey </strong>1 tbsp<br><strong>soy sauce</strong> 6 tbsp<br><strong>star anise</strong> 1<br><strong>chestnut mushrooms</strong> 2 handfuls<br><strong>Chinese leaf cabbage</strong> \u00bd a head<br><strong>quinoa</strong> 50g per person<br><strong>spring onions</strong> 4, chopped</p> <p>Use a heavy cast-iron dish in an oven (preheated to 160C/ gas mark 3) for the best, slow-cooked meltiness. You can also just simmer on the hob.</p> <p>Roughly chop the chicken into large strips and brown over a high heat with a splash of olive oil. Don\u2019t overcrowd the pan and if necessary brown the chicken in two batches. Stir occasionally but you are aiming to get some crispy caramelised bits on the edges and bottom of the pan to add umami intensity to the dish.</p> <p>Peel, half and roughly chop the onions into large strips. Do the same with the leek and wash thoroughly to get rid of any muddy bits in the layers. Add to the pan with the browned chicken and start to soften.</p> <p>Peel and roughly chop the garlic and ginger together with the chillies. Leave the seeds in if you like spice or remove if you prefer perfumed warmth. Add to the pan with the tomato puree. Cook together for another couple of minutes.</p> <p>Now add the honey, soy sauce, star anise and enough cold water to barely cover (around 2 glasses usually). Bring to a simmer and scrape around the bottom of the pan to dislodge any crispy bits. Place in your preheated oven to slow cook and braise for the next 2 hours.</p> <p>After 2 hours remove, stir and check the hot pot. You should have a reduced, intensely umami-flavoured sauce. You want this to be strong because it will become diluted by the water in the additional veg. Now add your washed and sliced mushrooms and Chinese cabbage. Return to the oven for another hour.</p> <p>Towards the end, boil the quinoa separately until the seeds open. Drain and then add straight into the hot pot and stir together. Fish out the star anise and taste for final seasoning \u2013 add a final splash of soy sauce if you like. Garnish with finely chopped spring onion for a fresh finish.</p> <p><em>Ali Khavandi is a consultant cardiologist. </em><a href=\"http://www.alikhavandi.com/\"><em>alikhavandi.com</em></a><em>; </em><a href=\"http://www.daramohammadi.com/\"><em>daramohammadi.com</em></a></p>",

  "<p>\u201cEven in death you are accursed,\u201d roars the chorus at the end of Bellini\u2019s <strong>Norma</strong> as the sinners are engulfed by flames. So much for redemption. Love is crushed in a tissue of lies, faith battered by edict. In this world of ancient druids and Gauls, based on a French verse poem, recreated in the ornate Italian bel canto style and, in the <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/norma-by-alex-olle\">Royal Opera\u2019s new production</a> conducted by Antonio Pappano, rinsed through with Spanish Catholicism and military imagery, anything goes. The only omission is logic, but when was that the point of opera?</p> <p>In the hands of Spanish-Catalan director Alex Oll\u00e9 of <a href=\"http://www.lafura.com/en/\">La Fura dels Baus</a>, who also staged the Royal Opera\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/29/oedipe-448-psychosis-sarah-kane-die-meistersinger-barbiere-di-siviglia-review-glyndebourne\"><em>Oedipe</em> last season</a>, religion is at once generic and specific. A frightening thicket of tiny crucifixes, which provides the set\u2019s main structure, suggests sacred forest, ossuary and crown of thorns. It looks spectacular, a vast, desiccated insect colony parched of life and meaning, as if God himself is dead or departed. Druids are robed in cottas and pointy capirotes, soutanes or ordinary modern suits. Pollione (Joseph Calleja), the enemy Gaul, with whom Norma (Sonya Yoncheva) is secretly in love, wears a similar grey suit. He could be on either side. Enmity, Oll\u00e9 seems to remind us, comes from a habit of hatred, not from true faith.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65a9fe11323caea13c87e96d54b4cb34cd42436e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65a9fe11323caea13c87e96d54b4cb34cd42436e/0_0_5027_3651/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joseph Calleja as Pollione in Norma.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"726\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joseph Calleja as Pollione in Norma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Belief has to be suspended all round. Norma\u2019s two illicit children reside unseen beneath the high altar in a well-appointed catacomb complete with flatscreen TV, train set and a selection of the latest gimme-gimme gizmos. Occasionally these pale-faced siblings sneak above ground for a maternal hug from their multitasking high priestess mother, who is otherwise engaged in pacifying the bellicose druids, holding off a revolt against the Romans, cutting the holy mistletoe or singing her hymn to the moon, Casta Diva, which just happens to be one of the most challenging and magnificent arias in the bel canto repertoire. Never mind, too, Norma\u2019s clandestine affair, which turns sour when she finds her feckless squeeze has fallen for one of her own temple \u201cvirgins\u201d: another day, another web of broken vows and deceit in the name of chastity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The two women pour their hearts out over the kitchen counter with children in earshot, one bouncing on a spacehopper</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This vivid but vague backdrop of religion and faith must take second place to Bellini\u2019s prime concern, the love triangle at the heart of the opera. The most fully developed relationship is that between the heroine and her rival in love, Adalgisa (Sonia Ganassi), with whom she also shares a bond of anger and despair. <a href=\"http://sonyayoncheva.com/en/news\">Yoncheva</a>, who replaced the originally announced Anna Netrebko several months ago in the title role, made a formidable job of her first effort. To say she has the makings of a great interpreter, following in the wake of Maria Callas or, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/07/norma-bartoli-australian-chamber-orchestra-at-edinburgh-festival-review\">last month in Edinburgh, Cecilia Bartoli</a>, is to diminish her achievements here. Yoncheva showed immense vocal control, offering variety of shading and dynamic as well as a daring coarseness.</p> <p>If this was because of any technical unevenness \u2013 reasonable enough in this nigh impossible role \u2013 it merely added to her convincing depiction of passion, haughtiness, fury and regret. Ganassi was warm-toned and sympathetic, excelling in her emotional Act 2 duet with Yoncheva, in which she pledges to abandon Pollione. There was potent authenticity to the sight of these two women pouring their hearts out over the kitchen counter with children in earshot, one bouncing on a spacehopper, unaware that their fate is being decided.</p> <p>The part of Pollione, ultimate two-dimensional love rat that he is, makes punishing demands on the tenor, who is required to appear, leap high vocally, then exit for a long time before doing more or less the same again. Calleja, making his role debut, has a bright, jabbing quality, snapping lines and phrases early in the urgency of the moment. In Act 1 he sounded worryingly out of sorts. He recovered to give a performance of requisite sheen and shine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"186a9cf46eb194df0ee844d1218728a0f69ac319\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/186a9cf46eb194df0ee844d1218728a0f69ac319/0_109_4757_2856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Potent authenticity\u2019: Sonya Yoncheva, second right, as Norma with Sonia Ganassi as Adalgisa and Matteo di Lorenzo and Niamh Worrell as the children.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Potent authenticity\u2019: Sonya Yoncheva, second right, as Norma with Sonia Ganassi as Adalgisa and Matteo di Lorenzo and Niamh Worrell as the children.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>David Junghoon Kim left a strong impression in the tiny role of Flavio, Pollione\u2019s friend. The well-drilled chorus showed the full force of a crowd in judgment. Oll\u00e9, and his design team of Alfons Flores (set), Lluc Castells (costumes) and Marco Filibeck (lighting), received a mix of cheers and boos.

Last week you could hear Var\u00e8se\u2019s <em>D\u00e9serts</em> with video by Bill Viola in the old Concorde hangar (now a <a href=\"http://www.nms.ac.uk/national-museum-of-flight/\">museum of flight</a>), a community performance of Britten\u2019s <em>Noye\u2019s Fludde</em> in Dunbar, or the music of Gesualdo in the huge parish church of Haddington.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf4f1333778e9347ddd958de39bdd73cd4e6f84c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf4f1333778e9347ddd958de39bdd73cd4e6f84c/0_0_2362_1575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Marian Consort with actor Gerald Kyd (centre) as Gesualdo at the Lammermuir festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Marian Consort with actor Gerald Kyd (centre) as Gesualdo at the Lammermuir festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robin Mitchell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was the venue, too, for the aurally spectacular opening event, the <a href=\"http://www.dunedin-consort.org.uk/\">Dunedin Consort</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hmsc.co.uk/\">Her Majesty\u2019s Sagbutts and Cornetts </a>in Monteverdi\u2019s Vespers 1610. Galleries in the church were used to recreate the all-round sound Monteverdi might have hoped for in this many-layered work. Small vocal and instrumental forces and a star lineup of soloists expert in this early 17th-century repertoire \u2013 Joshua Ellicott, Joanne Lunn, Esther Brazil and others who all deserve mention \u2013 performed electrifyingly under the penetrating guidance of the scholar-director John Butt. The serene, tugging beauty of Duo seraphim, sung from somewhere at the back of the church, hung disembodied in the air.</p> <p>In the same church, using the handsome, Lammermuir-made modern organ, William Whitehead gave a recital, mainly of Bach. Whitehead is curating a project to \u201ccomplete\u201d Bach\u2019s unfinished <a href=\"http://www.orgelbuechlein.co.uk/\">Orgelb\u00fcchlein</a>, or little organ book, commissioning international composers to contribute short chorale preludes to the 164 Bach intended to write (he stopped after 46). Two of the new preludes, by Jeremy Thurlow (b1976) and <a href=\"http://gabrieljackson.london/\">Gabriel Jackson</a> (b1962), the first jerky and exuberant, the second darker and full of conflict, were joined with a world premiere by<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/25/viola-theft-composer-sally-beamish-proms-merula-perpetua\"> Sally Beamish</a> (b1956). Her short, gracious prelude is based on Ach lieben Christen, seid Getrost (Ah, dear Christians, be comforted). The chorale theme is simply stated, then decorated with delicate counterpoint, ending in mid-air, as if in serenity and discord. This festival\u2019s subheading is \u201cbeautiful music, beautiful places\u201d. It fulfils its promise.</p> <p><em>Star ratings (out of 5)<br></em><em>Norma</em> \u2605\u2605\u2605<br><em>Lammermuir festival</em> \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/norma-by-alex-olle\">Norma is in rep at the Royal Opera House, London until 8 October</a>, and will be screened live in cinemas <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/showings/norma-live-2016\">on Monday 26 September </a> <br></p>",
  "<p>If you ask Gemma Arterton if she regrets her career choices to date, she will look you straight in the eye and tell you it\u2019s complicated. The year she graduated from Rada she appeared in Guy Ritchie\u2019s <em>RocknRolla</em>; in a Brit comedy with Mackenzie Crook; as the lead in <em>Tess of the D\u2019Urbervilles; </em>and as Bond girl Strawberry Fields in <em>Quantum of Solace</em>. From there, she went straight on to blockbusters <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time </em>and <em>Clash of the Titans</em>. On her first day working on <em>Quantum of Solace </em>she filmed her death scene, lying naked for two hours on Bond\u2019s bed, covered in black oil. It seems now that the experience gave her time to think.</p> <p>It\u2019s a hot afternoon in Soho and she is mixing a drink with the casual swing of someone just home from holidaying with her best friend; she\u2019s tanned, freckled, quick to laugh. At the weekend, for her belated 30th birthday party, she tells me she\u2019ll be performing TLC\u2019s \u201cNo Scrubs\u201d. Suddenly she\u2019s rapping. \u201cSee if you can\u2019t spatially expand my horizon. Then that leaves you in the class with scrubs, never rising\u2026\u201d And then my hands are clapping, because that\u2019s what happens to your hands when a girl spontaneously raps.</p> <p>We\u2019re at the <a href=\"http://www.deanstreettownhouse.com/\">Dean Street Townhouse</a> \u2013 and the sun has brought out celebrities like rain does snails. At every table is a doubletake. Arterton, her back to the room, seems profoundly at ease with herself, which makes her stories about the anger she suppressed \u2013 about her \u201cfreak-outs\u201d after bad experiences at work, about her decision to quit films altogether \u2013 all the more compelling.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjGkB_oWTe0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HjGkB_oWTe0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It happened slowly. Once, she remembers, she was working on a film where, apart from the make-up artist, she was the only woman on set. \u201cEveryone just behaved so badly, people were getting fired left, right and centre. It was just power, power, power.\u201d She hated it. \u201cAfter that, for a while I was doing \u2018Fuck You\u2019 work, because I was angry about the industry. I wanted to do these aggressive films to show that I was badass and could kill people.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wanted to do these aggressive films to show that I was badass and could kill people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 2010 she told <em>GQ</em> she wanted to work with directors \u201cwho respect me, who don\u2019t just see me as a piece of ass\u201d, a quote which people, including Simon Edge at the <em>Express,</em> took umbrage at, inviting a \u201cleading critic\u201d to respond: \u201cLet\u2019s face it, she\u2019s not getting the Hollywood big bucks because of her acting skills. As far as the studios are concerned she is basically a cheap bit of British totty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo then there was a point, about four years ago,\u201d she says, \u201cwhere I decided I couldn\u2019t do it any more.\u201d</p> <p>What is it to be an actor today? To be a star? Talent and skill aren\u2019t enough, nor is beauty, the ability to walk confidently from the sea in a bikini, or the ability to command a room. Nor good reviews. Nor an agent with claws. Your personality must be perfectly calibrated for a viral life. You must share the intimacies of your relationships and dinners online, and build a community of followers, rather than fans. Your quotes must be titillating, but not controversial, you must be at ease in both <em>Hamlet</em> and the <em>Mail Online</em>. Perhaps because she got thrown so far so fast \u2013 from a childhood in Gravesend with a welder dad and a cleaner mum, straight to Hollywood, Arterton is only now starting to take control.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"577b5b56cb39702e291e3770f83fe140001fdb03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/577b5b56cb39702e291e3770f83fe140001fdb03/240_0_642_774/415.jpg\" alt=\"Gemma Arterton in The Girl with All the Gifts.\" width=\"415\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A gun-wielding Miss Honey\u2019: in The Girl with All the Gifts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere was clearly a point where she appeared to take a deep breath,\u201d says film writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dannyleigh\">Danny Leigh</a>. She\u2019d done <em>Prince of Persia</em>, <em>Byzantium </em>and <em>Hansel &amp; Gretel</em>: \u201cPretty dire films, probably pretty thankless experiences, and good examples of the assault course a young British actor has to contend with. But specifically, a working-class actor.\u201d</p> <p>While actors like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/keiraknightley\">Keira Knightley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/carey-mulligan\">Carey Mulligan</a> stepped straight into serious cinema, Arterton debuted in <em>St Trinian\u2019s</em>. \u201cYoung, working-class British actors get funnelled either into soaps or TV drama or, if they make it into films at all, a very specific kind of social realism,\u201d says Leigh. \u201cCulturally they\u2019re seen as not having quite the dramatic heft or range of their middle-class peers. It also feels like it\u2019s somehow more acceptable to treat them as sex objects.\u201d</p> <p>Arterton then, though successful, was seen as \u201cchirpy\u201d and \u201cperky\u201d, \u201cand all those other grim clich\u00e9s about working-class young women\u201d, says Leigh. \u201cAnd it takes a very brave director to up-end that public persona.\u201d It\u2019s interesting, he adds, to look at the films she <em>didn\u2019t</em> do \u2013 especially <em>Under the Skin</em>, a film she was dumped from in favour of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/scarlettjohansson\">Scarlett Johansson</a>. Instead of the serious drama <em>Suffragette</em>, she was in the musical of <em>Made in Dagenham</em>. \u201cAnd one of the awkward things about <em>Suffragette</em> was it clearly aspired to be about the experience of working-class women, but then cast a middle-class actor to do it. I can see that same script with Gemma Arterton in the lead role, and I actually think it would have felt much more eloquent and true,\u201d he says. \u201cShe strikes me as far more intelligent than she\u2019s been allowed to be.\u201d</p> <p>Across the table, Arterton\u2019s accent slips endearingly between posh and not, and she talks with her hands about time passing. In 2010 she married Italian businessman Stefano Catelli. In 2015 she divorced him. She turned down parts, she learned French. It wasn\u2019t until Arterton realised there was another career to be had, where she didn\u2019t have to continue on a path paved with naked corpses, that she returned to film. Smaller films.

It was part of a bigger conversation, where women started sharing their stories on social media and in places like the <a href=\"http://everydaysexism.com/\">Everyday Sexism</a> project \u2013 a shift away from that accepting, heavy silence.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the question about regret is complicated. Ten years ago, when she was propelled from drama student to star (or \u201ccheap British totty\u201d), Arterton knows she wouldn\u2019t have lasted long if she\u2019d been as outspoken as she is today.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a different time, and not just for me,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I started talking about how I didn\u2019t enjoy parts of my job, and talking about body image, I got in trouble. So I stopped.\u201d</p> <p>But the more crap she saw, the more she felt dismissed, objectified, angry, the more she felt she had to speak out. And today, as she begins to produce her own projects, concentrate on theatre (later this year she takes on the notoriously difficult <em>Saint Joan</em> at the <a href=\"http://www.donmarwarehouse.com/#BSVY2u3kjXugMXBJ.97\">Donmar Warehouse</a>), and turn down big-budget, arm-candy roles, she believes that journey, those shocks, were necessary for her to end up with a career she\u2019s proud of.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier to conform and shut up. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s always been with women. Easier than putting yourself out there and having an opinion, to which someone might retaliate. I\u2019m sure there are people who don\u2019t want to work with me because they think I\u2019m difficult \u2013 \u2018one of those feminist girls\u2019 \u2013 but to be honest with you I don\u2019t want to work with them. And that\u2019s fine. Now.\u201d</p> <p>She finishes her drink. \u201cA revolution is happening, but in its own quiet English way, because people work fucking hard, and it\u2019s hard to live, and everyone\u2019s had enough of being fucked over.

At one point in the film, the girl asks Considine why humans get to live, while the zombie \u201chungries\u201d have to die. Is it just because the humans got here first?

It\u2019s called <em>The Escape</em>. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/dominic-cooper\">Dominic Cooper</a> plays my husband.

  "<p>There were certain things in her long life that Elizabeth Jane Howard (1923-2014) couldn\u2019t help, such as an unsupportive mother, an abusive father, a propensity for illness, a chronic shyness, and a posh background (used as a stick to beat her with by her third husband). These ordeals found their way into a body of work that would in time become one of the most beloved in 20th-century English fiction. She knew suffering, and transformed it. Yet her most defining characteristic could not entirely be blamed on the stars. Howard was in her mid-50s when she met a therapist who told her, \u201cYou are a bottomless pit of neediness\u201d, and suddenly the life that Artemis Cooper has been recounting in this hugely absorbing biography falls into place \u2013&#xa0;almost every romantic misfortune in&#xa0;it&#xa0;explained.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/05/elizabeth-jane-howard-appreciation-obituary\">Elizabeth Jane Howard, 1923-2014: an appreciation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Readers of Howard\u2019s 2002 memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/nov/10/biography.classics\" title=\"\"><em>Slipstream</em></a><em>,</em> will already know many of the stories here, though they do bear repetition. Hers was a very English, upper-middle-class existence with privilege and privation in a constant struggle. Jane (as Cooper, a family friend, names her throughout) had nannies and riding lessons and nice holidays, but she was starved of love by her \u201covercritical\u201d mother and couldn\u2019t trust her sexually incontinent father. While early ambitions to be an actress came to nothing, her rangy beauty and impeccable breeding seemed to guarantee her stock in the marriage market. Peter Scott, son of the late polar explorer, was a naval hero and a painter whose indifferent courtship of Jane nevertheless ended in matrimony. His formidable mother, Kathleen, issued a warning to the young bride: \u201cIf you ever made Pete unhappy I should want to stab you. I should enjoy doing it.\u201d The union produced a daughter, Nicola \u2013 her only child \u2013 and a fair amount of unhappiness before Jane walked out, unstabbed though not unscathed.</p> <p>The 1950s began in high promise with the publication of her first novel, <em>The Beautiful Visit</em>, whose central theme would touch a chord with at least half of the reading public: How does a woman find her place in the world when she has been brought up unprepared for anything but marriage? Freed from one calamity, Jane would hurl herself into another, usually an ill-advised liaison with a married man. In 1955 alone she had affairs with Laurie Lee, Arthur Koestler and Romain Gary. A flingette with Ken Tynan lasted up to the point at which his wife returned from a sojourn in the US. More serious was her affair with Cecil Day-Lewis, for the betrayed wife was Jane\u2019s good friend Jill Balcon; not surprisingly, it soured their relationship for years. Her second novel, <em>The Long Viewcorrect</em>, with its daring backwards structure, powerfully dramatised the decades-long torment of an unequal marriage. And here is the mystery of Jane Howard: the writer was so much wiser than the woman. She understood in her fiction what she failed (and kept on failing) to grasp in her life. It was a neediness that surrendered too much ground to men: as Cooper puts it, \u201cshe was watching herself through their eyes, not looking at them\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b039a8aa76dae017caba0bf1fee20f0a16416a95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b039a8aa76dae017caba0bf1fee20f0a16416a95/171_495_2533_3166/800.jpg\" alt=\"Writer Elizabeth Jane Howard in 2003.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elizabeth Jane Howard in Edinburgh in 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This ominous insight prepares the way for the most significant relationship of her life, and the most riveting pages of this biography. To contrast the optimism of her early days with Kingsley Amis to the end of their marriage 18 years later is almost as painful here as it was in <em>Slipstream</em>. However much Amis belittled their time together afterwards, the evidence of his first letters to Jane (\u201cunlike any other letters of his I have seen\u201d, wrote his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/may/07/biography.kingsleyamis1\" title=\"\">biographer Zachary Leader</a>) suggest that if ever two people were passionately in love, these two were. Again, those who have read the Leader book and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jun/05/martinamis\" title=\"\">Martin Amis\u2019s <em>Experience</em></a> will know what\u2019s to come and yet still be amazed \u2013 and horrified \u2013 by scenes of domestic masochism on one side and boorish egotism on the other. Drink played its part in their downfall, though it doesn\u2019t wholly explain why Jane could start out as Kingsley\u2019s lover and intellectual companion only to become, practically speaking, his drudge, cook and chauffeur. (And shameless nepotist: as a judge on the <a href=\"http://themanbookerprize.com/fiction/1974\" title=\"\">1974 Booker prize</a> she argued for her husband\u2019s <em>Ending Up</em> to win.) There is nothing sadder here than the moment, towards the bitter end, when Jane is standing at her bedroom window and Kingsley comes up, puts his arms around her and says: \u201cI used to be so much in love with you.\u201d</p> <p>Her exit from the marriage left Jane in a torment of loneliness. It caused one final astonishing reversal years later, when a mysterious admirer insinuated himself into her life (the episode is recast in her late novel <em>Falling</em>). Only by the shrewdness of her daughter, Nicola, who conducted background checks, was the interloper eventually unmasked as a con man. One might say (cruelly) that there\u2019s no fool like an old fool \u2013 Jane was 73 at the time \u2013 yet her self-delusion shows a lifelong consistency. While she knew the danger of rushing into a romance, she was unwilling, or unable, to learn from past mistakes. Will the novels endure? As Cooper observes, her work has overtaken Amis\u2019s in popularity; the Cazalet chronicles have developed from a cult following into a national treasure. It is a kind of posthumous revenge, though one wonders if Jane Howard would have traded it for a little more happiness in her earthly span.</p> <p><em>Elizabeth Jane Howard: A Dangerous Innocence is published by John Murray (\u00a325). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/elizabeth-jane-howard.html\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a320.50</em></a></p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s been a pretty static summer on the circulation and readership front. Quality papers \u2013 in print and online \u2013 doing well in the referendum aftermath, with the tabloids staging a modest August recovery. But there\u2019s one fascinating result being celebrated by traditional US news hawks. For the first time in modern digital history (as recorded by comScore over July), the <em>New York Times</em> and the <em>Washington Post </em>both beat starry startups BuzzFeed and the <em>Huffington Post</em>. The <em>Times</em> and <em>Post </em>were up 41% and 54% year-on-year \u2013 while the opposition dropped back.</p> <p>As Ken Doctor at the Nieman Journalism Lab notes, it\u2019s not just a question of readers wanting their news from sturdier, familiar sources in the eye of a presidential election storm. There\u2019s the question of if and when shooting stars begin to wane. \u201cHas the <em>Huffington Post</em>, which shed 12m unique visitors in just a year \u2013 and a time of incredible political ferment \u2013 peaked? After all, it was born at another digital time, 2005 \u2026 a business/editorial model of aggregation ahead of its time.\u201d</p> <p>Now, minus founder Arianna, the HuffPo \u201cmust look of how to redefine its very identity\u201d.</p> <p>BuzzFeed, meanwhile, \u201chas confused many by announcing it is to split into news and entertainment parts\u201d, Doctor adds. \u201cThat move has still not been well explained in intent or impact on its journalism. What the data does show is that BuzzFeed, too, lost 10m unique visitors over the last year.\u201d</p> <p>No one quite knows what this means on the bottom line, but momentum is vital to keep startup investors happy, so any glitch comes with costs attached. it\u2019s rough for all the rivals.</p> <p>\u25a0 Legacy victory No 2, duly celebrated by Poynter Institute researchers. We\u2019ve discovered that digital tablets haven\u2019t obliterated dear old printed books: and that print resilience remains strong. The average American reads 12 books a year. The percentage of Americans reading at least one book is 73%, pretty proximate to 2012\u2019s 74%. Some 65% of US readers prefer reading printed pages \u2013 the same as in 2012. Ebooks have spurted upwards, with 28% reading at least one digital page-turner a year; but 38% still read only in print \u2013 and 28% mix and match. In short, any transition is glacial by modern digital standards; and may even be reaching a plateau.</p>",
  "<p><strong>How wise are you? Unlike its flashier cousin intelligence, the concept of wisdom has been virtually ignored by scientists, perhaps because nobody can quite put their finger on exactly what wisdom is. But recently this has started to change, to the point where you can now measure your wisdom by answering a few simple questions. </strong></p> <p><strong>First, take a few moments to think over a recent negative incident involving another person. Now, on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), to what extent do you feel that\u2026</strong></p> <p>(a) In order to understand the incident, I need to have detailed information about the exact circumstances of the incident (\u201cintellectual humility\u201d).</p> <p>(b) As I thought about the incident, I saw it more from the perspective of an onlooker than through my own eyes (\u201cself-transendence\u201d).</p> <p>(c) I am now more able to understand the other person\u2019s point of view, and even to sacrifice my own interests in order to avoid damaging my relationship with this person (\u201cother perspectives and compromise\u201d).</p> <p>The higher your score, the wiser you are. A recent study found that wisdom varies not only from person to person, but from day to day within individuals. When people took a \u201cwise\u201d perspective on negative events, they were not only more forgiving to others, but better able to control their own emotions and less adversely affected by the event. So next time somebody winds you up, don\u2019t rise to it \u2013 get wise to it. </p> <p><em>A fully referenced version of this article is available at </em><a href=\"http://pcwww.liv.ac.uk/~ambridge/links.htm\"><em>benambridge.com</em></a><em>.

For if my job has taught me anything, it is this: certain ingredients can deliver as much of a kick coming out as they did going in. A few years back one of my so-called rivals concluded a review of an especially spicy Sichuan place with the instruction to put the wet wipes in the fridge overnight. I am wishing now that I had recalled the advice a good 12 hours earlier.</p> <p>And yet I do not regret a second of my meal at <a href=\"http://www.somsaa.com/\">Som Saa</a>. Some eating experiences reveal their virtues like courtroom dramas, the evidence in support of the case building slowly. Others are like romances, the true loving emotion presenting itself in gentle, soothing waves. Dinner at Som Saa \u2013 it\u2019s the name of a Thai fruit, apparently \u2013 is neither of these. It\u2019s an action movie full of crash, bang and wallop. It\u2019s the friendliest slap around the chops; a throw-you-back-in-your-seat ride which draws you in and spits you out again at the end gasping and, if you\u2019re me, with your collar drenched. In response to chilli I break out in a sweat. At the finish I looked like I\u2019d taken a shower.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cdcab3ba8808882e256be650c83a6bacfde12140\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdcab3ba8808882e256be650c83a6bacfde12140/0_244_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A whole sea bass, curving on a plate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Buried under drifts of foliage and smokey chillies\u2019: sea bass.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Som Saa started life last year as a Thai food pop-up in a filthy east London railway arch, but I didn\u2019t go. Too many pop-ups are people playing at grown-up restaurants, and who knows whether they\u2019ll ever be heard of again? This one, however, was clearly a proof of concept. The chefs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/22/chefs-who-are-loosening-the-old-school-thai\">Mark Dobbie</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/10/som-saa-london-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin\">Andy Oliver</a>, cut their teeth with Thai food oracle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/sep/19/david-thompson-thai-recipes\">David Thompson</a>. Oliver later worked in a renowned Bangkok restaurant. Their partner front of house is Tom George, with experience at Hawksmoor and with the Polpo Group, which have together written the textbook on what modern, relaxed restaurant service should look like.</p> <p>So here they now are, following a crowd-funding campaign, located in a former fabrics warehouse just south of Spitalfields market. Naturally they don\u2019t take bookings, unless for tables of four or more. I thought of inventing a couple of friends I would later mislay so I could reserve, but decided in the end to be a good boy and queue at the bar.</p> <p>I\u2019m glad I did, because the bar snacks are shamelessly, raucously, look-at-me brilliant. There are addictive bowls of toasted cashews with chilli and kaffir lime leaves, practically smoking in the dish in front of you. Better still is the jan naem \u2013 minced pork which has been fermented for four days with garlic and rice until it reaches a meaty lactic sourness. It\u2019s then pressed with fresh chillies and grilled. It is one of the best things ever done to the minced end of a pig.

There are metal girders and high ceilings just to make sure the clamour echoes properly. At one point I joked that I was the oldest man in the room. Then I looked about and realised that I really was the oldest man there. Oh, for the sweet, untroubled hearing of the young.</p> <p>But again, for this food, I\u2019ll take the battering. Abandon any expectations encouraged by the tooth-achingly sweet offerings in Anglo-Thai restaurants. As this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/22/chefs-who-are-loosening-the-old-school-thai\">magazine reported a couple of months back</a>, there\u2019s a new take on Thai food gaining purchase in Britain right now and it\u2019s a green curry-free zone. The food wanders restlessly from north to south. It is a deliriously fearsome bash of fire and sour and salt and smoke; of the high ethereal waft of Thai basil and lemongrass, of mint and coriander and pungent fish sauces, and their own coconut creams to lend soothing depths where needed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4d578c3cda3e136ca79b399f4f381e78bec008fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d578c3cda3e136ca79b399f4f381e78bec008fd/516_433_4893_2936/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Duck soup: a shallow white bowl with green leaves and red chillies with a ladle on the edge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018All hot and sour loveliness\u2019: duck soup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the specials board is a duck soup, complete with the offals.

It\u2019s buried under drifts of foliage and smokey chillies, the crunch of toasted rice and the intensity of more fish sauce. From the same section headed simply \u201cwok\u201d comes a perfect mess of crisp-roasted belly pork with sliced snake beans in a thick, dry red curry that shouts at you and shouts at you again until you have spooned up every last smear. The only step on to almost familiar ground is a slightly sweeter Penang curry of salted beef cheeks, cooked until spoonable, which with its dollop of coconut has edges of a massaman about it, but with more serious and savoury intent. Note: don\u2019t drop these down your shirt, or your clothes will recall your dinner for as long as you do.</p> <p>A salad of prawn, pork, peanuts and Asian pennywort, dressed with glugs of lime juice and \u2013 but of course \u2013 more fish sauce, is like a breath of cool air after hours in the sun.

  "<p>Today it\u2019s bad to be good. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/bad-moms\"><em>Bad Moms</em></a>, a film about the impossible expectations of parenting by the people who did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-hangover\"><em>The Hangover</em></a>, has been a massive summer hit. You can understand why \u2013 mothers want to see their lives represented, and as a demographic they\u2019re being massively underserved. A new report shows that only 35% of the characters in Hollywood films and shows last year were over-40, with 80% of those older people in films being men. (The year she turned 41, Meryl Streep said she was offered three roles \u2014 all to play witches.) But the premise of <em>Bad Moms </em>\u2013 three drinky, shaggy mothers revel in their inadequacy, and gang up against the bullying mum who runs the PTA \u2013 while having the smell of something empowering and fresh relies, of course, on mothers being pitted against each other, relies on that self-perpetuating culture of rivalry, relies on the ancient bones of our own insecurities. Which is funny, until you leave the cinema.</p> <p>Elsewhere, a new brand called <a href=\"http://www.selfishmother.com/\">Selfish Mother</a> sells its \u201cWinging It\u201d T-shirts at John Lewis, and what once seemed to be a quietly shocking statement of rebellion, is now\u2026 normal. The bad mum has never been more fashionable. The pilot for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/07/motherland-review-a-terrifying-no-holds-barred-glimpse-into-parenthood\"><em>Motherland</em></a>, the brilliant new BBC sitcom by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/sharon-horgan\">Sharon Horgan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/jul/07/graham-linehan-ladykillers-play-father-ted\">Graham Linehan</a>, takes place in the hazy half-light of a half-term holiday, when a woman must call on the wonky kindness of strange mums to help with her kids. The other women are passive-aggressive and perfect, the very opposite of our broken heroine. In a spotless basement kitchen the differences between good and bad mums are illustrated by such sports as whipping up a quick bolognese for 10, and chopping a finger off while cutting frozen cheese. The children are just noise in the background \u2013 the mothers are the focus, and none of them are OK, even if their hair looks amazing.</p> <p>Which is the thing, isn\u2019t it. By the time we get here, to independent adulthood and bags for life and cats, we have learned that even if a person looks like they\u2019re cool and coping, they too are human, and are dealing with the agonies that make us whole. On screen these domestic wars are fought with screams and cake thrown \u2013 in real life they\u2019re fought inside our heads.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>it\u2019s tempting to see cupcake bakers and yoga retreaters as rivals</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Like being \u201cgood\u201d, being bad is only quantifiable when compared with other\u2019s efforts, and it\u2019s tempting to see the cupcake bakers and yoga retreaters as rivals because they make us feel like losers, never more so than when all educational achievements are stripped away and all you have to show for yourself is a half-dressed four-year-old covered in ketchup. But while there are, no doubt, some women who find responsibilities a breeze, there are surely more who, while appearing to succeed, are trying really hard to find a semblance of order in their wind-strewn lives.</p> <p>To be bad means to have depth. So, to be good is to be seen as shallow. It\u2019s one thing to say \u201cembrace your badness\u201d, another to say that if you look like nothing hurts then you\u2019re lying. Our modern woman-ness sometimes seems to be built on competitive honesty and an insistence that we are failing; self-deprecating as if it was an Olympic sport, with medals. All our long lives, from those side-eyed conversations in the playground to NCT teas and PTA meetings, we\u2019ve trained ourselves to smell out difference, and attack it, however sneakily. There is us, and there is them. Today, you and me, we\u2019re a bit shoddy, we\u2019re chaotic, anxious, dry-skinned, crap. You see us narrating modern literature, feeling bad about our necks, getting drunk, doing bawdy stand-up about our vaginas.
