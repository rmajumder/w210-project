  "<p>More than 330 shops, takeaways, tattoo parlours, petrol stations and newsagents have stopped selling formerly legal highs three months after the blanket ban on novel psychoactive substances, according to newly released Home Office figures.</p> <p>Police forces across England and Wales report they have arrested 186 alleged offenders involved in the trade in the substances, and 24 head shops have closed down altogether since the blanket ban came into effect on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/05/blanket-ban-on-legal-highs-england-wales-begin-26-may\">26 May</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p> The term novel psychoactive substances covers a wide range of chemicals that mimic the effects of traditional illicit drugs and include nitrous oxide (laughing gas) canisters, which have been popular at festivals. They are often sold under brand names such as Clockwork Orange, Bliss and Mary Jane as a lucrative sideline by high-street retailers. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/31/ban-legal-highs-drug-related-deaths-alcohol\">This ban on legal highs will only have one effect: more drug-related deaths | David Nutt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Commander Simon Bray, the National Police Chiefs Council lead for psychoactive substances, said: \u201cThe significant reduction in the number of head shops and retailers stocking psychoactive substances in just three months demonstrates the hard work of officers across the country in getting these harmful drugs off the market. It is still early days but the police enforcement approach combined with education and support services for users is helping to reduce the damage that misuse of these substances can cause in communities.\u201d</p> <p>The action by police forces aimed at shops and small retailers has been backed up by action by the National Crime Agency to shut down websites found to be in breach of the blanket ban. It is also working with international police forces to tackle websites based overseas selling into the UK. More than 120 UK-based websites were involved in the trade when it was legal.<br></p> <p>An official impact assessment produced during the passage of the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016 through parliament estimated there were 450 businesses in Britain for whom the trade in formerly legal highs was a major component of their turnover. The Home Office estimated the ban could cost them \u00a332m annually in lost profit. Officials said there were a further 210 additional small scale sellers who regarded trade in the substances as a lucrative sideline.</p> <p>A decision by 308 shops to stop selling legal highs and the closure of a further 28 head shops means that about half the physical outlets have left the business within the first three months of the blanket ban.</p> <p>The new legislation gives the police powers to issue prohibition and premises orders allowing them to shut down head shops and online dealers, with up to two years in prison for those who fail to comply. Those directly involved in supplying, importing, or producing legal highs can face prison sentences of up to seven years. Individual possession of legal highs is not a criminal offence under the legislation.<br></p> <p>In one case, South Wales police arrested a man at a Cardiff music festival on suspicion of possessing psychoactive substances with intent to supply, after 144 canisters of nitrous oxide were discovered.</p> <p>Danny Kushlick of <a href=\"http://www.tdpf.org.uk/\">Transform</a>, the drugs policy campaign, said: \u201cThe act itself was only ever intended to stop visible sales, so politicians have their visible PR success, but the market will simply shift to unregulated street and online sales. It has, in the main, done just that. The ban has only served to drive the trade underground, increasing health harms and criminality.\u201d</p> <p>But Home Office minister Sarah Newton said she was encouraged to see that after only three months the police were using their new powers to take dealers off the streets and that so many retailers had been denied the opportunity to profit from the trade. \u201cThe Psychoactive Substances Act is sending out a clear message: this government will take whatever action is necessary to keep our families and communities safe. These drugs are not legal, they are not safe and we will not allow them to be sold in this country,\u201d she said.</p>",

Showsec was the only provider to have bid for the contract.</p> <p>G4S has now said it will not step in to provide security, even if the party\u2019s executive drops its boycott of the company.</p> <p>Eric Alexander, managing director for G4S events, said the company would usually start planning for such a large and complex event up to a year in advance. \u201cSafety for delegates and our staff is our priority and at this late stage and with our teams committed elsewhere, we are not in a position to step in and provide security for the conference,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cSecurity officers need to be cleared and accredited to work, detailed risk assessments made, safety and security plans with the Home Office and local police forces drawn up and supporting logistics, such as security equipment and staff accommodation, put in place.</p> <p>\u201cOur team of more than 100 security staff has secured the Labour party\u2019s annual conference for over 20 years and the feedback from officials and the police on our work last year, as in the past, was extremely positive. Clearly we were disappointed not to continue such a successful working relationship.\u201d</p> <p>Although it is possible for the party to pay police officers to secure the event, Merseyside police said it is \u201cnot an option at the moment\u201d and that they have not yet been approached by the party.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s general secretary, Iain McNicol, emailed members of the NEC to ask for input on the situation, and several are known to have recommended that the party retract its boycott of G4S, which does recognise trade unions.</p> <p>The boss of GMB, Tim Roache, has said the union will picket the conference if Showsec provides the security, leaving Labour MPs and members facing the choice of crossing a picket line to attend their own conference or missing the event entirely. Sources have told the Guardian such a scenario would make it impossible for it to go ahead.</p> <p>As Labour staff and the NEC race to find a solution to the security crisis, officials also came under attack from McDonnell who accused them of trying to weed out Corbyn voters in a strongly worded statement sent out by the leader\u2019s campaign team.</p> <p>The accusations of a purge were prompted by the suspension of a senior Corbyn-supporting trade unionist, Ronnie Draper, general secretary of the <a href=\"http://www.bfawu.org/\">Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union</a>.</p> <p>McDonnell said: \u201cLabour party members will not accept what appears to be a rigged purge of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Jeremy Corbyn</a> supporters. The conduct of this election must be fair and even-handed.\u201d</p> <p>He said he had written to McNicol \u201cto demand that members and supporters who are suspended or lose their voting rights are given clear information about why action has been taken and a timely opportunity to challenge the decision\u201d.</p> <p>McDonnell claimed the party was exercising double standards in suspending Draper while allowing long-time party donor Lord Sainsbury to remain a member, despite the peer having given more than \u00a32m to the Liberal Democrats.</p> <p>The compliance unit is working through applications to check whether the 180,000 new registered supporters who signed up to take part in the vote are eligible, or if some are members of, or public advocates for, other groups.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> said the party did not discuss national executive committee decisions on individual members. Several other would-be Labour members have taken to Twitter to complain of being denied membership because they had expressed support for other parties, including the Greens.</p> <p>Jonny Will Chambers, the former parliamentary assistant to MP Stella Creasy, also said that he had had his membership denied because of tweets in support of Theresa May when she was standing for Conservative party leader.</p> <p>Members of the NEC, who sit on two separate vetting panels with three members each, have the final say over whether an application for membership is denied and the decision is made by majority vote not by individuals.</p> <p>Outgoing NEC member Johanna Baxter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohannaBaxter?lang=en\">tweeted on Thursda</a>y that the panels were made up both of Corbyn supporters and supporters of his rival, Owen Smith, but said she had received internet abuse for being on one of the panels.<br></p>",

  "<p>Mark Wood feels his pace is now more consistent than ever before and, while thoughts about the speed gun do not enter his head during the process of propelling a cricket ball over 90mph, the England fast bowler fancies he can go quicker still.</p> <p>Wednesday\u2019s rain-affected one-day victory over Pakistan in Southampton was the 26-year-old\u2019s first cap in nine months, having missed the first half of the season due to ankle surgery in November and then April that \u2013 touch wood \u2013 appear to have addressed the chronic pain at both the front and back of his left ankle that cut short his breakthrough season last October.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/24/england-pakistan-first-odi-match-report\">England get better of the rain breaks to beat Pakistan on D/L method</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is nothing quite like pace on the ball to get an audience buzzing, be it in the ground or at home, and, although Wood\u2019s figures of one for 57 from 10 overs in his comeback do not jump off the scorebook, the thrill of seeing a fast bowler roaring in and touching 93mph goes beyond the numbers, even if Sharjeel Khan, who feathered behind trying to pull one such exocet, may not share this sentiment.</p> <p>Having been back bowling for a month and fresh from lighting up T20 Finals Day last Saturday \u2013 his four wickets helped Durham fell Yorkshire in their semi-final, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/20/durham-northampton-natwest-t20-blast-final-match-report\" title=\"\">only for Northamptonshire to prove a game too far</a> \u2013 Wood is in a buoyant mood at present, tempered only by an awareness that two three-wicket hauls prior to his extended lay-off represent his best returns from 17 international games.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s great to be back in the team; it\u2019s nice to be bowling quick but ultimately I\u2019ll be judged on wickets,\u201d said Wood after England\u2019s victory by 44 on Duckworth-Lewis. \u201cI had more than a little bit of frustration over the last few months, so to come back so strongly is amazing. My head coach at Durham, Jon Lewis, and the whole England medical team, deserve huge credit.\u201d</p> <p>Asked whether he is now quicker than before his two operations, Wood replied: \u201cI would say consistently quicker. I wouldn\u2019t say quicker in terms of my top speed but I have not got the pain in the back of my ankle which was causing me huge problems. People were saying I could not play back-to-back games but it wasn\u2019t that, more that I couldn\u2019t bowl at 90mph every day \u2013 and I am a totally different bowler bowling 90mph from when I am bowling 80mph.\u201d</p> <p>Pace, however, is not something that actively crosses Wood\u2019s mind at the top of his mark, rather skill and hostility. \u201cThe analyst guy gets pretty worked up when I come back into the dressing room \u2013 \u201cyou bowled 92\u201d \u2013 so he lets me know. But when I\u2019m bowling, I\u2019m not thinking about how quick I\u2019m trying to bowl. It\u2019s either a plan or trying to knock someone\u2019s head off.\u201d</p> <p>Can he go faster still? \u201cI reckon I could, yeah. I\u2019ve been rushed back through to get some game time, having missed the first half of the summer, and I\u2019ve been desperate to play. I\u2019ve played only two Championship games and in one of those I bowled only 14 overs so, if I get that match-fitness back up, hopefully I can bowl even quicker.\u201d</p> <p>Such speeds, generated from his short, sprinter\u2019s run-up through to his explosion at the crease, still needs harnessing, of course, and it is in this regard the England management are impressed by Wood\u2019s hunger to learn and his progress to date, given that fitness issues have meant his career remains in its infancy in terms of matches played.</p> <p>The player himself hopes this promise results in a second central contract in September, upon which his future at Durham could hinge; no deal from England may see the cash-strapped county unable to retain his services, a situation Wood hopes will not come to pass.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt\u2019s complicated off the field at Durham and everyone knows there are issues there. I love the north-east, I\u2019m a north-east lad. Am I confident of a central contract? I wouldn\u2019t say so. Because I\u2019ve not played for England for a long time I probably haven\u2019t deserved to get another one. But I know that part of the reason that they give them out is to look after fast bowlers. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see. I\u2019m focusing on England at the moment and I\u2019ll see what happens there come September.\u201d</p> <p>His England one-day captain, Eoin Morgan, when asked before the series about Wood, was quick to talk up the talents of Liam Plunkett \u2013 another to nudge above the hallowed 90mph mark during Pakistan\u2019s innings \u2013 and with Chris Woakes the slipperiest Englishman on show during the Test summer, and Ben Stokes straining at the leash to bowl after a calf problem, it is hard to think of a speedier set during Morgan\u2019s 18 months in charge. Come Twenty20 time, there is the option of the Sussex left-armer Tymal Mills, too.</p> <p>Lord\u2019s on Saturday is next up for Morgan\u2019s side who, judging by the first fixture, already appear to have greater power through their batting line-up than Pakistan to go with this stable of quicks. The tourists need to find answers soon or the series could be over fast.</p>",

  "<p>A prominent campaigner for increased consumer rights for punters has offered a cautious welcome to a new player in the crowded internet gambling market: a bookmaking site that claims it will not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/jul/12/mark-johnston-itv-horse-racing-ditches-betting-news\" title=\"\">ban or restrict its customers for winning</a>, and will guarantee to lay any price to lose at least \u00a3500.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s positive that an online bookmaker is trying to trade in a traditional way,\u201d Brian Chappell, the founder of the website justiceforpunters.org, said on Thursday. \u201cThis type of approach, if it continues, will certainly be welcomed by most punters, especially the thousands who have their bets restricted to pennies by the major players.\u201d</p> <p>Shareholders in Black Type Bet, which launched on Wednesday, include Mylo Sangster, the grandson of the famous owner-breeder Robert, whose blue and green silks were among the most famous of the last 50 years. The new firm is seeking a niche in a highly-competitive market which has seen a number of bookies come and go in recent years, on occasions taking their customers\u2019 deposits with them, but Black Type is staking its claim to be different on a willingness to lay bets at advertised prices.</p> <p>A bookie that accepts your money might not sound revolutionary but in recent years increasing numbers of online gamblers have suffered the frustration of attempting to place bets on racing and sport with major firms, only to find their stakes restricted to tiny amounts, or refused altogether.</p> <p>The Horserace Bettors Forum, a group launched by the British Horseracing Authority to represent the interests of racing punters, also recently claimed at least 20,000 accounts were closed by bookmakers in the first six months of 2016. This, according to Simon Rowlands, the HBF\u2019s chairman, raised fears that \u201cthe appeal of betting on horse racing is possibly being seriously eroded by the trading practices of individual bookmakers.\u201d</p> <p>Black Type is adamant that it will not close winning accounts, with the sole caveat that customers using computer programmes to \u201carb\u201d bets via betting exchanges \u2013 that is, take a price on their site and lay it on an exchange for a small, guaranteed profit \u2013 will be barred on a \u201cthree-strikes-and-out\u201d basis. There are no gaming products \u2013 such as virtual slot machines and roulette \u2013 on the site, and Stephen Davison, a spokesman for the company, said its promise to lay its prices to lose at least \u00a3500 is cast iron.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s there on the site in big letters and there\u2019s no hiding away from it,\u201d Davison said. \u201cThis is not a project that\u2019s been built up overnight.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re after day-to-day \u00a320 each-ways, \u00a350 to win and \u00a31 Lucky 15s, and there are plenty of punters like that out there who are disillusioned because they\u2019ve won a bit somewhere and been closed, or they\u2019ve backed something at 12-1 that\u2019s gone off at 6-1 and the bookie has decided they don\u2019t want their business.\u201d</p> <p>To maintain its margins, Black Type will not offer the \u201cBest Odds Guaranteed\u201d concession on racing that is widespread among major firms, or offer inflated odds or free bets to new customers. It is, in a sense, an attempt to return to traditional bookmaking practices in the internet age, and only time will tell how successful that can be.</p> <p>Chappell, a fierce and persistent critic of bookmakers on the issue of restrictions and account closures, is one of many who will watch with interest. He also points out that the Australian state of New South Wales introduced legislation in January 2015 which forces bookies to honour guarantees on the minimum bets they will lay, and that a number of firms have seen their turnover and profitability rise as a result.</p> <p>He would like to see the Gambling Commission, which regulates the industry in Britain, introduce equivalent rules for bookies trading in the United Kingdom. \u201cAt the moment, bookmakers are advertising prices but they are discriminating,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a few people, as they claim. It\u2019s thousands and thousands of people.\u201d</p>",

The problem was taking them. This was a difficult evening for Jonathan Calleri, the Argentinian forward who spurned two glorious opportunities, and West Ham found Lung in defiant form.</p> <p>Yet, frantically as West Ham searched for that elusive goal, what really frustrated Bilic was that they played as individuals.

How does he feel about his successor as skipper, No8 Kieran Read, taking one of his All Black records? </p> <p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I hope that it is a bit closer, because you don\u2019t want one-sided results for the top teams.

It was his fourth yellow in an All Black shirt. McCaw, <a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/all-blacks/72255714/richie-mccaw-is-illdisciplined--the-stats-prove-it\">infamously to some</a>, given his reputation as supreme scavenger and spoiler of the breakdown, only ever had three. He laughs. \u201cInteresting. He can have that one.\u201d</p> <p>McCaw is in New York to work one job in a post-playing portfolio that also includes flying and promoting Christchurch Helicopters and representing Fonterra, a New Zealand dairy conglomerate. He has signed autographs, pressed the flesh, spoken to local media. AIG staffers click iPhones into VR headsets and immerse themselves in Haka360, a gizmo the insurance giant put out before the World Cup last year. The roars of Ka Mate echo out over the rolling East River. \u201cIt\u2019s making me a little nauseous,\u201d says one woman, giggling.</p> <p>Back in Chicago, I asked McCaw if impending retirement made him a little queasy. He said it didn\u2019t, really, but then retreated a little bit, describing how former team-mates such as the hooker Andrew Hore missed the touring life, and how that made him wonder about the end that was coming. Now that end has come and gone, does he know how Hore felt?</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re never going to see the team run out and not miss that thrill a little bit,\u201d he says. \u201cBut \u2026\u201d Thoughtfully, he taps the table. Since he left, the All Blacks have played four, won four, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/25/new-zealand-wales-match-report\">a 3-0 whitewash of Wales</a> which he watched <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RichieMcCaw07/photos/a.182259302115271.1073741828.180149045659630/290012264673307/?type=3&amp;theater\">from on high</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"848b62d16c3834731be738c5f45cfdce93bbadd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/848b62d16c3834731be738c5f45cfdce93bbadd0/0_27_3238_1944/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richie McCaw Drew Mitchell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">McCaw tackles Australia wing Drew Mitchell during the 2015 World Cup final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou make your decision and move forward. I\u2019ve got a lot of things on. I look back and I\u2019ve got no regrets \u2026 but the thing I wonder about a little bit, with Andrew Hore for example, is that some of his good mates were still there. Whereas probably for me now, you\u2019ve had DC move on and Kevvy [Mealamu] and Conrad [Smith], some of the guys I\u2019ve played a lot of rugby with. If they were still there I\u2019d probably still really miss it.\u201d</p> <p>As Tennyson \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl4ye22U-E\">and Uncle Monty</a> \u2013 had it, the old order changeth, yielding place to new. The All Black team in which McCaw made his debut, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2001/nov/19/rugbyunion.newzealandrugbyunionteam\">against Ireland in Dublin in 2001</a>, included Jonah Lomu. If McCaw\u2019s discussion of his decision to retire seems almost elegiac, the impression is strengthened by the sad realisation that Lomu, the greatest All Black of the era before McCaw, was only 40 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/nov/21/jonah-lomu-death-rugby-union-new-zealand-all-blacks-world-cup\">when he died in November</a>.</p> <p>McCaw continues: \u201cYou know, deep down, any thought I have that \u2018Jeez, I could still be playing\u2019, you\u2019re forgetting all the stuff that goes with getting there. And that\u2019s the bit that you perhaps tire of first. I knew that it was getting harder and harder, especially at club level, to get myself in the right frame of mind.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You\u2019d rather go when they say you could go a little bit longer, than when they say you\u2019ve gone a little bit too long</p> <footer> <cite>On retiring</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou\u2019d rather go just before, when they say you could go a little bit longer, than when they say you\u2019ve gone a little bit too long.\u201d</p> <p>And so McCaw went, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/31/new-zealand-australia-rugby-world-cup-final-match-report\">a 34-17 win over Australia in the World Cup final</a> at Twickenham. After his final final whistle, he was loth to remove the black No7 for the final time. So he kept it on, with his shorts, socks and boots, through the press conference and after. That shirt \u2013 likely to attain holy relic status in New Zealand \u2013 is now at home in Christchurch, \u201cprobably in a bag or a cupboard\u201d.</p> <p>His approach to his legacy is not quite so offhand. There\u2019s a book out, <a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/books/83288645/Reviews-Richie-McCaw-148-Shelter\">Richie McCaw: 148</a>, which gives a coffee-table spread to each of his All Black Tests. Next week a film will follow. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZ0MmhGQ4d8\">Chasing Great</a> is a documentary that covers McCaw\u2019s last year in the team and on the field. In New Zealand it will get a cinematic release, which means a red carpet premiere in Auckland. For someone who professes not to be completely comfortable in the spotlight, a big-screen biopic isn\u2019t an obvious card to play. Is he making a bargain with fame?</p> <p>\u201cA little bit, I suppose. There were a couple of things about the film when it first came up that I thought, \u2018Eh, that doesn\u2019t feel right\u2019. I started to get approached, they wanted a story, and you get no control over that. But the people who have done it\u201d \u2013 co-writers and directors Justin Pemberton and Michelle Walsh \u2013 \u201cI know pretty well.</p> <p>\u201cThey said, \u2018We\u2019d be interested in doing a doco\u2019. And I thought you should do something where you can tell your own story that you want told. I thought maybe a half-hour on TV but they said, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re aiming for cinema\u2019. I thought, \u2018It\u2019s never going to get there\u2019, but bugger me, they ended up with funding.\u201d</p> <p>The result is a mixture of documentary footage, interviews, family videos shot by McCaw\u2019s dad and even a little bit of re-enactment, a child actor playing Young Richie, bowling over coaches at Kurow Rugby Club or rapt in front of a chunky analogue TV as David Kirk\u2019s All Blacks win the 1987 World Cup. That was the last such triumph until older Richie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/oct/23/rugby-world-cup-richie-mccaw-new-zealand-france\">lifted the Webb Ellis Cup in Auckland in 2011</a>, securing his place in history.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2015/nov/19/richie-mccaw-the-all-blacks-captains-stellar-career-in-pictures\">Richie McCaw: the All Blacks captain's stellar career \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He says: \u201cI wanted that if some kids watch it, they be inspired to become an All Black and chase some dreams, because that\u2019s what I did. And the second thing is that you don\u2019t have to come from some privileged background to be an All Black in New Zealand. I\u2019ve been pretty strong on that, that [the film] told a little bit about my upbringing which I haven\u2019t really told a lot. I had some stuff that the old man filmed, to show a little bit about the normal Kiwi bloke.\u201d</p> <p>My time with the greatest normal Kiwi bloke is nearly up. I ask a little more about the spotlight and his life underneath it. He no longer has to deal with a national press obsessed with its national sport, this week happily swimming in a scandal over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/21/all-blacks-explain-delay-in-reporting-bug-in-hotel-after-demolition-of-wallabies\">a bug in the team room</a> in Sydney. But in January he announced his engagement to Gemma Flynn, a member of the New Zealand Black Sticks hockey team, via Facebook. For any All Black, let alone a great one, it might have seemed a little bit out of character, a little bit public, a little bit more Kanye than Kevvy Mealamu. </p> <p>McCaw laughs, and says he never really got social media, and never will get Twitter, but the Facebook announcement just seemed the right way to satisfy public curiosity while maintaining control of his story.</p> <p>A question about the \u201cCurse of McCaw\u201d \u2013 the supposedly chilling effect on New Zealand medal chances of his presence in Rio \u2013 also prompts genial laughter. So does the way the Kiwi media seemed to make more of his meeting Lydia Ko, the young Kiwi who won silver in the golf, than of Ko\u2019s achievement itself. To be fair to the Kiwi media, Ko did say meeting McCaw was more exciting than winning a medal.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a little bit embarrassing, to be fair,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had a wee function at New Zealand House in Rio, she said that and I thought\u2026 \u2018Oh. Bit embarrassing.\u2019 It was nice of her, though, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>It was. As he sets out on life off the field \u2013 which will also include a return to Chicago in November, when the All Blacks will take on Ireland and the M\u0101ori the US Eagles \u2013 plenty of people are prepared to be nice to Richie McCaw. </p>",

Americans as a whole think their country\u2019s best year was 2000, because that was the prelapsarian moment before 9/11.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"09dba60103dfa04fffa780b61b6de219cd8b6bce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09dba60103dfa04fffa780b61b6de219cd8b6bce/0_72_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Last Night of the Proms: a \u2018strange embodiment\u2019 of our relationship to the past.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Last Night of the Proms: a \u2018strange embodiment\u2019 of our relationship to the past.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christie Goodwin/Redferns via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Every country addresses the lure of the past differently. Germany uses the past as a warning. France carries the legacy of 1789 as a national responsibility. Russia remains in thrall to its own frustrated uniqueness. Ireland has managed to put the pain and hatred of the past to one side without denying it, wonderfully in my view.</p> <p>In Britain, lacking a sufficient common culture to transcend differences of class, nation and race, the relationship to the past remains embattled \u2013 despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/28/london-2012-boyle-olympics-opening-ceremony\" title=\"\">Danny Boyle\u2019s Olympic opening ceremony</a> four years ago. The Last Night of the Proms remains a strange embodiment of all that. This year\u2019s post-Brexit Albert Hall flagwaving will add new layers of touchiness.</p> <p>Yet both main political traditions in Britain have a narrative of a past to which they wish to return. The Conservative narrative starts in the defiance of 1940 and speaks of the search to reclaim a lost postwar British greatness. Labour\u2019s story starts in 1945 and speaks of a nation drawn together in war and then peace for a common good which has subsequently been mislaid. Both are still searching, to this day.</p> <p>The Brexit vote in June was not simply about a yearning for the past. It was an expression of anger about the present and hope for the future too. But it cannot be fully understood without grasping the powerful sense among many British voters that the past was better than today. The slogans of regaining control and getting our country back are each rooted in that. It resonates not just with the Tory but with the Labour tradition.</p> <p>The former Conservative minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidwilletts\" title=\"\">David Willetts</a> talks about this syndrome as \u201cbring-backery\u201d. Bring back grammar schools is its most visible manifestation in Tory circles right now, and is certain to get a fresh boost from a perception that this year\u2019s GCSE results show a failing system. But the bring-back agenda goes further. You don\u2019t now hear so much talk as in the 1970s about bringing back flogging, hanging and national service. But conservative cultural values about race, gender, punishment and modernity were the surest correlation with a Brexit vote in June.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6a76f3782c8c0c22c812ca83d865c351db998c81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a76f3782c8c0c22c812ca83d865c351db998c81/0_214_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May outside number 10 Downing Street shortly after becoming prime minister: her desire to bring back grammar schools undercuts her message \u2018not to entrench the advantages of the fortunate few\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May outside number 10 Downing Street shortly after becoming prime minister: her desire to bring back grammar schools undercuts her message \u2018not to entrench the advantages of the fortunate few\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Smart politics recognises this feeling for the past without blinding itself to its limitations. The Times columnist <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/pull-of-the-past-could-be-mrs-mays-downfall-klkk8vkgw\" title=\"\">Rachel Sylvester</a> wrote that the biggest danger to Theresa May is the temptation of making nostalgic gestures to propitiate her party. Grammar schools are one of these gestures. It is dangerous not so much because of academic selection in itself, which has its place, but because \u2013 whether she intends it or not \u2013 the bring-back message undercuts May\u2019s statement outside Number 10 in July that \u201cwhen it comes to opportunity, we won\u2019t entrench the advantages of the fortunate few\u201d. Outside the Tory bubble it signals same-old Tories.</p> <p>Yet while it makes obvious sense for Conservatives to seek solace with the past, this has not been true of Labour until now. Historically, Labour has seen itself as a party of the future. Its manifesto in 1945 was entitled Let Us Face the Future. Newness is a recurrent theme of all postwar Labour propaganda, and not just under New Labour. But Labour is in turmoil because so many supporters think it trashed its own past in favour of a valueless newness.</p> <p>Now, under Jeremy Corbyn, Labour has turned to the past. Corbyn speaks of renationalising the railways, not because it would work well but because he thinks state ownership is right. But it\u2019s as if he wants to hold down that rewind button until we reach the 1970s again, a bit like Life on Mars.</p> <p>One senses he has not had a genuinely new idea in 40 years and is proud of it. And that he won\u2019t be happy until the coal mines are open again and the NUM is on strike against the National Coal Board too.</p> <p>In one of my favourite operas, Wagner\u2019s Die Meistersinger, a medieval guild of singers is outraged when someone with new ideas about music comes to town. The newcomer reciprocates his rejection by shunning the old styles and rules. Only the wisest master, Hans Sachs, fully understands \u2013 and then only with an effort \u2013 that the old and the new both matter alike.</p> <p>Wagner\u2019s lesson is not to spurn the past but to also always do something new. It was always thus. As in art, so in post-Brexit politics.</p>",
  "<p>To find the true centre of power in today\u2019s politics, ignore the sweaty press releases from select committees, look past the upcoming party conferences \u2013 and, for all our&#xa0;sakes, pay no mind to the seat allocations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/the-guardian-view-on-traingate-jeremy-corbyns-search-for-standing\" title=\"\">on the 11am Virgin train to Newcastle</a>.

Since the 2008 crash, what central bankers say and do has moved from the City pages to the front page. That is logical, given that the Bank of England created \u00a3375bn of new money through quantitative easing in the four years after 2009 and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15198789\" title=\"\">has just begun buying \u00a370bn of IOUs</a> from the government and big business. But the power and prominence of central banks today is also deeply worrying. For one, their multibillion-pound interventions have had only limited success \u2013 and it is doubtful that throwing more billions around will work much better. For another, politicians are compelling them to play a central role in our politics, even though they are far less accountable to voters. This is politics in the garb of technocracy.</p> <p>Next month is the eighth anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Since then the US central bank has bought $3.7tn (\u00a32.8tn) of bonds. All the major central banks have cut rates; <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2015/828.aspx\" title=\"\">according to the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist</a>, Andy Haldane, global interest rates are at their lowest in 5,000 years. Despite this, the world economy is, in his description, \u201cstuck\u201d. This government boasts of the UK\u2019s recovery, but workers have seen a 10% drop in real wages since the end of 2007 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/27/uk-joins-greece-at-bottom-of-wage-growth-league-tuc-oecd\" title=\"\">matched among developed economies only by Greece</a>. Fuelling the popularity of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders is the fact that the US is suffering one of the <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/why-is-recovery-taking-so-long-and-who-is-to-blame/\" title=\"\">slowest and weakest recoveries</a> in recent history. In April, the IMF described the state of the global economy as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2016/01/\" title=\"\">Too Slow for Too Long</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Having thrown everything they had at the world economy, all central bankers have to show is the most mediocre of score sheets. When it comes to monetary policy, the old cliche almost fits: you can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it avail itself of super-low interest rates to kickstart a sustainable recovery. Two forces appear to be at work. First, monetary policy has been used by politicians as a replacement for fiscal policy on spending and taxes, when it should really be complementary. Second, major economies \u2013 such as Britain after Thatcher\u2019s revolution \u2013 have become so unequal and lopsided that vast wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few who use it for speculation rather than productive investment. QE has pushed up the&#xa0;price of Mayfair flats and art by&#xa0;Damien Hirst. It has done next to nothing for graphene in Manchester.</p> <p>All this was foreseen by Keynes in his General Theory: \u201cI am now somewhat sceptical of the success of a merely monetary policy directed towards influencing the rate of interest. I expect to see the State, which is in a position to calculate the marginal efficiency of capital-goods on long views and on the basis of the general social advantage, taking an ever greater responsibility for directly organising investment.\u201d</p> <p>Eighty years on, it is time those words were heeded by policymakers. In Britain, that means using state-owned banks such as RBS and Lloyds to direct loans to those industries and parts of the country that elected and accountable politicians see as being in need. Couple that with a tax system that rewards companies on how much value they add to the British economy, and the UK might finally&#xa0;be back in&#xa0;business.</p>",

While CVC holds 35% of the shares, it controls the sport because its shares have special voting rights. Waddell &amp; Reed, an American fund manager, has a stake of just under 20% while Bernie Ecclestone, who is the chief executive of Formula One Group, also has a stake.</p> <p>Formula One Group holds the commercial rights to the sport, making its money from sponsorship deals, television rights, and charging fees to the venues that host the races.</p> <p>Despite CVC making billions from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone\">Formula One</a>, the sport is under pressure to become more entertaining due to the dominance of Mercedes, whose drivers are<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton\"> Lewis Hamilton</a> and Nico Rosberg. </p> <p>The motor-racing tracks in Europe, including Silverstone in the UK, are struggling to make a profit from hosting grand prix events once the fee to Formula One Group is taken into account.

I enjoy taking a tour of a very wealthy estate.\u201d It helps explain his homing instinct to Cannes; cue an Allenish anecdote about going on a surprisingly rocky yacht.</p> <p>No, he wouldn\u2019t want to be richer, he says, though it emerges he does spend $100 a week on lottery tickets. But winning wouldn\u2019t change much: \u201cI\u2019ve talked this over with my wife. We would still go on living in the same house, I would go on working, I don\u2019t want a boat, I don\u2019t want a plane.\u201d</p> <p>So why do it? He seems stumped. \u201cThe odds are bigger than astronomical. You\u2019d have a better chance of shuffling a deck of cards and naming them all in row. I\u2019ve never got more than two numbers. I\u2019d probably shoot myself if I got five and missed by one. That would really be a killer \u2013 but I don\u2019t have that problem.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e25a6e5d92d90be2727e359485790bd841c78bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e25a6e5d92d90be2727e359485790bd841c78bf/0_202_4896_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Allen on the set of Caf\u00e9 Society with Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Allen on the set of Caf\u00e9 Society with Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Sands/GC Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Don\u2019t be fooled by Caf\u00e9 Society\u2019s tourist-bait take on Tinseltown. Don\u2019t get blinded by its goggle-eyes at the glimpse of bling. It may look lush, but a good 60% of that rose-tint is jaundice. The movie biz, says someone, is \u201cboring, nasty, dog-eat-dog\u201d. Hollywood, remarks Allen\u2019s narrator, is \u201ca town run on ego\u201d \u2013 plain and simple, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/11/cafe-society-and-life-animated-reviews\">no leavening punchline</a>.</p> <p>But then, he says today, cheerfully spooling out the doominess, where isn\u2019t? \u201cI\u2019m sure every business is full of phonies and people that don\u2019t return phone calls and play the big shot. I\u2019m sure it exists on Wall Street and in London and Rome, but Hollywood always gets the rap because there it\u2019s so obvious. You\u2019re dealing with one diva after another.\u201d</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t think other towns are more fuelled by, say, sex or money or art? He twiddles his hearing aid to check he\u2019s heard right. \u201cSex <em>is</em> the ultimate end. The ambition is <em>so</em> that they can fulfil their sexual drives; that\u2019s what everybody is going for. This is what animals are. People are in a kind of meaningless jumble to recreate, and nobody knows why. The same woman who says, \u2018People are terrible, life is awful, it\u2019s sad, it\u2019s short, nasty and meaningless\u2019 still wants to have a couple of children. It defies any intellect. It\u2019s strictly emotional.\u201d</p> <p>Like all Allen\u2019s work, Cafe Society is consumed by how we cope with mortality. Its director <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1066-i-don-t-want-to-achieve-immortality-through-my-work-i\">famously said</a> he\u2019d like to achieve immortality through not dying, rather than his movies; his film has a Jewish gangster becoming Catholic on death row in search of consolation (just as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4use18Z9Lc\">Woody failed to in Hannah and her Sisters</a>). Isn\u2019t this the world\u2019s most urgent issue, I ask. If people could only accept death was the end, the likes of Isis would have more of a recruitment problem.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNLUUfFLlQ0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bNLUUfFLlQ0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Crisis in Six Scenes</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t speak for all suicide bombers,\u201d he says mildly, fishing out the remote control for his hearing aid again, which forever makes you think he is trying to unlock a car. \u201cBut without a firm faith in an afterlife, many of them would not do those things. They do believe when they blow themselves up that there\u2019s going to be positive payoff. That it isn\u2019t simply going to be what it is, though some of them might be willing to do it anyhow, to consider it a noble sacrifice for a noble cause. They\u2019re misguided, in my opinion.\u201d He smiles. \u201cBut they don\u2019t agree with me.\u201d</p> <p>What would he die for? Only his family, he thinks. Had he been 15 years older, he wouldn\u2019t have felt compelled to actively serve in the war. \u201cI can\u2019t see myself in a ditch somewhere in the rain at night fighting in a jungle off the coast of Japan. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d hold up very well. I get annoyed when the air conditioning doesn\u2019t work.\u201d</p> <p>Has he noticed any recent rise in antisemitism? Well, not personally, he says, sitting up a bit. But friends have. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me. It\u2019s in the nature of people to have someone to scapegoat. If there were no Jews in the world they would take it out on blacks. If no blacks, they\u2019d move over to Catholics. No Catholics? Something else. Finally, if everyone is exactly the same, the left-handed people would start killing the right-handed people. You just need an other [on whom] to vent your hostility and frustration.\u201d</p> <p>He shrugs. \u201cHopefully, the wave will ebb and people will realise that\u2019s not the problem and focus more on what the problems are. But the world is full of intolerance and prejudice. Freud said there would always be antisemitism because people are a sorry lot. And they <em>are</em> a sorry lot.\u201d He twinkles through the specs, left eye a little awry these days, like a Woody Allen action doll that\u2019s been dropped. He\u2019s tiny. Some stars are shorter than you expect; he seems, literally, still inside the TV.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"223bda0638e0a204cf6c0c4c0335eb65073e53b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/223bda0638e0a204cf6c0c4c0335eb65073e53b0/0_110_2022_2021/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Allen and Mia Farrow in 1989\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Allen and Mia Farrow in 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Galella/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Allen has long been resigned to life\u2019s deep bleakness. He is the wise-cracking nihilist, jokes provoked by the need not to leap. Yet some cynicism seems to be distilling. While previous films left characters wrestling guilt, this last one metes out justice with a wallop. When he talks about the world being \u201cfull of terrified people walking round suffering tremendously\u201d, it carries more charge than the old patter.</p> <p>I suggest he\u2019s getting tougher as he gets older. He chuckles and says the opposite is true. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the Nietzschean notion that what doesn\u2019t destroy you makes you stronger. You see these soldiers come back with PTSD; they\u2019ve been to war and seen death and experienced these existential crises one after the other. There are traumas in life that weaken us for the future. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happened to me. The various slings and arrows of life have not strengthened me. I think I\u2019m weaker. I think there are things I couldn\u2019t take now that I would have been able to take when I was younger.\u201d</p> <p>It was in 1992 that everything changed. Allen left Mia Farrow for her adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn, then 21 \u2013 Farrow found out after <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/1992/11/farrow199211\">discovering intimate photos</a>. Then followed a custody battle for their three children, Moses, Dylan and Ronan, then the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/13/woody-allen-juicy-scandal\">claim of molestation</a> of Dylan, aged seven. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/04/nyregion/doctor-cites-inconsistencies-in-dylan-farrow-s-statements.html\">Credible evidence</a> wasn\u2019t found and the charge was not pursued. Yet the media trial continues. At Cannes came the grenade of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/11/ronan-farrow-condemns-media-woody-allen-allegations\">Ronan\u2019s Hollywood Reporter piece</a>, attacking the festival for its celebration, stars for collaboration and the press for perceived cowardice. The next day, reporters raised it. Allen\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/12/woody-allen-ronan-farrow-cannes-cafe-society-film\">response remained the same</a>: he hadn\u2019t read the piece, the law had been plain, and he had <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/opinion/sunday/woody-allen-speaks-out.html?_r=0\">said all he was going to</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I get harassed all the time. But it doesn't affect me and I just have no interest in it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Last week, he reiterates his position. \u201cI have no interest in all of that. I find that all tabloid stupidity. That situation had been thoroughly, thoroughly investigated up and down the line by New York social services in a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/26/nyregion/agency-drops-abuse-inquiry-in-allen-case.html\">14-month investigation</a>. It had been investigated by Yale and conclusions were clear and I have no interest in that whole situation. I get harassed all the time on it. But it doesn\u2019t affect me and I just have no interest in it.\u201d</p> <p>He sounds weary, sad, flat. He\u2019s not used the word \u201charassed\u201d in relation to the case before; today he uses it twice, the second time directing me to <a href=\"https://ronanfarrowletter.wordpress.com/2016/05/30/hard-questions-for-ronan-farrow-an-open-letter/\">an article rebutting Ronan</a> (\u201cprobably the best thing written on this since the whole harassment started \u2026 mature and not vitriolic and decent\u201d). Which suggests that he may read some press, and that he is affected by it.</p> <p>The opposite would be impossible. Even dismissed allegations can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/woody-allen-polanski-cosby-dangerous-cannes-ronan-farrow\">smear a career</a>. And while he and <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/dylan-farrows-brother-moses-mia-farrow-woody-allen/story?id=22377303\">Moses are now reconciled</a>, Allen is estranged from Dylan and Ronan, despite a judge <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/27/the-woody-allen-allegations-not-so-fast.html\">rejecting the application</a> that his adoptive parenthood of the former two be revoked (meanwhile <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/02/woody-allen-son-ronan-frank-sinatra-mia-farrow\">Mia has hinted</a> Ronan is actually Frank Sinatra\u2019s son). Has the whole thing altered his view of the world? \u201cNo, no,\u201d he chuckles. \u201cIt confirmed all my misanthropic feelings.\u201d</p> <p>Allen\u2019s strategy, then, is to throw up his hands and stop his ears. He may have an iPhone, but it\u2019s strictly for calls, jazz and the weather app. And this determined detachment would help explain why, as the web rakes over the details, 24 years on, Allen remains remarkably frank, even blithe, discussing his private life.</p> <p>Of his wife and the daughters (Bechet, 17 and Manzie, 16) they adopted soon after their wedding in 1997, he speaks often, fondly \u2013 and oddly off-message. Of parenting, he tells me: \u201cYou can count on them until adolescence. You\u2019re king in the house and you\u2019re much needed and much loved and depended on. Once they start to come into their adulthood they start to feel their oats, then, all of a sudden, it\u2019s a different story.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d93f0d942c8cc654335f4e584849ebf5b0cc0aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d93f0d942c8cc654335f4e584849ebf5b0cc0aa/0_204_2292_1375/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With his wife Soon-Yi in Cannes in 2015\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With his wife Soon-Yi in Cannes in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Relationships, he says, again unguarded, \u201care not my strong point in life. I\u2019ve always been dependent on the generosity of the woman; nothing I could do ever seduced them.\u201d That was the case with Diane Keaton, with whom he is still close: \u201cShe had come to the conclusion she liked me. It was always the other person who decided.\u201d</p> <p>He happily chats about how nice meals often end in spousal rows, but says that it is because of Soon-Yi that the man once defined by his psychoanalysis hasn\u2019t seen a shrink in years. \u201cI don\u2019t have to any more. I\u2019m functioning OK. I\u2019m in a happy marriage. I haven\u2019t needed that support.\u201d</p> <p>Do others come to him for advice? He reels at the idea. \u201cI don\u2019t have that many friends. I lead a very isolated life. I come home and I\u2019m with my family. I go to dinner with a few friends and, every once in a while, they\u2019ll ask for advice, but it\u2019s never existential.\u201d</p> <p>And, after dinner, he heads home, turns on the TV for 20 minutes \u201cand I\u2019m asleep\u201d. Never a comedy \u2013 he has never seen anything in the same genre as his Amazon show \u2013 and if not news, baseball, which \u201calways interests me much more than any kind of show\u201d. But the New York teams <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/standings/\">have struck out this season</a>, so he has resorted to the Olympics, with moderate rewards.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t find it that thrilling to watch people swim up and back across a pool. I need a more complex sport \u2013 something that has got a different narrative to it than just a sudden burst of speed or a quick jump. And I watch any sports.

I\u2019m in good health \u2013 at least I think I am. Dementia hasn\u2019t set in yet to any noticeable degree. Everything is fine, but I\u2019m always consumed with sorrow that I can\u2019t get out on a baseball field and play it the way I could. That, for me, is the most poignant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to race against Usain Bolt,\u201d he adds wistfully. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure how well I\u2019d do. I was always a very fast runner. But it\u2019s possible that while I\u2019m still running, he would be doing his post-race interview.\u201d</p> <p>Late-stage Woody Allen, then, is a man who gets through by playing ball, even if the sport is stacked against him. By disregarding the results and declining to dwell. \u201cYou\u2019re probably happier in life if you can forget things,\u201d he advises.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/26/woody-allen-blue-jasmine-tantrums\">Woody Allen on Blue Jasmine: 'You see tantrums in adults all the time'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And yet, there may be a coda.

  "<p>Like Londoners \u2013 and, I assume, Parisians, Berliners, Muscovites and long-time residents of Beijing \u2013 New Yorkers pride themselves on being instantly recognisable to each other as locals, in contrast to the ranks of aimless tourists who clog up the city. It is a moment to be relished when, walking around Times Square, the tour bus touts take one look at your scowling face and head-to-toe black wardrobe and drop their pitch, or, emerging from the subway, you know instinctively and without looking for landmarks, which way is uptown.</p> <p>There is, however, one test that even the most professional New Yorker can\u2019t always pass, a challenge akin to negotiating the most intricate parts of London\u2019s one-way system, and that is the dead spot in the middle of Central Park.</p> <p>Last week I lost a friend who has lived in the city her entire life \u2013 40-odd years \u2013 to the Central Park Triangle for almost an hour, a twilight zone into which she fell while trying to walk across the park, east to west, to meet me for lunch. For those who haven\u2019t attempted this, I should point out this is not like taking a stroll through Hyde Park. The paths twist and turn, there are myriad forks in the road and infuriating spaghetti junction-type interchanges. Twenty minutes late, she texted me in a panic to say she was in an overgrown part of the park she\u2019d never seen in her life, which was not only deserted, like something from scary 1970s New York, but gave her no view of the perimeter skyline to indicate which way was out.</p> <p>After walking for 30 minutes she was right back where she started. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.blairwitch.com/\">Blair Witch Project</a>\u201d, I texted and settled in to see what happened next, which was this: she kept me on speaker so she wasn\u2019t alone, and after asking several people which way was west \u2013 each time with the caveat \u201cI\u2019m a New Yorker, but \u2026\u201d \u2013 a group of Italian tourists came to her aid by using the compass apps on their phones.

  "<p>Like Coco Chanel, Sonia Rykiel, who has died aged 86, went into fashion to provide herself with garments she could not otherwise obtain. She had no design training and not much ambition, but in 1961 she charmed the suppliers to her husband\u2019s family-owned boutique in Paris into making maternity dresses for her that, radically, revealed her bump, and thus scandalised her mother-in-law. Later, she asked a representative from an Italian machine-knitwear company to make a sweater modified from one Rykiel was wearing \u2013 she wanted it smaller, with a high armhole and tight sleeves.</p> <p>The prototype went back and forth between Paris and Venice seven times before the perfect \u201cpoor-boy sweater\u201d, skinny-ribbed and striped, arrived in the shop. A staffer from Elle happened to be present: Fran\u00e7oise Hardy modelled it for the magazine\u2019s cover, Brigitte Bardot and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/5894883/Audrey-Hepburn.html\" title=\"\">Audrey Hepburn</a> bought several, and other knitwear companies struggled and failed to reproduce Rykiel\u2019s novel approach. As Chanel had elevated jersey from a utilitarian textile for underwear to a fashion fabric, so Rykiel (along with the Italian Missoni family) extended its use into the basis for her oeuvre over more than 40 years: clothes for adult women, with her attitude built into their construction. Women\u2019s Wear Daily called her \u201cQueen of the Knits\u201d, but she confessed she didn\u2019t know the pointy end of a knitting needle from the blunt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de23884c6d6240e7db6c0fe3b45ba5fbe0a42767\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de23884c6d6240e7db6c0fe3b45ba5fbe0a42767/0_74_2896_1738/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sonia Rykiel, right, at her workshop in 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MUUS/Sipa/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She had not had to learn. Her father was Alfred Flis, a watchmaker from Romania; her mother, Fanny (nee Tesler), was Russian, a lady of leisure; and Sonia was the eldest, reddest-haired and most dramatic of five chic sisters. As an artistic Jewish family, they kept a low profile in the Neuilly-sur-Seine suburb of Paris and houses in the country during the second world war, discreet if not quite in hiding. Afterwards, Sonia\u2019s only job was a stint window-dressing in her teens: Henri Matisse bought most of her display of scarves. Her marriage to Sam Rykiel, in 1953, led to the life of shopping, not running a shop, for which she had been raised.</p> <p>In the years after the poor-boy sweat- er, she designed a couple of dresses and a raincoat, also for Sam\u2019s boutique, Laura, which attracted many American customers. Named-designer pr\u00e9t-\u00e0-porter was emerging in Paris as an alternative to couture \u2013 younger, faster, cheaper, sexier, yet more intellectual \u2013 and in 1968, as the Rykiel marriage foundered, she decided to start her own boutique, in the zone of the moment, the Left Bank. The shop in Rue de Grenelle opened in May 1968, the day before Sorbonne students threw their first cobblestones. She closed, and re-opened later when things calmed down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7acd47daff1ce81e450c6cdd5413ebf30bd0f49e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7acd47daff1ce81e450c6cdd5413ebf30bd0f49e/46_26_1834_1099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sonia Rykiel look of 1977.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Sonia Rykiel look of 1977.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arthur Elgort/Conde Nast/Contour by Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rykiel knew all the practitioners of pr\u00e9t-\u00e0-porter, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jun/02/fashion.france2\" title=\"\">Yves Saint Laurent</a>, whose business manager <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/57f09052-f692-11e5-803c-d27c7117d132.html\" title=\"\">Pierre Berg\u00e9</a> invited her to join Les Cr\u00e9ateurs, a group for these arrivistes: she did not send models to their show, but premiered her collections in her boutique, which later moved to, and stayed on, Boulevard Saint-Germain.</p> <p>Even in the 1970s, when Rykiel followed Les Cr\u00e9ateurs\u2019 example and began to show on catwalks, she retained her women-enjoying-themselves-together atmosphere among the models rather than adopting the chilly, solitary strut of the new couture. Her models might have been family: striking Parisiennes (if only by adoption), Parisiennes, women with a job, artistic appreciation, a complicated life and no shortage of lovers. Rykiel recalled having, simultaneously, two lovers in Paris, one in Italy, and one in New York, buying each their favourite brand of cigarettes at the airport on the way to rendezvous, until she presented one with a carton of the wrong brand, and <em>pouf</em>, the whole edifice fell down.</p> <p>Her clothes were her \u2013 sensual as much as sexual (strokable velour T-shirts), witty, and explicit about their manufacture: she shifted seams to the outside and left hems raw years before the Japanese. They were wearable by a wide range of non-stick-model figures \u2013 she was delighted that the US first lady Michelle Obama appreciated them. All that was part of what she called <em>la d\u00e9mod\u00e9</em> \u2013 non-fashion. There was only incremental change from season to season, slight variants of the forms she established at the start: there was always a striped sweater, always a sloganed one.

She was not reticent about her celebrity, and grew to like the portraits that Andy Warhol made of her after hours of Polaroid-snapping in his Factory.

Her comments at Jackson Hole in the US on Friday afternoon will be scrutinised for hints about when the central bank could raise interest rates, with various analysts expecting her to be hawkish, dovish or neutral. With that uncertainty it is no surprise that investors have been erring on the side of caution. And after recent falls in the oil price, along with a drop in pharmaceutical shares following comments on excessive pricing by US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, stock markets ended the day in negative territory.

After appearances from Dudley and Fischer last week, today\u2019s input from voting member George adds yet another voice to the increasingly deafening push for a rate hike in the coming months. With the election looking unpredictable, the likeliness is that members will see December as the month to press the button once more, one year on from the contentious 2015 rise. It is hard to see Janet Yellen delivering anything other than a relatively hawkish outlook tomorrow [at Jackson Hole] and with the dollar having suffered heavily in recent weeks, tomorrow could be a turning point for foreign exchange markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bf0813e4b0568600c043aa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-25T15:08:16.331Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another comment suggesting that the Jackson Hole gathering of central bankers in the US could be a damp squib, despite expectations that Fed chair Janet Yellen could hint at future rate rises. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Investors continue to hold back from taking on additional market exposure ahead of tomorrow\u2019s speech from Janet Yellen at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. Few expect the Fed Chairman to say anything explicit about the likelihood or timing of what would be the US central bank\u2019s first rate hike since December last year. Nevertheless, there are hopes that she may give some clues as to the Fed\u2019s thinking over the state of the US economy, and indeed any risks facing the global economy as well.</p> <p>Last week we heard hawkish rhetoric from three Fed members. Then on Sunday Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer provided an upbeat outlook for the US economy saying that he expected growth to pick up following a particularly weak second quarter. Not only that, but he said that the Fed\u2019s targets for inflation and unemployment (the dual mandate) were close to being hit. If Yellen is similarly upbeat in her speech tomorrow, then investors will price in an increased possibility of a September hike.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a50a3b0195a5e2b38fe60a4075ed6a990ed708ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a50a3b0195a5e2b38fe60a4075ed6a990ed708ae/0_329_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Uncertainty over Federal Reserve rate outlook\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uncertainty over Federal Reserve rate outlook</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>But despite all this chatter and speculation, it seems unlikely that Yellen will want to paint herself into a corner over the future direction of US monetary policy.</p> <p>Consequently, it could be that there\u2019s little of substance in the speech. While we\u2019ve had a clutch of Fed-heads out there trying to persuade investors that September is still \u201clive\u201d when it comes to a rate hike, the minutes from the last meeting in July showed that only one out of ten FOMC-voting members was in favour of tightening monetary policy. In addition, we\u2019ll get a stack of fresh economic data ahead of the Fed\u2019s next meeting, including Non-Farm Payrolls, Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMIs and inflation numbers. There\u2019s really no point in committing to any course of action until the Fed sees these reports.</p> <p>Finally, I don\u2019t believe that the FOMC has the faintest idea what they should do at the next meeting. And unfortunately we now have a central bank which pays too much attention to stock market movements and appears to relish its ability to influence short-term investor behaviour.</p> <p>Overall, I think there\u2019s just too much importance being attached to this speech.

  "<p>Two major fund management firms have backed an influential shareholder group in publicly criticising corporate governance at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/sports-direct-international\">Sports Direct</a> and demanding change at the top of the retail group.</p> <p>Legal &amp; General Investment Management said it would be voting against the re-election of all Sports Direct\u2019s non-executive directors, including the chairman, Keith Hellawell, whom it has voted against for the past two years.</p> <p>Aberdeen Asset Management said it would also be voting against the reappointment of Hellawell, as well as chief executive Dave Forsey and acting chief financial officer Matt Pearson.</p> <p>Both shareholder groups said they would be supporting a trade-union-backed resolution that calls for an independent review of labour practices at the retail group, in the wake of a highly critical parliamentary report and an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">investigation by the Guardian</a>.</p> <p>L&amp;G\u2019s move comes after the Investor Forum, a shareholder group with combined assets of \u00a314.5tn, ratcheted up pressure on Sports Direct by publicly criticising the retailer\u2019s corporate governance failings.</p> <p>It is the first time that the Investor Forum, set up two years ago, has aired concerns about a company in public. The group has 40 members and represents 27% of Sports Direct\u2019s independent shareholders, including L&amp;G, Aviva, Standard Life and Fidelity.</p> <p>\u201cGovernance failings are clearly resulting in declines in operating performance and long-term shareholder value,\u201d <a href=\"http://media.wix.com/ugd/1cf1e4_92f4632de08048fd8f551d92adc5158b.pdf\">said the Investor Forum</a>, deploring the lack of progress.

We are disappointed that there have been no new non-executive board appointments in the last five years.\u201d</p> <p>Aberdeen Asset Management, which owns less than 0.5% of the retailer\u2019s stock, said in a statement:<strong> </strong>\u201cLike many investors, we have been in dialogue with Sports Direct for some time. Its [AGM] is the latest formal interaction, and offers an opportunity again to press for constructive change. </p> <p>\u201cThe company\u2019s well-chronicled problems and [Mike Ashley\u2019s] comments to the select committee have highlighted the need to upgrade the senior management team. Sports Direct is a multimillion-pound business that would benefit from an injection of new talent with the skill sets required to run an enterprise of its size and complexity.\u201d</p> <p>For the first time this year, independent shareholders will hold real sway at Sports Direct\u2019s AGM, under new regulatory rules governing companies that have a controlling shareholder with a stake of 30% or more. In the past, founder and executive deputy chairman Mike Ashley, who owns a 55% stake, was able to outvote any detractors. But now the election of non-executive directors must be approved separately by minority shareholders. To go against their wishes, Sports Direct would be forced to hold another vote between three and six months later. While he could out-vote minority shareholders at that point, such a move would be highly contentious.</p> <p>In an effort to win over its critics, Sports Direct announced earlier this week that it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/24/sports-direct-allows-public-to-attend-annual-general-meeting\">open its doors to the public</a> on the day of the AGM, held in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. </p> <p>Andy Griffiths, the executive director of the Investor Forum, welcomed the plan for an open day but said the group had not received an \u201cappropriate level of commitment to respond to investor concerns and, as a result, the usual options have been exhausted.\u201d \u201cWe do not take this step lightly,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In July, it was announced that thousands of warehouse workers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/15/sports-direct-staff-to-receive-back-pay-unite-hmrc\">would receive back pay</a> totalling about \u00a31m after the retailer admitted breaking the law by not paying the national minimum wage. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">Guardian investigation last year</a> exposed the fact that Sports Direct workers were being paid less than the legal requirement. The company and its employment agencies face fines of up to \u00a32m.</p> <p>The Investor Forum called on the retailer to carry out a \u201cwide-reaching independent review of the entire governance practices at the company\u201d, as recommended by a parliamentary select committee, not just its employment practices. It also called on Sports Direct to review corporate governance and board oversight and effectiveness, acquisition strategy and associated due diligence, and the oversight of key supplier relationships and the management of its store portfolio.</p> <p>The group said it did not regard the review of employment practices being carried out by RPC, Sports Direct\u2019s lawyers, as independent, echoing the views of other shareholders. The recently announced external board evaluation \u201cfails to reflect the breadth and magnitude of reform that is required\u201d, it said.</p> <p>On Monday, it emerged that Sports Direct pays a company owned by the brother of Mike Ashley to deliver online purchases <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/22/sports-direct-pays-mike-ashleys-older-brother-international-delivery\">to customers outside the UK</a>.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s largest union, Unite, called on Sports Direct to tackle \u201cendemic abuses\u201d within its employment agencies and move longstanding agency workers on to direct, permanent contracts. Unite, which has been leading a campaign against \u201cVictorian\u201d work practices at Sports Direct, is urging shareholders to back the AGM resolution for an independent review into work practices.</p> <p>The Unite assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, said: <em>\u201c</em>Sports Direct has achieved a rare feat in uniting the City, politicians and Unite in the need to address deep-seated problems with its work practices and corporate governance.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Drivers for Uber\u2019s food delivery service are planning a protest in the latest sign of discontent within the gig economy.</p> <p>UberEats riders will demonstrate outside the group\u2019s London headquarters on Friday after the company cut the amount it pays per delivery, which some drivers say leaves them at risk of earning less than the minimum wage. They are calling on the company to pay the independently backed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.livingwage.org.uk/calculation\">London living wage</a> of \u00a39.40 an hour.</p> <p>The action comes after more than 100 moped riders and cyclists <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/11/deliveroo-couriers-demonstrate-against-new-contract\">took to the streets</a> to protest against pay changes at rival food courier service Deliveroo, eventually <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/16/deliveroo-announces-it-will-not-force-new-contracts-on-workers\">seeing off an attempt</a> to force them to accept new pay terms.</p> <p>UberEats drivers, who earned as much as \u00a320 an hour during peak meal times when the service launched in June, told the Guardian they are now earning less than \u00a310, even at peak times. Off peak, drivers earn \u00a33.30 per delivery, plus a mileage payment between the restaurant where food is picked up and the drop location, minus a 25% fee taken by UberEats. </p> <p>The changeable rates mean that some are at risk of earning less than the minimum wage over the course of a week, according to pay records passed to the Guardian.</p> <p>All drivers are self-employed, which means that they do not receive holiday or sick pay, or any hourly wage while they wait around for orders.</p> <p>Imran Siddiqui, a scooter courier at UberEats, said: \u201cAlthough they speak of \u2018flexibility\u2019 the bosses at UberEats have been cutting pay since day one. We\u2019re telling them we need the London living wage. I\u2019d like to ask them: where is the freedom in poverty wages? \u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get by, but it\u2019s been a race to the bottom.\u201d</p> <p>Mags Dewhurst, the chair of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain couriers and logistics branch, which has been working with the delivery drivers, said: \u201cUber is becoming less and less rewarding to work for. It is reducing its rates during peak times as a response to piece rates.</p> <p>\u201cBy paying a piece rate, they are saying they only want to pay for work when they can make a profit out of it. They are saying work is only when someone is making a delivery, but people are providing a service to the company when they are standing around waiting for orders. Without that, UberEats wouldn\u2019t be able to function.\u201d</p> <p>On average, couriers take home more than the London living wage at meal times, UberEats said.</p> <p>Alex Czarnecki, the general manager of UberEats in London, said: \u201cWe\u2019re committed to being the best option for couriers in London. Unlike other companies, we don\u2019t set shifts, minimum hours or delivery zones. Couriers can simply log in or out when and where they choose.</p> <p>\u201cThis is why we\u2019ve seen hundreds of new couriers sign up in the last week alone. As UberEats grows, couriers are busier than ever. In fact, so far this week, couriers delivering lunch and dinner have made over 10% more an hour than they did in the same period last week. Our office is open and our team is always available to chat to couriers.\u201d<br></p> <p>At peak times, drivers now earn \u00a33.30 per delivery, plus a \u00a34 \u201cpromotion\u201d amount per job between 11.30am and 2.30pm, or a \u00a33 promotion between 6.30pm and 9.30pm, as well as the mileage payment. UberEats then takes a 25% cut.</p> <p>Drivers are upset as UberEats has been gradually cutting the promotion part of the fee as it takes on more people and becomes busier. UberEats said a driver would earn about \u00a37.60 for a peak time delivery if they travelled 1.5 miles.</p> <p>UberEats began recruiting delivery drivers this summer in an attempt to take on Deliveroo and grab a slice of the UK\u2019s takeaway food market.</p> <p>The San Francisco-based company, which began as a taxi-hailing app, initially offered a \u00a3100 signing-on fee to delivery partners, its term for bicycle and scooter drivers, to tempt them away from rivals.</p> <p>An ad campaign called <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/uber-tells-story-drivers-riders-first-major-uk-ad-campaign/1397411#\">get there with Uber</a> sought to woo customers and drivers by suggesting that income from working for the company could help them start their own business.</p> <p>Uber\u2019s phenomenal growth has been <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/26/uber-expansion-meets-global-revolt-and-crackdown\">met with opposition</a> from traditional taxi services, leading to major protests and bans in some European cities.</p> <p>The company is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/19/uber-drivers-court-tribunal-self-employed-uk-employment-law\">facing a legal challenge</a> from its drivers, who say they should be recognised officially as Uber workers, rather than counted as self-employed.</p>",

How the primary diet of the lynx is the snowshoe hare, and without it, the population dies.</p> <p> \u201cThere probably aren\u2019t more than 300 wolverines left in the Rockies,\u201d he lamented.</p> <p> The next night we camped just outside the Yellowstone boundary on a bluff that burned during the 1988 fires. Already, tall, brilliant saplings were taking over the blackened totem poles of their ancestors.</p> <p> We made a little fire, just enough to warm our knees and hands, but not enough to alter the starlight pouring down through the trees. We were tired, that good tired, and didn\u2019t speak much. By now, the madness of everyday life was as far off as the Milky Way.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/24/yellowstone-national-park-visitors-wildlife-safety\">Increase in Yellowstone visitors raises park's concerns over wildlife and safety</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p> The next day, we arrived at Thorofare Ranger station, the most remote cabin in all national parks outside Alaska.</p> <p> A park ranger came out and shook our hands and said \u201cmore than three million people visit Yellowstone every year, but probably not more than a hundred get this far back!\u201d</p> <p> He wanted to know if we\u2019d seen any bears. </p> <p> \u201cJust scat,\u201d Dave said with disappointment.</p> <p> \u201cWell then you must be doing everything right.\u201d</p> <p> At dusk we forded the freezing Thorofare Creek, bare assed and barefoot, and set up our tent amid enormous wolf tracks in the snow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3aa3b1f35e15f49e4d685316d4a9455474040fff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3aa3b1f35e15f49e4d685316d4a9455474040fff/0_47_3266_1961/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pack of gray timber wolves at snowy Yellowstone.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pack of gray timber wolves at snowy Yellowstone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Parsons/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> \u201cWolves once roamed the entire continent, from Panama to Prudhoe Bay,\u201d Dave told me that night. But due to government bounties and predator control policies designed to help ranchers, the last original Yellowstone wolf was killed in 1926. Then, over vociferous objections of ranchers, wolves were reintroduced into Yellowstone National Park in 1995.</p> <p> \u201cToday there are an estimated 1700 wolves in the Northern Rockies,\u201d Dave said. \u201cThey are a keystone species.\u201d</p> <p> A keystone species is one that directly impacts the balance of the ecosystem. In Yellowstone, the extermination of wolves caused the elk population to explode. With no wolves to disperse them, elk chewed down the aspen saplings and willows along streams, which depleted the food source for the beavers, reducing their numbers. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Today, what visitors to Yellowstone most want to see \u2013 more than elk or buffalo or even geysers \u2013 is a wolf</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Fewer beavers caused a drop in beaver dams, which reduced the amount of cool, shaded water, which reduced the fish populations. Fewer willows caused a drop in migrating neotropical songbirds.</p> <p> \u201cEverything is connected,\u201d said Dave, poking the fire with a stick.</p> <p> Today, what visitors to Yellowstone most want to see \u2013 more than elk or buffalo or even geysers \u2013 is a wolf.</p> <p> That night, after days of hard hiking, I slept like a dead man. I awoke to a deep-throated howl. The roar was so close and so loud I thought Gaillard was having me on. I crawled from my tent to find him pumping the camp stove, his furred red face grinning ear to ear.</p> <p> \u201cQuite a wake-up call isn\u2019t it!\u201d he said. \u201cNot 50 yards away. Biggest wolf I\u2019ve seen in my life.\u201d</p> <p> Envious, I scanned the valley. It was twilight, the stars still vanishing into a lavender sky, straight dead pines white with frost.</p> <p> I didn\u2019t see a wolf. I saw wild, open, primeval country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf73e11ca2ae44073f634f356fb2bba5d53875b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf73e11ca2ae44073f634f356fb2bba5d53875b4/0_30_1919_1151/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wolves\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p> After that first howl, we assumed a portent silence. Wolves have an acute sense of hearing. I knew they were watching us right now, through the gloaming, but we couldn\u2019t see them. Like dogs and cats, wolves have a thin, reflective film inside their retinas, called the tapetum lucidum, which gives them night vision.</p> <p> Dave headed off to break a hole in the ice and fill our pot while I lowered the food bag out of the tree. A short time later we were standing over the dead coals of last night\u2019s fire, stomping our frozen boots, digging into our bowls of hot granola and watching the sunlight gild the surrounding summits.</p> <p> Then the gorgeous howl came back. This time it was much farther away and echoed across the still-shaded valley. Another howl answered it from the stony mountainside to the northwest, then another from the dark line of forest to the southeast.</p> <p> The wolves had triangulated us.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Black as night, the wolves looked right at me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> \u201cThis is the Delta pack,\u201d said Dave, \u201ccould be as many as a dozen.\u201d</p> <p> We were standing in the most remote place in the lower 48, two small, pink creatures inside a prodigious sanctuary. The wolves commenced to sing. Perhaps three or four in a group, a call and refrain. Dave threw his arms back like a preacher.</p> <p> \u201cNow this is Yellowstone!\u201d</p> <p> They howled together in thundering choruses, bringing music to the morning. Individual voices could be distinguished, just like in a choir. Numerous basses, two baritones, even a tenor trying out her young pipes. They ululated for perhaps five minutes, then abruptly stopped.</p> <p> I began glassing along a bank of trees to the south from whence the closest howling had come, stopping for some reason on a stand of spruce. I was studying the conifers when two huge wolves stepped out into the open. Black as night, they looked right at me, then loped off through the trees.</p> <p> I had so desperately wanted to get away, to escape \u2013 and I\u2019d done it. But now everything was inverted. Being there in the moment in the mountains with the wolves, I realized we actually hadn\u2019t gotten away from it all, we gotten right into the middle of it. The office and the asphalt are what felt strange now. We had hiked ourselves back in time into an environment that was once common and now barely exists, a place I had imagined to be silent and austere but was in truth songful and profoundly complex. </p> <p> And is this not the very point of a national park? To reveal a world in which humans are just another species in a beautifully intricate ecosystem. </p>",
  "<p>The great events of the mid-1660s are familiar to every British schoolchild: the fire in London that flattened most of the medieval City, the great plague that killed around a quarter of the capital\u2019s inhabitants and the second Anglo-Dutch war. Meanwhile in a Buckinghamshire cottage, John Milton was polishing Paradise Lost and Isaac Newton investigating the nature of light in a Lincolnshire farmhouse. </p> <p>The writer Rebecca Rideal had barely started work on a PhD examining how public spaces such as coffee houses, alehouses, theatres and the streets of London were changing during the Restoration, when she realised that an account for the general reader that knitted together the events of these extraordinary times simply didn\u2019t exist. There were plenty of accounts of the fire, the plague and the war, shelves full of Milton and Newton biographies, but Rideal wanted to tell these stories together. After spending her 20s working as a TV producer, it seemed natural to forge these initial thoughts into a book proposal, and suddenly, alongside a PhD, Rideal found that she was writing a book.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing is I\u2019m a procrastinator,\u201d she says, \u201cand the way that I combat procrastination is by coming up with something that in my mind is even more important than the thing I\u2019m supposed to be doing. So I start something and that takes over everything, and then I start something else.\u201d</p> <p>Sitting in the seclusion of a book-lined nook in publisher Hodder and Stoughton\u2019s smart new building on London\u2019s Victoria Embankment, Rideal clearly remembers the moment when she realised a job in TV wasn\u2019t for her.</p> <p>\u201cI was sitting in a development meeting and recently there\u2019d been those awful programmes on TV like Benefits Street \u2013 all of those things. The way the meeting was going was that they wanted to tap into those types of programmes. It\u2019s not something I felt comfortable with at all,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t come from a rich background. It wasn\u2019t the type of television I wanted to be making, or even discussing from a distance, because it\u2019s not a distance \u2013 we\u2019re all in the same society together. So that kind of made me think.\u201d</p> <p>Born in Chester in 1983, Rideal studied history at Leeds and had been pursuing her interest alongside her TV career, first with an MA at University College London and then by founding <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryvault.co.uk/\">The History Vault</a>, an online magazine exploring less familiar corners of the past in essays, book reviews and interviews.</p> <p>When a friend was accepted to study for a doctorate, Rideal found herself \u201cgreen with envy\u201d. It was enough to set thoughts of applying for a PhD herself in motion, and having fallen in love with 17th-century England as a sixth-former, the period she wanted to study was never in any doubt.</p> <p>\u201cDuring my English A-level, one of the plays that we focused on was The Way of the World. It just struck me, at that young age, the language and the way people were talking about different topics, the interactions between men and women. I thought: \u2018Wow, people haven\u2019t really changed.\u2019 I mean, society has changed, but the crucial things haven\u2019t really changed that much. Then I started reading the poems of the Earl of Rochester,\u201d \u2013 she laughs at the thought of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/feb/12/signior-dildo-poems-valentines-day-earl-of-rochester-swearwords\">Charles II\u2019s bawdiest wordsmith</a> \u2013 \u201cand it was kind of a downwards spiral from there.\u201d</p> <p>The book begins in the spring of 1665, among London\u2019s \u201cbarking dogs, clattering carts, calling pigeons and chattering early risers\u201d on a grey Tuesday, just three days after a grand, trumpeted procession swept through the capital declaring war on the Dutch. Alongside the lords and admirals, the famous diarists Samuel Pepys and John Evelyn, Rideal introduces a cast of less familiar names \u2013 such as the Mitchells, booksellers based in Westminster Hall, and the Taswells, a family of merchants living in Bear Lane \u2013 which she returns to over the next year-and-a-half as the city is wracked by plague, war and fire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1aa781e6c0cf9d18166fe4d1282328e138942705\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1aa781e6c0cf9d18166fe4d1282328e138942705/0_0_5367_3078/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brothel AblazeSeptember 1666, Men flock to save the \u2018House of Accommodation\u2019 during the Great Fire of London.

  "<p>When Frank Ocean broke his four-year musical silence last week to release Endless \u2013 a 45-minute visual album that saw him building a spiral staircase to a soundtrack of disjointed, avant-soul \u2013 many listeners, myself included, made an assumption. It seemed logical that Endless was the sound of Ocean unburdening himself of his more outre leanings before the release of his second studio album, a more focused commercial project that would cement the reputation he earned after 2012\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/11/frank-ocean-channel-orange-review1\">Channel Orange </a>as one of pop\u2019s most vital voices. </p> <p>With its falsetto Isley Brothers covers, ambient undercurrent and Wolfgang Tillmans electroclash numbers, Endless was intriguing. But it was more a series of curveballs than an album. It felt safe to say that, whatever it was people were expecting from Ocean\u2019s second studio effort, techno songs featuring a Samsung Galaxy phone press release being read out in a German accent were not high on the list.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/19/frank-ocean-endless-review-brilliantly-confounding\">Frank Ocean: Endless first-listen review \u2013 brilliantly confounding</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Less than 48 hours after Endless dropped, Ocean\u2019s long-delayed second studio album finally did arrive, in the form of Blonde. And guess what? That wasn\u2019t what people were expecting either. It came with sleeve artwork on which the title is spelled differently (Blond), a physical edition with a slightly altered tracklist and, if you ventured to one of the four pop-up shops in London, Chicago, LA and New York on the night of its release, a glossy magazine called Boys Don\u2019t Cry (Blonde\u2019s working title) that featured, among other things, a poem by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest\">Kanye West</a> about a McDonald\u2019s cheeseburger forming a band with a milkshake. If you felt disoriented before you\u2019d even pressed play, then that wasn\u2019t the half of it. </p> <p>Whatever you may think about Blonde, it\u2019s undeniably one of the most baffling, contrary and intriguing records put out by a major pop star \u2013 not just this year, but any year. Identifiable bangers of the kind Ocean has rattled off either for others or himself \u2013 most consistently on his 2011 mixtape <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/dec/14/best-albums-2011-frank-ocean\">Nostalgia Ultra</a> \u2013 are conspicuous by their absence. The tone is muted and introspective, full of spectral guitar and lacking not just hefty beats but any kind of percussion at all. (More than half of the 17 tracks here are without drums.) The lyrics are elliptical and fragmented, touching on adolescence and consumerism, identity and eroticism, yet lacking the sturdy narratives found on, say, Pyramids or Swim Good.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6a01adf993ae28bd3920e984688937f65f3cd499\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a01adf993ae28bd3920e984688937f65f3cd499/1352_0_2623_3280/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I ain\u2019t a kid no more\u2019 \u2026 Frank Ocean.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I ain\u2019t a kid no more\u2019 \u2026 Frank Ocean.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claudio Bresciani/Scanpix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Blonde boasts collaborators of a variety and star quality unparallelled by anything else you might hear in 2016 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce\">Beyonc\u00e9</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kendrick-lamar\">Kendrick Lamar</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/james-blake\">James Blake</a>, Amber Coffman and Radiohead\u2019s Johnny Greenwood. Yet aside from Andr\u00e9 3000\u2019s centre-stage turn on Solo (Reprise), you\u2019d barely know most of them were here. Instead they\u2019re deployed in a manner akin to session musicians or low-key production hands: Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s role on Pink + White is reduced to outro backing vocals, which demonstrates admirable chutzpah if nothing else.<br></p> <p>On first listen, Blonde appears to be a collection of loose sketches waiting to be hammered into shape by a no-nonsense producer. Good Guy consists of nothing but wobbly organ chords played underneath hurried memories of a hookup in a New York gay bar \u2013 the whole thing collapses after barely a minute. White Ferrari wanders aimlessly across a line cribbed from the Beatles\u2019 Here, There and Everywhere before a passage of semi-singing: Ocean appears to have stopped trying altogether. Those of a devilish mindset might be tempted to conclude that after finally finishing his much-hyped masterpiece, Ocean mistakenly deleted it from his laptop the night before launch, and had to frantically cobble together what he could from memory at 3am using an acoustic guitar and FX pedal.<br></p> <p>But such cynicism would be misplaced. Blonde is the sound of an artist cashing the critical cheques he\u2019s accrued with Channel Orange and taking the rare opportunity to create a record that answers only to its maker\u2019s own vision. Where Stevie Wonder was his debut\u2019s key influence, Blonde seems to have more in common with records such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/03/big-star-third-chaos\">Big Star\u2019s Third</a> or Radiohead\u2019s Kid A, where texture and experimentation are given free rein.

The lo-fi psychedelia of Connan Mockasin is perhaps the closest sonic reference point, while there are certainly nods to James Blake\u2019s sadboy electronica, Bon Iver\u2019s isolationist folk and Drake\u2019s soulful self-absorption. Yet with its Prince-like infusion of gospel and soul influences, Blonde doesn\u2019t sound all that much like any of these artists.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s no easier to untangle lyrically, an initial blur of Creole slang and Shakespearean references that eventually coalesce into hazy portraits of Ocean\u2019s youth, before fame and adulthood brought unseen pressures. \u201cWe didn\u2019t give a fuck back then,\u201d he reminisces on Ivy. \u201cI ain\u2019t a kid no more, we\u2019ll never be those kids again.\u201d<br></p> <p>Snapshots of elusive love and fleeting lust are scattered throughout, shorn of context and often told first in the present then the past tense: a glimpse of their promise before the reality of their disappointment hits. This fragmented style belies an obsession with both memory and mortality, and conjures an effect more in keeping with a novel \u2013 at times, it reminded me of Jennifer Egan\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/mar/13/jennifer-egan-visit-goon-squad\">A Visit From the Goon Squad</a> \u2013 than a pop record.<br></p> <p>The aesthetic Ocean pursues on Blonde doesn\u2019t allow for big, bold pronouncements on race or sexuality. Save for a moving shout-out over Nikes\u2019 lolloping beat (\u201cRIP Trayvon, that nigga looked just like me\u201d), Ocean sidesteps the racial politics that fuelled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/18/best-albums-of-2015-no-1-to-pimp-a-butterfly-by-kendrick-lamar\">To Pimp a Butterfly</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/24/beyonce-lemonade-review-a-woman-not-to-be-messed-with\">Lemonade</a> (although you could argue that the record makes a statement simply by breaking free of genre and attempting to usurp canonical works by white artists). Ocean\u2019s sexuality, which he has previously explored on tracks such as Bad Religion, is alluded to, but in nuanced ways: the stunning ballad Self Control opens with, \u201cI\u2019ll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight\u201d. There\u2019s no sentimental Same Love message to be found here, and elsewhere similar recollections are not gender-specific. By resisting the obvious route, the effect becomes more powerful \u2013 much like the moving Tumblr post Ocean wrote before the release of Channel Orange, the object of Ocean\u2019s affections is not important; how strongly he feels is.<br></p> <p>You could easily see Blonde as full of contradictions, and this would be yet another \u2013 how can such a purportedly personal album be so lacking in detail or revelation? But these mixed signals are not the result of slapdashery. What originally appear to be Blonde\u2019s flaws \u2013 its loose ends and ambiguities \u2013 end up as its strengths. Past and present, black and white, blonde and blond: in subsuming them all, this record serves as a subtle and moving rumination on the passage of time and the blurring of identity, with its protagonist gloriously unwilling to be defined as one thing or the other.

Free of Brussels, everything in theory is now up for grabs: environmental regulations; financial standards; workers rights; data protection laws; corporate tax rates.

He\u2019s got the contacts in Theresa May\u2019s government, and an intimate knowledge of how the machine works. Add to that the fact that Hague \u2013 Lord Hague of Richmond, to give him his full title \u2013 is also a legislator and so able to influence from the inside, and you\u2019ve got the whole package.</p> <p>Except, under the rules governing the \u201crevolving door\u201d, Hague has been barred from lobbying government for another year. What to do? Rest assured he won\u2019t be put on photocopying duty. Hague may not be able to directly petition his former colleagues \u2013 which is all that counts as lobbying under the (un-policed) rules \u2013 but he is at liberty to advise others on how to go about it, which amounts to much the same.</p> <p>Hague has joined an already crowded market of those acting as a bridge between corporations and May\u2019s government. Many of her newly appointed ministers are also from \u201cthe other side\u201d.

He's a rock star, a standup comedian</a> </p> </aside>  <p> In this 400th anniversary year of his death, the Edinburgh international festival has already featured two Shakespeare productions. Dan Jemmett\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/12/shake-review-edinburgh-twelfth-night\">Shake</a> reimagined Twelfth Night as an end-of-the-pier show and Declan Donnellan presented his punchy, sinister, Russian version of Measure for Measure. Both Jemmett and Donnellan are from the UK but, like Ostermeier, they work mostly in Europe, where directors such as Ivo van Hove are reinventing these old familiar plays with real vigour and insight, unfettered by several hundred years of performance history and the reverence that afflicts so much Shakespeare produced in England.</p> <p> Ostermeier\u2019s production, which runs for two and a half gripping hours without an interval, begins with thunderous drumming and a cacophony of noise. The Yorks celebrate their victory on the battlefield with a shindig at which almost everyone behaves very badly indeed, as if they\u2019re all auditioning for a part in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/may/23/posh-duke-yorks-review-billington\">Laura Wade\u2019s Posh</a>.

He helped the family get where they are, but he goes unacknowledged.</p> <p> It\u2019s as if the seeds of what will follow start to take root and grow in that moment. The glitter that falls from the heavens during the party remains visible on stage for the rest of the evening, still sparkling, as if in reproach, as it gets walked into the mud and blood when Richard takes control and in so doing loses control of himself. By the end, Eidinger\u2019s Richard cuts a lonely figure, battling not just an increasing number of enemies but also his own demons. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72b1098dad0b39178efa739d51991aa58d7e546f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72b1098dad0b39178efa739d51991aa58d7e546f/0_114_5760_3457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard III\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p> Not every aspect of the production works.

  "<p>Whenever I think about the dysfunctional horror of the looming presidential election in America \u2013 so weird that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/nigel-farage-donald-trump-rally-hillary-clinton\"> Nigel Farage can pop up in Mississippi</a> on the Trump campaign \u2013 I can\u2019t get Susan Sarandon or Plato out of my mind. Let\u2019s talk first about the actor. When did Plato make a decent movie, eh?</p> <p>A few weeks ago Sarandon gave a magazine interview to an overawed writer in which she set out her well-known political stall as a radical feminist who backed Bernie Sanders and doesn\u2019t think much of Hillary Clinton. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing about her I find feminist except that she\u2019s a woman,\u201d she said.</p> <p>That betrays a casual, right-on ignorance of Clinton\u2019s record over many decades, but never mind, Sarandon\u2019s distaste is shared by many educated American women. \u201cShe\u2019s a hawk, she\u2019ll probably get us into another war,\u201d etc etc, all good Islington-to-Santa Monica stuff. What was startling to me was that yet again Sarandon declined to say she\u2019d vote for Clinton in November.</p> <p>\u201cI go by issues, I don\u2019t vote with my vagina,\u201d Sarandon tells audiences. She did it again <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3728085/Susan-Sarandon-says-s-not-convinced-Hillary-Clinton-won-t-vote-vagina-Republican-Sarah-Michelle-Gellar-says-her.html\">in Australia the other day</a>. She\u2019s even hinted that she might vote Trump on the grounds that his election \u201cwill bring the revolution immediately\u201d. How flakey is that?</p> <p>All right, she\u2019s only an actor, they get paid to read other people\u2019s lines. But even though Bernie Sanders himself has finally backed Clinton with grumpy ill-grace, I keep hearing Americans \u2013 particularly younger, educated women \u2013 saying similar things: that they\u2019ll vote Trump against the \u201cWashington elite\u201d or just abstain.</p> <p>The Observer\u2019s Nick Cohen recently wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/30/donlad-trump-republicans-us-elections-dictatorship \">a belter of a column</a> mocking leading American Republicans who keep busts of Churchill on their desks as a symbol of defiant courage but don\u2019t have the guts to denounce and disown Trump, who has captured the ugly, angry party they spent decades creating for short-term gain.</p> <p>That\u2019s not quite fair on many Republicans. The Bush family and some other notables are standing aloof. Other figures have publicly stated \u2013 at political or personal risk to themselves \u2013 that they will vote for Clinton rather than for a man whose dangerous and volatile unsuitability makes him a threat to constitutional government.</p> <p>There is a pretty disheartening <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/08/where-republicans-stand-on-donald-trump-a-cheat-sheet/481449/\">list of rebels and appeasers</a>. At the party convention, Trump\u2019s beaten rival, Senator Ted Cruz, was booed for telling people to \u201cvote your conscience\u201d. Since he\u2019s called Trump \u201ca pathological liar, utterly amoral, a narcissist \u2026 and a serial philanderer,\u201d we can take him as a no.</p> <p>That makes Cruz and rejectionist Republicans better Americans than Susan Sarandon. Her arrogant emphasis on what matters to Susan seems \u2013 so far \u2013 to obscure her view of the bigger political picture, possibly to link her more closely than she might wish to the \u201cTrump the Selfie\u201d mood that is drawing millions of resentful Americans into a dark and angry narcissism.</p> <p>Which brings me to Plato. Concerned friends in the US sent me some extracts from a <a href=\"http://chironpublications.com/shop/trump/\">newly published book</a>, A Clear and Present Danger: Narcissism in the Era of Donald Trump \u2013 essays by prominent writers, academics and doctors on the polarising disorder they see sweeping their own country \u2013 while noting, as both Trump and Farage have done, that Britain\u2019s Brexit vote serves to remind us that the revolt against elites and globalisation exists in Europe too.</p> <p>A lot of this stuff has been around for decades. As a student 50 years ago I read the American historian Richard Hofstadter\u2019s essay The Paranoid Style of American Politics, in which anti-foreigner nativism could easily be harnessed against newcomers, outsiders, black people, capitalism, Jews, the usual suspects. The leftwing social critic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Lasch\">Christopher Lasch</a> published The Culture of Narcissism as a consequence of post-war consumer capitalism as long ago as 1979. In Willie Loman, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Miller\">Arthur Miller\u2019s</a> Death of a Salesman created a Trump voter in 1949.</p> <p>Lasch and Miller lived long enough to experience the Reagan presidency, its negative impacts softened by the incumbent\u2019s relaxed and sunny disposition. The prospect of a Trump victory against Clinton \u2013 always a vulnerable candidate in my book \u2013 would seriously have frightened, though possibly not surprised, them. It\u2019s been a long time coming and the Reagan/Goldwater wing of the Republican party has made the bouffant-haired Frankenstein possible.</p> <p>Ted Cruz is not alone in identifying Trump\u2019s very obvious self-absorption, the quality so grotesque it rendered him almost a stealth candidate until too late. What no one understood at first was how much his excesses would appeal to voters \u2013 not all of them poor white people whose jobs, prospects and traditions have been attacked or destroyed \u2013 who feel marginalised or threatened.</p> <p>It\u2019s part-cultural, part-economic, but it thrives in the celebrity culture we now inhabit, vastly enhanced by 24/7 social media. As harsh reality becomes more unpleasant, the temptation is to blur the edges between reality and illusion, to retreat into a magic world and the cult of self. Facebook, Google and YouTube make it ever more possible. Even the TV networks are making money out of Trump.</p> <p>Of course, Plato didn\u2019t do Twitter or have a presence on Facebook. But Andrew Sullivan, the British expat writer in the US, <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/04/america-tyranny-donald-trump.html\">wrote a piece</a> reminding New York magazine\u2019s readers how the great man had warned that \u201ctyranny is probably established out of no other regime than democracy,\u201d in terms that describe the Trump scenario very well.</p> <p>Plato was no friend of democracy (as pandering classics professors routinely fail to tell us in their TV series on Greek democracy), not least because it killed his hero Socrates. He saw it as a system that gradually expanded freedom and equality to the point where authority imploded and its ensuing disorders allow a demagogue to seize power, promising to \u201ctake back control\u201d or \u201cget our country back\u201d.</p> <p>Being of the elite himself, Plato explained, but with a populist touch, the emerging tyrant forces the now defenceless elite to compromise, flee or face retribution. Sound familiar? It certainly does. Watch those wobbling Republican millionaires shaking behind their locked gates. In an age that has delivered painful inequality in most advanced societies (unadvanced ones always have it), anger against elite wealth is very real and understandable. Which of us would not see more bankers jailed?</p> <p>Yet Trump supporters seem even more blind to his faults than Susan Sarandon or Nigel Farage. Trump still hasn\u2019t published his tax return, as all candidates have done for 40 years, and evidence emerges daily of strange financial ties/debts to Russian and Chinese interests. </p> <p>The distinction between fact and fantasy is fast eroding. Trump is behind in most polls and may be rightly thrashed in November, a fading nightmare by Christmas. He may just \u201cdo a Brexit\u201d and win. Does Farage get any of this, do you suppose? As a Poundland Trump, Farage tapped into suppressed resentment over \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d feelings, but never provided any answers beyond that magic word: Brexit.</p> <p>Yet on Wednesday night in Mississippi we saw a man whose creed is self-governing \u201csovereign\u201d states interfering in another country\u2019s sovereignty (he complained when Obama did it in the referendum), not against a candidate whose toxic rage so clearly threatens us all, but on his side. I wish I could say Susan Sarandon showed a better grip on reality. There\u2019s still time.</p>",

For Europe, this is very dramatic.</p> <p>But he was convinced more survivors would be found, adding that dogs were only useful for about the first three days, as few victims can survive longer than that without water. \u201cWe will find them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll sleep when we\u2019re back in Spain.\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4ef3cf02b954329cc5f3f1dd84b1e54c4df22f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4ef3cf02b954329cc5f3f1dd84b1e54c4df22f1/0_120_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A dog inspects a collapsed building during a search and rescue operation in Amatrice\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A dog inspects a collapsed building during a search and rescue operation in Amatrice</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Massimo Percossi/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57beb580e4b048662988ff06\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-25T09:13:38.960Z\">10.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Italy\u2019s civil protection agency said it was trying to determine how many people were staying in the Hotel Roma, Amatrice\u2019s best-known accommodation, when it collapsed. </p> <p>It had been feared that 70 people were in the hotel. </p> <p>Since then Mayor Priozzi told RAI that the <a href=\"http://www.rainews.it/dl/rainews/articoli/Amatrice-200-morti-terremoto-si-scava-ancora-tra-macerie-sindaco-cuore-spezzato-ma-risorgeremo-86ac0322-dd7e-42b0-a86c-acdd8748add1.html\">hotel had registered 32 guests at the time of the earthquake</a>.

Here\u2019s an AP report outlining some of the background of the town:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In three days, the rugged residents of the medieval Italian hill town of Amatrice had planned to hold one of their most joyful events of the year: the 50th edition of a food festival celebrating their beloved <strong>Amatriciana</strong> pasta dish, which is made from local ingredients.</p> <p>Instead, they will now be mourning the dozens dead from a strong earthquake that trapped residents in their homes as they slept.</p> <p>Due to the upcoming food festival, known as a sagra, there was an influx of visitors to the town, so it was very hard to know how many people were sleeping Wednesday morning in Amatrice when the quake struck at 3:36 a.m.</p> <p>The mayor said about 70 people had been staying in the Hotel Roma, a town landmark that has a restaurant which serves the famous pasta dish. Rescue workers pulled five bodies from the rubble of the hotel but had to halt rescue operations late Wednesday night because it was too dangerous working in the dark.</p> <p>Roberto Renzi said he was sleeping \u201csoundly and most tranquilly\u201d when he was jostled awake by the 6.2-magnitude tremor.

The Apennines is a mountain range that runs from the Gulf of Taranto in the south to the southern edge of the Po basin in northern Italy. Geologically, the Apennines is largely an accretionary wedge formed as a consequence of subduction. This region is tectonically and geologically complex, involving both subduction of the Adria micro-plate beneath Eurasia and the Apennines from east to west, continental collision between the Eurasia and Nubia (Africa) plates building the Alpine mountain belt further to the north and the opening of the Tyrrhenian basin to the west. The evolution of this system has caused the expression of all different tectonic styles acting at the same time in a broad region surrounding Italy and the central Mediterranean. The August 24, 2016 normal faulting earthquake is an intraplate event, an expression of the east-west extensional tectonics that now dominate along the Apennine belt, primarily a response to the Tyrrhenian basin opening faster than the compression between the Eurasia and Nubia (Africa) plates.</p> <p>The central Apennine region has experienced several significant earthquakes in recorded history. In September 1997, a Mw 6.0 earthquake 50 km north-northwest of the August 24, 2016 event killed 11, injured over 100 and destroyed approximately 80,000 homes in the Marche and Umbria regions.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57be282be4b048662988fd19\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-24T23:17:04.901Z\">12.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This drone footage gives a sense of the scale of damage in Amatrice, one of the towns closest to the epicentre of the quake.

He is not the first to create a foundation \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.barackobamafoundation.org/\">the Obama Foundation</a> is already at work \u2013 but he is the first to have a spouse run for the White House. Hence the uniquely awkward situation.</p> <p>Bill Clinton launched the public charity after leaving the White House in 2001. It sought to bring together governments, businesses and social groups to tackle the world\u2019s most pressing problems: health, climate change, economic development and opportunities for girls and women.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-inside-story-of-how-the-clintons-built-a-2-billion-global-empire/2015/06/02/b6eab638-0957-11e5-a7ad-b430fc1d3f5c_story.html\">The Washington Post</a> wrote last year: \u201cThe Clinton Foundation is an ingenious machine that can turn something intangible \u2013 the Clintons\u2019 global goodwill \u2013 into something tangible: money. For the Clintons\u2019 charitable causes. For their aides and allies. And, indirectly, for the Clintons themselves.\u201d</p> <p>More than 6,000 donors who have already provided the Clinton charity with more than $2bn in funding since its creation, <a href=\"http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_CAMPAIGN_2016_CLINTON_FOUNDATION?SITE=AP\">the Associated Press reported</a>. It has a staff of nearly 500 people.</p> <p>The foundation clearly means a lot to the 42nd president. Addressing staff recently, Bill Clinton commented: \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of interesting things in my life, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever done anything that I\u2019ve loved this much as this foundation.\u201d He admitted the prospect of scaling it down \u201cis like a root canal for me\u201d.</p> <h2>Has the foundation succeeded?</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.campaignlegalcenter.org/team/lawrence-m-noble\">Larry Noble</a>, general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, says: \u201cThe foundation does real work. It\u2019s not a sham organisation.\u201d</p> <p>It claims to have \u201cdramatically improved\u201d the lives of millions of people around the world. Clinton\u2019s supporters say it enabled the number of people receiving HIV/Aids medication to soar from 200,000 to 11.5 million and supported physical education programmes that helped more than 18 million students.</p> <p><a href=\"https://lauraseay.wordpress.com/bio/\">Laura Seay</a>, an academic who witnessed the foundation\u2019s work firsthand in east Africa, said: \u201cThe perspective that it is some kind of slush fund is based on a real misunderstanding of what the Clinton Foundation does. The Clintons don\u2019t take a salary from it.\u201d<br></p> <p>Seay was researching a PhD from 2005 to 2007 in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/05/congo-child-soldiers-ntaganda-monuc\">where militias roamed</a> and few aid organisations ventured. She recalled how, with Clinton Foundation funding, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/27/democratic-republic-congo-optimism\">Heal Africa hospital</a> in Goma treated 60 HIV-positive Congolese children, most of whom survived. \u201cI know teens &amp; young adults who were kids then &amp; are alive today because the Clinton Foundation saved their lives when no one else would,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/texasinafrica/status/767779911696261120\">she tweeted</a>.</p> <p>Seay, assistant professor of government at Colby College in Waterville, Maine, adds in an interview: \u201cThe Clinton Foundation was the organisation that took the risk on this. What it showed was that in really difficult circumstances you can save a lot of lives and change the way a lot of NGOs think about conflict zones. It really was remarkable.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton also used his name to negotiate with international pharmaceutical giants to slash the price of HIV/Aids drugs, Seay argues.</p> <p>The foundation has been particularly active in Rwanda but not without criticism. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/19/us/politics/rwanda-bill-hillary-clinton-foundation.html?_r=0\">According to the New York Times</a>, in 2011 it successfully lobbied Hillary Clinton\u2019s state department to approve an unconventional medical training programme there. A dispute over the plan was mediated by Cheryl Mills, who spent five years on the foundation board before switching to the state department.</p> <p>The foundation\u2019s banner event, the annual Clinton Global Initiative meeting, is a forum for philanthropists to announce funding commitments including, in 2007, $2m to help build the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/23/how-africas-fastest-solar-power-project-is-lighting-up-rwanda\">Agahozo-Shalom Youth Village</a> for orphans of the genocide and Aids.</p> <p>Speaking by phone from Rwanda, its director, Jean-Claude Nkulikiyimfura, says of the foundation: \u201cIt seems to be doing some very good work in the country. Its work in health could be extremely beneficial.\u201d</p> <p>Support from the foundation is also a superb calling card for non-government organisations seeking other partners, he adds. \u201cHaving the Clinton Foundation name in the list of donors may encourage other funders to provide support.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee3dd8b4dd1d3d6d207edf71831cf8328e58bb4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee3dd8b4dd1d3d6d207edf71831cf8328e58bb4d/0_204_4777_2867/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton speak during a student conference for the Clinton Global Initiative University on 22 March 2014, at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton at a student conference at Arizona State University in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt York/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>But is it transparent?</h2> <p>The foundation agreed to voluntarily disclose the names and donations of its contributors after Clinton was nominated to be secretary of state in late 2008, despite not being legally obliged to do so. It holds an A rating from <a href=\"https://www.charitywatch.org/home\">CharityWatch</a>, having spent 88% of its budget on programmes rather than overheads.</p> <p>Its list of donors includes Trump, who gave between $100,000 and $250,000 in 2009 and has attended a meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative. One Clinton ally, noting Trump\u2019s demands for <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-idUSKCN10X18W\">a special prosecutor</a> to look into the foundation, says: \u201cAs a donor, Trump is calling for an investigation of himself.\u201d</p> <p>However, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/24/jennifer-granholm/clinton-surrogate-spins-clinton-foundation-defense/\">the Politifact website contends</a> that the foundation violated its memorandum of understanding with the state department with three significant omissions, including not reporting a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/foreign-governments-gave-millions-to-foundation-while-clinton-was-at-state-dept/2015/02/25/31937c1e-bc3f-11e4-8668-4e7ba8439ca6_story.html\">$500,000 donation from Algeria</a> in 2010.</p> <h2>What is the main allegation now?</h2> <p>Pay for play.

It\u2019s an extraordinary proportion indicating her possible ethics challenges if elected president.\u201d</p> <p>The AP found that at least 85 of 154 people<strong> </strong>with private interests who either met or had phone conversations scheduled with Clinton also gave a combined total of $156m to her family\u2019s charities. Trump, struggling in the polls, sensed an opening and piled on. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ends and the state department begins,\u201d he told a rally on Wednesday night.</p> <p>Giuliani fumed: \u201cIt is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office. They sold access and specific actions for money. This makes a mockery of her promise to Congress and the president to keep the Clinton Foundation and the state department entirely separate. In other words, they merged the two into the Clinton family racketeering enterprise.\u201d</p> <p>But Hillary Clinton insists that the data was cherry picked from a subset of her schedule. She told CNN on Wednesday: \u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of smoke and there\u2019s no fire. This AP report? Put it in context, excludes nearly 2,000 meetings I had with world leaders, plus countless other meetings with government officials when I was secretary of state. It looked at a small portion of my time.</p> <p>\u201cIt drew the conclusion and made the suggestion that my meetings with people like the late, great, Elie Wiesel, or Melinda Gates, or the Nobel prize winner, Muhammad Yunus were somehow due to connections with the foundation instead of their status as highly respected global leaders.

Elizabeth Trudeau, a spokesperson for the state department, says: \u201cThe state department is not aware of any actions that were influenced by the Clinton Foundation.\u201d There is no proof of a quid pro quo or anything illegal.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/tag/peter-schweizer/\">Peter Schweizer</a>, author of the book Clinton Cash and a senior editor-at-large at Breitbart News, said: \u201cIt\u2019s naive to believe that people throw money at politics and don\u2019t expect something in return. They claimed there was going to be a wall between the Clinton Foundation and state department and this clearly shows there was communication between people at the Clinton Foundation and state department. There needs to be an investigation into exactly what happened and we also need legislation.

I don\u2019t think \u2018inevitable overlap\u2019 involves dual payrolls.\u201d</p> <h2>So how does the issue look?</h2> <p>Not good, especially as it fills a new vacuum in the dog days of August in which Trump has managed to avoid his usual attention-grabbing gaffes. It gives the appearance, at least, of a blurred line and intersecting interests between the Clinton Foundation and state department.</p> <p>\u201cThe frequency of the overlaps shows the intermingling of access and donations, and fuels perceptions that giving the foundation money was a price of admission for face time with Clinton,\u201d the AP report said.</p> <p>Scott Amey, general counsel at the <a href=\"http://www.pogo.org/\">Project on Government Oversight</a>, said: \u201cI think this is an example that may not be illegal but certainly should have been handled with more communication to show there was no actual or apparent conflicts of interest.</p> <p>\u201cThe question is, in giving money to the Clinton Foundation, did donors feel they deserved or were going to receive special access to Hillary at the state department? We don\u2019t know. Only time will tell. It seems some favours were called in and some minor efforts were made to provide access.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps some overlap between between the entities was inevitable. But Amey adds: \u201cOne of the biggest mistakes here is they didn\u2019t set up proper firewalls to prevent those blurred lines. I would be less sceptical if I had seen emails back from the state department saying: \u2018We can\u2019t do this, you should go through the official channels.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2485f2df79181a91d5b712f23ecec23f3611591f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2485f2df79181a91d5b712f23ecec23f3611591f/0_122_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton address the audience during the opening of the Clinton Global Initiative on 22 September 2014 in New York City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton address the audience during the opening of the Clinton Global Initiative in September 2014 in New York City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Loccisano/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Bill Clinton announced that, if Hillary wins the presidency, he will step down from the board of the foundation and it will stop accepting foreign and corporate donations.

But their power goes well beyond the aesthetics \u2013 Said uses her images to carve a space in culture for the community of artists, poets and creative women she portrays.</p> <p>We sat down with Said and three of the women she has photographed: <a href=\"https://writesrachell.com/\">Rachel Long</a>, a poet, facilitator and founder of the <a href=\"http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whatson/octavia-poetry-1001503\">Octavia Poetry</a> collective; <a href=\"http://thebluestobject.co/\">Rena Minegishi</a>, a poet and student of a master\u2019s degree in electronic music; and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/SunayanaB\">Sunayana Bhargava</a>, a poet and astrophysics student.

And also we needed a space that was just for us, so it was outside of academic institutions, which were very white, very middle class, very male. It\u2019s really important to know that just because you\u2019re making spaces, it doesn\u2019t mean you want segregation. Essentially, you\u2019re making spaces so that you don\u2019t need those spaces any more.</p> <p><strong>Amaal Said</strong><br>I was writing about difficult things that I\u2019d been told to keep hidden because the women in my family weren\u2019t proud of it or they expected people to not understand. But I felt like I didn\u2019t have a choice, because staying silent would mean internalising a lot of shame about my own body. I didn\u2019t think it was fair to keep it all in, and so writing was an act to sort through and share those really heavy feelings. The incredible thing was being heard and being told that I wasn\u2019t alone. </p> <p><strong>Rena Minegishi</strong><br>I used to write about really big, abstract things, probably because I was born in Tokyo and grew up in Beijing, and I always felt like that was my biographical tagline. I think finding communities of like-minded writers and women let me shed those preconceived notions about how my poetry should be. Now I\u2019m a lot more focused on documenting the intimate relationships in my life, like writing love poems, because I don\u2019t have to feel cliched if I\u2019m just going to read them in a room full of women. I\u2019m not as tokenised in a room full of women. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ab77ebe45fe23c15efdcd295ce98f5c0c280189e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab77ebe45fe23c15efdcd295ce98f5c0c280189e/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sunayana Bhargava\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sunayana Bhargava.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amaal Said</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Being typecast as \u2018the woman of colour\u2019</strong><br></h2> <h2><br></h2> <p><strong>Amaal Said</strong><br>Being very visible in terms of being Muslim, wearing a hijab and getting on a stage, and then being expected to say a sort of thing or have a sort of voice and to write the poem about the news, right? To write the poem about war \u2026 That\u2019s not very fair on me, because I\u2019m just a girl and I\u2019m just going through my own stuff. </p> <p>Especially being introduced: oh, look, we have Amaal Said, her work is very tragic or her work is very devastating, and I\u2019m like: devastating for who? Because, for me, it\u2019s just something else that I\u2019m working through, it\u2019s not something that cripples me.</p> <p><strong>Rachel Long</strong><br>[There is] this expectation that [\u2026] you [\u2026] should write this kind of one-voice-for-all-black-voices and it should be female. You should be talking about your rough upbringing, your working-class background, stuff like that, which I didn\u2019t necessarily want to do. </p> <p><strong>Sunayana Bhargava</strong><br>I\u2019m so much more than just an Indian woman. I\u2019m [a woman] from a fairly difficult upbringing who also happens to do other kinds of things. I\u2019m really interested in surrealism, for example. I\u2019m really interested in piecing together surreal aspects of life. That\u2019s come through in my poetry now, where I can write about far more difficult, hard-hitting things and not feel guilty for eviscerating myself on paper and writing all of these horrible things that people are like, \u201cwow, how unfeminine, how unwomanly\u201d. Because I choose the metric of womanhood for myself and nobody else can tell me what is or isn\u2019t supposed to be feminine. </p> <p>A lot of men are poets before they even walk into the room, and they never feel like they\u2019re going to be typecast in any way, shape or form. The sad thing is the way that people have tokenised people of colour or women; they\u2019ve expected them to bring certain narratives and systematically only included them if they\u2019re going to bring those narratives to the table. So you end up in a double bind here because you\u2019re like: well, I\u2019m equally as human as my male counterpart, but I\u2019m only allowed airtime if I\u2019m speaking about the ways that I\u2019m not like them, and the ways that I \u201cearn\u201d my grief and my pain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ac350eb1f7f1f0eb04ce9a8762985b496a8b6c4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac350eb1f7f1f0eb04ce9a8762985b496a8b6c4e/0_0_5333_3546/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rachel Long\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rachel Long.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amaal Said</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Rejecting the male gaze</strong></h2> <h2><br></h2> <p><strong>Sunayana Bhargava</strong><br>I find that, a lot of the time, if a man were to come up to me and say something about how I lived through a domestic abuse situation or how I managed to grow up in a violent household, they would always commend me on managing to retain some level of femininity, some level of vulnerability and softness, as if I\u2019m still palatable because I can still manage to present myself in a really feminine way. Whereas women are better at being critical and putting you on the path to what your authentic voice is.</p> <p><strong>Rena Minegishi</strong><br>A male artist can approach you under the guise of \u201chey, we\u2019re both creatives, it\u2019s an artistic collaboration\u201d \u2013 but it\u2019s not! They just want to photograph you in a way they feel is attractive. Just thinking about the ego that comes with being a male photographer \u2026 It\u2019s them thinking: \u201cRena\u2019s not a person, she\u2019s a muse. Rena\u2019s not a partner, she\u2019s just a beautiful girl in my room, she\u2019s just a subject on the other side of the lens.\u201d Why are we not seeing close-up penis shots more often? Not that I want to [laughs]. Why are we so commodified? If you have to use a conventionally attractive naked woman to make your photo worthwhile, maybe you\u2019re just not a great photographer. If you can\u2019t make an exciting photo without sexualising a woman, maybe you need to practise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0b54b3f4dffb5c41d4697837296f13f780c32f73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b54b3f4dffb5c41d4697837296f13f780c32f73/0_0_5000_7520/665.jpg\" alt=\"Rena Minegishi\" width=\"665\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rena Minegishi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amaal Said</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Advice for female artists</strong></h2> <h2><br></h2> <p><strong>Rachel Long</strong><br>Your voice is valid and necessary \u2013 that\u2019s a mantra you have to keep repeating. Because that belief gets chipped away. Read, read, read so much. Because you\u2019ll never be good if you don\u2019t read, you\u2019ll never be able to write well. Also, if you are the weirdo kid and you are on your own, you\u2019re isolated, that\u2019s really hard \u2013 but make a community any way you can, even if it\u2019s a community of two. Use the internet, just so you\u2019ve got someone to bounce ideas off when you need it. That can add a lot to your confidence \u2013 somebody who likes your work, but whom you love and trust enough that they can critique your work as well. Because you\u2019re not going to get any better without realising that you do need critique.</p> <p><strong>Sunayana Bhargava</strong><br>No matter what you\u2019re saying, people are going to tell you that there\u2019s no need for you to say it. There\u2019s no need for you to paint; there\u2019s no need for you to photograph; there\u2019s no need for you to write music, because in some way, shape or form, you\u2019re not going to be changing anything. That\u2019s all a big bargain game to make sure you never overstep your mark, never go out of yourself, never breach your remit as a woman working as a creative. So persevere to make sure you never let anybody tell you that you don\u2019t have a place in art. </p> <p><strong>Rena Minegishi</strong><br>Read more women. You will find a resonance so deep and so real once you read women poets, because they know exactly what you\u2019ve been through, they\u2019ve been talked down by male poets, they\u2019ve been erased from textbooks.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0f933d371b83d173e7449cc5e1ebe62c3b31f262\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f933d371b83d173e7449cc5e1ebe62c3b31f262/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sunayana Bhargava\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sunayana Bhargava.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amaal Said/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Owning the title \u2018artist\u2019</strong></h2> <h2><br></h2> <p><strong>Amaal Said</strong><br>I feel like I\u2019ve been fighting for the term \u201cartist\u201d for a very long time. People I\u2019ve grown up around have always tried to take away the artist label from me: you\u2019re just a daughter, you\u2019re a politics student, etc. You can\u2019t be more than one thing, but men can. For me, it literally took the publishing of the first book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/apr/27/warsan-shire-young-poet-laureate-beyonce-lemonade-london\">Warsan Shire</a> released, Teaching My Mother How To Give Birth, to be able to break down to my mother that this is what I wanted to do. I remember getting it and waving it in her face, like, \u201cLook! She\u2019s actually Somali and she\u2019s doing this! And I\u2019m not doing some kind of made-up thing!\u201d Representation matters so much. </p> <p><strong>Rena Minegishi</strong><br>I don\u2019t for a second delude myself into thinking that I\u2019m single-handedly responsible for a huge change in the creative world.

Knowing that what I\u2019ve said and what I\u2019ve experienced from my little part of the world can touch you from across the sea is why the internet and YouTube are so incredibly important. As a young Somali girl, and as a young black girl growing up in a place where there were no community services or youth groups and the nearest cinema was 30 minutes on a bus, having a space on the internet \u2013 opening yourself up to a community, sharing your work with maybe a couple of people at first, and just growing the confidence \u2013 is what it took for me to be able to say: I can do this and I\u2019m not a fraud.</p> <p><strong>Sunayana Bhargava</strong><br>I think the whole metric of how we measure change is very masculine. It\u2019s done in a very aggressive, often violent way, that you need to break borders, upheave a whole structure in order to make a difference. But that\u2019s not true at all \u2013 a lot of people unionise through the smallest things that operate over the largest distances. So, for a lot of us starting out in poetry, it was really validating to start in a digital sphere, before upgrading to what were more personal, intimate venues where you\u2019d actually perform your work. I was reading about Beyonc\u00e9 discovering Warsan Shire through YouTube, through exactly the same medium any other woman of colour would be able to access another woman of colour who\u2019s reading poetry. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b2f379d154ba965437b45cc674167ccda17a5113\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2f379d154ba965437b45cc674167ccda17a5113/0_0_1600_1064/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rachel Long\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rachel Long.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amaal Said</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Representations and self-image</strong><br></h2> <h2><br></h2> <p><strong>Rachel Long</strong><br>Amaal\u2019s not only doing something with women of colour in photographs \u2013 saying \u201cI am here, we exist\u201d \u2013 but also, crucially, her pictures are soft. They\u2019re super feminine. Often times, black women are portrayed like the mummy figure: big and huge; it\u2019s never soft. The black woman on TV is loud and brashy, she wears earrings and red hair and is really in your face. And so, through flowers and her photography, Amaal does the opposite. Even though you know that\u2019s not the way every black woman is, to see that [softness] in a photograph is stunning. </p> <p><strong>Sunayana Bhargava</strong><br>I had never felt comfortable in front of a camera, because I thought it was only going to magnify my flaws rather than finding something that I could like, but something about being in the hands of a woman that you really love and respect changed it from what would be such an interrogative experience. The idea that you could be with a woman and she could see beauty in you is an intensely vulnerable thing and something that requires a lot of trust. To be able to let Amaal take a photo of me and know that I\u2019m going to see it and I\u2019m actually going feel beautiful, is something that I think lots of women would feel is a massive thing, because they\u2019re constantly looking at distorted representations of themselves. To see a picture of yourself and be like \u201chey, this is me, I just am\u201d, I think that is beautiful.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/25/danish-born-somali-poet-amaal-said-recites-before-grief-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5x8ze\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2683382\"            data-video-name=\"Danish-born Somali poet Amaal Said recites Before Grief \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57bec3c2e4b0568600c04216\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/25/160825AmaalSaid_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/25/160825AmaalSaid.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/25/160825AmaalSaid_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/25/danish-born-somali-poet-amaal-said-recites-before-grief-video\">Danish-born Somali poet Amaal Said recites Before Grief</a></figcaption> </figure>",

Back then, there were no A*s, no \u201call coursework\u201d subjects and a good mix of abilities in our very socially diverse comprehensive school. Twenty five years on, said school has closed, friends in my socio-demographic group send their kids far away from the \u2018local comp\u2019 and the house prices have suffered accordingly (i mean they\u2019ve risen past the point where a correction makes a difference).<br><br>My take on this whenever my children ask me about it is that grades can be awfully important if you DO know what you want to do and although it\u2019s blindingly obvious, if one is sure about future direction, one should do everything in one\u2019s power to get those grades for university or professional training entry. I am in the 20-50% of people who had no idea what they wanted to do. And if I\u2019m honest, I\u2019m still in that cadre. I still have no idea what I want other than to pay off my lovely little modest mid-terrace for which I paid \u00a342,000 many years ago. In those cases, I am very unsure whether grades do matter much but the timeline to which I am working is much, much longer than most. I\u2019m not even sure whether local government is the place for me but my job is challenging, it\u2019s rewarding and I might just on occasion make a difference to the people I\u2019m paid to help. This role required a degree level qualification but the subject wasn\u2019t particularly pivotal. So in summary, do your best get your grades, but if you don\u2019t, things can develop a little more slowly depending on your choices and circumstances. <br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Domingo, Little Oakley</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Before results day I was swaying between doing A-levels or a college art course. My careers advisor at school told me I would never get a job doing art so I felt like I had to stay on at school. I didn\u2019t have enough grades for A levels so ended up going to college.

I would like to blame this on my school (which was struggling badly, was being monitored by Ofsted) due to having a continuous stream of substitute teachers in science/maths in the most important year. Ultimately, I would blame myself, I was in the top sets, but it just bored me and I would no do any studying, and would even avoid lessons I disliked (Drama, RE, English). Once I got the results after taking the exams, it hit me about how bad I had done, that coupled with not just hanging out with my friends as much kinda sent me into some overthinking depression about how I had ruined my life.</p> <p>The reality is, GCSEs can be important, but also matter very little. I am now an Engineer within aerospace, which If I'm honest happened accidentally, and has propelled me up. My school did nothing to push people into engineering, I honestly can't even remember if we ever studied anything on it, but if it did, I would have most certainly had an interest in it.</p> <p>I guess my main point should have actually said, University/College courses are so varied these days, that you can literally get on them with years in industry experience, most wont even care if you got a D or worse in Maths, if you can at least backup that you understand it. They are more understanding to slackers in school who grew up.

Have you got the results you need to get there? If you haven\u2019t, it\u2019s not the end of the world, but take it for the lesson it is \u2013 either that\u2019s not for you, or you didn\u2019t try hard enough. You will face more exams in life.

Hold onto that feeling and remember it when you\u2019re face down in revision in the coming years. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Paul Clark, teacher</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Are grades the holy grail of secondary school? Grades open a few doors. They give you a few more choices. However, they do not map out your future. They do not give you eternal joy or guarantee you success in life. They do not make you healthy and fulfilled. The choices that grades give you are still yours to make. You will learn more from the process of making those choices than by the results themselves.

Their children will go through exams, but of the medical kind. This does not mean those children do not achieve. Indeed their achievements are plentiful and extraordinary, but they are mostly hidden. There is no day in their life where everyone wants to know how they did. Their achievements go unnoticed, except by a small few.</p> <p>And to those of you who didn\u2019t get the letter on the page you were hoping for. There is achievement elsewhere in life that can\u2019t be measured.

They do, however, matter. Ironically, it\u2019s actually the young people who face the most barriers to academic achievement who benefit most from good grades.</p> <p>For kids at prestigious public schools, failing their GCSEs or A-levels might be embarrassing but it will never be life-ruining. They always have other options. Perhaps their dad can give them a cushy role in his own business, bypassing the need for university altogether. Possibly, they might redo the year, with the help of expensive one-to-one tutors. Or maybe they\u2019ll pursue a career in music or the arts, the financial support of their parents enabling them to undertake a series of unpaid internships to get their foot in the door.</p> <p>For young people without these advantages, it can be harder to recover from disappointing results. Partly, it\u2019s a self-confidence thing. People from very privileged backgrounds tend to have such a surplus that they\u2019re able to weather a few knocks. Also, though, the reality is that bad grades <em>do</em> limit your options somewhat.

  "<p>A lot of people have been upset by images of French police forcing a woman to take a burkini off on a beach, in full view of the public, in accordance with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/25/burkini-ban-sarkozy-calls-swimsuits-a-provocation-that-support-radical-islam\">controversial French burkini ban</a>. There are many reasons to be outraged by this ban: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/france-burkini-ban-secularist-equality-muslim\">the suppression of individual rights and apparent hypocrisy in the name of \u201csecularism\u201d</a>, the misogyny-tinged policing of women\u2019s clothes specifically, the public display of intimidation, and so on. </p> <p>All of these complaints are misplaced. The real problem with the burkini ban is, it\u2019s too limited. Forbidding a specific type of swimsuit won\u2019t achieve anything: we must ban ALL CLOTHES! And the sooner the better.</p> <p>This may sound like a ridiculous notion. But, more ridiculous than banning a swimming costume in order to fight terrorism? I think not! Plus, there are many scientifically valid reasons for us to do away with clothes. </p> <p>Firstly, clothes cause problems. Look at the long history of clothes being used as <a href=\"https://vixgoestocollege.wordpress.com/2012/04/25/victorian-fashion-the-corset-bounded-oppression-of-women/\">a tool of oppression and control</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/the-burkini-ban-what-it-really-means-when-we-criminalise-clothes\">often resulting in political problems</a>. If we didn\u2019t have clothes, we wouldn\u2019t have the means to use them to make people\u2019s lives harder. Even today, in these more \u201cliberated\u201d times, clothes regularly cause problems. <a href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/10/50-most-controversial-t-shirts-of-all-time/slideshow/\">How many T-shirt controversies have there been now</a>? Considering how much time has been wasted arguing over them, clothes have probably held back human advancement significantly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cbb74cdcb8ddb364413ea2aa5b23e26a577a442\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cbb74cdcb8ddb364413ea2aa5b23e26a577a442/0_331_5231_3138/1000.jpg\" alt=\"HARROGATE NORTH YORKSHIRE Cloth model dummies Monsoon shop window display woman children clothes.

None of this would have happened if we didn\u2019t have clothes. We\u2019d probably be on Jupiter by now! Admittedly, that would be depend on whether you define \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what-is-a-spacesuit-k4.html\">space suits</a>\u201d as clothes, seeing as how they\u2019d be banned, but the point still stands.</p> <p>But you don\u2019t need to cite controversy to see that clothes do more harm than good. How long do you spend agonising over what to wear every day? How long do you spend chafing in uncomfortable garments while trying to work because of some unthinking poorly-thought-out office \u201cdress code\u201d? And you dare not deviate from it, or <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-36268705\">there will be consequences</a>. So you end up spending large sums of money on things you don\u2019t like, don\u2019t enjoy and which don\u2019t really do anything useful. </p> <p>And that\u2019s without the pressure of judgment risked whenever you walk outside wearing specific clothes. How often do we hear people ask \u201c<a href=\"https://www.psychologistworld.com/bodylanguage/psychology-of-clothing-dating-dress.php\">what do your clothes say about you</a>?\u201d Ever-changing fashions and clothing choices have just added another layer of stress and paranoia to a world which has plenty of that as it is. </p> <p>There are other benefits to banning clothes. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/apr/29/eco-appliances-energy-saving-hints-for-washing-machines\">environmental damage caused by constantly washing</a> them would be drastically reduced, as would the financial cost of doing so. Everyone would suddenly have more money available, and no need to spend it on clothes! So it would be doubly good. </p> <p>Let\u2019s not forget the societal benefits. It may be a difficult adjustment at first, but when you consider that most people who practice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2016/mar/11/big-fat-shame-obesity-media-biology-shaming\">body shaming</a> or often less-than-perfect specimens themselves then removing the ability to hide your flaws behind opaque cloth could result in more tolerance and sensitivity between people. And if the human obsessions with looking good persists, people would have to work harder to make their own bodies more \u201cpresentable\u201d by keeping in shape. The health benefits to all and reduced pressure on medical services that would result from this cannot be understated. </p> <p>Admittedly, there\u2019d be some downsides, at least at first. Quite a few <a href=\"http://teehunter.com/2013/02/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-clothing-industry-today/\">industries would collapse and livelihoods would be ruined</a>, so the economic impact would be harsh.

Although we\u2019d have to carefully monitor the wearing of them, to make sure no woman breaks the arbitrary and questionable rules of what\u2019s acceptable. Can\u2019t see that being a problem though. </p> <p>Granted, some clothes offer protection, but when you consider it will be virtually impossible to conceal weapons, the safety risks and benefits will hopefully cancel each other out.</p> <p>There would also need to be some serious revaluation of our <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2011/11/the-psychology-of-nakedness/\">social norms</a>, especially our sexual attitudes, but <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/199707/why-nudist-dont-get-erections\">we\u2019d get used to it eventually</a>.

  "<p>Thirty years ago, the Swan theatre opened with Barry Kyle\u2019s ritualistic revival of this rare tragicomedy by Fletcher and Shakespeare, written in 1613. Now, to celebrate the theatre\u2019s birthday, it has been given a new production by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/05/blanche-mcintyre-stage-director-accolade\">Blanche McIntyre</a>, who, in her RSC debut, takes a clear line on the play without solving all its problems.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/gallery/2016/jul/14/rsc-swan-theatre-in-pictures\">The RSC Swan theatre - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The plot is palpably derived from <a href=\"https://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~chaucer/teachslf/kt-par0.htm\">Chaucer\u2019s The Knight\u2019s Tale</a>. In a nutshell, Palamon and Arcite, two imprisoned Theban warriors, both fall for Emilia, who happens to be the sister-in-law of their captor, Theseus. While the play seems to celebrate chivalric values, McIntyre underscores its erotic strangeness. Theseus is visibly closer to his bosom buddy Pirithous than to his bride to be, Hippolyta. Palamon and Arcite, for all their rivalry, are also joined at the hip: \u201cWe are one another\u2019s wife,\u201d says Arcite, and both treat the adored Emilia as a fantasy object. McIntyre mercilessly exposes the play\u2019s blokeish camaraderie, and shows that women, however much idealised, are its inescapable victims.</p> <p> All this is well done and helps to unify the rambling, jointly authored story. Although the critic James Agate once said the big question was \u201cWhich of them did it?\u201d, it is now widely accepted that Shakespeare wrote the play\u2019s first and fifth acts and John Fletcher most of the rest. What is strange is that McIntyre seems more at ease with the lesser writer.</p> <p> The magnificent, unequivocally Shakespearean opening scene, in which three widowed Theban queens beg Theseus to take up their cause, is here incomprehensibly gabbled. When it comes to the last act, McIntyre also inexplicably shortens the final speech. We don\u2019t get Theseus\u2019s concluding lines \u2013 \u201cLet\u2019s go off / And bear us like the time\u201d \u2013 which, as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.english.ox.ac.uk/about-faculty/faculty-members/permanent-post-holders/bate-sir-jonathan.html\">Jonathan Bate</a> has pointed out, are not only Shakespeare\u2019s last words for the stage but also capture the contradictoriness of a resolution that brings sorrow and laughter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75bd9f9724a4c087096ba71c1a40fa22e82eb44c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75bd9f9724a4c087096ba71c1a40fa22e82eb44c/346_592_5414_3248/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Allison McKenzie as Hippolyta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman scorned \u2026 Allison McKenzie as Hippolyta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Donald Cooper</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Textual oddities aside, McIntyre\u2019s production is well staged. Anna Fleischle\u2019s design deftly combines the sense of an Athenian arena with the portable prison walls that encage the play\u2019s heroes. The performances are also lively. James Corrigan lends Palamon a narcissistic neurosis and Jamie Wilkes endows Arcite with an acerbic wit that prevents the two men seeming easily interchangeable. There is even a certain spiritual coarseness to Corrigan\u2019s Palamon, which leads him to offer money to the father of a girl he has driven mad as if he were tipping a waiter.</p> <p> But it is the women, however much abused, who are the most interesting. The show part is the jailer\u2019s daughter who loses her wits for love of Palamon, and who Danusia Samal plays, for all the obvious echoes of Ophelia, with just the right injured innocence. Frances McNamee also brings out excellently the sexual confusion of Emilia who, having once fallen for a girl, now finds herself passed between the play\u2019s two heroes like a coveted parcel.</p> <p> Allison McKenzie, meanwhile, brings a rigour to Hippolyta, who is clearly furious at being marginalised by the bisexual Theseus. McIntyre makes a case for the play, but her production would be far stronger if it paid due attention to Shakespeare\u2019s uniquely unmistakable voice.</p> <p>\u2022At <a href=\"https://www.rsc.org.uk/the-two-noble-kinsmen/about-the-play\">the Swan theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon</a>, until 7 February.

Farage himself emphasised the idea of an insurgent political force taking on the establishment.</p> <p>He did not endorse Trump, but made plain his distaste for his Democrat foes, condemning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/24/leave-campaign-obama-trade-warning-eu-referendum\">Barack Obama\u2019s decision to intervene</a> in the EU referendum to urge Britons to vote remain.</p> <p>\u201cI could not possibly tell you how to vote in this election,\u201d Farage said, \u201cbut I will say this, if I was an American citizen I wouldn\u2019t vote for Hillary Clinton if you paid me.\u201d</p> <p>The speech indicates Farage is not entirely committed to a quiet retirement. As a man who has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/11/nigel-farage-withdraws-resignation-as-ukip-leader\">promised to step down as Ukip leader more than once</a> only to return, he has thus far said he could return to frontline British politics only if the government delayed too long on invoking article 50, which begins the formal timetable for EU departure.</p> <p>The slightly modest CVs of his would-be replacements \u2013 second-favourite Lisa Duffy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lisaduffy1968\">boasts on her Twitter profile</a> that she chairs the Christmas lights committee for the 8,000-population Cambridgeshire town where she is a councillor \u2013 will prompt more speculation that Farage\u2019s taste for the limelight will lead him to come back yet again. </p>",

  "<p>The EU and Turkey are poised for a fresh round of diplomacy in an attempt to keep their migration pact working, despite the rancorous downward spiral in relations since Ankara\u2019s crackdown on tens of thousands of people it says are supporters of the exiled cleric it blames for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/whats-happened-in-turkey-first-hours-of-the-coup\">failed military coup</a>.<br></p> <p>The two sides will reach a moment of truth in September, when the European commission is due to report on whether Turkey has done enough to gain visa-free travel to Europe\u2019s borderless Schengen zone, a linchpin of the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/08/eu-turkey-refugee-deal-qa\"> migration deal</a>.</p> <p>A delegation of EU officials is expected in Ankara in the coming weeks to assess Turkey\u2019s progress, while a visit by the EU commissioner responsible for migration, Dimitris Avramopoulos, is also being discussed.<br></p> <p>The diplomatic move comes amid an increase in migrants crossing the eastern Mediterranean to Europe. In August, 109 people a day on average have been arriving on Greek shores, compared to 62 in July, although still far below January\u2019s tally of 2,000.

Save the Children reported this week that Greek refugee camps were bursting at the seams: people are living in dirty and unsafe conditions, as camps lack sufficient drinking water, showers and toilets.</p> <p>Under the pact with Ankara, Europe promised an initial \u20ac3bn aid for Syrian refugees in Turkey, in exchange for being able to send back irregular migrants who had arrived in Greece. The deal was sweetened by the promise of visa-free travel for Turks throughout continental Europe.<br></p> <p>But even before the botched coup in Turkey, the deal had been hanging by a thread with Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, insisting he would not re-write Turkey\u2019s counter-terrorism laws - a key condition of the visa deal.</p> <p>Officials from both sides working on the visa deal insist it is viable, despite deteriorating EU-Turkey relations in the aftermath of the failed coup. Selim Yenel, Turkey\u2019s most senior diplomat in Brussels, believes a visa agreement in October is still possible, although he said \u201cemotions are still very high\u201d.</p> <p>In the weeks before the coup, both sides had met to search for compromise on Turkey\u2019s anti-terror laws, which are so widely drawn that journalists and opposition figures are targets. \u201cWe have gone through a lot of wordings [on the counter-terrorism law] that would be appropriate for us and sufficient for the EU,\u201d Yenel told the Guardian. \u201cWe haven\u2019t finalised it but it is doable.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/whats-it-like-living-in-turkey-one-month-after-the-failed-coup\">What\u2019s it like living in Turkey one month after the failed coup?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe feel that if the commission gives a green light in its report in September, then the council [of ministers] will most probably go ahead and the assumption is that the European parliament will also say yes.\u201d<br></p> <p>The ambassador, who returns to Ankara in September, also said he couldn\u2019t imagine Turkey adopting the death penalty, which the EU opposes, arguing there was no majority in the Turkish parliament for capital punishment.

The EU has warned Turkey that re-instating the death penalty would end its membership hopes. </p> <p>The two sides are also at odds over money.

The intention of the visa liberalisation benchmark has never been to reduce Turkey\u2019s capacity to fight terrorism effectively, quite the contrary,\u201d he said in a written answer to the Guardian.</p> <p>Kati Piri, a Dutch Socialist MEP, who works on EU-Turkey relations in the European parliament, did not share this optimism.

Does she see herself paying it off anytime soon? \u201cIn the next 20 to 30 years,\u201d she told the Guardian. She is 24.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s one of the reasons why she ended up writing Financial Slavery. While in college, she was asked to write a poem about debt and ended up writing about it as a form of slavery. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2rWzD0nuKI\">poem</a> remains at the core of the play. In it, Pierce describes student debt as \u201cthe twenty-first century slave ship\u201d and the people issuing loans as the new slave masters. </p> <p>She recited the poem: \u201c[The slave master] is always saying how we on this ship, because we special, that we financial slaves going to the new world and there no cotton-picking fields no more. These are dollar-picking fields, where all we gotta do is go to college with our ankles chained to our wrists for four years and \u2013 bam! \u2013 we will be free.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2rWzD0nuKI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p2rWzD0nuKI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Yet instead of being free, college graduates tend to end up thousands of dollars in debt that can take decades to pay off. </p> <p>Does she feel that equating slavery and student debt is too much? Pierce says she wants to start a dialogue. \u201cI can understand how audience members may say that the comparison is too far. When researching and receiving stories from people about their student loan journey, the language used were feelings of feeling trapped, locked in chains, heavy, and too much weight,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cWith those feelings used as inspiration and my belief that the student loan debt system is used as a 21st-century oppressive tool in a patriarchal society, and it involves socioeconomic status, race, et cetera, that this connection makes sense. This connection has a lot of weight, and when it takes a 24-year-old 30 years to pay off their student loan debt, that individual is in \u2018chains\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Ashley Krushinski, one of the actors, is about to begin her second year at a private university. She finished her freshman year with $22,000 in student loan debt. For her sophomore year, she had to take out another $25,000 loan \u2013 slightly higher than last year\u2019s since her tuition went up by 2.59% this year.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWe are in chains.

We are never going to break free,\u201d one character says in the play. </p> <p>To make their case, Pierce and the cast use various statistics and numbers throughout the performance. But it is the stories of the characters and the actors themselves that connect with the audience. </p> <p>Over the past couple of years, Pierce has taken her play around some college campuses and high schools and asked the audience how they felt after watching the play. The most common responses were depressed and sad. As a result, Pierce said that the crew workshopped it to \u201cmake it less painful\u201d and to evoke a sense of solidarity.</p> <p>\u201cThey actually say that they have hope. That they feel a type of solidarity, that they are not alone,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cToo often we feel like that because it\u2019s such a hush-hush issue.

Yes, education is important, but should going to college result in mountains of debt? Should tuition keep going up? Who is responsible for knowing exactly what the interest will amount to? Should we talk about the cost of books, meal plans and housing that often add thousands of dollars on top of tuition? Would people be willing to pay more in taxes if tuition were free? </p> <p>At one point of the play, a clip from Hillary Clinton\u2019s convention speech played for the audience.</p> <p>\u201cBernie Sanders and I will work together to make college tuition-free for the middle class and debt-free for all,\u201d Clinton says in the clip. \u201cWe will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt.\u201d</p> <p>According to Pierce, this election has already helped bring the issue of student loan debt to the forefront. </p> <p>\u201cThis is the biggest political, social, economic crisis \u2013 and issue \u2013 for our generation,\u201d said Pierce. \u201cSo if you really want to tap into our generation, our vote, you have to hit something we are passionate about, and that\u2019s student loan debt.\u201d</p> <p><em>As part of FringeNYC, Financial Slavery will have four more performances from 23 to 27 August at the Flamboyan Theatre in downtown Manhattan.</em></p>",

John Lennon famously called this song Elvis\u2019s \u201cBing Crosby moment\u201d. Fair enough.

Disorienting and consoling at the same time. You\u2019re not here.

  "<p>When news broke earlier this year that Marvel were not, <a href=\"http://tvline.com/2016/03/23/marvel-captain-britain-tv-series-not-happening/\">contrary to excited reports</a>, pursuing a new TV series based on the cult superhero Captain Britain, there rose a tumult of distress from middle-aged comic-book fans in all corners of these fair isles. Or at least from the tiny number who remembered Marvel UK\u2019s colourful but short-lived defender of Albion, a superhero who once protected former British prime minister Jim Callaghan from \u2019orrible Nazi bad guy the Red Skull, but was unable to save the Labour leader from electoral defeat at the hands of a far more evil supervillain: Maggie Thatcher.<br></p> <p>Despite being a rare Marvel effort written by the British comics legend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/alan-moore\">Alan Moore</a> \u2013 known for such seminal fare as Watchmen and V for Vendetta \u2013 Captain Britain always seemed to pale in comparison with his better-known US cousins in the 1980s, when I followed his adventures. Perhaps it was something to do with being given the rather prosaic name Brian, or maybe it was the hero\u2019s off-putting aristocratic background, but I never warmed to him in the way I did to Spider-Man or the Hulk. Superheroes somehow seemed more vibrant when they hailed from the larger-than-life United States of America, while Brian (from Maldon in Essex, home of Maldon sea salt), seemed a little dull by way of comparison.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/24/guardians-trailer-russia-superheroes-soviet-government\">Russian superheroes fight for Soviet government in Guardians trailer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And yet the very existence of Captain Britain serves to remind us that superheroes are not an exclusively American cultural phenomenon. Japanese studio Toei Films has released scores of low-budget live action comic-book-inspired movies stretching back to the 50s. And with the current Hollywood craze for superheroes, the rest of the world looks increasingly determined to play Marvel and its rivals at their own game. (Well, they certainly can\u2019t do much worse than DC Films, purveyor of painful 2016 comic book clunkathons <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/man-of-steel-2\">Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/suicide-squad\">Suicide Squad</a>.)</p> <p>Russia\u2019s effort is the austerely titled <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/24/guardians-trailer-russia-superheroes-soviet-government\">Guardians</a> (<em tabindex=\"-1\">Zaschitniki</em> in Russian), about a group of men and women from different corners of the former Soviet Union who have been subjected to a DNA-augmenting programme that gives them special powers. One of them even transforms into a giant, machine-gun-wielding bear in a moment of not-so-subtle patriotic symbolism.

A new trailer suggests local special effects experts are not far behind their Hollywood counterparts, though the attempts at Whedonesque superhero badinage are a little weak, to say the least. Perhaps something was lost in translation, but the bit where one hero asks where his costume is \u2013 and is then shown transforming into a musclebound, machine gun-wielding human-ursine hybrid \u2013 isn\u2019t quite up there with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_FZ7fVsDyY\">the \u201con de roof\u201d Spider-Man reveal</a> in the brilliant trailer for Captain America: Civil War. </p> <p>Perhaps India\u2019s answer to The Avengers can score a few more points. The Mumbai-based studio Graphic India is planning a live-action movie based on Chakra the Invincible, a superhero who harnesses the power of energy nodes to fight crime. Film-makers have even recruited none other than nonagenarian Marvel legend <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/feb/19/stan-lee-the-greatest-storyteller-in-history\">Stan Lee</a>, creator of Spidey and the Fantastic Four, to help with its homegrown version. Vikramaditya Motwane, whose 2010 debut, Udaan, was selected to compete in the Un Certain Regard category at the Cannes film festival, will be taking charge of the cameras. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a fan of Bollywood films and am really excited about launching Chakra the Invincible as my first Bollywood superhero movie,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.hitfix.com/the-dartboard/stan-lees-chakra-the-invincible-to-become-live-action-movie#SjRjTfXWkkqhZhg1.99\">Lee told Hitfix in April</a>. \u201cVikramaditya is an amazingly talented film-maker, who I have no doubt can make the Chakra film a massive hit in India and around the world. I only hope he remembers to include my cameo!\u201d</p> <p>Of course, everyone knows that China is the movie market that matters, with box office receipts in the world\u2019s most populous nation predicted to overtake their North American equivalent as soon as next year. Marvel directors the Russo brothers <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://deadline.com/2016/05/russo-brothers-china-superhero-film-1201752585/\">recently announced plans to produce a Chinese superhero origins movie</a>, titled Hero\u2019s Awakening, especially for the local market.

The closest thing to a successful homegrown superhero appears to be last year\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Chinese-Superhero-Pancake-Man-Coming-United-States-73077.html\">Pancake Man</a>, a self-reflexive comedy about a poor street vendor given miraculous powers thanks to his excellent snacks. The film was a huge box-office success in China, and yet you get the impression somebody, somewhere is taking the mickey. </p> <p>Pancake Man\u2019s only real powers are his skill with an egg, which rather undercuts the western obsession over costumed crimefighters with godlike powers. But perhaps the Chinese are on to something here, and comic-book movies with less ostentatious heroes are the way forward. At least then Captain Britain \u2013 Brian to his mum \u2013 would finally stand a real chance.</p>",
  "<p>On one view, the rise of natural philosophy over the last several millennia has slowly stripped man of his God-given dominion over creation and squeezed the human species into a tiny corner of the cosmos that, through accidents of physics, chemistry and evolution, happens to be our home. The diminishment of humankind is a trajectory that I find terrifying and exhilarating and it continues apace in Ed Yong\u2019s masterful new book, I Contain Multitudes<em>,</em> which tells the stories of the microbes that swarm within and around us.</p> <p>While we might preen at how far we have come in the past few thousand years, the whole of human history is but the work of a moment next to the three or four billion years that microbes \u2013 mostly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria\">bacteria</a>, but also their cousins among the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaea\">archea</a> and single-celled <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote\">eukaryotes</a> \u2013 have ruled the roost. This is the point around which Multitudes pivots: precedence matters. The multi-celled animals and plants that emerged late in life\u2019s story had to find accommodation on a planet where every niche was already occupied by invisible microbes. They had no choice but to interact, bodily and genetically, and through the blind thrashing of evolution, with the Earth\u2019s microbiome. And we are only now discovering the extraordinary reach of the web of interactions spun from those turbulent processes. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/25/gut-reaction-surprising-power-of-microbes\">Gut reaction: the surprising power of microbes | Ed Yong</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The central idea is so obvious and so obviously important that we are stung like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Henry_Huxley\">Huxley</a> on learning of Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution by natural selection: \u201cHow extremely stupid not to have thought of that!\u201d The idea is not Yong\u2019s, of course \u2013 it has emerged from over a century of research, much of it very recent. But he had the wit and the skill to wring from this mass of observations a tale that shifts our personal cosmology once more (informing us along the way that we have more bacteria in our guts than there are stars in the Milky Way) and compels us look anew at the world. </p> <p>Multitudes starts out in the middle of the seventeenth century with Leeuwenhoek\u2019s discovery, using his superior microscope, of tiny <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animalcule\">animalcules</a> in a drop of pond water, and alights briefly on the well-known work of Pasteur and Koch who were central to the germ theory of disease that still dominates most people\u2019s thinking about bacteria \u2013 their reputations remain mostly unfriendly. It fell to the microbial ecologists of the twentieth century to rehabilitate bacteria as a normal component of the planetary scheme of life. Though some microbes are parasitic and pathogenic, many have developed symbiotic relationships with their hosts. And as researchers have delved deeper, particularly since adding DNA sequencing to their toolkit in the 1970s (which makes it relatively easy to identify individual species and to catalogue their genetic and molecular capabilities), the richness and complexity of those relationships has produced surprise after surprise.</p> <p>From this treasure-trove of research Yong pulls story after story: how luminescent bacteria colonise and control the development of light-emitting organs in the Hawaiian bobtail squid; how the beewolf wasp (since long before Fleming chanced upon penicillin) squirts its larvae with bacterial paste to give them the protection of antibiotics as they transform into adults; how human babies are slathered in microbe-infested mucus as they are delivered through their mothers\u2019 vagina, the gift of life being accompanied by the gift of bugs to seed their childhood microbiome; how a mother\u2019s milk is formulated not just to feed her baby but to keep those bacteria happy too; and how the microbes in its gut may well affect how that growing child thinks and behaves.<br></p> <p>And those are just some of the naturally occurring effects. Now that researchers have started to get a grip on the world\u2019s microbes, they are \u2013 naturally \u2013 trying to find them new forms of employment. Yong has tales of how microbial transplants are saving frogs in California, or allowing cows to feed on toxic plants in Australia, or stopping mosquitos from transmitting the dengue virus, or curing humans of chronic diarrhoea. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2015/jul/25/vital-question-lifes-greatest-secret-reviewed\">Life's big surprises: The Vital Question and Life's Greatest Secret</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I do the book a disservice by just listing some of the contents \u2013 a pencil sketch of an oil painting. I Contain Multitudes presents, as the subtitle has it, \u201ca grander view of life\u201d and there are large hypotheses at play here, such as the idea of the immune system as an instrument for management of microbial co-existence rather than simply a brute defence against intruders; and of disease as dysbiosis, the result of imbalance or disharmony in the networks of our relations with different microorganisms. Things aren\u2019t quite as hokey as the tree of souls in James Cameron\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499549/\">Avatar</a> but they\u2019re more holistic than we have previously supposed. </p> <p>The book is necessarily episodic in construction but Yong keeps a firm hold of the various threads, paying out his narrative like a master navigator. He has an easy manner that is nevertheless respectful of the material and the reader. The prose is smart, canny, and often quite beautiful. Yong has an enviable knack for metaphor. Here he is describing Carl Woese\u2019s discovery of archea, one of the three great kingdoms of life: \u201cIt was as if everyone had been staring at a world map only for Woese to quietly unfold a full third that had been hidden underneath.\u201d The rise of DNA analysis in biology is rendered simply as: \u201cThe gentle caress of the cotton bud replaces the swing of a butterfly net.\u201d</p> <p>The sure-footedness of the writing is a joy, but also instills confidence, as does Yong\u2019s renunciation of the breathless wonder that sometimes infects popular science writing. He deals adroitly with the realities and incompleteness of research, dosing the text with warnings and caveats. We are carefully reminded of the limited relevance that laboratory studies may have for real world scenarios, and exhorted repeatedly not to confuse causation and correlation. And Multitudes is nicely illuminated by conversations with the \u201cgleeful, imaginative, driven scientists\u201d<strong> </strong>who have devoted their lives to investigating what is happening on the microbial front line. Yong has marvels aplenty to share, but makes room also for questions, uncertainties and disputes. This is a story that is far from finished and I would not be surprised if in five or ten year\u2019s time a new edition is required. </p> <p>Occasionally, Yong is hampered by his main players. I tripped over the long, unpronounceable Latin names \u2013 the likes of <em>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</em> or <em>Algoriphagus machipongonensis</em> \u2013 even though they are quickly neutered by abbreviation. More difficult to deal with is invisibility. Microorganisms are variously spheroid, rod-like or spiral in shape under the microscope, but remain out of sight in our daily lives, known principally by their effects on us and other creatures. These impacts are richly described in Multitudes, but even after we have become acquainted, our microbial companions feel strangely absent. Yong is not at fault here \u2013 this is simply the curse of the microbial (and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2015/jun/08/hello-your-inner-molecules\">molecular</a>) world. </p> <p>I Contain Multitudes is hardly a light read \u2013 I closed the book with the feeling that Yong has peered into <em>every</em> microbial niche \u2013 but it is an endlessly rewarding one. In the realm of the life sciences there is a noble tradition of popular books that, by synthesizing emergent findings scattered through research journals, have reshaped our view of the world, peeling away the old, familiar veneer to reveal inner workings of unimaginable intricacy. In my own reading I think of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Life%3F\">What is Life</a>, Dawkins\u2019 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene\">The Selfish Gene</a> and, more recently, Nick Lane\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2015/jul/25/vital-question-lifes-greatest-secret-reviewed\">The Vital Question</a>. Among such company, I Contain Multitudes can hold its head high.</p> <p><em>Ed Yong\u2019s I Contain Multitudes can be <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/i-contain-multitudes.html\">ordered from the Guardian bookshop</a>. </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Stephen_Curry\"><em>@Stephen_Curry</em></a><em> and his microbes are a professor of structural biology at Imperial College.</em></p>",

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s movement has often been compared to that of a rightwing European party. Now, his union with Europe\u2019s right is official. At a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/nigel-farage-donald-trump-rally-hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">rally on Wednesday</a> Trump presented himself as America\u2019s Nigel Farage, holding the former Ukip leader up as his populist, nationalist twin.</p> <p>Make it a long-lost twin for Trump, who when first asked for an opinion on whether Britain should leave the European Union <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jun/22/donald-trump-brexit-my-inclination-would-be-get-ou/\" title=\"\">appeared to be unfamiliar</a> with the referendum in question. Fast-forward to the day after the referendum, though, and Trump would boast he had predicted the British exit from the EU all along. Earlier this month he rebranded himself <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/766246213079498752\" title=\"\">\u201cMr Brexit\u201d</a> in a tweet; and now he\u2019s getting even more explicit about what promise he sees in the tale of British secession.</p> <p>\u201cOn 23 June, the people of Britain voted to declare their independence \u2013 which is what we\u2019re looking to do also, folks! \u2013 from international government,\u201d Trump told his audience in Jackson, Mississippi.</p> <p>Jackson is a place where the memory of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/17/confederate-flag-symbol-charleston-white-anxiety\" title=\"\">Confederacy</a> is still fresh, and as such a curious one in which to be touting a second <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/24/nigel-farage-eu-referendum-this-victory-for-real-people-video\" title=\"\">independence day</a>, of sorts. But such white nationalist fervour seemed to play well with the overwhelmingly white crowd assembled in the largely black city on Wednesday night.</p> <p>The architects of Brexit like to frame the vote as a righteous backlash against powerful elites. As Farage put it on Wednesday: \u201cYou can beat the pollsters. You can beat the commentators \u2026 Anything is possible if enough decent people are prepared to stand up against the establishment.\u201d</p> <p>According to this oft trotted-out framing, Trump\u2019s reviled Washington establishment is a parallel for Farage\u2019s European Commission. But the hyper-focus on anti-elitism obscures the far less righteous xenophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment that were also elements of the leave campaign.</p> <p>Such uninspiring qualities are the core of Trump\u2019s movement too, and that was apparent in no small number of crowd-pleasing lines. \u201cWhy do our leaders spend so much more time talking about how to help people [who are] here illegally than they spend trying to help American citizens?\u201d Trump asked. \u201cThe media ignores the plight of Americans who have lost their children to illegal immigrants, but spends day after day pushing for amnesty for those here in violation of the law.\u201d</p> <p>The bigotry of Trump\u2019s campaign is, if anything, more extreme. While leave campaign leaders such as Boris Johnson would at least distance themselves from the anti-immigrant rhetoric espoused by Farage and others, Trump has embraced it. And even Farage himself has <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/nigel-farage-donald-trump-republican-convention-muslims-us-election-2016-a7153206.html\" title=\"\">suggested</a> that some of Trump\u2019s anti-Muslim rhetoric goes too far.</p> <p>Trump has long harnessed America\u2019s wave of white nationalism. But with the encouragement of his campaign\u2019s new chief executive, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/stephen-bannon-donald-trump-campaign-chief-breitbart\" title=\"\">Stephen Bannon</a> (previously an outspoken Brexit cheerleader at the rightwing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/14/breitbart-writers-resign-trump-manager-assault-reporter-michelle-fields\" title=\"\">Breitbart </a>news website), he has now harnessed something else. Namely, he\u2019s enlisted Farage to help him airbrush bigotry from his message in much the same way Farage did with Brexit.</p> <p>It\u2019s telling that in the wake of Brexit\u2019s victory Farage has, rather than assuming a position of leadership, found himself stoking populist flames elsewhere. And it underscores another unspoken parallel with Trump: trafficking in the politics of anger \u2013 not governance \u2013 is what he does best. If Trump wins in November, expect more of the same.</p>",

The influx of Romanians and Bulgarians has also reached a new high, although that\u2019s offset by falls in non-EU immigration and from other central and eastern European countries. </p> <p>\u201cWork remains the main reason for migration followed by study, which has seen a significant fall in the number of people coming to the UK for education.\u201d</p> <p>White said it was important to remember that the figures only go up to the end of March and do not cover the period following the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU.</p> <p>The immigration minister, Robert Goodwill, said that reducing the number of migrants coming to the UK would be a priority for the negotiations to leave the EU. \u201cWe are also committed to reducing non-EU migration across all visa routes in order to bring net migration down to sustainable levels as soon as possible,\u201d he said.</p> <p> \u201cToday\u2019s figures demonstrate the reforms we have already introduced to cut abuse across non-EU visa routes and toughen welfare provisions are working. We are also removing more foreign national offenders than ever before and have legislated twice to stop illegal migrants operating under the radar. But there is no doubt there is far more to do.\u201d</p> <p>The Migration Observatory, based at Oxford University, said the latest figures showed that net migration to the UK had relatively stabilised before the EU referendum, and pointed to Poland becoming the top country of birth for migrants living in the UK. </p> <p>Its director, Madeleine Sumption, said: \u201cThis data comes at a time of considerable uncertainty for EU migrants living in the UK, as most EU migrants are not UK citizens. Although the government has committed in principle to allow EU migrants to remain in the UK, there are many unresolved questions about their status.\u201d<br></p> <p>Data on net migration after the referendum will not be available for some time. Figures for the period ending September 2016, for example, will be released in February 2017.</p> <p>\u201cWhile high levels of EU migration were a major theme in the referendum debate, predicting how they will change after Brexit is still an impossible task. We don\u2019t yet know what policies will apply to EU citizens after Brexit. The impact of the referendum outcome on the economy \u2013 and thus whether the UK will continue to be an attractive destination for migrants looking to work in the UK \u2013 also remains uncertain,\u201d Sumption said.</p>",
  "<p>Countries with dilapidated transport networks and unsafe power grids stand a greater risk of extreme natural events becoming humanitarian disasters, a report has found.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/apr/24/world-heading-for-catastrophe-over-natural-disasters-risk-expert-warns\">World heading for catastrophe over natural disasters, risk expert warns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Using analysis of floods, typhoons, earthquakes, tsunamis and other natural disasters, the <a href=\"http://weltrisikobericht.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WorldRiskReport2016.pdf\">2016 world risk report</a> (pdf), claims that decrepit infrastructure and logistics systems can become a \u201cdirect threat\u201d to societies because they can trap or injure victims, as well as impeding the delivery of humanitarian relief. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cOnce you have a disaster situation, you need infrastructure to deal with it in the short term and long term, to get supplies and relief into the right places,\u201d says report co-author Dr Matthias Garschagen of the UN University \u2013 Institute of Environment and Human Security, which publishes the annual reports.</p> <p>\u201cNot only are the quality and quantity of the infrastructure important, but issues of redundancy are important as well: if you only have one main highway into a disaster area and that highway is blocked, do you have a helicopter, an alternative railway line, or elephant or donkey even in really remote areas, to get there?\u201d</p> <p>Last year\u2019s series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/12/dozens-killed-as-devastated-nepal-suffers-another-strong-earthquake\">devastating earthquakes in Nepal</a> are a case in point: half a million homes were destroyed, and another 250,000 badly damaged as entire villages were reduced to rubble; roads into remote mountain regions were blocked by landslides and avalanches; power supplies were cut off and telephone lines destroyed; and eight million people, nearly a quarter of Nepal\u2019s population, needed urgent humanitarian relief. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"73134ee0a97d64b0f7b13b01213c5b236465b831\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73134ee0a97d64b0f7b13b01213c5b236465b831/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traffic bearing evacuees in Nepal is brought to a standstill after  a landslide caused by an earthquake blocked the road.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traffic bearing evacuees in Nepal is brought to a standstill after a landslide caused by an earthquake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although Nepal\u2019s international airport at Kathmandu escaped major damage, the volume of relief goods received was so high \u2013 and the road networks out to the areas affected so damaged \u2013 that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/28/nepal-earthquake-aid-food-trucks-villages-humanitarian-crisis\">aid effectively languished for days</a> in the capital as a result, leaving millions of people in need of sanitation, shelter, food and water, and urgent medical care. </p> <p>Poor infrastructure systems can also have far-reaching effects that go beyond the scope of the natural disaster itself, the report says. The 2011 floods that effectively shut down huge swaths of Bangkok also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/29/bangkok-centre-escapes-floods\">crippled the city\u2019s regional airport and deluged major industrial parks</a>, costing billions of dollars in damage and lost revenue.</p> <p>Such situations demonstrate just how much infrastructure can shape disaster risk, says Garschagen. As natural disasters have increased dramatically  and intensity over the past three decades, investment in better logistics and infrastructure systems would not only save lives but also billions of dollars annually. According to <a href=\"http://www.unisdr.org/files/47804_2015disastertrendsinfographic.pdf\">UN figures</a> [PDF], 346 natural disasters were recorded worldwide last year, killing 22,000 people, affecting another 100 million, and costing $66.5bn (\u00a350bn) in total.</p> <p>The world risk report analyses various data each year in an attempt to rate 171 countries by their disaster risk. This year\u2019s focus was on logistics and infrastructure.</p> <p>A number of developing countries, like Vietnam and Bangladesh, are now looking at designing and implementing disaster-resilient infrastructure systems, says Garschagen, taking into particular account flood patterns over the past few years and projections for the next 20 years. While this is a major step in the right direction, effective law enforcement is also needed, says Garschagen, pointing to the 2008 Sichuan earthquake in China that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/07/china-earthquake-anniversary-death-toll\">killed thousands of children when school buildings collapsed</a>, effectively because the schools had not been built to code.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c58758c6aec115cd0686ec0305fca47bae91bc3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c58758c6aec115cd0686ec0305fca47bae91bc3/0_169_3886_2332/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Partially submerged vehicles are seen stranded in floodwaters at a roundabout in Ayutthaya, north of Bangkok, in October 2011\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Partially submerged vehicles are seen stranded in floodwaters at a roundabout in Ayutthaya, north of Bangkok, in October 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christophe Archambault/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to World Bank estimates, additional investments of up to $1.5tn in low- and middle-income countries are needed annually until 2020, simply to establish an \u201cadequate level\u201d of infrastructure. This could be an opportunity for humanitarian organisations to branch out and look at investing in preventative areas instead of focusing solely on relief after a natural disaster has already occurred, says Garschagen.</p> <p>The world risk report also commends the use of new technologies \u2013 such as smart phones and drones \u2013 in sharing logistics information and mapping out relief zones, for example in the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan. But the authors warn that depending on these advances as a \u201cpanacea\u201d for disaster efforts is a short-sighted mistake.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of the humanitarian assistance from many of the organisations today are so keen to jump on these new technologies that they forget the more political story that needs to be told,\u201d says Garschagen. \u201cSmart phones and drones will only take you so far if you don\u2019t even have the basics in place.\u201d</p>",

  "<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <blockquote> <p><em>We have two types of user accounts: local and Microsoft accounts. Over the years from Windows XP through Vista, Windows 7 and up to 8.1, I have always used local accounts, where you could easily control the security of your operating system by using a password-protected standard user account. However, to get the real benefits of Windows 10 requires creating a Microsoft account. (Of course, one way to ensure privacy is to create a new outlook.com account and just use it for log in purposes.)</em></p> <p><em>From what I understand, Windows 10 automatically generates another super or elevated Administrator account during installation, and this account is hidden by default for security reasons. Unlike the normal Administrator account, this runs all programs with admin rights by default, without that annoying UAC box appearing when you attempt to run a program. What is to stop any malware installing itself on your PC?</em></p> <p><em>Also, is it best to enable the hidden Administrator account should it become necessary to access it for any reason?</em> <strong>Marcus</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>The appearance of every new version of Microsoft Windows usually creates panic in people who think they\u2019ve found something new, when it\u2019s actually something old. Windows 10\u2019s privacy settings, for example, are more or less identical to the ones in Windows 8. The email-based Microsoft Account logon system was also introduced four years ago, in 2012.</p> <p>The \u201cHidden Administrator Account\u201d has been around even longer. It first appeared in its current form in Windows Vista a decade ago, and has been in every version of Windows since. It was even in Windows XP, but you had to <a href=\"http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/how-to/windows/how-gain-access-your-windows-account-if-you-lost-your-password-3433989/\">boot Windows in Safe Mode</a> \u2013 or edit the registry \u2013 to see it.</p> <p>Windows XP was \u2013 and still is \u2013 famously insecure. One reason for its insecurity was that most people logged on using what Unix users would call a \u201croot account\u201d with the power to do anything. Unix, Linux and Unix-based Apple Mac OS X users generally used less powerful accounts, which meant any malware couldn\u2019t cause as much damage.</p> <p>Right from the beginning, Windows XP had exactly the same design, with an Admin (root) account and less powerful user accounts. Unfortunately, few people used them, partly because of badly-written third-party software that could only be installed from root accounts. Many programs had been converted from DOS-based Windows where that was the norm: in Windows 95, Windows 98/98SE and Windows ME, every user could modify everything.</p> <h2><strong>Enter the UAC</strong></h2> <p>Microsoft stopped this by introducing UAC (User Account Control) in Windows Vista. This made users run a safe user account by default. If something needed Admin privileges, UAC would grey the screen and pop up a box, asking you to escalate to Admin level. As a result, badly written third-party software popped up loads of UAC interruptions, which eventually pressurised suppliers to rewrite their software to avoid them.</p> <p>Of course, Microsoft also provided a get-out so that impatient and arrogant users could turn down the level of UACs or turn them off, making their PCs less secure. But the UAC and other security improvements still led to a dramatic reduction in the number of Windows virus infections in Vista and Windows 7.</p> <p>The \u201cHidden Administrator Account\u201d has survived because it has a purpose. It allows you to upgrade Windows 7 to Windows 10 or whatever without running into a snowstorm of UAC pop-ups. Once the operating system is installed, the hidden account is disabled. You don\u2019t need to know it\u2019s there, and under normal circumstances, you should never need to use it.</p> <p>However, you should never run a copy of Windows 7 to 10 with only one Admin account \u2013 which will usually be the first account you set up. If you use that Admin account all the time and it gets corrupted, you\u2019re in trouble. You might be able to regain access by using the hidden admin account, but that\u2019s turned off by default, and the process is obscure and prone to failure.</p> <p>So, my advice is to forget all about the Hidden Administrator Account. Instead, create a second Admin account that you can use if your original account is corrupted, or you forget the password, or something bad happens.</p> <h2><strong>User accounts</strong></h2> <p>You already know the dangers of working with a full Admin or root account. For this reason, Microsoft has provided <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17197/windows-10-set-up-accounts\">several alternatives</a> with different levels of security and control.</p> <p>All the adults that use a Windows 10 PC should have their own standard user account. As the sole administrator of one or more PCs, you can set these up by going to Start, running the Settings app and clicking Accounts. Select \u201cFamily &amp; other users\u201d from the left hand menu, and choose whether to \u201cAdd a family member\u201d or \u201cAdd someone else to this PC\u201d. If you choose \u201cAdd a family member\u201d, you then get two options: Adult and Child.</p> <p>When you add a non-family member, they should use their own MSA. That way they will have access to their own apps, but they won\u2019t have access to family information. If you set up a child account, you can have it monitored: they can only access websites and apps that you have approved, and you can set time limits and curfews. You can also provide accounts with access to school or work networks, including device management networks (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device_management\">MDM</a>).</p> <p>Further, you can provide \u201cassigned access\u201d so that a user can use only one Windows Store app, such as Skype. You could use this to enable a child to play a single game, or for gathering information, etc. For example, a club could use it for a survey.</p> <p>When you limit what people can do on a PC, you limit the amount of damage that they can do, and the amount of damage that malware can do.</p> <h2><strong>Using a Microsoft Account</strong></h2> <p>You are correct in saying that you need to log on to Windows 10 with a <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/account/\">Microsoft Account</a> (MSA) to make full use of its features. This applies whether the account is an Admin account, a standard account, or a child account, etc, and I don\u2019t think it makes a significant difference to your security.</p> <p>Windows 10 is a mobile operating system delivered and maintained from the cloud. Using an MSA enables Windows 10 to get your email automagically, and lets you save files to your OneDrive cloud. It means apps are securely installed and updated from the online Windows Store \u2013 exactly like Google Android and Apple iPhone and iPad apps.</p> <p>It means you can \u201croam\u201d, signing on with your MSA on different PCs, sync data, or get a whole new PC set up like an old one, with the same apps and settings. Indeed, a Microsoft Account also works across Xbox One games consoles, Windows smartphones, and dozens of apps on Apple iOS and Android devices.</p> <p>You are correct in saying that you can open a new email account at outlook.com for your log-on to Windows 10, and this does not require any personal information. You don\u2019t have to use it for email and, unlike Google, Microsoft does not data-mine your emails for advertising purposes.</p> <p>Alternatively, you can use a non-Microsoft email address to set up your MSA, but this gives Microsoft more information than it would get from a token outlook.com address. If you use, say, a Gmail address, Windows 10 will still work with OneDrive, Microsoft\u2019s free online Office suite and related programs. However, as soon as you click the email tab, Microsoft will create an outlook.com email service that can send emails \u201cfrom\u201d your Gmail address.</p> <p>You can also use a purely local account, without an email link. However, you will eventually end up using one with the Microsoft Store. As with the Apple and Google stores, you have to log on, even if you never intend to buy anything.</p> <p>At least the Microsoft ecosystem supports both local and cloud-based computing across all the leading platforms, stretching from USB compute sticks to giant server farms. Neither Apple nor Google does that.</p> <p><em>Have you got a question for Jack? Email it to <a href=\"mailto:Ask.Jack@theguardian.com\">Ask.Jack@theguardian.com</a></em></p>",
  "<p>This photograph is part of a&nbsp;series called Faces and Phases, which I\u2019ve been working on for a decade. It\u2019s about creating positive images of black lesbians and transgender people in South African society, and it\u2019s&nbsp;dedicated to a close friend of mine who died in 2007 at the age of 25. She was a&nbsp;so-called \u201ccurative\u201d rape survivor. I&nbsp;felt I&nbsp;needed to remember the people that were growing up in front of me, and to see myself as one of \u201cus\u201d rather than one of \u201cthem\u201d. The project is about us being counted in South African visual history. I think that\u2019s true photography \u2013 to say that you were present.</p> <p>Most of my subjects are&nbsp;friends or friends of friends, and often activists like me. I photograph people who are already out and fully understand who they are. I don\u2019t shoot people that are underage because I don\u2019t want them to risk their lives, especially if&nbsp;they\u2019re still dependent on their parents. It\u2019s too dangerous.</p> <p>I took this shot of Sinenhlanhla Lunga at&nbsp;a friend\u2019s place in the Katlehong township. I&nbsp;don\u2019t use a studio \u2013 we just threw a blanket over the fence as background. I&nbsp;think what defines this image is the gaze. It\u2019s beautiful; there\u2019s nothing superfluous. Sinenhlanhla wanted to be a professional model, but it never happened. You can have a dream of being a visible queer or trans model, but the mainstream hasn\u2019t reached that&nbsp;level of acceptance. When we last spoke, she was about to have a child.</p> <p>I\u2019m so happy that we\u2019re alive, living&nbsp;in a country that is so infested by&nbsp;hate crime. About three months ago, we had droughts in my hometown of Durban and a&nbsp;church leader said they had been caused by homosexuality and same-sex marriage. It was reported in the media, too. It\u2019s painful to me because the&nbsp;church should be preaching love. At the end of&nbsp;July, on the weekend of Durban Pride, there were storms, floods and snow \u2013 it was very strange. I&nbsp;said to a&nbsp;friend: \u201cI wonder what the church leaders are saying now?\u201d</p> <p>In the same year this photograph was taken, lots of my photographic equipment and my computer was stolen from my apartment in Cape Town. It was a backlash against my work, and it was a double blow because I lost a lot of unpublished material.</p> <p>One of the most challenging things about being a queer visual activist in South Africa is not having access to spaces to exhibit my work here \u2013 where it would be most important \u2013 even as I&nbsp;gain recognition abroad. The attitude of politicians towards LGBTI people fluctuates a lot. When one of us has been killed \u2013 or there are elections \u2013 you find a lot of support, and then when it\u2019s&nbsp;over they come up with a different agenda. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to have our own people in politics, in medicine and in the media.</p> <p>Faces and Phases will carry on as long as I live \u2013 we are growing up together.

While correctly excluding the Got to Give It Up sound recording itself, the court erroneously allowed the Gayes\u2019 experts to testify about the sound recording anyway, including by playing their own musical excerpts based on the sound recording.

Amy asked if I was having a stroke, to which I answered: \u201cThere\u2019s no way, I\u2019m too young and healthy.\u201d When she questioned again, I uttered the immortal words: \u201cI should know, I\u2019m a doctor.\u201d</p> <p>It was so painless and gentle that I thought little of it at the time. I was tired and perhaps overstressed. Pressures of work and maintaining a life balance had perhaps been taking their toll. My first consideration was that this was a Bell\u2019s palsy, which involves a virus in the nerve endings in the face causing them to go offline for a while. This can be brought on by stress and not looking after yourself, so I felt it fitted what was happening. As it was late and I had to get up early the next day for work I thought I\u2019d sleep on it and reassess in the morning.</p> <p> At breakfast the next day the severity of the situation hit. I read up on the symptoms over breakfast and saw that if your eyebrows were still working (as mine were), this was far more serious. The potential option list read: brain tumour, multiple sclerosis and stroke. </p> <p>Four days, one brain scan and a battery of tests later at the hospital in which I work, I had been diagnosed with an embolic stroke. I was 34, a marathon runner, recently married, a junior doctor and had no risk factors. This wasn\u2019t meant to happen to me.</p> <p>The immediate aftermath of the diagnosis was a proverbial rollercoaster of emotion, an odd combination of a doctor\u2019s curiosity about the disease process and a strange inability to think. The shock, interest and well wishes of the outside world contrasted with the suffocating moments on my own wondering if another would happen; the sense of bafflement that this could have happened to me and the painful realisation that it had. One memory I have is being struck by how life can literally change in a heartbeat, even when lying in bed. </p> <p>I had gone into work a doctor on the Monday and returned home a patient on Tuesday. The transition was seamless. One day I was helping others, the next I needed help myself.</p> <p>One of the greatest lessons it has taught me so far is something that no amount of study in medical school could have prepared me more \u2013 being ill is often a profoundly lonely process.</p> <p>While we study and work hard to understand the objective reality of disease with its variety of pathology and manifestations, we can only ever understand what is happening with half the information. The other half is what that disease means to the patient.</p> <p>A huge element that defined my own recovery from the stroke was the post-stroke fatigue. The tiredness was like something I\u2019ve never experienced. Boiling an egg became an exercise in total concentration; I could only talk to people for 10 minutes before feeling shattered. Some days, getting out of bed was almost impossible. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/views-from-the-nhs-frontline/2016/mar/07/junior-doctor-patients-dont-know-i-have-cancer\">Junior doctor: my patients don't know I have cancer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Becoming a patient, but also retaining the identity of a doctor, allowed for a duality of perspective. One part of me was able to step back and observe and be interested by what was happening. Another lived and breathed the tough new reality I found myself in. No one could really understand what I was going through. Illness and recuperation became a lonely place, with some days much harder than others.</p> <p>The desire to be listened to is powerful. One thing I learnt was how suffocating it could be to be given answers such as \u201cdon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be ok\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s happening for a reason\u201d when others perhaps didn\u2019t know what else to say.</p> <p>Among many things, this has taught me the value of just being there to listen and support, without the need to necessarily control the situation and only offer solutions. This is something that as often over-stretched doctors we do not always feel we have time for, but the value of it can never be underestimated. I hope to take this back into my own personal life and professional practice \u2013 both with loved ones and future patients.</p> <p><em>Giles Dawnay has self-published a book about his experience on Amazon \u2013<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Brushstrokes-Thoughts-reflections-having-stroke/dp/1533198624?ie=UTF8&amp;ref_=asap_bc\"> Brushstrokes \u2013 Thoughts, poems and reflection on having had a stroke at the age of 34</a></em></p> <p><em>If you would like to contribute to our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/series/blood-sweat-and-tears\">Blood, sweat and tears series</a> which is about memorable moments in a healthcare career, please read our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2015/jul/14/healthcare-workers-tell-us-about-memorable-experience\">guidelines</a> and get in touch by emailing <a href=\"mailto:sarah.johnson@theguardian.com\">sarah.johnson@theguardian.com</a>.</em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/healthcare-professionals/?CMP=dis-166\">Join the Healthcare Professionals Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

  "<p>The literary calendar is marked by big public events: writers\u2019 festivals, book fairs, and the announcements first of shortlists and then of winners of major awards. For Australian writers and readers, the Miles Franklin is a lodestone, our Big Award, the one that celebrates not just writing, not just fiction, but particularly and peculiarly Australian writing. Since 2013 it has been accompanied by the second literary award to be named for Stella Maria Sarah Miles Franklin: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/19/charlotte-woods-the-natural-way-of-things-wins-50000-stella-prize\">the Stella prize</a>, established to recognise women\u2019s contribution to Australian literature. </p> <p>This year, it seems to me, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/may/29/women-and-melbourne-writers-dominate-miles-franklin-2016-shortlist\">the Miles Franklin shortlist</a> entirely honours the founder of the award, not only because four of the five novelists are women, but also because each of the novels, in its own idiosyncratic and nuanced way, reflects and represents Australian life, presenting as that \u201cindigenous literature\u201d (Franklin\u2019s term) that prevents people from being \u201calien in their own soil\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/may/29/women-and-melbourne-writers-dominate-miles-franklin-2016-shortlist\">Women and Melbourne writers dominate Miles Franklin 2016 shortlist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The novels do not, though, offer a comfortable or consoling rendition of Australian life. If anything, they turn their lenses on alienation, and on the weight of the ordinary occasions of everyday life, as well as the larger scale complexities \u2013 of, say, the sociopolitical landscape \u2013 that bear down on individuals. </p> <p>This makes them sound a bit \u201cworthy\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d, novels that take as their task the imperative to instruct readers about The Human Condition. But in fact each is remarkably readable; each writer has a wonderful sense of story and its elements: character, pacing, setting and, yes, even plot. Any would be a worthy recipient of this prestigious award. Let me tiptoe through them in alphabetical order.</p> <h2>Hope Farm by Peggy Frew</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5ccff9fc5f55469a05ae1f194b3035a5919bc8cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ccff9fc5f55469a05ae1f194b3035a5919bc8cc/0_0_1594_2480/643.jpg\" alt=\"Peggy Frew\u2019s Hope Farm.\" width=\"643\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Peggy Frew\u2019s Hope Farm is set in 1985 Gippsland, and narrated by Silver, daughter of Ishtar who \u2013 as a pregnant teenager \u2013 fled the petit bourgeois morality of 1970s Queensland that would have forcibly removed her baby from her, for the uncertain support of a local ashram. </p> <p>The story unfolds on the ironically misnamed Hope Farm, a communal property occupied mainly by feckless incompetents. Ishtar and Silver may be misfits, but they are neither feckless nor incompetent; and their arrival, along with that of Ishtar\u2019s new man, Miller, initiates an unravelling of that decaying place, that compromised community. </p> <p>There are the expected conflicts \u2013 children v adults; bullies v bullied; male v female; parent v child \u2013 but they are delivered with a clarity and tenderness that takes readers beyond the surface impression of, say, snotty child or slovenly adult, to the fullness, the complexity, of any individual or group of individuals. </p> <p>I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying \u201credemption\u201d in relation to this novel \u2013 and indeed this is not a redemptive story in the classical sense \u2013 but it does offer a stage on which Silver, her equally misplaced friend Ian and her shining glorious damaged mother Ishtar can begin to feel their way beyond mere survival, and toward a more endurable life.</p> <h2>Leap by Myfanwy Jones</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"187740104d346a5dfec680ca344abad99c3d0cfc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/187740104d346a5dfec680ca344abad99c3d0cfc/0_0_1807_2457/735.jpg\" alt=\"The cover of Myfanwy Jones\u2019 Leap\" width=\"735\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>With Leap Myfanwy Jones has crafted a lyrical account of mourning, and the long, lonely, difficult work of building sufficient scar tissue over the wounds of bereavement to allow mourners the possibility of moving on. Much of this work is couched in terms of physical being: the parkour through which Joe, muted by the death of his girlfriend Jen, is feeling his way back into the world; or the stillness, the compulsive observation, that Jen\u2019s mother, Elsie, uses as her connection to memories of her daughter, to the idea of being alive. </p> <p>Cats are important metaphors in this novel: the cat leap that Joe is learning to perform; the tigers that have captured Elsie\u2019s imagination; the \u201ccatlike containment\u201d of the mysterious nurse who moves into the spare room in Joe\u2019s share house; Jen\u2019s intention to have tiger stripes tattooed on her leg. Cats as a way of thinking about being: it worked for me. </p> <p>The novel is moving; the language poetic; the morphology of grief very believable.</p> <h2>Black Rock White City by AS Patric</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b5cb737fb12fa9ffb8d7557068abd7e0e137f2a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5cb737fb12fa9ffb8d7557068abd7e0e137f2a5/0_0_2336_3584/652.jpg\" alt=\"AS Patric\u2019s Black Rock White City.\" width=\"652\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>With Black Rock White City we are again in the company of grief: loss, bereavement, trauma. Of the central characters, AS Patric\u2019s narrator says, \u201cNeither of them is sure about the present but this is some sort of afterlife.\u201d Jovan and Suzana, refugees from the war in Sarajevo, have left their lives behind, along with the bodies of their little children: \u201cTheir names were Dejan and Ana. And there\u2019s nothing more that can be said about the dead that doesn\u2019t make them small, lost and forgotten.\u201d</p> <p>They are living now in the sort of afterlife you find in mythology: grey, and sad, and haunted by the shades of all they have lost. Even Jovan\u2019s name has been lost in this new country (\u201cJo \u2026 Ja \u2026 Joh-von. Ja-Va. Ah fuck it, we\u2019ll call you Joe.\u201d But of course we never entirely lose or escape our past. The idea of war has come with them. Dr Graffito, who defaces the walls of the hospital with violent phrases, is a metaphor as well as an actuality of violence and death. </p> <p>But Patric does not leave Suzana and Jovan there; slowly, tenderly, they begin to emerge into this new country and all its possibilities.</p> <h2>Salt Creek by Lucy Treloar</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"49d8d63772b6a2b4561388629009343228acb086\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49d8d63772b6a2b4561388629009343228acb086/0_0_1600_2421/661.jpg\" alt=\"The cover of Lucy Treloar\u2019s Salt Creek.\" width=\"661\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Lucy Treloar\u2019s Salt Creek treads the sort of ground broken a few years ago by Kate Grenville and her Secret River. Set in the Coorong in South Australia and peopled by the Finches \u2013 a large and ever-expanding family whose father cannot find the balance between ideal and action \u2013 it\u2019s narrated by Hester, the eldest daughter and the one who is required to provide the through line for the family, including cooking and cleaning and supporting her depressed mother and caring for the little children. </p> <p>What I found compelling was not the story of Hester\u2019s endurance, but rather the way Treloar depicts the relationship between the local people and the Finches: the stupidity and carelessness, the casual brutality with which the settlers treat the Indigenous owners of land to which they have laid claim; and the way some of the Finch children begin to connect, however inadequately, with some of the local people. One of the rare sunny spots in the novel is provided by Tully, a local youth, who is adored both by Addie, Hester\u2019s lighthearted sister, and Fred, her artist brother. And yes, it ends in tears.</p> <p>Indeed, this particular colonial adventure generally ends in betrayal, brokenness and disappointment; but to say this so bluntly is to ignore the beauty of the language, the lightness with which the historical context is carried by the story, and the vivid presence of the physical environment, which is as fully realised as are the central characters.</p> <h2>The Natural Way of Things by Charlotte Wood</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"128979debe8bb38bed479ebf6104289d9dbbbcf4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/128979debe8bb38bed479ebf6104289d9dbbbcf4/0_0_1807_2456/736.jpg\" alt=\"The cover of Charlotte Wood\u2019s The Natural Way of Things.\" width=\"736\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/19/charlotte-woods-the-natural-way-of-things-wins-50000-stella-prize\">Charlotte Wood\u2019s The Natural Way of Things</a> in equal parts captivated and appalled me. Built out of the actuality of the Hay institution for girls, an institution established for the punitive constraint of adolescent \u201coffenders\u201d, this novel operates as a dystopic fable of the control of women and women\u2019s sexuality. The 10 young women who suffer \u201cthe natural way of things\u201d have all been the subjects of very public sexual scandals. They have been kidnapped and enslaved and brutalised by the agents of a vaguely identified corporation, Harding International. </p> <p>Their heads shaved, their clothes exchanged for heavy boots and rough dresses and their eyes and arms under constraints, the women find themselves \u201cabducted right into the middle of the nineteen fucking fifties\u201d. The necessarily \u201cbald and frightened girls\u201d and their dull abusive captors gradually adapt to this bizarre life, in a Waiting for Godot situation where day after day Harding International fails to arrive. But how does anyone adapt to the impossible: to authorised misogyny, to absent rights? They don\u2019t, of course; they simply find ways to accommodate themselves to it. </p> <p>In those accommodations we see the crippling of selves; the ambiguous comfort of friendship; the giving over of personal values for tiny physical ease. While there are fleeting gestures towards a sense of sisterhood, only two characters really come out of it with any honour: Yolanda, betrayed by her beloved brother, named \u201clunatic\u201d, but able to hunt and kill, and thus keep everyone alive for a time; and Verla, who is able to use her brain, and thus to some extent keep them comparatively functional. It is gruelling to read, shattering. It is important.</p> <p>-</p> <p>Novels build in their readers a capacity for empathy, we are told. These five novels do precisely that, and besides are lovely to read \u2013 each writer has a feeling for sentences and phrases, and has built in such narrative traction that I read them at a gulp, emerging only at the end, blinking, before returning to the everyday. These novels are scored through by sensitivity, clarity, and a ruthless generosity of voice, and feel their way into character, into ethical complexities, and into the small and large ways our society creaks on. </p> <p><em>\u2022 This article is co-published with <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/touching-ferocious-and-poetic-the-miles-franklin-shortlist-is-worthy-of-your-attention-64428\">The Conversation</a>.

Burrowes, MP for the neighbouring Enfield Southgate, smiled but agreed. \u201cIt is beautiful because of the freedom it brings, the safety,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is beautiful in that sense.

Volunteers say though the system is slow, there are now official routes in place to help Syrians claim asylum in France or help children reach families in the UK. </p> <p>Around 30 Syrian boys have been reunited with their families in the UK, through the work of Safe Passage. But for others, no such systems exist. Volunteers are particularly worried about unaccompanied young girls, mostly from Eritrea, whose numbers are growing, with up to 50 now in the camp. </p> <p>Were they to decide to claim asylum in France and move to the official housing, only six beds for young women are on offer and volunteers say many young asylum seekers of either sex are regularly turned away, despite being actively encouraged to claim asylum in France. </p> <p>Johnny Willis, a volunteer co-ordinator with Help Refugees who runs the camp\u2019s brightly painted youth centre, said he had had 10 asylum seekers turned away by the authorities in one day. </p> <p>\u201cStaying in France is the only safe thing we can really recommend.

  "<p>You may have budgeted for your next overseas city break away, but you could still be in for a shock if your hotel charges city tax. The tax can add up to \u00a312 a night to the cost of a double room, and you may only be presented with the bill when it\u2019s time to check out. <br></p> <p>City tax is charged on hotel stays across many European cities including Paris, Berlin, Rome, Amsterdam and Barcelona, and in some more far-flung destinations, such as Dubai and America. Rates and charging structures vary, but can go up to \u00a36 per person per night. </p> <p>Bob Atkinson from TravelSupermarket.com says in some cities you can expect to pay on a per person, per night basis, while in others, such as Berlin, Amsterdam and Cologne, city tax is charged at a flat rate of 5% of your hotel room bill. You may have to pay for your children too \u2013 in Berlin, for instance, their stay is taxed, while in Italy there are usually exemptions for the under-14s or under-16s.</p> <p>Paris is relatively cheap, says Atkinson, with charges from 20 cents to \u20ac1.50 (\u00a31.30) per person per night, based on hotel location and star rating. In contrast, in Rome you can pay up to \u20ac7 per person per night, he says, which works out at more than \u00a380 for two people if you\u2019re staying for a week. </p> <p>It\u2019s generally hotels that charge city tax, according to Atkinson, as \u201csmall private accommodation tends to be exempt and stays at Airbnb seem to avoid it in some places, although Paris is one city where it must be collected\u201d. Once again, there are quirks in the system: in some places, including Cologne and Berlin, business travellers are exempt from the tax, and in Italy children under 14, (or 16 in some places), can be exempt.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In some cities payments go to supporting the local tourist industry and developing it, such as in Cologne</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While you may think this is a sneaky way for hotels to boost their coffers, the money doesn\u2019t go directly into their pockets, although where it goes varies too. \u201cIn some cities payments go to supporting the local tourist industry and developing it, for example, in Cologne,\u201d says Atkinson. But in Italy the tax is used to \u201craise revenue for hard-pressed government departments\u201d. <br></p> <p>In the Catalonia region of Spain where city tax has been in operation since 2012, it has raised a total of \u20ac126m, which has been split between the Catalan Tourism Agency, local tourism boards and town halls.<br></p> <p>Since July, the Spanish government has charged a new \u201ctourist tax\u201d on hotel stays in the Balearic Islands, which include Mallorca, Ibiza, Formentera and Menorca. It\u2019s charged at a rate of up to \u20ac2 per person per night, depending on the type of accommodation, and is collected by the hotel. The upper rate applies to four- and five-star hotels; you may only pay \u20ac1 a night if you\u2019re staying in a basic holiday apartment. </p> <p>As city tax isn\u2019t an issue in the UK, holidaymakers heading abroad may easily be confused about whether it has already been included in their holiday price if they\u2019ve booked a package deal, or whether they need to save some money to cover this. Sean Tipton from ABTA, the group representing travel agents, says the basic rule is that \u201cany locally collected taxes, which includes city tax, won\u2019t be included as part of your package\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a04ff140195599cc70d28a424e6c88946510880\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a04ff140195599cc70d28a424e6c88946510880/0_220_6108_3663/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ibiza\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the Balearic Islands, including Ibiza, the government charges a tourist tax of up to \u20ac2 per person per night, depending on the type of accommodation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This means it is up to you to cover the cost on arrival or departure at your hotel, which could be a shock if you haven\u2019t read the notes with your booking.</p> <p>Budget flight company Jet2.com confirms that the tax isn\u2019t included in its city breaks packages and should be paid locally at the hotel. It says it warns customers upfront: \u201cWe notify customers when they book, and they have to tick a box to say that they\u2019ve read this.\u201d Details are also contained in Jet2\u2019s terms and conditions.</p> <p>Both Thomson and First Choice also say city tax (if levied at your destination) isn\u2019t included in package prices, adding, \u201cwe advise customers they are chargeable on arrival rather than included in the package price\u201d.</p> <p>If you\u2019re booking accommodation independently, check you read the hotel\u2019s website carefully, including details of any city tax charges. While these should all be listed \u2013 sites such as Booking.com put details alongside the room listing \u2013 it can be possible to spot the room rate, think you\u2019ve got a bargain and forget to factor in the extra costs. In most cases you can pay any tax due on departure, by cash or card.</p> <p>While city tax isn\u2019t an issue in the UK, Camden council did propose a form of a tourist tax last year to help with street cleaning, in the wake of government cuts. Camden was suggesting a \u00a31 a night tax on hotel stays in central London, but imposing such changes would mean new legislation being brought in.

A curved screen bends down towards the sides and a glass back is rounded in a similar fashion to the front. There is a small metal band around the outside. Side-by-side the only obvious difference is that the Note 7 is very slightly larger.</p> <p>It\u2019s 7.9mm thick, 153.5mm tall and 73.9mm wide. The S7 Edge is 0.2mm thinner, 2.6mm shorter and 1.3mm narrower. The Note 7 is also 12g heavier at 169g, with the stylus docked. The differences are negligible in use, which makes the Note 7 one of the easiest big phones to use, and makes its chief rivals, the Apple iPhone 6S Plus and Nexus 6P, look positively fat in almost every dimension bar thickness - the iPhone and Nexus are both 7.3mm thick.</p> <p>The curved screen edges are more aesthetic than functional, but help to maintain a narrow width which makes holding the Note 7 so much easier than almost any other phablet. It feels great in the hand, with a level of refinement in the edges, materials and shape beyond any previous Note.</p> <p>The 5.7in quad HD AMOLED screen is one of the brightest, clearest and best I\u2019ve ever seen on a smartphone, with inky blacks and bold colours. It\u2019s clearly visible outdoors, which is remarkable for the often easily washed out OLED-based screens, and is even better than that fitted to the already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/11/samsung-galaxy-s7-edge-review-android-smartphone-phablet-marshmallow\">excellent S7 Edge</a>.</p> <p>The Note 7 is also waterproof to IP68 standards which means 1.5m for 30 minutes in fresh water. The ports are open, which means no fiddly doors, including the stylus slot and its S Pen, which can now work underwater on the screen too.</p> <h2>Specifications</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Screen:</strong> 5.7in quad HD AMOLED (518ppi)</li> <li><strong>Processor:</strong> octa-core Samsung Exynos 8890 or quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820</li> <li><strong>RAM:</strong> 4GB of RAM</li> <li><strong>Storage:</strong> 64GB + microSD card</li> <li><strong>Operating system:</strong> Android 6.0.1 with TouchWiz</li> <li><strong>Camera:</strong> 12MP rear camera with OIS, 5MP front-facing camera</li> <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> LTE, Wi-Fi, NFC, USB-C, wireless charging, Bluetooth 4.2 and GPS</li> <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 153.5 x 73.9 x 7.9 mm</li> <li><strong>Weight:</strong> 169g</li> </ul> <h2>Wireless charging and one day\u2019s battery</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"996b90f47a70e6f6a785669f9504864b22c3ec54\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/996b90f47a70e6f6a785669f9504864b22c3ec54/0_0_4005_2403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"samsung galaxy note 7 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The blue and gold Note 7 is very attractive in the flesh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Note 7 has the same processor, graphics and amount of RAM <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/11/samsung-galaxy-s7-edge-review-android-smartphone-phablet-marshmallow\">as the S7 Edge</a> and performs similarly.</p> <p>Like the S7 Edge, the Note 7 is snappy and rapidly crunches through pretty much anything you might throw at it. It feels particularly sprightly loading and switching between programs. Split-screen multitasking also doesn\u2019t slow it down, although the utility of it on a 5.7in screen is debatable.</p> <p>Battery life is slightly disappointing. The Note 7 charges really fast, hitting 70% in 50 minutes via the included USB-C fast charger, but the battery won\u2019t last much more than a day without special treatment.</p> <p>Using it as my primary device, listening to five hours of music via Bluetooth headphones, browsing and using apps for three hours with hundreds of push emails and 30 minutes of light gaming, the Note 7 lasted from 7am on day one until 8am on day two.</p> <p>Wireless charging worked well overnight on a 5W pad built into a piece of furniture. Battery-saving modes, including those that monitor apps and put those you don\u2019t use to sleep to prevent them using power, are built in and I found battery life to slowly improve as that process rolled along.</p> <p>It\u2019s also worth noting that battery life is expected to increase by around 10%-20% with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/22/android-7-nougat-review-battery-life-multitasking-operation-notifications-facial-recognition-android\">roll out of Android 7.0 Nougat</a>.</p> <h2>TouchWiz</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"541d26d23c9448d03559f261cea1be5384285a08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/541d26d23c9448d03559f261cea1be5384285a08/0_0_4454_2671/1000.jpg\" alt=\"samsung galaxy note 7 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The apps, people and task edge slides out from a small tap on the side of the curved screen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Note 7 runs the same modified version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/22/google-android-6-0-marshmallow-review-longer-battery-life-now-on-tap-apps\">Android 6.0 Marshmallow</a> called TouchWiz <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/11/samsung-galaxy-s7-edge-review-android-smartphone-phablet-marshmallow\">as the S7 Edge</a>, but with additions to support the stylus.</p> <p>Most of Samsung\u2019s modifications to Android are good, particularly as Android 6.0 Marshmallow is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/22/android-7-nougat-review-battery-life-multitasking-operation-notifications-facial-recognition-android\">now out of date</a>. It has more quick settings, more power-saving modes including a system to identify and put unused apps to sleep, extensive control over notifications including the power of the vibration, and a built-in blue light filter for nighttime use.</p> <p>The small audio output settings in the notification shade allow you to switch output between various Bluetooth devices, headphones and the internal speakers, without having to disconnect anything.</p> <p>A collection of small edge utilities are available, useful for quickly accessing contacts or apps, but little beyond that. They can be removed if you do not find them useful. Samsung\u2019s gaming tools can record game footage, stop notifications or buttons from disrupting play and can limit the smartphone\u2019s performance to save battery power. You can minimise a game without pausing it too.</p> <p>It\u2019s not all good, however. The Upday social news aggregator panel on the homescreen (which replaced Flipboard on earlier Samsung phones) I found irritating so I turned it off. I also suffered a bug with Samsung\u2019s new Cloud sync service, which backs up the phone\u2019s contents to Samsung\u2019s free 15GB cloud storage, which caused the Android media server service to rapidly drain the battery.</p> <p>Media server bugs are common with Samsung smartphones, usually associated with corrupted images particularly on SD cards, although not in this case as I did not have a microSD card installed at the time. Turning off Samsung Cloud syncing was the only solution to the battery drain I could find. It is likely the result of using a pre-release device; it got several updates in the time I had with it.</p> <p>Microsoft\u2019s Office, Skype and OneDrive apps come pre-installed, which can be disabled but not uninstalled.</p> <h2>S Pen</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e366d19477b6773ab4037e8c04700937e9babb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e366d19477b6773ab4037e8c04700937e9babb1/0_0_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"samsung galaxy note 7 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Writing short notes while the screen is off is very handy as a digital post-it note.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The rest of Samsung\u2019s software tweaks to Android are to support the S Pen stylus, which is one of the best small styluses available. The pressure-sensitive nib is significantly smaller than previous versions, which makes it feel more accurate, while the whole system is very responsive as long as you\u2019re using a Samsung app.</p> <p>Using the stylus in Evernote, for instance, a little bit of lag was noticeable but the feel on the screen has also been improved making it much more like drawing on paper.</p> <p>Samsung\u2019s new Notes app collects together most of the stylus features in one place. Hand-drawn notes, text, handwriting recognition, audio and images can be collated and synced with Samsung Cloud, but sadly not Evernote like Samsung\u2019s older S Notes.</p> <p>You can use the stylus to make quick selections of text for translation, screen annotations and use a solid collection of productivity tools. The S Pen works on the screen when the phone is asleep, which is saved to Samsung Notes and can be pinned on the screen like a post-it note.</p> <p>All the stylus\u2019s features can also be used when the screen is wet, which means it can be used underwater, if you really want. When not in use the stylus docks neatly into the phone.</p> <p>The stylus is quite useful for drawing small diagrams, sketches or handwritten notes, but not much more than that. But it does have one killer new feature: instant gif making. You can record an area of the screen to make a gif of up to 15 seconds. </p> <h2>Fingerprint scanner</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20b1bb2ef9fd8402a0d8c681c3b9d23f01815172\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20b1bb2ef9fd8402a0d8c681c3b9d23f01815172/1_0_4315_2590/1000.jpg\" alt=\"samsung galaxy note 7 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The fingerprint scanner doubles as a home button, with the USB-C port - a first for a Samsung phone - immediately below it.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fingerprint scanner on the front is the same as the Galaxy S7 Edge and is solid, recognising my fingers and thumbs instantly most of the time.

  "<p>If you demolish a historic building in Timbuktu you commit a war crime. If you demolish one in Britain you apply for retrospective planning permission. What is the difference?</p> <p>The decision of the international court in The Hague this week to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/21/ahmad-al-mahdi-trial-the-hague-timbuktu-cultural-destruction\">prosecute a former al-Qaida insurgent, Ahmad al-Mahdi</a>, for destroying nine ancient tombs in Mali is deeply significant. For the first time, the concept of war criminality has been extended from killing people to trying to wipe out their cultural heritage.</p> <p>In 2012 al-Mahdi led a band of jihadis in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/02/mali-islamists-attack-world-heritage-mosques-timbuktu\">systematic destruction</a> of relics of Mali\u2019s ancient culture of pluralism, claiming it as an offence to Islamic fundamentalism. Timbuktu\u2019s three mosques and its mausoleums were the great treasures of Saharan Africa, a culture that flourished at the time of Renaissance Florence. Despite the efforts of their custodians, manuscripts and books dating back to the 13th century were lost. Unesco\u2019s director general, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jun/03/irina-bokova-un-unesco-world-heritage-palmyra-isis\">Irina Bokova</a>, called the attack part of \u201ca genocidal project, an attempted annihilation of otherness\u201d. The mayor of Timbuktu said the shrines \u201cbelong to the whole world\u201d.</p> <p>In theory, the definition of a war crime has long gone beyond killing. It embraces torture, rape, the use of certain weapons and the destruction of property. Conventions in 1954 and 1977 specifically extended the protection of international law to \u201ccultural property\u201d, including sites, monuments, museums and art works. A <a href=\"https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/INTRO/590\">1999 protocol</a> set out criminal sanctions covering such matters.</p> <p>Prosecutions were never brought. This was partly for fear of appearing to elevate objects above people, but also because few hands are clean in this matter. No action was taken over the 1993 demolition by Serbs of Bosnian mosques and other historic structures. No action was taken in 1999 over Nato\u2019s senseless bombing of historic structures in Novi Sad in north Serbia. Britain itself has never even ratified the 1954 convention, despite promises as recently as in last May\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech. It is believed the RAF lobbied against doing so.</p> <p>In other words, the Hague case could open a can of worms \u2013 and with luck will do so. One of the most depressing books I have read is Robert Bevan\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/351135/\">The Destruction of Memory</a>. From Cort\u00e9s in Mexico to Britain\u2019s bombing of historic L\u00fcbeck and the retaliatory Baedeker raids in the second world war, Bevan records systematic attacks on heritage targets as integral to military conquest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b2ab135b9f9cdcda0b23d453326e1d1b18efc8be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2ab135b9f9cdcda0b23d453326e1d1b18efc8be/0_118_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ahmad al-Mahdi on trial at the international criminal court in The Hague.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ahmad al-Mahdi on trial at the international criminal court in The Hague.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: POOL/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In case after case - mostly recently the Taliban in Bamiyan and Isis in Palmyra - wiping out the culture of a hated people was a means of subjugating them. Even in peace, communist regimes knew that destroying old buildings played a part in countering the conservative enemy within.</p> <p>The jihadis\u2019 destruction of Islam\u2019s past may have seemed appallingly systematic. But its effect on the ground was no more appalling than the reckless western, and now Russian, aerial bombardment of urban targets in Iraq and Syria. Some 50,000 bombs and missiles have fallen on these countries since 2003. The tally of civilians killed by such bombs is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/18/opinion/does-the-us-ignore-its-civilian-casualties-in-iraq-and-syria.html?_r=0\">almost certainly greater than those killed by Islamic State</a>. The cultural devastation cannot be computed. America standing by during the firing and looting of Baghdad\u2019s library and museum during the 2003 invasion was in flagrant defiance of the Hague convention. It makes al-Mahdi\u2019s crime seem almost petty.</p> <p>Timbuktu\u2019s assiduousness in pursuing its case reflects the complex relationship of all countries to their past. Old places are not simply relics for scholars. Millions visit historical sites because they see them as exemplars of continuity and stability amid change. As Bevan points out, that conquerors so crave their destruction is a measure of their significance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jun/03/irina-bokova-un-unesco-world-heritage-palmyra-isis\">Irina Bokova: the woman standing between Isis and world heritage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I like old places not because I always find them beautiful \u2013 many are not beautiful while some new buildings are. Rather I prefer the display of the old as illuminating the new. It pleases the eye and stimulates memory. It is older quarters of towns that nowadays attract crowds. This applies even where they have been drastically rebuilt. If the 19th century had not restored so many gothic cathedrals and old towns, 21st-century Europe would be immeasurably the poorer.</p> <p>Historic buildings possess the same cultural vitality as do great sculptures and paintings. We have international laws governing the restitution of art to its owners. The Hague prosecution suggests that we might treat destroyed old buildings the same, protecting them in time of war and restoring them to their cities if damaged afterwards.</p> <p>Warsaw rebuilt its old square, Dresden its Frauenkirche and the National Trust its fire-damaged Uppark. It is to Unesco\u2019s credit that it has already used local craftsmen to rebuild the shrines smashed by al-Mahdi, even if it cannot recover their books and contents. By prosecuting those who did the smashing, the court greatly strengthens the case for such rebuilding.</p> <p>Yet a new fundamentalism is emerging, that of \u201chistorical authenticity\u201d. Unesco still cannot make up its mind to restore the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/10/rebuild-bamiyan-buddhas-taliban-afghanistan\">Bamiyan buddhas</a>, even though parts of them were already copies.

The future of old Aleppo faces those caring for Syria\u2019s past with a clear choice: to restore as in Warsaw, or to \u201cmodernise\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If a vase is broken we do not leave it unrepaired. Why treat a building or a whole culture more harshly?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Our debt to the past is growing more complicated than either wiping it out or putting up fences and charging for entry. The challenge is constant. In Britain this week, Liverpool is demolishing its earliest cinema, <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/demolition-historic-futurist-cinema-begins-11697085\">the Futurist</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/06/grimsby-kasbah-demolition-threat-fishing-industry-golden-ageregeneration\">Grimsby</a> seeks to wipe out the legacy of its maritime dockside. The cause may be development value rather than war. The loss to communal memory is the same.</p> <p>If a vase is broken or a picture slashed we do not leave them unrepaired. Why treat a building or a neighbourhood or a whole culture more harshly, when we now have the means and the skills to repair them? To retreat into some ideological \u201ctruth to materials\u201d or \u201cconserve as found\u201d is elitist, obscurantist and, in the case of jihadi outrages, a glorification of terrorism.</p> <p>The Hague trial honours the obligation of today\u2019s generation to guard the evidence of the past, at least in times of conflict. In admitting his guilt, al-Mahdi\u2019s lawyer says \u201che regrets all the acts he committed\u2026 and feels pain and a broken heart at what he has done\u201d. Would that all who perpetrate similar destruction, in war or peace, might say the same.</p> <p>Imprisoning al-Mahdi cannot do much good. Making amends by correcting his destruction is far better. If Timbuktu is any guide, the miseries lately inflicted on Iraq and Syria could yet be turned to recompense and renaissance. When peace returns, we cannot breathe life into dead bodies, but we can redress the murder of memories.</p>",

As Laing\u2019s advice stated, a parliamentary commission of inquiry would depend on the Coalition to fund it. Its powers could be contested in a court.</p> <p>The constitutional lawyer George Williams said a commission of inquiry was unlikely to pass the parliament without government support.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to see it would pass both houses, or be funded by the government,\u201d Williams said. </p> <p>\u201cThese issues as set out in the clerk\u2019s advice make it clear why this is unlikely to be viable. Any such inquiry needs government support.\u201d</p> <p>The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said although he understood the Greens were trying to get a compromise from Turnbull, Labor would persist with its calls for a royal commission because under pressure the prime minister would \u201cgive in\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat Australians want is not a system that goes after banks once they have ripped people off,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat Australians want is to stop the rip-off in the first place. </p> <p>\u201cLabor will persist with its calls for a banking royal commission and we think that is the right way to go.

It\u2019s a very, very hard thing.\u201d</p> <p>The remarks are the strongest evidence yet that Trump is softening his previous stance on illegal immigration, after a meeting with Latino Republicans over the weekend led multiple outlets to report that Trump had vowed to move beyond his pledge to deport all undocumented immigrants from the country, as well as US citizens born to undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>But the Trump campaign threw cold water on those reports at the time. Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Trump, said on Saturday: \u201cTrump said nothing today that he hasn\u2019t said many times before, including in his convention speech \u2013 enforce our immigration laws, uphold the constitution and be fair and humane while putting American workers first.\u201d</p> <p>Since fall of last year, Trump vowed to create a \u201cdeportation force\u201d to eject undocumented migrants from the US, but campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, a new addition to the campaign after a leadership shakeup earlier this month, waffled on whether the candidate still embraced that idea on Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cAs the weeks unfold, as the weeks unfold, he will lay out the specifics of that plan that he would implement as president of the United States,\u201d Conway told CNN. Asked about whether those specifics included a \u201cdeportation force,\u201d Conway replied: \u201cTo be determined.\u201d</p> <p>John Weaver, former senior strategist for the presidential campaign of Ohio governor John Kasich, told the Guardian\u2019s Ben Jacobs that Trump\u2019s newfound openness to legal status for undocumented immigrants reads highly familiar - despite Trump decrying the position as tantamount to amnesty during the Republican presidential primaries.</p> <p>\u201cHe has jack rabbit trailed his way to John Kasich\u2019s correct view on immigration,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cBut, alas it won\u2019t last.

Using his prepared remarks in the same way John Coltrane used the sheet music to My Favorite Things, the Republican nominee went on a number of memorable riffs. Voters learned that many of the Hollywood celebrities supporting Hillary Clinton \u201cweren\u2019t very hot any more,\u201d that Trump\u2019s much vaunted border wall would also have \u201cprotection for tunnels\u201d and that in a succinct summation of his message \u201ceverything is bad.\u201d</p> <p>With the hire of new campaign manager Kellyanne Conway last week, Trump had started to resemble a more traditional candidate. The teleprompters which he once disdained became a staple of rallies and the campaign\u2019s press office would send out prepared remarks for every speech. It was a far cry from the \u201clet Trump be Trump\u201d philosophy which guided the nominee\u2019s first campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and it was far more effective than efforts of replacement Paul Manafort to rein the outspoken real estate developer. Trump even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/donald-trump-tries-out-a-new-campaign-tactic-saying-sorry\">expressed a statement of regret</a> last week in North Carolina, the closest he has ever come to an apology for his multitude of controversial remarks in the course of his campaign.</p> <p>However, Trump\u2019s remarks Wednesday were classic unscripted statements from the candidate. He stoked controversy by hinting at unfounded rumors about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health when he apparently misspoke that his Democratic rival was \u201cpremedicated\u201d in lieu of saying \u201cpremeditated\u201d as was in his prepared remarks. Trump dwelled on the phrase and suggested that he liked \u201cpremedicated\u201d better. It was a return to form for the Republican nominee and one that was received to cheers from his supportive crowd. The question as Trump moves forward with yet another reinvented campaign team is whether this was a brief lapse in style or if it simply further evidence that no operative can tame the bombastic populist on the stump.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57be0c60e4b0fe30498a473f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-24T21:11:28.665Z\">10.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The director of Donald Trump\u2019s Maryland and Northern Virginia campaigns has suggested that Hillary Clinton is severely ill and would not survive a year in office during a \u201cMoms 4 Trump\u201d event in Loudoun County, Virginia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69aa6007102949ca4c53ad9e5a5fdfa8db53f0a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69aa6007102949ca4c53ad9e5a5fdfa8db53f0a1/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerald Herbert/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHow many of you would wear a wool coat in August?\u201d John Jaggers asked the a crowd of Trump supporters at Salamander Resort in Middleburg, Virginia, <a href=\"http://www.loudountimes.com/news/article/trump_campaign_operative_suggests_clinton_will_die_during_first432\">according to the Loudoun Times-Mirror</a>. \u201cThe woman who seeks to be the first female president of the United States wears a wool coat at every single thing.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/donald-trump-louisiana-floods-supplies\">visited Baton Rouge last Friday</a>, handing out water and diapers.</p> <p>\u201cFirst of all, one of the benefits of being five months short of leaving here is I don\u2019t worry too much about politics,\u201d said Obama, wearing a checked shirt with rolled-up sleeves and an unbuttoned collar, standing in front of piles of waterlogged debris. \u201cThe second thing I have seen historically is that, when disasters strike, that\u2019s probably one of the few times when Washington tends not to get political.</p> <p>\u201cI guarantee you nobody on this block, none of those first responders, nobody gives a hoot whether you\u2019re Democrat or Republican. What they care about is making sure they\u2019re getting the drywall out and the carpet out, there\u2019s not any mould building, they get some contractors in here and they start rebuilding as quick as possible. That\u2019s what they care about. That\u2019s what I care about.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/15/louisiana-flooding-disaster-obama-baton-rouge-mississippi\">The storm and its flooding</a> have damaged an estimated 60,000 homes and forced thousands to seek temporary housing. More than 115,000 people have registered for federal disaster aid. Obama said federal support is at $127m so far. At least 40 state highways remained closed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/23/barack-obama-fema-louisiana-flood-recovery-culture-katrina\">Obama praises Fema's 'change of culture' during tour of Louisiana flood recovery</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57be0242e4b048662988fcc8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-24T20:23:53.754Z\">9.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Video: </strong>At a private fundraiser on Sunday in Provincetown, Massachusetts, for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Cher praised Clinton while comparing Donald Trump to Stalin and Hitler.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/24/cher-trump-hitler-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5x6qd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2681977\"            data-video-name=\"Cher compares Donald Trump to Hitler at Clinton fundraiser \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57bdf9ebe4b0fe30498a4716\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/24/160824cher_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/24/160824cher.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/24/160824cher_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/24/cher-trump-hitler-video\">Cher compares Donald Trump to Hitler at Clinton fundraiser</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cDo you remember Fun With Dick and Jane?

Clinton\u2019s personal physician, <a href=\"https://m.hrc.onl/secretary/10-documents/01-health-financial-records/2015-07-28_Statement_of_Health_-_LBardack.pdf\">Dr Lisa Bardack, has repeatedly said</a>: \u201cSecretary Clinton is in excellent health and fit to serve as president of the United States.\u201d Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/clinton-responds-to-deranged-conspiracy-theories-about-her-health-746921539976\">conspiracy theories</a> about Clinton\u2019s supposed ill health have gone viral. There\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/18/12505078/hillary-clinton-health-stroke-conspiracy-fake\">no evidence</a> these claims are true.</p> <p>I\u2019m a doctor. I don\u2019t play at being a doctor. I don\u2019t diagnose patients in the absence of unbiased, reliable information, such as performing a physical exam or reviewing tests. When I write or am interviewed on television or the radio, I\u2019ll talk about what new research will mean for patients and the science behind the latest guidelines. I\u2019ll explain why we\u2019re seeing increasing rates of certain diseases and whether policies to combat them make sense. I don\u2019t talk about individuals except to say what one might expect more generally with regard to a particular medical illness.</p> <p>But the scientist in me understands that the real issue here isn\u2019t Clinton\u2019s health. Conspiracy theories signal fear; in this case, Trump\u2019s realization that Clinton may well be the next president of the United States.</p> <p>This is not the first time rumors of illness have been deployed to attack a seemingly untouchable political adversary. At a time when Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis had a 10-point lead over then vice-president George HW Bush in the polls, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2016/03/15/exp-rftwh-bush-vs-dukakis-1-1.cnn/video/playlists/race-to-the-white-house--original-series/\">reports circulated</a> that Dukakis suffered severe depression after losing his first re-election campaign. When asked if Dukakis should release his complete medical records, Ronald Reagan did little to dispel those rumors,<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/04/us/dukakis-releases-medical-details-to-stop-rumors-on-mental-health.html\">saying</a>: \u201cLook, I\u2019m not going to pick on an invalid.\u201d</p> <p>Some Trump surrogates are also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrMarcSiegel/status/764541927152820225\">calling</a> on Clinton to release her medical records. Trump has not released his, and a <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/images/uploads/trump_health_record.pdf\">letter from his physician</a> reads as if Trump had written it himself: little in the way of detail but plenty of superlatives like \u201castonishingly excellent\u201d and \u201cextraordinary\u201d. Meanwhile, in contrast to Clinton and every other presidential candidate in the last 40 years except Gerald R Ford, Trump has yet to release his tax returns.</p> <p>The scientist in me knows that attempts to debunk conspiracy theories \u2013 whether they\u2019re about Clinton\u2019s health or the myth that vaccines cause autism \u2013 are at best futile and may in fact <a href=\"http://www.uky.edu/AS/PoliSci/Peffley/pdf/nyhan-reifler%202007%20When%20Predictions%20Fail.pdf\">backfire</a>. We pick and choose those facts that add up to the truth we\u2019ve already chosen to believe. The more someone tries to disprove the reality we\u2019ve constructed, the more we dig in our heels.</p> <p>In 2008, questions about <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/robert-schlesinger/2010/03/24/party-of-nuts-poll-shows-gop-thinks-obama-is-muslim-socialist\">President Obama\u2019s citizenship</a> intensified with his likelihood of clinching the Democratic nomination. So long as the odds of winning the election remain in Clinton\u2019s favor, we can expect to see more conspiracy theories emerge between now and November.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/hillary-clinton-health-rumors-doctor-column\">I'm a doctor.

She told the Silicon Valley Business Journal, which first reported on the startup on Wednesday, that Legalist wasn\u2019t interested in the kind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/26/paypal-co-founder-peter-thiel-admits-bankrolling-hulk-hogan-gawker-lawsuit\">suit Thiel funded against Gawker through Hulk Hogan</a>. Shang said the startup focuses on small businesses tied up in costly litigation; the firm has accepted a single case so far.<br></p> <p>Shang told the Guardian the startup was funding \u201climited cases\u201d at the moment and stressed what she said were the business\u2019s philanthropic aims. \u201cI used to work for a public defender in DC,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not funding criminal cases, nor would I be funding any suits against the media.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLitigation financing as a field is growing so fast but the one area it\u2019s not actually getting to is small businesses.\u201d</p> <p>Shang said she didn\u2019t understand when she took the Thiel fellowship that it would come with so much negative attention. \u201cI accepted the Thiel fellowship because my parents are first-generation immigrants and when I was dropping out of Harvard, money was a concern,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Thiel famously pays undergraduates to drop out of college, and Shang is among <a href=\"http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2016/06/27/thiel-fellows-2016-harvard-and-mit-dropout-startups/\">this summer\u2019s crop of former students</a>.<br></p> <p>At the moment, Shang and Christian Haigh, the other founder, are the only people who decide what suits to take. Shang said she had considered forming an advisory board to mitigate ethical concerns. The press attention on the Thiel-backed startup, she said, \u201chas been stressful\u201d.<br></p> <p>Haigh said he could not answer questions until Friday.

Shang used the example of a bakery damaged by a burst pipe bogged down in costly litigation.</p> <p>But there is always the possibility that the ready availability of enough cash to pay for an aggressive suit will encourage litigation. Altman admitted the problem was complex: \u201cWith legal financing, this is one case where I can really empathize with both sides of the argument,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>There is also the practice of scouting for courts where local laws are particularly friendly to the kind of case a litigant wants to pursue.

  "<p>For the most part economic debate can revolve around the margins, with few bold ideas promulgated.

Enough to give you pause to consider that perhaps economic policies are not infallible.</p> <p>Senator Xenohophn\u2019s response this week has been to argue that the RBA should stop worrying about inflation, and instead should target stable nominal GDP.</p> <p>Now this is not a new idea. </p> <p>In the USA it has been doing the rounds since 2010 when economists such as Scott Sumner on his blog \u201c<a href=\"http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=31899\">The Money Illusion</a>\u201d began talking up the idea. In Australia John Quiggin was writing on the idea <a href=\"http://johnquiggin.com/2012/01/27/inflation-target-tyranny/\">in early 2012</a>, and in February 2012, then ALP backbencher Andrew Leigh asked then RBA Governor Glenn Stevens about it during a <a href=\"http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22committees%2Fcommrep%2Fe7dbd7b4-a20a-4de6-a315-f76b0e1fabd2%2F0001%22\">House Economics committee hearing</a>. </p> <p>We normally talk about \u201creal\u201d GDP when we talk about GDP growth \u2013 as that is the measure of the real change in economic output. Nominal GDP is just real GDP plus inflation. </p> <p>Those in favour of the idea argue that stable nominal GDP growth is a better measure of economic health than is stable inflation.</p> <p>Generally the target thrown about is 5%-6% annual growth \u2013 because that is roughly the sum of average inflation growth of 2.5% plus average output growth of 3%.</p> <p>But the big difference is when targeting nominal GDP growth you don\u2019t care how you get there. If output growth is 1% and inflation is 5% then in effect that is no better or worse than if output is growing by 5% and inflation 1%, as both would see nominal GDP growing by 6%.</p> <p>The reason nominal GDP targeting is favoured now is that our current nominal GDP growth is historically weak:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Australia's annual GDP growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SFWMu/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Not only is it at levels you would normally associate with a recession, we are also in the very bizarre situation where real GDP growth is higher than the nominal growth rate \u2013 which means that the inflation measure used for GDP figures is negative \u2013 ie prices are falling.</p> <p>This goes to both the reason for nominal GDP targeting and the problem with it.</p> <p>The nominal GDP measure can get pretty erratic in Australia because it is influenced greatly by wild changes in our terms of trade. </p> <p>This is because, unlike the CPI, the GDP deflator (which is the inflation measures used in the GDP figures) includes changes in the prices of our exports as well as many non-consumer items.
