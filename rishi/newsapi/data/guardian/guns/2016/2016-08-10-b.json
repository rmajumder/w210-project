  "<p>The first two answers are \u201cshort people lifting enormous weights over their heads\u201d and \u201cKitty Chiller\u201d. The questions that prompt them are \u201cWhat do you want to see more of in Seven\u2019s Australian Olympic coverage?\u201d and, well, \u201cWhat do you want to see <em>less</em> of in Seven\u2019s Australian Olympic coverage?\u201d In those respects at least, the host network has so far triumphed.</p> <p>But first to matters of practicality and scorn. Unlike the London Games four years ago, this time Australians are not able to indulge in the multi-channel splendour of Foxtel\u2019s supplementary coverage, with rights holders Seven maintaining exclusivity to spread the action (at least in theory) over three digital channels of their own. In what must have seemed a straightforward exercise at planning stage, they augmented the old-fashioned TV coverage with a loudly-trumpeted, once-off-payment <a href=\"https://mumbrella.com.au/seven-blames-rio-olympic-app-failure-386350\">$20 streaming app that has promptly cacked itself</a> for most of the first week of competition, leaving significant numbers of Australians stranded without coverage.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/10/australias-emma-mckeon-claims-bronze-as-alicia-coutts-signs-off-olympic-career\">Australia's Emma McKeon claims bronze as Alicia Coutts signs off Olympic career</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The people, unsurprisingly, are not happy, and have descended on the reviews sections of the GooglePlay and iTunes stores with the type of icy vengeance normally seen from Russian judges in the gymnastics arena. If they could have seen or heard it, neither would they have been impressed by the apology offered early in the piece by Seven host Jim Wilson, who prefaced the network\u2019s mea culpa with a head-wobbling boast about their booming TV viewership figures \u2013 like a fish \u2018n chip shop proprietor regaling you with an account of his daily takings instead handing over the dinner you just paid for.</p> <p>Instead, huge swathes of the population have swapped glorious Olympic action for the sight of their own crumpled, rage-filled faces reflecting back at them from blank iPad screens. At that angle, not even Gisele B\u00fcndchen can avoid self-loathing. In lieu of a solution, by Tuesday Seven\u2019s Basil Zempilas doubled down on the bragging and claimed the digital venture had been \u201cdownloaded in record numbers,\u201d which was both ill-advised and about as plausible as the IOC-generated myth that three billion people watch the opening ceremony.</p> <p>On that topic, there was something drily amusing about<strong> </strong>Fernando Meirelles producing the kind of prolonged, advertiser-spooking global warming rant against which commercial networks would normally recoil. The less said about Zempilas, Bruce McAvaney and Johanna Griggs\u2019 recitation of the Brazilian tourist board script the better. Might they have gently queried the host nation\u2019s occasionally selective interpretation of history, from which the Wright brothers, for one, were entirely wiped?</p> <p>The other sin for which Seven has so far copped a not-unjustified pasting is in continuing to provide their standard overgenerous helpings of breakfast show Sunrise. It grinds on uninterrupted even as live sport takes place elsewhere in Rio. But far more fuss should be made of the ludicrous situation on weekdays between 5pm and 7pm, when Seven\u2019s three channels are quite astonishingly an Olympics-free zone, what with all those episodes of American Pickers, Pawn Stars and 60 Minute Makeover to broadcast. Such disdain for viewers is puzzling given the vast amounts of lucre involved in securing Olympic rights in the first place. There is no Olympic flag where TV executives live. They\u2019re lodged in a different planetary realm.</p> <p>All these logistical farces are a bit of a shame. When it\u2019s actually been available for viewing, the content itself hasn\u2019t been too bad, if hampered by the usual giant splashes of jingoistic swill (can we rule out unhinged patriotism in the mysterious case of the diving pool turning green?). The pillar of the operation is In Rio Today, the network\u2019s two-hour nightly studio highlights recap. In that, Hamish McLachlan is doing his usual snappy job wandering around a circular podium as a dizzying series of graphics swirl around him. The only shame is that these visual aids often contain dot points of the lines he\u2019s about to read out on cue, rather than something useful like a medal tally or a schedule of upcoming events. It also makes McLachlan look like he\u2019s performing the world\u2019s least essential TED Talk. As with hosts using touch screens, this is another in the long line of needless scourges we must tolerate in modern sports broadcasting. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e5ecb203533b3cad2cb0e2f65714fb9edae3031\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e5ecb203533b3cad2cb0e2f65714fb9edae3031/0_78_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rugby sevens players\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australia\u2019s women\u2019s Rugby Sevens gold medalists have emerged as stars of Seven\u2019s television coverage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Seven\u2019s other hosts are a mixed bag, though as long as the big events are actually being shown live we could probably put up with Warwick Capper and an animatronic kangaroo back in the studio. You don\u2019t have to have been an athlete to describe them, of course, but it seems to have helped<strong> </strong>Jim Wilson\u2019s<strong> </strong>career that he at least <em>sounds</em> like one, and an Oss-straylee-unn at that. \u201cWe can catch our breath now,\u201d Wilson said at one point as he read out a series of tweets sent on behalf of Michael Phelps\u2019 infant child. It must be exhausting. Much more broadcasterly, ironically, is the work of former jocks Griggs<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>Todd Woodbridge,<strong> </strong>while other hosts such Kylie Gillies and Mel McLaughlin have been solid contributors too . </p> <p>That\u2019s mostly left Mr Olympics Bruce McAvaney to cool his jets until the athletics events commence, perhaps a good thing while he\u2019s comparing Phelps to Sir Donald Bradman. The sight of McAvaney wearing a gaudy polo shirt was also slightly disconcerting. Wasn\u2019t he born in a network blazer and tie?</p> <p>As for the actual commentary, unfairly maligned Zempilas and his analyst Giaan Rooney<strong> </strong>have been, periodic abandonment of impartiality aside, a decent combo in the swimming. Zempilas has mostly resisted the verbose Norman Mayisms of some predecessors and Rooney sounds a hell of a lot happier talking about swimmers lapping up and down a pool very quickly than in other TV roles she\u2019s filled. Funny that. The only time Zempilas truly grates is when he overreaches in search of gravitas. \u201cThere\u2019s the record book, then there\u2019s the Michael Phelps book!\u201d he bellowed as the American won the 200m butterfly gold. Not one we\u2019d read, Baz.</p> <p>Undoubtedly helped by the compelling performance of the Australian women\u2019s team, Mark Braybrook has been a clear and concise caller of the Rugby Sevens, a compelling spectacle that has revealed itself as ripe for further televisual exploitation, especially with characters as genuinely appealing as Sharni Williams, Charlotte Caslick and Ellia Green. Australia claimed medals in trap shooting and archery too but for all the combined skill and vague sense of danger in those events, in TV terms you suspect they\u2019d be out-rated by surveillance footage from a golf driving range.</p> <p>Of the other expert callers, Debbie Watson has been our favourite for explaining the myriad tactical permutations of water polo, which, with no disrespect intended to our glorious Olympians, otherwise appears an entirely lawless game of poison ball played by swimming team delinquents. Over at the equestrian, Martin Gostelow was to our inexpert ears absolutely perfect for his role, in that he sounds like a man who also plays royal tennis and applies his shaving cream with a badger-hair brush.</p> <p>The support cast have been energetic enough too. Given the plum job of sideline interviewer at the pool, perma-ecstatic Nathan Templeton peaked early in the role of official specs-holder for golden boy Mack Horton, but crashed back to earth on day two when he misread Emma McKeon\u2019s failure to win a medal in the 100m butterfly final as a moment of mild jubilation and not, as was actually the case, a personal nightmare of tearful proportions. As the awkwardness dawned upon Templeton and he deftly retreated, you wanted to hug both of them. Fortunately they were reunited in happier circumstances when McKeon claimed bronze on Wednesday. It\u2019s a long haul, the swimming.</p> <p>The other podium effort so far has come from Seven\u2019s roving news reporter Chris Reason, who doggedly pursued Chinese hero Sun Yang in the wake of his headline-grabbing imbroglio with Horton. Reason\u2019s sustained prodding was rewarded when the swim star eventually stopped in his tracks and snapped: \u201cI don\u2019t know, what is Horton?\u201d There are many ways to avenge a loss but denying your opponent\u2019s very existence is certainly a novel gambit.</p> <p>When assessing their various disasters so far, maybe Seven management can look to the Aussies in action for inspiration. Speaking of one mishap by the women\u2019s synchronised diving pair, who couldn\u2019t always nail the seemingly fundamental requirement of landing in the water at the same time, analyst Loudy Wiggins cheerfully suggested: \u201cthe judges won\u2019t see that.\u201d They <em>did</em>, of course, but the Aussies still took out bronze regardless. For now the broadcasters themselves remain out of medal contention, but not without hope.</p>",

But it bemoaned the lack of data on Muslims, which it said must be addressed to help devise the government\u2019s response to the inequalities. </p> <p>Other recommended policies include possible legislation to introduce name-blind recruitment by employers, local budgets for Jobcentre Plus offices to fund targeted support in areas with high levels of Muslim unemployment and a dedicated careers service for minority ethnic students in universities.<br></p> <p>The committee says there is a particularly pressing need to help women, who, it says, face the triple issue of being female, BME (black and minority ethnic) and Muslim and face the most barriers, when job-hunting and once in work. </p> <p>Millar said she was personally shocked by the inequalities they face. \u201cIt was made very clear to us that Muslim women face very real stereotypes to counter \u2013 both in the workplace and in their community \u2013 with respect to work.\u201d </p> <p>The inquiry heard evidence that traditional family pressures holding that women are homemakers and the lack of women in governance roles at mosques are among the obstacles preventing Muslim women fulfilling their potential. To counter these, the committee suggests mosques should promote opportunities for women and the government should introduce a role models and mentoring programme aimed at Muslim women. </p> <p>It says employers should be made aware of their legal duties with respect to discrimination, especially with respect to women who may wear cultural or religious clothing.</p> <p>The MPs want the government to come up with a plan by the end of the year to tackle the inequalities it has highlighted.<br></p> <p>Farah Elahi, research and policy analyst at a race equality thinktank, <a href=\"http://www.runnymedetrust.org/\">the Runnymede Trust</a>, welcomed the report and said it was time for government action. \u201cThe government should be concerned about these issues because they are legitimate [in their own right], not just through the prism of counter-terrorism.\u201d</p> <p>A government spokeswoman said: \u201cWe want all people, regardless of their faith or gender to have access to the same opportunities so that they can reach their full potential. We are making progress \u2013 for example, there are now 45% more Muslim women in work than in 2011 \u2013 but we know there is much more to do.

On a gloomy, sullen day in Rio\u2019s military suburbs the Olympic dressage pranced into gear with little in the way of fanfare, something short of a stampede in the stands but with at least one irresistible sporting story lurking at its heart.</p> <p>Charlotte Dujardin, dressage\u2019s superstar, did not get to ride on day one. Great Britain\u2019s gold medal champ will instead go on Thursday, having been placed 52nd on the starting roster and therefore given a pass on Rio\u2019s first real dog of a day, the rain clinging at the edges all afternoon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/aug/10/rio-2016-olympics-day-five-phelps-froome-gymnastics-swimming-live\">Rio Olympics: GB win gold in canoe slalom and synchronised diving \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the optimistically generous stands a gaggle of equine ultras huddled in plastic smocks and double jumpers as the riders came and went through an unforgiving day. Spencer Wilton of Great Britain put in a a crisp assertive round early on. Later S\u00f6nke Rothenberger of Germany drew huge cheers for his routine on Cosmo and topped the leaderboard at the end. Late in the day Britain\u2019s Fiona Bigwood trotted out to the strains of A Day in the Life by the Beatles and took second spot with a lovely round on the beautiful Orthilia to a rousing cheer from the scattered crowd. Right at the last Dorothee Schneider produced a high-class 80.98 to leapfrog both.</p> <p>For now, though, it is all pretty much a prelude to Dujardin. For those who follow this sport only as a four-yearly intrusion among the easy spectaculars of track and pool Dujardin will simply be a name, a medal, another beaming gold in the fug of London 2012. She is, though, a genuine sporting phenomenon.</p> <p>Dujardin first appeared on the scene in 2011, aged 26, propelled from the fringes into the most inaccessible reaches of equine sport by a pure, unignorable talent. Since when she has \u2013 these things are relative \u2013 been a whirl of punkish modernism, with her sensational adoption of the crash helmet over the stove-pipe affairs still worn by most competitors in Rio, and the willingness to apply a genuine elite athlete\u2019s competitive edge against the entitled bufton-tuftons of the old Euro horse set.</p> <p>Above all she is transformatively good. Not only is Dujardin the Olympic champion, world champion and runaway world-record holder. She is, frankly, a horse-dancing, game-changer: she is the West Indies pace attack, Total Football, the Fosbury flop. Not only are her scores prodigiously good; she has a restless creative drive, seeking an obscure kind of figurative equine perfection. This is by all close accounts a compulsion for Dujardin, chasing the perfect ride, the moment where nothing in that conjoined series of movements can be improved or altered or cast any other way.</p> <p>At which point it is necessary to address the real reason Dujardin\u2019s excellence is so unremarked. Dressage for the people is a journey that has some way to go. All governing bodies like to talk about \u201cgrowing the sport\u201d. Not much of this is heard from dressage. And with good reason when it is all too easy to see only its otherness and elitism, its frosty ancestral embroidery, to be jeered at and junked as a relic of old feudal Europe.</p> <p>The Portuguese for dressage is \u201chipismo\u201d. But there really is nothing hip about dressage. In Rio the equestrianism authorities have set up a kind of visitors\u2019 centre in the main Olympic park, an all-comers\u2019 lure to give a first taste to curious passers-by which will no doubt have the favela children prancing about the streets on their \u00a360,000 show horses dreaming they, too, can one day join the minuscule European elite that has the time and money to entwine its life around this sport.</p> <p>Everybody gets this. It is remote, inaccessible and, of course, a little silly. What kind of sport simply cannot take place without a cod-disco Donna Summer medley, without fussicky blow-dried floral pots, without its athletes wearing a cravat?</p> <p>Against this the other option is simply to enjoy its grand baroque fascination, to lose oneself in its fine, vellum-lined protocols. Watch on TV and you see a person in a top hat propelled around a large, prissily tended sandpit. Get close in the flesh and you really see only the horse, if only because these are frankly wondrous animals, vast, thrilling beasts that do not jump as much as float, all high-spec engineering and silky, undulating muscle.</p> <p>At its best there is a kind of reflex quality to dressage, the horse transformed into a heaving marionette at the heels and fingers of its rider. Dressage involves making the horse stand still, control its limbs, move to your movements, essentially stopping it being a horse, all the while retaining symmetry and balance and the opaque rigmarole demanded by a seven-person judging team.</p> <p>Fittingly for Deodoro Park, essentially a huge out-of-town barracks, dressage has its routes in soldierly horsemanship, a world where complete control of one\u2019s horse was a matter of professional excellence, of not being killed, not breaking the line.</p> <p>Dujardin herself is now a part of this story. Dressage has been in the doldrums at times, a sport pushed to the edge of things by its own arcane stylings, its remoteness. At times it could have fallen away completely or been marginalised into a kind of polo set oddity. It found a new chapter with the individual freestyle, a more expressive, interpretive event that projected the riders more as performers, creative artists in the gymnastics tradition. And now it has its own star, a rider who first sat on a grand prix dressage horse aged 14, who is not from the dressage set but from a middle-class family in Enfield with a mother who happened to be obsessed with showjumpng.</p> <p>London 2012 changed her life utterly, a moment of startlingly public home Olympic exposure for an athlete who has always ridden simply because her talent demanded it. \u201cI had so much media and I\u2019ve never ever been in that situation. It scared me to death,\u201d she said this week .</p> <p>Carl Hester, who also rides here, first spotted her in a junior competition. Since then he has been her role model, stable-master, benefactor, friend and now a part of her story, swept along by a brilliantly successful partnership. It was at Hester\u2019s stables, where Dujardin mucked in and mucked out as a teenager, that a third party entered the story.</p> <p>Valegro was a broody, difficult horse with whom Dujardin found an instant chemistry. Their relationship is now arguably one of the great love stories of these Olympics, pegged out in the last five years around a series of impossible highs. Next up is Rio and the Deodoro ring on Thursday, followed by the individual medals on Monday, and another moment of projection beyond that cloistered world for Britain\u2019s own queen of the refined, impossibly mannered world of piaffe and trot and pirouette.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/10/rio-2016-olympic-equestrian-dressage-all-you-need-to-know-video-explainer\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4qa33\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2644896\"            data-video-name=\"Rio 2016 Olympic equestrian dressage: all you need to know \u2013 video explainer\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ab0488e4b0139724dfa1c0\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/10/160810EquestrianDressageExplained_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/10/160810EquestrianDressageExplained.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/10/160810EquestrianDressageExplained_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/10/rio-2016-olympic-equestrian-dressage-all-you-need-to-know-video-explainer\">Rio 2016 Olympic equestrian dressage: all you need to know</a></figcaption> </figure>",

  "<p>Labour\u2019s civil war entered a bitter new phase with Jeremy Corbyn and his deputy Tom Watson locked in a public spat about whether the party risks being taken over by hard left activists driven out in the 1980s.</p> <p>Watson sent the leader\u2019s office a four-page document, based on publicly available information, detailing what he said was evidence that Trotskyists had been attending meetings of grassroots pro-Corbyn Momentum pressure group and seeking to influence the Labour leadership election.</p> <p>He claimed some of the individuals involved were members of other parties, including the Socialist party, the successor to Militant, whose members were expelled from the Labour party by Neil Kinnock.<br></p> <p>The evidence included <a href=\"http://www.socialistparty.org.uk/articles/23274/26-07-2016/no-compromise-with-labour-right-wing\">reports from the Socialist party\u2019s website</a> of its members addressing Momentum rallies and tweets from an activist expelled from Labour earlier this year who appeared to be running phone banks backing Corbyn in the leadership race.</p> <p>Watson\u2019s letter was a riposte to the accusation made on Tuesday<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/09/trotskyists-young-labour-members-jeremy-corbyn-tom-watson\"> by Corbyn\u2019s campaign that he was \u201cpeddling conspiracy theories\u201d</a> after he said in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/09/tom-watson-interview-jeremy-corbyn-labour-rifts-hug-shout\">Guardian interview</a> that Labour was at risk from \u201cTrotskyist entryists\u201d.</p> <p>Watson wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s not a conspiracy theory to say that members of these organisations are joining Labour.

He added: \u201cThe lava of this revolution is still hot.\u201d </p> <p>The Socialist party <a href=\"http://www.socialistparty.org.uk/articles/23328\">published an editorial</a> on Tuesday which argued for a Labour split, even if it meant the party was left with just 20 MPs. \u201cThe civil war, now it is out in the open, cannot be simply called off,\u201d the editorial said.</p> <p>Taaffe said: \u201c[Watson] is referring to entryists, but we were not entryists, we were born in the Labour party, and we were expelled because we fought Thatcher in Liverpool and defeated her.\u201d He insisted that Labour MPs critical of Corbyn could not \u201cstop the winds of history as they\u2019re developing at the moment\u201d.</p> <p>Smith\u2019s campaign received a fillip on Wednesday when he was endorsed by the GMB union after he won a ballot of its members, 60% to 40%. Its general secretary, Tim Roache, said: \u201cGMB members cannot afford for Labour to be talking to itself in a bubble for the next five years while the Tories run riot through our rights at work, our public services and our communities.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s allies blame the result on \u201cGMB political officers close to Watson\u201d and claimed the ballot question \u201cWho do you think is best placed to lead the Labour party to a general election victory and serve as prime minister?\u201d was a leading one, because it made reference to electability.</p> <p>Former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie ridiculed that claim: \u201cIf you don\u2019t think you can be considered as a potential future prime minister, then what sort of leadership are you talking about? This boils it right down to whether we just want to be some sort of protest movement.\u201d</p> <p>Smith and Corbyn will face each other in their second live hustings in Gateshead on Thursday night, but Labour is still involved in a legal wrangle over the rules of the contest, with the national executive committee\u2019s appeal against a high court judgment forcing it to give the vote to 130,000 recent members due to be heard.</p> <p>Some Labour activists regarded the victory of six pro-Corbyn candidates in the NEC elections announced earlier this week as a signal that he would win re-election by a wide margin. </p> <p>Meanwhile Saving Labour, the group that has been encouraging sceptics of Corbyn to get involved in the leadership contest, say they have convinced 50,000 trade union members, targeted through social media and in addition to 70,000 people who paid the \u00a325, to sign up as registered supporters in order to vote.</p> <p>\u201cThis contest is far from over. Our success in this campaign shows that a huge number of trade union members want to see new leadership, and will vote accordingly when ballot papers drop in a couple of weeks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/06/brexit-companion/embed/embed.html?id=what_was_militant\" data-alt=\"Corbyn atom\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/06/brexit-companion/embed/embed.html?id=what_was_militant\">Corbyn atom</a> </figure>  <p>Members of rival political parties that stand candidates against Labour are not allowed to join, but some MPs complain that veterans of its bitter internecine struggles in the 1980s, some of them allied to banned groups, are involved in the current battles.</p> <p>In his letter to Corbyn, Watson said: \u201cI assume that you still support the proscription of other political parties. If the position had changed, please just let me know because I think it would be useful to discuss this within the party.</p> <p>\u201cI am asking you to confirm that you believe members of the Socialist party and the Alliance for Workers\u2019 Liberty should not be allowed to be members of the Labour party, given the proscription of these two groups [then called Militant and Socialist Organiser] by annual conference during Neil Kinnock\u2019s leadership.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for Corbyn responded to Watson\u2019s claims: \u201cIt\u2019s absolute fantasy and, if this is the way they want to characterise new Labour party members, then it\u2019s not going to do them any favours in the leadership contest.\u201d</p> <p>He added that the party\u2019s policy on refusing to allow members of other parties to join Labour had not changed.</p> <p>However, sources close to Corbyn said there would be nothing to stop Socialist party members renouncing their membership and joining Labour, comparing the situation to defections from the Greens or Conservatives. They also argued that the party\u2019s compliance unit, which vets applications for membership, is, if anything, too quick to exclude leftwingers on political grounds.</p> <p>Watson said he had been \u201creliably informed\u201d that some members of Momentum were consciously adopting the tactics used by Militant in the 1980s, including tips for infiltrating local constituency Labour parties published in Michael Crick\u2019s history of the movement.</p> <p>The advice, which Watson reproduced in full in his letter to Corbyn, includes suggestions such as: \u201cMake the event adversarial. Uncomradely questions to sitting councillors and the MP, challenging the chair\u2019s method and motive, defining the politics of the speaker before they have defined their own. This behaviour basically reduces the attendance of the remaining sensible types. Then the meeting [is] ours to control.\u201d</p> <p>A Momentum spokesperson insisted they did not recognise the quotes, saying: \u201cThe description quoted from Michael Crick\u2019s book runs entirely contrary to Momentum\u2019s ethos and ways of organising.

The early groups of asylum seekers who arrived on Nauru came under Australia\u2019s previous Labor government. Although the government\u2019s policy had hardened against the prospects of resettlement in Australia, many still hoped they could find a way there.<br></p> <p>These hopes began to dim. The children, particularly, began to try to fit into life on Nauru. Teachers were brought to the island, mostly from Australia, and a school was set up within the detention centre to give them lessons.</p> <p>\u201cThey were welcoming, they were keen to learn and also they were very tolerant of each other,\u201d Davies said.<br></p> <p>At the primary school, Rose said, she usually had 95% attendance. \u201cThey want to learn, they\u2019re very passionate about education.\u201d<br></p> <p>They would draw in classes, play football. But the days were monotonous. Processing their asylum claims was slow, and the Australian government\u2019s increasingly tough policy began to weigh heavily on the asylum seekers.<br></p> <p>Living there was difficult, particularly for the children. Entire families would live in a single canvas tent. For teenages, the lack of privacy made it hard for them to develop naturally. \u201cThey were under surveillance constantly,\u201d Reen said.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was so upset at that moment, and I was nervous so I drunk cleaning liquid</p> <footer> <cite>Five-year-old boy</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat feeling that the children had that they were criminals, because they were escorted everywhere \u2026 they were wanded in, wanded out; their bags were checked,\u201d she said, referring to the guards\u2019 use of metal detectors.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere are no private moments in the camp, so that\u2019s really difficult for teenagers. They\u2019re at a stage of development where they need to express themselves, and grow into their personality.\u201d<br></p> <p>And as the length of their detention increased, so too did rates of self-harm and other of other serious incidents. The Nauru files show a steady increase in the number of critical incidents as time in detention increased.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also about exposure,\u201d Reen said. \u201cEven the children who weren\u2019t directly affected by assaults themselves they were constantly exposed to incidents and to adults who were experiencing psychiatric disorders as a result of their prolonged incarceration.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cAnd the children always knew that \u2013 and they were just living on a knife\u2019s edge all the time.\u201d<br></p> <h2>School shut down</h2> <p>Weeks after the Australian immigration department announced it was shutting down the school, officials interrupted one class so they could measure it for use as an office.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1012f08d0539d29d7c7b5cd79b7a497a6f78fec9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1012f08d0539d29d7c7b5cd79b7a497a6f78fec9/0_362_1075_1153/932.jpg\" alt=\"An asylum seeker holds a letter asking for the school to remain open\" width=\"932\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An asylum seeker holds a letter asking for the school to remain open</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The teachers all pointed to the closure of the Australian-run school as one of the lowest points for children at the detention centre. The immigration department made the decision <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/mar/31/asylum-seeker-children-start-campaign-to-save-their-nauru-school-from-closure\">to shut the school</a> in March 2015. From September, the children would be funnelled into Nauruan schools. All asylum seekers aged between seven and 17 were to attend local schools, while children under seven would stay at the detention centre.<br></p> <p>School was more than a place of learning for the asylum seekers on the island, the teachers said. It was also a place they could be safe in what was becoming a more volatile environment. The Nauru files show that the pace and frequency of serious incidents at the detention centre steadily increased between 2013 and 2015.</p> <p>Children would sometimes just curl up in a beanbag in a corner, Davies said. \u201cThey were safe there without any possibility of being hurt,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe one last thing left in their life was the school. And they knew it was good so what did they do? They decided to take it away from them.\u201d<br></p> <p>The teachers were shocked that the school was closed, and also by what was planned for the site. Recreation rooms, coffee machines and new offices for Australian immigration department staff replaced the rooms filled with children\u2019s drawings.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt was absolutely criminal what they did to those kids,\u201d Davies said.<br></p> <p>Rose said the department went about the closure with little planning or consultation. \u201cHad we know that was going to happen we could have prepared those children a lot better,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just meant there was another shock in their lives. It was really difficult for them.\u201d<br></p> <p>The Nauruan schools were poorer quality. Education standards are low on the island. Facilities are in a dire state. And, in some schools, corporal punishment is still practised. Some of the Nauru files detail allegations of corporal punishment by Nauruan teachers.<br></p> <p>Some of the children <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jun/30/nauru-plan-to-move-asylum-seeker-children-to-local-schools-sparks-concern\">were so distressed</a> they began writing letters to the immigration department expressing thoughts of self-harm.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2016/08/nu-files/embed/embed.html#incident=sca150463\" data-alt=\"Incident report of protest at school\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2016/08/nu-files/embed/embed.html#incident=sca150463\">Incident report of protest at school</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe all boys from secondary class made in the school \u2026 we [planned] that we are all going to protest without eating,\u201d a five-year-old boy said in a handwritten note.

It sounds great when a presidential candidate promises to simplify the tax code, cutting the number of tax brackets from seven to three and reducing the tax owed by those in the top tier to 33% from 39.6%.</p> <p>It\u2019s a plan that enables Trump to claim that everyone will be paying less, since individuals earning less than $25,000, and couples making less than $50,000, wouldn\u2019t owe any federal tax.

Silva was a victim of racist taunts from her countrymen in 2012, when she was disqualified in the London Games.</p> <p>The Brazilian public can be cruel when disappointed by their sporting heroes, whether male or female. Some of the most stinging taunts of this Olympics have been reserved for the men\u2019s football team, which drew two of its first three matches 0-0 and is struggling to progress, while the women\u2019s team has qualified for the next round with ease.<br></p> <p>Neymar \u2013 the \u00a350m Barcelona forward \u2013 has been the focus of discontent and unflattering contrasts with his female counterpart Marta. Perhaps the most shared picture of the Games so far is that of a small boy who crossed out the name Neymar on his Brazil football shirt and replaced it with Marta.</p> <p>Maynara Fanucci, a feminist campaigner, says the Neymar-Marta debate partly reinforces traditional values because it teases the man for being weaker than a woman and has so far done nothing to change the huge imbalance in funding or TV coverage for the two teams.</p> <p>But she says the positive headlines for female athletes are a positive sign, as are the campaigns to counter sexist coverage.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt makes me happy that we are finally talking about this, because it has often slipped by for a lot of people because it was presented as natural,\u201d Fanucci said.</p> <p>\u201cIn general, I think that today people are seeing the sexism in society more clearly, and also speaking about it more. We point the finger, and the internet helps a lot in spreading ideas and raising awareness. Perhaps, you see a meme on your feed and think: that\u2019s true, the women\u2019s team are playing a lot better.

  "<p>When Donald Trump pitched an economic policy platform nakedly contrived to benefit other multi-millionaires to an assembled crowd in Detroit this Monday, it was quite a spectacle. If there was ever any doubt about the absurdity of the signifier of populism in American politics, it should have been dashed there and then.<br></p> <p>What\u2019s clear by now is that Donald Trump\u2019s populist appeal is limited to a very specific populace, by design. The question of whether Trump\u2019s support is predicated on race versus class isn\u2019t really a question anymore. It\u2019s the kind of thing that can be tested with polls and multivariate regression models. Which is exactly what political scientist <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/6/2/11833548/donald-trump-support-race-religion-economy\">Philip Klinkner</a> did, and found that, controlling for one another, pessimism about the economy doesn\u2019t predict support for Trump; resentment toward African Americans and Muslims does. </p> <p>It\u2019s the reason why Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/07/19/this-one-survey-shows-why-trump-wont-win-over-sanders-supporters/\">won\u2019t win over Sanders supporters</a>: however much he invokes Nafta and the decline of manufacturing in the Midwest, as he did in his Detroit speech, trade just isn\u2019t as politically salient as he thinks. Most voters don\u2019t rank trade as a top issue. And most of Trump\u2019s supporters care far more about immigration and terrorism, which makes his frequent racist and Islamophobic dog whistles far more effective at shoring up his base.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-money-blog/2016/aug/10/donald-trump-economic-policy-wealthy-tax-breaks\">How Trump's 'populist' economic policy hides a payday for the wealthy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are, of course, many on the left who wish trade was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/07/donald-trump-why-americans-support\">more of a salient issue</a>, just as many wish the US had stronger unions and an honest-to-God populist party. But given our history as a country founded on white supremacy, the dream of a kind of pure populism, unadulterated by racism and xenophobia, has always been elusive. Trump\u2019s platform and rhetoric neatly dovetail with those of earlier American populist parties, the Know Nothings (for whom their alien scourge was Catholics) and the People\u2019s Party (who called for restricting immigration in their founding document).</p> <p>Which is why it doesn\u2019t really matter that Trump gets so much wrong on economics. Just in this one speech, he asserted, without evidence, that the Department of Labor is misreporting unemployment figures, apparently confusing their U3 and U6 rates. He conflated retirees with people out of work. He used out-of-date census data to say that household income dropped $4,000 in 16 years, which is not true. He claimed a Congressional Budget Office report says \u201cObamacare will cost the economy two million full-time jobs,\u201d when the report says no such thing. He flat out made things up about Clinton\u2019s tax plan. He called for repealing an estate tax that affects only him and a handful of his richest peers, a display of self interest that\u2019s so unabashed it\u2019s impressive. Make me president and I\u2019ll end the tax on private jets and orange hair weaves. </p> <p>He can get all this wrong and it won\u2019t matter. Just as it doesn\u2019t matter that a man who appears to use bankruptcy as a business model can claim to be a jobs candidate. Just as it didn\u2019t matter that the last movement to be called populist, the Tea Party, had average incomes <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/us/politics/15poll.html?_r=0\">well above the US median</a>. It\u2019s not about jobs and it\u2019s not about income. Even if it should be. <br></p> <p>To be sure, the Democrats\u2019 allergy to anything resembling class-based politics does much to enable Trump, and the continuation of a racialized populism largely divorced from economics. When Democrats say \u201cmiddle class\u201d, they mean \u201cworking class\u201d, and when Republicans say \u201cworking class\u201d, they mean \u201cwhite people\u201d. To be called working class in America means being an evangelical, being a gun owner, living in a rural area, not being black or Latino or Asian \u2013 being, in other words, a typical Republican.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>So when Democrats flip flop on trade, and cozy up to Wall Street while keeping unions at arms length, who can blame Republicans for seizing an opportunity to fill the void? And the more Trump\u2019s racialized populism alienates establishment Republicans, the more Clinton embraces them, trumpeting an elite Washington consensus that she is the only responsible candidate in the race. Which may be true. </p> <p>But if there\u2019s anything that feeds the Trump phenomenon more than racial resentment, it\u2019s suspicion of an elite Washington consensus. When class disappears, being declared wrong by the whole of the establishment is enough to qualify you as a populist.<br></p>",
  "<p>Theresa May has called on Argentina to discuss running more flights to the Falkland Islands and lifting its restrictions on oil exploration in the area.</p> <p>It is the prime minister\u2019s first public communication with Argentina over the contested South Atlantic islands, which are governed by Britain, since she moved in to Downing Street last month.<br></p> <p>The letter she wrote to Argentina\u2019s president, Mauricio Macri, was published by local media, but was not reported by Downing Street. Since taking office in December, Macri has sought to strengthen his country\u2019s ties with Britain and end the confrontational approach of the previous administration.<br></p> <p>In a letter largely welcomed in Argentina, May wrote: \u201cIt is my sincere hope that, where we have differences, these can be acknowledged in an atmosphere of mutual respect and with the intention to act in a way that benefits all those concerned.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis includes making progress towards new air links between the Falkland Islands and third countries in the region and the removal of restrictive hydrocarbons measures.\u201d<br></p> <p>Argentina\u2019s foreign minister, Susana Malcorra, said later that London and Buenos Aires had been discussing the issue of flights for three months. \u201cThis conversation started during my visit to London in May when I met with my then counterpart Philip Hammond,\u201d Malcorra said. \u201cWe began talking about the possibility of reestablishing flights. We\u2019ve been exploring and looking at ways to do this but it hasn\u2019t been resolved yet.\u201d</p> <p>Malcorra said the possibility of a meeting between May and Macri at the G20 summit in China next month was under discussion. \u201cWe think it is a good opportunity for a first conversation,\u201d the minister said.</p> <p>She added that the issue of hydrocarbons was also under discussion. \u201cThe United Kingdom has expressed interest in looking at the hydrocarbons law, we have our legal departments working on it, so I\u2019d say that work is in progress.\u201d</p> <p>The Chilean company Latam currently operates a flight from Santiago to the Falklands every Saturday via Punta Arenas in southern Chile. Once a month, the same flight also stops in Rio Gallegos in Argentina. <br></p> <p>Under the previous 12 years of leftwing government, Argentina restricted hydrocarbon exploration in the area around the Falklands. The UK has continually asked for the restrictions to be lifted. To do so may be difficult, because Macri is in a coalition and might not get the support of parliament.<br></p> <p>Macri met David Cameron at Davos earlier this year, and the two men agreed not to allow the Falklands dispute to damage wider relations between London and Buenos Aires.<br></p> <p>May\u2019s letter appears in part to have been a response to lobbying by the Argentinian government to win UK support for its candidate to replace Ban Ki-moon as UN secretary general.<br></p> <p>Argentina is promoting Malcorra for the post. Britain is not expected to reveal how it voted, but it us likely to support Malcorra. Some, however, say it would be difficult to give her such a sensitive diplomatic role, given that the Falklands dispute means her neutrality would be questioned.</p> <p>May is likely to meet Macri at the G20 summit in China in September, when they are likely to discuss their mutual determination to fight international corruption. During a visit to Brussels in July, Macri said that \u201cour claim will never change\u201d, but hoped for dialogue with Britain.</p>",
  "<p>The activities of the Bank of England in the City\u2019s gilts\u2019 market tend to be for the initiated only.

On Tuesday, the Bank could not find enough financial institutions willing to part with their gilts. It was the first time this had happened, calling into question the viability of the whole quantitative easing (QE) programme.</p> <p>There was never any doubt that the Bank would succeed in finding willing sellers in its operations on Wednesday when it was buying bonds with a seven- to 15-year maturity. The problem the previous day was at the long end of the market, affecting gilts with a maturity of 15 years or more.</p> <p>The big test will come next Tuesday when the Bank again seeks to buy these long-dated gilts. Broader misgivings about the QE programme have not been quelled.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Critics point to two issues. First, long-dated bonds are valuable to pension funds. They are thinking decades ahead and need long-term assets to match long-term liabilities. Their reluctance to sell long-dated bonds explains Tuesday\u2019s embarrassment.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street was always going to have less trouble buying short-dated bonds and there is an argument for concentrating its efforts in this sector of the market anyway. That is because a whole range of financial products, including mortgages and bank loans, are set using short-dated gilts as the benchmark. Buying this category of bonds will drive down interest rates and stimulate activity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/06/brexit-companion/embed/embed.html?id=what_are_gilts\" data-alt=\"What are gilts?\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/06/brexit-companion/embed/embed.html?id=what_are_gilts\">What are gilts?</a> </figure>  <p>That is the theory. Low bond yields mean borrowing for companies is ultra-cheap. But there has been no investment bonanza. Firms have been borrowing, but only in order to finance share buy-back schemes. </p> <p>That raises a second issue. Are the intricacies of the gilts\u2019 market indicative of a bigger problem: namely that monetary policy (interest rates and QE) is no longer working?</p> <p>John Maynard Keynes famously said there were times when trying to stimulate growth through monetary policy was like pushing on a piece of string and it was then up to the Treasury to boost demand through public investment or tax cuts. The UK \u2013 along with Japan and the eurozone \u2013 appears to have reached that point. </p>",

  "<p>Donald Trump does have an economic policy, it seems. But if you\u2019re trying to find any hint of ideological coherence in the odd mish-mash of positions that the GOP presidential candidate laid out in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">nearly hour-long speech in Detroit on Monday</a>, your quest will be in vain.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s speech was meant to put his campaign back on track and it did \u2013 briefly, before he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\">derailed it again</a> with his suggestion that gun-supporters might take aim at Hillary Clinton, so to speak. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">Trump's economic plan: no 'death tax', less business tax, and fewer regulations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To many voters, he is stronger on the economy than rival Hillary Clinton, who will speak on the issue Thursday. But while the speech clarified some details of his plans, it also showcased their many faults and their favoring, for this supposedly populist candidate, of the 1%.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s stated objectives range from the outright protectionist (tear up the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal) to the business friendly goals of putting a moratorium on new regulations and introducing an energy policy that pays no heed to concerns about climate change or global warming.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Then there are the measures that are downright tricky to evaluate on the surface. It sounds great when a presidential candidate promises to simplify the tax code, cutting the number of tax brackets from seven to three and reducing the tax owed by those in the top tier to 33% from 39.6%. </p> <p>It\u2019s a plan that enables Trump to claim that everyone will be paying less, since individuals earning less than $25,000, and couples making less than $50,000, wouldn\u2019t owe any federal tax. The problem, of course, is that while all the attention is focused on the absolute rates, less is devoted to unravelling the complicated question of just how the taxes would be levied. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s new plan includes a <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/09/tax-loophole-in-trumps-plan-would-create-windfall-for-the-rich.html\">big windfall for his fellow billionaires</a>, in the form of the rate at which \u201cpass through\u201d income will be taxed. This income \u2013 which earns its moniker by flowing through a separate business, partnership or limited liability company before reaching an individual \u2013 is now taxed at the individual rate. Trump proposes to tax it at a new, much lower rate of 15%, giving the wealthy individuals who establish these structures a big, big payday.</p> <p>While camouflaging that payday for the wealthy, Trump trumpeted his populist credentials with two other parts of his economic game plan. The problem? Neither offer the benefits to ordinary Americans of the kind that the candidate suggests they might.</p> <p>Let\u2019s consider the (in)famous \u201cdeath tax\u201d.</p> <p>If you listened to Trump\u2019s speech, you might imagine that this is something that the typical American family is up in arms about \u2013 that we stay up at night worrying about the IRS showing up to take away Grandma\u2019s collection of silver and china or Grandpa\u2019s woodworking equipment to satisfy the \u201cdeath tax\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNo family will have to pay the death tax,\u201d Trump proclaimed. \u201cAmerican workers have paid taxes their whole lives. It\u2019s just plain wrong and most people agree with that. We will repeal it.\u201d</p> <p> Well, families like Donald Trump\u2019s may have worried about, and paid, estate taxes. But the rest of us? Not so much, unless, that is, our parents and grandparents bequeath us an estate worth north of $5.4m. That\u2019s the current threshold at which the IRS starts to get a share of the proceeds \u2013 so Grandma\u2019s silver is safe. You can probably sell some of her stocks and bonds to satisfy the taxman before you have to worry about family heirlooms.</p> <p> The estate tax, which affects about 2% of Americans, or about one in every 700 deaths annually, does generate about $25bn a year in revenue for the country\u2019s coffers. I\u2019d argue that there\u2019s a case to be made for waiving or cutting it when a small business owner\u2019s death might force his heirs to close or sell that business: that surely isn\u2019t the intent of the tax. </p> <p>On the other hand, repealing it so that wealthy families can simply pass on all their wealth to their heirs, while governments struggle to deliver basic services to families who themselves are struggling in a country where the wealth gap has become a wealth gulf? That idea becomes even more unpalatable when promoted by a billionaire-turned-politician who, <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/trump-lays-out-tax-plan-that-would-benefit-his-family-w433267\">along with his family, so clearly will benefit personally</a> from the policies he\u2019s promoting. </p> <p>It becomes even more odd when you consider the fact that many of the country\u2019s wealthiest families are now so rich that they are signing on to <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/06/01/giving-pledge-new-members-2016/\">the Giving Pledge.</a> Joining an effort launched by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, its signatories promise to give away at least half of their net worth to philanthropic causes. Obviously, they\u2019d prefer to choose where their money goes rather than have Uncle Sam decide it belongs to the US treasury, but the fact remains that the country\u2019s wealthiest citizens \u2013 those most likely to be hit by the \u201cdeath tax\u201d \u2013 are spending down their billions already rather than fretting about turning their heirs into next-gen billionaires. The rhetoric about the \u201cdeath tax\u201d is squarely aimed at those middle-class Americans who feel financially squeezed and over-taxed and oppressed by government red-tape of all kinds, but who never will have to pay a dime in \u201cdeath taxes\u201d in their lives.</p> <p>I\u2019ll give Trump the benefit of assuming that his goal in proposing a childcare initiative was benign; it at least means that he finally is acknowledging that it\u2019s a topic that he needs to take seriously. In the run-up to his Monday speech, the rumor was that he was about to suggest a \u201cnew way\u201d for families to deduct childcare costs from their taxes.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the \u201cnew way\u201d wasn\u2019t really that new after all. Trump simply proposed that households be able to \u201cfully deduct\u201d their childcare expenses against their taxes. That\u2019s revolutionary rhetoric for a Republican candidate, admittedly, but it ignores the fact that about 45% of Americans don\u2019t pay federal income taxes, and so wouldn\u2019t benefit from that deduction. </p> <p>For them \u2013 and for that matter, for all working parents \u2013 the key issue is affordability. For a low-income family, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/04/08/rising-cost-of-child-care-may-help-explain-increase-in-stay-at-home-moms/\">childcare costs can chew up 40% of household income</a>, according to a Pew Research Center report. That means many women are kept out of the workforce altogether by a lack of affordable, accessible childcare options.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s focus on the narrowest part of the childcare conundrum, and the most self-evident solution (the one that benefits the middle class and more affluent families who have already found and can pay for childcare) shows just how oblivious he remains to the real problems that beset his constituency, and how tissue-thin his populism is. It\u2019s a solution that he thinks should fit the problem, rather than one that addresses the real issues.</p> <p>For the GOP candidate to Make America Great Again for those on the wrong side of the wealth gap, he\u2019s going to have to try a lot harder than this.</p>",

The law states that those who die in the service of their country are exempt from death duties. The duke went on to live another 23 years, eventually dying of cancer at the age of 60. </p> <p>The estate passed to his brother, Robert Grosvenor, who successfully argued that the wound had caused infections which eventually led to cancer. By 1970 Robert was the richest man in Britain.</p> <p>The 6th duke\u2019s children will owe their fortune to rules that give generous concessions to the trusts used by Britain\u2019s wealthiest families. With death duties at 40%, the heirs could have been liable for a \u00a33bn plus tax bill but the taxman is not expecting a huge windfall.</p> <p>The late duke once said of his fortune: \u201cGiven the choice, I would rather not have been born wealthy but I never think of giving it up. I can\u2019t sell. It doesn\u2019t belong to me.\u201d</p> <p>In the eyes of the law, this is correct. His assets were owned by a series of trusts, which come under the umbrella of the Grosvenor estate. The estate\u2019s trustees control the property business, via Grosvenor Group Limited; Wheatsheaf, a food and energy business, which runs the farms; a fine art collection and a series of cash investments; rural land holdings in Lancashire, Sutherland and Wales; and the family seat at Eaton Hall near Chester.</p> <p>\u201cThe benefits of trusts are that they don\u2019t form part of somebody\u2019s estate,\u201d explains Ian Dyall, a manager at Towry, a tax planning adviser. \u201cIn a discretionary trust you have a whole pick list of potential beneficiaries which the trustees can choose to appoint benefits to, but no individual beneficiaries can demand money. Money can stay in the trust and cascade down generation to generation for up to 120 years and nobody pays inheritance tax on it.\u201d</p> <p>Trusts are liable to one form of inheritance tax: every 10 years, HM Revenue and Customs is entitled to claim 6% of the value of the trust fund. However, the Grosvenor estate could benefit from several exemptions. For instance there are waivers for food-producing farms and for trading businesses that employ real people. Grosvenor and the rural estates employ about 1,000 staff \u2013 and the numbers are prominently advertised on their websites.</p>",

Truly the trial of the century, it was about a murder, yes, but his acquittal was about the long history of race relations in America, the country\u2019s obsession with celebrity, the police mistreatment the black community, and any other number of issues. What made The People v OJ Simpson so excellent is that it plumbed those depths and confronted us not with the trial itself, but with the harsh truths about the problems that simmer just under the lid of our society. </p> <p> The Menendez brothers and the JonBenet case were never that meaningful. They were sensational tabloid fodder that shows the worst in our country when it exploits the pain of others and the deaths of people we find culturally significant. The Ramsey case is long cold, and maybe we should leave it at that, and the Menendez brothers are still rotting in jail and don\u2019t need any sort of reprieve or re-examination. </p> <p>But whenever TV finds a good idea it needs to remake it continuously before the formula stops being successful.

The one-nation pitch even had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/02/ed-miliband-one-nation-speech\">echoes of former Labour leader Ed Miliband</a>.</p> <p>There certainly is room for improvement. A report by the Department for Education this month revealed that the number of working-class students attending universities and colleges <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/03/tuition-fees-state-school-university-education-jo-johnson\">dropped in 2013-14</a>, the first year affected by the rise in tuition fees to \u00a39,000. On Sunday, it was reported that May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/07/senior-tories-likely-to-resist-theresa-mays-grammar-schools-agenda\">might lift the ban on new grammar schools</a>, to boost social mobility and opportunity.</p> <p>So, is there any substance to this \u201cnew meritocracy\u201d? And what is a true meritocracy? And, perhaps most importantly, is it desirable in the first place?</p> <p>A meritocracy sounds positively utopian. After all, what could be fairer than a society in which status is defined by achievement rather than hand-me-downs? But the reality is more complex.</p> <p>James Bloodworth, author of The Myth of Meritocracy, was a working-class boy, comprehensively educated, who messed up his A-levels. It was only when his grandmother managed to find \u00a31,000 to enable him to retake them that things fell into place. Today, he is a respected journalist. On the surface, he looks like a poster boy for meritocracy.</p> <p>Not quite, he says. He was lucky. Without the \u00a31,000 from his grandmother, his life would have taken a different turn. And that, he says, is what started him thinking about meritocracy. Yes, it is about the choices an individual makes. But those choices don\u2019t occur in a vacuum \u2013 they are enabled, usually by money or contacts.</p> <p>Over the past half century, the ideal embraced by all British governments has been a meritocracy achieved by equality of opportunity. But, for Bloodworth, this is a sham. \u201cYou have to have cognitive dissonance to talk about a meritocracy while doing nothing about the gaps between the rich and poor, or while not closing down the private school system. Unless you\u2019re talking about that, you\u2019re not really serious about meritocracy or equality of opportunity.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"879371af520368b469581b3e2abb015b4803a63a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/879371af520368b469581b3e2abb015b4803a63a/0_0_594_402/500.jpg\" alt=\"Children in an east London slum in 1954\" width=\"500\" height=\"338\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children in an east London slum in 1954.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kurt Hutton/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government<strong> </strong>was reluctant, or unwilling, to close the gap between rich and poor.

And Labour did reduce pensioner and child poverty, but it did not make society more egalitarian. A <a href=\"http://www.ifs.org.uk/bns/bn89.pdf\">2010 Institute of Fiscal Studies report </a>said the gap between rich and poor had grown since 1997, despite attempts by three successive governments to reduce income inequality by reforming the tax and benefit system.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.suttontrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Leading-People_Feb16.pdf\">report from the social mobility charity the Sutton Trust</a> earlier this year revealed that 42% of Britain\u2019s Bafta-winning actors had been privately educated and a further 35% attended grammar schools. While it is true that the likes of Eton (alumni include Eddie Redmayne, Tom Hiddleston, Damian Lewis and Dominic West) have top facilities for aspiring thesps, that is far from the full story.</p> <p>Michaela Coel hoots with laughter when I ask if we live in a meritocracy.

Class. She and her sister were brought up by a mother who worked as a cleaner. \u201cI was the only one in the entire year whose parents did not own a home. What were her fellow students like? \u201cThey pronounce all their consonants and vowels with a lot of enthusiasm. I don\u2019t want to say posh \u2026 but it is a kind of privilege.\u201d</p> <p>Has she joined this elite? Again, she laughs. No, she says, and she wouldn\u2019t want to. \u201cYou don\u2019t transcend your background. I am very careful about who I choose to work with \u2026 now the Bame [black, Asian and minority ethnic] thing is in, you\u2019ve got people that actually have a lot of prejudice towards working-class people and people of colour but work with them because they\u2019re ticking boxes and filling quotas. I\u2019m always reminded that this is not my world, but I\u2019ve been invited into it. I\u2019ll give you an example. Say you go to an awards ceremony where everybody receives a gift bag with makeup.

I could because I got a full grant.\u201d She said the impact was already being felt in the arts. \u201cWorking-class kids aren\u2019t represented. Working-class life is not referred to.\u201d Elbow frontman Guy Garvey says: \u201cFor a decade, living off the dole enabled us to learn our craft. Even if you do find the time to do it, you don\u2019t have the impetus at the end of a working day to create. There\u2019s absolutely no way in today\u2019s climate that we would have become a successful band.\u201d Sport might appear to be meritocratic, but often isn\u2019t \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/13/olympics-2012-gb-medallists-private-schooling\">more than a third of Team GB\u2019s 2012 medal-winners were privately educated</a>.</p> <p>The postwar era is widely regarded as Britain\u2019s golden age of social mobility. There were a number of reasons why so many working-class children found themselves joining the professions \u2013 grammar schools, new white-collar jobs in the health and education services, and the need to replace all those who had been killed in the second world war.</p> <h2>Eleven-plus was unfair</h2> <p>Film-maker Ken Loach grew up in Nuneaton. His father was a machine tool worker who became a foreman. Loach was one of the few working-class kids who went to the local grammar, and one of the tiny number who ended up at Oxford. But he regards this \u201cgolden age\u201d as a chimera. \u201cThere is a fundamental flaw in the premise, and that is a progressive society would not seek to have a large group of unfulfilled people from whom a few could escape; you would seek to have a society where everybody was able to fulfil some part of their potential. The Tory idea is that you keep the majority down and let a few rise; a socialist idea should be that the whole population rises.\u201d</p> <p>Loach returns to Rab Butler\u2019s education act of 1944, which introduced the 11-plus. Many regarded it as a triumph of progressive reform; Loach says it entrenched unfairness. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic piece of class legislation because the idea was that a few were selected from the working class to go on to be middle management or enter the professions, and those who failed the 11-plus were then earmarked for labour. So they have always picked what they saw as the most able of the working class to support their system.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb8d5e97d86a2713cac3b36e2c0e3863832436a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb8d5e97d86a2713cac3b36e2c0e3863832436a2/0_0_594_502/500.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester grammar school pupils in a physics lesson, 1950\" width=\"500\" height=\"423\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester grammar school pupils in a physics lesson, <br>1950.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Surely he benefited from his grammar school education? \u201cWell, if you won the prize, of course you benefited enormously. But it was at the expense of those whose education was going to finish before there was any possibility of higher education.\u201d</p> <p>In the 1960s, Loach was one a number of working-class film-makers who joined the BBC. Was there a sense of breaking through the glass ceiling? He explodes with quiet fury at the notion. \u201cThe breaking-through idea is fallacious \u2026 we don\u2019t want to break through into their world, we want to make a different world. It\u2019s really important to make that point. The idea of breaking through and leaving everybody else behind is a deeply divisive concept, isn\u2019t it? So we\u2019ve got to reject that notion altogether and say the intention is not to leave behind the kids who are going to be doing the most unrewarding jobs.\u201d Anyway, he says, he was still a pawn of capitalism \u2013 there was suddenly a market for working-class voices, and that\u2019s why he was allowed to make his films.\u201d</p> <p>We hear so much about upward social mobility, but what about downward social mobility? Surely if society is to be fairer, then those who start with huge advantages should be brought down a peg or two. How easy is that to achieve? Simple, Loach says. \u201cAbolish private schools and integrate all schools into one system. Integrate all healthcare into one system and pay for it all out of a general taxation. That would have a massive effect immediately.\u201d He pauses. \u201cBarry Hines [the author of the book that was turned into the 1969 film Kes], who died recently, had a good phrase. He said all the kids should walk through the same gate. I think that\u2019s a good way of putting it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a85371f4cfc0d2dab88877059902dbd1168f13c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a85371f4cfc0d2dab88877059902dbd1168f13c/0_0_4096_2731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Thatcher, left, after she handed over the deeds to a family who were the GLC\u2019s 12,000th council house buyer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Thatcher, left, after she handed over the deeds to a family who were the GLC\u2019s 12,000th council house buyer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA/PA Archive/Press Association Ima</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/17/lynsey-hanley-how-i-became-middle-class-respectable-experience-of-class-extract\">Respectable: The Experience of Class</a>, Lynsey Hanley explored her journey from a working-class childhood to becoming part of a middle-class \u201cemerging elite\u201d. She says she \u201cbristles\u201d when people say social mobility is dead \u2013 she\u2019s a living example that it isn\u2019t. But, equally, she bristles when people say we live in a meritocracy \u201cbecause it is quite clear that we don\u2019t\u201d.</p> <p>Hanley isn\u2019t surprised by May\u2019s promises. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic Tory trope to say we\u2019re the real party of working people. About a third of all Tory party voters have historically been C2/D/E classes, and since the time of Harold Macmillan they have very cleverly said Labour\u2019s job is to keep you down and our job is to encourage you to do whatever you want to do. They have a sort of evil genius for saying that, if you want to be oppressed, vote Labour, but if you want to achieve your dreams, vote Tory.\u201d</p> <p>Does she buy into it? \u201cNot in the sense that I would ever vote Tory. But I can see why it is successful.\u201d She talks about how the council house right-to-buy scheme was originally a Labour idea, but they weren\u2019t brave enough to go through with it. \u201cThe Tories took it up and working-class people did think: \u2018Oh my God, we\u2019ve been given this hand up.\u2019\u201d The long-term consequence has been the depletion of council housing stock and a new homelessness problem. In 1998 (the first year for which figures are available), there were <a href=\"file:///Volumes/Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/SN02007.pdf\">1,850 rough sleepers</a>; by 2015, there were 3,569.

Posh kids, clever kids, went to grammar school. I was destined to be a grammar school boy. But at the age of nine I became ill with encephalitis, spent the next three years away from conventional school, and missed out on the 11-plus. I divide my life into two distinct stages \u2013 pre-enceph, and post-enceph. Partly because the illness changed my brain so radically, and partly because it changed me politically. I didn\u2019t have the language for it, but subconsciously I began to realise that words such as meritocracy were just words. I started to hate the things that my previous self had stood for.</p> <p>But the kid I remembered was clever and elitist. I had attended a junior school where most people came from similar backgrounds \u2013 upper working class, lower middle class; workers and shop owners, with a few accountants thrown in for good measure. I was deemed one of the smartest. As such, I was taken away from the less smart \u2013 given extra tuition, nurtured, encouraged to like classical music and go to the Halle. I had little to do with the less able. It wasn\u2019t a conscious decision, it was just the way things worked. The pupils deemed to be without merit were left to sink into secondary moderns while the smarties sailed off to Manchester grammar school or its equivalent.</p> <p>I was a meritocrat. I had risen under my own steam. Only I hadn\u2019t. I had been born lucky, with brains and parents who encouraged me to work (Dad had left school at 14, but became a fairly successful businessman until Margaret Thatcher saw him off, and was proudly middle-class; Mum taught children with special needs).</p> <p>But I didn\u2019t sail off to grammar school. I stayed in bed and, by the time I was ready to return to school, the local authority said I would not catch up, so sent me to an open-air school, alongside kids with chronic asthma, Down\u2019s syndrome and toughies on probation. Nobody did exams at the open-air school. Whereas they had given me extra tutition at the junior school, here we spent the morning taking the piss and the afternoon playing outside on the football pitch. Where did the kids at the open-air school \u2013 many as bright as the ones at my primary school \u2013 fit into the meritocracy?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07ef4c1aff340deb0d288bc35aa0316151bd907e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07ef4c1aff340deb0d288bc35aa0316151bd907e/0_326_4896_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Blair, whose government brought in tuition fees in 1998\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Blair, whose government brought in tuition fees in 1998.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Forsyth/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mum was so proud when I got to university. She told me I had achieved it all off my own bat. But I hadn\u2019t. She had fought for me when the local authority wouldn\u2019t let me go back to a regular comprehensive (I did a year later), encouraged me to work and paid for a tutor. She fought again when I messed up my A-levels and pleaded with Leeds University to let me in, promising that it was a blip. Meritocrat? I was no meritocrat. But I didn\u2019t even know what it meant by now. Some of the kids from the open-air school could have been there with me at university, but they were consigned to the scrapheap.</p> <p>Back in 1979, <a href=\"http://www.suttontrust.com/newsarchive/half-of-new-cabinet-was-privately-educated/\">91% of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s cabinet</a> were privately educated, even though she was not. David Cameron\u2019s 2015 cabinet was 50% privately educated. So <a href=\"http://www.suttontrust.com/newsarchive/sutton-trust-analysis-shows-big-rise-in-state-educated-ministers/\">May\u2019s 30% privately educated cabinet</a> is impressive (and better, slightly, than both Blair and Brown\u2019s governments), but we shouldn\u2019t get carried away. While it is encouraging that 44% of cabinet ministers went to non-selective state schools, it still leaves 56% who went to private or grammar schools.</p> <p>I email and tweet a number of the state-educated Tories to see what they think about meritocracy. Surely Nick Timothy will have plenty to say about how he was saved by grammar school. He tweets back, directing me to a press officer. I tweet Patrick McLoughlin, but get no reply. Greg Clark, son and grandson of milkmen, doesn\u2019t reply either. Perhaps I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. They are acting like true meritocrats; having risen to the top of society, they are fully occupied, and have little time for the rest of us.</p> <p>Eventually, the slightly less socially mobile secretary of state for international trade, Greg Hands, returns my call. After passing his 11-plus, he went to Dr Challoner\u2019s in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, one of the most successful grammar schools in the country. Does he believe the Tories are the true party of social mobility? \u201cYes, because we are the only party to have had a woman prime minister \u2013 now two. We are the only party that has had a Jewish prime minister, we are the first party to have a female Muslim cabinet minister. Labour is so much more about where you come from. We focus on where you\u2019re going to and where the real talent lies. And if you believe that people are equally talented across sex, races and backgrounds, people will invariably come through in the Conservatives. We are the only real meritocratic party.\u201d</p> <h2>Anything but utopian</h2> <p>It was the Labour politician and sociologist Michael Young who popularised the term meritocrat in his <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=e_rTyIMJR9kC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">1958 satirical essay The Rise of the Meritocracy</a>. His vision was anything but utopian. While Young despised inherited privilege, his meritocrats were a far scarier, more selfish elite. Because they believed they had achieved everything by merit, they had no time for those without merit \u2013 society\u2019s losers. They had no sympathy, no patrician benevolence, and didn\u2019t even believe they should subsidise them by paying tax.</p> <p>Bloodworth says it is a misapprehension that meritocracy is an ideal of the left. \u201cIt is a liberal Conservative concept. It is anti-aristocracy, but it is still antithetical to the egalitarian impulse of the Labour movement.\u201d</p> <p>Toby Young, son of Young, agrees. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unusual for incoming Conservative prime ministers to talk about meritocracy. John Major did it, David Cameron did it. Expressing commitment to meritocracy has been a characteristic of all political leaders since 1979. One of the things my father was dismayed about is that a word he coined to describe a phenomenon he considered ghastly has become used to describe something that all parties claim as their lodestar.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e35170f2bf1d7b0083de7e547b588ee7d45c106e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e35170f2bf1d7b0083de7e547b588ee7d45c106e/0_281_3369_2021/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ken Loach: \u2018The idea of breaking through and leaving everyone else behind is divisive.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ken Loach: \u2018The idea of breaking through and leaving everyone else behind is divisive.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alastair Grant/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Young paints a vivid picture of the dystopia his father envisaged. \u201cIn a wholly meritocratic society, where status is entirely dictated by a combination of IQ and effort, the people who aren\u2019t successful don\u2019t have an excuse for being unsuccessful, and since the vast majority of people will be unsuccessful in a meritocratic society, the vast majority of people will be unhappy and feel worthless. Also, the only way to make a truly meritocratic society work would be to separate children from their parents at birth because of the impact parental socio-economic status has. Philosophically, the main shortcoming of meritocracy is that a society in which your status is determined by your natural talents is no fairer, given that natural abilities are distributed at birth in a way which is random from a moral point of view, than a society in which your status is determined by inherited wealth, which is equally random from a moral point of view.\u201d</p> <p>Despite all this, Toby Young is an avowed meritocrat. Why? \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any chance the meritocratic society my father envisaged will ever emerge. And as a counter to nepotism, it can play a very useful role.\u201d The day we talk, Owen Smith, candidate for the Labour leadership, gives a speech in which he talks about <a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2016/07/the-kind-of-revolution-ill-deliver-owen-smiths-speech-on-industry/\">equality of outcome</a> rather than equality of opportunity. It is this vision that terrifies Young every bit as much as meritocracy did his father. \u201cThe problem with equality of outcome is that it involves too great an encroachment on human rights in order to bring it about. In every society in which there have been state-led efforts to bring about equality of outcome, there has been the abandonment of free speech, the imprisonment of dissidents and sometimes state-sanctioned torture and mass executions. In order to bring about equality of outcome, you need to set yourself at odds with human nature.\u201d</p> <h2>Stealing ideas</h2> <p>After May\u2019s speech, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ed_miliband/status/753340639073472512\">Ed Miliband tweeted her</a>: \u201cCongratulations on becoming PM. Good words in Downing Street. Time will tell. I have unused material \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Does he think she is stealing his ideas? \u201cWell, it did sound a lot like our language,\u201d he says. \u201cThe fact that she\u2019s saying it tells you about the zeitgeist. The mood at the moment is that you can\u2019t operate in mainstream politics without understanding that inequality and predatory capitalism is a problem that needs to be tackled. I think that\u2019s reflected in the government\u2019s coverage of Philip Green at BHS and Mike Ashley at Sports Direct. Whether it turns out to be genuine, let\u2019s wait and see. I have my doubts.\u201d Miliband says it is now Labour\u2019s job to challenge May. \u201cLabour needs to set her tests to see how serious she is. Whether it\u2019s on wages or housing or investment or taxes or the roles of the trade unions.\u201d</p> <p>Does he consider himself a meritocrat? \u201cI\u2019ve always thought meritocracy is necessary but not sufficient. The flaw in meritocracy is that it is equal opportunity to be unequal. Clearly, it\u2019s better if there are equal opportunities to get on. Meritocracy and social mobility have their place, but I also care about the outcomes. How unequal are the outcomes? I think it\u2019s got to be \u2018meritocracy-plus\u2019. I don\u2019t think meritocracy on its own is sufficient for a good society.\u201d</p> <p>Although the number of working-class students going to university rose under New Labour, social mobility actually decreased between 1997 and 2010. Five years before Blair came to power, polytechnics had morphed into universities. But the change was more semantic than real. Employers could still distinguish between degrees from traditional universities and born-again former polys. The old hierarchies were still in place. It simply resulted in academic inflation \u2013 a new currency came into being and the market readjusted itself to its old ways. So employers demanded masters and PhDs rather than just a common or garden degree. And whereas the privileged few who went to university in the old days did so for free, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/jan/27/tuitionfees.students\">1998 Blair introduced tuition fees</a> for the many who now went. The result? Working-class people had to incur tens of thousands of pounds of debt to qualify for jobs that previously didn\u2019t need a degree. Blair\u2019s experiment might have been well intentioned, but ultimately it helped increase the gap between rich and poor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d5d5082c43e485b3cd037cc07fdf2a878f854f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d5d5082c43e485b3cd037cc07fdf2a878f854f2/0_577_3678_2207/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ed Miliband: \u2018Inequality and predatory capitalism is a problem that needs to be tackled'\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ed Miliband: \u2018Inequality and predatory capitalism is a problem that needs to be tackled.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1994, <a href=\"http://www.hefce.ac.uk/media/hefce/content/pubs/2010/201003/10_03.pdf\">13% of children</a> from the poorest areas went to university, compared with 50% in the richest areas \u2013 a gap of 37 percentage points. By 2004 this gap expanded to a record 40 percentage points as 15% of the poorest students and 55% of those from the wealthiest families went into higher education. By 2009, the gap was down to 38 percentage points, still larger than before Blair\u2019s university expansion started.</p> <p>Lee Elliot Major of <a href=\"http://www.suttontrust.com/\">the Sutton Trust</a>, talks of an academic arms race. \u201cEvery time opportunities widen for those from less privileged backgrounds, the middle classes find some way of defining merit to their advantage again. Never underestimate the skills and the tenacity of the middle classes to reinforce their privileged position in society. So there was a university expansion, but if you look at the more prestigious universities, there\u2019s still a stark gap in terms of those from more advantaged backgrounds versus those from disadavantaged backgrounds. And increasingly you\u2019re seeing post-graduate degrees.\u201d</p> <p>It is 11 years since the <a href=\"http://www.suttontrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/04/IntergenerationalMobility.pdf\">Sutton Trust published its headline-making report about social mobility</a>. \u201cIt shocked the Blair government, showing that not only had social mobility declined over recent generations, but that we have lower social mobility than most other developed countries,\u201d Elliot Major says. \u201cTwo factors outlined in that original research were educational inequality and income inequality; what happens inside the school gates and what happens outside them. And those two things interact and reinforce each other despite all the educational reforms. The challenge we face is deeply profound.\u201d</p> <p>The Sutton Trust has discovered that one statistic remains virtually unchanged in its 19-year existence \u2013 roughly half the elites among the professions were privately educated \u2013 and this despite the fact that only 7% of pupils attend private schools. \u201cThat means we are missing out on a lot of talent from the 93% that are still at state schools,\u201d Elliot Major says.</p> <p>When I speak to him he is spending the week at Cambridge University with more than 500 state-school students. \u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is: You don\u2019t have to go to Cambridge, but give it a chance, because all our research suggests that, even with A grades, a lot of children have the attitude, it\u2019s not for the likes of me.\u201d</p> <h2>The gap is wider now</h2> <p>Today, my children\u2019s generation are, by and large, better educated, poorer and less job-secure than my generation. We hear about their latest startups, their brilliant multitasking, the fact that they don\u2019t want to waste their life working in one boring field like their parents. And, yes, there might be some truth there, but it also reeks of desperation; of making the best of a world without jobs; where everybody, bar the elite of the elite who are wealthier than ever, belongs to the precariat.</p> <p>And all the time the gap between the haves and have-nots widens. <a href=\"https://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/\">The Equality Trust</a> calculates that the <a href=\"http://inequalitybriefing.org/graphics/inequality_briefing_30.pdf\">richest 100 people in Britain</a> now have as much wealth as the poorest 30% of households. Meanwhile, the top-to-bottom ratio in the FTSE 100 companies is around 300:1 \u2013 the chief executive is likely to get paid 300 times more than the lowest paid. Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, authors of The Spirit Level, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/09/society-unequal-the-spirit-level\">wrote in the Guardian</a>: \u201cIt is hard to think of a more powerful way of telling people at the bottom that they are almost worthless than to pay them a third of 1% of what the CEO in the same company gets.\u201d</p> <p>Four weeks is a long time in politics. May\u2019s speech on social mobility is a distant memory, and already she seems to be backtracking. On 1 August, the Conservatives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/01/maintenance-grants-scrapped-for-poorest-students\">scrapped maintenance grants for the poorest students</a>.

But the vast majority of us also believe that right is strengthened through smart laws that protect us and our families. We want comprehensive and universal background checks. We want required training. We want common sense laws to keep us all safe.</p> <p>When I was in the US navy, I served for a time as the work center supervisor and leading petty officer for two divisions of weapons systems maintainers and operators aboard the USS Thach. The requirements for our military members to use firearms include, but are not limited to: annual live-fire training, regular background checks and a \u201csanity check\u201d each time they check out weapons and ammunition from the armory.<br></p> <p>We do these things because they work.

But what she, and Barack Obama, have proposed doesn\u2019t even strengthen our laws to mirror the rigors of the military. In fact, all they\u2019ve asked for is a universal background check system for anyone purchasing a gun \u2013 something that as many as 83% of gun owners also support.</p> <p>Meanwhile, it\u2019s hard to think of any national security or firearms professionals who think that what Trump said is acceptable. Hell, I don\u2019t know many humans who think what he said is acceptable \u2013 aside from a few folks who are trying to change what Trump said or make excuses for him. </p> <p>House speaker Paul Ryan called his remarks \u201ca joke gone bad.\u201d And Trump\u2019s running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, said he was simply referring to \u201ctremendously unified\u201d voting block with \u201cgreat political power\u201d.

Taken together, the pattern is startling, and for the first time, the letter\u2019s organizer, director David Felix Sutcliffe, has catalogued many of these incidents in one place.</p> <p>After Castile\u2019s fiance, Diamond Reynolds, filmed his dying moments on Facebook Live, she was cuffed, locked in a police car, separated from her child and held in police custody for eight hours. \u201cMy daughter will be forever scarred by what the police did,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.revelist.com/us-news/diamond-reynolds-video-philando-castile/3468\">she said afterwards</a>. \u201cThey took me to jail.

The man who filmed the Eric Garner murder, Ramsey Orta, <a href=\"http://m.democracynow.org/stories/15861\">accused the NYPD</a> of stalking him afterwards and filming him. He was eventually arrested multiple times and <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/man-filmed-eric-garner-chokehold-plea-deal-article-1.2701695\">recently pled guilty</a> to weapons charges. Two weeks after Kevin Moore filmed part of the Freddie Gray incident, he was arrested while police pointed assault rifles at him (no charges were filed). He later <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/we-spoke-to-kevin-moore-the-man-who-filmed-freddie-grays-arrest\">told Vice News</a>: \u201cPolice sit outside my son\u2019s school. And they ride past taunting me with their phones up.\u201d</p> <p>Taken together, these incidents show a clear pattern of abuse and this should be a controversy in and of itself. Almost all police departments have been forced to concede in recent years that everyone in the United States has a first amendment right to record the police in public spaces. So while they can\u2019t prosecute people for filming them killing unarmed civilians, it\u2019s clear that police departments are using their position of power to intimidate those who have led to more scrutiny of police and to send a message to those who may attempt to do so in the future.</p> <p>Sutcliffe, who co-directed the documentary <a href=\"http://terrordocumentary.org/\">(T)error</a> that relied on unauthorized footage of entrapment stings by the FBI, wrote that he was inspired to organize the campaign because of the fear of government retribution nearly led to the film being suppressed. \u201cFortunately,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe documentary community rallied to defend us, and denounced the threat posed by our circumstances, not just to the fate of our film but to free speech and a free press.\u201d</p> <p>Those who record and publicize police violence deserve the same. But more than that, they deserve to have their first amendment rights protected \u2013 not just as they film, but afterwards \u2013 to prevent the next person from being frightened off before they turn on their camera. </p>",

Glad it doesn\u2019t happen here.\u201d So that was that.</p> <p>Now, I see my daughters and their friends going through it, and most of them are fairly combative, but some are not. They never quite know if it\u2019s their own fault; they are full of fear where there should be fire. (A colleague of mine once tipped hot candlewax over a customer in the restaurant we worked in. It made my night.)</p> <p>But this is hardly a workable strategy. In insecure working conditions, everyone is scared of making a fuss \u2013 but women are scared of their own co-workers, as well as their bosses.</p> <p>I read this week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/10/half-of-women-uk-have-been-sexually-harassed-at-work-tuc-study-everyday-sexism\" title=\"\">TUC survey about harassment in the workplace, which polled 1,553&#xa0;women and found 52% of them had been sexually harrassed at work</a>. This is not anecdotal; it has happened to half of all women. Among women and girls aged&#xa0;16-24, the proportion reporting sexual harassment rose to 63%. It includes jokes, banter, being touched and being threatened: all the things that men do to women because they can.&#xa0;It is about power.</p> <p>Who&#xa0;wants to make a fuss? In a world of zero-hours contracts, you cannot ask the union for support. Sexual harassment in the workplace may be dismissed as trivial. But it is significant not only because it undermines women, but also because it shows how we are going backwards. Low-paid workers have few rights \u2013 and who is there to defend them? We may have a female prime minister, but you wouldn\u2019t know it, as the great men of the left scream, warrior-like, to each other about betrayals. Yet the most important betrayal is becoming more and more clear. If a party founded for the workers (the clue is in the name: \u201cLabour\u201d) cannot promote women in its own workplace, then how can it look after the lowest-paid and most harassed workers of all?</p> <p>Sure, I know there is the great new social movement of Momentum, but look at Labour\u2019s jobs for the boys. All the new city mayors will, amazingly, be blokes! I am sure there is nothing wrong with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/andy-burnham-selected-labours-candidate-manchester-mayor\" title=\"\">Andy Burnham</a>, <a href=\"http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/who-sion-simon-labour-candidate-11725914\" title=\"\">Si\u00f4n Simon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/23/bristol-mayor-marvin-rees-racism-inequality\" title=\"\">Marvin Rees</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/10/corbyn-ally-steve-rotheram-named-as-candidate-for-liverpool-city-region-mayor\" title=\"\">Steve Rotheram</a>. I am sure no women were up to it. There never are.

But are we not concerned that women cannot be what they cannot see in public life? In politics, in film, girls need to see that they have possibilities. Power. Westminster is a hostile workplace. We know that. To create an extra-parliamentary social movement, one would assume this was one place where women could be valued equally. I don\u2019t expect Corbyn\u2019s crew to do this. They are a type. They pay lip-service to feminism, but they never create the conditions for it to thrive. It\u2019s just not an organising principle for them.</p> <p>This does not mean that young, bright women are not attracted by the idea of doing things differently. But where are they going to find their&#xa0;place in this party that seeks not exactly winning, not exactly government, but some greater, unfathomable goal?</p> <p>Good activists have already touched every feminist base. Who needs actual women? They believe in equality, they are beyond gender, they can\u2019t possibly be misogynists because they are not rightwing. The absence of women is probably something to do with neoliberalism. Or Mercury in retrograde. Who knows?</p> <p>The dynamics of power, the recognition and&#xa0;promotion of men by other men, remain invisible to those who enact them. Empowerment is one&#xa0;part of this. Disempowerment is another. That is what sexual harassment is. That is why it&#xa0;is serious. That is why I look to the left and feel&#xa0;empty.</p> <p>This is a very conservative time. At the top of the tree, Donald Trump can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\" title=\"\">hint that he thinks Hillary Clinton should be assassinated</a>. Meanwhile, some young girl gets pushed up against the stockroom wall and groped.</p> <p>The absence of women in power has to be tackled directly and politically. The harassment of&#xa0;women without it, depends on it. If Labour won\u2019t do it, others will. This is only the province of the left if you make it so. The party of the workers is choosing not to.</p>",
  "<p>On the day Bob Kiley was appointed to run Transport for London, the capital\u2019s Evening Standard ran the banner headline: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/10/nyregion/10KILE.html\">New York Tough Guy to Run the Tube</a>. The mayor Ken Livingstone\u2019s decision to look overseas for his first TfL chief officer (the government had previously appointed an interim one) in 2001 was a sign of how important the new transport agency was to become. Kiley, who has died aged 80, had previously run the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in New York City, which runs the railway, subway and bus system. By choosing an overseas official, Livingstone brought enhanced stature to the new role.</p> <p>Kiley was styled \u201ccommissioner\u201d, revealing the US influence on the then new office of London mayor. The Metropolitan police had always been led by a commissioner, not a chief constable, but Livingstone aggrandised the Greater London Authority\u2019s transport and fire chiefs by giving them the same title. Soon after Kiley\u2019s appointment, a British diplomat told him he was \u201cthe most important American to come to Britain since Dwight Eisenhower\u201d.</p> <p>TfL\u2019s first commissioner had taken an unusual path to what most people still called London Transport. He was born in Minneapolis, the son of Raymond Kiley, a Woolworth executive, and his wife, Georgianna (nee Smith). He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, then attended Harvard graduate school and was president of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Student_Association\">National Student Association</a>, which was backed by the CIA. He went on to work for the agency at its headquarters in Langley, Virginia, where he became manager of intelligence operations and executive assistant to the then director, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/oct/24/guardianobituaries.haroldjackson\">Richard Helms</a>.</p> <p>In 1974 he was appointed deputy mayor of Boston, and was responsible for public safety during protests against the court-ordered desegregation of schools. He said his priority was \u201cto make certain children weren\u2019t killed as a result of Boston\u2019s massive inattention to the inevitability of school desegregation\u201d. None were.</p> <p>In 1975 he was appointed by Michael Dukakis, governor of Massachusetts, to head up the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, with responsibility for transport systems in Greater Boston. He reduced political patronage and union privileges while extending rail services. From 1979 to 1983 he worked as a management consultant before taking up the position of chairman and chief executive of the MTA.</p> <p>The subway was infamously decrepit, grimy, graffiti-covered and dangerous at the time. Kiley\u2019s predecessor, Richard Ravitch, had started the process of raising capital investment resources from the New York State legislature, a process that Kiley continued. He brought in Bill Bratton (also from Boston) to head the transit police. He observed of the MTA that \u201cthe root of the problem, along with years of disinvestment, was the absence of real management: hardly anyone could be held accountable for the performance of some 51,000 employees\u201d. Air-conditioned trains were introduced along with major station improvements. Punctuality, safety and passenger numbers improved significantly.</p> <p>On leaving the MTA in 1990, Kiley moved to the private sector, first in construction and then to a private equity company. In 1995 he became president and chief executive of the <a href=\"http://pfnyc.org/\">New York City Partnership</a>, a business-led good government organisation. Then, when Livingstone was seeking candidates for the TfL role, his headhunters found Kiley. There was some controversy about the appointment: not only was he to be paid more than any public official in Britain, but he was to be provided with a grace-and-favour home in Belgravia. Livingstone observed at the time: \u201cHaving decided who was the best candidate, we would not allow money to become an issue.\u201d</p> <p>With Livingstone, Kiley set about building TfL into by far the country\u2019s largest local transport operator, but also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/oct/12/ppp\">opposing Gordon Brown\u2019s public-private partnership</a> for the underground. The PPP involved, at great public expense, hiving off the maintenance and rebuilding of the system to private companies. TfL eventually took full control of the tube when the PPP collapsed.</p> <p>Kiley was successful in combining the different elements of London\u2019s transport system, including buses, the tube, taxi regulation, river services, major roads and trams. During his term of office, the congestion charge and Oyster card were introduced. These massive IT-based systems were a great success and showed that TfL, unlike many parts of Whitehall, was able to manage major procurement exercises and computer systems.</p> <p>In the early years of his tenure he was regularly photographed, often in a rumpled overcoat with a high collar, with Livingstone riding the tube. He and his second wife, Rona (nee Shuman), used their London home to entertain leading personalities from politics, the media, the judiciary and the arts. They were, it became clear, extremely well connected within the establishment. His tenure as transport commissioner ended rather sadly in 2006, when it was revealed he had problems with alcohol.</p> <p>His first wife, Patricia, and their two children were killed in a car accident in New York in 1974. He is survived by Rona, their two sons, and a granddaughter. <br><strong>Tony Travers</strong></p> <p><strong>Peter Hendy writes: </strong>In 2000, Ken Livingstone was elected first mayor of London. For his new transport authority, Transport for London, he rejected the \u201cdullards\u201d he thought ran the previously state-owned London Transport. His staff called Bob in New York \u2013 did Bob know any US transit people who would be interested? He didn\u2019t, but was then persuaded to be interested himself.</p> <p>He and Rona arrived as celebrities and gave both TfL and the new mayoralty a high public profile. He prompted Ken to be an even bolder mayor than he would have naturally been. His choreography of the opposition to the ill-fated PPP for the underground was superb, even if at the time unsuccessful; no Briton would have been so bold as to directly challenge the prime minister and chancellor \u2013 Bob did, fearlessly. He predicted it would fail and, in my time as commissioner, it duly did so.</p> <p>His was a hands-off style; he spent more time with the mayor and the media than managing the organisation. His grasp of city and national governance across the developed world was remarkable; he regarded the British state as only marginally less centralised than North Korea \u2013 as he said, \u201cthe UK hadn\u2019t had a decent revolution for 400 years\u201d \u2013 and thought the consequent lack of direct tax-raising powers in London lamentable. He helped Ken put the mayoralty firmly on the world stage and to put the city\u2019s transport authority there too. It was a privilege to work with him, to learn from him, and to succeed him.</p> <p>\u2022 Robert Raymond Kiley, transport executive, born 16 September 1935; died 9 August 2016</p>",
  "<p>Isn\u2019t there a wonderful irony in our admiration for the feats of US and British swimmers at the Olympics this week? We may applaud gold medalists Michael Phelps and Adam Peaty as they scythe through the pool with exquisite hydrodynamic skill, but <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/us-swimmers-top-podium-most-americans-struggle-pool/\">54% of Americans would not pass a basic swim test</a>. There\u2019s a potentially fatal disconnect, it seems, between ourselves and the water.</p> <p>I feared the pool at school, partly because our teacher was a former army officer who\u2019d ignore weaklings like me floundering about with my fingernails dug into a plastic float while the sports heroes earned his encouraging words. As result, I was in my late 20s before I confronted my aquatic demons. Now I swim every day in the sea, winter or summer, rain or snow. This morning I was there in the dark at 4am, looking for shooting stars. For me it\u2019s not about exercise. Rather, it\u2019s a subversion, inspired by heroes such as Katharine Hepburn, famous for swimming in the ice off her home in Fenwick, Connecticut. \u201cIt\u2019s stimulating and it\u2019s fun,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause it irritates everybody. It makes them cowards.\u201d</p> <p>Following the example of Miss Hepburn (with whom I once spend a <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/portrait-of-a-lady-111105.html\">memorable morning</a> in her Upper East Side house, where she tried to feed me crabmeat from a half-open can), I swim off Cape Cod in January, following the advice of the New York Times of 23 August 1883, which recommends the Cape shores to \u201cthose looking for good surf-bathing\u201d, so empty even on a summer\u2019s day that \u201cif one wishes to go in in his bare pelt he may do so without the fear of shocking propriety\u201d. I swim there in the summer too, occasionally in the company of John Waters, who hitchhikes to the beach. (We once got a ride in a cop car. John quipped as we got out: \u201cWe\u2019ve been paroled to the beach\u201d).</p> <p>The summer stirs our relationship with the water, and swimming has a noble tradition in the United States, a rebellious republic bound from sea to shining sea. The act of abandoning land and gravity has a sensual, even decadent air. On his 1882 tour of the US, which turned him into an international celebrity, Oscar Wilde <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/2015/05/orchid-prairies\">spent an extended stay on Fire Island</a>, already fashionable as a resort for New Yorker swimmers. Frank Leslie\u2019s Illustrated Newspaper portrayed him in flowing Pre-Raphaelite locks and a <a href=\"http://www.oscarwildeinamerica.org/features/a-scene-at-long-beach.html\">daringly tight</a> swimming costume, the ultimate in aesthetic undress. Wilde\u2019s son said his father swam like a powerful shark. Wilde v Phelps swim-off, anyone?</p> <p>More obviously macho was Jack London, self-declared \u201cblond beast\u201d and highest paid author in the world by 1913. An inveterate swimmer, London wrote ecstatically of midnight swims \u201cunder the starshine\u201d in water \u201cwarm as tepid milk. The good salt taste of it was in his mouth, the tingling of it along his limbs; and the steady beat of his heart, heavy and strong, made him glad for living.\u201d</p> <p>But Henry David Thoreau is my man when it comes to transcendental swims. It was one of the reasons for building his hut at Walden: \u201cI got up early and bathed in the pond; that was a religious exercise, and one of the best things I did.\u201d The philosopher even tried to analysise the colour of the water \u2013 \u201clying between the earth and the heavens, it partakes of the color of both\u201d. Less idyllically, modern analysis of Walden Pond in midsummer reveals a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/10/why-has-the-olympic-pool-turned-green-the-good-news-is-its-not-urine\">high volume of human urine</a>.</p> <p>Swimming was also an essential part of Thoreau\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.thoreausociety.org/news-article/threshold-chaos-henry-thoreau-cape-cod-elizabeth-kalman-nicholas-holdgate\">celebrated visits</a> to Cape Cod.</p> <p> Locals told him there was \u201cno bathing on the Atlantic side, on account of the undertow and the rumour of sharks\u201d. Undeterred, he continued to swim there, \u201conly observing first from the bank if the cove was preoccupied\u201d. At Ballston beach, where I\u2019ve skinny-dipped in the company of passing humpback whales, Chris Myers <a href=\"http://archive.boston.com/metrodesk/2012/08/03/man-who-survived-shark-attack-off-ballston-beach-truro-calls-himself-very-lucky/RC6VoTuTt23Rt8Liy7tOfL/story.html \">was bitten</a> by a great white shark in 2012, sustaining severe injuries to his legs.

  "<p>Oliver Hughes, who has died of a heart attack aged 57, was known as the godfather of the Irish beer revolution. His pioneering Porterhouse pubs and brewery brought much-needed choice to Irish drinkers and, while he was a minnow in an ocean of stout, his mere presence annoyed Guinness.</p> <p>There are now about 50 small breweries in the republic, challenging the hegemony of the duopoly of Guinness and Murphy\u2019s, the latter owned by Heineken. The existence of that growing independent sector was inspired by Oliver\u2019s determination to create diversity for beer drinkers.</p> <p>Born in Dublin, he was the only child of Lillian and Brian, a barrister whose work took the family to Fiji, where he served as a magistrate. They later moved to the UK, where Brian practised in Nottingham and Scunthorpe. Oliver studied law at Hatfield Polytechnic (now the University of Hertfordshire) and, while drinking in pubs in Hatfield and neighbouring St Albans, he came into contact with Alan Swannell, one of the early microbrewers of the 1980s, who ran tiny breweries in Kings Langley and Ware.</p> <p>With his cousin and future business partner Liam LaHart, Oliver went to folk concerts organised by the Irish community in Kilburn, north-west London, and the pair also took part in Troops Out demonstrations and campaigned for the release of the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four. In London they came across the groundbreaking chain of Firkin brewpubs run by <a href=\"http://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk/Operators/PMA500-Business-Club/The-Big-Interview-David-Bruce-City-Pub-Company\" title=\"\">David Bruce</a>. Oliver and Liam were impressed by beers with quirky names such as Dogbolter and T-shirts with slogans such as: \u201cIf you nick my pint I\u2019ll firkin punch you.\u201d Oliver said the Firkins were the model for the future Porterhouse pubs.</p> <p>Back in Dublin, Oliver practised as a barrister between 1989 and 1999. But he was still enthused by brewing, and with Liam he opened a brewery called Harty\u2019s in County Wicklow. It failed after two years because, Oliver sai,: \u201cWe brewed beer for publicans who wouldn\u2019t pay the bills\u201d. Undaunted, the pair opened the first Porterhouse pub in Bray. They hired \u201ca man with a van\u201d who drove to Europe to bring back previously unknown beers from Belgium and Germany. They also sold beer from another early Irish micro, Galway Hooker.</p> <p>\u201cWe discovered years later,\u201d Oliver recalled, \u201cthat other publicans had opened a book on how long we would survive in a pub that didn\u2019t serve Guinness. Some said two days, others six months.\u201d</p> <p>But Oliver and Liam had touched a nerve with Irish drinkers, and in 1996 they opened a Firkin-inspired Porterhouse brewpub in Temple Bar, Dublin. I was an early visitor to the pub on Parliament Street, a three-storey building with a 10-barrel brewery that restored a famous Dublin style called Plain, the local name for porter made famous by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/30/my-hero-flann-obrien-sansom\" title=\"\">Flann O\u2019Brien</a> in his poem A Pint of Plain is Your Only Man.</p> <p>Oyster Stout used real oysters, restoring another old Irish tradition. The stand-out beer for me was Wrasslers 4X Stout, based on a recipe from a long-defunct brewery called Deasy\u2019s in west Cork: it was the favourite beer of Michael Collins, founder of the Irish Free State.</p> <p>Oliver\u2019s ability to get up the noses of big brewers was shown when he was threatened with legal action by Anheuser-Busch and Carlsberg over a wheat beer called Weiserbuddy and a lager dubbed Probably, which was brewed at the Porterhouse. Anheuser-Busch owns Budweiser, the biggest brand in the US, where it is known simply as Bud, while Carlsberg is famous for its long-running promotion that claims the beer is: \u201cProbably the best lager in the world.\u201d Oliver\u2019s legal training told him he would have to change the names before the writs arrived, but he ensured maximum publicity for his beers and pub.</p> <p>Oliver and Liam expanded. They opened a vast Porterhouse in Covent Garden, London, and two more followed in Dublin, including the equally vast Porterhouse Central on Nassau Street, with their long-standing beers joined by a cask-conditioned real ale, TSB, and Dublin Pale Ale. \u201cWe were the first brewery to make pale ale in Ireland,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cNobody knew what it was and we had to teach people about hops.\u201d</p> <p>Restless and energetic, Oliver and Liam added restaurants and a nightclub called <a href=\"http://lilliesbordello.ie\" title=\"\">Lillie\u2019s Bordello</a> in Dublin, built a standalone brewery outside the city to supply their pubs and free trade, and turned <a href=\"http://www.frauncestavern.com\" title=\"\">Fraunces Tavern</a> in Manhattan into a Porterhouse. The tavern is the oldest inn in New York and famous as the place where George Washington said farewell to his troops at the end of the War of Independence. The site pleased Oliver\u2019s quiet but passionate republicanism. The Porterhouse group now employs 500 people and exports beer to the US, Italy, Spain and Scandinavia.</p> <p>I once arranged to meet Oliver in Porterhouse Central on Nassau Street in 2012. He was very late, as timekeeping was not his strong point. I\u2019d been travelling all day and urgently needed food. \u201cLet\u2019s go and eat,\u201d he said, and marched me off to a nearby restaurant where we dined on superb Spanish tapas. \u201cWho owns this place?\u201d I asked innocently. \u201cI do,\u201d he replied.</p> <p>His last enterprise was a <a href=\"http://www.dingledistillery.ie/distillery/\" title=\"\">whiskey distillery</a> built in 2012 in a redundant sawmill in Dingle on the west coast of Ireland, the first new distillery in the country for 200 years.</p> <p>Irrepressible and unstoppable, he said his rule of thumb for running successful pubs and breweries was \u201cto watch what the big players do... and avoid it\u201d.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Helen, and by their children, Elliot and Holly.</p> <p>\u2022 Oliver Hughes, brewer and publican, born 20 May 1959; died 30 July 2016</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 August 2016. As a barrister in Ireland, Oliver Hughes had a civil and criminal rather than a purely criminal practice, and did not take silk (become a senior counsel).</p>",
  "<p>Theresa May entered Downing Street pledging to stitch a divided Britain into one nation, but it turns out we\u2019re still a long way even from one household.</p> <p>Writing in <a href=\"http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/top-10-brands-favoured-remainers-brexiters/1403991#\">Campaign magazine</a>, Emily James, chief strategy officer at creative agency RKCR/Y&amp;R, details how she went through YouGov\u2019s tracking survey \u2013 which monitors about 1,200 brands \u2013 and cross-referenced the data with how individuals voted in the EU referendum, to arrive at a wildly different top 10 list for each tribe.</p> <p>The results suggest that leavers favour slathering Bisto and HP Sauce on their plate of Cathedral City cheese-topped Richmond sausages bought from Iceland, flipping between Sky and ITV News to check their numbers on the Health Lottery (and with that diet, maybe they need to).</p> <p>Meanwhile, the remainian family at the bottom of the road never eats. These glowing bulwarks of technological progress simply waft around on several of Steve Jobs\u2019 finest interfaces: looking up iPlayer programmes they have read about on bbc.co.uk, putting an anodyne playlist on Spotify and tweeting furiously about being on the losing side, as they book a holiday to Tuscany via Virgin Trains, London Underground, EasyJet and Airbnb.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/10/brexit-outsiders-comedy-tv-sitcom\">Depressed about Brexit?

Leave brands, she points out, are \u201ctraditional, straightforward, simple, down to earth, good value and friendly\u201d. On the other hand, the uniting stripe of the top 10 remain marques is that they are \u201cprogressive, up to date, visionary, innovative, socially responsible, intelligent\u201d.</p> <p>The obvious answer for James is that any prime minister in a hurry should make their basic ideas simple, trad and down to earth, but in a progressive, innovative, smart way. She points to sites that were ranked equally by both groups \u2013 Money Saving Expert, the NSPCC, TK Maxx and M&amp;S. Money Saving Expert, for instance, presents intelligent analysis in a way that is also very straightforward. M&amp;S offers the soul of simple, quality, olde worlde Britishness, with the marketing vigour of a cutting-edge supermarket.</p> <p>The answer seems clear. James doesn\u2019t say as much, but it\u2019s obvious how Britain\u2019s culture wars can be resolved by a leader whose very initials imply trademark licensing. We\u2019re imagining the following key planks in Theresa\u2019s nation-suturing manifesto:</p> <p>\u2022 Let\u2019s kick out foreigners.

  "<p>Chris Froome\u2019s ambitions to improve on the bronze medal he won in the men\u2019s time trial at London 2012 were thwarted when he had to settle for another bronze behind Fabian Cancellara and Tom Dumoulin. Despite the contention by British Cycling\u2019s Andy Harrison that Froome has been suffering from a tight chest that had affected his performances here, the cyclist said there were no medical issues and that he was fine.</p> <p>There will be no more popular winner than the Swiss 35-year-old, who won from Dumoulin by 47 seconds.

It began and ended in Portal, on the outskirts of Rio about 30km west along the coast from where the road race peloton went under the gun. Taking in two circuits of the Grumari Circuit, that hilly tree-lined 25km loop the field tackled twice on Sunday, the riders were allowed to bypass the cobbles that had done for so many inner tubes and poorly holstered water bottles at the weekend.</p> <p>Not to be confused with the Vista Chinesa, whose treacherous descent claimed, among several others, the men\u2019s and women\u2019s road race leaders, Vincenzo Nibali and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/07/annemiek-van-vleuten-intensive-care-olympic-road-race\" title=\"\">Annemiek van Vleuten</a>, in serious crashes, the Grumari Circuit boasts two significant climbs. The eponymous ascent snakes to a height of 129m at a gradient of around 12% and precedes a tricky, twisting, often narrow descent. The subsequent Grota Funda climb is longer but significantly more straightforward. Rising to two kilometres at a little under 7%, considerably less concentration is required to negotiate the meandering downhill that follows.</p> <p>Set-up was all important and most riders opted for a rear disc wheel and clip-on handlebars and eschewed the option of a deep-rimmed front wheel to minimise wind resistance and offer better handling. One of the exceptions, drafted in due to late withdrawals of the lame and halt from the road race, was the bearded Namibian Dan Craven, who was first down the ramp on a borrowed bicycle and finished well behind several of the riders who set off after him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d43aa40c7baedd3705258bb9d26304f26e851419\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d43aa40c7baedd3705258bb9d26304f26e851419/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Froome in action on his way to bronze.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Froome in action on his way to bronze.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pool/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Team GB\u2019s Geraint Thomas, still bearing the raw tattoos of his sickening crash on Vista Chinesa when looking good for a medal in the road race, was not forced to slum it.

Alec has consistently lobbied to cut government spending on programs that benefit seniors and has close ties to pharmaceutical companies.<br></p> <p>\u201cAfter hearing from many of you, we\u2019ve decided not to renew our membership to Alec.

  "<p>To say that Gerald Grosvenor was born with a silver spoon in his mouth would be an exaggeration. But the estates he inherited from his father in 1979 when he became the 6th Duke of Westminster certainly furnished the equivalent of many canteens of silverware.</p> <p>Through recent generations, his family had always been regarded as the wealthiest in Britain and although that position has now slipped slightly, the Duke, who has died suddenly aged 64 after being taken ill at the Abbeystead estate, one of his properties in Lancashire, was still considered the third richest person in Britain. Earlier this year, his wealth was estimated at about \u00a39.3bn.</p> <p>That wealth was built partly on investments, but mainly on property across Britain, Europe, the US and the far east, and especially in central London. The Duke\u2019s ancestor Hugh Lupus \u2013 the king\u2019s head huntsman or <em>grand veneur</em>, a tubby man nicknamed <em>gros veneur</em>, from which derived the family surname \u2013 came across with William the Conqueror and was granted a chunk of Cheshire to protect the region from the Welsh. But it was a profitable marriage in 1677 that secured boggy farmland in what became the Mayfair and Belgravia areas of London that really cemented the family fortunes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77b7afd5c185d29f8fde368dd89e5e2a88819e64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77b7afd5c185d29f8fde368dd89e5e2a88819e64/11_55_3601_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Duke of Westminster greets the Prince of Wales during the celebrations for The Queen\u2019s Own Yeomanry\u2019s 40th anniversary in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Duke of Westminster greets the Prince of Wales during the celebrations for The Queen\u2019s Own Yeomanry\u2019s 40th anniversary in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They still hold 300 acres of it, including Grosvenor Square, where they are the landlords of the American embassy, part of Oxford Street and other now desirable addresses, many bearing family names. There are also estates in Oxfordshire, Cheshire \u2013 10,872 acres around the country seat at Eaton Hall \u2013 110,000 acres in Sutherland, and shopping malls and other property as far afield as Los Angeles and Australia.</p> <p>Yet the 6th Duke\u2019s great wealth appeared to be more a responsibility than a pleasure to him. He suffered from depression and in 1998 had a nervous breakdown caused by the stress of business and public appearances. \u201cGiven the choice I would rather not have been born wealthy, but I never think of giving it up. I can\u2019t sell it. It doesn\u2019t belong to me,\u201d he told an interviewer, adding, when he appeared on BBC Radio 4\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0093pds?ns_mchannel=social&amp;\">Desert Island Discs</a> in 1995: \u201cIn the context of eternity, if I am lucky I might live 70 years, but this estate has been with us for 3, 4, 5, 600 years. I am only a mere flicker in the process of time. It is what I do with it, rather than what I am worth, that I believe is more important.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike some of his predecessors, such as Bendor, the 2nd Duke, who lavished diamonds on his lover Coco Chanel and wanted Britain to ally with Hitler, the 6th Duke gave to and supported a string of charities and other worthy causes \u2013 \u00a3500,000 to farmers hit by the 2001 foot and mouth crisis, for instance \u2013 and served diligently on the boards of many military and other charities, including <a href=\"http://www.emmaus.org.uk\">Emmaus</a>, for the homeless, for more than 40 years.</p> <p>As he confided on the BBC programme, however, he found a private plane handy for hopping from Cheshire to his office in London and he and his wife did not hesitate to rebuild Eaton Hall in the French chateau style less than 20 years after it had been rebuilt \u201clike a 1960s Inn on the Park\u201d by his uncle \u2013 the family have a penchant for that sort of thing, having enlarged the house three times in the 19th century alone.</p> <p>Gerald Grosvenor came into the line of succession only because the 3rd Duke was childless and the title passed to a cousin, who became 4th Duke in 1963 and then, when he died four years later, to his younger brother, Gerald\u2019s father, Robert Grosvenor, who farmed in Northern Ireland and lived on an island in Lough Erne. He was the Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone until he succeeded as 5th Duke, and was married to Viola Lyttelton, daughter of Viscount Cobham.</p> <p>Their son had an idyllic childhood on the farm, interrupted when he was sent to a prep school at Sunningdale in Berkshire at the age of seven and then to Harrow, which he left with two O-levels, in English and history. \u201cI was not motivated at school. I was unhappy. I never applied myself. I found it very difficult to make friends,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not need O-levels to lead, to have judgment, to make decisions and to be decided.\u201d Nevertheless, in later life he would serve several universities, as pro-chancellor of Keele, then chancellor of Manchester Metropolitan and first chancellor of Chester.</p> <p>He learned of his likely inheritance only when his father told him at the age of 15. \u201cIt almost made me run for the door, slam it and keep running,\u201d he said. \u201cThe implications were daunting. In Ulster I was called Gerald all my life and there was no question of titles, \u2018Your Grace this, Your Grace that\u2019. I find it very embarrassing when people ask what they should call me \u2013 then, I stumble.\u201d</p> <p>Although he had to start learning the management of the family estates instead of taking up an army career as intended, Grosvenor did serve with the Territorials, in the Queen\u2019s Own Yeomanry cavalry regiment, rising through the ranks, attending the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst and eventually becoming a major-general and assistant chief of the defence staff with responsibility for the army reserves and cadets.</p> <p>In 2007 he stood down after he was named as a user of a New York escort service called the Emperors Club \u2013 he resigned his chairmanship of the Grosvenor Group, the family estates\u2019 holding company, at the same time \u2013 though he subsequently rejoined the Territorials once more, as a trooper in the ranks, for a further five years. His last project was raising money from wealthy corporate and individual donors for the building of a \u00a3300m <a href=\"http://www.thednrc.org.uk/\">rehabilitation centre</a> for psychologically damaged servicemen near Loughborough.</p> <p>The Duke\u2019s attitude to his property empire was one of noblesse oblige: when Westminster council proposed selling off a housing estate in Pimlico, intended by his ancestors specifically for the use of the working classes, he took the council to court (Westminster claimed that the working class no longer existed) and won. But he resigned from the Conservative party in 1993 over its leasehold reform legislation, giving long-serving tenants the right to buy their properties. It was, he told Desert Island Discs, the thin end of the wedge, equivalent to the taking of one owner\u2019s property for the benefit of another: \u201cI had to leave because of my own conscience. I took a moral stand.\u201d</p> <p>In 1978 he married Natalia Phillips \u2013 a descendant of the Russian author Pushkin and Tsar Nicholas I. She survives him, along with their three daughters, Tamara, Edwina and Viola, and a son, Hugh, who succeeds to the title.</p> <p>\u2022 Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster, landowner, born 22 December 1951; died 9 August 2016</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 August 2016.

  "<p>In the midst of a political season in which all eyes are on the US presidential election, one of America\u2019s largest political advocacy groups devoted to women\u2019s rights is turning its attention to a new mission: state legislative races.</p> <p>Emily\u2019s List, a group that traditionally focuses on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/07/new-hampshire-female-governor-maggie-hassan-emilys-list\">electing individual pro-choice women to office</a>, announced a new plan to target seven vulnerable states where organizers believe they can flip the some of legislatures from red to blue \u2013 and then, perhaps more permanently, do the same for the US Congress.</p> <p>The idea is that if the group can help elect enough Democratic women in state legislatures by the 2021 congressional redistricting cycle, it will be able to swing both many state houses and the House of Representatives in favor of Democrats, and make them more likely to pass legislation in favor of reproductive rights and women\u2019s equality.</p> <p>\u201cCurrently, Republicans control 68 of 98 legislative chambers in the United States,\u201d said Emily\u2019s List president Stephanie Schriock. \u201cThat\u2019s a result of the 2010 elections, when the Democrats lost so many state legislatures.\u201d</p> <p>Once there, she said, \u201cRepublicans gerrymandered a huge number of Congressional seats,\u201d a reference to the constitutionally protected redistricting process, leading to the Republican takeover in the US House. They also pushed what she termed \u201can extreme anti-choice legislative movement\u201d on the state and federal level, while blocking any progress on equal pay legislation, childcare assistance, paid sick time and family leave.</p> <p>The women of Emily\u2019s List want that to stop. To that end, on Tuesday the organization launched Focus 2020, vowing to help elect enough pro-choice Democratic women in 2016, 2018, 2020 and beyond that they will be able to build Democratic legislative majorities in 14 states in time to affect the partisan makeup of the US Congress.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to end this process of gerrymandering by Republicans,\u201d Schriock added. \u201cWe have to make sure that we have fair districts in this country, so that we can fight over ideas, not process.\u201d</p> <p>First up in 2016, Emily\u2019s List is pushing candidates in Michigan, Maine, New Hampshire, Nevada, Minnesota, New Mexico and Colorado \u2013 all states that have passed or nearly passed anti-abortion legislation over the last few years.</p> <p>In Colorado, widely seen at the original home of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/29/colorado-personhood-fails-signatures-ballot\">so-called \u201cpersonhood\u201d movement</a> \u2013 which attempts to define fetuses as people under the law and thereby classify abortion and even some methods of birth control as murder \u2013 the senate went from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2014/11/08/colorado-state-senate-majority/115049/\">blue to red in 2014</a>, after a razor-slim Democratic majority created by the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/gun-lobby-democrats-colorado-connecticut\">recall</a> of two pro-gun-control senators in 2013 failed to hold.</p> <p>To change that, Emily\u2019s List has endorsed three pro-choice women in state senate races there, though Democrats only need to pick up two seats. Rachel Zenzinger, who is challenging a Republican incumbent, Laura Woods, to retake the seat she she lost to Woods by 663 votes in 2014 is one of them.</p> <p>Zenzinger described her race as taking place in \u201ca swing district in a swing country in a swing state\u201d where \u201cyou would think [Woods] would be trying to defend and protect women and women\u2019s issues, but she\u2019s done the exact opposite\u201d.</p> <p>Woods supported a variety of anti-abortion bills in the last session, including ones that Zenzinger said \u201cranged from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://rewire.news/article/2016/04/22/forced-waiting-period-mandated-ultrasound-measures-go-down/\">mandatory, invasive ultrasounds</a> to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://coloradopols.com/diary/82515/woods-we-are-concerned-about-the-abortions-behind-the-tissue#sthash.LgsodMzP.dpbs\">defunding a local university because it used fetal tissue for research</a>\u201d, in addition to one that would have <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.lambornforcongress.org/index.php/articles/it-is-time-to-defund-planned-parenthood\">defunded Planned Parenthood</a>.</p> <p>Given the anti-abortion movement\u2019s history of unsuccessfully putting \u201c<a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/the-perfect-storm-may-be-brewing-in-colorado-to-pass-a-personhood-law-aeb2903308ae#.7n58rx9m9\">personhood</a>\u201d legislation on the ballot, Zenzinger believes that many Republicans \u201cwill try to seek action legislatively, where they have the opportunity to control the agenda if they are able to maintain the Republican majority\u201d in the state senate.</p> <p>But beyond the immediate concerns for reproductive rights in the state, Zenzinger said that if her party fails to regain a majority presence in the state senate by 2020, her constituents will see a \u201csignificant rolling back of the clock, just trying to go back and undo some of the good, progressive work that has been done over the past few years that really benefited everybody in Colorado\u201d \u2013 let alone anything that might be on a Democratic president\u2019s agenda.</p> <p>Last April, the <a href=\"http://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/2015/04/michigan_house_passes_379_bill.html\">Michigan state House of Representatives passed a budget defunding Planned Parenthood</a>. It\u2019s another state where Emily\u2019s List is backing candidates under the Focus 2020 initiative in an attempt to bring that state\u2019s house of representatives back under a Democratic majority. One of these candidates is Collene Lamonte. Like Zenzinger in Colorado, Lamonte also lost a seat she held during the 2014 midterm elections. She\u2019s running to regain the seat she lost to a Republican opponent.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of issues in Michigan, things are not able to move forward because of a lack of women in our political system right now. <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/story/life/family/kristen-jordan-shamus/2015/03/22/gender-wage-gap-michigan/25200671/\">Pay equity in our state is a huge issue</a> \u2013 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.aauw.org/files/2014/09/Michigan-Pay-Gap-2014.pdf\">Michigan is lower than the national average</a> when it comes to pay equity for women.

We need to ensure that women receive proper access to healthcare when they need it, without facing barriers.\u201d</p> <p>In 2018, Emily\u2019s List plans to expand its focus to Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin \u2013 many of which have legislatures that are notoriously hostile to women\u2019s reproductive rights, and some of which have voted for national Democrats even while their Congressional delegations skew Republican.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that we have three full election cycles ahead of us,\u201d said Schriock. But if Republicans are able to gerrymander as many districts in 2021 as they did in 2011, \u201cwomen for generations are going to be left behind in this country.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Margaret Atwood\u2019s most recent novel, The Heart Goes Last, began as an unusual digital experiment. Starting in March 2012, the website Byliner played host to the \u201cPositron series\u201d: a sequence of interconnected stories published gradually over the course of a year, which Atwood claimed was an attempt to revive a literary tradition of serialisation, popular from the halcyon days of Charles Dickens up through the 1950s.</p> <p>First came the opening section, \u201cI\u2019m Starved for You\u201d, originally a stand-alone story that sets up a dystopian premise promising to teach us a lesson: \u201cWhen you surrender your civil liberties, you enter a funhouse of someone else\u2019s making.\u201d The world of the tale is the product of a devastating financial crash (think 2008, only bigger) in which \u201cthe whole card castle, the whole system fell to pieces, trillions of dollars wiped off the balance sheets like fog on a window.\u201d No one\u2019s sure who to blame, but formerly middle-class couples like protagonists Stan and Charmaine are left unemployed, homeless, and on the run from roving gangs of criminals. While Charmaine earns minimum wage at the bar PixelDust, ever on the verge of resorting to prostitution, her husband Stan sulks, grudgingly relying on his ex-con younger brother Con (yes, really) for financial help.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/23/the-heart-goes-last-margaret-atwood-review-novel\">The Heart Goes Last by Margaret Atwood review \u2013 rewardingly strange</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The solution? The Positron Project, a purportedly utopian community so obviously sinister it\u2019s introduced in the form of a faux-1950s advertisement, complete with rhetorical questions (\u201cLiving in your car?\u201d \u201cRemember what your life used to be like?\u201d) and a too-good-to-be-true product (\u201cHelp solve the nation\u2019s problems of joblessness and crime while solving your own!\u201d). Positron\u2019s society combines the principle of vacation timeshares with the Stanford prison experiment. Every other month, resident couples lead middle-class lives, enjoy middle-class jobs, and live in middle-class houses in Positron\u2019s private town, Consilience. In the off months, they stay in Positron Prison, performing unpaid labor and making room in Consilience for their Alternates\u2014the couples who live their middle-class lives when they\u2019re in prison.</p> <p>Widespread demand for a continuation on the theme led Atwood to produce three succeeding parts, \u201cChoke Collar,\u201d \u201cErase Me,\u201d and \u201cThe Heart Goes Last.\u201d A scheduled fifth and final part, \u201cMoppet Shop,\u201d was never released in serial form. Atwood fans eager to read the conclusion of the Positron series were instead encouraged to buy The Heart Goes Last, which collects revised versions of the first four parts and provides a resolution. A lone question on the Goodreads page for \u201cMoppet Shop\u201d gives voice to paying subscribers \u201ccheated\u201d by the bait and switch; \u201cI just want the last episode,\u201d pleads the user. To which we might reply: Be careful what you wish for.</p> <p>Escalating suddenly into a feverish cacophony of nonsensical plot twists the New Republic called \u201ctriumphantly camp,\u201d the final chapters of The Heart Goes Last can hardly be the resolution fans were hoping for. Reviewers <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/30/books/review-margaret-atwoods-the-heart-goes-last-conjures-a-kinky-dystopia.html?_r=0\">like the New York Times\u2019 Sarah Lyall</a> have dismissed the novel\u2019s unevenness on the grounds that it began as serial fiction; Atwood herself has spoken about the \u201cpsychological pressure\u201d of serial writing, which \u201cyou can\u2019t go back and change.\u201d But one might instead question why Atwood, given the opportunity to reconcile some of the story\u2019s choicer leaps and implausibilities in a novel version marketed as revised, didn\u2019t \u201cgo back and change\u201d more. Instead, Atwood allows the conventions of pulp fiction to dominate the novel\u2019s second half, complete with a downhill slide into plot-driven story and a resolution that fulfills precisely those escapist power fantasies that the rest of the novel painstakingly denies.</p> <p>All of this might come as a surprise for longtime fans of Atwood, who has staked a certain reputation on her disavowal of \u201cscience fiction.\u201d Atwood\u2019s relationship to the term itself is an old story among fans of the genre. In the distant past of 1985, Atwood was a science fiction icon, revered by fans for her novel The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and the oppressive patriarchal religious dystopia it depicted. That reverence only grew with the 2003 publication of Oryx and Crake, the first in a trilogy of dystopian novels. But as Atwood once explained <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/28/margaret-atwood-interview\">in an interview with the Guardian</a>: \u201cI don\u2019t like being an icon. It invites iconoclasm.\u201d</p> <p>Cue the shot heard round the genre \u2014 Atwood\u2019s appalling claim on BBC Breakfast that science fiction is no more than \u201ctalking squids in outer space,\u201d a betrayal viewed by fans as second only to the 1986 SNL skit in which William Shatner told a convention\u2019s worth of Trekkies to \u201cget a life!\u201d Atwood\u2019s attempts at damage control channeled the resulting outrage into a question of semantics \u2014 the difference between \u201cscience fiction\u201d, which \u201chas monsters and spaceships\u201d and \u201cspeculative fiction\u201d, which \u201ccould really happen\u201d.</p> <p>Perhaps Atwood was attempting to align herself with the \u201cmundane SF\u201d movement, a group of writers who vowed in their 2004 manifesto to produce a \u201cno interstellar travel, no Martians\u201d brand of science fiction. But her choice of term \u2014 \u201cspeculative fiction,\u201d a charged phrase historically used by science fiction avant-gardists to elevate their plausible, \u201cserious\u201d science fiction above what they considered trashy space-opera pulps \u2014 only engendered further controversy.</p> <p>Enter science fiction\u2019s saviour, Ursula Le Guin, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/29/margaret-atwood-year-of-flood\">in a 2009 review of Atwood\u2019s The Year of the Flood</a> criticised Atwood\u2019s \u201carbitrarily restrictive definition\u201d and laid bare Atwood\u2019s motivations for proposing it: \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want the literary bigots to shove her into the literary ghetto.\u201d This literary bigotry is more than just rhetoric; the very first line of the New York Times review of Oryx and Crake, for instance, proudly declares that \u201cscience fiction will never be Literature with a capital \u2018L.\u2019\u201d While sympathizing with Atwood\u2019s motivations, Le Guin refused to endorse Atwood\u2019s proposed solution.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ada57108358c0ecc75791826675f632a8cbdf0aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ada57108358c0ecc75791826675f632a8cbdf0aa/486_222_2072_1243/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ursula Le Guin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ursula Le Guin: \u2018[Atwood] doesn\u2019t want the literary bigots to shove her into the literary ghetto.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Tuffs/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the eyes of science fiction fans, the still-raging Atwood\u2013Le Guin debate carries life-or-death stakes for the genre. The widespread acceptance of the term \u201cspeculative fiction,\u201d as Atwood has defined it, would spell the end for continuing efforts to legitimize science fiction as a genre. The resulting schism, presented as a defensive measure to protect works from the \u201cliterary bigots,\u201d would plunder genre-transcendent texts like The Handmaid\u2019s Tale to fill the snobbish stables of \u201cspeculative fiction\u201d and leave \u201cscience fiction\u201d to describe only much-derided 50s pulp novels.</p> <p>With The Heart Goes Last, however, advocates of science fiction can put down their torches and bat\u2019leths: the novel proves that speculative fiction can be every bit as pulpy as science fiction \u2014 even without the aid of \u201ctalking squids in outer space.\u201d Whether it is entirely successful is another matter.</p> <p></p> <p>Despite its efforts to the contrary, The Heart Goes Last becomes an escapist power fantasy \u2014 a persistent trope in pulp fiction parodied frequently at the novel\u2019s beginning. We\u2019re introduced to Stan first and foremost as a sexually frustrated man, emasculated by his own unemployment and lack of sexual appeal. Stan fantasizes incessantly about having total sexual control over Charmaine \u2014 not \u201cthe sex that Charmaine enacts, like yoga, with careful breath control,\u201d but \u201csex that can\u2019t be helped. No no no, yes yes yes! That\u2019s what he wants.\u201d For most of the novel, Stan is tied to disinterested female partners whose dominance is incompatible with Stan\u2019s neurotic desires.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2015/oct/02/margaret-atwood-heart-goes-last-podcast\">Margaret Atwood on The Heart Goes Last \u2013 books podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The final section of the novel, however, relies on a technological deus ex machina to stage a disturbing and implausible ending completely at odds with the novel\u2019s insistence on depicting a world that denies everyone their fantasies. The novel\u2019s conclusion resembles a 19th-century Dickensian denouement, or a kinky bastardisation of a certain Shakespeare play about mismatched lovers that appropriately appears in The Heart Goes Last in the form of an all-male burlesque show, A Midsummer Night\u2019s Scream.</p> <p>While it begins with a recognisably Atwoodian dystopian premise, The Heart Goes Last becomes mired in the territory of pulp fiction \u2014 precisely the type of work from which speculative fiction tries to differentiate itself \u2014 and concludes with events that undermine the narrative and thematic work done by the rest of the novel. The Heart Goes Last\u2019s disintegration into pulp fiction might be dismissed as a fluke, celebrated as Atwood embracing the pulp tradition, or interpreted as Atwood\u2019s send-up of that tradition. But as the latest volley in a debate between Atwood and Le Guin about the definitions of speculative fiction and science fiction, the novel\u2019s concession to pulp conventions undermines Atwood\u2019s larger claim that the genre of speculative fiction is the antithesis of those cheesy, teenage male escapist fantasies about talking squids in outer space that are pulp novels. For fans hoping to rehabilitate \u201cscience fiction\u201d as a genre designation rather than abandon it, The Heart Goes Last kindles hope that Atwood\u2019s \u201cspeculative fiction\u201d may soon collapse under the weight of its own contradictions.</p> <p>*****</p> <p><em><strong>Cecilia Mancuso</strong> is a PhD student in English at Harvard University.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.alcatrazhistory.com/stroud.htm\">Robert Stroud</a>, also known as the Birdman of Alcatraz, served 54 years in prison, 42 of them segregated from fellow inmates, before his death in 1963. His fame came not from shooting a bartender in 1909 to avenge a prostitute whom he pimped, nor from fatally stabbing a guard in 1916 while serving his manslaughter sentence at the Leavenworth, Kansas, penitentiary. (He was nearly hanged for the second homicide, but his mother petitioned President Woodrow Wilson, who commuted his sentence to life in prison.) Rather, Stroud is remembered for his unusual devotion to the birds he caught or bought and cared for while in prison.</p> <p>Next month, Christie\u2019s will auction Stroud\u2019s copy of the Atlas of Avian Anatomy (1943), enhanced by a hand-drawn checkerboard on the book\u2019s rear endpapers, at its annual <a href=\"http://www.christies.com/salelanding/index.aspx?intSaleID=26783\">Out of the Ordinary</a> sale in South Kensington, London. The auction estimate is between \u00a33,000 and \u00a35,000 ($4,000 and $6,600).</p> <p>\u201cThis is not simply a book, but a chessboard that was both hand-drawn and used by one of the world\u2019s most infamous inmates of Alcatraz, so the value is in the object\u2019s uniqueness,\u201d said Celia Harvey of Christie\u2019s. </p> <p>Famously portrayed by Burt Lancaster in the 1962 film <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055798/reference\">Birdman of Alcatraz</a>, Stroud was depicted as meticulous and kind-hearted in his care for canaries. His collection of feathered friends began in 1920, when he rehabilitated three injured sparrows that he found in the prison yard. Over the years, Stroud raised hundreds of birds, becoming an expert in avian pathology and even developing a remedy for the septicemia that ravaged his aviary. He published a full monograph on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Diseases-Canaries-Robert-Stroud/dp/1406795399\">Diseases of Canaries</a> in 1933, and a more extensive, updated edition, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Strouds-Digest-Diseases-Robert-Stroud/dp/0866227318\">Stroud\u2019s Digest on the Diseases of Birds</a>, 10 years later. </p> <p>The Birdman of Alcatraz nickname is a bit of a misnomer. Stroud was originally a prisoner at Leavenworth, and it was there that he bred birds in his cell for more than 20 years; his unexpected 1942 transfer to the infamous island lockup in San Francisco Bay actually put an end to it. But his interest in ornithology never waned, as the Atlas on offer makes clear.</p> <p>The auction lot, with its penciled-in grid of squares, also reveals another of Stroud\u2019s hobbies: chess. Several biographers and Alcatraz historians have noted that, even while confined to isolation in the prison\u2019s D-block, the prisoner was sometimes allowed to pass the time with cards and chess. According to Adam Fortunate Eagle, author of <a href=\"http://www.oupress.com/ECommerce/Book/Detail/503/heart%20of%20the%20rock\">Heart of the Rock: the Indian Invasion of Alcatraz</a>, Stroud became a serious player, and even taught other inmates how to play. </p> <p>One former Alcatraz guard, George DeVincenzi, who celebrated his 90th birthday last month at a reception at the Rock, worked at the prison from 1950 to 1958 and knew Stroud well. For one six-month stint, he supervised Stroud\u2019s weekly bath. Over the course of about a year and a half, DeVincenzi occupied two or three late nights per week by challenging the convict to a sociable game or two. \u201cI am not proud to admit this,\u201d he writes in his 2014 book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Murders-Alcatraz-George-DeVincenzi/dp/0692202285\">Murders on Alcatraz</a>, \u201cbut I used to play checkers with him on the 12-to-eight morning shift occasionally. The only time I would do this was if I knew the gun gallery officer, who could look through a peephole to make sure I was safe.\u201d</p> <p>DeVincenzi told the Guardian in a recent interview that he wasn\u2019t scared because there were two barriers between them. And, he recalled of their matches, they played on a proper gameboard. DeVincenzi, who still volunteers at the defunct jail, added: \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever beat him!\u201d</p> <p>Stroud spent many of his years at Alcatraz in the hospital ward, and in 1959, he was relocated to the US medical center for federal prisoners in Springfield, Missouri. He brought with him two manuscripts, a memoir called Bobbie, and a book about the penal system titled <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2014/01/30/birdman-of-alcatraz-robert-stroud/5054535/\">Looking Outward</a>; the latter was finally published after much legal wrangling in 2014.</p> <p>Inscribed \u201cProperty of Robert Stroud,\u201d the Atlas that now heads to auction was last sold on 13 June 1996 at PBA galleries in San Francisco, as part of a larger archive of materials that belonged to the Birdman. According to PBA, the hammer price for that lot was $12,000.</p> <p>The altered book/makeshift checkerboard, complete with plastic chess pieces, is presently owned by the omnivorous Jersey-based collector David Gainsborough Roberts, whose extraordinary possessions, including Queen Victoria\u2019s embroidered drawers, Napoleon\u2019s leather wallet and John Wayne\u2019s cream-colored Stetson, will be offered alongside the Alcatraz relic. As Celia Harveys put it: \u201cAll the pieces in this eclectic selection have a story to tell.\u201d</p> <p><em>Items from the Out of the Ordinary sale are on exhibit at Christie\u2019s South Kensington, London until the evening of the auction, 14 September. </em></p>",
  "<p>\u201cAssumption is the mother of all cock-ups. We can\u2019t assume that it will be a golden ticket,\u201d says Jimmy Fairhurst of Not Too Tame about the return of the company\u2019s 2014 word-of-mouth hit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/01/edinburgh-festival-2014-review-early-doors\">Early Doors</a> to the Edinburgh festival this summer. Performed in a real pub, it\u2019s a lovely, unassuming show and has been a deserved success on tour. This year, the company are also bringing a new show, <a href=\"https://www.pleasance.co.uk/event/electric-eden#overview\">Electric Eden</a>, to the fringe. Like Early Doors, it\u2019s a piece of popular theatre that gives ordinary people a voice. \u201cWe make theatre for people who think theatre might be too polite for them,\u201d says Fairhurst. \u201cLike <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/jan/03/pete-postlethwaite-obituary\">Pete Postlethwaite</a> said about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/mar/04/everyman-theatre-liverpool-rebuild-opens\">Everyman</a>: \u2018We\u2019re cheap but we\u2019re not shoddy.\u2019\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a12f69b6ede742520dea4d84a4e9ae7cfbe7ccce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a12f69b6ede742520dea4d84a4e9ae7cfbe7ccce/308_0_2463_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Not Too Tame\u2019s new show Electric Eden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"947\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spread the risk \u2026 Not Too Tame\u2019s new show Electric Eden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.nottootame.com/\">Not Too Tame</a> are hoping to cross-fertilise their audience, to use the return of a proven hit as a cushion to help spread the risk of Electric Eden. But Fairhurst is right to be wary of assuming that Early Doors is a certain banker for them. The fringe can be a fickle place. Just because something is a hit one year doesn\u2019t guarantee that it will capture punters\u2019 imaginations and wallets next time round. </p> <p>The days when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/jun/27/artsfeatures\">Hull Truck</a>\u2019s production of Bouncers  was a dead cert for the company year in and year out are long gone. Today\u2019s fringe is massively bigger and more competitive, and offers audiences way more choice. The new is often prized far more than the tried and tested. When a show returns a second or third time to the festival, it is unlikely to attract the same interest from the press and bloggers or to attract the attention of awards committees.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We hold our breath every year at that moment we check advance sales in July, and go: 'That's not looking great'</p> <footer> <cite>James Grieve, Paines Plough</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of course there are shows that are successful year after year: the Iranian sleeper hit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jun/21/nassim-soleimanpour-play-censorship\">White Rabbit, Red Rabbit</a> returns to Edinburgh for the fifth time this summer, but the format of the play \u2013 in which a performer is given the script sight unseen \u2013 means that it\u2019s different every time.

We hold our breath every year at that moment at the end of July when we look at the advance sales figures, and we always go: \u2018Wow, that\u2019s not looking great.\u2019 But Edinburgh audiences book very late, and our guiding principle is that we will bring something back if we think there is still an audience for it. During the second half of the run last year there were huge queues for returns for Every Brilliant Thing every single day and as long as we think there\u2019s an audience for it we should do it, not least because we are really proud of it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d412ffb84ab64fcf38fd65a5741a3933dde83eee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d412ffb84ab64fcf38fd65a5741a3933dde83eee/0_0_3909_2601/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonny Donahoe performs the interactive comedy show with Every Brilliant Thing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonny Donahoe performs the interactive comedy show with Every Brilliant Thing</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s another reason too. Like many companies, Paines Plough work within a mixed economy. A show such as Every Brilliant Thing can provide the financial return needed to support new work in Roundabout. This year\u2019s Roundabout lineup includes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/15/lemons-lemons-lemons-lemons-lemons-review-edinburgh-festival-southside-walrus-theatre\">Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons</a>, Sam Steiner\u2019s debut play about a world in which the government limits citizens to 140 words per day. That show had audiences queuing for returns at Zoo Southside last year. Putting it in Roundabout not only allows a far greater number of people to see it, but is also an affirmation of faith in a writer and company who Grieve describes as \u201cso young they really have no right to be so accomplished\u201d. He hopes it will help pull a younger audience into Roundabout.</p> <p>\u201cOne of our jobs at Paines Plough is to find and nurture the people who will write the Every Brilliant Things of the future,\u201d says Grieve. \u201cWe reckon Sam Steiner could be one of those people, and so by bringing Lemons back in a bigger space, we\u2019re supporting that.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Companies must budget for not filling all seats in the first week, then may not fulfil demand later if they're a hit</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Last year, <a href=\"http://www.worklighttheatre.co.uk/shows/labels/\">Joe Sellman-Leava of Worklight</a>  won a <a href=\"https://www.edfringe.com/participants/promoting-your-show/awards#ScotFringeFirst\">Fringe First award</a> at the end of week two for his show <a href=\"https://www.pleasance.co.uk/event/labels-0#overview\">Labels</a>, a quietly impressive one-man show about his experience of prejudice while growing up and the casual racism that he and his family encounter on a daily basis. Labels had a 55-seater space in the Pleasance where it played to 68% capacity, regularly selling out towards the end of the run. One of the problems in Edinburgh is that companies have to budget for the fact that they are unlikely to fill all seats in the first week or so of the festival, but if the show captures the public imagination they can\u2019t fulfil demand later because of the limited run in a limited capacity space. Bringing a show back is a way of trying to capitalise on that past success.</p> <p>This year Labels will be in Pleasance Beside, which has 80 seats to fill. Sellman-Leava knows he\u2019s taking a risk, but it\u2019s one he is going into with his eyes wide open. He has worked on the show since last year and feels it\u2019s stronger. Being back in Edinburgh helps keep Worklight\u2019s name alive on the fringe (with audiences as well as those crucial venue programmers) until they can return with a new show next year. The company is also putting more money into the marketing and advertising budget to spread the word. As Sellman-Leava says, in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/30/police-report-fivefold-increase-race-hate-crimes-since-brexit-result\">post-Brexit climate in which hate crimes are rising</a>  Labels is \u201cmore relevant than ever\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83f8878c63a5e021893fe3f3e6e9cbfec5647692\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83f8878c63a5e021893fe3f3e6e9cbfec5647692/0_111_2677_1879/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Vaudevillians by Les Enfants Terribles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"702\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Atmospheric \u2026 The Vaudevillians by Les Enfants Terribles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Hobson/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But judging when the fringe has already had too much of a good thing can be a real skill too.

They returned with that show the following year, and Les Enfants\u2019 James Seager says it was useful because it allowed them to \u201cchange it and improve it\u201d. But even though the Pleasance was eager for the company to bring the show back again in 2014, Seager demurred. \u201cOf course we were tempted but I really thought it might be overkill. It\u2019s better to leave people wanting more.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The normal route is for a TV show to build an audience and then launch an app as they\u2019ve been told it extends their \u201cengagement\u201d. Shazam, the music recognition app, could have just flipped that thinking to become the first app to be made into a TV show. </p> <p>Beat Shazam has been picked up by Fox in the US where it will be produced by British executive Mark Brunett, and is basically a modern spin on Name That Tune, where contestants play against the music identification app to try and identify a song first. It has been a long and curious journey for Shazam but, unlike many of its peers, it is still going after 15 years, which is several lifetimes in digital music. </p> <p>Back in 2001, the only real use for your Nokia 3310, beyond calling and texting people, was playing Snake. That January, I got a demo of an early version of Shazam at Midem, the annual music industry conference in Cannes, where the developers held up their handset in a crowded bar as music played over the PA and, five seconds later, an SMS arrived telling us what the song was and who was singing it. It worked on proprietary acoustic fingerprinting technology and remains the most jaw-dropping deployment of nascent software I have ever experienced. It felt like magic. </p> <p>When it fully launched in 2002 in the UK initially, Shazam had to rely on the 2580 short code to work (deliberately picked as the numbers made up the middle row of a handset\u2019s keypad and therefore would be easy to remember); but then you\u2019d have to go to an actual shop and buy the CD as iTunes did not exist then. Some experimentation with mobile operators\u2019 portals followed, where you could download tracks straight to your phone but that was the first real white elephant of digital music retail as \u201cmobile content\u201d then was ostensibly polyphonic ringtones and few handsets could handle MP3s.</p> <p>Shazam\u2019s spotlight moment, however, arrived in 2008 with the debut of the Apple app store and it featured as one of the early apps in Apple\u2019s marketing around both the store and the iPhone. Just as bands having a track used in iPod ads a few years earlier found, being associated with an Apple product could catapult you from the margins and into the mainstream. By the end of 2014, Shazam had reached 120 million monthly users and was dealing with 20 million tags a day. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4822ecafa450753875898e6ff7fcb704abf4ad58\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4822ecafa450753875898e6ff7fcb704abf4ad58/0_140_1440_1800/800.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Barton, founder of Shazam, and a very old cellphone.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Barton, founder of Shazam, and a very old cellphone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Baron/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There have been multiple competitors that came in its wake \u2013 notably SoundHound and Sony\u2019s own TrackID \u2013 but they have been overshadowed by Shazam\u2019s enormous user base (it has more than 100 million monthly users). </p> <p>The post-iPhone business model then was relatively straightforward. The app was free to use but users could link through to buy identified tracks from iTunes \u2013 and later other retailers as it developed apps for every major mobile operating system \u2013 with Shazam taking an affiliate cut of every download. At its peak, the company was reporting that around 10% of tagged tracks resulted in a purchase. (There was also a paid version of the app that allowed unlimited tagging and extra functionality, but the company soon realised it had to be free at the point of initial use to get on to as many smartphones as possible \u2013 500 million and counting.)</p> <p>That was to prove a short-lived gold rush as the download market started to decline, first in the US in 2013, and now Shazam, in a telling indication of the changing of the guard, links through to streaming services like Apple Music, Deezer and Napster.</p> <p>It remains an important marketing platform for the record industry, where acts and labels promote tracks in-app and ensure that as soon as pre-release tracks go to DJs, Shazam has it in its database in advance. I was once told, off the record, how one major label was sent into a flap after scoring a sync on a major ad campaign but had forgotten to send the track to Shazam and had to panic-mail the file over so that Shazam could ingest it and ensure there were no more failed tags. Shazam, at that point, was seen by labels as a second wind in marketing a track after it was used in an advert. </p> <p>Fifteen years is a long time in technology and Shazam has had to evolve beyond music identification, developing trending charts and also working with TV/film companies, brands and advertisers (where posters are \u201cShazamable\u201d) to extend it beyond just music. It has been involved with the Super Bowl ad break as well as American Idol, plus it has evolved its technology to let users \u201ctag\u201d TV shows. It has been a part of the background of shows, but Fox is hoping its brand is known and powerful enough to be parlayed into a show in its own right. </p> <p>Shazam is also proof that, even with scale, it does not follow that digital companies become profitable. The company may have raised $30m of new investment at the start of 2015 to give it a market valuation of $1bn, but it is still losing money. For example, in 2014, it ran up losses of \u00a314.8m ($19.3m) according to its filings at Companies House in the UK. It is not alone in this regard, with both Pandora and Spotify currently grappling with this exact scale/profitability conundrum. </p> <p>In many ways, the Beat Shazam TV show sees it returning to its music roots. Like Hoover and Google, Shazam is that rare instance where a proper noun becomes a verb \u2013 but that can only carry you so far in terms of building a viable business. Contestants on the show stand to win \u201cbig money prizes\u201d and Shazam itself is no doubt crossing its fingers for a similar windfall. </p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 12 August to clarify that Chris Barton is the founder of Shazam and not it\u2019s current CEO, that position is held by Rich Riley.</li> </ul>",

It was the first time I\u2019d met him, and in front of my new team including my new manager he said: \u2018I\u2019m sure the audience would be much happier if you were presenting the prize instead. I was naive enough not to know what he was implying, so I asked [and he replied]: \u2018You\u2019re a slim young woman, I\u2019m sure they\u2019d much rather look at that than me.\u2019</p> <p>After I\u2019d been there about six months, my head of department mentioned that the powers that be were getting ticked off with the director\u2019s behaviour and that apparently he\u2019d been making inappropriate comments to other women. I explained that he said inappropriate things to me all the time, and then I rattled off some of the things he\u2019d said to me about my appearance, age, and clothes just that week. But she didn\u2019t seem phased. She just said \u201cnot good, is it?\u201d and then repeated her comment that I should tell her if he said anything inappropriate. But I just had and it had fallen on deaf ears. I knew my complaints weren\u2019t welcome, like it was just a bit of office gossip to get involved with and not something to take seriously. </p> <p>I felt really demeaned working there. It\u2019s one thing having to be in a situation with someone who thinks that sort of behaviour is okay, but when you\u2019ve reported it and it\u2019s even been witnessed by your entire team and your manager, and yet it\u2019s brushed under the carpet, it makes you feel like everyone is against you and that actually you\u2019re the one with the problem. It built an anxiety every time I had to interact with the director. I\u2019d be second guessing what he might say and how I\u2019d respond in a way that wouldn\u2019t turn round on me. In the end, I started being rude towards the director, and would openly say I didn\u2019t like him and didn\u2019t want to work with him which everyone just sort of accepted and if anything found funny. It bothered me though that I had to become unprofessional in order to protect myself. That\u2019s not who I want to be and I\u2019m sure other managers in the organisation would have seen me as someone quite aggressive and inflexible, when actually that\u2019s not who I am or want to be at all.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Holly, 26, public relations officer, Scotland</strong></p> <h2>\u2018I felt very uncomfortable working side by side with him after that\u2019</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I had my first job at 17 in a shop, and was very shy and introverted. One of the male staff members seemed especially friendly, so we exchanged polite small talk now and then.</p> <p>Then one day we had to pair off to do the inventory. Once everyone else was out of earshot and we were in a secluded corner of the shop, he started making comments like: \u2018If you like animals why don\u2019t you like me?\u2019 while stacking toys.

He knew we would never interact outside of work and used this as an opportunity to get me on my own, make me feel vulnerable, touch me inappropriately and pretend it was part of his job.

I also know for a fact that a female apprentice was forced out of the company when she announced that she was pregnant, but they made it look like she was incompetent. </p> <p>I didn\u2019t tell anyone about it, until I got progressively more depressed.

  "<h2>1. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3gEQlmp290\">The Sahara All Stars \u2013 Take Your Soul</a></h2> <p>With Nigeria being the most populous country in Africa (not to mention the seventh in the world) and Lagos being a truly international city, it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that so many dancefloor-orientated genres \u2013 Afrobeat, Afrofunk and Afrodisco \u2013 flourished there in the 1970s and 80s. Despite its bloody colonial history (the country became independent from British rule in 1960) and terrible dictatorships after 1970, there was still rich cultural exchange between Nigeria and the UK. One of the country\u2019s most celebrated sons, Fela Kuti, learned his chops playing in London jazz clubs in the mid-60s. Likewise, heavyweight British musicians such as Ginger Baker and Paul McCartney fell in love with the musical culture of the west African nation, and for good reason: Nigeria is internationally famed for its adoption of highlife and its homegrown Afrobeat. But the creative club scene and cultural preference for live music over DJs meant local disco bands tended to be in demand. Every town had at least one world-class band, and this bunch of talented all-rounders were from Jos, in the middle belt of the country. The Sahara All Stars were as happy playing reggae as they were jamming out long Afrobeat numbers and cutting crisp disco funk tracks, as Take Your Soul shows. Their second album, Sahara All Stars of Jos, came out in 1976 on Nigeria EMI, but for those who don\u2019t fancy paying ridiculous prices, it is available on the essential Soundway compilation <a href=\"https://www.soundwayrecords.com/Shop/DownloadDetails?rid=SWR_RE_50\">Nigeria Disco Funk Special: The Sound of the Underground Lagos Dancefloor 1974-79</a>.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/BoilerRoom/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Boiler Room logo\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/BoilerRoom/embed.html\">Boiler Room logo</a> </figure>  <h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBxBvlGes34\">Joni Haastrup \u2013 Greetings</a></h2> <p>Joni Haastrup was born in Sierra Leone, but he grew up among Nigerian royalty and made his name \u2013 to a certain extent at least \u2013 on the dancefloors of his adopted country. The qualifier is necessary, because despite being one of the most important musicians involved in the country\u2019s highlife, rock, Afrobeat and disco scenes, he has remained relatively unknown. Perhaps it is understandable given that he recorded under a bewildering number of aliases and spent a lot of his career collaborating with other musicians and playing second fiddle in their bands. He was a member of the Ginger Baker groups Salt and Air Force; he provided the vocals on the first ever Afrobeat album, Orlando Julius\u2019s Super Afro Soul, and he worked with Fela Kuti on other crucial releases. However, despite his own recordings being reissued, including the killer 1978 album <a href=\"http://hotcasarecords.com/release/joni-haastrup/\">Wake Up Your Mind</a>, his music has not gripped the UK Afro record-buying public\u2019s attention in the same way as Fela or, more recently, William Onyeabor have. Perhaps that will change. He features heavily on an excellent new soul jazz compilation Nigeria Soul Fever: Afrofunk, Disco And Boogie: West African Disco Mayhem! which is due out later this month. And this killer slo-mo disco track from 1978 also features on the indispensable introductory compilation <a href=\"http://www.strut-records.com/nigeria-70-definitive-lp-edition/\">Nigeria 70 \u2013 Funky Lagos</a>.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/aug/09/how-nigerian-artists-made-their-mark-on-british-music\">How Nigerian artists made their mark on British music</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>3. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPAZ87a_oE\">Orlando Julius \u2013 Disco Hi-Life</a></h2> <p>It just doesn\u2019t get much better than this. Orlando Julius came from Nigeria and had a solid grounding in many African musical styles and cultures, but he was also a true internationalist. He was a regular collaborator with the Detroit soul powerhouse Lamont Dozier, for example, and this adaptability left him well positioned to pull off this exquisitely balanced hybrid of languid disco and serotonin-drenched highlife in 1979. This unbeatably upbeat and sun-dappled floorfiller has undergone something of a revival over recent years (and deservedly so) after <a href=\"http://hotcasarecords.com/release/orlando-julius-disco-hi-life/\">Hot Casa reissued the EP</a> in 2014. Orlando remains a prodigiously talented musician, as his recent album <a href=\"https://orlandojulius.bandcamp.com/album/jaiyede-afro\">Jaiyede Afro</a>, recorded with London based spiritual jazz/Afro funk orchestra the Heliocentrics proves. <br></p> <h2>4. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2laU08Ca5U\">Mixed Grill \u2013 A Brand New Wayo</a></h2> <p>I fail to see how anything that mixes Afrobeat, disco, reggae, funk and a selection of tasty grilled meats could be anything other than fantastic, and this record genuinely is amazing. Recorded in Lagos but mixed and mastered at Abbey Road, with an international release on Decca, Mixed Grill\u2019s 1979 album A Cry for Peace and Love was obviously made with one eye on crossover potential. But even if they were aiming at an American audience, you can\u2019t mistake where those drums come from. According to the sleevenotes, the keyboards on this LP were played by Lemmy. One would presume it\u2019s not the same one. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/aug/08/gateways-tony-allen-and-nigeria-from-afrobeat-to-afrobeats\">Gateways \u2013 Tony Allen and Nigeria: From Afrobeat to Afrobeats</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>5. <a href=\"https://soundsoftheuniverse.com/sjr/product/nigeria-soul-fever\">Arakatula \u2013 Wake Up Africa</a></h2> <p>In Nigeria, it has always been hard to ignore the heavily politicised and radical overtones that suffuse popular dance music. After suffering a terrible civil war that killed three million people in three years, and a police state giving way to a military dictatorship, working-class and middle-class Nigerians were not just worn out after the 1970 coup but also bitterly angry that they were seeing no benefits whatsoever from the discovery of huge oilfields or their country\u2019s membership of Opec. The gulf between the rich and poor could not have been wider. And it was in this atmosphere that the charismatic and rich-voiced Arakatula released the low-slung, agitated prop disco banger Wake Up Africa in 1979 \u2013 it features on the forthcoming soul jazz compilation Nigerian Soul Fever. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Nigerian disco\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3Aguardianmusic%3Aplaylist%3A3AR0lybjcXyeoJCVd1pON6\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>6. <a href=\"https://soundsoftheuniverse.com/sjr/product/tee-mac-2-night-illusion\">Tee Mac \u2013 Hit Hit</a></h2> <p>Tee Mac Omatshola Iseli lived an unusual life by any standards. Born into Nigerian royalty in 1948, he was packed off to Zurich at an early age after his father \u2013 a successful businessman and diplomat \u2013 was assassinated at work. However traumatic it was, the move would prove fruitful for Tee Mac because it brought him under the influence and tutelage of Jean-Pierre Rampal, a brilliant and internationally respected flautist. After 14 years studying the instrument, the 22-year-old Tee Mac returned to Lagos, where he formed a series of heavyweight psychedelic Afro-rock bands including Tee Mac and Afro Collection and the amazingly named Tee Mac and the Backing Band. The former outfit featured Berkley Jones on lead guitar, Joni Haastrup on keyboards, Friday Puzzo on congas and for a short time, Ginger Baker on drums, before Baker absconded with all the musicians bar Tee Mac to form his own group, Salt. The flute-playing prodigy wasn\u2019t fazed and recorded an 18m-selling single called Fly Robin Fly under the pseudonym Levay, which set him up financially for life. He then served a stint as Shirley Bassey\u2019s arranger and bandleader before relaunching himself as a disco musician with the Party Fever LP in 1976. Keeping abreast of dancefloor fashions, he adopted a slick boogie style for 1980\u2019s stunning Hit Hit \u2013 which clearly would have been as suitable for Manhattan\u2019s Studio 54 as it was in his own Black Pussycat club in Yaba. As much as Tee Mac was a great band leader and flautist, his real secret weapon in the Nigerian boogie period was his powerhouse lead vocalist, Marjorie Bares, who carries this track effortlessly across a heaving, underlit dancefloor. Tee Mac remains a successful businessman and one of the most in-demand and highly paid flautists in the world. Hit Hit is taken from the album Night Illusion, which is <a href=\"https://soundsoftheuniverse.com/sjr/product/tee-mac-2-night-illusion\">reissued by Soul Jazz on 16 September</a>.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/05/tony-allen-fela-was-right-but-i-detest-singing-militant\">Tony Allen: \u2018Fela was right \u2013 but I detest singing militant\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>7. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGNIHKIhCZ8\">Eno Louis - Hot Love</a></h2> <p>Eno Louis was a resident member of Fela Kuti\u2019s Republic of Kalakuta compound until a notoriously vicious army attack in 1977 caused him to flee to America. Confusingly, he didn\u2019t record his highly collectible Living in USA album until 1982, when he was back in Nigeria. The track Move! features his early experiments with the emergent rap scene, but Hot Love showcases his more disco boogie-leaning sensibilities. <br></p> <h2>8. Odion Iruoje \u2013 Identify With Your Root (Which One You De?)</h2> <p>The self-styled \u201csound president\u201d teamed up with Akika Omodele in 1983 to write the lyrics for this roots-conscious piece of disco-rap, directed at the African global diaspora. This glorious slice of ultra freshness spreads a positive message to African men and women the world over via rhyme schemes that paint Iruoje as the Nigerian Funky 4 + 1 or Sugarhill Gang. Except it should be pointed out that there can\u2019t be too many old school US rap jams featuring a masterly, lengthy <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_drum\">talking-drum breakdown</a>.

He was lionised \u2013 along with Klaus Dinger of Neu! and Clyde Stubblefield of James Brown\u2019s band \u2013 by Brian Eno for inventing one of the three most important drum beats of the late 20th century. Fela claimed Allen\u2019s ability to play four separate rhythms simultaneously made him feel like he had a quartet of drummers in his band rather than just one. Whether this 1984 Afro dancefloor staple \u2013 one of Allen\u2019s many solo outings \u2013 is strictly disco is open to debate, but the gloriously insistent locked groove and propulsive electronic elements necessitate its inclusion.<br></p> <h2>10. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fnTxm1u_34\">William Onyeabor \u2013 When the Going Is Smooth &amp; Good </a></h2> <p>Despite a recent, long-overdue reissue project courtesy of Luaka Bop, William Onyeabor remains something of an enigma. He was a bright kid and, so the legend goes, was sent to study in Moscow during the 1970s on a scholarship. In more recent years, Onyeabor he has been ennobled into Nigerian royalty, taken over a successful flour mill and become a born again Christian. The upshot is that he now refuses to discuss his earlier life as a musician. The facts about his career remain pleasingly opaque. Maybe he set himself up as a film-maker and invested the profits into banks and banks of synthesisers before setting himself up as a futuristic funk star. There again, maybe he didn\u2019t. What we can say with some certainty is that by some means or other he developed a genuinely unique sound which made him more akin to an African Devo or Cerrone than Fela Kuti or Orlando Julius. His body of work features many immensely satisfying slabs of Lagosian synth funk and pulsating new wave disco, and nearly all of it remained Afrofunk\u2019s best-kept secret for decades. Until recently, Onyeabor had steadfastly refused to allow his back catalogue to be reissued, causing prices on Discogs to eventually spiral out of control, with only a couple of tracks such as the uncontested dancefloor destroyer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k51cnVcbUAo\">Body and Soul</a> turning up regularly on officially licensed compilations. Collectors, DJs and fans had to make do with very low quality MP3s and YouTube rips until Luaka Bop wore the great man down and reissued most of his 70s and 80s material in 2013 and 2014. Good Name, Let\u2019s Fall in Love and Atomic Bomb are all electro disco gold dust, but this lesser-known 1985 track is both unusual and perfect, coming across like some hipster\u2019s torrid wish-fulfilment combination of John Bender, OMD, the Units, LCD Soundsystem and Ebo Taylor. </p>",
  "<p>It was honey that she licked to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/indian-activist-irom-chanu-sharmila-ends-16-year-hunger-strike-lick-honey\" title=\"\">break her hunger strike</a>, the world\u2019s longest, but it may not have tasted too sweet. Irom Sharmila had refused to put any food or water in her mouth every day for the past 16 years. Following the 2000 killing of 10 people in her home state of Manipur, reportedly by a government-run paramilitary group, Sharmila was calling for the repressive Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), which grants the military immunity from judicial inquiry, to be repealed. Repeatedly arrested, released and rearrested on the charge of attempted suicide in a farcical routine during her protest, Sharmila had been incarcerated in a hospital room and was being force-fed through a surgical nasal tube.</p> <p>But when the \u201ciron lady of Manipur\u201d announced she would eat and drink again, it made many well-fed people very uncomfortable. Tragically, some of her closest supporters failed to welcome her decision to end the hunger strike and enter politics instead. But why should the legitimacy of Sharmila\u2019s battle only depend on her willingness to be cast in the martyr mould? There is something deeply selfish and illogical in expecting an absolute personal sacrifice from her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ada63e49bcf1d352b7ebc99eff527a7c78326dbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ada63e49bcf1d352b7ebc99eff527a7c78326dbf/0_376_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Irom Sharmila at a press conference in Imphal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Irom Sharmila at a press conference in Imphal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anupam Nath/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the draconian law was not repealed, her hunger strike did lay bare the apathy in India both for this form of protest and for the violence the law has fuelled. Many of us who grew up in parts of India far from the north-east, and with a national media that loves to ignore the region, got to know of the AFSPA because we had heard Sharmila\u2019s story. And it has drawn attention to the law globally too. Sharmila has accomplished what no one else could, by giving a face to the protest, and a compassionate one at that.</p> <p>Her fast was an act of silent resistance. But she has spoken now. She would like to become chief minister of Manipur; if elected, she wants to repeal the AFSPA. Everyone knows this won\u2019t be easy but her fast wasn\u2019t either. State elections are due early next year. Sharmila has just about enough time to make the transition from being a peaceful protester to an active politician. By her own admission this is new terrain and no one knows whether she will succeed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sharmila\u2019s change of strategy is courageous</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To make matters worse, the misogyny among her supporters and observers, who are pitting her personal choices against her political stance, is doing her a great disservice. Her relationship with the British-Indian man she\u2019d like to marry has irked many who believe he might have \u201cmisled\u201d her into taking this decision. This kind of scrutiny takes away agency from Sharmila, who is known to have taken the decision to go on this long hunger strike on her own.</p> <p>Furthermore, two insurgent groups have allegedly sent Sharmila warnings, reminding her that those like her who \u201cforgot\u201d what they were fighting for have been assassinated in the past. But Sharmila told journalists after she broke her fast that she wants to be seen as \u201ca human being with feelings\u201d and not a \u201cgoddess\u201d. Her life is threatened in a more serious way today than it ever was before. And her new political choice is just as big a gamble as the last.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/indian-activist-irom-chanu-sharmila-ends-16-year-hunger-strike-lick-honey\">Indian activist ends 16-year hunger strike with a lick of honey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sharmila\u2019s change of strategy is courageous. She has resisted the narcissist trap of wanting to be respected and remembered for living and dying for a single oath. Rather than being dismissed as a defeat, her decision should be seen as a refusal to let herself be victimised any further, as an act of renewed resistance. During the hunger strike, she was allowed neither to die nor to live fully and her protest fell on deaf ears. She was reduced to being a comforting symbol for people she fought for and an innocuous creature for the Indian state, which paid no heed to her demand. Most activists fighting impunity are reluctant to do so from within the system. But watching her self-destruct in an egoistic folly would hardly help the cause.</p> <p>The support structure around Sharmila has always been fragile. Her mother, who once hoped to feed her just one meal, now refuses to see her until her she succeeds in getting the AFSPA repealed. Her own supporters who thrived on her sacrifice are probably struggling right now to find their new raison d\u2019\u00eatre. They know that elections in strife-ridden Manipur are fraught with complexities. Many believe a political platform such as the one Sharmila could offer, focusing primarily on the repeal of AFSPA, has no real place in Manipur politics.</p> <p>But Sharmila could provide voters with a clear choice that they have not had before, as an independent candidate, not aligned with any party. She is fighting for her people and this time she won\u2019t be alone in her struggle, as she was during her hunger strike. If people wish to empower her, the cause and themselves, they will vote for her. And if she loses, they will have to accept that they have lost too.</p>",

  "<p>Unless there is a dramatic and unlikely political upset, Jeremy Corbyn will again win the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourleadership\">Labour leadership contest</a>. It will be a victory gifted by his opponents. Last year, his triumph was dismissed as a combination of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/03/jeremy-corbyn-new-labour-centre-left\">madness, petulance and zealotry</a>. But many commentators lack any understanding or curiosity about political movements outside their comfort zone. Political analysts who scramble over one another to understand, say, the rise of Ukip have precious little interest in a similar treatment of Corbynism, abandoning scholarship for sneers. The likes of Ukip or Donald Trump or the French Front National are understood as manifestations, however unfortunate, of genuine grievances: the movements behind Bernie Sanders, Podemos and Jeremy Corbyn are dismissed as armies of the self-indulgent and the deluded.</p> <p>A few days ago, I wrote <a href=\"https://medium.com/@OwenJones84/questions-all-jeremy-corbyn-supporters-need-to-answer-b3e82ace7ed3#.jcaryx9rp\">a piece</a> about the Labour leadership\u2019s desperate need to get a handle on strategy, vision and competence, and reach beyond its comfort zone. A failure to do so could mean not just its own eventual demise, but that of Labour and the left for a generation or more. Among some, this piece provoked dismay and even fury. Yet Corbyn\u2019s victory is all but assured, and if the left wishes to govern and transform the country as well as a political party, these are questions that have to be addressed \u2013 and a leadership contest that may be swiftly followed by a potentially disastrous snap election is exactly the right time. But that is of limited comfort to Corbyn\u2019s opponents \u2013 some of whom are now dragging their own party\u2019s membership <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jul/28/court-to-rule-in-case-that-could-exclude-corbyn-from-labour-leadership-contest-politics-live\">through the courts</a>.

His leadership campaign believed it was charging at a door made of reinforced steel. It turned out to be made of paper. Corbyn\u2019s rise was facilitated by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/29/labour-abolish-electoral-college-alan-johnson\">abolition of Labour\u2019s electoral college</a> and the introduction of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/18/labour-leadership-election-fee-harriet-harman\">registered supporters scheme</a>. The biggest cheerleaders included Blairites; much of the left was opposed, <a href=\"http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-16cb-Tony-Blair-and-Lord-Owen-praise-Labour-leaders-union-link-attack#.V6e715MrKHo\">regarding it \u2013 quite legitimately \u2013 as an attempt to dilute Labour\u2019s trade union link</a>. When the reform package was introduced, Tony Blair <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jul/09/tony-blair-ed-miliband-labour-union-reform\">called it \u201cbold and strong\u201d</a>, adding that he probably \u201cshould have done it when I was leader\u201d. Two years ago, arch-Blairite columnist John Rentoul <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/ed-miliband-s-labour-party-reforms-are-good-news-for-all-9162681.html\">applauded the reforms</a>, believing they helped guarantee Ed Miliband would be succeeded by a Blairite. Whoops.</p> <p>Here was a semi-open primary in which candidates had an opportunity to enthuse the wider public: Corbyn\u2019s opponents failed to do so. The French Socialists managed to attract 2.5 million people to select their presidential candidate in 2011; a similar number voted in the Italian Democratic party\u2019s primary in 2013. In the early stages of last year\u2019s leadership contest, members of Liz Kendall\u2019s team <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article4451152.ece\">were briefing</a> that she could end up with a million votes. The hubris. The candidates preaching electability had the least traction with a wider electorate. There are many decent Labour MPs, but it is difficult to think of any with the stature of the party\u2019s past giants: Barbara Castle, Nye Bevan, Ernie Bevin, Herbert Morrison, Margaret Bondfield, Harold Wilson, Stafford Cripps, Ellen Wilkinson. Machine politics hollowed out the party, and at great long-term cost. If, last year, there had been a Labour leadership candidate with a clear shot at winning a general election, Labour members might have compromised on their beliefs: there wasn\u2019t, and so they didn\u2019t.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/aug/09/ed-miliband-labour-members-vote-owen-smith-leader-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4q6yk\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2642483\"            data-video-name=\"Ed Miliband urges Labour members to vote Owen Smith for leader \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"YouTube/ Owen 2016\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57a9e958e4b033cb0795e6c6\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/09/160809MillibandBacksSmith_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/09/160809MillibandBacksSmith.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/09/160809MillibandBacksSmith_V3.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/aug/09/ed-miliband-labour-members-vote-owen-smith-leader-video\">Ed Miliband urges Labour members to vote Owen Smith for leader</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>When a political party faces a catastrophic election defeat, a protracted period of reflection and self-criticism is normally expected. Why were we rejected, and how do we win people back? But in Labour\u2019s internal battle, there has been precious little soul-searching by the defeated. Mirroring those on the left who blame media brainwashing for the Tories\u2019 electoral victories, they simply believe they have been invaded by hordes of far-left zombies assembled by Momentum. The membership are reduced to, at best, petulant children; at worst, sinister hate-filled mobs. Some of those now mustering outrage at Corbynistas for smearing Labour critics as Tories were the same people who applied \u201cTrot\u201d as a blanket term for leftwingers in the Blair era. Although Tom Watson (no Blairite) accepts there are Momentum members \u201cdeeply interested in political change\u201d, he has raised the spectre of the shrivelled remnants of British Trotskyism <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/09/tom-watson-interview-jeremy-corbyn-labour-rifts-hug-shout\">manipulating younger members</a>; but surely he accepts they have agency and are capable of thinking for themselves? Arch critics reduce Corbynism to a personality cult, which is wrong. In any case, when Blair was leader, I recall his staunchest devotees behaving like boy-band groupies. I remember Blair\u2019s final speech to party conference \u2013 delegates produced supposedly homemade <a href=\"http://www.socialistparty.org.uk/articles/5472/28-09-2006/blairs-long-goodbye\">placards declaring</a> \u201cTB 4 eva\u201d and \u201cWe love you Tony\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What do Corbyn\u2019s staunchest opponents within Labour actually stand for?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Corbynism is assailed for having an authoritarian grip on the party, mostly because it wins victories through internal elections and court judgments: ironic, given that Blairism used to be a byword for \u201ccontrol freakery\u201d. Corbyn\u2019s harshest critics claimed superior political nous, judgment and strategy, then launched a disastrously incompetent coup in the midst of a post-Brexit national crisis, deflecting attention from the Tories, sending Labour\u2019s polling position hurtling from poor to calamitous, and provoking almost all-out war between Labour\u2019s membership and the parliamentary party: all for the sake of possibly gifting their enemy an even greater personal mandate. They denounce Corbyn\u2019s foreign associations, but have little to say about former leader Blair literally <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/23/tony-blairs-5m-deal-to-advise-kazakh-dictator/\">having been in the pay of Kazakhstan\u2019s dictator Nursultan</a> Nazarbayev, whose regime stands accused of torture and the killing of opponents. Corbyn\u2019s bitterest enemies preach the need to win over middle-class voters, then sneer at Corbynistas for being too middle class (even though, as a point of fact, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyns-supporters-are-more-working-class-than-other-candidates-research-finds-10476433.html\">polling last year</a> found that Corbyn\u2019s voters were the least middle class).

What do Corbyn\u2019s staunchest opponents within Labour actually stand for? Vision was abandoned in favour of finger-wagging about electability with no evidence to back it up. Owen Smith offers no shortage of policies: but it is last summer\u2019s political insurgency within Labour\u2019s ranks one must thank for putting them on the agenda.

The Iraq war \u2013 which took the lives of countless civilians and soldiers, plunged the region into chaos and helped spawn Islamic State \u2013 is regarded as a freakish, irrational, leftwing obsession. The left defended New Labour against the monstrously untruthful charge that overspending caused the crash, but the failure to properly regulate the banks (yes, the Tories wanted even less regulation) certainly made it far worse, with dire consequences. On these, two of the biggest judgment calls of our time, the left was right and still seethes with resentment that it wasn\u2019t listened to.</p> <p>The problems go much deeper, of course. Social democracy is in crisis across Europe: there are many factors responsible, from the changing nature of the modern workforce to the current model of globalisation, to the financial crash, to its support for cuts and privatisation. Still, that is no excuse for a failure to reflect. Corbyn\u2019s opponents have long lacked a compelling vision, a significant support base and a strategy to win. When Labour fails at the ballot box, its cheerleaders are often accused of blaming their opponents rather than examining their own failures.</p> <p>The same accusation can be levelled now at Corbyn\u2019s opponents. They are, by turns, bewildered, infuriated, aghast, miserable about the rise of Corbynism. But they should take ownership of it, because it is their creation. Unless they reflect on their own failures \u2013 rather than spit fury at the success of others \u2013 they have no future. Deep down, they know it themselves.</p>",

of due process.\u201d</p> <p>The suit was launched on the second anniversary of the police killing of the unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, whose 2014 death sparked major protests in Ferguson, Missouri, and beyond, and reignited a national debate about the bias against minorities prevalent in the US justice system.</p> <p>That case led to increased scrutiny of St Louis County, a jurisdiction made up of a maze of 90 constituent municipalities \u2013 including Ferguson \u2013 81 of which are responsible for their own police and court systems.</p> <p>In the wake of Brown\u2019s death, the justice department in 2014 launched a federal investigation into Ferguson\u2019s criminal justice system, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/2015/mar/04/ferguson-police-racial-persecution-federal-report\">culminating in a damning assessment</a> in March 2015, which decried an overly punitive approach to policing that largely affects residents of color.</p> <p>The report also singled out the legal system for its reliance on generating revenue from mostly poor citizens as one of the key impediments to serious reform. \u201cFerguson\u2019s law enforcement practices are shaped by the city\u2019s focus on revenue rather than by public safety needs,\u201d the justice department report stated.</p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s suit describes how this revenue-focused policing model has continued apace in St Louis County\u2019s neighboring municipalities.</p> <p>All of the plaintiffs in the case were jailed for failure to provide a cash payment related to a fee or fine, the suit says.</p> <p>In 2015, the municipalities listed in the suit issued an average of 1.7 arrest warrants per household, and one arrest warrant for every adult, mostly for \u201cminor municipal ordinance violations, like traffic tickets\u201d.</p> <p>The suit points to a \u201cdirect correlation between the revenue that a particular municipality raises through fines and fees and the population of black and impoverished residents living in that municipality\u201d.</p> <p>The justice department has decried the practice of using unpaid fees as a means of imprisoning indigent defendants, and not only in its Ferguson report.</p> <p>In March, it <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-resources-assist-state-and-local-reform-fine-and-fee-practices\">sent a letter to court administrators and police officials in all 50 states</a>, warning local court systems and police departments against the unlawful use of fees and fines and trapping poor defendants in an escalating cycle from which they may not escape.</p> <p>Without directly threatening federal action, the letter also noted that local court systems that receive federal money risked violating the Civil Right Acts of 1964 if \u201cthey unnecessarily impose disparate harm on the basis of race or national origin\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe consequences of the criminalization of poverty are not only harmful \u2013 they are far-reaching,\u201d said attorney general Loretta Lynch at the time. \u201cThey not only affect an individual\u2019s ability to support their family, but also contribute to an erosion of our faith in government.\u201d</p> <p>The suit follows a similar one launched last year against the municipalities of Ferguson and Jennings by ArchCity Defenders and two other civil rights groups.</p> <p>Last month, the small city of Jennings, Missouri, ended up settling that lawsuit, agreeing to pay some $4.7m to approximately 2,000 residents, the majority of them poor and black.</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of a class-wide settlement agreement, this is the largest on a case like this,\u201d said Michael-John Voss, cofounder of ArchCity Defenders, the St Louis not-for-profit group representing the plaintiffs.</p> <p>Voss said his organization was hoping to build on that result.</p> <p>\u201cI think it sets a precedent for other towns in this region that they\u2019re on notice,\u201d Voss said.</p> <p>The new legal action was brought by ArchCity Defenders and Arnold &amp; Porter, a national law firm, on behalf of 12 plaintiffs against 13 municipalities adjacent to <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/ferguson\">Ferguson, Missouri</a>, in St Louis County.</p> <p>A separate lawsuit filed on Tuesday, which was also initiated by ArchCity Defenders along with the St Louis-based Dowd &amp; Dowd law firm, challenges how law enforcement handled charges against protesters.</p> <p>That legal action, also filed in federal court in Missouri, is asking for $20m in compensation and an acknowledgment that the city of Ferguson engaged in the malicious prosecution of four individuals who they say peacefully protested at a vigil just two days after Michael Brown\u2019s 2014 death.</p> <p>The city subsequently spent thousands of dollars prosecuting the cases, according to the suit, even after the justice department\u2019s 2015 report.</p> <p>In March of this year, a month after a <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/2016/feb/10/ferguson-department-of-justice-lawsuit-police-reforms\">justice department lawsuit against the city</a> to force its hand on criminal justice reforms, Ferguson agreed to settle with the federal government under a reform agreement called a \u201cConsent Decree\u201d.</p> <p>But the second suit released on Tuesday asserts that that agreement came with a carve-out that it would not affect some cases that had already been under consideration.</p> <p>In its March 2015 report, the justice department described how the \u201cfailure to comply\u201d ordnance of Ferguson \u2013 which allowed the city to arrest many protesters after the shooting death of Brown during protests even if they were they were peaceful \u2013 was often applied in an unconstitutional and racially discriminatory manner.</p> <p>But the lawsuit argues that while the Consent Decree required Ferguson to address the \u201cuse of arrest in retaliation for exercise of protected speech, it did not require Ferguson to dismiss existing charges against those, like Plaintiffs, who had been arrested on frivolous and retaliatory \u2018failure to comply\u2019 charges\u201d.</p> <p>Jasmine Woods, the lead plaintiff in that lawsuit, was acquitted of all charges in April 2016 along with her three co-plaintiffs. </p> <p>\u201cI felt like someone should be held accountable,\u201d Woods said of the lawsuit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

  "<p>The Scottish government is to redirect \u00a3100m from a budget underspend last year into a new initiative to help cushion the economy from the impacts of a post-EU referendum downturn. </p> <p>Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, said the spending was needed to help stimulate the already weak Scottish economy in the wake of the \u201cdeep and widespread uncertainty\u201d caused by the Brexit vote in June.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK government has not yet taken any meaningful action to alleviate uncertainty or to boost confidence, and there are very real concerns that the damage to the economy and to jobs will be severe and long-lasting,\u201d Sturgeon said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is against this background that the Scottish government is announcing early action to boost confidence, stimulate economic activity and support business.\u201d</p> <p>The initiative, unveiled with a \u00a35m capital project for new medical facilities at the Golden Jubilee hospital in Clydebank, will be known as a capital acceleration programme and will largely be devoted to speeding up existing projects.</p> <p>Despite the implication that the government was bringing forward future spending or using new money, Sturgeon\u2019s official statement on Wednesday did not make it clear that the funds had come from a \u00a3115m underspend last year.</p> <p>A spokesman also added that the \u00a3100m had not yet been allocated or committed. There was no guarantee it would all be spent, and no date yet fixed for updating the Scottish parliament on how and where the money would be used.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a range of factors to be worked through. I can\u2019t say whether this money will be used for new projects or accelerated projects,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Holyrood was told in June that the Scottish government had underspent last year by \u00a375m in its resource budget for day-to-day spending in colleges, schools, and community and housing, and \u00a340m underspent in its capital budget. </p> <p>The finance secretary, Derek Mackay, also told MSPs there was a further \u00a340m underspend from financial transactions, which was ringfenced for loans and equity investments in the private sector. </p> <p>Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour\u2019s economy spokeswoman, said the \u00a3100m seemed like a drop in the ocean against the cost of major infrastructure projects. \u201cThis money coming from previous SNP government underspends shows that it could already have been invested in vital projects,\u201d she said. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s welcome that the SNP are taking Labour\u2019s advice on responding to the economic shocks of Brexit, but this is beginning to look like an attempt to grab headlines rather than a meaningful programme of investment.\u201d</p> <p>Economists at the Fraser of Allander Institute (FAI) warned in late July that the Brexit vote would have a significant impact on Scotland\u2019s already weak economy, which has been underperforming compared to the UK overall since the global crash in oil prices, pushing it towards recession. </p> <p>The FAI downgraded its GDP forecasts for Scotland for each of the next three years, by 0.5% this year, 1.4% for next year and 1.3% in 2018. Scottish unemployment was likely to rise to 7% next year, it added.</p> <p>Sturgeon\u2019s announcement follows her visit to Berlin on Tuesday to meet Germany\u2019s Europe minister, Michael Roth, where she again set out her case for a favourable deal for Scotland with the EU in the Brexit talks. </p> <p>Little emerged about the content of the talks, but both ministers said they were constructive. Roth said his government was anxious to preserve Europe\u2019s cohesion during and after the Brexit process.</p> <p>In a statement issued through the Scottish government, Roth said: \u201cThis has been a very pleasant and constructive conversation between two dedicated pro-Europeans and has demonstrated once again that a degree of Europe\u2019s strength lies in its diversity. I hope that the UK finds a way forward that will benefit Europe as a whole in the end.\u201d</p> <p>David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, was in Glasgow on Wednesday to meet business and community leaders to press the UK government\u2019s competing case for a collective cross-government approach to Brexit. </p> <p>Business groups and the Scottish TUC welcomed Sturgeon\u2019s announcement, although the Scottish Retail Consortium said it came as ministers were putting up business rates on top of a \u00a362m rates hike for larger shops. </p> <p>Grahame Smith, the general secretary of the Scottish TUC, said he strongly the new strategy strongly. \u201cThe Scottish economy, already weak due to the downturn in the oil and gas sector, risks falling into technical recession as a result of Brexit-induced uncertainty. In this context, it is important that the Scottish government accelerates capital projects where feasible in order to support employment.\u201d</p>",

But the appeal judges unanimously declared the refusal did not contravene the principle of equal treatment and was not discriminatory.<br></p> <p>MB\u2019s lawyers argued before the supreme court that the DWP\u2019s reliance on domestic UK pensions legislation was in contravention of EU laws.<br></p> <p>The case poses the question of whether European law \u201cprecludes the imposition in national law of a requirement that, in addition to satisfying the physical, social and psychological criteria for recognising a change of gender, a person who has changed gender must also be unmarried in order to qualify for a state retirement pension\u201d.<br></p> <p>When the Gender Recognition Act was passed, \u201ca valid marriage could subsist in law only between a man and a woman\u201d. Under the provisions of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013, which came into full force in December 2014, a full gender-recognition certificate can be obtained without a marriage having to be annulled, provided the applicant\u2019s spouse consents. But those provisions are not retrospective and do not give MB any right to a pension from the age of 60. </p> <p>The supreme court\u2019s deputy president, Brenda Hale, along with Nicholas Wilson, Jonathan Sumption, Roger Toulson and Patrick Hodge, said the court was divided on the correct answer to the question and that \u201csince there is no CJEU authority directly in point, it refers the question for their guidance\u201d.<br></p> <p>Christopher Stothers, of the law firm Arnold and Porter, representing MB, said it was pleased with the decision, but the slowness of getting the case resolved was \u201chighly frustrating for the pensioners involved\u201d. </p> <p>He said: \u201cThere are various related cases which have all been delated pending the outcome of the supreme court judgment. Although the numbers are small \u2013 those affected potentially in the hundreds, with cases in the tens \u2013 this is an important test of the UK\u2019s commitment to diversity and inclusivity.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>It\u2019s hard to read Decca Aitkenhead\u2019s Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/09/tom-watson-interview-jeremy-corbyn-labour-rifts-hug-shout\">interview with an emollient Tom Watson</a> and not feel sorry for Labour\u2019s deputy leader as he struggles to pick his way through the debris produced by near catastrophic errors \u2013 made by other people \u2013 without making things worse.</p> <p> In the present fevered climate of anger and mutual mistrust, even such a bland assertion is likely to generate snorts of derision from one side or both. Jeremy Corbyn is a \u201cgive peace a chance\u201d man, but like many such self-styled idealists his failure to provide effective leadership piles up the rubble and risk for those around him.</p> <p> As a working-class trade union MP, with his own elected mandate, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Watson_(Labour_politician) \">Watson</a> is a piggy in several middles. Not a Corbynista but an active critic of Tony Blair (treacherous some would say), he has been an opponent of much of what both Corbyn and shadow cabinet colleagues have done since the traumatic Brexit vote shook British politics. His own Unite union\u2019s Mr Big, Len McCluskey, is on Corbyn\u2019s side.</p> <p> So the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/09/trotskyists-young-labour-members-jeremy-corbyn-tom-watson \">page one warning</a>  against Trotskyite infiltration of Labour\u2019s ranks \u2013 a re-run of the 70s and pre-Kinnock 80s \u2013 may not have been the cautious, unifying message he would have chosen from the Aitkenhead interview, but it has landed him in fresh trouble with John McDonnell, one of the brains propping up Corbyn. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6924d11305b1662b485a9dff46b7a652e979a60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6924d11305b1662b485a9dff46b7a652e979a60/189_46_5503_3302/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn speaks at a rally in College Green in Bristol.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn speaks at a rally in College Green in Bristol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Stone/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> The Trot entryist allegation may be unpopular, it may only involve relatively few new recruits or retreads, but their presence and intimidating way of operating will be disproportionately felt in the months to come: the \u201csnarling face of the left\u201d, as old hands put it. Check out the Socialist party (formerly the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militant_(Trotskyist_group)\">Militant Tendency </a>) <a href=\"http://www.socialistparty.org.uk/\">website</a> where Peter Taaffe remains the driving force at 73 and claims the Blairites are the \u201creal entryists\u201d.</p> <p>The battle within Labour is a bit like a hostile corporate takeover in which the US bidder \u2013 let\u2019s say Kraft stalking a much-loved brand like Cadbury\u2019s \u2013 enlists shareholder support by making wild promises it doesn\u2019t plan to keep and playing on a weak and divided board. As usual it\u2019s the workers and customers who get shafted or shift to other brands.</p> <p> So 24 hours after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/labour-must-allow-all-members-leadership-vote-court-rules\">Corbyn\u2019s gains on Labour\u2019s national executive committee</a> (NEC) and his supporters\u2019 high court win on the right of new members to vote for him or Owen Smith, led to insider claims that he is now \u201cunassailable\u201d to look a bit daft. Two extra seats does not guarantee control of the NEC for what that\u2019s still worth if Theresa May consolidates that poll lead.</p> <p> Not daft in the sense that Smith will not beat Jez to become Labour\u2019s leader on 24 September. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence of \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse\u201d among Corbyn voters in 2015, among them old sweats who really should have known better but not on the scale needed to overturn that mistake, one which the mass membership will eventually have to own.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b85dcad068d757a89f6e587c73dbb6210b45edd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b85dcad068d757a89f6e587c73dbb6210b45edd9/0_47_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Len McCluskey, the leader of Unite\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Len McCluskey, the leader of Unite, backs Corbyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> As Watson says in his Guardian interview, many newcomers are on a journey. It will either quickly bore them \u2013 no New Jerusalem by next week? \u2013 or turn them into useful, realistic activists who actually want to win elections, not just posture with a placard. I cherish the notion that one of Ed Miliband\u2019s \u00a33 recruits (another bad mistake) will one day be an effective Labour PM.</p> <p>But not any time soon on current trends. \u201cUnassailable\u201d is also daft in the sense that the Corbyn project looks ever more adrift from underlying political realities. </p> <p> Subject to a high court appeal (itself foolish and reportedly Watson\u2019s own mistake?), the party may have to postpone the election (and pay back those \u00a325 fees, another silly idea) so that the 130,000 disenfranchised can be vetted and take part. One of the high court five is reported to be an \u201calmost lifelong\u201d Tory, another to be a self-styled \u201cReverend\u201d cleric. Are we surprised? No.</p> <p> But the conference itself may not take place in Liverpool at all because of a separate row over security. Last year the NEC voted (18 out of 31 members present) to discard G4S\u2019s services because of the firm\u2019s links with Israeli prisons, but has not found a suitable replacement. Showsec, the only security firm willing to do it, is in dispute with the GMB union over the right to recruit members. </p> <p> Neither monopolistic corporate Britain, nor Labour, comes out of this very well. But the Home Office has the power to veto the conference if it does not have proper security, too obvious a soft target for jihadis. G4S\u2019s squad may well be recalled to save the day. So much for ill-conceived gesture politics facing real-world choices.</p> <p> If all this sounds like a dog\u2019s breakfast that\u2019s because it is. All sorts of well-meaning people get in touch to put me right or offer solutions \u2013 here\u2019s an admirable <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://tomdlondon.blogspot.co.uk/2016/08/how-to-save-labour-party.html?spref=tw\">sample piece, </a> which serves to highlight the gulf that exists within Labour\u2019s ranks. Here\u2019s an <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/2016/08/explaining-love-jeremy-corbyn\">excellent counter-argument</a> from Helen Lewis in the New Statesman.</p> <p> As Lewis says, large enthusiastic meetings \u2013 Corbyn pulled 2,000 in small-c conservative west Cornwall the other day (John Wesley managed 20,000) \u2013 feel democratic, but Facebook is more reliable in 2016. A friend reports from a Corbyn rally in the south-east that it felt very old-fashioned and inward-looking.</p> <p> That too will be dismissed by assorted Corbynistas, as \u201cBlarite\u201d or \u201cmainstream media spin\u201d. But as Wednesday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/09/the-guardian-view-on-labours-troubles-dividing-not-ruling\">Guardian editorial</a> rightly points out, if Watson, Miliband (now backing Smith) and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/andy-burnham-selected-labours-candidate-manchester-mayor\">Andy \u201cManchester mayor\u201d Burnham</a> are all ringing the alarm bell in different ways from different perspectives, their warnings should not lightly be dismissed. </p> <p> In dangerous times like these \u2013 the Age of Trump \u2013 Labour should not \u2013 and will not \u2013 split.

The night ended in atrocities: violence, torture, arrest and the imprisonment of LGBTI people, including myself.</p> <p>I was seated in the audience when Ugandan police armed to the teeth walked into the venue. They wanted to immediately stop the proceedings. As I started talking to them, they arrested me and my colleague, one of the Pride organisers. My hands were cuffed together with another friend who had organised the event that night. Sixteen of us were arrested for sitting enjoying ourselves, committing no known crime. I was then pushed under the seats of a police pick-up truck and, amid insults and abuse, driven at a high speed to the police station where I was detained for about two hours.</p> <p>Other friends describe that some participants were being held at gunpoint at the club, as police forced them to sit on the ground and have their photos taken by journalists. Before I was taken from the club I saw police beating up transgender people, a trans woman was forcefully being dragged down the stairs by a man not in police uniform. Trans men and women were touched inappropriately as officers of the Ugandan police force tried to establish their \u201creal gender\u201d. They also pulled on a trans women\u2019s hair saying: \u201cWhat is this? This is women\u2019s hair; you are a man.\u201d I was told some police officers holding two men at gunpoint claimed that they were caught having sex.

At some point during the night, inmates ordered us to bathe using a dirty water basin and a small piece of soap in a room lit only by a candle. I had to hand my clothes to another inmate who watched to make sure I bathed and there was only small a piece of cloth hanging by the bathroom door for privacy, what looked like an old torn curtain. The intention was clearly to humiliate and intimidate us. Some of my friends were beaten up for \u201cnot bathing properly\u201d.</p> <p>We were then called out of the police cell and paraded into a line and told that we would have to be physically checked to ascertain our gender.

  "<p>Peter Taaffe, the veteran leader of Militant \u2013 the hard-left group pushed out of Labour in the 1980s and now renamed the Socialist party \u2013 expects to be readmitted to Labour if Jeremy Corbyn wins September\u2019s leadership election.</p> <p>Taaffe, who was a founding editor of the Militant newspaper and has remained active throughout the movement\u2019s existence, said he had sounded out Corbyn indirectly, including through Mark Serwotka, the leader of the PCS union, about the possibility of reversing Neil Kinnock\u2019s ban on Militant.</p> <p>He said he had met Corbyn on a number of occasions over the years, and believed the leader would continue to open up Labour \u201cto all strands of socialist and working-class opinion\u201d and reject control by a \u201ctop-down, centralised elite\u201d. He added: \u201cThe lava of this revolution is still hot.\u201d</p> <p>The Socialist party\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.socialistparty.org.uk/\">website</a> reports that members have attended a number of rallies and meetings of Momentum, the grassroots movement set up to back Corbyn.

He\u2019s referring to entryists, but we were not entryists, we were born in the Labour party, and we were expelled because we fought Thatcher in Liverpool and defeated her.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, he said MPs who backed Tony Blair \u2013 who won three successive general elections for Labour \u2013 were \u201cTory entryists into the Labour party\u201d.</p> <p>Neil Kinnock\u2019s purging of Militant, which culminated in a strongly worded conference speech in 1985 in which he berated the Militant deputy leader of Liverpool council, Derek Hatton, is regarded by many in Labour as a key moment in restoring the party\u2019s electability, though it was another 12 years before it won a general election.</p> <p>But Taaffe and his Socialist party colleagues still believe they should never have been thrown out. \u201cWe were the ones who mobilised people against the poll tax and brought down the Thatcher government,\u201d Taaffe said. Of Kinnock and his colleagues, he said: \u201cThey thought by an administrative measure they could erase social forces from history.\u201d</p> <p>Militant was criticised for operating as a \u201cparty within a party\u201d, but Taaffe said: \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between us being affiliated to the Labour party, in an open and democratic way, and the Co-op party being affiliated?\u201d</p> <p>He said he saw Corbyn\u2019s leadership, and the rapid increase in the size of the Labour party, as part of a global phenomenon that could not be halted by opposition among Labour MPs. \u201cNothing they can do will stop the winds of history as they\u2019re developing at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>On Tuesday Corbyn\u2019s campaign team condemned Watson for \u201cpeddling conspiracy theories\u201d after he warned of \u201cold hands twisting young arms\u201d to shore up support for Corbyn.</p> <p>Taaffe rejected the idea that Socialist party members were only interested in promulgating political revolution rather than winning parliamentary representation.</p> <p>He pointed out that Militant had stood candidates in a number of elections, and its successor organisations had continued to do so, adding that the route to progress for the working classes was \u201cnot exclusively on the streets, or the industrial struggle \u2013 the parliamentary struggle is crucial\u201d.</p> <p>Taaffe\u2019s intervention will alarm many in Labour who fear that veterans of struggles to deselect sitting MPs regarded as on the right of the party in the 1980s have been emboldened by Corbyn\u2019s decision to shift Labour decisively to the left.</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s allies have said they want to \u201ccircle the wagons\u201d if, as expected, he wins re-election, and tempt back some of the Labour MPs who resigned from his shadow cabinet.</p> <p>But Taaffe said he should resist the temptation to compromise on his commitment to anti-austerity policies. \u201cThe big mistake for Jeremy Corbyn would be to seek peace with these people,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cJeremy Corbyn has said austerity is a political choice, not a necessity. That\u2019s the Ark of the Covenant of the movement at the present time.\u201d</p> <p>Later a spokesman for Corbyn said the party\u2019s policy on proscribed groups, including the Socialist Party, had not changed.</p> <h2>Militant history</h2> <p>The clash between the Labour party leadership and the far-left Militant faction was one of the definitive political battles of the 1970s and 1980s. Members of the Trotskyist group, which began as the Revolutionary Socialist League associated with the Militant newspaper, campaigned to get its members elected to key roles in the national Labour party in order to further its agenda.</p> <p>Reg Underhill, Labour\u2019s national agent, repeatedly tried to expel Militant in the late 1970s but the move was rejected by Labour\u2019s national executive committee. Labour\u2019s Young Socialist division was controlled by members of Militant by 1976, with a Militant member the party\u2019s national youth organiser.</p> <p>In 1982 the group was proscribed by the NEC for contravention of the party\u2019s constitution, which said groups could not be affiliated if they had \u201cprogramme, principles and policy for separate and distinctive propaganda\u201d. Five members of the Militant newspaper\u2019s editorial board were expelled from the party, along with many other activists over the following years. However, at its peak in the mid-1980s, membership numbered more than 8,000.</p> <p>The faction\u2019s biggest electoral success was in Liverpool, where the local party and city council were run by members of Militant who went on to set an illegal deficit budget in 1985, in defiance of party policy. The slogan of the local council was \u201cBetter to break the law than break the poor.\u201d</p> <p>With spending higher than income, the council was advised that it would be unable to pay staff wages by November that year, and Militant members decided to issue redundancy notices to every council worker, as a threat to the national government to increase the budget.</p> <p>Speaking at the 1985 Labour party conference, Kinnock condemned the \u201cgrotesque chaos of a Labour council hiring taxis to scuttle round the city handing out redundancy notices to its own workers\u201d. The Liverpool Labour party was suspended soon afterwards by the NEC.</p> <p>Several Militant members were elected as MPs: Dave Nellist and Terry Fields in 1983 and Pat Wall in 1987. Fields was imprisoned for 60 days for non-payment of the new poll tax, a strategy promoted by Militant. The group was a leading organiser of demonstrations against the poll tax, and set up local and national anti-poll tax unions. Kinnock opposed the strategy of non-payment, famously saying: \u201cLawmakers must not be lawbreakers. I have always made that clear.\u201d</p> <p>In the early 1990s, Militant made formal moves away from the Labour party, setting up the independent Scottish Militant Labour and supporting candidates in Liverpool from a National Union of Students faction called Broad Left. In 1991, Militant declared itself a separate organisation under the name Militant Labour.</p> <p>Of the Labour MPs who had been backed by Militant, Wall died in 1990, and Fields and Nellist were expelled from the party before the 1992 election. Both stood against the official Labour candidates but lost their seats.<br></p> <p>After Tony Blair\u2019s election in 1997, Militant Labour changed its name to the Socialist party of England and Wales.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 August 2016. An earlier version said Terry Fields was expelled from the Labour party in 1991 and Dave Nellist was deselected. Both were expelled.</p>",
  "<p>The human brain is often said to be the most complex object in the known universe, and there\u2019s good reason to believe that it is. That lump of jelly inside your head contains at least 80 billion nerve cells, or neurons, and even more of the non-neuronal cells called glia. Between them, they form hundreds of trillions of precise synaptic connections; but they all have moveable parts, and these connections can change. Neurons can extend and retract their delicate fibres; some types of glial cells can crawl through the brain; and neurons and glia routinely work together to create new connections and eliminate old ones.</p> <p>These processes begin before we are born, and occur until we die, making the brain a highly dynamic organ that undergoes continuous change throughout life. At any given moment, many millions of them are being modified in one way or another, to reshape the brain\u2019s circuitry in response to our daily experiences. Researchers at Yale University have now developed an imaging technique that enables them to visualise the density of synapses in the living human brain, and offers a promising new way of studying how the organ develops and functions, and also how it deteriorates in various neurological and psychiatric conditions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2015/oct/16/brains-immune-cells-hyperactive-in-schizophrenia\">Brain\u2019s immune cells hyperactive in schizophrenia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The new method, developed in <a href=\"http://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/richard-e-carson\">Richard Carson</a>\u2019s lab at Yale\u2019s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, is based on positron emission tomography (<a href=\"http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/test_procedures/neurological/positron_emission_tomography_pet_scan_92,p07654/\">PET</a>), which detects the radiation emitted by radioactive \u2018tracers\u2019 that bind to specific proteins or other molecules after being injected into the body. Until now, the density of synapses in the human brain could only be determined by autopsy, using antibodies that bind to and stain specific synaptic proteins, or electron microscopy to examine the fine structure of the tissue.</p> <p>To get around this, the researchers designed a radioactive tracer molecule called [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J, which binds to a protein called SV2A, which is found exclusively in synaptic vesicles at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2014/may/29/3d-model-nerve-terminal\">nerve terminals</a>, and which <a href=\"http://www.jneurosci.org/content/26/4/1303.full\">regulates the release of neurotransmitter molecules</a> from them, a vital step in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2016/apr/02/nerve-terminal-nanofilaments-control-brain-signalling\">brain signalling</a>. Other research teams have developed similar <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24446373\">tracers</a> that <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27260773\">bind SV2A</a>, but so far these have only been tested in rats, pigs and monkeys.</p> <p>In order to determine that [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J is a reliable marker for synapse density, Carson and his colleagues injected the molecule into an olive baboon and scanned the monkey\u2019s brain. This revealed that the tracer is taken up quickly by the brain tissue, becoming highly concentrated in the cerebral cortex, which consists largely of grey matter densely packed with synapses, but not in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2014/apr/24/white-matter-synaptic-plasticity\">white matter tracts</a>, which contains few or no synapses, within 6 to 16 minutes after the injection.</p> <p>They then dissected the brain and took tissue samples from 12 different regions. Closer examination of these samples using antibody staining further revealed that SV2A levels correspond very closely to those of another protein called synaptophysin, which is considered to be the gold standard of synaptic density, and is used widely to estimate synapse numbers in brain tissue samples. Furthermore, SV2A distribution in the tissue samples was very closely correlated to the measurements obtained earlier by the PET scan, demonstrating that SV2A can be used to accurately measure the density of synapses.</p> <p>Next, the researchers injected their tracer into five healthy human volunteers, and then scanned their brains, to obtain the very first images of synaptic density in the living human brain. The results were comparable to those seen in the monkey, with the radioactive signal peaking in the grey matter of the cortex within 6 to 15 minutes after injection, and then starting to decline steadily shortly afterwards. </p> <p>Finally, they repeated this in three patients diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy. In all three, the scans showed decreased uptake of the radioactive tracer in the hippocampus, but only on that side of the brain that had previously been damaged by seizures. This not only confirms earlier reports that temporal lobe is associated with the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK98161/\">loss of synapses</a>, but also that [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J is sensitive enough to detect it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2014/may/29/3d-model-nerve-terminal\">3D model of a nerve terminal in atomic detail | Mo Costandi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Synapses are destroyed in numerous other neurological diseases, including <a href=\"https://molecularneurodegeneration.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1750-1326-6-63\">Alzheimer\u2019s</a>, in which the gradual decline of memory function is likely due to loss of synapses in the hippocampus, and <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3491115/\">major depressive disorder</a>, which is known to involve altered synapse function in the prefrontal cortex. This particular brain region also undergoes extensive synapse loss in adolescence, during which some 40% of the total number of brain synapses are eliminated, a process which we now know continues well into the second decade of life.</p> <p>Unwanted and damaged synapses are engulfed by microglial cells, the brain\u2019s resident immune cells, in a process called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2011/aug/19/neuroscience-microglia-synapses\">synaptic pruning</a>, and it\u2019s now widely believed that aberrant pruning during early brain development and adolescence could cause, or at least contribute to, conditions such as <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(14)00651-5\">autism</a> and schizophrenia. (Last year, researchers in London used PET imaging with another radioactive tracer to show that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2015/oct/16/brains-immune-cells-hyperactive-in-schizophrenia\">microglial cells are hyperactive</a> in the brains of patients with schizophrenia.) </p> <p>Refinement of PET imaging using such tracers therefore offers a promising new approach to investigating the changes in synaptic density that occur during brain growth and maturation. It may also provide fresh insights into how diseases that involve synaptic loss develop and progress and, eventually, may even aid in their diagnosis.</p> <h2><strong>Reference</strong></h2> <p>Finnema, S.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/zika/intheus/florida-update.html\">travel warning</a> for only the one-mile radius around Wynwood; 10 square miles have already been sprayed twice by planes carrying insecticide called Naled.</p> <p>Big Bus tours still rolled through the neighborhood in early August, and galleries and cafes were open. But after cases of locally acquired Zika were reported, local media dubbed the neighborhood a \u201c<a href=\"http://miami.cbslocal.com/2016/08/07/insecticide-rains-down-on-miamis-zika-zone/\">ghost town</a>\u201d.

Specifically, she said two of her friends who were trying to get pregnant had stopped coming to Wynwood. \u201cThe people that live here, I would say, are a lot more concerned than even the tourists.\u201d</p> <p>Workers in Wynwood describe it as \u201cbooming\u201d and \u201cup-and-coming\u201d. It\u2019s the sort of neighborhood where laptops are carried to lunch, and office workers appear in tone-conscious shift dresses or office-edgy sneakers. Models teeter by in stilettos, on their way to shoots. </p> <p>But in the neighborhood, sentiments are genuinely mixed about the Zika warnings. Awareness is good, many said. Scaring people isn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how much of it is genuine, or we\u2019re doing this to create awareness, or they\u2019re doing it to get funding for Zika,\u201d said Neville Burde, the manager of the Miami Underground (MUG) coffee shop. </p> <p>MUG was one of the shops visited by Florida governor Rick Scott, a Republican who toured the neighborhood in the first week of August before holding a press conference to repeatedly emphasize that Florida is \u201csafe\u201d despite the increasing number of locally transmitted cases. </p> <p>Burde said after Scott left he felt politicked, as if Scott had only visited so he could later say he had spoken to business owners. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc3d3c46f6b46772d50ec42be170e66dc9bdbae3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc3d3c46f6b46772d50ec42be170e66dc9bdbae3/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Visitors take pictures of a mural in Wynwood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Visitors take pictures of a mural in Wynwood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Skipper/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing they\u2019re doing something, but it\u2019s tricky,\u201d he said; the recent media attention was \u201cfreaking everyone out\u201d. The hair salon attached to MUG, which teaches stylists how to use very high-end products, even had a couple of stylists cancel lessons upon the news.</p> <p>Cindy Blandon, 23, who lives about a 10-minute drive from Wynwood, said she sprayed on insect repellent before leaving the house. </p> <p>\u201cYou never know,\u201d she said, whether a mosquito that lands on you has the virus, though she conceded she felt the virus was \u201ceverywhere\u201d. She used repellant even though she is not trying to get pregnant. </p> <p>For Christina Madison, a 28-year-old transplant from Ohio who recently opened the Art &amp; Sol gallery, the real test will be art walk, an open-gallery event that usually draws hundreds to the neighborhood. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely slowed down,\u201d she said. \u201cThe test of time is art walk.\u201d Two bottles of organic mosquito repellant sat on her desk.</p> <p>\u201cEven just driving here, I look around and I\u2019m like, \u2018Wow, where are all the people?\u2019\u201d Madison said. But, she said, the US has had previous \u201cscares\u201d, such as the spread of H1N1 flu, Ebola and the mosquito-transmitted West Nile virus. \u201cPeople just need to protect themselves \u2026 Come out, don\u2019t be a hermit.\u201d </p> <p>Wynwood is just west of the famous shorelines of Miami Beach (think South Beach), just far enough north of downtown Miami to still spy cranes assembling new high-rises. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6ff9d3d98eb524fa476c49644eb1f5c88d56b31c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ff9d3d98eb524fa476c49644eb1f5c88d56b31c/0_138_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"christina madison with paintings\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christina Madison, 28, recently opened Art &amp; Sol gallery in Wynwood.

The population has increased nearly 6% between 2000 and 2010 and represents about one-third of people living in the downtown Miami area, according to a 2011 demographic profile conducted by real estate group Goodkin Consulting. </p> <p>Workers are targeting the <em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquito, Zika\u2019s primary vector and a notoriously difficult-to-kill bug that prefers to live in or near homes and around people. It can live in closets, in living rooms, or under leaves in the yard.</p> <p>The sheer volume of places the <em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquito can breed is stunning. Researchers often reference the bottle cap as evidence of how little water it takes for eggs to hatch \u2013 which makes the volume of overturned sofas, styrofoam cups and piles of plastic around Wynwood seem overwhelming. </p> <p>City infrastructure alone, left untreated, provides 150,000 storm drains that collect water, and potential mosquito breeding habitat, for <em>Aedes aegypti</em> in Miami-Dade County. County workers, including not just mosquito control but also cleaners, have since been enlisted to put larvicide tablets into the drains. </p> <p>Until the \u201cZika situation\u201d, a county spokesperson said, the strapped budget of the Miami-Dade mosquito control division allowed for only 12 full-time mosquito control workers. Those workers were supposed to cover all of the approximately 1,800 square miles of Miami-Dade County, including the roughly 1,315 people that live in each mile. All told, about 2.6 million people live in Miami-Dade, encompassing a vast, water-covered south-eastern tip of Florida.</p> <p>With a budget controlled by county politics, though, the mosquito control division\u2019s funding was regularly cut through 2012. According to a presentation by the division, funding for mosquito control in Miami-Dade peaked in 2006 with $3.7m, and by 2012 dropped to just $1.5m. </p> <p>Scott\u2019s visit to the neighborhood was used in part to lobby Congress for funding, despite his record for slashing local mosquito funding so sharply that the Florida Mosquito Control Association warned there could be <a href=\"http://fmel.ifas.ufl.edu/buzz/wtera.shtml\">disastrous consequences</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"127c316bf05062d738b9d6560143c71562098681\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/127c316bf05062d738b9d6560143c71562098681/0_4_4522_2714/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Big Bus tours still rolled through the neighborhood in early August, and galleries and cafes were open.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Big Bus tours still rolled through the neighborhood in early August, and galleries and cafes were open.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Diaz/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nearly one-third of the state\u2019s mosquito scientists left the state when it shut down a pesticide research lab in Panama City. Another 20% left when the Florida Medical Entomology Lab saw its funding slashed. State funds for mosquito control have been slashed by 50%, much of it <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-florida-mosquitoes-idUSTRE76E66H20110715\">personally vetoed by Scott</a>, according to <a href=\"http://fmel.ifas.ufl.edu/buzz/wtera.shtml\">the director of entomology at the University of Florida</a>. </p> <p>As this took place, the number of West Nile virus cases transmitted in Florida grew from zero in 2006 to 69 in 2012, the <a href=\"http://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/west-nile-virus/\">most recent year for which data is available</a>. </p> <p>Now, as the state battles Zika, the little-understood African virus that has country-hopped through Latin America and the Caribbean, Miami-Dade has hired dozens more mosquito control workers and contracted expensive aerial spraying, despite its debated effectiveness. </p> <p>In Florida, there are hundreds of travel associated cases of Zika. By the second week in August, 16 cases of Zika were confirmed in Wynwood, and another in Palm Beach county is believed to be connected. Three more case investigations are pending. </p> <p>However, the exactitude of that number conveys a deceiving precision. </p> <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/zika/hc-providers/testing-for-zikavirus.html\">still recommends testing only pregnant women</a> who have traveled to areas known to have Zika for the virus, or whose partners have the virus (Zika can be sexually transmitted). In other words, places that are vulnerable to the disease, but where local transmission hasn\u2019t been proven, may face difficulty getting a test. </p> <p>For example, in Puerto Rico, where the <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2016/06/17/zika-virus-spreading-rapidly-across-puerto-rico/\">CDC has estimated as much as 26%</a> of the 3.5 million people who live there could be infected with Zika, only about 5,400 cases have been confirmed. In part, this is because four out of five people show no symptoms at all, so they have no reason to seek treatment. </p> <p>\u201cUntil we had our first locally transmitted cases, that the message was out there ... I just don\u2019t think people were focused on it,\u201d said Gayle Love, a spokeswoman for the Miami-Dade mosquito control division. </p> <p>\u201cNow with all of this awareness, all of the attention that\u2019s been brought to Miami-Dade because we have the first locally transmitted, cases people are clearly more interested in the message,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re understanding that they are the first line of defense in mosquito control\u2026 They have to be the ones to go out and inspect the yards, and turn over those kiddy pools from the summer,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has been a bringing together of the community, getting everyone to recognize every citizen needs to do their part.\u201d </p>",

In a division flooded with money and a transfer window that more resembles an arms race, it is refreshing to see Swansea \u2013 a club free of debt and 21% owned by their fans \u2013 doing it their own way: bringing through youngsters from the academy and refusing to bow to mercenary agents.</p> <p>Except now, Swansea have inexplicably started to implode, selling and releasing a raft of players (Alberto Paloschi to Atlanta, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/10/france-portugal-euro-2016-match-report\">Euro 2016 hero \u00c9der to Lille</a>, Baf\u00e9timbi Gomis on loan to Marseille) at the beginning of the summer \u2013 without properly replacing them \u2013 and selling their best players at the end of it.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/08/west-ham-andre-ayew-swansea-record-signing\">Andr\u00e9 Ayew\u2019s \u00a320.5m move to West Ham</a> on Monday could be followed by the departure of Swansea\u2019s captain and talisman, Ashley Williams, to Everton for \u00a312m. In just a couple of days, Swansea have gone from mid-table lurkers to one of the favourites to go down. The manager Francesco Guidolin (who has no control over transfers since his ill-advised signing of Paloschi for \u00a38m in January) now has four days to rewrite his playbook and prepare for the possibility that his side could be roundly beaten by Burnley on the opening day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/swansea-zip/giv-12515DQG1MYhDGIdR/\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/swansea-zip/giv-12515DQG1MYhDGIdR/\">Graphic</a> </figure>  <p>The infuriating thing for Guidolin and Swansea fans is that now, with the shiny TV money rolling in, they don\u2019t have to sell, certainly not so late in the transfer window, and certainly not to divisional rivals. In the recent past, players have had to be sold to balance the books: Wilfried Bony, Joe Allen, Jonjo Shelvey, Scott Sinclair and Danny Graham, among others, have all been bought or developed, sold for a princely sum, and replaced on the cheap. But now, money is the one thing Swansea have loads of \u2013 a net profit of \u00a329.5m this summer \u2013 especially after an American consortium <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/05/swansea-city-takeover-premier-league\">acquired a 60% controlling stake in the club</a> in June for a reported \u00a3110m. It is quality in depth they need and there are no guarantees that the replacements they have bought or will buy will be up to it.</p> <p>Having sold four strikers, Swansea have at least bought one: the World Cup winner Fernando Llorente, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/04/swansea-agree-sign-fernando-llorente-sevilla\">signed last week from Sevilla</a>, and \u2013 despite a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsnb2MIhof8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2m11s\">horrendous open-goal miss on his debut</a> in a friendly against Rennes \u2013 he has (very) high hopes for the season ahead. \u201cIt is possible to win one of the cups.

The 23-year-old stood out in La Liga last season, on loan at struggling Eibar. Blessed with a quick brain and quicker feet, he has the potential to go to the very top, and it is a surprise that Diego Simeone seems willing to let him go, and that nobody else besides Swansea has tabled an offer. Meanwhile, the Holland Under-21 centre-back Mike van der Hoorn (who has shown he is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2013/apr/15/utrecht-own-goal-dutch-video\">prone to a goal-costing gaffe</a>) has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/06/swansea-city-signing-ajax-defender-mike-van-der-hoorn\">snaffled from Ajax</a> and with Williams gone, he will be thrown in at the deep end alongside Federico Fern\u00e1ndez.</p> <p>With Llorente and Bast\u00f3n over six feet, it seems apparent what tactics Guidolin has in mind. Stay competitive in midfield, get the ball wide to Jefferson Montero, Routledge, Dyer, Modou Barrow (who has looked sharp in pre-season) and get the ball into the box for Llorente or the instinctive Bast\u00f3n to finish. Simple. It is likely that Guidolin will not play Llorente together with Bast\u00f3n but instead revert to his favoured 4-2-3-1, although the addition of another striker, which is badly needed, would allow Swansea to deploy a two-pronged attack if necessary.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/08/west-ham-andre-ayew-swansea-record-signing\">West Ham sign Swansea\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Ayew for club record \u00a320.5m</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet should Swansea require a plan B, and they will at some point, giving the ball to Gylfi Sigurdsson and yelling \u201cshoot\u201d appears to be the only alternative at present.

Appointed when Swansea were in the relegation zone in January, he helped the club finish 10 points clear of the drop and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/11/swansea-city-francesco-guidolin-signs-new-contract\">earned a two-year contract</a>. When asked recently what his target for this season was, he replied: \u201cForty points. And if it is possible, to play well.\u201d At least the Italian is under no illusions as to the size of the task. Swansea have had a bad week, but underneath it all there is the bones of a good football team. If Guidolin is to get anywhere near his target or repeat last season\u2019s 12th-placed finish, a few more additions are essential to help replace Williams and co, and with such a small squad, Llorente, Bast\u00f3n, Van der Hoorn and Fer have to hit the ground running, or Swansea will surely face the drop.</p>",

But the RMT said that its own offer to meet, without preconditions, had in effect been rejected as Southern management was demanding to discuss terms only once the principle of proposed changes to the operation of doors \u2013 a technicality at the heart of the dispute \u2013 was accepted.</p> <p>The union\u2019s general secretary, Mick Cash, said: \u201cTheir position is that we can discuss anything we like as long as it\u2019s only what they want to discuss. That makes a mockery of the negotiation process and proves that they have no intention of ending this dispute regardless of the cost.\u201d</p> <p>Labour and the TUC, meanwhile, called on the government to urge GTR to restart talks. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said GTR should \u201curgently accept the offer of RMT to enter into immediate unconditional talks\u201d. He said Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, should act at once, adding: \u201cAll he needs to do is pick up the phone to GTR and rail services can be restored in time for tomorrow\u2019s rush hour. The long-suffering passengers will not understand why a government minister would do anything other than encourage all parties to embrace this opportunity.\u201d</p> <p>The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cHundreds of thousands of commuters will be wondering today why Southern rail is refusing to talk. And rail workers would far rather negotiate than strike. The government must send a clear message to Southern rail that they expect public service companies to sit down and negotiate instead of prolonging a dispute.\u201d</p> <p>Grayling and the rail minister, Paul Maynard, have ruled out direct talks between the government and the unions, but even some Conservatives now believe that such action could be necessary.</p> <p>Huw Merriman, a member of the transport select committee and the MP for Bexhill and Battle, whose constituents have been badly affected by the dispute, said Southern alone could not offer the guarantees on the future role of guards. </p> <p>He added: \u201cI can understand the reluctance to pander to the RMT. But the situation is now so serious, and affecting the lives of so many commuters, that the government needs to be directly involved.\u201d </p> <p>The strike, which started on Monday, has resulted in about 60% of normal services running.

The Southern contract is not, like most of those granted to train operators, a franchise but rather a management contract. The key difference is that this means all the revenue from fares goes straight to the government and there is no revenue risk for Govia, the operator which just receives a management fee for running services.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/10/southern-rail-rmt-union-modernise-ceo-strike\">Southern Rail CEO: our passengers are suffering. The RMT union is to blame | Charles Horton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Therefore, in negotiations with the unions, it is the Department for Transport which is calling the tune rather than the operator, and it is obvious that the government wants an end to the requirement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/southern-trains-crisis-seven-factors-that-threw-services-off-the-rails\" title=\"\">to have a second person on each train</a> on Southern services. The man in charge of franchises, Peter Wilkinson, made it clear in an unusually candid speech back in February that this dispute was intended to be a key moment in changing past practice. He <a href=\"http://www.passengertransport.co.uk/2016/03/wilkinson-wants-hard-line-approach-to-aslef/\" title=\"\">suggested</a> the unions had been featherbedded for too long and needed to be brought under control: \u201cIt has got to change \u2013 we have got to break them. They have all borrowed money to buy cars and got credit cards. They can\u2019t afford to spend too long on strike and I will push them into that place.\u201d</p> <p>Although Govia has said there will still be a second person, it will no longer be the case that this will be mandatory. In other words, services will be able to operate without that second person and there will be nothing to stop a gradual reduction of trains having a customer services person, as they will now be called. That is why both the RMT and the operator/department have locked horns so fiercely in the Southern dispute. The RMT, with some justification, points to a safety risk on making the driver, rather than the guard, operate the doors on very crowded Southern services.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is rather like the reasons underlying the Brexit vote: a general disaffection and giving two fingers to bosses.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The other two potential strikes have the feeling of grandstanding on both sides, and are likely to get resolved. The RMT, which is the union behind all three strike actions, uses militancy as a recruiting tool and is prepared to go to the brink, knowing strikes are costly for employers. It is a tactic that has worked well for years and these two threats of action are just the latest in a long series of similar disputes, most of which get resolved without a walkout.</p> <p>So are we back to the days of the three-day week and strife on the streets? Hardly. The union movement is a busted flush, ground down by technological changes and restrictive legislation, and is characterised by a failure to adapt to 21st century realities. When I talk to senior trade unionists in the transport industry, they are fully aware that they need to change in order to develop an approach that is more in keeping with their strength in today\u2019s world. However, they are often constrained by activists who dominate their conferences and branches and who are more militant than they are. As for the members supporting action, it is rather like the reasons underlying the Brexit vote: a general disaffection and a way of giving two fingers to their bosses. They are weary of being marginalised and no longer being considered in decisions made by management, so they will support action even if they know that it is not over the real issues.</p> <p>These disputes, therefore, are about the wider disaffection of workers with managements who are increasingly out of touch and overpaid. They happen in the transport industry because that is one of the few areas where industrial action can still be effective and forces management to take note. 1973, though, it ain\u2019t.</p> <p>\u2022 Christian Wolmar\u2019s latest book is <a href=\"http://londonpublishingpartnership.co.uk/are-trams-socialist/\" title=\"\">Are Trams Socialist?

  "<p>Your main concerns when you attend a festival might include any of the following: how will I identify my tent at 5am? Is glamping worth it? Will <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7jGXf2NeO8\" title=\"\">Este from Haim do bassface</a>?</p> <p>But one thing you should not have to worry about is: will I get measles?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/08/measles-warning-young-people-festivals-outbreaks\" title=\"\">Public Health England has confirmed</a> a significant number of infections linked to music festivals and other large public events. There have been reports of 38 suspected measles cases at events in June and July alone. Glastonbury had 16 cases, with seven cases reported from the NASS festival near Bristol; six at the Triplicity festival in north Devon; three at Tewkesbury medieval festival; two at Nozstock: the Hidden Valley in Herefordshire; two at Noisily in Leicester; one at the Secret Garden Party near Huntingdon; and one at Yeovil Show.</p> <p>In all, 234 cases have been confirmed between January and June, compared with 54 for the same period last year.</p> <p>Why is this happening now? One possibility is that the Wakefield generation has come of age. The fraudulent study by Andrew Wakefield <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/apr/21/no-link-between-mmr-and-autism-major-study-concludes\" title=\"\">that incorrectly linked the MMR vaccine and autism</a> was published 18 years ago. Although later discredited (with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/may/24/mmr-doctor-andrew-wakefield-struck-off\" title=\"\">Wakefield being struck off the medical register</a>), the rate of vaccination against measles plummeted after the study\u2019s appearance in The Lancet. There were 56 cases of measles the year before its publication in England and Wales; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/nov/29/health-measles-epidemic\" title=\"\">by 2008 there were 1,370</a>.</p> <p>Many parents of the Wakefield era chose not to vaccinate their children and were understandably swayed by breathless media coverage, inconsistent messages from health providers, and apparent validation of Wakefield\u2019s findings by the scientific community; it took The Lancet 12 years to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/feb/02/lancet-retracts-mmr-paper\" title=\"\">retract the publication</a>. If you were the parent of a toddler in those years, what would you have done?</p> <p>Now, those unvaccinated children have grown up. They go to festivals. The virus is so contagious that if one person has it, 90% of those in close contact will also become infected if they are <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/transmission.html\" title=\"\">not immune themselves</a>. And so Public Health England has urged teenagers and adults to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/measles-vaccination-advice-for-young-adults\" title=\"\">check with their GP</a> if they have been vaccinated and to receive two doses of the MMR vaccine if required.</p> <p>The Wakefield-era children also grew up to account for most of the 1,219 measles cases in the Swansea measles epidemic in 2012, in which <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-23168519\" title=\"\">one person died</a>. Although some recovered quickly from <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/CONDITIONS/MEASLES/Pages/Symptoms.aspx\" title=\"\">fever, conjunctivitis and a rash</a>, others suffered more significant complications. <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/\" title=\"\">According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, one or two out of every 1,000 children who become infected with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic sequelae including blindness, seizures and encephalitis. Since 2006, there have been three deaths from measles in England and Wales.</p> <p>This historical legacy is compounded by <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-33774181\" title=\"\">anti-vax</a> sentiment that has become more visible in recent years, albeit not necessarily more widespread. The consequences of this movement travel beyond forums and Facebook posts. It is easy to imagine it to be as infectious as the virus itself, but I think there is a more nuanced subtext, too.</p> <p>Measles arrived at Disneyland, California with one case in December 2014. Within four months, <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6406a5.htm?s_cid=mm6406a5_w\" title=\"\">there were 145 confirmed cases in seven states</a> and three countries, all linked to Disneyland. The authors of an analysis in <a href=\"http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2203906\" title=\"\">JAMA Pediatrics journal</a> said the outbreak was directly associated with substandard vaccination compliance: \u201cThe ongoing measles outbreak linked to the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, shines a glaring spotlight on our nation\u2019s growing anti-vaccination movement and the prevalence of vaccination-hesitant parents.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Vaccination is more than a personal choice; the inaction of others can affect even vaccinated children and adults</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Vaccination is more than a personal choice; the inaction of others can affect even vaccinated children and adults. Community vaccination helps to halt the spread of the virus and thus protects the wider population. The sum is greater than its parts. But here\u2019s what is crucial. Each outbreak is different, there are nuances to each one, and not all can be attributed simplistically to a groundswell of anti-vax sentiment. Swansea is definitely not California.</p> <p>For example, early 2014 cases were linked to unvaccinated travellers returning home who had acquired the virus abroad (an outbreak in the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html\" title=\"\">Philippines was an important factor</a>) and then infected others in communities with <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2014/p0529-measles.html\" title=\"\">lower vaccination rates</a>. Despite the concerns expressed in pockets of unvaccinated residents, there is no nationwide loss of confidence in vaccines. Sometimes it\u2019s a case of missed doctors\u2019 appointments or single vaccines refused rather than staunch dissent. And vaccine refusal does not correlate with a lack of knowledge. Moral outrage is too easy.</p> <p>Julie Leask, an associate professor at Sydney University\u2019s school of public health, <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/jyz2ucy\" title=\"\">provides level-headed discussion on this topic</a>: \u201cTo be committed to the science of immunisation ideally comes with a commitment to the science of immunisation behaviour. Media often present this problem as refusal to vaccinate. But the evidence is clear and it\u2019s more complex: under-vaccination is broadly about a lack of acceptance and a lack of opportunity to vaccinate fully or on time. It\u2019s not just the haves, but the have-nots who don\u2019t fully vaccinate.</p> <p>\u201cA typical measles outbreak will reveal this. There will be children whose parents refused vaccination; children whose parents were unwittingly not up to date for lack of access; affordability or awareness; adults and travellers who didn\u2019t get a needed booster; and babies who are too young to be vaccinated.\u201d</p> <p>So although \u201cfestival measles\u201d seems to largely fit with the coming of age of the Wakefield generation and more particularly a broader anti-vax narrative, it is too simplistic to conclude that this is applicable to all. But it does provide an opportune moment to discuss issues around vaccination, to strengthen public health infrastructure to deliver effective programmes, and to ensure there is never even the possibility of a Wakefield generation occurring again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/08/measles-warning-young-people-festivals-outbreaks\">Measles warning to young people at festivals after series of outbreaks</a> </p> </aside>",

When I graduated from my high school in 1980, teenage girls were being used as messy political weapons by the US\u2019s nascent religious right, to build its power. Our access to birth control, to abortion, and our rights to have sex as freely as young men, became one of the major issues around which the \u201cMoral Majority\u201d organised itself. As a young woman, I wrote articles about <a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/\">Planned Parenthood</a>, I escorted friends to clinics to get contraceptives, but I never talked about my own femaleness.

A woman\u2019s sexual drive is reduced to something animalistic and strange \u2013 think Philip Roth\u2019s Consuela Castillo in The Dying Animal, \u201csuperclassically the fertile female of our mammalian species ... caroming about with her eyes shut, off in a child\u2019s game of her own\u201d. Or revolting and alien, like in Jeffrey Eugenides\u2019s The Virgin Suicides: \u201cHe felt her clammy shins, her hot knees, her bristly thighs, and then with terror he put his finger in the ravenous mouth of the animal leashed below her waist.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, a thread of fascinated revulsion with women runs through Eugenides\u2019s tale of five sisters who all take their own lives over the course of a year. The chorus of adolescent boys who narrate the book remark on the sisters as \u201ccreatures\u201d, the youngest one a \u201cderanged harlot\u201d. Menstruation is elevated to some mysterious blood rite: \u201cIn the trash can was one Tampax spotted, still fresh from the insides of one of the Lisbon sisters. Sissen said that he wanted to bring it to us, that it wasn\u2019t gross but a beautiful thing, you had to see it, like a modern painting or something.\u201d</p> <p>Eugenides is not alone in portraying female puberty as something preternatural; the most iconic example is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/24/rereading-stephen-king-carrie\">Stephen King\u2019s Carrie</a>, when the sheltered Carrie gets her period for the first time and becomes the butt of her schoolmates\u2019 jibes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cPER-iod!\u201d</p> <p>It was becoming a chant, an incantation.

Young women are either the animalistic bearers of the erotic urge, or bodily reminders of how sin enters the world. And other elements of female adolescence not associated with sex \u2013 like the intensity of friendships or familial bonds at that stage of life \u2013 are left off the page, or reduced to dramatic displays of hormonal cattiness.</p> <p>One of the side-effects of locking women, or people of colour, or members of the working class, out of the publication market is that when those people appear in literature written by authors who are not them, they may not recognise themselves. When critics have been schooled to recognise \u201cart\u201d through representations of the status quo, new works from authors outside of that end up classified as \u201clesser\u201d\u2013 think of the genre labels \u201cethnic literature\u201d, \u201cchick lit\u201d, \u201cpopular fiction\u201d. \u201cWatching boys do stuff\u201d is the stuff of literature \u2013 and reading male writers who view women as something alien has been the flipside of that literature for a long time.</p> <p>What a relief it was, then, to read two books this summer in which two female authors wrote about teenage girls doing stuff: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/04/the-best-recent-crime-novels-review-roundup\">Robin Wasserman\u2019s Girls on Fire</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/08/the-girls-by-emma-cline-review-charles-manson\">Emma Cline\u2019s The Girls</a>.

But it was not Cline\u2019s imagining of life inside Manson\u2019s compound that made me squirm, it was the evocation of the mother-daughter relationship that made me want to call my own mother and apologise.

  "<p>Night owls in the northern hemisphere could be in for a treat this Thursday night/Friday morning. The annual Perseid meteor shower reaches its peak on the night of 11\u201312 August, and this year it is predicted to give double its usual rate of meteors. </p> <p>Up to 200 shooting stars per hour could be seen under perfect conditions, <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/watchtheskies/perseid-meteor-shower-aug11-12.html\">according to Bill Cooke</a> of Nasa\u2019s Meteoroid Environments Office in Huntsville, Alabama. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.imo.net/\">International Meteor Organization</a> goes as far as wondering whether this week\u2019s spectacle is going to be \u201cthe best in years\u201d. The optimism is being driven by two reasons.</p> <p>Firstly, the moon will set soon after midnight bringing full darkness to the sky and allowing even faint meteors to be seen. Secondly, Earth may encounter a denser than normal part of the meteor stream.</p> <p>Meteors are dust grains that burn up in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. They were once part of a comet\u2019s tail, shed under the influence of the sun\u2019s heat. As the tail dissipates the dust remains in the comet\u2019s orbit for centuries or even millennia. If Earth happens to pass through this dust stream, we experience a meteor shower.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/gallery/2015/aug/13/perseid-meteor-shower-in-pictures\">Perseid meteor shower \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Perseid meteors all come from comet Swift-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every 133 years. According to calculations made by French astronomer Jeremy Vaubaillon, this week the Earth could pass through a dense patch of meteors that were ejected by the comet in the year AD 1079.</p> <p>Perseid meteors tend to be fast and bright. They hit the Earth\u2019s atmosphere at speeds of 59 kilometres <em>per second</em>. This creates a shock wave in front of the meteor that naturally becomes hot because the air is being rapidly compressed. The temperature reaches thousands of degrees and burns up the dust grain, giving the bright flash of light.</p> <p>To watch for the meteors, also known as shooting stars, find somewhere as far away from streetlights as possible. Choose a spot with a good view of the sky, away from tall trees or buildings. Wear plenty of clothes as even in the summer, nighttime temperatures can be low. Take a blanket to lie on the ground, or a desk chair, and look towards the northeast.</p> <p>No equipment is needed, your eyes are the best things for spotting the fleeting meteors. The best time to look is in the early hours of Friday morning, after the Moon has set and the constellation of Perseus has risen higher in the northeast. The Perseids are so-called because they appear to emanate from the constellation Perseus.</p> <p>Usually 50-100 meteors per hour are expected from the Perseids, but this year up to 200 per hour could be possible. The last time the shower reached these proportions was in 2004.</p> <p>Occasionally individual Perseids can explode, becoming fireballs. These are highly prized among meteor watchers because of the spectacle they offer.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.stuartclark.com/\"><em>Stuart Clark</em></a><em> is the author of </em><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Search-Earths-Twin-Stuart-Clark/dp/1848665822\">The Search for Earth\u2019s Twin</a></em><em> (Quercus), and co-host of the podcast </em><a href=\"https://www.acast.com/stuniverse\"><em>The Stuniverse</em></a><em> (Bingo Productions).</em></p>",

  "<p>An MP in Israel has proposed a new law that would shield the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, from any future criminal investigation while in office.</p> <p>The law, proposed by the Likud MP David Amsalem, the Knesset\u2019s interior committee chairman, was greeted with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Opposition-outraged-by-bill-exempting-PM-from-probes-of-minor-offenses-463622\">an outcry from opposition MPs</a>.</p> <p>Last month the Israeli attorney general <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/10/inquiry-ordered-into-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu\">launched a preliminary inquiry</a> into \u201cmatters relating to Netanyahu\u201d, without saying what those matters were. The Israeli prime minister, who has previously faced scrutiny on his household spending, denies any wrongdoing.</p> <p></p> <p>Amsalem originally suggested that the law should only cover minor offences carrying a prison sentence up to six months, but later proposed that more serious crimes should also included.</p> <p>\u201cI have asked my legal adviser to redraft the bill so that it will also apply to all offences falling under the rubric of public morality, including bribe-taking,\u201d Amsalem said. </p> <p>\u201cFor the past 30 years, there hasn\u2019t been a single prime minister who wasn\u2019t busy with investigations,\u201d Amsalem wrote on his Facebook page explaining his reasoning. \u201cThe prime minister holds the most important job in Israel.

[and] cannot be preoccupied by investigations practically every day.\u201d</p> <p>Amsalem added that the timing of his proposal was unconnected to current criminal allegations against Netanyahu. </p> <p>\u201cThe timing of the bill is irrelevant. In our country at any given moment a covert investigation is going on against a prime minister.

A Likud party spokesman said it had not been coordinated with Netanyahu\u2019s office. </p> <p>Opposition MPs said no citizen should be above the law and pointed out that investigations into the Israeli prime minister required permission from the country\u2019s attorney general in any case, a move designed to prevent tendentious inquiries.</p>",
  "<p>Precious metal miners are attracting attention and not jus because of a continuing rise in the gold and silver prices as investors seek havens for their cash.</p> <p>The sector has also been lifted by positive results from Egyptian gold miner <strong>Centamin</strong>. The company lifted its production guidance for the year from 470,000 ounces to between 520,000 and 540,000 ounces thanks to increased output from its Sukari mine. It also reported a jump in second quarter profits from $37.3m to $101.6m. Analysts at Canaccord Genuity said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Centamin reported seocond quarter and first half earnings that exceeded our forecasts \u2013 this was a strong set of results. The company had already recently reported second quarter gold production of 140,300 ounces from the Sukari mine, up 12% on the first quarter, making 265,600 ounces for the first half, up 23% from 216,000 ounces in the first half of 2015. Gold sales for the first half were 265,500 ounces. The key stand out, however, was a very strong performance in cost control, with the benefit from operational cost efficiencies and lower fuel costs exceeding our forecasts. </p> <p>This is an extremely strong result, and management is clearly managing to successfully optimise the operations at Sukari.

The latest quarterly results confirmed our thesis that Randgold continues to be priced for perfection and the risks to achieving production guidance set at the start of the year cannot be ignored. We appreciate the need for gold exposure but following the exceptional re-rating that has taken place this year, we now struggle to see significant upside ahead from the current market valuation. </p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>Do you trust the private sector? No? Neither do I. But I also know that we have to find a way to overcome the knee-jerk reaction that all private sector is bad, and all public sector is good. Because nowhere in the world do we have (or, in the main, want) a situation where we have all markets or all states delivering what we need.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/aug/14/i-quit-my-development-job-and-ate-some-humble-pie-this-is-what-i-learned\">I quit my development job and ate some humble pie: this is what I learned</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My inherent cynicism isn\u2019t without evidence: there is an endless list of corporate wrongdoing in the developing world. The private sector has different incentives from the public or NGO sector and markets don\u2019t necessarily reward good behaviour. Indeed, quite often, at least in the short-term, they offer the strongest incentives for those who can find ways to cut standards and lower costs, exploiting anyone and everything in their wake.</p> <p>But nonetheless, I still think its time to get beyond the rhetoric. The arguments have hardly changed in fifteen years, and, quite frankly, I\u2019m bored. The lines are pitched as an argument between the pragmatists and the idealists: those who partner with the private sector, and those who campaign against them. On the one side, you get <a href=\"https://www.devex.com/news/the-power-of-collaboration-6-success-factors-for-private-ngo-partnerships-86366\">Care\u2019s partnership with Cargill</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/barbara-frost/clean-water_b_10923698.html\">Wateraid\u2019s partnership with Diageo</a>. For this camp, collaborating with the private sector is perceived as necessary and inevitable. Governments have failed people, they might say, and NGOs can\u2019t deliver to scale. Putting a private-sector lens to the challenge of development has brought innovation and the newly worn phrase \u201cdisruption\u201d to a tired industry. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Private-sector led development will be Priti Patel's calling card</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For others, however \u2013 let\u2019s call them the idealists \u2013 private sector-led development removes people\u2019s rights and individual freedoms, while further embedding corporate control of everything. For this camp, NGOs who partner with the private sector have undermined our mutual, long-term cause.</p> <p>The pragmatists are certainly more in favour with the government of the day. The UK\u2019s Department for International Development (DfID)\u2019s new minister, Priti Patel, the former tobacco lobbyist who once wanted to axe the entire department, will continue the priorities already set by her predecessor. Private-sector led development will be her calling card, and collaborations between NGOs and the private sector will be at an even greater premium. Any NGO wanting a future funding relationship with DfID will be expected to tow the line. They were already giving roughly a third of their budget away to the private sector or private sector partnerships with NGOs. This could easily rise.</p> <p>The idealist in me is concerned. Development agendas centred around rights and freedoms have been taking a back seat to the business of economic development \u2013 the pragmatists seem to have won. DfID\u2019s statement of purpose says, among other things: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development/about\">\u201cwe\u2019re ending the need for aid by creating jobs\u201d</a> as if development were just a matter of employment. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/23/developing-poor-countries-de-develop-rich-countries-sdgs\">Forget 'developing' poor countries, it's time to 'de-develop' rich countries</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So who is right? The pragmatists or the idealists? Are those who eschew private-sector partnerships just ideologues, blind to modern realities? Or has the NGO sector really sold out to the highest bidder, throwing their ideals out the window?</p> <p>It\u2019s worth pointing out that in roughly the same period as we\u2019ve seen a rise of private-sector led development, we\u2019ve also seen some worrying trends: rising levels of inequality over the past 15 years, more insecure work, environmental degradation and tax evasion on a massive scale. NGOs who enter into partnerships are clearly not to blame for these outcomes, but should we be asking: have they aided and abetted their rise, concentrating power into the hands of the wealthy?</p> <p>Frustratingly, it\u2019s not that simple. Moral clarity makes campaigning easier, but as Duncan Green pointed out to me recently: NGOs, even more radical ones, spend a lot more time working with the private sector than they care to admit. \u201cSmall farmers and SMEs or cooperatives are as important a part of the private sector \u2013 if not more so \u2013 than big irrelevant corporations,\u201d he said. We need to reframe this debate, he argued: it\u2019s not about private v public, but about size, scale, and form.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jul/07/sdgs-progress-stay-humble\">We won't conquer the mountains of the SDGs without humility</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The crux of the matter is the relevant role of NGOs. A DfID model sees NGOs as just one vehicle to deliver economic growth, to help raise standards in the private sector or to provide some basic services to the poor. Where NGOs sing, however, is in their ability to challenge unfair structures, not to pander to them. Can NGOs really be both partner, and provocateur? Instead of bringing influence and innovation, have relationships with the private sector rendered NGOs role as advocate, watchdog and change agent, marginalised and ineffective?</p> <p>Sunita Narain, the chief executive of India\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.cseindia.org/\">Centre for Science and the Environment</a>, speaking recently at the Institute of Development Studies\u2019 50th anniversary conference, said that many in development believe that over the past period, we\u2019ve empowered society through the growth of the market. Instead, she asked us provocatively: \u201cWhich society? The poor or the rich?\u201d</p> <p>If private sector-led development, and the partnerships it brings, can be about genuine power shifts, then I would shout from the rooftops. But for now, that small, cooperative private sector that Green refers to is hidden in the shadows, lacking power and toothless. Most NGOs will continue to take big corporate cash, while holding their critical tongues of dissent. All private sector development is certainly not bad \u2013 but the type of private-sector led development, I fear, that Patel foresees, is far from this type of genuine shift.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

They were also renamed to Austria Memphis in 1977.

Two: thousands of the city\u2019s jobs were, as a direct result, dependent on the Aura cigarette factory. No similarly mitigating circumstances justify the ubiquitous sponsorship of top-flight UK clubs by betting/payday-loan sharks.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I attended a FK Sarajevo match back in the day, I had a flashback of a \u2018Billy the Fish\u2019 cartoon from Viz, in which the advertising hoardings showed two messages side by side: \u2018Smoke tabs\u2019 and \u2018Government Health Warning: Don\u2019t Smoke Tabs\u2019.

It wasn\u2019t until 2009 that the pesky anti-smoking brigade finally managed to bring in a law against tobacco advertising. So the league is now sponsored by the leading national brand of beer instead. Ho hum! Mustang did manage to squeeze in a shirt sponsorship before their scheme ran out of puff, when during a six-month period in 2002, the brand graced the kits of <a href=\"http://www.futbolred.com/contenido/liga-aguila/noticias/fecha12015/IMAGEN/IMAGEN-15156655-2.png\">Millonarios FC</a> (that\u2019s the Millonarios of Di Stefano and Goycochea fame).\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, sponsorship in Indonesia led to some very oddly named competitions. \u201cIndonesian football (sadly) has a very close relationship with the tobacco industry,\u201d writes Adi Prasatya. \u201cWhen our pro league system was rebooted in the mid-90s, the league\u2019s main sponsor was Bentoel, a local tobacco giant. The inaugural season in 1994 was named \u2018Liga Dunhill\u2019, a cigarette brand distributed by Bentoel. As part of the sponsorship deal, all clubs must put the Dunhill logo in front of their shirts.</p> <p>\u201cDunhill lasted for two seasons, and for the third season Bentoel used the league to hawk their Kansas-brand cigarettes, which resulted in the ridiculously named Liga Kansas \u2013 no relation whatsoever with the heartland of America. Bentoel has since been acquired by the British American Tobacco. The league is no longer sponsored by the tobacco industry, but their grip on the football scene remains strong. You cannot watch a football game on TV without seeing a cigarette ad.\u201d</p> <p>But the relationship was not all one way.

The only goal was scored by future Manchester United tub Anderson, while Nautico missed two penalties. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batalha_dos_Aflitos\">You can read more about it here</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9eiMu-D78Y\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/F9eiMu-D78Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>Knowledge archive</strong></h2> <p><strong>\u201cOn-loan Manchester United midfielder Jesse Lingard has just scored four goals on his debut for Birmingham,\u201d </strong>wrote Jon Porter-Hughes in 2013. <strong>\u201cHas there ever been a more prolific debutant?\u201d</strong></p> <p>It turns out that high-scoring debuts are not quite so uncommon as you would think: just the month before, there was at least a hat-trick of players who scored hat-tricks on their debuts. Fredy Montero, for instance, on loan from Seattle Sounders, scored three as Sporting Lisbon beat FC Arouca 5-1. In the Bundesliga, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang marked his debut for Borussia Dortmund with three goals in a 4-0 win against Augsburg, and not a scuffer among them. In the Eredivisie, meanwhile, Zakaria Bakkali started life at PSV\u2019s Philips Stadion with a trio of goals against NEC Nijmegen (and funnily enough, another PSV player, J\u00fcrgen Locadia, scored a hat-trick on his league debut last season).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/20/footballers-playing-in-major-international-finals-after-club-relegations\">Footballers playing in major international finals after club relegations | The Knowledge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They add their names to a list that includes the likes of Fabrizio Ravenelli, who put three past Liverpool on his Middlesbrough debut at the start of the 1996-97 season (by the way, John Barnes\u2019s goal in that game is delightful); Wayne Rooney, who scored three against Fenerbahce on his Manchester United debut nine years ago, and none of them from closer than 18 yards; and Alan Shearer, who had previously come on as a sub for Southampton but made his full debut against Arsenal and scored three of the four goals that secured Southampton victory in April 1988. It made him the youngest player ever to score a top-flight hat-trick.</p> <p>These three-goal slackers obviously didn\u2019t match Lingard\u2019s feat, but there are those who have. Earlier in 2013, as the German club Energie Cottbus began their pre-season schedule, Charles Takyi made his debut in a 17-1 drubbing of Mullroser and scored four goals before being replaced at half-time. Perhaps it doesn\u2019t really count, but for the sake of completeness, you should also know about Patrick Weihrauch, who was \u2013 at the time of writing \u2013 yet to play a competitive match for Bayern Munich but scored four when he played in their sharpener against a Wildenau Weiden Fans XI. And while we\u2019re on training matches, we ought to nod to Emmanuel Ake, who stayed in Denmark in February 2012 just about long enough to score five goals on debut for Svebolle, who beat Frederiksberg 7-4 that day.</p> <p>Flicking back through the archives, we found a few further examples, all of them from bona fide competitive matches to boot. First to St James\u2019 Park, where on the first day of the 1989-90 season Micky Quinn, top scorer for relegated Portsmouth the season before, marked his arrival with four goals in Newcastle\u2019s 5-2 win over Leeds United. The visitors actually took a 2-1 lead after Quinn had opened the scoring from the penalty spot, but the tide turned in the second half. The crowd were beside themselves by the time Quinn ran through an exposed Leeds defence to slot his fourth past Mervyn Day. \u201cOh my word, it\u2019s that man Quinn again!\u201d This would become a recurring phrase that season, as Quinn scored 34 league goals and 39 in all competitions.</p> <p>Now to Turf Moor, January 1957, where a 17-year-old Ian Lawson was about to make his debut for Burnley in an FA Cup third-round match against Chesterfield. Within four minutes of kick-off, Lawson had given Burnley the lead and with the last kick of the game he scored his fourth to round off a thumping 7-0 win. In the next round, by the way, Burnley beat New Brighton 9-0, with Lawson scoring another three.<br></p> <p>And, finally, all the way back to November 1934, where Arthur Milne celebrated his move from Brechin Vics to Dundee United with four goals in United\u2019s 9-6 league win over Edinburgh City. In his three years at the club he scored 85 goals in 81 games.</p> <p><em>\u2022 For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/theknowledge\">the Knowledge archive</a>.</em></p> <h2>Can you help?</h2> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/05/the-joy-of-six-sporting-pitch-fiascos\">The recent Joy of Six regarding pitches</a> reminded me of a story when Wales where playing a friendly against Brazil and narrowed the pitch before the game to counter the threat of the Brazilian wingers.

The root cause of this problem lies in its intransigent and self-interested attitude towards small but important reforms we\u2019re making to working practices that will improve the punctuality of our services and enhance customer service on trains.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/southern-rail-strike-war-of-words-heats-up-on-second-day\">Southern rail strike: day two of commuter misery amid war of words</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Passenger numbers on Britain\u2019s railways are soaring. <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2015/06/05/there-are-now-70-more-people-on-britains-trains-but-services-have-dropped-5231442/\" title=\"\">They\u2019ve gone up 70% </a>in little over a decade. To accommodate this, we cannot stay the same. We must invest, and we must change how we work. At the same time, in all walks of life, people\u2019s expectations of customer service are much higher than a generation ago. Industries such as retail have changed radically in response to rising customer expectations. But on the railways we are often slow to change. But we must, and it should start now.</p> <p>We\u2019re investing hugely in new trains with greater capacity and changing the old role of the conductor so that they no longer close the doors \u2013 a task that passes to the driver. In fact, the driver already does this on 40% of our trains and has done so for up to 25 years. So what we are doing is nothing radical or new. All we are doing is extending this proven way of working.</p> <p>No one is losing their job. No one is getting a pay cut. And let\u2019s be absolutely clear \u2013 just as many trains will have a second member of staff on board as do today. Freed from operating the doors, they will be moving through the trains offering the highly visible and direct customer service passengers want. We\u2019ll also equip them with new technology so they can offer passengers up-to-date information about services, tickets and onward travel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e28910eecac4fb3bafad71bef676099d457bf6da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e28910eecac4fb3bafad71bef676099d457bf6da/0_34_3696_4615/801.jpg\" alt=\"Passengers on a Southern service departing from London Victoria station during strike action.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>RMT claims that this way of running trains is unsafe, yet offer not one shred of evidence to this effect. RMT members have been safely operating trains this way for decades, and we have these driver-operated doors already on 2,000 services daily. Recently the rail industries\u2019 independent rail safety board has confirmed that drivers fully controlling the doors might even be safer than having conductors also involved in the task.</p> <p>That such a change is causing the RMT to unleash such misery on passengers is mystifying. Some have suggested the real reason for its disproportionate reaction is that it fears a loss of its own power and control, and want to maintain its ability to stop services.</p> <p>Last week, we spent three days at <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/acas\" title=\"\">Acas</a> trying to find a deal to avoid this strike and tabled a comprehensive eight-point compromise plan. The deal guaranteed jobs and guaranteed that we would continue to roster staff on to every train that we do at present. But the RMT dismissed the plan, condemning hundreds of thousands of our customers to another week of travel hardship.</p> <p>So far this week the strike timetable is running as well as can be expected. The strike means we have 40% fewer trains running every day, of those trains we are able to provide 90% are on time.</p> <p>Significantly, we are also seeing conductors themselves begin to \u201cvote with their feet\u201d and return to work in defiance of the RMT. On the first day of the strike around one in five conductors came to work anyway. I thank those men and women who have demonstrated their commitment to serving our passengers, and commend their courage in standing up for what they believe in.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The hard-working railway men and women of Britain are being led astray by a trade union acting in its own interests</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The railway men and women of Britain are overwhelmingly diligent and hard-working, and they care deeply about the rail service they provide. But they are being led astray, and misled repeatedly, by a trade union acting in its own narrow, selfish interests and ignoring the interests of either commuters or its members. The deal we offered protects RMT members\u2019 jobs, by giving them a vital task the railway will always need, rather than one being rendered redundant by new technology.</p> <p>This week\u2019s strike must be the last. Southern needs to restore to passengers the service they rightly demand. So the RMT faces a clear choice: it can either be part of the problem, or it can be part of the solution. We have said we will have talks with the union \u201cany time, any place, anywhere\u201d and I hope we can sit around the table again soon and sort this out once and for all. I know what every Southern passenger would want them to do. This has to stop, and stop now.</p>",

  "<p>We love a good counterfactual, don\u2019t we? They are a&#xa0;bit of fun, in which we tweak history\u2019s nose by imagining what might have been. Even Edward Gibbon did it in <em>The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</em>, when he speculated what might have happened had Frankish ruler Charles Martel not defeated the Moors in 732: \u201cPerhaps the interpretations of the Koran would now be taught in the schools of Oxford, and her pulpits might demonstrate to a circumcised people the sanctity and truth of the revelation of Mohammed.\u201d</p> <p>That is nose-tweaking with a vengeance \u2013 and as Professor Evans points out, it was also a dig at Oxford, where Gibbon had spent \u201cwhat he called the most idle, and the most unprofitable years of his life\u201d. But Evans disapproves of the current trend for counterfactuals, and arrives like a stern&#xa0;teacher to&#xa0;break up the frolics of naughty schoolchildren. And once his argument hits its stride he makes a very good case.</p> <p>It is interesting to be reminded that so many of the historians who go in for&#xa0;this kind of thing (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/niall-ferguson\" title=\"\">Niall Ferguson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/13/napoleon-the-great-andrew-roberts-review\" title=\"\">Andrew Roberts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/norman-stone\" title=\"\">Norman Stone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/apr/18/historybooks.features1\" title=\"\">Adam Zamoyski</a> and, earlier, JC Squire, a notable literary figure of the interwar period, along with the contributors to his 1931 volume <em>If It Had Happened Otherwise)</em> are rightwingers. The first&#xa0;chapter of <em>Altered Pasts</em> is called \u201cWishful Thinking\u201d, and you can begin to feel distinctly queasy when you notice how many counterfactual histories describe a reality in which the British empire never declined or, even worse, where Hitler had won the second world war.</p> <p>It is notable how many counterfactualists tend to be Eurosceptics, or&#xa0;deeply suspicious of anything that might come to be a federal Europe; in&#xa0;his chapter on counterfactuals in fiction, Evans notes that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/video/2012/apr/02/robert-harris-fatherland-video\" title=\"\">Robert Harris\u2019s <em>Fatherland</em></a> \u2013 which may be regarded as the modern counterfactual novel <em>par excellence</em> \u2013 is steeped in a distrust of Europe. I must admit I missed this aspect of the book, but in my defence, I was just after an undemanding holiday read at the time.</p> <p>Evans has his sights trained most firmly on Ferguson, who edited the 1997 essay collection <em>Virtual Histories</em>, which reinvigorated the genre. Ferguson, Evans explains, not only shows his hand too clearly in his introduction and own contribution (the Royalists winning the English civil war, etc), but contradicts his own anti-determinism. Counterfactualism\u2019s practitioners prefer great people and events to broad trends, but Ferguson is determinist when it suits him \u2013 when it comes to the causes of the first world war, for instance. Evans\u2019s undermining of Ferguson is all the more convincing because he gives Ferguson a good deal of credit and respect before shooting him down. You cannot be a responsible historian, he says, while&#xa0;ignoring the \u201clengthy chain of causation\u201d that history is about and \u201cthe strong degree of arbitrariness in such speculations\u201d in the first place.</p> <p>The trick, then, is to avoid being too&#xa0;serious about it, and not to let&#xa0;your thinking be guided by the bees in your bonnet. (Catholics imagining a&#xa0;world without the Reformation \u2013 that\u2019s&#xa0;another popular train of thought.) Evans cites with great approval the \u201cWhat If ...\u201d columns written by <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/writers/317764\" title=\"\">Dominic Sandbrook for the New Statesman</a> between 2009 and 2011. These were some of my favourite bits of the magazine, in which his counter-historical musings were the basis of hugely amusing gags, such as when the&#xa0;descendants of Oliver Cromwell, \u201cPraise-God\u201d and \u201cEd\u201d Cromwell contest the leadership of the Labour party; when Sir George Harrison, in a Beatles-less world, becomes a plutocratic curry&#xa0;magnate; and the speculation that&#xa0;ends: \u201cThe beret and the polo neck remain essential components of English national dress, p\u00e9tanque is still&#xa0;our national sport and, above all, everybody loves a mime artist. What a&#xa0;tragedy for England it would have been&#xa0;if Henry V had died young.\u201d That is the way to go about it: not to treat the genre as a way of fantasising about&#xa0;the removal of your grievances.

  "<p>Scores of seals loll on the riverbank of the Stour, snorting and bellyflopping as they sun themselves a couple of miles outside Ramsgate\u2019s busy marina.<br></p> <p>Far from exceptional, these are just a smattering of the hundreds of seals that the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) hopes to count this week in the Greater Thames estuary. The mammals are sighted as far up as Teddington Lock, and <a href=\"http://sites.zsl.org/inthethames/#Public sightings\">Canary Wharf is a hotspot for seeing them</a>.<br></p> <p>A total of 905 common and grey seals were found along the estuary last year, up from 708 during the first survey in 2013, counted from plane, boat and on foot. ZSL\u2019s spotters take advantage of the seals\u2019 moulting season in August, when they shuffle up sandbanks to shed their coat and grow a new one, making double-counting less likely.<br></p> <p>But while experts have celebrated the rise of the seals along the Thames, there are fears this year of a triple threat to these marine predators.<br></p> <p>Several miles south-east off the coast from Ramsgate is Goodwin Sands, a sort of \u201cspaghetti junction\u201d for seals to haul out after travelling from Europe. It is here that the port of Dover hopes to dredge for sand to expand its operations, a move opposed by many local people and environmentalists.<br></p> <p>Joanna Barker, ZSL\u2019s conservation scientist, said she was concerned at the potential impact, after 75% of last year\u2019s grey seals were counted there. \u201cI think, and many other scientists think, it could be quite an important meeting point for seals coming from mainland Europe because it\u2019s one of most eastern sandbanks of its type.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe are a bit worried about the impact on seals. We would like to see the dredging \u2013 if it does take place \u2013 it doesn\u2019t take place in important times in seal biology. We wouldn\u2019t want to see dredging in the pupping [breeding] times.\u201d<br></p> <p>A petition has attracted nearly 10,000 signatures and last month actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/05/mark-rylance-backs-campaign-to-stop-dredging-off-kent-coast-save-our-sands\">Mark Rylance backed a campaign against the dredging of the sandbanks</a>, which have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/19/dredging-proposed-kent-marine-conservation-zone-risk\">proposed for designation as a marine conservation zone</a>.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0f4a95b18487c83d6a423700dc66aca28306135\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0f4a95b18487c83d6a423700dc66aca28306135/0_0_2154_1292/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A total of 905 common and grey species were counted along the estuary last year from Deal in Kent to in Lowestoft in Suffolk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A total of 905 common and grey species were counted along the estuary last year from Deal in Kent to in Lowestoft in Suffolk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are also concerns over a repeat of an outbreak of a deadly virus which wiped out thousands of seals in 1988 and 2002. Phocene distemper virus has been <a href=\"http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Document.aspx?Document=WM0301_5242_FRP.pdf\">described by government scientists</a> as one of the largest and most high-profile animal disease epidemics to have hit indigenous British wildlife.<br></p> <p>Barker said the apparent 14-year cycle suggested it could emerge again in 2016, though ZSL\u2019s fourth count so far has found no evidence yet in the estuary. One sign of human influence is the occasional \u201crusty seal\u201d among the common seals here \u2013 iron oxide in the water has turned their fur orange.<br></p> <p>Close to Ramsgate, these common seals are unfazed by daytrippers cruising by on boats, while those out at more remote sandbanks would take flight if humans approached. However, the common seals may have more to worry about from the much larger greys.<br></p> <p>Weighing up to 300kg, there is an increasing body of evidence that grey seals are spurning their usual diet of 8kg of fish a day and instead preying on both common seals and harbour porpoises.<br></p> <p>Video captured last year appeared to show a grey seal <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/grey-seal-eats-harbour-porpoise-5485690\">eating a harbour porpoise off the coast of Pembrokeshire</a>, while one study <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/26/grey-seals-identified-as-killers-behind-mystery-harbour-porpoise-deaths\">laid the blame for a series of mystery porpoise deaths off the Dutch coast on greys</a>. Researchers last year <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/02/150203-seals-porpoises-hunting-predators-animals-science/\">published photographs of a grey killing a common seal in 2013</a>.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a03d25053893d07c9307efa2e3074818195c68e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a03d25053893d07c9307efa2e3074818195c68e4/28_0_2290_1374/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scientists are concerned grey seals are preying on common seals.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scientists are concerned grey seals are preying on common seals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Greys also eat so much that they could be taking common seals\u2019 dinner. \u201cGrey seals are much bigger than harbour seals, they are really ferocious predators. They could outcompete the harbour seal due to their size at haul-out sites but also by eating a lot of their prey,\u201d said Barker.</p> <p>While the ZSL surveys have found common seal populations in the area to be relatively stable, the number of greys has increased dramatically, she said. The 2015 survey recorded 451 common seals and 454 grey seals in the estuary, versus around 500 of the former and 200 of the latter in 2013.<br></p> <p>The results of the 2016 survey will be out in a few weeks, but in the meantime there is the practical work of counting them. Earlier in the morning, Barker flew around the estuary, tallying them on paper from the air, and taking photos to double check later with colleagues.<br></p> <p>On the Stour, she tots up 72 common and two greys, before passing a grey chewing on a huge fish in the marina as her afternoon\u2019s seal spotting draws to a close.</p>",

  "<p>Summer can be a tricky time for small business owners. Even though the sun is out and dispositions become sunnier as a result, businesses can feel the strain as a greater number of employees inevitably go away on holiday. </p> <p>The summer season also creates some problematic, and sometimes awkward, employee issues. For example, how do you deal with an employee who wears inappropriately skimpy shorts to the office, or someone with bad body odour which is causing complaints from their colleagues? With the Olympics taking place, how do you speak to a colleague who keeps sneaking out of the office to watch events on their phone? </p> <p>As a small business owner, chances are you have to deal with human resources issues solo, without a dedicated professional to help you out. This can be difficult and is often one of the hardest things an employer has to deal with. </p> <p>Often a tricky issue with an employee can be solved with one, albeit awkward, conversation. However, playing one of these conversations wrong could be costly, with a disgruntled member of staff more likely to bring legal action against their employer if they feel they have been discriminated against. Alternatively, an employee could work less effectively if they feel upset as a result of a miscalculated conversation with their boss, or they could start to look for another job. Here\u2019s my advice for handling these tricky conversations.</p> <p><strong>Make sure your policies are in place and up-to-date</strong></p> <p>It can be difficult to ask your employee to stop wearing a low cut dress if there\u2019s no uniform policy. Having a formal document to refer to should make the conversation easier and more straightforward \u2013 the member of staff should find it hard to argue with an official policy that is applied consistently across the workforce.</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t pass the buck</strong></p> <p>Often, inappropriate behaviour will be brought to light through other employees\u2019 complaints. It\u2019s usually not appropriate nor necessary to share this information with your staff member. If they know it\u2019s a problem for their colleagues they\u2019re more likely to be upset or act in a hostile manner.</p> <p><strong>Be prepared before you start the conversation</strong></p> <p>Don\u2019t go into these sorts of chats purely based on the observations of others \u2013 you never know, these could be based on a vendetta against the individual. </p> <p><strong>Think about body language<br></strong></p> <p>Be positive. Smiling encouragingly, and nodding your head can be really simple ways to reassure an employee you\u2019re listening and to make the conversation easier for all concerned.</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t get emotional</strong></p> <p>In these awkward conversations, emotions can run high. It is important that, as the employer, you don\u2019t get upset or angry, even if the employee starts hurling around insults or accusations. Control the conversation, discuss the issue and agree next steps. </p> <p><strong>Be mindful</strong></p> <p>Addressing personal issues, such as an employee\u2019s body odour, is something HR personnel and business owners worry about the most. Rehearse what you want to say before you sit down with the employee. Bear in mind that although the issue of bad body odour may seem unpleasant in the office and a source of complaints from other employees, it may indicate a bigger problem, so it\u2019s best not to joke about it. It could be linked to the employee\u2019s wellbeing \u2013 they may not be looking after themselves because of problems at home, or even have a medical condition that is causing it. Take the problem seriously and deal with it sensitively.</p> <p>Talking to an employee about a sensitive personal issue can be one of the hardest things about being an owner/manager of an SME. Not ignoring issues and ensuring problems are dealt with swiftly and sensitively can make sure a sweary colleague, or one with poor personal hygiene, doesn\u2019t turn into a major business headache.<br></p> <p><em></em></p> <p><strong>Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/small-business/\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox</strong></p>",

Well, if that\u2019s the price you have to pay for a talented but erratic winger when frankly you have other concerns in your squad, then that\u2019s the price you have to pay. Apparently <strong>Oumar Niasse</strong> will be heading to Palace as part of the deal, which invites the question of who found it more difficult to keep a straight face: Palace when they quoted \u00a330m, or Everton when they suggested chucking Niasse into the deal?

  "<p>Paul Ryan, the Republican party\u2019s most senior elected official, has survived an insurgent challenge in his own backyard from an outsider candidate dubbed a \u201cmini-Donald Trump\u201d.</p> <p>The US House speaker comprehensively beat maverick businessman Paul Nehlen in Tuesday\u2019s Republican primary in Wisconsin\u2019s 1st congressional district.</p> <p>Ryan, who did not accept Nehlen\u2019s challenge to a debate during the campaign, told reporters in Janesville on Tuesday night: \u201cWe knew we were going to do well. The outcome is exactly what we were hoping for and what we were expecting. Desperate candidates do desperate things for attention and I think that\u2019s what we saw here.\u201d</p> <p>Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: \u201cCongratulations to my friend Paul Ryan on a well-earned victory. Speaker Ryan\u2019s commitment to faithfully representing the people of Wisconsin and making the case for conservatism have never changed, and his years of principled public service make him a trusted leader in our party.\u201d<br></p> <p>Jeb Bush tweeted his support for Ryan, saying: \u201cWisconsin Republicans rewarded strong, principled leadership today.

The presidential nominee stirred party tensions further when he initially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/02/donald-trump-paul-ryan-john-mccain-re-election-endorsements\">declined to endorse</a> 46-year-old Ryan.</p> <p>But Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/donald-trump-endorses-paul-ryan-wisconsin-rally\">finally gave in to pressure</a> and gave his endorsement last Friday at a rally from which Nehlen was barred.</p> <p>In reality Nehlen was always a long shot trying to pull off one of the biggest upsets of the century. Indeed Trump himself struggled to make an impact in Wisconsin, where he was soundly beaten by Ted Cruz in the Republican primaries. He lost the 1st congressional district by 19 percentage points.</p> <p>But Nehlen, 47, did win the backing of some prominent conservative figures including former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. Rightwing commentator Ann Coulter campaigned for him.</p> <p>Nehlen was likened to Trump as he shared or took further some of the nominee\u2019s controversial positions. He called for the building of a wall along the Mexican border and suggested the deportation of \u201csharia-compliant\u201d Muslims. He criticised Ryan over trade, branding him a \u201csoulless globalist\u201d and promising to \u201crepatriate\u201d jobs to America.</p> <p>Nehlen, an executive at a water filtration company, made a web video of himself riding a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, showing his tattooed arms. He challenged Ryan to an arm-wrestling match if he refused to debate him. He also had the backing of veterans of the Tea Party movement.</p> <p>But all this proved futile against Ryan\u2019s strong local base and to local commentators the result was never in doubt. Ryan was first elected in 1998 and this is his first re-election win since becoming speaker in 2015. He out-raised the unknown Nehlen by a 17-to-1 ratio through the latest finance reporting period and shored up his position with TV ads, radio interviews and campaign stops.</p> <p>Ryan hosted a low-key, 10-minute press conference without a balloon or champagne bottle in sight at an events venue called The Armory.<br></p> <p>Across the street, the ornately decorated Monterey Hotel \u2013 which opened in 1929 and hosted John F Kennedy, Eleanor Roosevelt and Louis Armstrong \u2013 stands abandoned and boarded up. Janesville and other cities in the district have suffered decades of industrial decline and manufacturing job losses which, in theory, should have been fertile territory for a Trump disciple railing against global trade.<br></p> <p>But Nehlen failed to gain traction, with Ryan on course to gain about three-quarters of the votes cast. Asked if the broader lesson of Nehlen\u2019s thrashing is that Trump himself is doomed in the presidential election, Ryan replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think it means he\u2019s doomed in November. I think it means right here in Wisconsin people know me very, very well.<br></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a local guy. People know who I am, they know what I believe in and they know I mean what I say and I say what I mean and I don\u2019t do it in a mean way, and I think that\u2019s the kind of politics, that the kind of policies that Wisconsite Republicans reward. That\u2019s why I think I won; I wouldn\u2019t ascribe anything other to it than that.\u201d</p> <p>Other prominent Wisconsinites include Priebus, the Republican National Committee chair, and Governor Scott Walker. All three are likely to play a leading role in rebuilding the party if Trump suffers an electoral meltdown.</p> <p>Stephan Thompson, a Republican strategist and ally of Walker, said on Monday that Nehlen was a \u201cphony\u201d and a \u201cbig joke\u201d who wanted his \u201c15 minutes of fame\u201d. He described Ryan\u2019s balancing act \u2013 defending his seat, protecting the congressional majority and dealing with Trump \u2013 as \u201carguably the hardest job in politics right now\u201d.</p> <p>The speaker is officially backing Trump, although privately he is said to be tormented by the nominee\u2019s wayward antics. Yet another example reared its head on Tuesday. Ryan said he had a busy day and did not hear Trump\u2019s comment about the second amendment, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\">interpreted by some as an assassination threat</a> against Hillary Clinton. \u201cIt sounds like just a joke gone bad,\u201d he added. \u201cI hope he clears it up very quickly. You should never joke about something like that.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan refused to answer a question about whether he would consider running for president in future.</p> <p>As the primary result became clear, Nehlen, who was endorsed by a Super Pac affiliated with conservative activists known as the Tea Party Patriots, insisted he had a won a victory of sorts. \u201cWe very likely stopped TPP [the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal] and damaged Paul Ryan\u2019s ability to continue growing government,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThat\u2019s the beginning of a fight we\u2019re ready to get started.\u201d</p> <p>Coulter posted a sarcastic tweet about the coverage of Ryan\u2019s win, comparing it with his Democratic counterpart Nancy Pelosi. \u201cCan you imagine a breaking news story: \u201cNANCY PELOSI WINS HER PRIMARY!\u201d she wrote.</p>",

Data is only collected when the app is in use.</p> <p>\u201cOur EULA and privacy policy does disclose that we may collect data, but we are currently in the process of reviewing our privacy &amp; data collection protocols in an effort to provide more transparency for our customers.\u201d</p> <p>For their part, follower and goldfisk decided to seize the initiative, launching the \u201cPrivate Play Accord\u201d, an initiative to encourage sex toy manufacturers to sign up to basic standards of privacy and security. \u201cWe want to promote transparency so that people can make informed buying decisions,\u201d follower said. They have come up with a draft rating system for products, so that users can be sure that their latest sex toy isn\u2019t reporting the intensity of their use back to HQ.</p>",

They understand that the Second Amendment is on the ballot.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s campaign went on the record in May saying that she believes the Supreme Court\u2019s 2008 Heller decision, a key victory for gun rights, was \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-20/hillary-clinton-believes-pivotal-gun-rights-ruling-was-wrong-adviser-says\">wrongly decided</a>.\u201d </p> <p>The 5-4 Heller decision struck down the District of Columbia\u2019s handgun ban as unconstitutional, ruling that Americans have an individual right to own guns for self-defense in their homes. </p> <p>\u201cIf Heller is overturned, that paves the way for extreme gun control for decades,\u201d Baker said. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NRA/status/763158125721497600\">official NRA Twitter feed</a> compared Trump\u2019s remarks to a 2008 comment from then-Senator Joseph Biden, who said \u201cIf [Obama] tries to fool with my Beretta, he\u2019s got a problem,\u201d and asked \u201cWas Joe Biden\u2026suggesting violence here?\u201d</p> <p>Katie Pavlich, a prominent conservative writer who spoke at this year\u2019s NRA annual meeting, also slammed the media\u2019s coverage of Trump\u2019s remarks, tweeting: \u201cMedia totally exposed itself (again) today by assuming Second Amendment supporters are assassins instead of voters.\u201d </p> <p>But <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KatiePavlich/status/763134167794135040\">she added</a>: \u201cThat said Trump is reason Trump has no credibility/isn\u2019t given the benefit of the doubt when actually misunderstood.\u201d She was referencing Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/24/donald-trump-says-he-could-shoot-somebody-and-still-not-lose-voters\">remark in January</a> that \u201cI could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn\u2019t lose voters.\u201d </p> <p>Pavlich wrote: \u201cI\u2019m not defending Trump or his comments, I\u2019m defending Second Amendment supporters.\u201d </p> <p>The supreme court has become a central election issue since the death earlier this year of Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative who has not yet been replaced.

Michael Keegan, president of <a href=\"http://www.pfaw.org/\">People for the American Way</a>, said: \u201cThere has been no shortage of inexcusable rhetoric from Trump, but suggesting gun violence is truly abhorrent. There is no place in our public discourse for this kind of statement, especially from someone seeking the nation\u2019s highest office.\u201d</p> <p>Neil Sroka, communications director of <a href=\"https://www.democracyforamerica.com/\">Democracy for America</a>, added: \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s a little unclear whether Donald Trump was calling for his supporters to assassinate a Clinton court pick or take up an armed insurrection against a government that allowed her to appoint one. Either way, the only thing more insane than electing someone president who blows this kind of violent dog whistle would be buying the furious spin coming out of his campaign trying to explain it away.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has produced a shortlist of conservative justices that he hopes will appeal to the Republican base and deter those considering defecting to Clinton, who could set the court on a liberal trajectory for years to come.</p> <p>He told supporters on Tuesday: \u201cI guess there\u2019s a scenario in which this president could pick five supreme court justices, and if you pick two that are left, left, left, it\u2019s going to be a disaster for our country.\u201d<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/20/nra-endorses-donald-trump-convention\">NRA had endorsed him early</a>, he added. \u201cWe want to replace with justices very much like Justice Scalia and that\u2019s going to happen, that\u2019s so important. One of the most important elections for a lot of reasons, not just that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He also told the rally that Clinton is \u201cdangerous\u201d and could destroy the country from within because of her immigration policies.</p> <p>Trump was introduced by Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor, who brought up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/07/iran-executes-nuclear-scientist-shahram-amiri-returned-country-from-us\">the case of Shahram Amiri</a>, an Iranian nuclear scientist executed for spying for the US. Clinton received emails mentioning him on her controversial personal server when she was secretary of state.</p> <p>Giuliani said: \u201cRemember Hillary told us there was no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/hillary-clinton-emails-fbi-investigation-next-steps\">top secret information on her emails</a>? Remember she told us that. Well, she lied! And I don\u2019t know the connection between that and the death of Mr Amiri, but what I do know is it put a lot more attention on him when they found those emails. It certainly put him at great risk, even if they didn\u2019t find them, and it shows you that when the director of the FBI said she was extremely careless, he was being kind.\u201d</p> <p>But Giuliani repeatedly waved away chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d from the crowd.</p> <p><em>Lois Beckett contributed reporting.</em></p>",

Political news has become addictive to a degree unheard of since those fevered weeks in November 1990 when Margaret Thatcher\u2019s long regime <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/thatcher-resigns-from-archive\">was brought to an end</a> in an internal Tory putsch. The coup\u2019s primary provocation was Thatcher\u2019s surly attitude to Europe \u2013 and to her deputy prime minister, the Europhile <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/10/geoffrey-howe-most-celebrated-quotes\">Geoffrey Howe</a>. Back then Howe was closely aligned with Thatcher\u2019s former chancellor Nigel Lawson, who has since reinvented himself as<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/02/nigel-lawson-on-brexit-i-love-europe-but-eu-has-no-purpose\"> a bullish Brexiter</a>. Labour\u2019s current travails also remind us of its own internal differences over Europe. In 1981 Labour\u2019s hostility to Europe precipitated the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/mar/14/liberal-party-history\">breakaway of the \u201cgang of four\u201d</a> \u2013 Roy Jenkins, Shirley Williams, David Owen and Bill Rodgers \u2013 to form the Social Democratic party. Curiously, like Lawson, Owen too is now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/24/eu-beyond-reform-says-former-foreign-secretary-lord-owen\">a convert to Brexit</a>, as is <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/news/jim-sillars-snp-members-should-back-brexit-1-4091234\">Jim Sillars</a>, the architect of the SNP\u2019s successful \u201cindependence in Europe\u201d policy. Europe has split parties, ruined political careers and prompted strange Damascene conversions; what it has not done until now is fan the interest of the British public.</p> <p>Turnout in the UK for elections to the European parliament has rarely risen above 35%. Why has something so seemingly peripheral to mainstream British politics brought about so much disruption? Benjamin Grob-Fitzgibbon, a diplomat in the US State Department and former academic, brings an outsider\u2019s perspective to our squabbles. He emphasises the ways in which the empire and Commonwealth influenced Britain\u2019s relationship with the European project. But his findings will dismay cod-Churchillian Brexiters.</p> <p>This is because Winston Churchill emerges from these pages as the champion of a \u201cUnited States of Europe\u201d, a formulation that he first used in 1938 and returned to in opposition, after the war. Churchill\u2019s confident leadership of the United Europe movement \u2013 confidence derived from Britain\u2019s imperial standing \u2013 paved the way for the establishment of the Council of Europe in 1949, with British participation. Grob-Fitzgibbon is persuasively insistent that imperial commitments did not run counter to European ideals, but, surprising as it may seem, underpinned them. In the late 40s Churchill understood that Britain was pulled in different directions, by its empire, by the Atlantic alliance, and by the imperative to rebuild European civilisation on durable foundations. Yet these various demanding commitments were complementary. For \u201cimperial Europeans\u201d in the Conservative party, such as Churchill, Julian Amery, Duncan Sandys and Harold Macmillan, it was obvious that European renewal called for globally engaged leadership. Colonial possessions did not in themselves provide a structural impediment to European integration, quite the reverse. After all, France had its own overseas empire, and it was to these two global powers that the leadership of Europe must inevitably fall. In the immediate postwar era Labour\u2019s foreign secretary, the pragmatic trade unionist Ernest Bevin, shared some of these broad assumptions, though with some scepticism about Churchill\u2019s plans for a European Assembly. Bevin\u2019s own vision of a \u201cWestern Union\u201d \u2013 a sphere of industrial and military cooperation in western Europe \u2013 was also an imperial one, drawing on the resources of Britain\u2019s colonies and dominions.</p> <p>However, according to Grob-Fitzgibbon, British leadership of the European project evaporated in the spring of 1950. The fraught circumstances of the Berlin airlift in 1948-9 had convinced Bevin that western European cooperation was insufficient in itself, and required the external support of the US. Discerning British hesitancy, Jean Monnet, one of the architects of European integration, abandoned his existing vision of Anglo-French leadership and plumped instead for a Franco-German project. The result, rapidly formulated, was the Schuman plan for a joint authority superintending Franco-German coal and steel production. Although Churchill and the Daily Mail \u2013 then fervently Europhile \u2013 were enthusiastic about the Schuman plan, Bevin was lukewarm.</p> <p>All was not lost. Churchill\u2019s government of 1951-5 promised to be the most Europhile in British history, except for the foreign secretary, Anthony Eden, who, while happy to use pro-European rhetoric from time to time, was much less enthusiastic about the prospects for a European army. Nevertheless, the vision of Anglo-French partnership remained alive, for a while. Eden himself, as Churchill\u2019s successor, orchestrated the calamitous collusion between the two powers at Suez in 1956. Under intense economic pressure from the US, Eden unilaterally decided upon a ceasefire, without consulting his French allies.</p> <p>The six members (France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg) of the European Coal and Steel Community had already met at Messina in 1955 to plan a common market, which was launched in 1957 under the Treaty of Rome as the European Economic Community (EEC). But as far as Britain\u2019s swaggering \u201cimperial Europeans\u201d were concerned this was still \u201cLittle Europe\u201d. There was room for something bolder and more comprehensive. In 1959 Britain, along with Sweden, played a leading role in establishing the European Free Trade Association, which also included Norway, Denmark, Portugal, Switzerland and Austria. Nevertheless, the UK did not envisage the Efta seven as a long-term rival to the EEC six so much as a stepping stone for membership of the common market.</p> <p>However, the aftershocks of Suez lingered. French president Charles de Gaulle never forgot that Britain\u2019s primary relationship was with the US, and twice during the 1960s blocked British applications to join the EEC \u2013 first from Harold Macmillan\u2019s Tory government, and then from Labour\u2019s Harold Wilson. Yet De Gaulle \u2013 ironically \u2013 was no fan of EEC-style integration, preferring instead a looser, anti-federalist \u201c<em>Europe des patries</em>\u201d. As Macmillan confided to his diary, \u201cDe Gaulle wants the kind of Europe that we would be able readily to join, but he doesn\u2019t want us in it.\u201d</p> <p>Macmillan\u2019s application to join the EEC clarified Labour opposition to it. Hugh Gaitskell, James Callaghan and Douglas Jay favoured an outward-looking internationalism based on a global, multi-racial Commonwealth. The EEC they regarded as a sinister capitalist plot to stymie socialism. By the mid-60s, a stark division appeared to prevail between a pro-Commonwealth Labour government faced by a Conservative opposition, led by Ted Heath, which was committed to EEC entry. But the appeal of the Commonwealth \u2013 an increasingly fanciful panacea for Britain\u2019s economic woes \u2013 waned, and in 1967 Wilson\u2019s Labour government submitted its own application to join the EEC, which was promptly vetoed by France.</p> <p>With the demise of De Gaulle, Britain under Heath was at last admitted in 1973. However, the legislation paving the way for entry was only achieved with the help of 69 pro-European Labour MPs who defied their own party whip to support the government. For, with the passing of empire and the outward-looking confidence it engendered, the Tory backbenches had seen the first stirrings of Eurosceptic rebellion. In 1975 Wilson \u2013 crafty, cynical and competent \u2013 suppressed some of Labour\u2019s divisions with a referendum on Europe in which collective cabinet responsibility was temporarily suspended to allow ministers to campaign on either side. With the steady support of prominent Euro-agnostics \u2013 most notably Callaghan, by then Labour\u2019s foreign secretary, and Thatcher, the new leader of the Tory party \u2013 Wilson achieved his intended result: a 67% vote to stay in, which decisively confirmed British membership of the EEC.</p> <p>A few minor errors notwithstanding, Grob-Fitzgibbon has produced an absorbing account of our current predicament. He interprets the Euroscepticism of the last few decades as a post-imperial condition, in which the longing for a lost greatness is so desperate that it grossly distorts the objects of nostalgia. But all of us, remainers as well as Eurosceptics, have lazily bought into the dominant narrative. A zesty and ingenious Remain campaign \u2013 of the sort we conspicuously lacked \u2013 might have presented the Europhile Churchill as a patriotic anti-Brexit icon.

Why has the government allowed these incidents to continue?</p> <p><strong>Turnbull</strong>: As you know, and Scott as a former immigration minister may want to add to this, but we continue to support the Nauru government to provide for the health, welfare and safety of all transferees and refugees on Nauru. The material that\u2019s been published will be examined. It\u2019s not clear over what time period it relates, at least not in the report that I saw. <strong>It will be carefully examined to see if there are any complaints there or issues there that were not properly addressed.</strong></p> <p><strong>Morrison</strong>: I note the incidents reports, as you know Paul, are reports of allegations, <strong>they are not findings of fact in relation to an incident</strong>. And the reporting system that was put in place was to monitor what those allegations are and provide an opportunity to follow up and discussion both at the centre level and between governments, and that\u2019s their purpose. It\u2019s important to stress that incidents reports of themselves aren\u2019t a reporting of fact. They are a reporting that an allegation has been made.</p> <p><strong>Farrell</strong>: You commissioned a royal commission into the Don Dale events within 12 hours. What will it take you to be shocked about what is happening on the detention centres on Nauru when you have primary evidence from guards and case workers saying children are being abused?</p> <p><strong>Turnbull</strong>: As I said, just to reiterate what Scott said as well, the matters that are referred to here in these incidents reports will be reviewed to see whether they \u2013 whether and to what extent they have been dealt with. This is a \u2013 the Australian government provides support to the government of Nauru and their police force in dealing with complaints of this kind and they have the responsibility for responding to them and dealing with them.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-10T05:01:36.316Z\">at 6.01am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57aa83a9e4b03b51a99e19f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-10T02:24:32.618Z\">3.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There are obvious parallels being drawn between the Four Corners report last month on alleged mistreatment and abuse of detainees inside the Don Dale juvenile detention centre in the Northern Territory, and the Nauru files.</p> <p>Both shine light and reveal the shocking extent of issues inside the respective centres.

Clearly if a Senate inquiry is not able to pick up this level of abuse \u2026 then we have a serious question here in Australia about the extent of the cover-up in relation to Manus Island and Nauru, and only a royal commission has the power to do that.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Jana Favero,</strong> from the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said the reports \u201cconfirmed a lot of unofficial reports\u201d she had seen in past three years. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s echoing the 4am phone calls that we have been receiving from Nauru and Manus from desperate, broken people,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople that our government has broken.\u201d </p> <p><strong>Mat Tinkler,</strong> from Save the Children, said his organisation was surprised by the publication of the Nauru files today but not by the content of the files, which he said echoed concerns it had raised with government on a number of occasions.</p> <p>\u201cThe last thing that Save the Children was advised [by the federal government] was that their concerns were noted and that they would be taken into consideration,\u201d Tinkler said.</p> <p>The government had adequate information to act on human rights abuses on Nauru but lacked the political will, he said.</p> <p><strong>Misha Coleman,</strong> from Australian churches refugee taskforce, called on the government to exercise the same political will it used to institute a royal commission into youth detention in the Northern Territory and investigate its own practices on Nauru.</p> <p>She also called for a royal commission.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/callapilla/status/763184127923281920\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Heads of refugee advocacy agencies call for all refugees in Manus and Nauru to be brought to Australia <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/naurufiles?src=hash\">#naurufiles</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/4chw5iCZh7\">pic.twitter.com/4chw5iCZh7</a></p>&mdash; Calla Wahlquist (@callapilla) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/callapilla/status/763184127923281920\">August 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-10T03:27:05.150Z\">at 4.27am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57aa89bce4b033cb0795e9eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-10T01:56:39.071Z\">2.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, was asked about the Nauru files a short time ago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lenoretaylor/status/763191526163750912\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">PM <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TurnbullMalcolm\">@TurnbullMalcolm</a> says the government will carefully examine <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/naurufiles?src=hash\">#naurufiles</a></p>&mdash; Lenore Taylor (@lenoretaylor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lenoretaylor/status/763191526163750912\">August 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-10T01:58:05.851Z\">at 2.58am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57aa8327e4b0f5d064842014\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-10T01:52:27.445Z\">2.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Gillian Triggs,</strong> the Australian human rights commissioner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/10/gillian-triggs-says-onus-on-australian-public-to-change-detention-policy-after-nauru-files-leak\">has responded to the report</a>, urging the Australian public to \u201cspeak out and talk up\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe really need the public\u2019s attention to ensure that our politicians change the policy.

Indeed, that had long been the case - on pretty much every surface. The most dominant world No 1 in the history of the ATP rankings went on to win the French too - finally - and seemed in good shape for Wimbledon.

He was able to return to training following an operation, but the doubts meant his mother had not bought tickets to Rio. \u201cDaniel had a very serious injury,\u201d she revealed. \u201cWe weren\u2019t quite sure if he was going to make it to Rio.\u201d </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-09T10:05:00.254Z\">at 11.05am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57a9a90be4b0f5d064841bd2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-09T09:58:37.155Z\">10.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Time for a recap of today\u2019s gold medals on offer, courtesy of my colleague Claire Phipps\u2019 exhaustive briefing earlier</strong>.</p> <h2>Diary</h2> <p>Find the full schedule in your timezone <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2016/aug/05/rio-olympics-2016-full-events-schedule\">on this link</a>.

All I had to do was send it to eBay\u2019s collection centre for international deliveries in Derbyshire.

However, this was all in German, therefore I could not understand a word.

And how utterly lovely it\u2019s been. In this final episode, the emotional menagerie includes rhinos, lions, some wild deer and a pangolin. What\u2019s a pangolin, you say? Well, we\u2019re glad you asked, seeing as it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s most endangered species. Let\u2019s go all in for the pangolin. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2><strong>Versailles </strong><br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>It\u2019s au revoir for now to the big-budget drama, and what started out as a saucy little romp is going out with a bang in this brutal finale. There have been after-dinner orgies, controversial dwarves and a bit of trouble with the builders, but now the action steps up a gear. Never one to play it safe, that young saucepot Sophie (Maddison Jaizani) risks the wrath of beady-eyed henchman Marchal (Tygh Runyan).

The only problem? All her work colleagues think she\u2019s 26.

Cimino initially dwells poignantly on a communal wedding celebration before plunging his characters into the hell of battle and its harrowing aftermath \u2013 Russian roulette gambling in backstreet Saigon.

  "<p>More than half of women have suffered sexual harassment in the workplace, including sexual assaults and comments about their bodies, research has found.<br></p> <p>Researchers from the Trades Union Congress and the Everyday Sexism Project found that 52% of women had experienced unwanted behaviour at work including groping, sexual advances and inappropriate jokes. Among women and girls aged 16-24, the proportion reporting sexual harassment rose to 63%.</p> <p>Around one in eight women reported unwanted sexual touching of their breasts, buttocks or genitals or attempts to kiss them at work, which the report\u2019s authors point out would be considered sexual assault under the law.

Nearly one in five women have experienced unwanted sexual advances \u2013 with one in&#xa0;eight being touched intimately or kissed against their will.</p> <p>And far from being a problem that is diminishing, something that used to happen in the shops and offices of the 1980s and 90s, younger women are now more likely to be subjected to sexual harassment. Often this is because younger women are more likely to be in low-paid, insecure work. Previous TUC research has shown that women without job security feel less able to take action against a colleague or employer because they fear retaliation such as having their hours drastically cut.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sexual harassment can be undermining.

In a frightening 17% of cases, the harasser was someone with line management responsibility for the victim.

General anti-bullying codes that don\u2019t mention sexual harassment are not enough. Employers need to have strong and specific policies \u2013 and to train all their managers how to spot it and stamp it out. Plus, they must set up ways to report sexual harassment that prevent repercussions on the victim.</p> <p>The government has to step up, too.

  "<p>In 2013, at a conference on endangered languages, a retired teacher named Linda Lambrecht announced the extraordinary discovery of a previously unknown language. Lambrecht \u2013 who is Chinese-Hawaiian, 71 years old, warm but no-nonsense \u2013 called it <a href=\"http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/21440949/nearly-lost-language-discovered-in-hawaii\">Hawaii Sign Language</a>, or HSL. In front of a room full of linguists, she demonstrated that its core vocabulary \u2013 words such as \u201cmother\u201d, \u201cpig\u201d and \u201csmall\u201d \u2013 was distinct from that of other sign languages.</p> <p>The linguists were immediately convinced. William O\u2019Grady, the chair of the linguistics department at the University of Hawaii, called it \u201cthe first time in 80 years that a new language has been discovered in the United States \u2014 and maybe the last time.\u201d But the new language found 80 years ago was in remote Alaska, whereas HSL was hiding in plain sight in Honolulu, a metropolitan area of nearly a million people. It was the kind of discovery that made the world seem larger.</p> <p>The last-minute arrival of recognition and support for HSL was a powerful, almost surreal vindication for Lambrecht, whose first language is HSL. For decades, it was stigmatised or ignored; now the language has acquired an agreed-upon name, an official \u201clanguage code\u201d from the <a href=\"http://www.iso.org/iso/home.html\">International Organization for Standardization</a>, the attention of linguists around the world, and a three-year grant from the<a href=\"http://www.eldp.net/\"> Endangered Languages Documentation Programme</a> at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/oct/03/the-race-to-save-a-dying-language-podcast\">The race to save a dying language \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But just as linguists were substantiating its existence, HSL stood on the brink of extinction, remembered by just a handful of signers. Unless the language made a miraculous recovery, Lambrecht feared that her announcement might turn out to be HSL\u2019s obituary.</p> <p>Three years after announcing its existence, Lambrecht is still unearthing her language sign by sign. She may be the only person in the world who still uses HSL on a regular basis, signing into a camera while a linguist named James \u201cWoody\u201d Woodward and a handful of graduate students from the University of Hawaii document her every move.</p> <p>Led by Lambrecht, Woodward, and researcher Barbara Earth, the project aims to document what may be the last-ever conversations of native HSL signers. The goal is to record at least 20 hours of high-quality video footage of natural HSL and then transcribe, translate, and archive it. The researchers hope that this work \u2013 along with a series of illustrated handbooks depicting over 1,000 signs, and a regular class at the University of Hawaii set to begin next year \u2013 will jump-start the revitalisation of HSL.</p> <p>The project faces numerous obstacles. The first is the scepticism of many of the remaining signers themselves. Hawaii\u2019s tiny Deaf community is deeply divided. Some say HSL is not a real language, others see it as backward; still others are sceptical of Lambrecht.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"33d46d9ee1e159fa4329fb85cc2772fa7ade4178\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33d46d9ee1e159fa4329fb85cc2772fa7ade4178/0_0_556_1155/481.jpg\" alt=\"Dying Language\" width=\"481\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by Christian Montenegro</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: dutchuncle.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the gravest threat to HSL is <a href=\"https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/american-sign-language\">American Sign Language</a> (ASL), which is advancing across the globe \u2013 from Hawaii to Thailand to Togo \u2013 just as fast as English. The Deaf world, intensely local until recently, is consolidating and globalising in unprecedented ways. And the forward march of ASL, which in certain ways brings people together, also poses a significant danger to many of the estimated 400 sign languages used all over the world \u2013 most of which we know nothing about.</p> <p>Hawaii is a bellwether, but Deaf culture all around the world \u2013 for many on the inside it is a \u201ccapital-D\u201d culture, not a \u201clower-case-d\u201d disability \u2013 faces threats from every direction. The \u201cmainstreaming\u201d of deaf students means that they are placed in hearing schools, where they are encouraged to be just like everyone else but with \u201cspecial needs\u201d, in a process that some call deliberate assimilation. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/mar/16/bionic-ears-cochlear-implants-transformed-lives-children\">Cochlear implants</a> (and the potential of gene therapy) even more fundamentally endanger sign languages \u2013 some Deaf activists condemn such \u201ccures\u201d as <a href=\"https://thesocietypages.org/sociologylens/2011/02/24/cochlear-implants-miracle-technology-or-cultural-genocide/\">being akin to genocide</a>.</p> <p>If the loss of a particular language such as HSL means the end of a whole expressive system, the disappearance of sign language in general \u2013 the only fully fledged form of language completely independent of speech \u2013 would permanently impoverish human communication.</p> <p>Like every natural language, HSL is the evolved product of a specific history, the unconscious creation of a community. For it to survive, local signers will have to make a deliberate choice to use it. The same may be increasingly true of Deafness itself. The story of HSL raises crucial questions in an age of globalisation: Do cultures on the margins have a future? Will enough people choose to be that different, and will they do it together?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Though they parallel spoken languages in certain ways, sign languages represent a fundamentally different way of communicating. They neither derive from, nor correspond to, spoken languages. Nor are all sign languages mutually intelligible, as hearing people often assume \u2013 they are as various as spoken languages.</p> <p>Their historical evolution is distinctive. Infants can sign before they can speak, and the great sign language linguist <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/11/us/william-stokoe-jr-sign-language-advocate-dies-at-80.html\">William Stokoe</a> argued that sign may have preceded speech in the history of human language. It\u2019s considered normal for one in 1,000 children to be born profoundly deaf, but places with higher rates of inherited deafness \u2013 such as the village of <a href=\"http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/deaf-arab-villagers-create-new-language/\">al-Sayyid in Israel</a> and <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/theres-a-village-in-bali-where-everyone-knows-sign-language-511\">Bengkala in Bali</a> \u2013 have been natural hotspots for sign languages.</p> <p>For sign languages, and for Deaf culture more broadly, intergenerational transmission is far from straightforward. The vast majority of deaf adults give birth to hearing children, while most deaf children are born to hearing adults who have no connection with the Deaf communities.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Signing is not miming, and signs are not just gestures that anyone can immediately grasp</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Signing is not miming, and signs are not \u201cjust\u201d gestures that anyone can immediately grasp. \u201cIconic\u201d signs, where the gesture self-evidently expresses meaning, play a role in every sign language, but even they can be wonderfully nuanced. In HSL, for instance, \u201ccry\u201d is signed with spread-finger \u201ctears\u201d running out from the sides of the eyes, while \u201cbawl\u201d has the fingers running straight down. Still, abstraction and convention are essential, just as in speech, because not everything can be expressed with self-evident gestures. There is nothing obvious, for example, about the HSL sign for \u201cman\u201d or \u201cboy\u201d: a spread hand moving down across the head.</p> <p>For most of recorded history, sign languages have been effectively invisible to hearing people. It was not until William Stokoe\u2019s groundbreaking study of ASL, published in 1960, that any sign language had been analysed as a fully fledged communication system with a grammar of its own. In 1965 Stokoe published an ASL dictionary, also the first of its kind.</p> <p>Now that the kind of geographical isolation that once bred new languages is no more, sign languages represent something of a final frontier. \u201cWe really don\u2019t know how many sign languages there are,\u201d says Albert Bickford of the global sign languages team at the language database <a href=\"https://www.ethnologue.com/\">Ethnologue</a>. \u201cIt seems reasonable to assume that the majority of sign languages currently in use in the world have not been discovered yet,\u201d Victoria Nyst, a linguist at Leiden University, told me.</p> <p>The most recent edition of Ethnologue, published earlier this year, mentions 141 sign languages. Over a hundred more have been reported, Bickford says, but no solid information on them exists \u2013 just the barest indication that Deaf people may sign differently in a particular place. We may never know much about these languages, or even confirm their existence.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Lambrecht\u2019s announcement in 2013<strong> </strong>was the culmination of a lifetime of work. Born deaf, she hears almost nothing, barely even the noise of a siren blaring in her street. \u201cI grew up very frustrated, thinking I\u2019m not deaf, I\u2019m not deaf, I\u2019m hearing! I want to be an actress, I want to be a dancer, I want to be a movie star!\u201d Lambrecht told me late last year at the University of Hawaii. \u201cI was so frustrated that I couldn\u2019t be those things.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.linfo.org/teletype.html\">Teletype</a>, an early form of texting, and <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/closed-captioning-television\">closed captioning</a>, which made TV and films accessible, were life-changing developments for her when they became widespread in the 1970s. \u201cAfter that, I settled down,\u201d she said. \u201cI hated being deaf until that communication barrier broke down, when all those devices came out.\u201d</p> <p>The youngest of seven children, Lambrecht started signing HSL at home in the late 1940s \u2013 learning it from two of her older brothers, who were both deaf like her. She was probably one of the last people anywhere to learn HSL naturally, as a first language, and picking it up from family was particularly unusual. By then, the dorm at Hawaii\u2019s only deaf school was the closest thing HSL had to a homeland \u2013 it was there that one of her brothers learned it.</p> <p>But ASL was already coming in. Soon after the second world war, an unprecedented number of Deaf mainlanders came to Hawaii to work or retire. Within a few decades, ASL was dominant, HSL almost dormant. \u201cWe would get a lot of insults, a lot of negativity,\u201d Lambrecht recalled. \u201cDeaf people here would put themselves into an inferior category compared to the people who brought ASL. People said, \u2018They\u2019re from America, they\u2019re white people, they know better.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Lambrecht made a living by teaching ASL for 33 years, mostly to hearing people, but in her spare time she pursued HSL, tracking down old signers in hospitals and nursing homes. \u201cWe used to go to the other islands to drum up people, and now they\u2019re all dead, dead, dead,\u201d her husband, Jeff, said. Interested mainlanders had documented a small number of local signs, and they encouraged Lambrecht to do more. Years in, she realised she had been collecting the remains of a complete and original language.</p> <p>Without funding and without linguistic expertise, Lambrecht\u2019s efforts stalled until 2007, when a woman named Barbara Earth came to Hawaii and enrolled in her ASL class. After a career working on gender and development in Asia and Africa, Earth was going deaf and wanted to learn how to sign.</p> <p>Embracing Lambrecht\u2019s cause and digging into HSL history, Earth hunted for money to support the project. Three years later, she found enough for a pilot study, interviewing 19 elderly Deaf people and two children of Deaf adults on four Hawaiian islands. William O\u2019Grady, the linguistics department chair at the University of Hawaii, agreed to host the project at the university: \u201cBarbara knocked on my door and said there was an unknown sign language here in Hawaii, and she needed help to prove that it existed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"41038fc68fde4481e56dc6fdabd240c3a3fa9acf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41038fc68fde4481e56dc6fdabd240c3a3fa9acf/0_60_5870_3523/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Linda Lambrecht, left, teaches Hawaii Sign Language.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Linda Lambrecht, left, teaches Hawaii Sign Language.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eugene Tanner Photography, LLC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An initial estimate of up to 280 surviving HSL signers was soon revised down to 40, then down to just 10 or so old-timers still likely to be competent in HSL. ASL had made deep inroads even among these signers, but there was evidence, especially from Lambrecht\u2019s signs, that HSL was distinct, and lay close enough to the surface to be recovered. Spoken languages such as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/european_languages/languages/basque.shtml\">Basque</a>, Welsh, and Hawaiian have come back from the brink of extinction \u2013 could HSL be the first sign language to do it?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>For James Woodward, the mass extinction<strong> </strong>of sign languages is bound up in prejudice and chauvinism. He believes that every local sign language should have the chance to become a valued, modernised language of education, giving communities a choice and a chance at continuity.

Their funny and furious signing was almost all in ASL, as usual, but here and there old bits of HSL were surfacing.</p> <p>\u201cIs this Deaf culture or what!?\u201d Hilda Lopez signed. \u201cI love it, I love it, I love it.\u201d She kissed her own hands as she signed. \u201cHSL is really number one in my life. The ones who don\u2019t like it are small-minded!\u201d</p> <p>Lopez explained to me that her first name in English is Hilda, but her name sign \u2013 her real, everyday name in the Deaf community \u2013 is a pointing gesture towards the mouth, based on an incident at her fifth birthday party when someone fired a BB gun and shot out some of her teeth. It\u2019s a classic HSL name sign: blunt, comic and personal, based on physical characteristics and memorable incidents.</p> <p>Like any language, HSL can be broken down by linguists, but its personality, its characteristic style of discourse, is harder to get a handle on. Even when signing ASL, Lopez seems to embody the HSL style. \u201cWhen they\u2019re using ASL, people talk too long and make other people bored,\u201d she told me. \u201cHSL is short and thrilling and fast.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>HSL has a bigger 'signing space' than ASL \u2013 anywhere from the top of the head to the bottom of the torso</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>HSL has a bigger \u201csigning space\u201d than ASL \u2013 meaningful signs can be made anywhere from the top of the head to the bottom of the torso. Signs that occur not on the hands but elsewhere on the body also play an important role. \u201cKick\u201d is signed only with the leg, for instance, while a raised eyebrow is a vital bit of grammar, signalling a yes or no question, or a conditional clause beginning with \u201cif\u201d. The \u201cvocalisations\u201d accompanying certain signs, which fellow signers can sometimes lip-read, echo different spoken languages: borrowed words from <a href=\"http://www.polynesia.com/polynesian_culture/hawaii/languages.html#.V6m7VzYrKuo\">Hawaiian</a>, English and <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2015/11/12/living/pidgin-english-hawaii/\">Hawaii Pidgin</a>.</p> <p>Lopez thinks and talks to herself in sign. \u201cI\u2019m 100% Deaf!\u201d she said proudly. \u201cI don\u2019t hear sound, but I can feel it, I feel the body vibrations in my chest: bass drums, police sirens. The only thing I can hear is fireworks \u2014 I don\u2019t like the smell of them, they make me sick, but I like the noise and vibration.\u201d</p> <p>Lopez never knew her biological parents, but she is fiercely proud of her <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/06/native-hawaiian-population/\">Native Hawaiian</a> and mixed-ethnic roots. At least one piece of evidence, an 1821 letter discovered by Barbara Earth, seems to link HSL to the Native Hawaiian past. In that year, an American missionary, newly arrived in the <a href=\"http://www.hawaiiankingdom.org/political-history.shtml\">Kingdom of Hawaii</a>, met a deaf man and bargained with him over 40 sticks of firewood and a pig. Some of the man\u2019s signs were \u201cin common use\u201d, seemingly among both deaf and hearing people, wrote the missionary. The signs he recorded for \u201cpig\u201d, \u201cmoney\u201d, \u201csee\u201d, and a system of counting by clapping, are still present in HSL today.</p> <p>The rate of inherited deafness in Hawaii is normal. But by the late 19th century, waves of Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese and Filipino immigrants were coming to Hawaii to work on the American-run plantations, and a new multi-racial Deaf community took shape in Honolulu, including boot shiners, launderers, and flower sellers. There was even what a contemporary newspaper called a \u201cfancy deaf wedding\u201d, where 80 of the guests used \u201cthe sign language\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe turning point, the beginning of the end of HSL,\u201d according to Barbara Earth, was the founding of Hawaii\u2019s deaf school in 1914. Like most schools at the time, it promoted <a href=\"http://www.deafwebsites.com/education/oralism.html\">oralism</a>, the system of lip-reading and speaking that is almost universally despised in Deaf communities for being painful, unnatural and ineffective. But for a while the school was also a unique environment for the clandestine transmission of HSL. One former student, Norman Galapin, told me that he learned HSL \u201con the playgrounds and in the dorm\u201d, though \u201cif the teacher saw you signing, sometimes they would slap your hands, or hit you with a ruler, or pinch your cheek.\u201d</p> <p>During the 1940s, HSL was already a language in transition, according to Galapin: \u201cThey weren\u2019t using the old [HSL] sign for \u2018mother\u2019, they were using this [ASL] one, but they were still using the old sign for \u2018father\u2019.\u201d Starting in 1939, a few charismatic teachers from the mainland played a vital role in overturning oralism and legitimising sign language, but they ended up promoting ASL over HSL in the process.</p> <p>Employment, education and access to government services \u2013 from court interpreters to mental health provision in sign language \u2013 were perennial problems in the community, but many deaf Hawaiians thrived as master carpenters, printers, mechanics, postal workers and even ukulele makers. As elsewhere, an informal Deaf Club was at the centre of an unusually tightknit community, organising Christmas parties, bowling nights and an annual summer camp-out on the beach, with up to 100 people fishing and cooking for two weeks straight.</p> <p>Yet Hilda Lopez, like many Deaf Hawaiians, left Hawaii for the mainland for education and for work, arriving in California in her teens. The culture shock was intense: \u201cIt was all ASL, and I wasn\u2019t really comfortable with it,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople seemed to know so much, I felt that I wasn\u2019t very smart\u2026. I got confused and I lost HSL, I didn\u2019t really remember it any more.\u201d Only now, haltingly peeling away the layers of ASL, is she starting to reclaim the language.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>No other sign language comes close to having the influence of ASL. Accurate, up-to-date signer numbers do not exist for any sign language, but most of the larger ones are not even yet secure in their own countries. There are more than 20 million deaf people in China, for instance, but <a href=\"https://www.start-american-sign-language.com/chinese-sign-language_html\">Chinese Sign Language</a>, which has hardly been documented, has only been acknowledged as a distinct language for the last 30 years.</p> <p>By comparison, ASL is a powerhouse, supported and promoted by institutions such as the <a href=\"https://nad.org/\">National Association of the Deaf</a>, and <a href=\"http://www2.gallaudet.edu/attend-gallaudet/about-gallaudet/\">Gallaudet University</a> in Washington DC, which describes itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s only university with programmes and services specifically designed to accommodate deaf and hard of hearing students\u201d. Gallaudet plays a critical role in the American Deaf community and in the life of ASL. Until recently, the university supported both a college prep centre in Honolulu (to ensure qualified deaf applicants to Gallaudet) and ASL interpreter training in Hawaii (to bolster ASL more broadly).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"08bcce3976b6d8764054002c9b41493c2535070c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08bcce3976b6d8764054002c9b41493c2535070c/0_29_5311_3187/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Linda Lambrecht and Emily Jo Noschese speaking in Hawaii Sign Language in Honolulu\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Linda Lambrecht having a conversation in Hawaii Sign Language, Honolulu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eugene Tanner Photography, LLC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>ASL may now be going global, but the language is at least partly rooted in local sign languages that have long since gone extinct. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_French_Sign_Language\">French Sign Language</a> was the first modern, \u201cmethodical\u201d sign language, codified in the 1760s and 70s for formal instruction from existing signs used in the Deaf community of Paris by the <a href=\"http://giving.gallaudet.edu/HOF/pastinductees/the-abbe-charles-michel-de-lepee\">Abb\u00e9 Charles-Michel de l\u2019\u00c9p\u00e9e</a>. When America\u2019s first school for the deaf opened in Hartford, Connecticut in 1817, French Sign Language was imported and likely fused with a handful of existing New England sign languages. The result was ASL. (British Sign Language, dominant in the UK but only granted official status in 2003, is not directly related to ASL.)</p> <p>Today, there are at least 500,000 ASL signers in the US, while ASL and ASL-derived sign languages are also widespread across the Caribbean, the Pacific and much of Africa and south-east Asia. The language\u2019s increasing dominance in countries on every continent reflects the strength of Deaf culture in America and the role that well-meaning American missionaries and educators have played in spreading Deaf education through ASL.</p> <p>In the past, James Woodward told me, missionaries would often tell deaf people in other countries that they didn\u2019t have a language. \u201cIt\u2019s improving now,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I saw that going on as late as 1999 in Thailand, when some Americans came over. I think there\u2019s a growing awareness in the Deaf community in the US of how ASL has really endangered many other sign languages, and even destroyed some.\u201d</p> <p>As with English, prestige plays a major role in the growth of ASL. The linguist Victoria Nyst has written that \u201csigners in West Africa tend to perceive ASL-based sign languages as being superior to sign languages of local origin.\u201d Similarly, Misella Tomita, a young Gallaudet graduate from Hawaii, described visiting the Netherlands and seeing everyone using ASL rather than Dutch Sign Language: \u201cI felt like ASL is taking over the world.\u201d Closer to home, Woodward has studied Black ASL, which seems to have evolved in the second half of the 19th century at segregated deaf schools in the southern US. The dialect, which is an inspiration to Lambrecht, carries a heavy stigma and has become highly endangered. Almost all black signers now use standard ASL.</p> <p>At the Hawaii School for the Deaf and Blind, ASL became the standard in 1960. Today, more than half the teachers are Deaf and students are expected to sign ASL while learning to read and write English. HSL is only used, occasionally, by one dedicated teacher, and Linda\u2019s proposal to teach the language there was turned down.</p> <p>\u201cI think ASL is the reason for the decline of HSL,\u201d Woodward told me matter-of-factly, but then added: \u201cYou can\u2019t really separate the personal issues from the linguistic issues.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The impending disappearance of a language puts enormous stress on a community. For years, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/13/mexico-language-ayapaneco-dying-out\">last two fluent speakers of Ayapaneco in Mexico</a> were not on speaking terms, until outside pressures and incentives convinced them to reconcile. According to William O\u2019Grady, one language with just 60 speakers has four competing writing systems. In any community that speaks an endangered language, there are often groups who think the language is not worth saving. \u201cBut usually when it\u2019s too late, there\u2019s a deep sense of regret,\u201d O\u2019Grady said.</p> <p>In Hawaii, the remaining community of HSL signers is deeply divided. Lambrecht is the face of the language, but as a past president of the Aloha State Association of the Deaf (ASAD), she is on the opposite \u201cside\u201d from many of the older signers, who belong to a group known as the Diamond Head School Alumni (after the former name of the deaf school).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The impending disappearance of a language puts stress on a community. The remaining HSL speakers are deeply divided</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The two organisations are the institutional expression of a seemingly intractable split in the Deaf community that dates back to at least the 1970s. Some explain it as generational, historical and linguistic, but it is also personal, visceral and mysteriously self-perpetuating. In 2014, when the deaf school marked its 100th anniversary, there were two separate celebrations: one for the Diamond Head group, one for the group Lambrecht is a part of. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s just natural now, this fighting,\u201d Lopez told me.</p> <p>Because HSL was in retreat by the 1950s, most younger Deaf people can hardly sign in the language \u2013 there was virtually nowhere for them to pick it up. Many take great pride in their identity as Deaf Hawaiians and emphatically support HSL as a symbol of that identity. But some of the most fluent of the older HSL signers, in the Diamond Head group, are deeply ambivalent about reviving the language. \u201cEven though they use it in their conversations, they don\u2019t feel that HSL is a real language,\u201d said Darlene Ewan, a community activist who teaches at the deaf school.</p> <p>Early on, Wanda Andrew, who is part of the Diamond Head group, warned off the researchers: \u201cI said, \u2018To tell you the truth, for HSL it\u2019s too late, it\u2019s dead,\u2019\u201d she told me. \u201cThe loss of HSL is sad, but it was just sort of a mixture of everything, like chop suey, just kind of like an accent.\u201d For Andrew, who is in her 70s, ASL enabled a cosmopolitan life, from studies at Gallaudet to decades on the mainland and eventual marriage to a Deaf Australian man.</p> <p>Explaining why some keep their distance from the project, Andrew added that \u201cPeople will just say they don\u2019t want to, because they don\u2019t want to work with Linda.\u201d She continued, \u201cAnd if they don\u2019t remember [signs], then they just don\u2019t remember [them]. Or they might be afraid of what it\u2019s for, or they don\u2019t want to feel dumb\u2026 I don\u2019t support Linda, I think she\u2019s a little narcissistic.\u201d</p> <p>Others close to the Diamond Head group agreed that personal animosity and questions of authority \u2013 whose signs to record and revitalise? \u2013 are part of the problem. Lambrecht\u2019s supporters counter that she has almost single-handedly led the revitalisation effort. Lambrecht herself points to the lingering power of the stigma: \u201cHSL is in their hearts, but they\u2019re resistant. They want to be modern.\u201d</p> <p>The divide, which has implications for how the language is documented, is now reflected in a similar rift between the researchers. Earth and Woodward now acknowledge that ASL must have had a deeper impact than was initially understood, obliterating HSL and leaving in its place a hybrid of ASL and HSL that Woodward calls CHSL (Creolised HSL).</p> <p>Earth believes that when signers refer to HSL today, they may actually mean CHSL \u2013 a view Woodward does not share.After meeting more members of the Diamond Head group, Earth argues that CHSL is the only thing left: \u201cI have never seen pure HSL. Fewer and fewer old folks retain strong HSL elements\u2026 They cannot recover pure HSL because they never knew it.\u201d Woodward counters that \u201cthe past two years have shown that Lambrecht is using a different language from CHSL\u201d \u2013 during recording sessions where Earth, increasingly estranged from the project, was not present.</p> <p>The signs for \u201cblue\u201d, \u201cgreen\u201d and \u201cyellow\u201d have become a particular flashpoint in this dispute. Woodward argues that Lambrecht\u2019s distinctive signs for these colour terms make semantic sense, because they are clearly related to the HSL signs for \u201cwater\u201d, \u201cbamboo\u201d and \u201cpineapple\u201d. But other signers were incredulous, saying they had never seen the signs before and suggesting that they might be specific to Lambrecht or her family. Their own signs for those colours were basically ASL, and they couldn\u2019t remember any others that might be original to HSL. Earth felt that the pressure to find such \u201coriginal\u201d non-ASL signs risked distorting the research.</p> <p>\u201cIf no other person has a sign and Linda has a sign, I don\u2019t know what else to do except use her sign,\u201d said Woodward, who worked with the last known signer of Chiang Mai Sign Language in northern Thailand before he died of complications from diabetes in early 2015. Lambrecht\u2019s signs for \u201cblue\u201d, \u201cgreen\u201d, and \u201cyellow\u201d are likely to be the standard for teaching HSL going forward. \u201cIf there\u2019s only one person left,\u201d Woodward said, \u201cthen that\u2019s what you have to document.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Now in its final month, the three-year project to document and revitalise HSL has made progress, but the hardest work remains ahead. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to do everything we wanted,\u201d Woodward told me recently. He is applying to the Endangered Languages Documentation Programme for a six-month grant extension. Even now, he said, the team is still finding new signs.</p> <p>While she continues her work with Woodward, Lambrecht is looking beyond Hawaii, since ASL is spreading to other islands across the Pacific: \u201cI want to tell people there: it\u2019s not that you\u2019re stuck with your local sign language, you can borrow signs from ASL, but please don\u2019t throw out your local language.\u201d Woodward believes that many of the Pacific\u2019s innumerable islands had, or may still have, traditional, indigenous sign languages of their own \u2013 he has already identified one on Majuro, one of the Marshall Islands.</p> <p>\u201cTime is passing quickly,\u201d Lambrecht said the last time I talked to her. The oldest signer who had joined the project, a Japanese-Hawaiian woman named Mildred, was dying. \u201cI remember Mildred would always tell me, \u2018I don\u2019t like HSL, I like ASL, it\u2019s for educated people like me,\u2019 and I would say, \u2018No, no, no, it\u2019s our local language!\u2019\u201d Mildred was seen as one of HSL\u2019s remaining masters, but she had been reluctant to sign for the camera when I visited last year.</p> <p>Then in February, Linda told me, Mildred had a bad fall and went to the hospital. She couldn\u2019t walk and was now under hospice care, living with her son. Linda visited her recently: \u201cI saw her signing \u2013 and I noticed that she had reverted to HSL. We were just shocked. The others didn\u2019t understand her, I said let me translate. Now when I visit her I try to catch every story I can, while she\u2019s still here. Next time I go I really want to bring the camera and record her.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p>",

  "<p>She thrashed her legs during those last few strokes of Tuesday night\u2019s 200m freestyle final and Katie Ledecky\u2019s body ached like it never had before in these Olympics. Her rival Sarah Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m was somewhere, either ahead or behind. She had no idea. So she kept pushing her arms her feet, her stomach until near the end she burped. And as she did she thought she would vomit in the water for all the world to see on live television.</p> <p>When Ledecky finished and realized her quest to be the second woman to take gold in the 200m, 400m and 800m at the same Olympics was still alive, she was not elated. She didn\u2019t pump her fist or shout. \u201cI was done when I hit the wall,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was a really tough race \u2026 the closest I\u2019ve come to throwing up.\u201d</p> <p>Ledecky makes winning gold look so easy it\u2019s hard to forget the agony she puts herself through in every race. The 200m is her toughest challenge \u2013 a sprint for a body designed to outlast everybody in the longer distances. Her lust to seize those three golds extracts an excruciating price in the pool. She almost welcomes the pain It\u2019s a symbol of accomplishment, a sign that she wasted nothing. \u201cIt meant I had pushed as hard as I could,\u201d she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/09/simone-biles-us-team-gymnastics-gold\">Simone Biles helps USA to team gymnastics gold \u2013 and targets four more | Bryan Armen Graham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She did not feel this way on Sunday night when she won the 400m freestyle with relative ease. This was a fight, a battle she wasn\u2019t even sure she could win. After her qualifying race the day before, one in which she came in behind Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, she saw on video that she had taken too many strokes. She wanted to control that pace on Tuesday. And yet once the race started she didn\u2019t feel as if she had been perfect. Her second turn was too wide. She was tired. She was worried. She wondered just how far she might have fallen behind. But because she does not look to her right when she races she could not see Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m in the lane beside her.<br></p> <p>All she could do was try to squelch the dinner that was bubbling up in her throat and pray it didn\u2019t spill into the water. \u201cI\u2019ve come pretty close in practice a few times so I\u2019m kind of used to it,\u201d Ledecky said after the race. \u201cAnd I know I can get through it and it\u2019s almost like you get mad when that happens and I swim better when I get mad so I just sucked deep and knew I had only 25m left.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61e4dcb3ce017925e249e92d296effb6c0b91d63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61e4dcb3ce017925e249e92d296effb6c0b91d63/0_136_5432_3259/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katie Ledecky claims her second gold of the Games.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katie Ledecky claims her second gold of the Games.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Pretty/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whether it was will or fury, she has taken golds in her first two Rio finals. She is now the third woman and sixth swimmer overall to win gold in the 200m and 400m in the same Olympics. The only other females are the American, Debbie Meyer, who did it in 1968, and Shane Gould who accomplished the feat in 1972. That means it\u2019s been 44 years since a woman has done what she did these last few days. <br></p> <p>The great prize is Meyer\u2019s three golds in Mexico City \u2013 the 200m, 400m and 800m trifecta. Since the 200m is Ledecky\u2019s worst event it\u2019s safe to assume she has an excellent shot at the 800m. But it depends on the torture with which she has subjected her body. Will she have enough for the 800m on Thursday night? This is what she has trained these last four years to do.<br></p> <p>She knows Meyer, and the two have spoken about her pursuit. Meyer has told her she wants her to win the three races. \u201cI don\u2019t want to let her down,\u201d Ledecky said.</p> <p>The irony of Ledecky\u2019s stress is that Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m felt the same thing. The Swede knew she had a chance to beat Ledecky in the final and she pushed hard to catch her. At one point, she got a wave generated by Ledecky\u2019s body and rode it a bit, finding an extra burst from her opponent. In the end it wasn\u2019t enough, beaten by the reach of a finger. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anything to give the last 50m,\u201d Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m said.</p> <p>When the race was over, Ledecky stood in a hallway beneath the Olympic Aquatics Center and watched team-mate Michael Phelps win the 200m butterfly on a television. She was perhaps more nervous watching him than racing herself. She put her hand over her mouth, then on her head and over her mouth again. She agonized over a race she didn\u2019t even swim. There seemed irony in this. The next great Olympic swimming champion watching America\u2019s greatest champion celebrate in a way only both of them can. </p>",

This is not like us. One of the great questions that hovers over this system is how we can allow it to go on \u2013 how we can know so much about our prisons on Manus and Nauru yet manage not to face the facts of the Pacific solution. </p> <p>Put simply: we think the horrors are worth it. First because both sides of politics tell us that only by detaining refugees out there will the boats stop coming here. And second, we\u2019re assured there is somewhere in the world ready to take our prisoners off our hands.</p> <p>Those are both lies.</p> <p>The boats are stopped because they are turned back. They are still setting out from Sri Lanka, Vietnam, India and Indonesia, hoping to ferry asylum seekers to Australia. In June, both the prime minister and the minister for immigration, Peter Dutton, boasted they\u2019d turned back their 28th boat.</p> <p>If the smugglers\u2019 customers knew about the prisons on Manus and Nauru \u2013 widely and expensively advertised by Australia \u2013 they were not deterred from risking an expensive voyage by fear of ending up there.</p> <p>Australian Border Force and the navy stopped them reaching Australia. Turnbacks have their own horrors and present diplomatic dangers for this country, but there is no doubt they work \u2013 just as they did last time under John Howard.</p> <p>The second lie is worse: that some country will take the prisoners on Manus and Nauru off our hands.

That is what really moves the public, when they actually see, preferably on video, how these children are being treated.\u201d</p> <p>Elaine Pearson, the Australian director of Human Rights Watch, said the Don Dale images shocked the Turnbull government into action, and called for the same in response to the evidence presented in the Nauru files and in other investigations.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that the number of serious incidents has not declined but continued steadily, and in some cases escalated, is further proof that the failure to address abuses is a deliberate policy of the Australian government to deter further boat arrivals,\u201d Pearson told Guardian Australia. </p> <p>\u201cAustralia\u2019s policy of deterrence is premised on making people in offshore locations suffer.

There is a real hypocrisy in the fact we have two royal commissions currently afoot \u2013 one into institutional child sexual abuse and another into youth detention centres \u2013 and yet at the very same time we\u2019re warehousing children on Nauru in conditions that allow this kind of abuse to thrive.\u201d</p> <p>De Kretser said there needed to be a full inquiry but the safety of people on the islands or at risk of being sent to the islands was the first priority.</p> <p>\u201cWe have the evidence now and the first thing the government has to do is act on that evidence and bring these people here to safety.\u201d</p>",
