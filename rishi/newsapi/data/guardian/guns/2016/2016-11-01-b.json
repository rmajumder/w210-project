  "<p>If anyone is equipped to prosper at England\u2019s training camp in Portugal it is Tom Wood. As well as offering the extra lineout option Eddie Jones may yet need against South Africa next week, the Northampton flanker boasts a black belt in jujutsu which should give him a slight advantage when England return to their judo mats in the Algarve this week.</p> <p>The multidimensional Wood, who also enjoys archery and off-roading, was a keen martial arts exponent as a youngster before he entered full-time rugby. \u201cI started at seven or eight,\u201d he said. \u201cI did a bit of karate to start with before some new guys came into our club with a jujutsu background. I did it until I was 13 and was a black belt. I loved it at the time until rugby got a bit too serious.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/oct/31/eddie-jones-league-coach-brutal-england-defence-training\">Eddie Jones flies in league coach to instil \u2018brutal\u2019 England defence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Given Jones\u2019s enthusiasm for judo-based training, despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/06/anthony-watson-out-of-england-autumn-internationals-with-broken-jaw-bath-rugby-union\" title=\"\">a flurry of injuries at England\u2019s last get-together in Brighton</a>, it could be that Wood, who turns 30 on Thursday, has finally re-emerged in the right place at the right time following a year\u2019s exile from the national squad. Jones was impressed with his latest contribution for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/28/northampton-gloucester-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">the Saints in the win over Gloucester last Friday</a> and likes the attitude of the long-haired warrior \u2013 \u201cHe looks like Rambo, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d \u2013 who last featured for England at the 2015 Rugby World Cup.</p> <p>Wood was as deflated as anyone by the host nation\u2019s premature exit from the tournament but, having been bluntly told by Jones he needed to improve in all areas \u2013 he was informed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/06/tom-wood-eddie-jones-england-northampton\" title=\"\">the new England coach his form had been \u201cdistinctly average\u201d</a> \u2013 his determination to fight his way back has not gone unnoticed.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t throw my toys out of the pram,\u201d said Wood, who has won 42 caps and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/08/england-tom-wood-argentina-chris-robshaw\" title=\"\">captained England against Argentina in 2013</a>. \u201cThe reality was I wasn\u2019t picked because what he had seen from me hadn\u2019t been good enough at that stage.</p> <p>\u201cA lot was made about that at the time but I was never having a tantrum. I was simply stating that what he had seen from me was average, it wasn\u2019t good enough and that if I wanted to get in the England team I had to improve. Eddie is very straight-talking. He says it how it is at the time and then moves on pretty quickly. He has been all smiles since I\u2019ve been here.\u201d</p> <p>With a fitness doubt still hanging over Courtney Lawes and with Maro Itoje, James Haskell and Jack Clifford also sidelined, it is more than possible Jones will be tempted by Wood\u2019s lineout expertise when he finalises his matchday 23 to play the Springboks on Saturday week.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why I can\u2019t fulfil a role in the back row, whatever it is,\u201d added Wood. \u201cIt might be off the bench. I have to get in the squad first but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be ready if required. I knew it may take an injury or 10 to get me here but that\u2019s the nature of the game.\u201d</p> <p>He is also looking forward to working with England\u2019s forwards coach, Steve Borthwick, for the first time and would love to re-establish himself as a permanent member of England\u2019s back row. \u201cThe door is ajar for me. I\u2019ve got one foot through it but now I have to show what I am about in training. Hopefully I can do myself justice and we\u2019ll see where it goes from there.</p> <p>\u201cI want to get better as a player and that is one of the things Eddie Jones is massive on: having a growth mentality and improving day to day. I\u2019ve never for one second thought I was the finished article.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll always wish things had been different at that World Cup and that we were more successful but that\u2019s true of every game I lose. If and when I eventually finish with England it would be nice to finish on a high.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s quite hard to tell whether the Vigilante app is a functioning business or a teaser for a new episode of dystopian sci-fi series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/black-mirror\">Black Mirror</a>. </p> <p>Launched in New York last week, it\u2019s designed to alert nearby users whenever a crime is reported to 911. Users can use that information to avoid the danger area \u2013 or go and film it with their smartphone to broadcast the unfolding crime.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if everyone within a quarter mile of every reported crime were immediately made aware of it. What if there were a camera on every crime. What if transparency existed \u2013 if we all knew where crime was occurring and how it was being resolved. Would crime as we know it still exist?\u201d asks the company in a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@CrimeNoMore/vigilante-manifesto-e665696a4ebb#.zhytbh12v\">Medium post</a> announcing the app\u2019s launch.</p> <p>The app, created by a company called <a href=\"http://www.sp0n.com/\">Sp0n</a> (its sparse website says it makes \u201cdisruptive consumer mobile apps\u201d) was swiftly kicked off the App Store by Apple, which had \u201cconcerns\u201d about its content, according to a note on Vigilante.Live.</p> <p>The developers believe that opening up crime reporting in this way empowers people. \u201cThe closed system excludes the community while the open system informs and empowers citizens,\u201d it says.</p> <p>At the heart of Vigilante is the belief that mass surveillance makes the world a better, fairer place through the rhetorical question: can injustice survive transparency?</p> <p>\u201cThe lens of the camera is incapable of lying. When we are able to look at a situation from multiple angles, the truth emerges. Transparency is the single most powerful tool against crime and injustice, and we believe it will rebuild cooperation towards a shared vision. Cooperation, in turn, will lead to safer communities, better cities, and a stronger nation.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a utopian vision, but one that\u2019s a little confused. On one hand Vigilante talks about restoring trust between law enforcement and the community, which suggests that video streaming could help document and prevent police brutality. Yet on the other hand, it\u2019s precisely the kind of tool that could be abused to intimidate and harass innocent minorities with the kind of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/us/website-nextdoor-hears-racial-profiling-complaints.html\">racial profiling that became rampant on the Nextdoor app</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt raises all these questions around consent and sharing,\u201d said Sam Gregory, programme director of Witness, which trains and supports activists to document human rights violations.</p> <p>He is concerned about the framing of the app, down to the name and promotional materials. \u201cVigilantism is a very different idea to being an ethical witness to what\u2019s happening,\u201d he said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Vigilantism is a very different idea to being an ethical witness to what\u2019s happening</p> <footer> <cite>Sam Gregory</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThese types of tools tend to have racial bias and only focus on very visible incidents. Things you can see in the street, as we saw with Nextdoor and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/aug/12/sketchfactor-city-app-sparks-accusations-of-racism\">Sketchfactor</a>,\u201d he said. In this way, the app encourages the public incrimination of innocent-until-proven-guilty people at the scene.</p> <p>The lens of the camera may be incapable of lying, but there\u2019s always bias in the selection of subject matter. When untrained bystanders start to make judgment calls over who is at fault, there\u2019s broad scope for miscarriage of justice. He cites <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://lab.witness.org/projects/transgender-violence/executive-summary/\">research</a> into the filming of violence against transgender people and how it is shared and engaged with online as entertainment. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a tradeoff between visibility of a crime and making people who didn\u2019t want to be on camera into a public spectacle,\u201d he said.</p> <p>At the same time, smartphone-equipped vigilantes could find themselves escalating a situation the police could have dealt with easily or putting themselves in danger.</p> <p>As the New York police department told <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2016/11/01/apple-removes-vigilante-live-crime-alert-tool-from-the-app-store/\">the Verge</a>, \u201cCrimes in progress should be handled by the NYPD and not a vigilante with a cellphone.\u201d</p> <p>Apple doesn\u2019t comment on individual decisions, but the App Store has <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/\">strict rules</a> about user-generated content apps to prevent abuse or bullying. The company also rejects apps if they risk physical harm, which could be possible if a load of vigilantes took their pitchforks to a crime scene.</p> <p>\u201cOur core mission is empowering communities with technology to create safer neighborhoods,\u201d a Sp0n spokeswoman said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cThe team is working with Apple to resolve the issue and they are confident the app will be made available in the near future. Vigilante will introduce an Android version of the app in the upcoming weeks with plans to expand in additional cities later this year.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Pep Guardiola said it himself. Barcelona did not have to win this match. Manchester City did, or at least try to take something from it. But Barcelona had Lionel Messi, the one player in the world who seems capable of winning any Champions League match.</p> <p>No one needs to explain anything about Messi to anyone at City after all the previous meetings and the events at the Camp Nou, and though his appearance has changed considerably since the first glimpse in this country 10 years ago prompted Richard Williams of this parish to describe him as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/feb/24/championsleague1\" title=\"\">resembling the missing fifth member of the Monkees</a>, the potency remains the same. When Messi scored the first goal here it was hard to know what was more remarkable, the certainty that he would find the net or the knowledge that it was his seventh goal in only three Champions League games this season.</p> <p>Guardiola\u2019s regard for Messi remains undiminished, and will do after this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/01/manchester-city-barcelona-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">powerful reminder that one man does not make a team</a>. City could consider themselves fortunate that Messi was not on the end of the opportunity from which Andr\u00e9 Gomes hit the bar midway through the second half, but if the key to stopping Barcelona is keeping Messi in check, Guardiola\u2019s side managed it. \u201cThere is no defence that can stop Messi,\u201d Guardiola famously told his Bayern Munich players when they had to attempt the task. \u201cYou can try and make sure he receives that ball less but there is no system or coach to stop talent of that magnitude.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/01/manchester-city-barcelona-champions-league-match-report\">Manchester City turn on style to stun Barcelona in Champions League victory</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Put it down to an off-day, then. For though Barcelona turned up at the Etihad with a reorganised defence in the absence of Gerard Piqu\u00e9 and Jordi Alba, the front three were ominously as expected. This was only Messi\u2019s third Champions League game in the present campaign, so he was on a hat-trick of hat-tricks, having scored three goals against Celtic as well as three against Manchester City. Just in case anyone failed to notice him he was captain for the night too, as Andr\u00e9s Iniesta was sidelined through injury.</p> <p>Actually Barcelona missed Iniesta. That reliable presence just behind the front runners, the probing passes, the usual quiet control were not on display in the opening minutes. Messi\u2019s first touch of note was a ball into the box to pick out Luis Su\u00e1rez in a threatening position, though the only other Barcelona trademark to marvel at for the first quarter was a goalkeeper playing with his feet. As this is a hot topic in Manchester at the moment, it is worth noting that Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen\u2019s ball-playing ability is not restricted to wandering out of his area and making an occasional contribution as sweeper. Barcelona use him as an extra outfield player whether he is standing on his goalline or not. He has to field back-passes even when opponents are in close proximity and at one point dealt nervelessly with a free-kick played back to him at pace at waist height.</p> <p>Sweeper-keeping in the Premier League is clearly still in its infancy. Barcelona found their feet soon enough, though they could have had few complaints if City had been awarded a penalty for Samuel Umtiti\u2019s foul on Raheem Sterling with the game still scoreless. There was certainly enough contact for the referee\u2019s decision to book Sterling to look harsh, and City taking the lead at that point might have further unsettled their visitors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/nov/01/manchester-city-v-barcelona-champions-league-live\">Manchester City 3-1 Barcelona: Champions League \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As it was, Barcelona claimed the first goal from a not entirely unexpected source. Messi not only scored it but helped make it, turning defence into attack when a Sergio Ag\u00fcero shot had been blocked, feeding the ball out to Neymar on the left then continuing his run through the middle to beat Willy Caballero with his usual left-foot nonchalance. It is perhaps a measure of City\u2019s improvement under Guardiola that they managed to come back from that before the interval. There were several more scares in Caballero\u2019s goalmouth, notably when Gomes saw a shot blocked and Su\u00e1rez could not quite reach Messi\u2019s volleyed cross with a header, but the home side were able to withstand the pressure until Ilkay G\u00fcndogan\u2019s goal put them back on terms.</p> <p>If Sergi Roberto was at fault for the equaliser it was Sergio Busquets who gave away the free-kick on David Silva from which Kevin De Bruyne gave City the lead, claiming to have won the ball but guilty of bundling over the man in the process. Then came Barcelona\u2019s best chance, Gomes crashing the ball against the bar after successive mistakes by John Stones and Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi, though in all fairness City were making chances for fun at the other end and could have made the game safe before G\u00fcndogan scored his second.</p> <p>Both defences were suspect, neither side was clinical in attack, there were opportunities aplenty in a game that at times was as knockabout as a Premier League match. Barcelona purists will probably regard that as an insult. City supporters can, however, quite rightly feel proud.</p>",
  "<h2>What\u2019s going on with Bob Day?</h2> \n<p>The Family First senator has resigned from the Senate in response to the collapse of his home-building business. There is a standard procedure for replacing senators who resign mid-term, but questions have now been raised as to whether Day was eligible to be elected at the last election under section 44 of the constitution. The answer to these questions will determine who gets to fill Day\u2019s seat.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/02/what-did-you-know-and-when-labor-wants-government-answers-on-bob-day-fiasco\">'What did you know and when?': Labor wants government answers on Bob Day fiasco</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>What is section 44 of the constitution?</strong></h2> \n<p>Section 44 governs whether a person is eligible to be elected and serve as a member of the federal parliament.

Day doesn't want to use former senator Don Farrell's old office in Adelaide CBD (already leased at $99,000 pa until mid-2016). In&nbsp;<b>February 2014,</b>&nbsp;finance officials tell then-special minister of state Michael Ronaldson they do not recommend establishing a new office for Day. They note Day owns the building and intends to sell it on condition the office is leased to the commonwealth, and write: 'Finance has concerns about how such a transaction might be perceived.'</p>\n     <p>Ronaldson tells Day in <b>March 2014&nbsp;</b>he can move but the commonwealth won't pay his rent while the Adelaide CBD office lease is still in place.&nbsp;Day agrees to terms for Fullarton Road lease including rent-free period while the CBD office is empty. On&nbsp;<b>4 August 2016</b>&nbsp;Day approaches the new special minister of state Scott Ryan about rent on the office. Ryan seeks further information and discovers there may be a constitutional breach. Ryan terminates the lease on&nbsp;<b>7 October 2016&nbsp;</b>and seeks independent legal advice from constitutional law expert David Jackson. On&nbsp;<b>27 October 2016&nbsp;</b>Ryan receives legal advice regarding the possible invalid election of Day - concerns over indirect pecuniary interest because building owner owes Day money. Day says he has legal advice there is no breach because he does not have a contract or agreement with the commonwealth.</p>\n     <p><br></p>\n    </div> \n   </figure> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The \u201coffice of profit\u201d rule has also kicked out a number of MPs who were elected while serving as public servants. Independent MP Phil Cleary was removed from his seat shortly before the 1993 election as he was a teacher on unpaid leave at the time of his election. Liberal MP Jackie Kelly lost her seat shortly after the 1996 election due to her being an employee of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and holding New Zealand citizenship. Both members went on to win re-election after being ruled ineligible. Liberal senator Jeannie Ferris resigned and was reappointed in 1996 after questions were raised about her employment in the office of another senator at the time of her election.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n<p>After a rush of cases in the 1990s, no further members of parliament have faced challenges under section 44.<br></p> \n<h2>Why does it matter if Day is ineligible if he\u2019s leaving anyway?</h2> \n<p>It matters because the seat will be filled in different ways depending on whether Day, a South Australia senator, was eligible.</p> \n<p>If Day was eligible to take his seat, and then resigns, the seat will be filled according to the standard process. Day\u2019s Family First party will nominate a successor, and a joint sitting of the South Australian state parliament will approve that person.</p> \n<p>If the high court finds that Day was not eligible to take his seat in the first place, it seems likely that the seat will instead be decided by a recount of the Senate ballots from the election. When the high court found Robert Wood and Heather Hill ineligible to be elected in 1988 and 1998 respectively, a recount was conducted to fill their seats. In both cases, the seat went to the second candidate on their party\u2019s ticket.</p> \n<h2>So who is most likely to win the seat now?</h2> \n<p>If there is a recount, it is most likely that Family First will hold on to the Senate seat, but they won\u2019t have any choice over who will take the seat \u2013 the winner would be Day\u2019s running mate Lucy Gichuhi, a Kenyan-born lawyer.</p> \n<p>Grahame Bowland, a political analyst, has taken the raw voting data from the 2016 election and run the count with Bob Day excluded, and found that Gichuhi wins the seat.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/\">ABC elections analyst Antony Green</a> has questioned whether Gichuhi is eligible to receive most of Day\u2019s votes. Parties are required to have two candidates in a group to receive above-the-line preferences and the Family First group only has one when Bob Day is excluded. If Family First\u2019s above-the-line votes are distributed to the next party on the preference order, Labor would win the seat in a close race with One Nation.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n<p>It seems unlikely that Family First will miss out on the seat due to this technicality. A similar issue arose in 1988, when the Nuclear Disarmament party group was reduced to one candidate, and the high court ruled that the second candidate could still receive above-the-line preferences. While the law is slightly different now, this precedent would be strong.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/01/bob-day-senate-election-family-first-labor-coalition-high-court\">Coalition and Labor query whether Bob Day's election to Senate was valid</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>If Day is not ruled out and Family First get to choose the candidate instead of there being a recount, it is very unlikely to opt for Gichuhi, with the frontrunners being Day\u2019s chief of staff, Rikki Lambert, and the Family First state MP Robert Brokenshire. </p> \n<h2>What happens now?</h2> \n<p> Day has been one of the most pro-government members of the Senate crossbench and there\u2019s no guarantee his successor will have the same approach; the government may find its task of passing legislation more difficult.</p> \n<p>Regardless of the result, the court hearing will delay the filling of Day\u2019s seat, leaving the Coalition without a crucial vote for at least a few more weeks.<br></p>",

Ludogorets 2-3 Arsenal (Mesut Ozil, 87 min)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Mesut Ozil has surely won it for Arsenal and sent them into the last 16 with a magnificent goal! Out of nowhere, he\u2019s released through the middle by Elneny, making an instant impact, Ludogorets getting it all wrong with a dismal attempt at an offside trap. Borjan hurtles out of his area and the ball is bouncing awkwardly. So Ozil simply scoops it over him with his left foot, a little like Messi against Arsenal in 2011, and advances towards the area.

The Bulgarians fancy their chances going forward.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5818f766e4b029b92ca44762\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T20:13:50.750Z\">8.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>28 min:</strong> It\u2019s so cold in Sofia that they\u2019ve all covered themselves with blankets on the Arsenal bench.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5818f715e4b07ceadb3a15b1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T20:12:28.704Z\">8.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>27 min: </strong>Sanchez drops deep and pings a diagonal ball towards Giroud.

Fine, it\u2019s not news. But that doesn\u2019t mean a chill didn\u2019t go down the spine of every sensible Arsenal supporter this morning. This, after all, has traditionally been the month when a few things start to go wrong in their season and a fine, encouraging start gives way to angst and anger and the occasional level-headed debate on ArsenalFanTV about whether Arsene Wenger is a TREACHEROUS DISGRACE WHO NEEDS TO GET OUT OF MY CLUB NOW or AN UNDISPUTED LEGEND WHO CAN DO NO WRONG. If Arsenal happen to lose to Ludogorets tonight, do keep an eye on YouTube later, it\u2019s bound to be entertaining.</p> <p>The stats aren\u2019t too encouraging. November has long been the worst month in Arsenal\u2019s season under Wenger, their points per game in the Premier League dropping to an average of 1.59. How to explain it? Some put it down to injuries, others say it\u2019s because they\u2019re too often gripped by the need to avert catastrophe in their Champions League group. Maybe it\u2019s a protest against daylight saving. Whatever the reason, though, they could do without another mini collapse this time, because they\u2019ve been building some impressive momentum since losing to Liverpool on the opening day of the season. Unbeaten in all competitions since that 4-3 defeat, they\u2019re level with Liverpool and Manchester City at the top of the Premier League, lead their Champions League group on goal difference and have been playing some scintillating football.</p> <p>Don\u2019t stop now. That\u2019ll be Wenger\u2019s message to his players. A big month begins with them taking on Ludogorets in Sofia and they need to keep accelerating. Victory over a side who were walloped 6-0 at the Emirates a fortnight ago will keep them above Paris Saint-Germain in the battle to win Group A, thus improving their chances of an easier draw in the last 16, and ensure that there\u2019s no loss of confidence before Sunday\u2019s North London derby. With games against Manchester United and PSG to come later this month, Arsenal can\u2019t afford to let bad habits creep back into their system. There haven\u2019t been too many signs of their focus dropping in recent weeks \u2013 but they would be foolish to approach this game with a complacent attitude.

  "<p>Britain found itself in a subservient, as much as a special, relationship with the US over the invasion and occupation of Iraq from 2003 and was rarely able to overturn sometimes ill-informed American decision-making, the lead British administrator in Iraq in 2004 has claimed.</p> <p>Giving a unique insight into the realities of the UK-US relationship at a time of stress, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, a former UK ambassador to the UN and one of Britain\u2019s most highly regarded diplomats, suggested that British influence over the US during the war was at the margins.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/01/iraqi-troops-enter-mosul-first-time-since-2014\">Iraqi troops enter Mosul for first time since 2014</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe were in the second-class carriage not driving the engine,\u201d he said, adding that the US administrators \u201csaw Iraq as an American project in every sense that mattered and only Americans \u2013 and the right Americans at that \u2013 were qualified to conduct it\u201d.</p> <p>Greenstock said the shadow of the war still hung over contemporary politics, and even the current isolationism in the UK revealed in the Brexit vote could be traced back to \u201cthe British public\u2019s distaste for the Iraq war\u201d. \u201cThe elite and the superpower is no longer accepted,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In his book Iraq: the Cost of War and accompanying Guardian interview, Greenstock also suggested that the rebellion against Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad may have happened regardless, but said the \u201cpredatory emergence of al-Qaida and then Islamic State at the heart of the Syrian opposition was made far more likely by the survival of [Isis leader] Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Iraq and by the battle-hardening experience of the resistance there\u201d.</p> <p>Greenstock abandoned plans to publish the book in 2005 after complaints from the then foreign secretary, Jack Straw, but it has now been released with Whitehall consent following publication of the Chilcot report in the summer. Sir John Chilcot is due to give evidence to parliament\u2019s liaison committee on Wednesday.</p> <p>Greenstock said the Iraq episode had done immense damage to US standing. \u201cTo most people on the planet now it is unacceptable for the US on its own to interpret international legitimacy.\u201d</p> <p>Due to wider changes in society, he claimed, \u201cAmerica\u2019s pure moral authority is no longer greater than if it was a small island state\u201d.</p> <p>The whole US Iraq effort was dysfunctional, he said, because the political and military wings were not unified, and there was an optimism culture that discouraged open debate. Colin Powell, the then secretary of state, took to reading UK rather than US telegrams from Baghdad to find out the the truth of the chaos in Iraq. Greenstock likened the US\u2019s Baghdad-based Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) to \u201ca cowboy operation\u201d, adding that its size was that of an embassy rather than a functioning government, its true role in the wake of the invasion.</p> <p>In one of the cardinal themes of the book, Greenstock argued: \u201cThroughout the whole Iraq saga the UK never had a significant impact on US policy formulation.\u201d<br></p> <p>He added: \u201cWe have got to understand that, for all the rhetoric, we have different backgrounds, different values, different working methods, different psychologies, in approaching a serious military or politico-military operation; that not only is it quite difficult to inter-operate with the Americans, but that Americans don\u2019t inter-operate well with each other.<br></p> <p>\u201cAmerica will make its decisions on American advice, within American procedures and politics. They do not close doors, but they do not open the doors where the final decisions are made. It would not have occurred to Donald Rumsfeld to consult the British every time he took a corner on the road.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17c52671f2cf46f6e5392cdbcdf293f1063a33bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17c52671f2cf46f6e5392cdbcdf293f1063a33bc/0_77_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Bremer (right) jealously guarded decision-making, according to Greenstock.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Bremer (right) jealously guarded decision-making, according to Greenstock.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marco Di Lauro/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said: \u201cI sensed from the main UK official, Nigel Sheinwald, who was in constant conversation with the US national security adviser, Condi Rice, that there were limits on what we could say to Washington. So many things were going wrong in 2004, Britain could not raise them all at the same time. It is a junior cousin status, and you can only play the relationship for as far as the elastic will give.\u201d</p> <p>An additional problem was that the UK\u2019s excellent contacts with the US state department were redundant due to postwar planning being handed to the Pentagon, where UK contacts with the true decision-makers were very thin.</p> <p>Tony Blair, Greenstock said, was constantly having to judge how much to load on to any one conversation with George W Bush for fear the door would be slammed shut. Greenstock suggested: \u201cPerhaps because we have adopted the role of first ally, we over-expect that we have some privileges in the decision-making process.\u201d Greenstock felt forced to remind UK cabinet ministers that although Britain might want 50% of the influence it only provided 2% of the resources in the war.</p> <p>Greenstock added: \u201cI personally believe that the prime minister liked to avoid rows, and therefore he wasn\u2019t going to take things through to a hard argument with Washington.\u201d</p> <p>He said Blair\u2019s senior advisers were exasperated because the prime minister would not draw a clear line on what the UK was prepared to do.</p> <p>The UK was not consulted on key decisions such as the appointment of the CPA leadership, the decision to stay in Iraq until elections were held or the orders requiring tens of thousands of Ba\u2019ath party officials to be sacked, he said.</p> <p>\u201cBush got the mission wrong,\u201d Greenstock said. \u201cIt was too narrowly focused on getting rid of Saddam Hussein and not the next stage, otherwise he would have insisted on a different military mission. The Brits were too trusting in assuming the Americans had thought what sort of Iraq they wanted.\u201d</p> <p>He revealed that as UK representative to the CPA in Baghdad he was ordered by Paul Bremer, the lead US CPA official, to be loyal to the US. He said he was systematically excluded from all meetings on oil contracts, electricity, money, and prisons. He was also excluded from most meetings on US intelligence or security.</p> <p>He claimed Bremer\u2019s \u201cjealous guardianship of decision-making shut out the kind of brainstorming discussion at which the UK made the best contributions\u201d.</p> <p>In his sharpest criticism of Blair, he said the prime minister allowed his reasons for going to go to war to shift from British to US reasons, so embracing the concept of regime change. This disturbed his closest advisers and led to his wider unpopularity, he claims. <br></p> <p>Greenstock exonerated Blair from the charge of committing himself to war regardless of Saddam\u2019s behaviour or deliberately misleading the public about Saddam\u2019s possession of biological weapons. He said Blair would have preferred a peaceful outcome with compliance by Saddam with the UN weapons inspectors. He claimed that as late as weeks before the war started Blair would have been overjoyed if Bush had said he would delay the invasion.</p> <p>\u201cThe prime minister would have been, if he had been in sole control of this, much more comfortable with making a decision on war after the summer [of 2003] than before the summer. But there was no way that we were going to get that out of the Americans. So in that sense we were on a timetable of American making, which we couldn\u2019t escape from, and therefore the prime minister\u2019s decision was absolutely black or white. Either he went with them or he did not. He didn\u2019t have a third route.\u201d</p> <p>He claimed the British were willing to fly blind alongside the Americans, and that they were totally unprepared for the occupation and had not adequately assessed the risks or the need to ensure security after the fall of Saddam. He also suggested Blair did not make sure the UK government addressed the crisis as it developed in 2004. \u201cWhat I thought was structurally weak was that there was no clear political responsibility taken at an elected level below the prime minister in London,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He wrote scathingly: \u201cChoices were made with a best-case scenario, with no insurance policy in place for the worst outcome. The US suffered a \u2018reveal no weakness\u2019 mode with no one clearly accountable for the results. The Americans worked on an assumption that difficulties did not require a deep analysis and no one could in the end resist American power.</p> <p>\u201cThe reliance on one channel of Iraqi exile advice, together with the failure to examine the conflicting forces inside Iraq itself with all the American expertise available, led to the decision to commit the post-conflict administration to such a small team, one that had no experience of political planning and did not attract the respect and attention of the US administration. The emphasis lay on what the US does best: war. No one really knew what would happen in the aftermath.</p> <p>\u201cAs a result a security vacuum developed, the country became awash with arms and many of the civil servants that ran the country were rendered redundant, breeding resentment.\u201d</p>",

I think you have to be realistic, but the idea is to keep that pipeline of players coming in.\u201d</p> <p>Celtic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/19/celtic-borussia-monchengladbach-champions-league-match-report\">were beaten 2-0 by M\u00f6nchengladbach</a> a fortnight ago with the visitors more than worth their win. \u201cThey reinforced that they are a very good side even with players missing.

It is a step up even from that, the intensity, the quality, the speed.</p> <p>\u201cWe are taking a couple of jumps up to that level.

  "<p>Ukip leadership favourite Paul Nuttall has praised Nigel Farage\u2019s controversial anti-migrant poster, saying it made an \u201cabsolutely correct\u201d point that there is a \u201cdeluge of people coming from the Middle East\u201d.<br></p> <p>Nuttall, the former deputy leader, backed the poster during a hustings event for Ukip leadership candidates on radio station LBC, which descended into bickering and acrimony over issues ranging from homophobia to the death penalty.</p> <p>\u201cThe point behind that poster was absolutely correct. We do need to get control of our borders and there is a deluge of people coming from the Middle East. And the EU\u2019s idea of a common asylum policy isn\u2019t the route to go down,\u201d he said when asked for his views on the campaign image.</p> <p>He also said there had only been a slight increase in hate crime following Brexit, while arguing that it was not out of the ordinary because it \u201chappens after any national event\u201d.</p> <p>A different position was taken by Suzanne Evans, the former deputy chairman of the party, who said the poster was unnecessary though not racist.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like it. I thought it was insensitive and ill judged,\u201d she said. </p> <p>The poster, which Farage unveiled during the EU referendum campaign, showed a queue of mostly non-white migrants and refugees with the slogan \u201cBreaking point: the EU has failed us all\u201d. It was condemned at the time by an array of politicians from leading Brexiter Michael Gove to former chancellor George Osborne.<br></p> <p>The leadership contest was triggered by Farage\u2019s departure after the referendum and then the refusal of Diane James to serve after she was elected the new Ukip leader in the first race to succeed him.</p> <p>The candidates were mostly in agreement about the need to unite the party after a year of bitter infighting but there were palpable tensions during the hustings, largely directed at John Rees-Evans, the least known of the four candidates, who hit the headlines in 2014 for claiming that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/22/gay-donkey-rapists-other-odddities-how-ukip-keeps-going-off-message\">a gay donkey tried to rape his horse</a>.</p> <p>He clashed with LBC presenter Iain Dale after he criticised Evans for calling for a Ukip assembly candidate to be axed for branding LGBT activists the \u201cGaystapo\u201d.<br></p> <p> \u201cIt is entirely acceptable for a Ukip candidate to have any views that he likes,\u201d said Rees-Evans, who called for members to set party policies through direct democracy.</p> <p>He also suggested he could back the death penalty for paedophiles convicted of sexual crimes with prepubescent children.</p> <p>\u201cThere would need to be some pretty strict criteria in terms of the burden of evidence but yes ... In the case of specifically paedophiles and child killers,\u201d he said, adding that it would not for example apply to someone convicted of a sexual crime with a teenager who looked 18 but was actually 15 and a half.</p> <p>Nuttall said he would vote in a referendum on the death penalty for it to apply to child murderers such as Ian Huntley, while Evans and Peter Whittle said they did not support the death penalty.</p> <p>Nuttall, who is the strong favourite to win, had one of the toughest messages about the party\u2019s future, saying it was \u201cpeering over a political cliff\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI will be the candidate who keeps Ukip on the pitch,\u201d Nuttall said, calling for the party to replace Labour as the UK\u2019s main patriotic party of working people.</p> <p>At a later hustings for Ukip members in Westminster, both he and Evans made rallying calls for the immediate revocation of the European Communities Act, saying it was necessary to hold Theresa May to account on delivering a real Brexit.</p> <p>\u201cWe want our borders back and we want our fish back as well,\u201d Evans said.</p> <p>Peter Whittle said he thought the country was \u201cunder a sort of attack\u201d and it was imperative to uphold British values by challenging sharia law and eradicating female genital mutilation.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole advance of radical Islam ... Who is the party that has time and time again stood up and said what people really believe about this?\u201d he added.</p> <p>Nuttall struck a similar tone, calling for sharia law to be outlawed from UK towns and cities and a ban on Saudi Arabian funding for mosques.</p> <p>On immigration, Evans said she supported the return of the primary purpose rule abolished by Labour requiring Brits with foreign spouses to prove that citizenship was not the main point of their marriage. She also called for immigrants to be able to support themselves and their families for five years and have a job before they enter the country.</p> <p>She said there was a need for Britishness to be emphasised in schools, claiming that Shakespeare is taught as a \u201cglobal playwright\u201d who comes from nowhere in particular.</p>",
  "<p>Even at the best of times, the mood of a typical evening fixture on the all-weather stops some way short of celebratory and Tuesday night\u2019s racing here was hardly the best of times, one day after a shocking four-horse pile-up that put three jockeys in hospital. Freddy Tylicki, who remains in intensive care with suspected spinal injuries of unknown gravity, was in the thoughts of those riders who returned here to keep racing\u2019s show on the road, comforting themselves with the fact that falls in Flat racing are rare.</p> <p>\u201cHopefully Freddy will be OK,\u201d said Pat Cosgrave, who had been on Tylicki\u2019s outside when the incident occurred on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a sobering experience. We\u2019re competitors on the track but we live together most of the day. When things like that happen, it\u2019s not about racing and it\u2019s not about money and it\u2019s not about horses winning or losing. It\u2019s about a bit of respect and hopefully the boys will be OK.\u201d</p> <p>Mercifully, it emerged that the other three riders involved in the pile-up had escaped without serious injury, including the new champion jockey of British Flat racing, Jim Crowley. He was treated on the track for more than an hour, yards from Tylicki, before being taken to hospital but was sent home on Monday night with no more than a broken nose.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/31/jockeys-crowley-tylicki-hospital-kempton-collision-racing\">Freddy Tylicki in intensive care and Jim Crowley on mend after Kempton pile-up</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Steve Drowne, whose mount was also brought down, was uninjured. Ted Durcan, unseated in the melee, broke an ankle but, being as robust as any jockey, arranged to be driven to a hospital at Cambridge, near his home, before seeking&#xa0;treatment.</p> <p>The Injured Jockeys Fund, which is providing updates on Tylicki, said the 30-year-old was conscious and stable at St George\u2019s Hospital in Tooting. He was undergoing assessment and further news about his condition is expected on Wednesday.</p> <p>While an entire sport crossed its fingers for him, the workaday business of eight more races went ahead. John Egan, who was among the winners, expressed the robust philosophy of a veteran rider: \u201cYou know what, when something happens, it\u2019s like when someone dies: you say, \u2018Isn\u2019t it terrible! We should appreciate things...\u2019 Then you go out the door and you forget about that. Life goes on. And, sure, if it didn\u2019t, the whole world would be stopped a long, long time ago.</p> <p>\u201cI had a bad fall in Wolverhampton about seven years ago and they told me afterwards that I was actually clinically gone for, like, a minute. Listen, these tracks are real safe, I swear to God, but look, accidents happen. You could slip down the stairs and break your neck. What are you going to do, take the stairs out? It\u2019s one of them things, there was nobody to blame.\u201d</p> <p>Barney Clifford, a jump jockey in years gone by who now works as Kempton\u2019s racing director, was full of praise for the medical team who had attended Tylicki and Crowley, especially their \u201cmeticulous, brilliant\u201d leader, Dr Peter Johnson. \u201cWhat\u2019s so sharp now, which is the most important thing, is the response time,\u201d Clifford said. He spoke also of how his groundstaff \u201crose to the occasion\u201d in assisting the paramedics and said it was eight years since the last comparable incident at the venue.</p> <p>In the background was a concern among some that this incident had highlighted the particular risks of all-weather racing, with packed fields racing around tight ovals. \u201cIf you look at any all-weather racing, a good position is key,\u201d the trainer Michael Attwater said. \u201cEveryone wants to be on the inside on the bends, so everyone tightens up. It\u2019s so easy to make a mistake. A clip of the heels and it\u2019s a knock-on effect.\u201d</p> <p>However, Attwater accepts there is no obvious scope for improving safety. \u201cYou\u2019re dealing with half a tonne of animal, 10 or 12 of them in a race and an eight\u2011stone jockey trying to guide them at 40mph. It\u2019s very hard to prevent anything ... unless every race is confined to four runners and even then it\u2019ll happen.

  "<p>Rights campaigners are among those sounding the alarm over the erosion of press freedom in Canada after it emerged that police in Montreal had spent several months monitoring the phone of a journalist in order to identify his sources.<br></p> <p>La Presse, one of Canada\u2019s oldest and largest newspapers, said on Monday that at least 24 surveillance warrants were obtained by Montreal police to track the phone of columnist Patrick Lagac\u00e9. The warrants enabled the force\u2019s special investigation unit to track Lagac\u00e9\u2019s whereabouts using the GPS in his phone, as well as monitor incoming and outgoing text messages and calls.</p> <p>The revelations left Lagac\u00e9 shaken. \u201cI was appalled,\u201d he said. \u201cI was living in the fiction that police officers wouldn\u2019t dare do that, and in the fiction that judges were protecting journalists \u2013 and hence the public \u2013 against this type of police intrusion.\u201d<br> </p> <p>Montreal police defended their actions, pointing to what they called an exceptional situation. The surveillance was part of an investigation into allegations that police officers in the drugs and street gangs unit had fabricated evidence and which saw five officers arrested this summer.</p> <p>Lagac\u00e9 became intertwined in the investigation after police detected contact between him and one of the officers under investigation. Police actions were aimed at investigating police officers, not Lagac\u00e9, police chief Philippe Pichet said on Monday.</p> <p>\u201cWe are very aware of the importance of freedom of the press,\u201d said Pichet. \u201cBut on the other hand, there were criminal allegations against a police officer \u2026 and we have a job to do.\u201d</p> <p>The force did not break any laws in pursuing the warrants, he noted. \u201cWe respected every law to obtain the warrant we got. We followed the rules, and the judge authorised the warrant.\u201d</p> <p>To his knowledge, no other journalists had been placed under surveillance but he said he could not guarantee that.</p> <p>Lagac\u00e9 dismissed the police chief\u2019s explanation. \u201cThe funny fact is that their suspicions involved stories I did not work on,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a real witch-hunt going on at the Montreal police department. It has been going on for years, they have been trying to find out who dare speaks to reporters.\u201d</p> <p>Denis Coderre, the mayor of Montreal, called the matter \u201ctroubling\u201d but refused calls by the opposition to force the police chief to step aside. The province\u2019s public security minister, Martin Coiteux, also weighed in, telling reporters that he found the news \u201cvery worrisome\u201d and said his department was examining whether police followed the proper procedures. Little more could be done, he said, warning it was not the place of government to interfere with a police investigation or judicial decisions.</p> <p>The revelations sparked condemnation from groups across the country.

  "<p>The decision by the director of public prosecutions not to charge a former MI6 official for the 2004 abduction and rendition of a Libyan dissident, Abdel Hakim Belhaj, is to be challenged in court.</p> <p>Lawyers for the human rights organisation Reprieve, which represents Belhaj and his family, have lodged a judicial review claim with the high court in London alleging that Alison Saunders \u201cerred in law\u201d in declining to prosecute Sir Mark Allen, who was previously head of counter-terrorism at MI6. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The 23-page claim and its appendix of secret documents \u2013 which record joint CIA-MI6 plans to extract Belhaj from Malaysia and forcibly remove him to the torture cells of Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s regime \u2013 are the latest twist in a protracted legal saga.</p> <p>Reprieve alleges that Allen \u201cdid not obtain any proper or adequate political approval\u201d for the rendition, which was arranged with the then Libyan intelligence chief, Moussa Koussa.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The judicial review challenge was drafted by barristers Clare Montgomery QC, Ben Jaffey and Helen Law. It argues that Saunders misdirected herself about whether rendition amounts to misconduct in public office. It is a \u201cconduct crime\u201d and not a \u201cresults crime\u201d, the submission states. \u201cThe crime is constituted by the misconduct itself rather than the results that follow from it.\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p> The submission also claims that Allen\u2019s \u201cadmitted failure to properly disclose conduct and involvement to superiors and ministers may itself amount to misconduct in the context of a \u2018rendition\u2019 operation, even if the public officer was unaware of the operation before it took place\u201d.</p> <p>A lengthy police investigation into the rendition, codenamed Operation Lydd, was carried out by Metropolitan detectives.</p> <p>Last month the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, seemed to suggest the police had recommended that Allen should be charged. Answering questions in the London assembly about the inquiry, he said: \u201cThe Metropolitan police submitted a comprehensive file of evidence (in excess of 28,000 pages) to the Crown Prosecution Service seeking to demonstrate that the conduct of a British official amounted to misconduct in public office.\u201d</p> <p>Cori Crider, who is Belhaj\u2019s lawyer, said: \u201cProsecutors should never bend over backwards to protect the powerful. But that is precisely what happened here. The CPS was so keen to excuse Sir Mark\u2019s actions that they invented creative excuses for his conduct that aren\u2019t a legal defence to the crimes he was accused of. </p> <p>\u201cThey have treated Sir Mark\u2019s victims appallingly, calling the family\u2019s views \u2018irrelevant\u2019 and refusing to address a single page of the reams of evidence [given] to police. They\u2019ve even threatened to pursue the family for legal costs when the family have offered to drop all cases for just an official apology and pocket change.

Giving evidence to a committee this morning, he said there probably won\u2019t be a war with Russia next year.</p> <p>The Press Association has the story.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Fears that Russia and Nato are on a collision course for war next year have been dismissed by defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon. </p> <p>Fallon insisted that a hot conflict with Moscow was not likely in 2017, as he gave evidence to the Commons defence committee. </p> <p>Pressed about warnings by former Nato deputy allied commander in Europe, General Sir Richard Shirreff, that the plot of his novel 2017 War With Russia was plausible, Fallon said that was an extreme view. </p> <p>\u201cWell, there are a lot of people writing books and trying to sell them, and his is a very good one. However, I don\u2019t agree that war with Russia is likely next year. I think that is too extreme. </p> <p>\u201cWe have seen much greater Russian aggression this year, and in previous years, in terms of long-range aviation, in terms of submarine activity, and the carrier task group that sailed through our waters, the role of Russia in Syria, and elsewhere. But I don\u2019t think that presages an open conflict next year. </p> <p>\u201cAnd I hope that General Shirreff would - and I think he does this - recognise that Nato is now responding. So, Nato is waking up to the challenge,\u201d Fallon said. </p> <p>The defence secretary insisted the decision to send 800 British troops to Estonia next year was intended to create an \u201cearlier tripwire\u201d and act as a deterrent against possible aggression. </p> <p>\u201cThe whole point of forward deployment to Estonia is to arrange, if you like, an earlier tripwire so the force there doesn\u2019t have to wait for tension to escalate. The force will be there from next spring in any event, in all three of the Baltic states. It\u2019s partly reassurance, but it\u2019s also deterrence - to make it very clear to any potential aggressor that Nato is ready to respond.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>Astute readers will, of course, realise that the very fact that a \u2018no war next year\u2019 declaration has become newsworthy is itself a matter of some concern.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b4273636bc65af1108d84b33c6959042a585d1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b4273636bc65af1108d84b33c6959042a585d1e/0_4_1773_1064/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Michael Fallon arriving for cabinet at Number 10 this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Michael Fallon arriving for cabinet at Number 10 this morning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5818ab91e4b01c528432f015\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T14:50:18.136Z\">2.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is <strong>Ed Miliband</strong>, the former Labour leader, on Karen Bradley\u2019s statement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Ed_Miliband/status/793464579250647040\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">DC, NC and I signed pledge to support Section 40 on costs.

Both involve unwinding significant elements of Leveson, the inquiry set up with cross-party support in the Commons after the phone-hacking scandal, and in truth neither is particularly surprising, although there is one line in the small print that is intriguing.</p> <p><strong>1 - Bradley has confirmed that the government may shelve part two of the Leveson inquiry, the bit that was intended to examine in detail allegations of phone hacking and collusion with the police at News International and other newspaper organisations. </strong>Although part one of the inquiry covered phone hacking, it did not consider allegations in details because at that stage prosecutions were pending. When David Cameron launched the inquiry, he specifically said that a second stage would investigate what happened in detail once the police investigations were over.<br></p> <p>All the key prosecutions have now concluded. Bradley has now launched a consultation on whether to press ahead with part two of the inquiry although the chances of part two actually proceeding are probably no higher than nil. When David Cameron was prime minister it was widely reported that part two would be permanently shelved. Theresa May may seem less interested in schmoozing the media than Cameron, but she is not daft and it is very hard to see why she would want to launch an inquiry that would trigger all-out war with powerful, Conservative-supporting newspaper groups, especially News UK, the successor to News International.</p> <p><strong>2 - Bradley has announced that she will consult on whether or not to implement section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013.</strong> This is also unsurprising. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/01/guardianicm-poll-gives-tories-16-point-lead-over-labour-politics-live?page=with:block-58188023e4b01c528432ef0f#block-58188023e4b01c528432ef0f\">12.59am.)</a> But what\u2019s interesting is that Bradley is consulting on four options: keeping section 40 under review, bringing it in, repealing it, or partially introducing it. It was never likely that Bradley would introduce it, and her comments in the chamber (see, for example, what she said about Peter Preston\u2019s column at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/01/guardianicm-poll-gives-tories-16-point-lead-over-labour-politics-live?page=with:block-58189d5ae4b01c528432efc2#block-58189d5ae4b01c528432efc2\">1.50pm)</a> suggest implementation is not a runner. But she has also included the option of partially introducing part 40 - introducing the \u201ccarrot\u201d (exemption from costs for papers that lose a court case, if they are signed up to a Leveson-compliant regulator) but shelving the \u201cstick\u201d (forcing papers to pay their opponents\u2019 costs even if they win, if they are not signed up to a Leveson-compliant regulator). This would benefit the small number of organised that belong to IMPRESS. Papers signed up to IPSO would probably complain if Bradley were to choose this option (and there is no particular reason to think she will) but doing this would allow her to claim she is salvaging one more vestige of Leveson.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T08:27:24.739Z\">at 8.27am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5818a1f4e4b01c528432efdc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T14:09:15.796Z\">2.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bradley\u2019s statement is now over.

It is expected that she will use the statement to unpick one of the consequences of the Leveson report into phone hacking.</p> <p>The Leveson report was published in November 2012 and it recommended a tighter form of press regulation. The newspaper industry accepted the need for some reform, but it strongly opposed anything smacking of state regulation and, after much haggling, a compromise system was adopted. A royal charter was granted in 2013 and that led to the establishment of a Press Recognition Panel (PRP) which has the job of approving Leveson-compliant press regulators. Most national newspaper groups decided not to cooperate with this system and support the Independent Press Standards Organisation, an independent regulator. But a few publications signed up to IMPRESS, an alternative regulator, and last week IMPRESS became the first regulator to get PRP approval.</p> <p>This is significant because, one a PRP-approved regulator is in place, section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 is supposed to come into force. This section, passed with cross-party support, is designed to provide \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d incentives to newspapers to sign up to a PRP-approved regulator. The carrot is that papers that belong to such a regulator won\u2019t have to pay the costs of claimants if they get sued for libel, even if the paper loses. The stick applies to papers that don\u2019t belong to such a regulator; under section 40, they will have to pay the costs of people who sue them, even if the paper wins.</p> <p>But section 40 only comes into force if the government activates it. As you can imagine, the prospect of this happening has alarmed the newspaper industry. Bradley has already said that she will take her time before deciding what to do, and in a few minutes we will learn more.</p> <p>Section 40 is not the only stick in the Crime and Courts Act 20113. Section 34, which is already in force, allows the courts to impose exemplary damages (ie, extra, punitive damages, on top of normal libel damages) against newspapers that have not joined a PRP-approved regulator. But exemplary damages are relatively unusual, and so far this section has not caused any problems for newspapers outside the Leveson framework.</p> <p>There is more on this topic<a href=\"http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7576/CBP-7576.pdf\"> in this House of Commons library briefing paper (pdf).</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0520dd0d693620dfb607977c470352249fd20e19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0520dd0d693620dfb607977c470352249fd20e19/0_149_5242_3144/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Karen Bradley, the culture secretary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karen Bradley, the culture secretary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58189107e4b01c528432ef7c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T12:58:27.284Z\">12.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Labour\u2019s <strong>Dennis Skinner </strong>asks why, if more than 30 years is too long to make an inquiry worthwhile, why it is not long enough to justify the release of some cabinet papers about the strike.

Here are the figures.</p> <p>Conservatives: 43% (no change from mid October)</p> <p>Labour: 27% (up 1)</p> <p>Ukip: 12% (up 1)</p> <p>Lib Dems: 8% (no change)</p> <p>Greens: 5% (down 1)</p> <p>The fieldwork was carried out between Friday and Sunday last week. ICM Unlimited interviewed a representative online sample of 2,040 adults and the data has been weighted to the profile of all adults.</p> <p>So, nothing much has changed (although Ukip may be heartened to discovered that their leadership turmoil does not seem to be doing them much harm). And Labour continues to flounder. If you want to know why Theresa May and her ministers do not seem to be remotely worried about anything the opposition are doing or saying, the answer is in these figures.</p> <p>If there is any reaction to this poll, I will post it.</p> <p>Otherwise, here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9am: </em>The cabinet meets.<br></p> <p><em>10am:</em> The Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign holds a press conference in Barnsley.</p> <p><em>11.30am: </em>Sir Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, gives evidence to the Commons defence committee.</p> <p><em>12pm:</em> Philip Hammond, the chancellor, gives a speech on the government\u2019s nationaly cyber security strategy.

  "<p>A judge has rejected the settlement of a lawsuit triggered by the New York City police department\u2019s surveillance of Muslims, on the grounds that the terms did not go far enough.</p> <p>The settlement ruled upon was a January resolution of two cases, which stem from 2011 revelations that the NYPD was conducting widespread surveillance of Muslims that plaintiffs argued had violated their rights.</p> <p>January\u2019s settlement resulted in Mayor Bill De Blasio agreeing to appoint a civilian monitor of the NYPD\u2019s counter-terrorism units, pending approval by a judge.</p> <p>The presiding judge in the case, Charles S Haight Jr, agreed with the overall structure of the settlement but found that the powers of the civilian representative agreed upon in the settlement did not go far enough.</p> <p>\u201cThe proposed role and powers of the civilian representative do not furnish sufficient protection from potential violations of the constitutional rights of those law-abiding Muslims and believers in Islam who live, move and have their being in this city,\u201d Haight wrote in his ruling.</p> <p>This means that a new settlement will have to be negotiated by the parties involved or take the matter to court.</p> <p>Haight\u2019s main contention in the negotiated settlement was the power and appointment of the civilian representative. The settlement stipulates the representative should report violations to the police commissioner, who is only obligated to investigate the incident, but Haight argued the representative should rather file quarterly reports to the court.</p> <p>He also rejected provisions that the mayor should appoint the civilian representative and have the power to eliminate the position after five years.</p> <p>The lawsuits arose following 2011 <a href=\"http://www.ap.org/Index/AP-In-The-News/NYPD\">revelations</a> that the NYPD, with help from the CIA, was using undercover informants to spy on Muslims throughout New York and New Jersey in mosques, religious bookstores, hookah bars and other places.</p> <p>In his ruling, Haight also cited a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/nypd-muslims-surveillance-violations\">recent report</a> by the NYPD\u2019s inspector general, an oversight body. The report examined the compliance by the department\u2019s intelligence unit of the Handschu guidelines \u2013 a set of provisions designed to ensure the NYPD does not overreach when investigating political or religious groups. The report found the department has consistently violated several regulations by continuing investigations and using informants for extended periods without authorization. The report also highlighted in a footnote that 95% of investigations were launched against Muslims.</p> <p>According to some watchdog groups and the OIG report, NYPD\u2019s targeting of Muslims has continued despite the disbanding of the demographics unit, which was created in the wake of 9/11 and focused on monitoring Muslim communities.</p> <p>The judge said the report described a near systematic failure on the NYPD\u2019s to comply with these particular guidelines. NYPD officials <a href=\"http://nypdnews.com/2016/08/inspector-generals-audit-commends-nypds-efforts-to-protect-new-york-city-from-terrorism/\">characterized</a> the report findings as vindication that they were complying with guidelines.</p> <p>Haight was also the judge who ruled in favor of expanding the NYPD\u2019s powers to allow it to act with less oversight post-9/11.</p> <p>The plaintiffs in the cases are represented by several civil liberties groups, including the ACLU and the New York Civil Liberties Union, all of which received Haight\u2019s ruling positively.</p> <p>\u201cThe ruling is an opportunity to put stronger safeguards in place and we very much look forward to discussing the court\u2019s suggestions with the NYPD and with the city,\u201d said Ramzi Kassem, a law professor at CUNY School of Law, where he directs the Clear project. \u201cBecause we believe that this is in the interest of all New Yorkers, we hope that the reforms are implemented as soon as possible.\u201d<br></p> <p>The city law spokesman Nick Paolucci said they were disappointed the settlement was not approved.</p> <p>\u201cTo the extent that the Court\u2019s decision is based in part on an Inspector General\u2019s report containing findings with which both the City and Class Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel variously disagree, we are disappointed that the settlement was not approved as the parties originally proposed,\u201d Paolucci said in a statement. \u201cThat said, we will explore ways to address the concerns raised by the Judge.\u201d</p> <p>Fahd Ahmed, executive director of Desis Rising Up &amp; Moving, whose group has documented the ongoing surveillance by NYPD, said that even with the judge\u2019s suggestions, the settlement does not go far enough as it largely depends on good faith from the police department which they have not earned. </p> <p>\u201cAs the judge points out, and the inspector general report confirms, the NYPD has a long history of ignoring rules and disregarding court orders and their own procedures,\u201d Ahmed said.</p>",

  "<p>The chief executive of EDF Energy has vowed that the \u00a324bn Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant will be built by 2025 and will not result in extra costs to UK taxpayers.</p> <p>In evidence before the House of Lords economic affairs select committee, Vincent de Rivaz dismissed parallels with two nuclear <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/27/flamanville-france-edf-nuclear-reactor-hinkley-point-c\">plants EDF is building</a> in France and Finland, which have suffered delays and cost overruns.</p> <p>He said planning of the two projects had been \u201cflawed\u201d and there had been \u201cunderestimation\u201d of their costs but insisted EDF had learned lessons from these setbacks. \u201cThe assumptions made on cost and schedule were wrong, dead wrong. We have dramatically changed the approach by which we prepared this project,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Asked if taxpayers would have to pay for any unforeseen cost increases, or a decision to abandon the 3.2-gigawatt plant altogether, De Rivaz said: \u201cCategorically not\u201d.</p> <p>The promises come just days after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/30/hinkley-point-nuclear-waste-storage-costs\">secret government papers revealed</a> that taxpayers would foot the bill if the cost of storing nuclear waste from the plant, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-chinese-firm-to-submit-essex-nuclear-plant-plans\">EDF is building in partnership with China General Nuclear</a>, spiralled out of control.</p> <p>Hinkley Point C, which won <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/29/hinkley-point-ministers-sign-go-ahead-for-nuclear-power-plant\">final approval</a> in September after Theresa May ordered a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-to-go-ahead-after-edf-board-approves-project\">last-minute review</a>, has also faced criticism over the \u00a392.50 per megawatt hour (MW/h) \u201cstrike price\u201d that the government guaranteed to pay EDF for electricity.</p> <p>Members of the committee pointed to a presentation by EDF in 2008 that predicted Hinkley could deliver power at just \u00a345/MWh, citing the forecast as evidence that costs could increase further.</p> <p>De Rivaz said the figure had never been submitted to government but admitted it had been a mistake. \u201cAt that time there were flawed assumptions based on the cost of [the French reactor at] Flamanville,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat interests us today is the cost of Hinkley Point C. It\u2019s a battle of the past.\u201d</p> <p>He said the eventual agreement was a \u201cfair, fair deal\u201d for UK consumers.</p> <p>While Hinkley Point C has proved controversial in the UK, it has also led to deep divisions in EDF Energy\u2019s parent company, EDF, majority owned by the French state.</p> <p>French trade unions have opposed the firm\u2019s role in the plant, while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/07/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-project-in-crisis-as-edf-finance-director-resigns\">former finance chief Thomas Piquemal</a> was among <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/resignation-edf-director-hinkley-point-gerard-magnin\">executives who quit EDF</a> over concerns about the risks to the company\u2019s finances.</p> <p>\u201cIt is his choice to talk down about the company he has just left,\u201d said De Rivaz, adding that Piquemal\u2019s replacement, Xavier Girre, had \u201cno reservations at all\u201d.</p> <p>He added that the project, due to provide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-guide-uk-first-new-nuclear-plant-for-20-years\">7% of the UK\u2019s power needs</a>, would be ready on time. \u201cIn 2025, when the country needs it, it will be up and running.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The number of mental health nurses working in the NHS has dropped by almost a sixth since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, figures show.</p> <p>The revelation has sparked fresh doubt that government pledges to improve mental health services are being matched by progress at the NHS frontline. </p> <p>Philip Dunne, the health minister, has admitted in a written parliamentary answer that while there were 45,384 mental health nurses working in England in 2010, there were just 38,774 in July this year. That fall of 6,610 nurses represents the loss of about 1,000 such specialists a year, or almost 15% of the entire workforce providing that sort of vital care to patients over the last six and a half years. </p> <p>\u201cThis is a very worrying downward trend that shows no sign of turning around, despite all the government\u2019s pronouncements and pledges about equality for mental health care compared to physical health care,\u201d said Labour MP Luciana Berger, the ex-shadow health minister who obtained the answer. </p> <p>The loss of so many posts meant that patients are at risk of receiving lesser-quality care than before and their recovery is being jeopardised by having less contact time with nurses, who were likely to be busier than ever, Berger warned. </p> <p>The Royal College of Nursing claimed the figures proved that patients were being let down and ministerial pledges of recent years were not being delivered. </p> <p>\u201cThese numbers make it very clear why so many mental health patients are simply not getting the care they need,\u201d said Janet Davies, the RCN\u2019s chief executive and general secretary. \u201cThe government has committed to equal treatment of mental and physical illness, but these figures show how far the health system still is from achieving that. Without the right number of nurses, people cannot get the care and treatment they need.\u201d</p> <p>The ongoing reduction in nurse numbers is also counterproductive because it leads to greater pressure on other public services, Davies added. \u201cEarly intervention is the most effective way to tackle mental health problems, but at the moment patients often aren\u2019t being treated until they reach breaking point and problems are escalating out of control. The pressures on mental health services are spilling out into social care, A&amp;E and even police custody.\u201d</p> <p>Mental health hospitals have seen the biggest fall in nursing staff. A total of 24,581 nurses worked in such settings in 2010 but by July that had dropped to 19,170 \u2013 a loss of 5,411 posts (22%).</p> <p>The number of specialist nurses working with patients with learning disabilities had also fallen by 538 from 2,508 to 1,970, while those in \u201cother learning disabilities\u201d has fallen 44% from 2,628 to 1,483. </p> <p>The sharp decline shows the coalition government\u2019s pledge in 2014 to bring about \u201cparity of esteem\u201d in NHS treatment of patients with mental and physical health conditions will not be honoured any time soon, Berger added. Urgent action was needed to stem the dwindling numbers before patient care deteriorated further and remaining staff had to cope with even bigger caseloads, she said. </p> <p>NHS trusts are allowing the number of mental health nurses to shrink because they do not have enough money to employ as many as they need to provide proper care, Berger claimed. Recent freedom of information requests the Liverpool Wavertree MP undertook found that 57% of GP-led clinical commissioning groups, which hold NHS budgets locally in England, planned to cut their spending on mental health this year, despite ministerial pledges that CCGs should increase spending on such services by the same amount as their overall budget rises. </p> <p>The only area of mental health care to have more nurses working in it than in 2010 is community psychiatry. Some 16,152 such nurses work there now, compared to 15,666 in 2010. </p> <p>The overall fall in mental health nurses in recent years is even larger \u2013 7,381 rather than 6,610 \u2013 if 2009-10, Labour\u2019s last year in power, rather than 2010 is used as the starting point. </p> <p>The Department of Health said the figures did not give the full picture of the mental health workforce and that the number of both junior doctors and consultants working in psychiatry has been going up. </p> <p> \u201cSince 2012, the number of trainee doctors working in mental health settings during their foundation programme has more than doubled, we have seen the highest-ever fill rate for core psychiatry training, and mental health nursing trainee places are growing at a faster rate than any other nursing specialty in the NHS.</p> <p>\u201cThis government is determined to address for the first time some of the very deep inequalities that people with mental ill health face, and while we have more to do, progress is being made,\u201d a spokesman said. </p>",

  "<p>A Russian dissident jailed under a controversial new Kremlin law says he is being beaten, repeatedly tortured and threatened with murder at the penal colony where he is being held in north-west Russia.<br></p> <p>Ildar Dadin says he is the victim of systematic abuse perpetrated by the head of the prison, Maj Sergey Kossiev, and his staff. He alleges that Kossiev has told him that if he complains about his treatment he will be killed and secretly buried.</p> <p>A Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on Tuesday that President Vladimir Putin would be informed of the allegations, while Russian media reported that the regional branch of Russia\u2019s investigative committee would look into Dadin\u2019s claims.</p> <p>In response to the letter, Amnesty International has called for Dadin\u2019s release. \u201cWe are urging Russian authorities to end the pattern of impunity for torture and other ill treatment and investigate Ildar Dadin\u2019s appalling allegations,\u201d Sergei Nikitin, the director of Amnesty International Russia, said. \u201cThey must also immediately and unconditionally release Ildar Dadin, and provide him with full remedy for the injustice done to him.\u201d</p> <p>Dadin, 34, was jailed in 2015 after staging a series of anti-government protests. He was convicted<a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/12/russia-peaceful-activist-sentenced-under-repressive-new-law-must-be-released/\"> under a new law which criminalises public assembly</a>, and given a three-year sentence, which was later cut to two and a half.</p> <p>In the letter to his wife, Anastasia, <a href=\"https://meduza.io/feature/2016/11/01/izbivali-po-10-12-chelovek-odnovremenno-nogami\">smuggled out of prison by his lawyer</a>, he described having all of his belongings confiscated, and claims two razor blades were planted on him as an excuse to send him to solitary confinement by way of \u201cpunishment\u201d.</p> <p>The following day he says Kossiev arrived with three prison warders and began to beat him. \u201cOver the course of that day, I was beaten a total four times, by 10-12 people at once. They would kick me,\u201d he writes. \u201cAfter the third beating, they lowered my head into a toilet right there in the holding cell.\u201d</p> <p>He goes on to describe being cuffed and hung from the ceiling. \u201cBeing suspended in this manner brought about terrible pain in the wrists, twisted out my elbows, and caused horrible back pain. I was suspended like that for half an hour.</p> <p>\u201cThen they took off my underwear and said they would bring another prisoner to rape me unless I stopped my hunger strike.\u201d</p> <p>The prison boss later allegedly told Dadin that if he complained his beatings could be made worse, and he could be killed and buried \u201cunder the fence\u201d. </p> <p>Dadin also claims he is being beaten \u201cseveral times a day\u201d as well as bullied and routinely humiliated. \u201cThis is happening with the other prisoners, as well,\u201d he writes.</p> <p>Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the oligarch who spent 10 years in jail in Russia before being amnestied in 2013, told the Guardian he was familiar with these conditions. Khodorkovsky said he was locked up in the same penal colony in Karelia after being convicted for a second time. </p> <p>\u201cIldar Dadin has finished up in the same prison camp, simply for protesting peacefully and for expressing his personal views.

If you decide to publish this information about what is happening to me, then try to distribute it as widely as possible. This will increase my chances of staying alive. </p> <p>Know that there is an entire mafia operating at penal colony 7. It involves the entire administration, among them the colony\u2019s head Major Sergey Leonidovich Kossiev and the vast majority of its employees, including the doctors.</p> <p>Upon my arrival at the colony on 10 September, I had practically all of my things taken away from me. Two razor blades were then planted [amongst my remaining possessions] and subsequently \u201cdiscovered\u201d during an inspection. This is a common practice here \u2013 it gives them grounds to throw all newcomers into solitary confinement, to ensure they immediately understand the hell that they found themselves in. </p> <p>I was put into solitary without any official orders. All of my things were taken away, including soap, my toothbrush, toothpaste, and even toilet paper. In protest of these illegal activities, I went on a hunger strike.</p> <p>On 11 September, the colony head Kossiev came to me with three employees. Together, they started beating me. Over the course of that day, I was beaten a total four times, by 10-12 people at once. They would kick me. After the third beating, they lowered my head into a toilet right there in the holding cell.</p> <p>On 12 September, [several] employees cuffed my hands behind my back and hung me up. Being suspended in this manner brought about terrible pain in the wrists, twisted out my elbows, and caused horrible back pain. I was suspended like that for half an hour.

If I give the order, you will be beaten much worse. If you try to complain, they will kill you and bury you under the fence.\u201d After that, they beat me regularly, several times a day. Regular beatings, bullying, humiliation, insults, intolerable detention conditions \u2013 this is happening with the other prisoners, as well.</p> <p>All subsequent punishments were based on blatant lies. All of the videos in which I was [filmed] being \u201cpenalised\u201d were staged: before filming, they would tell me how to behave and what to do \u2013 not to argue, not to protest, to look at the floor. </p> <p>Otherwise, they said, they would kill [me] and no one would know about it, because no one knows where I am. I cannot send letters without going through the administration first, and the administration has promised to kill me if I write any complaints. </p> <p>Nastya, I ask you to publish this letter because there is a real \u201cinformation blockade\u201d in this place and I see no other opportunities to break through it. I am not asking you to get me out of here or to have me transferred to another facility.

  "<p>The culture secretary has dramatically reopened the issue of press regulation by questioning whether the second part of the Leveson inquiry, meant to investigate corrupt dealings between the press and police, was still in the public interest.</p> <p>Karen Bradley confirmed a Guardian report that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/01/government-to-launch-new-press-regulation-consultation\">the government is to launch a consultation</a> on two remaining issues: costs provisions for victims of phone hacking and Leveson \u201cpart two\u201d into police wrongdoing. The latter had been delayed by continuing criminal actions resulting from the phone-hacking scandal at News International, which prompted the Leveson inquiry in 2011.</p> <p>Speaking in parliament, Bradley said the extent of those criminal investigations, and the implementation of recommendations in part one of the report, as well as the costs for both of nearly \u00a350m, meant the government was reconsidering whether to undertake part two.</p> <p>In a statement, the government said that the consultation would consider whether part two was \u201cstill appropriate, proportionate and in the public interest, and if so what it should cover and in what form\u201d.</p> <p>Accused by campaigners for press victims and some Labour MPs of pandering to newspaper press barons and ignoring their victims, Bradley said further consultation was the only way to ensure a balance was struck between the two sides.</p> <p>\u201cThose who are treated improperly must have redress,\u201d she said. \u201cLikewise, politicians must not seek to muffle the press or prevent it doing legitimate work, such as holding us to account. And the police must take seriously its role in protecting not only its own reputation, but also those people it is meant to serve.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the balance that we wish to strike, and this consultation is the most appropriate and fairest way of doing so.\u201d</p> <p>In response, Tom Watson, the shadow culture secretary and deputy Labour leader, said it was a \u201csad day\u201d, coming almost three years after cross-party agreement was reached on the Leveson recommendations.</p> <p>\u201cIn effect, she is today announcing whether a cover-up should be covered up. Events in the last five years make Leveson part two more urgent, not less.\u201d</p> <p>Evan Harris, joint executive director of Hacked Off, which represents victims of press intrusion, accused the government of \u201ccaving in to Rupert Murdoch and his fellow proprietors\u201d by launching an \u201cunnecessary consultation\u201d. </p> <p>The postponement and potential cancellation of part two of the inquiry was \u201can outrageous betrayal of promises made to victims of press abuse and to the British people by the former prime ministers\u201d, he said.</p> <p>\u201cThis consultation will not change the fact that the government gives every impression of being in hock to powerful press interests and ignoring not just the victims of press abuse, but the fact that promises were made under oath at a public inquiry and to parliament.\u201d</p> <p>Bradley was asked in the House whether Theresa May had discussed the process at her private meeting with Murdoch last month. Watson also asked if Lord Justice Leveson had been consulted about the latest inquiry, and whether Bradley had talked to the victims of phone hacking, such as the parents of Milly Dowler. <br></p> <p>Bradley said the first people she had met since starting as culture secretary this summer had been such victims.</p> <p>The second remaining issue to be subject to the inquiry, often referred to as \u201ccosts provisions\u201d, involves the implementation of section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013, which though enacted by parliament, needs to be commenced by the culture secretary.</p> <p>These provisions, bitterly opposed by the newspaper industry, would make members of a recognised self-regulator exempt from paying their opponents\u2019 legal costs. </p> <p>Impress is the only regulator to receive such recognition but it has just 50 small media groups as members, while Ipso, the press regulator with more than 2,500 members backed by most big newspaper groups with the exception of the Guardian and the Financial Times, will not seek recognition, citing fears over political interference. </p> <p>If section 40 is commenced there is a presumption that newspapers outside a recognised self-regulator would pay their own and their opponents\u2019 legal costs, even if they won a court case. </p> <p>Bob Satchwell, executive director of the Society of Editors, welcomed the consultation exercise. \u201cOver the past decade the economic and competitive background has also changed dramatically. It would be dangerous to open up local and regional papers particularly with threats of legal action to costs of which they would have to pay even if they won a case, and which could put them out of business.</p> <p>\u201cA detailed look by government at the realities of regulation is the best way to ensure that individuals are properly protected without losing valuable watchdogs that expose corruption, wrongdoing and hypocrisy in the public interest.\u201d</p> <p>There have been persistent rumours that <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/medianews/article4642007.ece\">the government had decided to shelve the second part of Leveson</a>, fuelled in recent weeks by reports in <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/medianews/article4642007.ece\">the Times</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3360215/Stage-two-inquiry-Press-not-happen-no-political-appetite-hold-expensive-time-consuming-investigation.html\">Daily Mail</a>. Downing Street has repeatedly denied that any decision had yet been taken about whether to continue with the inquiry.</p> <p>Following the Bradley statement, a Lords amendment to the investigatory powers bill, which would have introduced section 40 for the victims of phone hacking was blocked by the government. The Commons rejected the Lords amendment by 298 to 261, a majority of 37, following a debate. It is thought likely that the Lords will try again to get the powers onto the statute book, however.</p> <p>The government\u2019s consultation will last 10 weeks, closing on 10 January. </p>",
  "<p>Prison officers have suspended plans to hold meetings outside jails across England and Wales on Wednesday in protest against the levels of violence behind bars.</p> <p>The justice secretary, Liz Truss, has agreed to meet the Prison Officers Association (POA) on Wednesday and to start urgent talks on health and safety inside prisons and serious problems in the recruitment and retention of staff.</p> <p>Truss gave a clear hint to MPs on Tuesday that she would announce fresh measures to boost prison staff when she publishes her major prison safety and reform white paper on Thursday.</p> <p>Michael Spurr, the chief executive of the National Offender Management Service, has agreed to authorise hour-long union branch meetings to take place inside every prison in England and Wales on Wednesday to discuss specific safety concerns that officers have.</p> <p>Spurr has written to the POA asking the organisation to withdraw its circular asking for meetings, telling them that prison governors will \u201cengage fully with legitimate concerns and take all reasonable action and appropriate action in response\u201d.</p> <p>The POA, which is banned by law from taking industrial action, had asked all its branches to hold emergency meetings outside every jail before the morning unlock on Wednesday. Under the plans they were to \u201cretreat to a place of safety\u201d if managers tried to enforce unsafe working practices when they went to work.</p> <p>The decision by the prison officers\u2019 union followed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/27/prison-violence-staff-cuts-moj-deaths-assaults\">publication of official statistics on violence in jails last Thursday</a>, which showed that assaults on officers and inmates have reached 65 a day amid record levels of prisoner suicides and self-harm. Staffing levels in prisons have been cut by 30% since 2010.</p> <p>Steve Gillan, general secretary of the POA, said the union had decided to suspend rather than withdraw its circular saying the levels of violence had reached completely unacceptable levels putting the safety of prison officers at risk. \u201cIf you do not have enough staff on the landings then problems such as prisoners not being able to get enough clean shorts or pillow cases will cause all sorts of strife,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In the Commons the justice secretary told MPs that last week\u2019s violence statistics showed \u201cthe very serious issues we have in our prisons, including a 43% rise in the number of attacks on officers. This is unacceptable, and I am determined to tackle it. I have already announced an investment of \u00a314m in 10 of our most challenging prisons, and I shall say more with the launch of our white paper shortly.\u201d</p> <p>Truss said there were a number of factors behind the unacceptable levels of violence, including the trade behind bars in new psychoactive substances, but she did acknowledge a clear link with staffing levels. \u201cI acknowledge that there is an issue with staffing, which is why I have already taken steps in 10 of the most challenging prisons to increase staffing levels, and why we are due to do more in the white paper,\u201d she said.</p>",

But a second, more substantial, response chased behind it in the form of a rather basic, and recurrent, question. Why is the UK establishment in general, and UK intelligence in particular, so fixated on a supposed threat from Russia?</p> <p>The cold war is a quarter-century behind us. The Warsaw Pact was dissolved; the Soviet Union collapsed. Today\u2019s Russia has three quarters of the territory but only half the population of the old Soviet Union. <a href=\"http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/gdp\" title=\"\">Its GDP</a>, whether overall or per capita, is far below that of the US, or ours. Its 2015 military budget took 5% of that \u2013 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_the_Russian_Federation\" title=\"\">$70bn in actual money</a> \u2013 less than an eighth of the nearly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_the_United_States\" title=\"\">$600bn spent by the US</a>. \u201cTsar\u201d Vladimir Putin may have played a weak hand magnificently, as judged by admirers and detractors alike, but a weak hand is still a weak hand.</p> <p>If Russia really harbours ambitions to reconstitute an empire, its only success to date is the expensive (in every respect) reacquisition of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/crimea\" title=\"\">Crimea</a>, a contested no-man\u2019s land of ragtag rebels in the rust belt of eastern <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\" title=\"\">Ukraine</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/14/georgia-accuses-russia-of-violating-international-law-over-south-ossetia\" title=\"\">two miniature enclaves</a> inside independent Georgia. That recent \u201cshow of force\u201d, when the might of the Russian navy made its stately progress through the English Channel, demonstrated only the obsolescence of the erstwhile superpower\u2019s fleet.</p> <p>In the same interview, Parker disclosed that there were around 3,000 \u201cviolent Islamic extremists in the UK, mostly British\u201d, and that cyber, not just in Russia\u2019s hands, was the threat of the future. So let me repeat the question: why does Russia remain bogeyman-in-chief?</p> <p>Here are a few ideas. The first is that blaming Russia carries little cost. Russia is not China. Investment is not a big consideration. For all sorts of reasons, political relations have long been dire. Applying the same virulent rhetoric to terrorism conducted in the name of Islam, on the other hand, risks fomenting social and cultural strife here at home.</p> <p>A second reason, now as in the past, is that blaming Russia aligns us comfortably with the US, where stalwarts in Congress and at the Pentagon have never emerged from their old thinking about the threat. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/trump-organization-server-russia-bank-slate-report\" title=\"\">Russia card</a> has been played to exhaustion during this presidential campaign, to the point where it could swing the election \u2013 and I don\u2019t mean in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\" title=\"\">Donald Trump</a>\u2019s favour.</p> <p>A third factor is the consensus about a strong and malevolent Russia that still rules the \u201cexpert\u201d community, and will probably do so for a few years yet \u2013 helped along by the hatchet-faced Putin. There are younger specialists who take a rather different view, but they are drowned out by the ingrained cliches. Note how quickly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson</a> was \u201cturned\u201d from the realist of his journalist days to the fierce cold warrior foreign secretary. Such a U-turn makes him look intellectually foolish \u2013 but no more foolish, some might argue, than he has made himself look on so many other scores.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/10/vladimir-putin-theresa-may-cooperation-litvinenko\">Theresa May should beware Putin: he doesn\u2019t do \u2018cooperation\u2019 | Luke Harding</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then again, all this anti-Russianism from MI5 could just be a front. Although it is hard to understand what purpose would be served by presenting Russians as scarier than jihadis or the gangsters who supposedly roam London in search of machine guns, disinformation is the stock in trade of intelligence services everywhere. Or \u2013 perish the thought \u2013 the judgments could just be wrong. There have, after all, been egregious mistakes, even where the material has been gathered and interpreted in good faith. Look no further than the data on Iraq\u2019s chemical weapons, as assessed by Parker\u2019s colleagues and institutional rivals across the Thames.</p> <p>I wonder, though, whether the real secret behind the MI5 chief\u2019s Russia focus is that it is starting to become harder to demonise Russia now. Time was when James Bond and the pantomime idea of a Russia threat were an easy sell \u2013 able to bolster departmental claims to a bigger budget. But look at the \u201cbelow the line\u201d comments on what Parker had to say and there is a current of dissent that cannot come exclusively from so-called Kremlin \u201ctrolls\u201d. You hear something similar in phone-ins on Russian topics, where the voice of a sceptical public comes across loud and strong.

  "<p>Pink Floyd bassist Roger Waters is due at Marc Maron\u2019s studio soon, and despite the fact that Maron grew up listening to Pink Floyd\u2019s albums, he\u2019s not anxious about the forthcoming interview. After you\u2019ve hosted the president of the United States in your garage, it\u2019s hard to be nervous about much else. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/aug/16/wtf-marc-maron-podcaster-with-presidential-approval\">WTF? Marc Maron, the podcaster with presidential approval</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Back in July 2015, as secret service officers patrolled the streets outside of Maron\u2019s Highland Park home, Barack Obama joined Maron on his WTF podcast for a discussion about race relations, fatherhood, gun violence, and overcoming fear. While such a high-profile interview could be a dream come true and a turning point for many shows, for Maron, it was just another day on the job. \u201cThat was an exciting day and an exciting week and then we got back to doing what we do,\u201d says Maron. \u201cThe podcast moved on and kept going. My TV show kept going. It was an amazing day and an amazing event. But then we just got back to work.\u201d<br></p> <p>Hosting the president didn\u2019t spark a newfound love of politics or politicians in Maron, though, and don\u2019t expect other officeholders to appear on WTF anytime soon. \u201cI\u2019m not a political show. I saw it as an American given the opportunity to talk to his president, and who\u2019s not going to do that?\u201d Maron says. Maron will always jump at the opportunity to speak directly with the commander-in-chief \u2013 even if the next president is Donald Trump, who sits on the opposite side of the political spectrum from Maron. \u201cI am wary of talking to people like that in general because in order to have a successful conversation, it has to be a <em>conversation</em>, and I\u2019m not sure he does that,\u201d says Maron. \u201cThere are certain personalities that will steamroll you. That happens in all lines of work \u2013 where it becomes a very one-sided conversation, and that\u2019s not very interesting for me.\u201d<br></p> <p>Working past the facade of public figures and getting them to open up about their private lives is Maron\u2019s stock in trade, whether he\u2019s talking to Robin Williams, Louis CK, Kristen Wiig, or Obama, but many stars and certainly many politicians aren\u2019t willing to open up in an interview. \u201cSome people expect to be interviewed, but that\u2019s not what I do. I try to engage in a conversation,\u201d Maron says. \u201cPeople who have a very ingrained public narrative can be tricky. The challenge of me talking to a president was to see if I could find those candid moments. [Obama] was thoroughly present, very present, very available, he listened. He said some things that he had said before, but there were definitely a lot of extended moments that were genuine conversation and levity and some personal, emotional things came up. He showed up for what I do and I was excited about that. That\u2019s important to me.\u201d <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8aeee2d9955d905c430b94116160d3c3611f6c03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8aeee2d9955d905c430b94116160d3c3611f6c03/0_0_1020_612/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marc Maron and Barack Obama on WTF\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marc Maron and Barack Obama on WTF</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pete Souza/The White House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maron has simply worked too hard on his show to allow his podcast to be turned into a tool for someone else\u2019s political agenda. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of how do you want to be used and are you OK with that?

For Maron, staying true to himself has frequently resulted in a blurred line between his business life and his personal life, and he\u2019s had few qualms about mining his personal life for comedic material. That may be changing, though. \u201cI have begun to keep more things to myself,\u201d says Maron. \u201cI\u2019ve learned that out of respect for other people, there are some things you don\u2019t need to talk about. I don\u2019t need to throw someone under the bus or reveal things about my relationship with somebody. It\u2019s about being respectful of others, mostly. There\u2019s about 80% transparency with me.\u201d <br></p> <p>While Maron started out as a standup comic and originally used the WTF podcast to connect with other comics and as a platform for bits, the podcast and the hours and hours of interviews he does for the show are now affecting his standup. \u201cFrom the podcast and moving through conversations and thinking out loud, I have gotten a lot more comfortable with myself and as a standup,\u201d he says. \u201cI think I am funnier than I have ever been, because I feel confident about it in a real way.

That takes time and timing and other elements need to be balanced. I have been trying to keep some stuff to myself. Most of the time people listen to a podcast sort of passively, once.

It\u2019s hard for me to think in terms of a routine,\u201d he says.<br></p> <p>Fine-tuning the routine will have to wait, though, because for now it\u2019s back to work on WTF, and Roger Waters is on his way over. <br></p> <ul> <li>Marc Maron performs at the New York comedy festival on Friday 4 November.

  "<p>Liam Fox\u2019s hopes of securing a trade deal with the European Union before Brexit have been dealt a blow by a leading member of the European parliament, who insists no deal can be struck until the UK has left the bloc.</p> <p>Danuta H\u00fcbner, a former Polish minister who became the country\u2019s first European commissioner, said it would not be possible for the UK to conclude a trade deal while still an EU member.</p> <p>Now an MEP, she chairs the European parliament\u2019s constitutional affairs committee, which will be responsible for vetting any post-Brexit free-trade agreement with the UK.<br></p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, she stressed negotiations on Britain\u2019s EU exit under article 50, due to begin next year, would be on a different track to talks on the future relationship.<br></p> <p>\u201cFormally you cannot conclude or even negotiate the agreement that belongs to a third-country situation while you are still a member. Article 50 is only about withdrawal and only when you are out can [you] negotiate another agreement.\u201d<br></p> <p>Last week, Fox, the international trade secretary, suggested the UK would aim to reach an agreement on its future trading status with the EU <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/26/eus-tough-post-brexit-stance-puts-politics-over-prosperity-says-liam-fox\">before leaving</a>. </p> <p>Criticising positions of \u201cultra-legality\u201d, Fox argued it was in the interests of both sides to avoid a situation where a regional parliament could delay a UK-EU economic agreement, in the same way the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/29/britain-must-learn-from-the-eu-canada-ceta-trade-deal-saga\">Belgian region of Wallonia blocked an EU trade deal with Canada</a>.</p> <p>Speaking to MPs on the European scrutiny committee, he said: \u201cThat sort of procedure would only be undertaken were we to leave the European Union after article 50, period, without any agreement whatsoever and were looking to seek a new FTA [free trade agreement] from outside.\u201d<br></p> <p>H\u00fcbner said the two processes, although linked, would not be merged. A trade deal would be \u201cchallenging\u201d to agree, she added, because it requires unanimity from all EU member states. The article 50 exit talks, which cover unwinding 43 years of the UK\u2019s EU membership, require only majority agreement among other member states.</p> <p>But the Polish politician was clear that the British withdrawal agreement would have to specify whether the UK was heading for hard or soft Brexit. This is in line with article 50, <a href=\"http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-European-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.html\">which states</a> that the exit agreement shall take into account \u201cthe framework for [the the departing state\u2019s] future relationship with the union\u201d. </p> <p>The MEP said: \u201cOur major challenge is how to ensure that between the withdrawal agreement and the future agreement there is no legal vacuum.\u201d</p> <p>As the British government weighs up its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/30/nissan-eu-tariff-free-brexit-sunderland\">options on the single market and customs union</a>, the EU machinery is whirring into gear to prepare for the launch of Brexit talks in spring 2017.<br></p> <p>Officially, the European parliament has no place at the negotiating table, but its consent is needed to seal the article 50 deal and any new status agreement with Brexit Britain. </p> <p>Preparations go well beyond the appointment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/guy-verhofstadt-diehard-european-to-lead-brexit-talks-for-european-parliament\">Guy Verhofstadt</a>, former Belgian prime minister and leader of the Liberal bloc, as the parliament\u2019s spokesman on the Brexit process. H\u00fcbner\u2019s constitutional affairs committee will be in charge of drafting the parliament\u2019s position on any new deal with the UK; several other committees will also weigh in, before the agreement is put to a vote by all MEPs.</p> <p>Theresa May\u2019s government should expect the European parliament to be one of the staunchest defenders of the principle of free movement of people, according to H\u00fcbner.</p> <p>\u201cWe<strong> </strong>will be the institution that will be looking with concern to the rights of citizens,\u201d she said, adding that free movement was where \u201cthe most drastic differences\u201d between the UK and rest of the EU were evident.<br></p> <p>A former Polish Europe minister, who spent years in painstaking negotiations to bring her country into the EU, she said: \u201cWe are working to facilitate free movement, not to block it and to limit it, so I don\u2019t see much chance in looking for restrictions.\u201d<br></p> <p>She rejected the idea that central and eastern European governments would cave in on this principle, in order to keep more of their talented citizens at home. \u201cYou don\u2019t control what your citizens are doing from this point of view,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is up to people to evaluate their future and their chances and have the freedom of moving and working wherever there is a job.\u201d<br></p> <p>She contrasted Poles, Romanians and Spaniards, who worked in the UK and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/18/mass-eu-migration-into-britain-is-actually-good-news-for-uk-economy\">paid more taxes than they received in benefits</a>, with British pensioners living in Spain, who were likely to take advantage of the Spanish healthcare system. \u201cIt is not fair that in UK, politicians do not explain how much you have benefited from the free movement of labour.\u201d</p> <p>Describing Brexit as a \u201cmajor mistake\u201d in European history, she said she would prefer to be in a union of 28, with the UK. But she is not convinced a hard Brexit is inevitable and predicted that economic arguments would win out over demands for curbs on immigration. </p> <p>She predicted a shift from \u201cpurely political considerations\u201d towards a stance that takes greater account of the economic repercussions of Brexit. But she still regretted the Brexit choice. </p> <p>\u201cSuch a decision is not made for a week or a year, it is for a generation.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>New legal guidance for universities on <a href=\"http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Pages/changing-the-culture-final-report.aspx\">how to deal with alleged student misconduct </a>\u2013 including violence against women, harassment and hate crimes \u2013 has been issued by Universities UK, the umbrella organisation for sector leaders, and it\u2019s a welcome step forward. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/21/university-sex-abuse-report-fails-staff-attacks-students\">University sex abuse report fails to tackle staff attacks on UK students</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the first time, it recognises that universities themselves can initiate disciplinary action for possible criminal offences and can also impose precautionary measures, such as the exclusion or suspension of an accused student.<br></p> <p>The problem is that the guidance applies to a multitude of crimes \u2013 and one size does not fit all. The issues that arise in relation to allegations of theft or criminal damage are very different from those that relate to sexual misconduct.</p> <h2>The definition of rape</h2> <p>The guidance states that it is \u201cunreasonable and dangerous\u201d (p10) for a university to make a finding of rape, and states that \u201cthe alleged \u2018offence\u2019 will be different\u201d (p12) in a disciplinary process. This is technically correct. A university cannot find anyone guilty of the criminal offence of rape, as it is not a criminal court. However, the example sets out misconduct as \u201csexual intercourse without consent\u201d (p14), which is in essence the definition of rape.</p> <p>So in determining \u201cwhether the alleged facts and matters occurred\u201d (p10), albeit to a lower threshold of proof than in a criminal trial, the disciplinary panel is in effect called to determine whether it is more likely than not that a rape occurred. The facts of the case will be the same whether it is called rape or \u201csexual misconduct\u201d.</p> <p>Universities are left in the difficult position of having to investigate and gather evidence as to whether the rape happened. And they are not given any further guidance as to what constitutes appropriate evidence. </p> <p>Nor are universities guided as to who should gather evidence and exactly what training such an investigator should undergo, for example, in order to satisfactorily question witnesses.</p> <h2>Myths about victims</h2> <p>Given that in very many rape and sexual assault cases the issue is not if the incident occurred but whether or not it was consensual, it is very likely that investigators, and then disciplinary panels, will find themselves having to assess the credibility of conflicting accounts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/oct/21/i-was-being-stalked-but-my-university-refused-to-protect-me\">I was being stalked, but my university refused to protect me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is here that I think there is most cause for concern. It is well-documented in research that sexual offences evoke responses based on societal attitudes and beliefs around appropriate sexual behaviour. People make assumptions about consent and credibility based on \u201crape myths\u201d which tend to blame the victim and justify the behaviour of the perpetrator. These myths relate to how the victim was dressed, her alcohol consumption, whether she flirted or somehow \u201cinvited\u201d the assault, whether she resisted, how she behaved during and after the assault and her general sexual behaviour.</p> <p>Are university administrators and managers somehow exempt from having such attitudes? Particularly worrying in this regard is a reference to \u201cthe facts and matters leading to an allegation\u201d (p10) which could be interpreted as inviting universities to assess exactly these types of factors. </p> <p>The criminal justice system recognises and makes provision for the complexities of decision-making in sexual offence cases: judges must attend intensive residential training courses, juries are to be directed about reliance on rape myths, and there is a set of rules relating to the admissibility of sexual history evidence and the capacity to consent.</p> <p>Yet the UUK\u2019s guidance for universities is silent on these key issues of rape myths and victim-blaming.</p> <h2>Gaps in the guidelines</h2> <p>The guidance suggests that terms such as \u201cconsent\u201d \u2013 which may need interpreting in a disciplinary process \u2013 be defined in the university\u2019s code of conduct. It recommends that the legal definition of consent be used, yet that definition itself has been subject to much academic criticism for its lack of clarity. It would be better for the UUK to offer a definition for universities to use.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/07/i-was-so-traumatised-accounts-of-sexual-harassment-in-uk-universities\">'I was so traumatised': accounts of sexual harassment in UK universities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are some very positive recommendations, such as that victims be protected in evidence-giving, for example, by use of video link, and that the accused student has the right to hear the evidence against them.</p> <p>But despite the excellence of the steering group in their own fields, the absence of sexual offence lawyers has led to some worrying gaps in the guidance. I think that the legal guidance should be revisited by UUK. More detailed pointers on how to gather and assess evidence, and the appropriate training required for investigators and adjudicators, needs to be set out.</p> <p><em>Rachel Fenton writes about sexual offences law and is principal investigator for The Intervention Initiative, a bystander intervention for the prevention of sexual and domestic violence in university settings. </em></p> <p><strong>Join the <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/higher-education-network#https://register.theguardian.com/higher-education/?CMP=dis_57\">higher education network</a> for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

  "<p>Mozilla Firefox is dropping a feature that lets websites see how much battery life a visitor has left, following research showing that it could be used to track browsers.</p> <p>The feature, called the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/02/battery-status-indicators-tracking-online\">battery status API</a>, allows websites to request information about the capacity of a visitor\u2019s device, such as whether or not it\u2019s plugged in and charging, how long it will last until it is empty, and the percentage of charge remaining.</p> <p>It was intended to allow websites to offer less energy-intensive versions of their sites to visitors with little battery power left: for instance, a mapping site could download less information, or a social network could disable autoplaying video.</p> <p>But in 2015, the Guardian reported that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/03/privacy-smartphones-battery-life\">researchers had discovered</a> that it was easy to abuse the feature to track browsing on the internet.</p> <p>For instance, if a user visits a website in private browsing mode using a VPN, the website should not be able to link them to a subsequent visit with private browsing and the VPN off. But the researchers warned that that may no longer work: \u201cUsers who try to revisit a website with a new identity may use browsers\u2019 private mode or clear cookies and other client side identifiers. When consecutive visits are made within a short interval, the website can link users\u2019 new and old identities by exploiting battery level and charge/discharge times. The website can then re-instantiate users\u2019 cookies and other client side identifiers, a method known as respawning.\u201d</p> <p>A year later, the Guardian reported that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/02/battery-status-indicators-tracking-online\">the hypothetical abuse had became a reality</a>, with two security researchers from Princeton University discovering tracking scripts being used in the wild to \u201cfingerprint\u201d a specific device, allowing them to continuously identify it across multiple contexts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81fe37c973f65e863c24c8e74f886b85378d89c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81fe37c973f65e863c24c8e74f886b85378d89c0/0_92_1896_1137/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Firefox logo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Firefox was one of three browsers that brought the battery status API to the public, along with Chrome and Opera.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josep Lago/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That final discovery gave the developers of Mozilla\u2019s Firefox browser the motivation to remove the functionality from the program. Firefox was one of three browsers that brought the battery status API to the public, along with Chrome and Opera. The feature was <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1313580\">finally removed on 27 October</a>, a year and five months after the first concerns were raised.</p> <p>Lukasz Olejnik, a London-based security and privacy consultant and a researcher at UCL, was one of the four researchers who originally discovered the potential for abuse of the battery status API. He says he\u2019s \u201cvery happy to see the impact made by my security and privacy works\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI did not expect a web browser to completely purge an API, it\u2019s unprecedented. I am not aware of any similar development in the web\u2019s history,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Olejnik was sanguine about the delay in taking action, saying \u201cI think that what matters most is the outcome. We suggested some changes in 2015, and expanded mitigation strategies were proposed this year. Mozilla has decided to completely remove the functionality. The fact that this is happening due to privacy concerns is ultimately important. We went a long way with understanding the importance of privacy, user control and awareness\u201d.</p> <p>In a statement, Mozilla said: \u201cIn 2015 security researchers published findings that pointed to the Battery Status API as a potential privacy leak. It\u2019s now disabled for web content but still available to Firefox add-ons. While the battery API is part of the HTML5 specification, IE, Edge, and Safari never implemented the API and there few common uses in the real-world outside of fingerprinting. The removal of this API will take effect with Firefox 52, and will reduce the amount of information that may be used to track users on the web.\u201d</p> <p>While Mozilla is currently the only browser vendor to have actively removed the Battery Status API, others have taken note of the same problems. Developers of Webkit, the open-source browser on which Apple\u2019s Safari is based, <a href=\"https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2016-October/028469.html\">have also proposed removing code supporting the API from their project</a>. But unlike Firefox, Safari never shipped the API to end users.</p> <p>The Guardian has asked Google and Opera for comment. Apple has declined to comment.</p>",

  "<p>The Serious Fraud Office has been given special funding to pursue its criminal investigation into a firm that has been implicated in an international bribery scandal.</p> <p>The Treasury has awarded the extra money for the agency\u2019s inquiry into a Monaco-based firm, Unaoil, which is accused of corruptly securing contracts for dozens of multinationals. <br></p> <p>Unaoil was hired to work in various parts of the world by the British company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/rollsroycegroup\">Rolls-Royce</a> plc, which is also under investigation by the SFO. The further expansion of the SFO inquiry comes four years after it first started looking at Rolls-Royce. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/31/rolls-royce-middlemen-may-have-used-bribes-to-land-major-contracts\">A Guardian/BBC investigation published on Monday</a> revealed how extensive it has become.</p> <p>On Monday night one of Unaoil\u2019s former employees admitted to bribing a Libyan government official in an interview with the BBC\u2019s Panorama programme.</p> <p>The whistleblower, Lindsay Mitchell, said that in 2009 he handed an envelope filled with US dollars to a manager at a subsidiary of the state-owned Libyan National Oil Company. According to Mitchell, the man had made clear he could help Unaoil\u2019s clients obtain a contract from the Libyan government. <br></p> <p>Mitchell\u2019s interview marks the first time a former Unaoil insider has gone on the record to allege misconduct at the firm. He is reportedly cooperating with law enforcement, and has said he would be willing to testify against his former employer.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/19/serious-office-opens-criminal-investigation-into-unaoil\">The SFO\u2019s investigation into Unaoil began this year</a> after a leak of thousands of the firm\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/interactive/2016/the-bribe-factory/day-1/the-company-that-bribed-the-world.html\">emails to journalists at Australia\u2019s Fairfax Media</a>. Authorities in the UK, US and Australia are understood to be investigating the firm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/01/authorities-monaco-raid-oil-firm-unaoil-hq-corruption-investigation\">following a raid in March of the company\u2019s headquarters</a> by police in Monaco.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.unaoil.com/news/press-releases/statement-from-unaoil/\">Unaoil has denied that it has been involved in bribery</a>, adding that it intends to sue journalists over the \u201cmalicious and damaging allegations\u201d. The company also said some of the information that formed the basis of the allegations against it \u201chas been gathered as a result of criminal activity including extortion\u201d.</p> <p>The award of the special financing by the Treasury \u2013 known in official jargon as \u201cblockbuster funding\u201d \u2013 has previously been granted for a small number of major SFO investigations. These include the rigging of the Libor interest rate, a Kazakh mining company accused of corruption, and the Rolls-Royce inquiry. </p> <p>The amount of money awarded to the SFO for its Unaoil inquiry is not known. However, the award indicates that the inquiry is now one of its largest investigations. For four years, the SFO has been investigating allegations that Rolls-Royce hired middlemen to land contracts around the world. Rolls-Royce said it was fully cooperating with this and other official investigations and could not comment further. </p> <p>The Guardian/BBC investigation identified 12 countries where Rolls-Royce used commercial advisers or middlemen to obtain contracts. The company hired Unaoil in five countries, according to documents leaked to Fairfax Media. </p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b081ztvv\">interview with BBC Panorama</a>, Mitchell described depositing an envelope filled with cash at the Libyan official\u2019s house late one evening. \u201cI made the payment at the gentleman\u2019s house at 11 o\u2019clock at night, dropped it off,\u201d he said. \u201cI just dropped it off and said: \u2018Here\u2019s your gift.\u2019\u201d The two men then had coffee at the official\u2019s house.</p>",

  "<p>I\u2019ve got a pretty good CV when it comes to long distance events. Three Great South Runs, a marathon earlier this year and a 24-hour endurance event in April in which I covered 70 miles. So why has the Brighton Marathon told me that I need a chaperone if I want to take part? Because I\u2019m a wheelchair user. Yes, I thought it was 2016 too.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard sometimes to explain everything a disabled person <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/26/person-disabilities-trailblazer-society-convince-life\" title=\"\">comes up against in everyday life</a> without sounding like a tantrum-throwing two-year-old, but each day I accept <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/18/nine-things-never-say-wheelchair-user\" title=\"\">being patronised</a>, I accept people assuming that I can\u2019t manage, I accept people rushing over to assist. I put up with these <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/23/life-wheelchair-disabled-people-equal-rights\" title=\"\">never-ending attacks on my independence</a> with as much grace as I can muster because, after all, people are just trying to help. There isn\u2019t enough kindness in the world for me to go around refusing it.</p> <p>But I am a gutsy, determined, never-say-die son-of-a-gun,<strong> </strong>and as much as I will accept kindness, I refuse to let anyone tell me what I am and am not capable of. So on looking into entering the Brighton Marathon and seeing <a href=\"http://www.brightonmarathon.co.uk/faqs\" title=\"\">in the FAQs</a> under \u201cCan I take part with a wheelchair?\u201d the phrasing, \u201cIf you have a standard wheelchair \u2026 this will be allowed \u2026 provided another participant is pushing the chair \u2026\u201d I\u2019ll be honest with you: I was furious.</p> <p>Because from the day I was born without tibia bones, which resulted in both my legs being amputated a few months later, I have proved people wrong time and time again.</p> <p>So imagine how angry I was to be told I couldn\u2019t compete in a sporting event? That I\u2019m not a valid participant; that I can take part, but, umm, not really \u2026 just be quiet now and go away, will you? I cannot and I will not accept that. I am too old and too proud.</p> <p>Brighton is the only such major marathon in the UK to insist upon the infantilisation of disabled athletes, because parts of the course are not accessible and \u201ccould pose significant problems should they run into difficulty\u201d. Yes, they actually sent me a direct message on Twitter with that phrasing. Hilarious? I nearly fell out of my chair.</p> <p>If the course could pose significant problems, change the course! Not just for me, I know I\u2019m not that important, but for everyone who ever wanted to do something and were told they couldn\u2019t because someone else didn\u2019t believe they were able to. Why not find out if a wheelchair athlete can complete your course, instead of assuming they can\u2019t. Stop seeing the \u201cdis\u201d and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/06/the-guardian-view-on-the-paralympics-focus-on-ability-not-disability\" title=\"\">start seeing the \u201cability\u201d</a>.</p> <p>I am a guy who happens to have no legs but who pushes myself (lol, as the young folk say) as hard as I can in order to prove, over and over again, that there is nothing others can do that I cannot. My message is simple: your limitations are not my limitations.</p> <p>I\u2019ve received lots of support on social media, along with friends emailing the Brighton Marathon in protest. So much so that on the same day they insisted I must be pushed around the course, the organisers amended the wording on their website to say people like me are \u201cable to take part but on the agreement that the wheelchair user is accompanied by a runner throughout the 26.2 miles. The accompanying runner does not have to push the wheelchair during the race but must participate alongside them throughout\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/06/paralympians-superhumans-disabled-people\">Turning Paralympians into \u2018superhumans\u2019 is no help to disabled people | Penny Pepper</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What this non-concession means is that I must still be babysat, albeit with my babysitter allowed to back off a few inches. Sorry, but that still isn\u2019t good enough. If I can\u2019t do this alone, how can I ever prove that I am able to do it alone?</p> <p>The point is this: we\u2019re not the same, you and I. And nor are all disabled athletes the same. Some with less mobility than me might quite enjoy being pushed round the course. Equally, some might like someone to chat to along the route and to be there as a fail-safe should they, ahem, run into difficulty. But not me. I\u2019ll do it my way. It is my victory or my defeat. No one gets to tell me what I achieve; no one gets to tell me what I fail at.</p> <p>This is my story of refusing to accept anyone else choosing my limitations. Because you don\u2019t have to be able to stand up in order to stand up for yourself.</p>",
  "<p>The UK must strike back at hostile states in cyberspace and be capable of mounting sophisticated cyber-attacks of its own in place of military strikes, the chancellor has said.</p> <p>Philip Hammond said that unless the UK could match the cyber-attack abilities of foreign rogue states, the alternatives would only be to ignore digital attacks on Britain\u2019s infrastructure or use military force. </p> <p>Launching the government\u2019s \u00a31.9bn national cybersecurity strategy, Hammond said the UK had to develop \u201cfully functioning cyber-attack capability\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIf we do not have the ability to respond in cyberspace to an attack that takes down our power networks, leaving us in darkness, or hits our air traffic control system, grounding our planes, we would be left with the impossible choice of turning the other cheek and ignoring the devastating consequences or resorting to a military response.\u201d</p> <p>Hammond said the world\u2019s next great conflict was likely to at least begin in cyberspace, before guns were loaded. </p> <p>\u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that the precursor to any future state-on-state conflict will be a campaign of escalating cyber-attacks, to break down our defences and test our resolve before the first shot is fired,\u201d he said in a speech on Tuesday at Microsoft\u2019s Future Decoded conference.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PHammondMP/status/793434727357308929\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">New strategy will allow us to take greater steps to defend ourselves in cyberspace &amp;strike back when we are attacked <a href=\"https://t.co/SRvlmlQtB5\">https://t.co/SRvlmlQtB5</a></p>&mdash; Philip Hammond (@PHammondMP) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PHammondMP/status/793434727357308929\">November 1, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Hostile states appeared to believe cyber-attacks were far less risky, Hammond said. \u201cKinetic attacks carry huge risk of retaliation and may breach international law, but in cyberspace those who want to harm us appear to think that they can act scalably and deniably,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Hammond said the new funding, which doubles the amount set out in 2011 in a similar strategy, will \u201callow us to take even greater steps to defend ourselves in cyberspace and to strike back when we are attacked\u201d.</p> <p>Speaking before the launch, the Cabinet Office minister Ben Gummer said cyber warfare was \u201cno longer the stuff of spy thrillers and action movies ... Our adversaries are varied \u2013 organised criminal groups, \u2018hacktivists\u2019, untrained teenagers and foreign states\u201d.</p> <p>The funds will focus on defences for critical infrastructure such as energy and transport. Websites impersonating government departments will be shut down much more quickly, and efforts will be made to crack down on spoof email accounts used in fraud cases. The reforms include a new cyber-innovation centre in Cheltenham. </p> <p>Hammond\u2019s announcement came as Russia rebuffed claims made to the Guardian by the head of MI5, Andrew Parker, that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/01/kremlin-pours-cold-water-on-mi5-chiefs-andrew-parker-claims\">Kremlin was behind hostile manoeuvres against Britain</a>. </p> <p>Parker told the Guardian that Moscow was \u201cusing its whole range of state organs and powers to push its foreign policy abroad in increasingly aggressive ways \u2013 involving propaganda, espionage, subversion and cyber-attacks. Russia is at work across Europe and in the UK today. It is MI5\u2019s job to get in the way of that\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThose words do not correspond to reality,\u201d Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, said on Tuesday. \u201cUntil someone produces proof we will consider those statements unfounded and groundless.\u201d</p>",

My eldest grandchild, aged 11, is extremely anxious about political events, particularly potential terrorist attacks. She has become worried about travelling on the tube in London when she visits me. She is also worried about going into big shopping centres because of the threat of bombs and was deeply concerned after the Paris attacks. She is not at all frightened by any supposed Muslim threat \u2013 indeed, she is rather pro\u2013Muslim having many Muslim peers, which is a good and reassuring aspect of modern children\u2019s education, but she is insecure about being suddenly attacked in a place that she previously experienced as familiar and fun. She loves coming to London but feels being there is nowadays more dangerous. These concerns affect her sleep. She has confided she has periods of lying awake, worrying about terrorism and reassurances that it will not happen to her do not, and in my view cannot, dispel her concerns. My experience of working with trauma convinces me that anxiety needs to be addressed and not given a superficial bandage of comfort. </p> <p>My granddaughter doesn\u2019t have a computer or iPod, or direct access to the web on her phone, but inevitably she sees the news with her parents and hears about what\u2019s happening in school from other children who tend to big up scary events. Inevitably, she absorbs often false or exaggerated information from her peers who have access to social media while she cannot check out the truth what they say. In my view, the current state of the world needs to be discussed in schools as well as at home, and the spreading of rumour and gossip about scary events needs to be addressed more fully as a serious element in the school curriculum. </p> <p>Teachers need to rethink how children are introduced to political world events now there is so much greater access to them. More consideration needs to be given to the way social media, which can now feed into a bullying process, affects children. Bullying is hardly a novel phenomenon in schools but I don\u2019t think we are really up to speed with the way political events can be deployed to terrify the less well informed or the more sensitive. There needs to be greater education on civic responsibility for everyone and I believe for the sake of a responsible future society it should start at a younger age. Children need to be taught to look at the news and public reactions critically and not take them at face value, in the way they were once taught to be critical of texts.</p> <h2>Amet Akolawin, 28, from London: \u2018My daughter gets more anxious about issues such as global warming\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1a55a33907dd4a64b1945f8ac1cf7904cd678910\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a55a33907dd4a64b1945f8ac1cf7904cd678910/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Amet Akolawin\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My daughter, who turns eight next week, watches the news when I do, so in the morning and evening. She also watches CBBC\u2019s Newsround most days. We do talk about the headlines a lot, she takes an interest in what is going on around the world.<br></p> <p>She does worry about some of the stuff she sees, just yesterday at bedtime we spoke about the US election and the wall Donald Trump wishes to build between Mexico and America. It lead on to us chatting about the Berlin Wall and the Great Wall of China. My daughter is very inquisitive so talking about news is an simple way to give her some insight and pass on some of my knowledge.</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t like watching clips of war-torn countries, but she will still listen to what the report is saying. She is quite sensitive so if there is a piece on Syria, for example, and I think the images are disturbing, her I will ask her if she would like to watch something else.</p> <p>To be honest she gets more anxiety from topics touched on in school, such as global warming and natural disasters. We go to visit her gran in Sardinia twice a year and much of the news recently has been about the earthquake there. She has become very fixated about this and I haven\u2019t been able to reassure her about. Her uncle lives in Rome so it\u2019s understandable that she would worry but it\u2019s definitely made her afraid of something similar happening to her when she\u2019s there.</p> <h2>Jessica Eaton, 26, from Staffordshire: \u2018My sons worry they will end up as refugees and no one will take care of them\u2019</h2> <p>My sons, who are five and eight, had a shocking realisation about three months ago that the war in Syria was real. They had been in the room with me and my husband when we were discussing the decision to launch airstrikes in Syria. We were watching footage about the civilian casualties and condemning the decision. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They have lots and lots of questions about war, politics and weapons.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The boys went away to play for a while and must have got talking because they came back into the living room shortly afterwards very upset, saying: \u201cReal people are dying in Syria, with real guns and bombs.\u201d They had got confused between \u201creal\u201d and \u201cpretend war\u201d because of how war is depicted in video games and the fact that they have toy guns. My five-year-old son started to cry, saying: \u201cWe need to stop the shops and the government from selling things that try to make war and bombs and guns fun because it\u2019s real mum. It\u2019s happening in Syria.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time the news has made them upset: my boys worry a lot about war and nuclear weapons. They also worry that they might end up refugees too and no one will love them or want them. </p> <p>They have lots and lots of questions about war, politics and weapons. I don\u2019t shield them from current affairs and I don\u2019t lie to them, but instead spend time explaining stuff and suggesting empowering solutions, such as getting them to make posters or write a letter to the government. We have also registered to take in refugee children for fostering. </p> <p>While the media is busy playing everyone off against one another, children are absorbing dangerous messages from all sides. Our children spend more time using technology than any other generation and are very engaged in the media. I would prefer them to experience moral uncertainty and question everything they read rather than just swallowing information.</p> <h2>Anonymous, 41, from London: \u2018My eldest worries about animals dying and the destruction of the earth\u2019</h2> <p>My eldest, who is nine, has been very worried about climate change since he did a class project on habitats last year. He often talks about environmental issues, such as animals dying, trees disappearing and the general destruction of the earth. </p> <p>Both my children actually stopped eating meat last year and decided to become vegetarian. There\u2019s a lot of focus on this issue and they cry when they think about animals being killed. They even made a How to Save Our Planet game together.</p> <p>We don\u2019t allow our children to watch the news: the images are too graphic and the language is not suitable for under 10s. They occasionally hear the news on the radio, but we monitor their internet use, only letting them online for a limited time. They don\u2019t have access to any social media despite their protests.

He usually asks questions about stories four or five weeks after he has seen them, which makes me think he\u2019s been worrying for all that time. A particular concern for him at the moment is Donald Trump getting elected. At the time of the primaries he picked up on him being a joke candidate and being a disaster for the world if elected. Some of his friends in schools do Donald Trump impressions that their parents taught them, so Trump is a bit of a funny character in school. But then he hears phrases like, \u201cThis man could have his finger on the nuclear button,\u201d and gets worried. He takes things very literally so imagines there actually being a button. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Brexit result really upset him.

He is not on social media as he is too young and I don\u2019t think any of his friends are either.</p> <p>The Brexit result really upset him. It got to the point where we were late to school that morning trying to calm him down. He thought that it was the worst news he had ever heard. He was so scared of leaving Europe. I take the blame for that really, as I didn\u2019t see it coming. I gave him a very polemic view of why we should stay and no insight really into why some people wanted to leave. I am hoping to give him more information on news events now so he is less anxious. A few weeks ago, for example, I signed up to <a href=\"http://theweekjunior.co.uk/about-junior/?ppcad=true&amp;gclid=CK3jw8HLh9ACFaEL0wodbVUFZA\">The Week Junior</a>, which is a magazine that explains big news events to children.</p> <h2>Anonymous, 45, from Kent: \u2018We need to help children analyse media stories and sources of information\u2019</h2> <p>Since the age of seven my daughter has worried about global events but it\u2019s not had a negative impact. She listens to the radio, reads The Week Junior and watches Newsround daily. If she wants to find out more, we research it together online. We discuss stories and sources of news regularly.<br><br>After the Paris attacks, a number of children were pulled out of a trip to London. I discussed this with my daughter and explained that the government does all it can to keep citizens safe, and why you can\u2019t let terrorists win. We thought about what we could do, so she wrote to David Cameron and got a response a few weeks later. It\u2019s important to give children a way to try to positively effect change. We also need to help them to understand risk and analyse media stories, and sources of information.</p>",

The movement is not only changing the way people travel through Costa Rica\u2019s cities, but is also pushing forward the country\u2019s stagnant goal to <a href=\"http://www4.unfccc.int/ndcregistry/PublishedDocuments/Costa%20Rica%20First/INDC%20Costa%20Rica%20Version%202%200%20final%20ENG.pdf\">become carbon neutral by 2021</a> (pdf).<br></p> <p>The morning after their vigilante street painting mission, the cycling activists were back on their bikes to promote World Car-Free Day, celebrated for the first time in Costa Rica on 22 September. Along with encouraging people to leave their cars at home, the event organisers planned a bike tour to draw attention to the city\u2019s lack of cycling infrastructure.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ChepeCletasCR/\">Chepecletas</a>, the country\u2019s first major urban cycling group formed in 2010, shortly after Costa Rica declared its carbon neutral goal. The group started small, with the aim of hosting nocturnal bike tours in San Jos\u00e9, to challenge negative perceptions about the city and cycling in general. Aside from dealing with the city\u2019s narrow, pothole ridden avenues, Chepecletas had to push back against San Jos\u00e9\u2019s bad reputation for crime, filth and a general lack of interesting sites and activities. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0dd19dea9ccd14577dbdf31c77eb5ad2a88eb614\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dd19dea9ccd14577dbdf31c77eb5ad2a88eb614/0_653_5475_3285/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A volunteer for World Car Free Day gives opening remarks to cycles for a city bike tour.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A volunteer for World Car-Free Day gives opening remarks to cycles for a city bike tour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lindsay Fendt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn San Jos\u00e9 you didn\u2019t see many people who were proud of their city,\u201d says Chepecletas founder Roberto Guzman. \u201cIn general, the people that come here say very negative things.

Despite using renewables for nearly all of its electricity, Costa Rica still relies heavily on fossil fuels. Hydrocarbons make up <a href=\"http://www.nacion.com/vivir/ambiente/Tercera-Comunicacion-Nacional-Convencion-Climatico_LNCFIL20141124_0001.pdf\">67% of the country\u2019s energy use</a> (pdf), nearly half of which is used to power private cars.</p> <p>In part, it is due to the country\u2019s deeply fragmented government structure, which divides the responsibility for transportation in the GAM between three different national ministries, 31 municipal governments and countless consulting boards. Even widely supported ideas, like the transportation ministry\u2019s recent plans for a cycleway, often meet a dead end when the government arms fail to coordinate. </p> <p>\u201cThe ministry only had the budget to design the path, not to build it,\u201d says Josselyne Murillo, one of the engineers who designed the cycleway. \u201cIt will be built once the municipality has the money.\u201d <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb2e15f3fe076b082164cf585768cc970b95e87a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb2e15f3fe076b082164cf585768cc970b95e87a/0_464_4485_2690/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cycling activists embark on a city bike tour for World Car Free Day in San Jos\u00e9.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cycling activists embark on a city bike tour for World Car-Free Day in San Jos\u00e9.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lindsay Fendt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These tasks are now being picked up by civil society.

  "<p>Haruki Murakami has warned that \u201cno matter how high a wall we build to keep intruders out, no matter how strictly we exclude outsiders, no matter how much we rewrite history to suit us, we just end up damaging and hurting ourselves\u201d.</p> <p>Speaking as he received the <a href=\"http://cphpost.dk/news/odense-honours-haruki-murakami-with-hans-christian-andersen-award.html\">Hans Christian Andersen literature award</a>, the Japanese novelist said that \u201cjust as all people have shadows, every society and nation, too, has shadows\u201d, and \u201cif there are bright, shining aspects, there will definitely be a counterbalancing dark side. If there\u2019s a positive, there will surely be a negative on the reverse side.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt times we tend to avert our eyes from the shadow, those negative parts. Or else try to forcibly eliminate those aspects. Because people want to avoid, as much as possible, looking at their own dark sides, their negative qualities. But in order for a statue to appear solid and three-dimensional, you need to have shadows. Do away with shadows and all you end up with is a flat illusion. Light that doesn\u2019t generate shadows is not true light,\u201d said the novelist.</p> <p> He continued: \u201cYou have to patiently learn to live together with your shadow. And carefully observe the darkness that resides within you. Sometimes in a dark tunnel you have to confront your own dark side.\u201d</p> <p>Murakami was announced as winner of the Hans Christian Andersen prize a year ago, but received the prize this weekend. The 500,000DKK award, for writing which \u201ccan be linked to Andersen\u2019s name and authorship through genre similarities or storyteller-artistic qualities\u201d has previously been won by authors including JK Rowling and Salman Rushdie. Murakami was cited for his \u201c capacity to boldly mix classic narrative art, pop culture, Japanese tradition, dreamlike realism and philosophical discussion\u201d, which judges said \u201cmakes him a fitting heir to the Andersen legacy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201dMurakami\u2019s ability to combine the everyday and reality with magic and fairytale derives from a linguistic mastery that once again makes one think of Hans Christian Andersen. There are images and descriptions of natural scenery, cityscapes and landscapes in Murakami that possess a distinctive poetry,\u201d said committee member and professor Anne-Marie Mai from the University of Southern Denmark in a speech at the ceremony.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/06/colorless-tsukuru-tazaki-years-pilgimage-haruki-murakami-review\">Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage by Haruki Murakami \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The novelist, author of books including <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/06/winter-reads-norwegian-wood-haruki-murakami\">Norwegian Wood</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jan/08/fiction.harukimurakami\">Kafka on the Shore</a>, called his speech in Denmark The Meaning of Shadows, in honour of Andersen\u2019s story <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://hca.gilead.org.il/shadow.html\">The Shadow</a>. Andersen\u2019s tale sees a learned man send his shadow away, only for the shadow to gradually take on human form and have his old master killed.

Instead of using my head, in other words, it\u2019s through moving my hand in the process of writing that I think. In those times I value what\u2019s in my unconscious above what\u2019s in my conscious mind,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Critics today, as well as many readers, \u201ctend to read stories in an analytical way,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are trained in schools, or by society, that that\u2019s the correct reading methodology. People analyse, and critique, texts, from an academic perspective, a sociological perspective, or a psychoanalytic perspective.\u201d</p> <p>But \u201cif a novelist tries to construct a story analytically, the story\u2019s inherent vitality will be lost\u201d, because \u201cempathy between writer and readers won\u2019t arise\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOften we see that the novels that critics rave about are ones readers don\u2019t particularly like, but in many cases it\u2019s because works that critics see as analytically excellent fail to win the natural empathy of readers,\u201d said the author.</p> <p>Murakami did not elaborate on his warning about walls and outsiders, but <a href=\"http://www.japantoday.com/smartphone/view/national/murakami-warns-against-excluding-outsiders-in-denmark-award-speech\">Japanese press speculated </a>that he was \u201creferring to the increasingly mounting anti-refugee and anti-immigrant sentiment in Europe and elsewhere\u201d. In 2009, when he was awarded the Jerusalem prize for the Freedom of the Individual in Society in the face of opposition from pro-Palestinian groups, he said that \u201cif there is a hard, high wall and an egg that breaks against it, no matter how right the wall or how wrong the egg, I will stand on the side of the egg. Why? Because each of us is an egg, a unique soul enclosed in a fragile egg. Each of us is confronting a high wall. The high wall is the system which forces us to do the things we would not ordinarily see fit to do as individuals.</p> <p>\u201cWe have no hope against the wall: it\u2019s too high, too dark, too cold,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/16/haruki-murakami-jerusalem-prize\">he said in Jerusalem</a>. \u201cTo fight the wall, we must join our souls together for warmth, strength. We must not let the system control us \u2013 create who we are. It is we who created the system.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>The chancellor, Phillip Hammond, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/01/philp-hammond-to-spend-extra-19bn-fighting-cyber-attacks\">has announced a \u00a31.9bn investment in Britain\u2019s cybersecurity strategy</a>. The money is to be used to protect the country from hacking attacks on all fronts, from opportunistic raids on individuals and businesses to focused cyberwar led by state-run teams.</p> <p>Hammond has promised a big sum, but the world of hacking is easily large enough to occupy all that money and more. It\u2019s double the amount set out for a similar strategy in 2011, but has to deal with a world where cybercrime has moved from science-fiction novels and Hollywood movies to our banks, phones and even kettles.</p> <h2><strong>What are cyber-attacks?</strong></h2> <p>The range of misdeeds which can be described as a cyber-attack is vast, and demands a similarly large range of responses.</p> <p>At the most technically complex end, cyber-attacks can entail a close-knit team of elite hackers working under the remit of a nation state to create programs which take advantage of previously unknown flaws in software \u2013 called 0days, or zero-days, for the amount of time the manufacturer has had to fix them \u2013 in order to exfiltrate confidential data, damage key infrastructure, or develop a beachhead for further attacks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/27/how-to-be-a-hacker\">How to be a hacker</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Examples of that sort of cyberwarfare include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/sep/30/stuxnet-worm-new-era-global-cyberwar\">the Stuxnet worm</a>, a specially made computer virus attributed to the US and Israel, which was deliberately designed to infect and damage centrifuges used in the Iranian nuclear programme, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/09/opm-hack-21-million-personal-information-stolen\">the 2015 hack of the Office of Personnel Management</a>, attributed to China, which led to the personal information of millions of US government workers being stolen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"237307d15840db9e27d04d80192c9e02970bdc8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/237307d15840db9e27d04d80192c9e02970bdc8f/0_132_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The heavy water nuclear facility near Arak, Iran.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The heavy water nuclear facility near Arak, Iran.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hamid Foroutan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most dangerous hacking groups are known as \u201cadvanced persistent threats\u201d (APTs): not only nation-states, but highly competent criminal organisations that carry out technically difficult targeted hacks. </p> <p>But not all cyber-attacks involve high-end technical skills or state-sponsored actors. At the opposite end of the scale are hacks that take advantage of long-fixed security mistakes, ambiguities in user interfaces, and even good old-fashioned human oversight.</p> <p>Many hackers are opportunistic, picking not the most valuable targets but the most lightly defended ones, such as computers that haven\u2019t had security updates installed, or users who will happily click on malicious links if they are told that their bank sent them.</p> <p>If APTs are like the Hatton Garden Heist, these hackers are the sort of people who will grab an unattended handbag and run. It may be less impressive, but for the vast majority of computer users, that\u2019s the sort of cybercrime they should spend more of their time defending against.</p> <h2><strong>Does cyber-crime even have to include hacking?</strong></h2> <p>Not according to Hammond. Some of the government\u2019s past successes in fighting cybercrime involve tackling \u201cphishing\u201d, the practice of sending a fake email purporting to be from a trusted sender to encourage the recipient to enter confidential information.</p> <p>Phishing can be fought by taking down the servers that collect the confidential information, which the government has been doing, but also by education: teaching individuals how to recognise a phishing email, and how to tell real websites from fake.</p> <p>At its simplest end, cybercrime may not even involve computers much at all. \u201cSocial engineering\u201d is the name in the hacker community for convincing an organisation or individual to do things they shouldn\u2019t, and is an important part of the hacker toolkit. For instance, Mat Honan, a Wired reporter, had <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/\">his entire digital life erased</a> when hackers convinced Apple to reset his iCloud password with information they had convinced Amazon to hand over \u2013 all using nothing more complex than a phone call.</p> <p>And then there are the simplest \u201chacks\u201d of all: just logging into things using the default passwords. That\u2019s how a rag-tag collection of cheap \u201csmart\u201d devices like webcams and kettles ended up being corralled into a network big enough to take down most of the internet for the east coast of the US two weeks ago.</p> <h2><strong>How can kettles take down the internet?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d27be930b25700450b29efd575faa4561648c56a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d27be930b25700450b29efd575faa4561648c56a/1365_1124_5228_3136/1000.jpg\" alt=\"kettle ...\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Don\u2019t trust your kettle ...</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By being press-ganged into a \u201cbotnet\u201d. The devices were all vulnerable because their default passwords were known, and, worse, couldn\u2019t be changed. That made it simple for a (still unknown) hacker to write a program that would automatically log in to those devices, rewrite their software, and leave them controlled by a central server. Even more impressively, those enslaved devices then start seeking out further devices to drag into the botnet, meaning that today, if you connect a vulnerable kettle to the internet, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/we-built-a-fake-web-toaster-and-it-was-hacked-in-an-hour/505571/\">it will be hacked within an hour</a>. It doesn\u2019t need a human to do the hacking, the botnet (named \u201cMirai\u201d) just scans for new kettle and logs in using the default username and password.</p> <h2><strong>But how does that botnet take down the internet?</strong></h2> <p>Through a technique called \u201cdistributed denial of service\u201d, or DDoS. A denial of service attack involves overwhelming a particular server with requests \u2013 as though you decided to harm a small business by permanently calling their landline and refusing to hangup, so no one else could get through. But denial of service attacks are fairly easy to block, because they come from one location, and it\u2019s hard to send enough traffic from one computer to overwhelm another computer.</p> <p>A \u201cdistributed\u201d denial of service attack involves commanding networks of thousands or millions of computers \u2013 or kettles \u2013 to all send their requests at the same time. Not only can it leave the server unable to respond to real demands, it can even leave it so overwhelmed that it fails completely, crashing key services or even revealing non-public information to the world.</p> <p>The botnet that brought down parts of the internet last week was targeted at a particularly important server, which acted as the main gateway for a number of large sites including Amazon, whose AWS network itself hosts even more sites.</p> <h2><strong>Is that everything?</strong></h2> <p>Mostly, but with the proliferation of smart devices, the number of things that can be hacked is growing daily. We\u2019re connecting more and more things to the internet, and some of those things we really don\u2019t want to be hacked.</p> <p>In October 2015, for instance, security firm Rapid7 revealed vulnerabilities in a brand of insulin pump that diabetics use to control their condition. The weakness allowed an attacker to remotely trigger insulin injections, potentially leading to a fatal hypoglycaemic shock. In 2013, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/17/us-power-plants-hacking\">weaknesses were discovered</a> in power plants across the US and Canada that could cause them to overheat, shut down or malfunction if a malicious hacker decided to attack them. And as cars become more connected, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/28/car-hacking-future-self-driving-security\">hackers are going after them too</a>: researchers who discovered how to remotely disable the brakes on Jeeps in 2015 reported this year that they had found new attacks which could do even more on an unpatched vehicle.</p> <h2><strong>Can \u00a31.9bn really defend against all of that?</strong></h2> <p>It can do a lot, though not in the ways you might think. The extra money spent on staff in GCHQ and MI5, for instance, won\u2019t result in teams of spooks staring at big screens shouting things like \u201creverse the trace and send spike the server!\u201d. The money will be used, the government says, to \u201ctake the fight to those who threaten Britain in cyberspace\u201d, in part by \u201cstriking back against those that try to harm our country\u201d. It\u2019s not clear what form retaliation could take, especially when identifying the perpetrator is not straightforward. </p> <p>And \u00a31.9bn from Britain can\u2019t do everything. Experts agree that much of the response to cybercrime needs to be transnational: there\u2019s no other way to ensure, for instance, that cheap electronics made in China and sold in the UK can\u2019t be used to attack websites hosted in the US but serving the entire western hemisphere.</p> <p>Some solutions are cheap, but come with other costs. In the wake of the Mirai botnet, for instance, researchers have called for stronger regulations requiring timely security updates, and putting the cost of any damage on the manufacturer if no updates are available. That could help prevent future re-runs, but might also raise the cost of such devices.</p>",

Mum went to her doctor with a minor stomach upset and died four weeks later with an aggressive bowel tumour. She had no previous symptoms and wasn\u2019t even unwell. It came as a complete shock with total devastation to her family.</p> <p>Grief is so overpowering - it consumes you. First the numbness and autopilot mode then the heaviness of despair, then the oceans of tears, then the questions of the pointless, futility of life. Then anger, then deep despair, then numbness and repeat. Repeat. 17 months on and I still question all of it; but I cope by leaning on my loved ones and I cope by using my mum\u2019s strength to spur me on. Ironically, she is the one that gets me out of bed in the mornings. <br></p> <p>My life has changed drastically. After mum died I resigned from my job, married my partner of 22 years (we married on mum\u2019s birthday as a gift/gesture to her), I got a dog and am now planning a move with my husband to Sri Lanka for a few years. I see my life in two parts; my old life with mum and my new life; one I didn\u2019t want or choose but one that I\u2019m trying to embrace. I try to live my life as my mum wanted; with gusto and enjoying the little things. I\u2019m trying at least. <br></p> <p><em>Keely Dowton, 44-year-old teacher living in Essex</em></p> <h2>\u2018I said \u2018Good morning\u2019 to a photo of him each day\u2019<br></h2> <p>I lost my father seven years ago. It was totally unexpected and at the time I could not deal with it. I said \u2018Good morning\u2019 to a photo of him each day as I did in person before. I threw myself into planning the funeral, keeping busy meant not thinking about what had happened. <br></p> <p>Just after he passed away, I noticed a robin that would watch me when I was gardening. The robin visited the garden most days and would look towards the house. There are some people who think that symbolises that a loved one who has passed is okay. That brought me some comfort even if I don\u2019t completely believe it. I like seeing robins in the garden, even when they are being fiercely territorial. Seeing them is associated with my dad now. I talked about my dad in the present tense for a long time, maybe a year after he had died. Even now it feels incorrect to talk about him in the past because he lives on in my heart and mind. He always will. That\u2019s love. </p> <p><em>Anonymous, 39-year-old teacher living in the Midlands </em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e02b2162d3577f4a4b4c0c282535de2476777d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e02b2162d3577f4a4b4c0c282535de2476777d9/0_64_604_362/500.jpg\" alt=\"Joanne and her husband\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joanne and her husband</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joanne Baker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Dealing with death is relatively easy compared to getting on with life without them\u2019<br></h2> <p>Death means my husband. It is something I\u2019m familiar with now as I have lived through his. I lay with his dead body for half an hour and felt peace. Other people\u2019s death isn\u2019t scary for me anymore but mine is as I fear for my children. <br></p> <p>I think it\u2019s more difficult to talk about death if you haven\u2019t had any personal experience of it. A lot of the time it\u2019s very clinical, with the funeral director taking the body away fairly swiftly. There\u2019s not often the chance to spend time with the dead and say goodbye. It\u2019s almost frowned upon. I took some pictures of my husband dead; before and after he was embalmed. It doesn\u2019t feel right sharing that fact with people as I\u2019m worried they\u2019ll think it weird. It didn\u2019t feel weird to me. <br></p> <p>Even though my husband suffered with all the indignities of cancer I believe in the end he had a good death. He\u2019d put his affairs in order, planned his funeral, said goodbye to loved ones and ultimately died in my arms. If if wasn\u2019t for the fact that he was only 48 it would have been perfect. <br></p> <p>Dealing with the death was relatively easy compared to getting on with life without them. That\u2019s the hardest bit. When the funeral flowers and cards stop coming. When friends no longer bring cooked dishes round. That\u2019s when the shit hits the fan and you see the size of the hole they have left. </p> <p><em>Joanne Baker, 47-year-old full-time parent of two children living in Guiseley </em><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"48c3ea8660757f0898b02751a1511be7905a17bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48c3ea8660757f0898b02751a1511be7905a17bd/0_103_664_830/400.jpg\" alt=\"Jayne\u2019s mother\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jayne\u2019s mother</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jayne Gale</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018I gave her a bag of popping corn - she was being cremated and would have loved that!\u2019<br></h2> <p>The death of my mother last year was like watching a transition from pain to peace. I miss her so much. The horror of the last 12 hours in A&amp;E and hospital side ward as she slipped into unconsciousness will never leave my memory. The nurses were kind but no one could save her from her journey. As she took her last breaths, I told her to go find her mum now and that we would be OK. It was a privilege to share those moments but terrifying. </p> <p>I\u2019m a Christian. My mother pre-paid for a cardboard coffin, and at her request we pasted all the grandchildren\u2019s art work on it. Her lid was open and we spent an hour talking to her. Her spirit felt close. I placed momentoes in her coffin and a bag of popping corn just for fun in her hand. She was being cremated and would have loved that! </p> <p><em>Jayne Gale, 47-year-old nurse</em></p> <h2>\u2018I did not cry at the funeral, nor did I go to view his body\u2019<br></h2> <p>I experienced my dad\u2019s death at the tender age of 13, in June 2003. I did not cry at the funeral, nor did I go to view his body. I couldn\u2019t believe he was gone for good. Many times I dreamt of bumping into him on the street. I thought he would come back, even though I knew and understood that he wouldn\u2019t.</p> <p>I think most people find it hard to talk about death either due to a trauma or the death of a loved one, and in many African customs it is taboo to do so. Though it\u2019s been 13 years since my dad left I still weep as if he just died. He was my hero. I have been praying over it, and God has helped me to accept the reality, and to stop living in denial. </p> <p><em>Grace, 26-year-old living in Nairobi</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9569d3aa34cd811bb9b8d32a2860c0760ea1fc4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9569d3aa34cd811bb9b8d32a2860c0760ea1fc4f/0_377_4630_2778/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mourners attend a vigil for bus driver Manmeet Alisher at a Sikh temple in Brisbane. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mourners attend a vigil for bus driver Manmeet Alisher at a Sikh temple in Brisbane, after he was burned alive when an incendiary device was allegedly thrown at him while he was letting passengers on at Moorooka.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Peled/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018There is nothing to fear about death\u2019<br></h2> <p>I lost a little boy who was just two months old - he suddenly passed away one night unexpectedly. I did not understand how this could happen to me - not even as a punishment because I felt I had never done anything that would have deserved such a chastisement. <br></p> <p>This was when I started to try to find an answer, so I began reading about what happened after death, the meaning of life and death, why we are here on earth and so on. I got the answer after 30 years of research, so I know now why this happened to me. To me, death means to continue to live in a different form in another dimension where I will be able to meet all my dear ones who died before me and most importantly review all my past life on earth. I will then know if and how I have progressed spiritually. This will be done without judgment, just with love. Then, I will examine and decide what still has to be improved and go back to earth for another experience. </p> <p>In 2012 my mother died at the age of 84. She suffered a lot and wished she could die as soon as possible \u201cwaiting for the angels to take her\u201d. One day she had an accident at home while cooking - she was burnt and taken to hospital where she died two months later. At the very minute she died, I felt filled with an unutterable sensation of happiness which I couldn\u2019t explain at first and I understood when I was told the precise time when she died. I was so happy that she had been freed at last. My sisters got depressed and didn\u2019t understand my reaction at first, but I told them how I felt and they agreed that it was the best way to deal with our mother\u2019s death. <br></p> <p>I hope there will be more records similar to mine, so that people grow aware that there is nothing to fear about death - no judgment, no hell, no punishment - only love exists. </p> <p><em>Jean Louis, 65-year-old retired teacher living in France</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"077537da394eb4f62294c0ffee0f9ecd475dae3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/077537da394eb4f62294c0ffee0f9ecd475dae3e/98_46_730_913/400.jpg\" alt=\"Katie Shepherd\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katie</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katie Shepherd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Those who talk openly and honestly about death tend to have a more peaceful, meaningful time at the end of their life\u2019<br></h2> <p>Popular media images of death and dying often portray an image of inevitable suffering, as does frequent media coverage highlighting the inadequacies of health and social services in providing good end of life care and support. As a result, many people live in fear of death and the dying process and ultimately do not have the death they would have preferred. <br></p> <p>Problematic issues including misconceptions, unspoken anxiety, lack of control, or the loved ones of a dying person perceiving the dying process as a \u2018bad death\u2019 can all contribute towards problematic grief. My own observations of dying people and bereaved relatives are that those who have talked openly and honestly about death and dying - and who have planned for what they would like to happen when the time comes - tend to have a more peaceful, meaningful time at the end of their life. <br></p> <p><em>Katie Shepherd, 43-year-old clinical nurse specialist in palliative care, and permaculture designer living in Spain and Yorkshire</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f17c15215b3d97ba459d7aeb39739f5949450e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f17c15215b3d97ba459d7aeb39739f5949450e2/0_68_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Photo provided by Rupert Callender\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A skull on a turntable.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rupert Callender</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018I dealt with the deaths of those close to me quite badly.

I became an undertaker, something for which you need no professional qualifications almost 17 years ago after seeing Nicholas Albery of <a href=\"http://www.naturaldeath.org.uk/\">The Natural Death Centre</a> talk about a different way of approaching funerals, environmentally, socially and religiously. I had a welter of family deaths as a child, most of whose funerals I didn\u2019t go to. Now we do the opposite, encouraging as much family involvement as possible. <br></p> <p>It is entirely understandable that people find it difficult to talk about death. The implications of our own extinction and that of the Earth\u2019s are huge, particularly now we are at a stage when even the planet may die. I dealt with the deaths of those close to me quite badly. It\u2019s why I\u2019m an undertaker - do what I say, not what I do. <br></p> <p><em>Rupert Callender, ceremonial undertaker and sexton, and co owner of <a href=\"http://www.thegreenfuneralcompany.co.uk/\">The Green Funeral Company </a></em><br></p> <h2>\u2018I know that he\u2019s still present\u2019<br></h2> <p>My father\u2019s death two years ago was sudden and unexpected. The family gathered, and we supported one another. Tears, yes, but plenty of loving laughter - he had an offbeat personality in some ways with a great sense of humour, even around death: he\u2019d always said (in jest) that when he goes he wanted to be stuffed and sat in a chair so he could be glowering at people! <br></p> <p>Of course there is the awful reality of his loss in all our lives, the desperate sadness that he\u2019s not here in the physical. He genuinely hadn\u2019t an enemy in the world, and family, friends and colleagues past and present, travelled from far and wide to be at his funeral.<br> </p> <p>I know that he\u2019s still present though, with countless confirmations of that, so we still go on walks together (a shared love of nature) and we \u2018chat\u2019 daily.

My brother sent a telegram, but my employers (who had my passport in a safe) did not pass the telegram to me.

Then this summer Weiner was revealed to have had an <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3790824/Anthony-Weiner-carried-months-long-online-sexual-relationship-troubled-15-year-old-girl-telling-hard-asking-dress-school-girl-outfits-pressing-engage-rape-fantasies.html\">online relationship</a> with an allegedly underage girl, leading to the announcement of Abedin\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/nyregion/anthony-weiner-sexting-huma-abedin.html\">legal separation</a> from him in August, and in time to the current FBI investigation into his and Abedin\u2019s emails.</p> <p>Through the thick of all this, Clinton has stood by her woman. It may have had something to do with their shared experience of marital pain: Abedin first started as an intern in \u201cHillaryland\u201d, as the then first lady\u2019s coterie was called in the East Wing, in 1996, two years before President Bill Clinton was impeached for his liaison with a West Wing intern.</p> <p>Or it may be that the two women have simply grown inseparable with the passing of the years, to the extent that Abedin has variously been dubbed \u201cmini Hillary\u201d, Clinton\u2019s \u201csecond daughter\u201d and her \u201cyounger sister\u201d. From that modest beginning as a 19-year-old intern, Abedin has risen from \u201cbody woman\u201d \u2013 a glorified maid \u2013 through travelling chief of staff during Clinton\u2019s first run at the presidency in 2008, to the state department position and now vice-chair of Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.</p> <p>The union is so close that Abedin is said to carry Clinton\u2019s cellphone in her bag, prompting Bill Clinton to <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/2016/05/06/huma-abedin-hillary-clinton-anthony-weiner-453204.html\">complain</a> that even he can\u2019t get past the gatekeeper.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-fbi-director-comey-emails\">Clinton emails: FBI gets warrant as Comey told he may have broken law</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOver the years, we\u2019ve shared stories about our lives, we\u2019ve shared more meals than I can count, we\u2019ve celebrated together, we\u2019ve mourned together,\u201d Abedin told <a href=\"http://www.vogue.com/13464218/huma-abedin-family-job-hillary-clinton-campaign-strategist/\">Vogue</a> earlier this year. </p> <p>What\u2019s different about the current crisis is that though its root may have been Weiner \u2013 yet again \u2013 its danger stems directly from Abedin\u2019s own conduct rather than indirectly in her role as wronged wife.

Federal authorities in New York and North Carolina are investigating online communications between Weiner and a 15-year-old girl. </p> <p>Senior officials at the Department of Justice expressed concern that Comey\u2019s decision to inform Congress would be inconsistent with protocols designed to avoid the appearance of interference in an election. But the FBI director went ahead.</p> <h2><strong>What is in the emails?</strong></h2> <p>We don\u2019t know. Comey himself admitted: \u201cThe FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant.\u201d Those mails with a connection to Clinton\u2019s server could merely be duplicates of emails already analysed. Or they could contain a smoking gun that compromises Clinton even after the election. On Sunday, the FBI obtained a warrant to begin reviewing the newly discovered emails. The process will not be finished before election day.</p> <h2><strong>What was the reaction to Comey\u2019s announcement?</strong></h2> <p>The timing, less than two weeks before a presidential election, drew harsh criticism from Democrats and even some Republicans. At an organising event in Daytona Beach, Clinton called Comey\u2019s actions \u201cunprecedented\u201d and \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d.</p> <p>Her campaign launched an all-out war on Comey. Chairman John Podesta said: \u201cBy providing selective information, he\u2019s allowed partisans to distort and exaggerate in order to inflict maximum political damage and no one can separate what is true from what is not because Comey has not been forthcoming with the facts.\u201d </p> <p>The wider Democratic establishment also weighed in: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/democratic-senators-fbi-director-comey-clinton-emails-letter\">four senators demanded a briefing from Comey</a> and nearly 100 former Department of Justice officials and prosecutors, both Republican and Democratic and led by the former Obama attorney general Eric Holder, <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/statements/2016/10/30/open-letter-from-former-federal-prosecutors-and-high-ranking-officials-of-the-u-s-department-of-justice/\">signed a letter</a> criticising Comey\u2019s decision.</p> <p>The Trump campaign, meanwhile, was elated. \u201cWe never thought we were going to say \u2018thank you\u2019 to Anthony Weiner,\u201d the Republican presidential nominee told a rally in Nevada.</p> <h2><strong>Did Comey abuse his power?</strong></h2> <p>The nearly 100 former officials criticised his actions in their open letter, which was released by the Clinton campaign. \u201cDirector Comey\u2019s letter is inconsistent with prevailing department policy, and it breaks with longstanding practices followed by officials of both parties during past elections,\u201d they said.</p> <p>In another scathing letter to Comey, the Democratic Senate minority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, accused him of clear intent to aid one party over another. \u201cI am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act, which bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election,\u201d Reid wrote. \u201cThrough your partisan actions, you may have broken the law.\u201d</p> <p>Richard Painter, chief White House ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007, <strong>s</strong>aid he <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/opinion/on-clinton-emails-did-the-fbi-director-abuse-his-power.html?_r=0&amp;wpisrc=nl_daily202&amp;wpmm=1\">had filed a complaint</a> against the FBI for a possible violation of the Hatch Act.</p> <h2><strong>What is the Hatch Act?</strong></h2> <p>Passed in 1939, it forbids anyone in the executive branch (apart from the president or vice-president) from using his or her official position to engage in political activity. </p> <p>Carolyn Lerner, head of the US Office of Special Counsel, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/31/opinion/the-hatch-act-a-law-misused.html\">wrote in the New York Times five years ago:</a> \u201cAt its best, [the act] prevents people in political power from abusing their positions. It prohibits coercion by a government supervisor \u2013 such as pressuring employees to volunteer for or contribute to a campaign \u2013 and shields the civil service and the federal workplace from politicking.\u201d</p> <p>In July, the housing secretary, Julian Castro, was found to have <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/07/18/investigation-hud-secretary-julian-castro-broke-law-endorsing-clinton-hatch-act/87263314/\">violated</a> the Hatch Act when he expressed support for Clinton. Comey\u2019s action, however, is less blatantly partisan and a case against him would be tough to prove in court.</p> <p>The Republican congressman Trey Gowdy told Fox News on Monday: \u201cIt is laughable that Jim Comey committed a violation of the Hatch Act. I actually know what the Hatch Act is.\u201d</p> <p>Demonstrating a selective reading of the act, he continued: \u201cIf the president of the United States actively campaigning on company time for another candidate to be president of the United States is not a violation of the Hatch Act, then how is Jim Comey supplementing the record and telling the truth to Congress a violation of the Hatch Act?</p> <p>\u201cHarry Reid knows that this is not a violation.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>So why did Comey do it?</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/hillary-clinton-lose-election-fbi-email-investigation\">Will Hillary Clinton lose the US election because of the FBI email investigation?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He told FBI colleagues in a memo on Friday he was aware his letter was at risk of being misunderstood, but felt obliged to notify Congress about the new emails after having told lawmakers that the matter was closed. </p> <p>There have been reports that some members of the FBI were in revolt over Comey\u2019s earlier decision not to recommend charges against Clinton, and that he feared word of the new email investigation would leak to the media, leading to accusations of a cover-up, especially if it happened after 8 November. He therefore regarded going public now as the least worst option.</p> <h2><strong>Will these events affect the election result?</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/hillary-clinton-lose-election-fbi-email-investigation\">Possible but not probable</a>. More than 23 million people have already voted and there is little evidence of movement so far. Clinton still has a three-point lead over Trump, according to <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/clinton-emails-comey-poll-politico-morning-consult-230519\">a Politico/Morning Consult poll</a> conducted after Comey\u2019s intervention. And a CBS/YouGov survey of likely voters across 13 battleground states showed that only 1% of Clinton supporters were less likely to vote for her after the announcement. </p> <p>Her campaign said its own volunteers had been fired up and this would kill any danger of complacency. Nevertheless, Trump believes he has some fresh momentum from a saga he has described as \u201cbigger than Watergate\u201d. </p> <p>Whichever candidate is dominating the headlines tends to find their poll ratings going down. Clinton probably has enough of a cushion but the bombshell might yet affect tight races for the House and Senate.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 November 2016. An earlier version described Harry Reid as the House minority leader; he is leader of the Democrats in the Senate.</p>",

I think her presence is exacerbating the misogyny and drawing it out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"282aaf71ed565a7ea07b03c72671eb02bdf99e6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/282aaf71ed565a7ea07b03c72671eb02bdf99e6f/0_459_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women in Walnut Street in downtown Muncie, during a \u2018First Thursday\u2019 Arts Walk event.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women in Walnut Street in downtown Muncie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Since Trump's boasts of sexually assaulting women, the importance of Hillary being a woman speaks to me more</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But while African Americans, among others, overwhelmingly rallied around Obama\u2019s candidacy (delivering him <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2008/11/exit-polls-how-obama-won-015297\">96% of the black vote</a>) and celebrated the prospect of the first black president, Clinton\u2019s campaign has produced more ambivalence and less excitement among women (among whom she enjoys <a href=\"http://presidentialgenderwatch.org/polls/womens-vote-watch/presidential-polling-data/\">50% of the vote</a> ).</p> <p>In Muncie, women are divided on Clinton. The most obvious difference is partisan. Like other Trump voters, women who are voting Republican <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/oct/27/middletown-trump-muncie-clinton\">can\u2019t bear her</a>. At last week\u2019s meeting of the Citizens of Delaware County for Good Government (CDCGG), a conservative campaigning group where half of those in attendance were women, one woman asked: \u201cWhat has she ever done for women?\u201d Another replied: \u201cLook at the kind of women who are standing behind her.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>Responses to Trump\u2019s statements also broadly divide on partisan lines.\u201cThey said he was sexist because he called that beauty queen who\u2019d put on weight Miss Piggy,\u201d said one of the women at CDCGG. \u201cBut women say that kind of thing about women all the time.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to Trump\u2019s assertion that he \u201cgrabs women by the pussy,\u201d Jamie Walsh, who is in her early 30s and whose only previous presidential vote was for Obama in 2008, said: \u201cIt does bother me but personally I\u2019m not easily offended. I\u2019ve heard worse, I\u2019ve seen worse, I\u2019ve experienced worse \u2013 and all of a sudden these people haven\u2019t heard all these things before. You\u2019re kidding me. I think the outrage is overplayed for votes.\u201d </p> <p>Cathy Day, 48, an English professor at Ball State University who originally backed Bernie Sanders, says: \u201cSince Trump has started boasting about sexually assaulting women the importance of her being a woman has definitely started to speak to me more.\u201d</p> <p>But like many women here who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/oct/20/middletown-bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-muncie\">originally voted for Sanders</a>, Clinton still does not appeal to Day, who displays a sign for every other Democratic candidate in her front yard but the presidential nominee, even if she will vote for her. \u201cAs a woman it was kind of hard for me to hear some of the anti-Hillary stuff when I was campaigning for Sanders because I think a lot of it came from a place of misogyny,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd sometimes it was women saying it. But I identify as a working-class woman. My class identity is very important to me and her candidacy didn\u2019t really speak to me on that level.\u201d</p> <p>Morgan Aprill, 23, of the Progressive Student Alliance, backed Sanders and is now voting for the Green candidate, Jill Stein. \u201cI think it\u2019s extremely important that there could be a female president,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019ll be good for us too and it\u2019s about time. Of course it\u2019s emblematic. I just wish it was a different woman. I\u2019m voting for another female candidate.\u201d</p> <p>Sousa, who says she is not a \u201crabid Hillary fan\u201d herself, believes a higher bar is being set for Clinton than her male counterparts of the past. \u201cI\u2019ve met a lot of women who detest her intensely,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t take credit for this statement but I heard someone say: \u2018We\u2019ve gotten used to voting for males we don\u2019t like. We\u2019ve held our nose and we\u2019ve voted for them for whatever reason. But we aren\u2019t used to doing that with a woman.\u2019 Our culture holds women to a higher standard. </p> <p>\u201cI always thought that was an excuse not to treat women equally. It hasn\u2019t been that long since women got the vote \u2026 not even a century yet. So you couldn\u2019t find the perfect woman to run for president any more than you could find the perfect African American to be the first African-American president.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"78734a0c224ee0149a6cf955c455c8ea859e71f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78734a0c224ee0149a6cf955c455c8ea859e71f9/0_429_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Runners on the Greenway park development that follows the route of the White River through Muncie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Runners on the Greenway park development that follows the route of the White River through Muncie</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Views are also shaded quite heavily by race. Sanders won Delaware County, where Muncie resides, but Clinton won handily in Whitely, the black part of town on the east side. \u201cI\u2019m 33 years old,\u201d says Monique Armstrong, the executive director of <a href=\"http://www.motivateourminds.org/about-us/\">Motivate Our Minds</a> which is based in Whitely and offers after-school and recreational activities to children and teens.</p> <p>\u201cI remember when Hillary was first lady. I\u2019m married but I have not changed my name [as Clinton didn\u2019t initially in her career]. I\u2019m a leader in an organisation. I\u2019ve chosen to dedicate my professional life to improving the lives of children. So when I think about the things they don\u2019t like about her as a candidate they are probably the same things they don\u2019t like about me.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, there seems to be a generational divide. For younger women, who are far more likely to vote for Clinton than older women, the historical relevance of her possible election may not resonate so much.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s very hard for women who are in their 20s or 30s to understand what women in their 60s and 70s went through when they were coming up that age,\u201d explains Sousa, who several readers suggested we spoke to. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of women of my age who felt themselves passed over because they were female or were verbally harassed just in thoughtless ways rather than mean ways who do value what she has come through. Women who know that they can get into law school and medical school have a whole different perspective on our history as women.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier in the campaign season, the local LWV proposed a forum at which candidates from all the parties could explain their policies as it related to women, as they have often done in the past. The Republicans refused to participate.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at the things we raise as being of concern to our members they are consistent,\u201d says Hanson. \u201cThey\u2019ve been there for decades. They are pretty mainstream. But now those positions have been identified by some on the far right as being too far left. So the Republican party chair said the candidates didn\u2019t have to participate in our forum and that meant the Democrats couldn\u2019t either. So it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p> <p>Most women I\u2019ve spoken to in Muncie think the prospects for gender equality are improving both here and beyond, but there is still significant work to do. To that extent it is fairly typical of America.</p> <p>According to a recent poll, women think more progress has been made in overcoming sexism than racism in the past 20 years by a ratio of almost two to one. Roughly <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/us/politics/president-poll-women-hillary-clinton.html\">three-quarters of women</a> think there\u2019s some or a lot of sexual harassment in the workplace and believe women doing similar work are getting paid less than men. More than half of Americans consider Clinton a role model; less than half think she is judged more harshly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5555c224734e75c2feb17ea33ef839b5128df918\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5555c224734e75c2feb17ea33ef839b5128df918/888_518_3411_2046/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Fickle Peach on E Charles Street on the corner of Walnut Street, downtown Muncie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Fickle Peach on E Charles Street on the corner of Walnut Street, downtown Muncie</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Muncie <a href=\"http://www.thestarpress.com/story/news/local/2015/03/20/muncie-mayors-profiles-every-one-brady-tyler/25079959/\">elected its first female mayor</a>, Sharon McShurley, in 2008. McShurley served until 2012, and Hanson says women now occupy some important positions guiding the economic and cultural regeneration of the town. But there is still a long way to go. Hanson says McShurley\u2019s \u201cself-presentation was criticised in the same ways that Hillary Clinton\u2019s was \u2026 they would still talk about the way she spoke, the way she dressed, it was really sexist\u201d.</p> <p>A counsellor at the local women\u2019s shelter, who works with first offenders in spousal abuse, told Sousa that many of the men he sees haven\u2019t seen women treated with respect and that their experience is that\u2019s the way men treat women. \u201cA lot has changed,\u201d says Sousa, \u201cbut the underbelly of interpersonal relationships hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>That pause for reflection in the ballot box was important, she says, but she doesn\u2019t want to fetishise it. \u201cIt was a moment. But I don\u2019t want to make too big a deal out of it. It should just be something that happens. It\u2019s too bad it\u2019s taken so long. But I hope her being a woman doesn\u2019t become the main thing about her as she goes forward. That it\u2019s about what she\u2019s able to do.

It was in this context that South Yorkshire police were encouraged to dehumanise striking miners, to see them as violent, extremist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/03/thatcher-labour-miners-enemy-within-brighton-bomb\">\u201cenemy within\u201d</a> scum. When they violently charged at miners, lied about their behaviour with the complicity of the British media, dictated false witness statements and tried to stitch up their victims, they began a long march that ended in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/hillsborough-disaster\">the Hillsborough disaster</a> and 96 dead Liverpool fans.

Fine: it is a story repeatedly related to me by people who were actually at Orgreave and that is borne out by subsequent police testimonies, and I believe it both highlights a terrible miscarriage of justice and is revealing about how power works in this country. You may disagree, but an inquiry would have given the opportunity to settle the issue. And, yes, Labour should have initiated its own when it was in office, although it was its belated decision to launch the Hillsborough inquiry that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/16/orgreave-inquiry-calls-grow-after-damning-hillsborough-verdict-for-south-yorkshire-police\">fuelled demands for justice for Orgreave</a>.

South Yorkshire police were violent, ideologically driven and corrupt. But they were not stupid. They behaved as they did because they believed they had official sanction to do so. They then learned a lesson \u2013 quite reasonably \u2013 that they could act with impunity. Counterfactual history is a mug\u2019s game, and it would be wrong to state with total certainty that Hillsborough would never have happened if the police had been held to account after Orgreave. But it is beyond question that their subsequent behaviour was uncannily similar: treating their working-class victims as scum, lying in concert with the British media, falsifying witness statements, covering up what they did. And this time people did die \u2013 in their dozens.</p> <p>Imagine if a Labour government had ruled Britain in the 1980s, deliberately run down the financial sector, and sent police officers rampaging through the Home Counties to beat up City workers fighting for their jobs and communities. The truth is the Tories are soaked in triumphalism. They transformed Britain in the 1980s, they are proud of it \u2013 fine \u2013 and they have no interest in exposing the ugly deeds committed in the process. As <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/31/amber-rudd-praised-for-resisting-calls-for-battle-of-orgreave-in/\">Norman Tebbit puts it</a>, \u201can inquiry could have been used as a stick with which to beat the Thatcher government\u201d. That\u2019s what this is really about: not justice, but defending the reputation of a Conservative party that was content to subvert the rule of law if that was what it took. To paraphrase George Bernard Shaw, one side preaches the class war, the other practises it. But Theresa May\u2019s government should be warned. Those driven by justice tend to be persistent \u2013 and history judges them rather more kindly than those who obstruct them.</p>",

Plucked out of thin air, with no coherent vision, as she tries to distance herself from David Cameron, by junking all her predecessor\u2019s plans and policies. </p> <h2>Micromanagement</h2> <p>Meanwhile, local authorities are being left to pick up the pieces amid mounting concern about how school improvement services are going to be funded.</p> <p>The new education secretary, Justine Greening must have been one of the many people shocked by last week\u2019s announcement. After all, barely a month ago, she told the education select committee that the white paper was moving forward. Then an about-turn this week.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/sep/03/secret-teacher-schools-are-in-crisis-parents-we-need-your-help\">Secret Teacher: schools are in crisis \u2013 parents, we need your help</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The prime minister earned a reputation for micromanagement at the Home Office. Perhaps she has yet to learn that it is simply not a sustainable way to operate in her new role.</p> <p>Constant changes to policy, hesitation and delays appear to be coupled with foisting a series of Downing Street initiatives on unenthusiastic Whitehall departments. It suggests that the prime minister feels that she can run the whole of Whitehall from her office. But if that approach kept her in the Home Office for six years, it will only lead to disaster in Downing Street, as she continues to dither, delay, and reverse positions on every issue facing our country. </p> <p>In the meantime, any plans for new grammar schools will now have to be put to a vote in the House of Commons. I look forward to challenging Theresa May\u2019s arguments, with the support of a substantial weight of expert opinion and evidence against her regressive plans.</p> <p>And from the conversations I have already had with MPs on both sides of the house, I believe it is a vote we can win.</p> <p><strong>Follow us on Twitter via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianTeach\">@GuardianTeach</a>.

My friends would visit and comment on how the home was \u201cposh\u201d. </p> <p>I began to understand then that perceptions of class identity in Britain could change quickly based on a number of factors. The council estate that I walked through and the other housing developments near my large, concrete block comprehensive school gave me the impression that I was perhaps part of this different \u201cmiddle class\u201d that my grandmother in particular aspired to.

Staffed by just one nurse, according to deposition testimony, the queues were so long many inmates gave up before receiving any attention. Between three to five nurses worked in the prison on each shift. Nurses estimated that they would see 400-500 patients a month.</p> <p>Medical records and depositions show that Jaramillo was seen first on 8 May and then again on 11 May, and finally on the morning of 22 May.

During a 2012 deposition hearing, the prison\u2019s long-serving nurse practitioner, June Kershner, told Curtis that once again the prison had no physician on staff, leaving the facility dangerously under-resourced. Inmates and staff now referred to her as \u201cdoctor\u201d despite her lack of qualifications, and medication was prescribed by an Arizona-based doctor over the telephone.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/federal-officials-ignored-years-of-internal-warnings-about-deaths-at-private-prisons/\">An investigation by the Nation magazine</a> found that the Cibola County facility accumulated more repeat deficiencies or significant flaws in health provision than any other private federal prison, with 30 out of 34 contract citations since 2007 related to poor standards of medical care. The investigation also identified three deaths, not including Jaramillo\u2019s, linked to questionable care at the facility by the end of 2015.</p> <p>These failures, argued experts, made Ice\u2019s decision to keep the facility open all the more extraordinary, particularly when the Department of Homeland Security is conducting its own review of its use of privatised institutions, following the DoJ announcement in August.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just stunning that Ice is turning around and signing a new contract there,\u201d said Carl Takei, a staff attorney at the ACLU\u2019s national prison project. \u201cWe have serious concerns about the medical care for Ice detainees being just as terrible as it was for BOP prisoners. There\u2019s no reason to believe it will improve. It\u2019s the same company and the same facility.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, CCA chief executives formally announced the five-year contract with Ice, arguing: \u201cCCA already has an experienced, well-trained workforce at the Cibola County corrections center which, for many years, has provided an exceptional level of service to the BOP, and we are proud to have the opportunity to extend the same level of exceptional service to another federal customer under this new contract.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>The village of Milan, with a population of just 1,300, was caught off guard when the DoJ announced the closure earlier in the summer. CCA is the largest employer here, and also in the neighboring town of Grants, where the company operates a <a href=\"https://www.abqjournal.com/144121/former-inmate-testifies-about-sexual-assault.html\">controversial</a> women\u2019s prison under a contract with the state government.</p> <p>There were 245 jobs scheduled to be lost by the time the Cibola County prison was due to close, at the end of October. The village stood to lose a projected $358,000 in revenue from property taxes and gross receipts, while the county government would have lost $700,000 annually in taxes.</p> <p>Families had already begun packing up and leaving town in September, as local government officials frantically pushed for solutions and endorsed CCA efforts to keep the prison open as it sought contracts with Ice, the US marshal service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</p> <p>\u201cIt will turn this community into a ghost town,\u201d said Marcella Sandoval, the Milan village manager in September. \u201cThe prison is a lifeline for us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90dfff5e256e91cdaab0f076cf443443da11e3c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90dfff5e256e91cdaab0f076cf443443da11e3c0/0_64_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marcella Sandoval and Eileen Yarborough\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcella Sandoval and Eileen Yarborough, executive director of Cibola Communities Economic Development Foudation.

It was around this time that CCA bought facilities in the area, offering a chance of employment to those who remained in town.</p> <p>The prison drew almost instant controversy. In 2001, inmates rioted over the quality of food, drawing local police and outside law enforcement who used teargas to quell the unrest. But residents soon grew used to the prison\u2019s presence. Many who spoke to the Guardian in September felt slighted by the federal government\u2019s decision to close the prison. In this heavily Democratic county, some said the decision had been enough to make them vote Republican at the election in November. Sandoval said the county was given no advanced warning and no assistance was offered to the local economy. </p> <p>Milan\u2019s police chief, Jerry Stephens, who commands the village\u2019s seven-strong police department, said just two escapes had occurred from the prison during his tenure as chief.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the community here worries about it at all,\u201d he said. A records request indicated his department had attended 49 assault calls at the prison between 2014 and 2015. </p> <p>Despite this, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/private-federal-prisons-more-dangerous-justice-department\">Department of Justice\u2019s inspector general found</a> that inmates in its contract prisons were nine times more likely to be placed on lockdown than in other comparable facilities, and assault rates were 28% higher than in federal prisons.</p> <p>In an interview in October, Sandoval told the Guardian that the reopened facility could now eventually hold 1,400 detainees \u2013 expanding its already stretched capacity by 200 beds. \u201cThe decision basically saved us. They\u2019re rehiring and will have even more jobs this time,\u201d she said, relieved. </p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>Jose Jaramillo wrote a short statement after he was arrested for illegal re-entry in August 2006: \u201cI know what I did is against the law and so I accept full responsibility for my conduct. I came back to work and be with my family.\u201d</p> <p>Jaramillo had been pulled over as he drove from the chilli fields outside of Roswell, where he had worked backbreaking shifts for most of his life, starting at 5am and finishing at sunset. A sheriff\u2019s deputy had noticed he had a broken headlight, and later reported him to border patrol agents in New Mexico after he failed to present identification papers. Instead of running away when agents called to inform him he was likely to be arrested, he waited for them to arrive at the door that evening.</p> <p>\u201cI think that just shows you what sort of a law-abiding guy he was,\u201d Lisa Curtis said.</p> <p>That year over <a href=\"http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/356/\">29,000 people were convicted for illegal entry and re-entry</a>. By 2013, that number had soared to just under 88,000 \u2013 meaning more than half of all federal criminal prosecutions that year were for unlawful border crossings. By the time the DoJ announced it was abandoning all contracts with these 13 private immigrant jails, their populations had swelled to 22,000 inmates, costing the federal government $600m a year.</p> <p>After he stabilized in 2009, Jaramillo was moved to the nursing home in Las Cruces. The federal government had initially moved to deport him, but the family successfully appealed after arguing he would die within days if he was moved back to Mexico. But the brain damage was irreparable. He had no movement from the neck down. When he spoke it was often nonsensical. On rare occasions when he could muster a coherent sentence, he told his daughter Judy, born in the US with full citizenship, that he wanted her to finish high school and become a nurse.</p> <p>\u201cIt was his dream,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Judy is now training to become an elementary school teacher, but visited her father twice a week at the nursing home until his death in July. The family, who settled with CCA in 2014 for an undisclosed amount with no admission of liability, placed the money in a trust to pay for Jaramillo\u2019s care, but knew the end was coming as his health rapidly deteriorated from another infection.</p> <p>\u201cI just felt like the world was hitting me,\u201d Judy said of the day her father died. \u201cIt was sadness and anger. Anger at the prison.\u201d</p>",

However, when it comes to the solutions, whether it is politicians, sharia councils or secular activists, everyone seems to think they know what is best for Muslim women.</p> <p>However it is essential that Muslim women are at the forefront of informing the solutions that work for them. Their voices can already be heard in the most comprehensive <a href=\"http://www.mwnuk.co.uk/resourcesDetail.php?id=156\" title=\"\">report on Muslim marriage and divorce in Britain</a>, which we at the <a href=\"http://www.mwnuk.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Muslim Women\u2019s Network UK</a> published earlier this year. The report provides information on the challenges Muslim women face and what steps they can take to protect their rights, including recommendations on how sharia councils can raise their standards and what the government can do to strengthen civil law.</p> <p>Muslim women also want to inform the debate when it comes to solutions. We are so fed up of being used as a political football that, in an unprecedented move, more than 100 Muslim women from across the religious spectrum from 34 towns and cities, and from different professions ranging from lawyers, academics, health professionals, community activists to students and homemakers, have signed an <a href=\"http://www.mwnuk.co.uk/mediaStatmentDetail.php?id=172\" title=\"\">open letter</a>. Two-thirds of the signatories know someone, be it a family member, friend or client, who has used a sharia divorce service; 25% have used one themselves and others want the option, should they ever need it. Despite the sometimes traumatic experience of being questioned by male scholars about their domestic abuse, most Muslim women do not want these sharia services to be abolished. I know this is not what many people want to hear because it does not suit their political agendas. In fact, Muslim women are alarmed that some feminists are pushing their own anti-faith or anti-Islam agendas through the guise of women\u2019s rights. They view Islam in a reductionist manner, regarding all faith practices as discriminatory and conflating misogyny and patriarchy with religious fundamentalism and extremism.</p> <p>Human rights do not only have to be discussed in secular terms, they can also be addressed within the framework of religion. Muslim feminists here and abroad have long been promoting enlightened interpretations of Islam that are compatible with democracy, human rights, freedom and pluralism. So those who advocate the immediate shutting down of sharia councils are no friends, because this would result in Muslim women being trapped in abusive marriages and drive sharia divorce services underground, leading to even less transparency, higher fees and more discrimination.</p> <p>This does not mean Muslim women support sharia councils that claim that discrimination does not take place by pointing to the positive experiences of women while disregarding those who are subjected to unfair practices. They have had long enough to self-regulate and raise standards but have not done so. We continue to receive complaints about their services on the Muslim Women\u2019s Network helpline.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jun/27/mps-launch-inquiry-sharia-law-courts-uk\">MPs launch inquiry into sharia courts in UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So what do Muslim women want? They want the government and religious authorities (whether they are mosques, sharia councils or individual scholars) to take measures to eliminate discrimination against women in all matters relating to marriage and divorce. For religious authorities this means practising the many provisions in Islam that allow women to obtain a religious divorce quickly, without duress and discrimination. Remedial action must include recognising civil divorce as an Islamic divorce and not putting Muslim women through the trauma of another process to make money or to assert authority and maintain relevance in Muslim communities.</p> <p>The government also needs to step in and ensure that sharia divorce services raise their standards while strengthening civil law. Changes could include making a civil marriage compulsory prior to a religious marriage, as not all Muslim women are in legally recognised marriages. In most cases a civil divorce can then be recognised as an Islamic divorce. Making a civil marriage compulsory could also reduce and eventually eliminate polygamy. The Divorce (Religious Marriages) Act 2002 could be amended so that it includes Muslim women as it currently only applies to Jewish women. This would remedy the unbalanced bargaining power of the husband in some divorce cases where there is pressure to agree to unfair custodial and financial demands during the civil divorce in return for not contesting a religious divorce. The judge would be able to withhold finalising the civil divorce until the woman receives her religious divorce from the husband.</p> <p>If these solutions are implemented, Muslim women will increasingly use the British justice system at their own pace for divorce and become less reliant on sharia councils, making most of them naturally redundant in the future anyway.</p>",

But if the demands of the DC universe make a minimalistic caped crusader an unlikely prospect any time soon, Affleck\u2019s brother Casey might have just the tonic. <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/film/news/casey-affleck-villain-vigilante-thriller-1201903512/\">Variety reports that the younger sibling is pitching a new thriller titled Villain</a>, which will focus on a Batman-style vigilante who gains superpowers after being shot in the head during a brutal burglary. Intriguingly, this new \u201creal-world\u201d superhero sounds a lot like Affleck\u2019s raging, murderous dark knight in Dawn of Justice. Is the younger Affleck satirising his own brother\u2019s work? To quote the trade bible:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The movie is set in a city overrun with crime. Affleck\u2019s character loses everything of meaning in his life when a brutal home invasion leaves his family dead and two bullets lodged in his head. He develops a unique power in the wake of his trauma \u2014 an ability to see into people\u2019s pasts, presents, and futures \u2014 and goes on a mission of revenge to find the men who killed his family, and in the process clean up his city long overdue for justice.</p> <p>But as his vigilante acts become more frequent and violent in nature, his arrival as the city\u2019s hero may instead be the announcement of its most prolific villain.</p> </blockquote> <p>As the superhero genre continues to gain in popularity, it was perhaps inevitable that we would see comic book tropes beginning to seep into other genres. What are the heroes and villains of Josh Trank\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/02/chronicle-film-review\">Chronicle</a>, Neil Burger\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/27/limitless-bradley-cooper-review\">Limitless</a> or Luc Besson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/21/lucy-scarlett-johansson-luc-besson-review\">Lucy</a> experiencing, after all, if not a form of superpower?

Dugas was not named in early research, and is still not named in the Nature<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature19827.html\"> study</a> - but he was outed and demonized in Randy Shilts\u2019s 1987 book And the Band Played On.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/26/patient-zero-gaetan-dugas-not-source-of-hivaids-outbreak-study-proves\">Ga\u00e9tan Dugas: 'patient zero' not source of HIV/Aids outbreak, study confirms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This \u201cnews\u201d was met largely with a collective yawn by many people I know who, like me, study Aids for a living. After all, Patient Zero\u2019s importance has long been downplayed by scientists, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature19827.html\">recognized as</a> \u201cneither the first Aids case to come to CDC researchers\u2019 attention, nor the first to display symptoms.\u201d And while Nature notes the <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature19827.html\">origins of HIV/Aids</a> \u201cremain contentious\u201d amongst serious scholars, \u201cand the earliest movements of the virus within the US are unknown,\u201d Shilt\u2019s account has never been taken too seriously by them.</p> <p>And the Band Played On \u2013 a work of book-length journalism written as the Aids epidemic was unfolding in the United States \u2013 was not a work that examined events after time had passed. Since Shilts\u2019s death (itself related to Aids), his overwrought emphasis on Dugas has been widely criticized by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bu.edu/today/2015/anthony-petro-after-the-wrath-of-god/\">Aids historians</a>, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=kZOso0FMsrMC&amp;q=and+the+band+played+on#v=snippet&amp;q=and%20the%20band%20played%20on&amp;f=false\">social scientists</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4046389/\">public health researchers</a> \u2013 particularly for framing \u201cthe epidemiological spread of the epidemic as very much a <em tabindex=\"-1\">moral</em> failing on the part of this flight attendant,\u201d as scholar <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bu.edu/today/2015/anthony-petro-after-the-wrath-of-god/\">Anthony Petro puts it</a>. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Indeed, those of us who study Aids have long known that long before common symptoms such as Kaposi sarcoma and pneumonia were showing up among hemophiliacs and gay men, they were likely affecting homeless people who lived off society\u2019s radar, people who used IV drugs and those who avoided medical treatment out of fear. As activist Betty Williams told the<a href=\"http://www.actuporalhistory.org/interviews/images/bwilliams.pdf\"> Act up Oral History project</a> in 2008: \u201cI actually believe that Aids kind of existed among this group of people first, because if you look back, there was something called junkie pneumonia, there was something called the dwindles that addicts got, and I think this was another early Aids population way too helpless to ever do anything for themselves on their own behalf.\u201d</p> <p>What is newsworthy about the Nature study is that, by \u201cjackhammering\u201d the decaying RNA of decades-old blood samples, epidemiologists have proven that the strain of HIV Dugas had was already circulating before he was a carrier. The Times article also <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/27/health/hiv-patient-zero-genetic-analysis.html?_r=0\">poetically points out</a> an irony: Dugas was never supposed to be known as Patient Zero, but as Patient Letter O, for \u201coutside southern California\u201d.</p> <p>So why, then, did the myth of Patient Zero live on for so long? Why was he, or anyone, scapegoated in the first place?</p> <p>Both happened because we like to blame individuals (especially queer folks, women, immigrants and people of color) for diseases, particularly communicable ones that involve sex. Societally, it is far easier to blame them for disease rather than to deal with the complex medical, political and epidemiological causes \u2013 just as it has been easier to unfairly malign Dugas all these years.</p> <p>In white America\u2019s long, ableist history of considering itself well unless made unwell by those it considers <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/3560422/Technologies_of_Blood_Asylum_Medicine_and_Biopolitics\">sick outsiders</a>, Dugas was just one of many individually maligned as pariahs. </p> <p>They include <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Typhoid-Mary-Captive-Publics-Health/dp/0807021032\">\u201cTyphoid\u201d Mary Mallon</a>, an Irish immigrant blamed for typhoid transmission and kept in isolation for 26 years on an island in New York City; <a href=\"https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/notorious-h-i-v\">Nushawn Williams</a>, convicted for transmitting HIV to nine young women and \u2013 despite having long ago finished his sentence \u2013 kept in<a href=\"https://www.poz.com/article/hivpositive-convict-nushawn-williams-remain-civil-confinement\"> \u201ccivil confinement\u201d indefinitely</a>; and <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/steventhrasher/a-black-body-on-trial-the-conviction-of-hiv-positive-tiger-m?utm_term=.dyLKjPy6e6#.tul8rPXOJO\">Michael \u201cTiger Mandingo\u201d Johnson</a> (whom I have covered at length and is the subject of my doctoral dissertation), who was convicted of four people to HIV and transmitting the virus to one person despite there being no RNA evidence used to even see if Johnson and his sex partner shared the same strain of HIV. (Johnson is serving a 30-year prison sentence in Missouri, often in solitary confinement, in a state where the average sentence for second-degree murder is only<a href=\"https://doc.mo.gov/Documents/publications/Offender%20Profile%20FY14.pdf\"> 25 years</a>.)</p> <p>But while blaming diseases on individuals \u2013 or even criminalizing them, as people with HIV are in more than <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/policies/law/states/exposure.html\">30 US states</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hivjustice.net/news/new-report-shows-hiv-criminalisation-is-growing-global-problem-but-advocates-are-fighting-back/\">70 countries</a> \u2013 may make well people feel weirdly superior, it doesn\u2019t do much about curing or curtailing the transmission of communicable diseases. <a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/hiv/en/\">According to</a> the World Health Organization, Aids has killed about 35 million people, and about 37 million people are currently living with HIV globally. Threatening them for living with such a treatable disease only increases its stigma, forcing them into the shadows and decreasing the likelihood that others at risk will get tested.<br></p> <p>We would do well to look at the Nature study\u2019s new timeline and ponder if HIV was circulating among IV drug users in the early 1970s. Many such people avoided healthcare settings which they (rightly) believed could be punitive \u2013 which could have aided HIV\u2019s transmission. We as a society are in part to blame, then, for creating the condition in which the epidemic could take hold \u2013 just as we are now responsible for allowing punitive laws that specifically target HIV to continue letting it flourish. </p> <p>It\u2019s also worth noting that societies begin to understand that a disease exists and is worthy of treatment only when it begins to affect people (or animals) whose lives the society values. When Aids was only affecting homeless people and IV drug users in the US, there was not a critical mass of care about them to make it register. Aids began to come into some focus when it affected homosexual men, not because gay men\u2019s lives were valued by US society at large (they weren\u2019t), but because amongst them were some powerful, often closeted, white gay men who were raised to believe their bodies were important and infallible. </p> <p>When they believed that their bodies were unfairly giving out on them (and threatening to out them), these men \u2013 along with out lesbians and gay men and transgender people of all races \u2013 did something about it, founding groups like <a href=\"http://gmhc.org/\">Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis</a> and <a href=\"http://www.actupny.org/\">Act-up</a>. They applied so much pressure that scientific and political communities had to verify that Aids existed.<br></p> <p>Hastening this process was news that hemophiliacs and others receiving blood and organ transfusions were affected. These people \u2013 particularly children like Ryan White \u2013 were considered \u201cinnocent\u201d and worthy of protecting from the disease, unlike homosexuals like Dugas who were considered guilty for getting it and for giving it to others.</p> <p>Since the disease wasn\u2019t given public attention until it infected those with societal clout, is it ever right to out one believed to be \u201cPatient Zero\u201d? As a journalist, I understand the desire to do so to tell a story. Times story author Donald G McNeil Jr <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/sunday-review/the-ethics-of-hunting-down-patient-zero.html?_r=0\">defends</a> the practice epidemiologically, saying stopping such people is important in stopping epidemics. But he uses the term \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d, which sounds too much like \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/25/hillary-clinton-race-crime-justice-reform\">super-predators</a>\u201d and is too pejorative for my taste, with both terms overburdening the individual rather than the conditions they inhabit.</p> <p>In her new book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Conflict-Not-Abuse-Overstating-Responsibility/dp/1551526433\">Conflict Is Not Abuse</a>, novelist and Aids historian Sarah Schulman writes about how the transmission of HIV to millions worldwide is a normative human experience unworthy of criminalization or stigma. Dugas was innocent not just because RNA now says so, but because <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/10002442/Statement_of_Ownership_An_Autethnography_of_Living_with_HIV\">all people who live with HIV or who die of Aids are innocent</a>. </p> <p>Let\u2019s allow Dugas\u2019s most recent exoneration to be his final one, and let\u2019s take this chance to retire the idea of the HIV/Aids scapegoat. Let\u2019s stop the shame and blame, so that we may move on the challenge of tackling the real, treatable and preventable ways HIV is transmitted.</p>",

Almost three-quarters translates as millions of disabled voters possibly being denied their vote.</p> <p>The report also says stigma is a huge problem, especially for people with learning and mental disabilities. According to research, in <a href=\"http://www.bazelon.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=1kgFTxMFHZE%3D&amp;tabid=315\">27 US states</a> large numbers of people in these groups are barred from or have <a href=\"http://disabilityjustice.org/right-to-vote\">restrictions placed on voting</a>.</p> <p>It might be tempting to think of voting access for people with disabilities as a predominantly US problem but as the last UK general election showed, it is far from alone.

None of these problems, be they in Britain or the US, are universal or irreversible. During the 2016 presidential campaign it has been encouraging to see positive perspectives on disability.

But the nuclear lab remains, and the city is still an island in many ways: an extraordinary pocket of wealth and privilege, surrounded by some of the poorest counties in New Mexico, one of the poorest states in America.</p> <p>The city is also partly toxic.

During the second world war, Los Alamos was the site of a classified research laboratory, built as part of the Manhattan Project to develop an atomic bomb. Along with Oak Ridge, Tennessee and Hanford, Washington, it was also home to a \u201csecret city\u201d built to house thousands of scientists, engineers and their families.</p> <p>\u201cIt was isolated, and it was also beautiful, which was something [J Robert] Oppenheimer used when he recruited people,\u201d says Jon Hunner, professor of history at New Mexico State University, referring to the theoretical physicist who led the Los Alamos lab.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"508271c0621dec7c18f96a31e54238b1b0da4ec1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/508271c0621dec7c18f96a31e54238b1b0da4ec1/0_161_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Los Alamos / Espanola, New Mexico for cities\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Los Alamos\u2019s once secret nuclear history has become a tourist attraction.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brooks Saucedo-McQuade</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The goal, he explains, had been to build top secret, temporary research facilities in order to keep US nuclear scientists and their work \u201caway from prying eyes and ears\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Those who lived in Los Alamos were forbidden to talk about it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hunner\u2019s 2007 book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Inventing-Los-Alamos-Growth-Community/dp/0806138912\">Inventing Los Alamos</a>, describes the birth of what he calls an \u201cinstant city\u201d.

And, officially, the town did not exist. </p> <p>Those who lived in Los Alamos were forbidden to talk about it. The town was not mentioned on drivers licenses, birth certificates, or postal mail. The whole area was surrounded by fences, gates and guards.</p> <p>Constructed almost overnight, much of the land was simply appropriated from traditional Hispanic homesteaders and Native American communities, as well as an elite <a href=\"http://www.losalamoshistory.org/ranch_school.htm\">private boys school</a> that counted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/14/gore-vidal-gripped-a-nation\">Gore Vidal</a> as one of its famous alumni. </p> <p>To guard its secret, Los Alamos was built to be almost completely self-contained. There were schools, a hospital, and theatres that doubled as dance halls on Saturdays and churches on Sundays. Housing was allocated according to one\u2019s rank at the lab. By the end of the war, it had a population of 6,000.</p> <p>\u201cEverything was run by the Army Corps of Engineers. There were no private businesses in Los Alamos until the 1950s. Nobody could own property. Nobody could own their home,\u201d says Hunner. With its focus on the science behind the bomb, he describes it \u201clike a university town that was controlled by the military\u201d.</p> <p>It was also shoddily constructed, he says, because it was only supposed to exist during the second world war.

Some of the biggest numbers are from Russia, Germany and Japan.</p> <p>McClenahan says Los Alamos has \u201calways been conflicted\u201d about the impact of the research done here. From the beginning, she says, \u201cthere were scientists who were so proud of not only the scientific work they did, but of saying \u2018We ended world war two\u2019. And then there were others who said, \u2018We just killed hundreds of thousands of people\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>For decades, she adds, there was also \u201ca sense of \u2018Stay out of our town, we\u2019re doing top-secret work and you can\u2019t come here\u2019.\u201d But attitudes have changed. Now, she says, people are thinking: \u201cHow do we bring tourists to our tiny little town?\u201d</p> <h2>Espa\u00f1ola: \u2018It\u2019s complicated\u2019</h2> <p>Espa\u00f1ola is a 25 minute drive north-east of Los Alamos. It, too, is a small town, with a population of about 10,000. But, in many respects, it feels a world away from the nuclear island on the hill.</p> <p>The road into Espa\u00f1ola passes by brightly painted murals and drive-thru fast food restaurants. Other buildings bear hand-painted signs on storefronts, selling animal feed, boots and party supplies for <em>quincea\u00f1eras</em>. Boldly coloured low-rider cars, which have become key cultural symbols of this part of New Mexico, rumble down the town\u2019s wide roads.</p> <p>Sheehey, the Los Alamos councillor, says that thousands of people commute to Los Alamos each day from neighbouring communities like this one. \u201cEconomic benefit is felt throughout the region,\u201d he says. \u201cChildren from outside the county are allowed to attend Los Alamos schools, which still get a federal subsidy and are some of the best public schools in New Mexico.\u201d</p> <p>The lab has also been \u201cgenerous in supporting education and other community programs in Espa\u00f1ola and other neighbouring communities,\u201d Sheehey adds. He gives the example of a free bus service through northern New Mexico, funded partly by a Los Alamos county program called Progress through Partnering.</p> <p>Like many people in Espa\u00f1ola, Patricia Trujillo, 39, says she has always been connected to the lab in some way. \u201cWhen we talk about the company town it\u2019s much wider than Los Alamos,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the whole valley.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c2ea2498b95f4e9cbf2f266ffae89aa3dc8cb415\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2ea2498b95f4e9cbf2f266ffae89aa3dc8cb415/0_227_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Los Alamos / Espanola, New Mexico for cities\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two towns divided by extreme wealth and inequality.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brooks Saucedo-McQuade</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a child in the late 1980s, Trujillo says she remembers her teachers sending her and her classmates to wait by the side of the road and cheer as new scientific equipment was brought to Los Alamos by truck. \u201cThey had us sit outside all day long,\u201d she says. \u201cInstead of getting us to question it, they had us cheering.\u201d</p> <p>Her own grandmother worked in Los Alamos in the 1940s, as a house matron in charge of a dormitory for other women who worked in the then-secret city\u2019s households and offices. And Trujillo herself has worked at the lab, including as a technical writer after university.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The lab\u2019s location was chosen for its secrecy, not its safety</p> <footer> <cite>Beata Tsosie Pe\u00f1a</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are small businesses in Espa\u00f1ola, she says that have also benefited from subcontracts to provide supplies for the lab.</p> <p>But the word Trujillo chooses to describe Espa\u00f1ola\u2019s relationship with Los Alamos is \u201ccomplicated\u201d.</p> <p>Now professor of literature and Chicano studies at Northern New Mexico College in Espa\u00f1ola, and head of the school\u2019s equity and diversity program, she explains: \u201cA lot of our middle class, our wealthier parents, will drive their kids to Los Alamos county every day, to send them to school there. But then we lose that parent base here.\u201d</p> <p>Trujillo says Los Alamos has supported projects including those to write science curriculum for schools in Espa\u00f1ola. But these efforts have been \u201cpiecemeal\u201d and \u201cproblematic,\u201d she says, doing little to address structural inequalities between the two communities.</p> <p>There is instead a pervasive \u201chill-valley disparity\u201d, Trujillo argues, which impacts imaginations and limits people\u2019s aspirations. The \u201cmajority of manual labourers come from the Espa\u00f1ola valley ... but there\u2019s no trickle down,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a multibillion dollar industry, but unfortunately there\u2019s a lot of inequity.\u201d<br></p> <h2>Secrecy, not safety</h2> <p>In Espa\u00f1ola\u2019s Valdez Park, Beata Tsosie Pe\u00f1a, 38, is sitting with her young son near a freshly terraced slope where she will soon help plant trees as part of a new community garden.</p> <p>Pe\u00f1a was born in the nearby Santa Clara pueblo, and is coordinator of the environmental justice programme at Tewa Women United (TWU), a civil society organisation led by indigenous women in the area (Tewa is the name of a native language group). Trujillo is also on the board of TWU.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jul/20/graveyard-earth-inside-city-40-ozersk-russia-deadly-secret-nuclear\">'The graveyard of the Earth': inside City 40, Russia's deadly nuclear secret</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pe\u00f1a describes the Los Alamos lab as intertwined with issues of power and injustice from the very beginning. Much of the land for the lab was taken from Native communities in the 1940s, in what she says started with temporary agreements, and understandings that it would be returned after the war.</p> <p>\u201cLos Alamos is on all these sacred sites, ancestral sites. We knew not to develop there, to build there. We would never have done that, because we were put there as caretakers of the water and the land,\u201d she said.</p> <p>There are also concerns about the lab\u2019s environmental impact on neighbouring communities. Pe\u00f1a\u2019s organisation is part of the<a href=\"http://ccwnewmexico.org/\"> Communities for Clean Water coalition</a> created to monitor Los Alamos\u2019s impact on water for \u201cdrinking, agriculture, sacred ceremonies, and a sustainable future\u201d.</p> <p>The September 2016 report on nuclear waste came from the the lab\u2019s own environmental management office. The 20-plus years and $4bn clean-up costs were criticised \u2013 for being likely underestimates.</p> <p>\u201cThe [lab\u2019s] location was chosen for its secrecy, not its safety. And now there\u2019s so much money, it\u2019s seen as an investment they don\u2019t want to lose,\u201d says Pe\u00f1a, wondering aloud how many of Los Alamos\u2019s residents \u201cknow on whose land they are, and that the privilege of living here comes with responsibility\u201d.</p> <p>But, again, the word she chooses is \u201ccomplicated\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere needs to be a transition to a different mission [for the lab], to things like clean-up technologies, alternative energy, green energy,\u201d she argues. \u201cProtest groups come here and say \u2018Shut it down\u2019.

And they like a legacy.</p> <p>Theresa May is different from past prime ministers in many ways, but it seems she shares with her predecessors a penchant for big projects, even in the face of overwhelming evidence against them. In just a few months she has pushed a vote to renew <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident\" title=\"\">Trident</a>, given the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/theresa-may-accused-backing-down-hinkley-point-c-deal\" title=\"\">go-ahead to Hinkley Point C</a> and pledged her government\u2019s support for the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/heathrow-airport-expansion-gets-government-approval-gatwick\" title=\"\"> expansion of Britain\u2019s busiest airport</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/heathrow-airport-expansion-gets-government-approval-gatwick\">Heathrow airport expansion gets government approval</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Taken separately these decisions are big. Together they tell us about the kind of Britain this government is trying to build, literally as well as metaphorically: a country ill-equipped for the future and that won\u2019t meet its own needs; a nation whose presence on the world stage will be defined by its ability to kill millions; a Britain failing to make the economic transition necessary to free itself from the worst effects of climate change. Communities that get the illusion of control, provided they make the decisions people in power want.</p> <p>The choices we\u2019re offered say just as much about the Westminster\u2019s mindset as the final outcomes. Do we want Heathrow or Gatwick? Nuclear power or gas? Safety provided by nuclear weapons or the danger of losing them? We weren\u2019t offered no new runways or a truly decentralised, community-owned energy system. The government didn\u2019t ask whether we want the security of not transporting nuclear weapons across our country. And, without a coherent official opposition on these issues, genuine debate about these alternatives is dangerously narrowed.</p> <p>It\u2019s striking that support for these mega-projects hasn\u2019t only come from the Conservatives and their friends in big business. The Labour party and the trade unions are backing them, too. An old-school consensus has emerged which sees everyone from Unite to the CBI competing over who can shout loudest about the benefits of building big things. Never mind the better choices buried in the process. But the truth is we do not live in an economy with only binary options.</p> <p>The government could have chosen not to support Heathrow \u2013 and instead followed the climate science to its logical conclusion and pledged action to tackle the surging demand for flying from the super rich. They know that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/20/frequent-flyer-tax-leisure-airfares\" title=\"\">70% of flights are taken by just 15% of people</a> \u2013 and that a simple tax on frequent flights could eliminate the need for new runways \u2013 but such evidence gets in the way of their love for laying tarmac.

The arguments against Trident are well-rehearsed. But the very fact that building a new generation of weapons of mass destruction is pitched by politicians as central to our nationhood should give us pause for thought. What makes Britain need nukes so desperately when almost all other countries on earth maintain their safety without them?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/jul/18/caroline-lucas-challenges-theresa-may-trident-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4p2kh\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2619854\"            data-video-name=\"Green MP Caroline Lucas challenges Theresa May over Trident \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Parliament TV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-578d6718e4b06683917bdcf5\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/07/19/160718PMQMay2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/07/19/160718PMQMay2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/07/19/160718PMQMay2_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11700181&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/07/19/160718PMQMay2_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/jul/18/caroline-lucas-challenges-theresa-may-trident-video\">Green MP Caroline Lucas challenges Theresa May over Trident</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/13/labour-continue-back-trident-shadow-defence-secretary-nia-griffith\" title=\"\">Labour party\u2019s position on Trident is particularly strange</a>. It has stated that it is in favour of renewal \u2013 but the party has a leader who, quite rightly, says he would never fire the missiles if he became prime minister. Both positions have logic to them, but combined in one party and the end point is committing to building a nuclear weapons system based on the (flawed) theory of deterrence but with a cast-iron guarantee that the those submarines will do nothing more than float aimlessly around the ocean, in a constant state of readiness to do nothing. Perhaps one of the new vessels could be called HMS Pointless?</p> <p>Of course, if we scrap Trident we need to guarantee the jobs and economic security of those working at Faslane, Aldermaston and elsewhere. A \u201cdefence diversification agency\u201d would help to ensure a just transition for the people whose jobs are directly dependent on Trident.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just alternatives to Trident that are desperately needed. Instead of Hinkley, let\u2019s lead the world in energy conservation. Imagine, for example, that home insulation was central to the government\u2019s infrastructure plans. A <a href=\"http://www.energybillrevolution.org/whats-the-campaign/\" title=\"\">nationwide scheme</a> to keep people warm, cut fuel bills and tackle carbon emissions would create more than 100,000 jobs across the UK.</p> <p>Or imagine we redoubled our efforts to lead the world in renewables and energy storage technologies. That would create more jobs than nuclear weapons or power ever will. We know that green energy creates far more jobs per gigawatt and that every community in Britain can create its own power. Our energy system doesn\u2019t have to be centralised, or owned by multinational firms and foreign governments. It can be built in Britain, located in every community and it can be beautiful.</p> <p>Infrastructure isn\u2019t just about concrete and hard economic growth. It\u2019s about social connections, too. The qualitative growth that could come from a community learning new skills to manage and run renewable energy projects they own. The conversations over fences, in the post office and pub. It\u2019s the ties that bind us \u2013 and the networks that make us a whole greater than the sum of our parts.</p> <p>Indeed, I would argue that our biggest pieces of infrastructure aren\u2019t bridges, or buildings \u2013 they\u2019re the welfare state upon which we all rely, and our National Health Service. So when the government tells you it\u2019s investing in infrastructure, and then ministers don hard hats at opening ceremonies, remember what they\u2019re demolishing with one hand as they cut ribbons with the other.</p> <p>My challenge to both the government and the official opposition is simple: take a step back and think carefully about the kind of Britain we want to build. We\u2019re a small country, but we should be big in ambition. Let\u2019s pause for a moment before we pour more tarmac for more planes to land on, build obscenely expensive power plants or forge our path in the wake of submarines carrying weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p>This is a fork in the road \u2013 and we have a chance to build an economy that not only meets the challenges of the 21st century head-on but creates a better country in the process. Let\u2019s not miss this opportunity.</p>",

According to <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/2016/10/31/corgan-loses-legal-effort-take-over-tna/93069526/\">the Tennessean newspaper</a>, Corgan claimed he had given the cash-strapped TNA three loans in recent months, with the most recent one given on the proviso that he would gain control of the company should it become insolvent. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d1dbffa326b14e8e202a038c0edd2b56f4736f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d1dbffa326b14e8e202a038c0edd2b56f4736f0/0_65_4210_2526/1000.jpg\" alt=\"No holds barred \u2026 TNA Wrestling.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No holds barred \u2026 TNA Wrestling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joern Pollex/Bongarts/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The court ruled instead that TNA are only required to pay Corgan back his loan with interest.

Rather, I\u2019m grateful the judge considered the case. It\u2019s important to note these proceedings have brought forth facts which illuminate business practices I have fought against for a reason.

Soon after launching his presidential campaign, Trump said of the Arizona senator and former Vietnam prisoner of war John McCain: \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero. He\u2019s a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d</p> <p>It later emerged that Trump had been granted four education draft deferments and one medical. The latter was due to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/us/politics/donald-trump-draft-record.html\">bone spurs in his heels</a>.</p> <p>Cohen, who was McCain\u2019s best man, recalled: \u201cI was outraged about it. To this day John McCain can\u2019t lift his arm to shoulder level. To say that about what he went through being tortured, his sense of patriotism, from a man who avoided the draft with a bone spur? No, I don\u2019t think so.

Republicans were ultimately forced to conclude that Trump would be Trump, a 70-year-old man who cannot change and has no intention of doing so. They will never know if staying \u201con message\u201d might have left him running far closer in the polls.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018The straw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u2019</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.mullings.com/\">Rich Galen</a>, once press secretary to vice-president Dan Quayle, said his patience ran out in July when the nominee claimed that Gonzalo Curiel, a judge who was born in Indiana, was biased against him in a civil case over Trump University because his parents were from Mexico. </p> <p>\u201cThat was antithetical to everything I\u2019ve worked for in public life,\u201d Galen said. </p> <p>\u201cIt looks like the actual turning point was the Miss Universe woman, which not only offended women but they told their husbands they should be offended too. It\u2019s one thing to diss John McCain but he\u2019s a big boy and can look after himself. When he went after a woman over an image problem, that would unite 90% of women and men and was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\u201d</p> <p>Machado won the Miss Universe pageant in 1996.

To the dismay of his party, Trump took the bait and talked about Machado for days, telling Fox News: \u201cShe gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe sees the entire universe in terms of how it affects him,\u201d Galen said. \u201cHe simply doesn\u2019t have the temperament to be president of the United States. He figured out what the country had been mad about; he was the wrong messenger for the right message.\u201d</p> <p>Trump accused Mexican immigrants of being \u201crapists\u201d, drug traffickers and criminals at his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-announces-run-president\">campaign launch in June 2015</a>.

Republican consultant <a href=\"http://www.thejharriscompany.com/staff.php\">James Harris</a> believes that if he had managed to avoid all his gaffes, Trump would be leading in the polls. It is a case of what might have been.</p> <p>\u201cBut for Trump\u2019s comments and self-inflicted wounds and random tangents,\u201d he said, \u201che would be tied or up a point or two in Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Nevada.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at wage stagnation in those states, they want change, but he is not articulating a vision of change.

When we started recording, Love Train didn\u2019t even have lyrics, so Kenny came up with them in five minutes, on the spot.</p> <p>At that stage, I don\u2019t think any of us had any idea how big that song would become, but by the time we started laying down the vocals, we knew we had a hit. Love Train felt like destiny.

Researchers from the University of Cambridge and Stanford Business School argue that data from Facebook \u2013 the photos we upload, the statuses we share, the frequency and content of the messages we send to friends \u2013 is \u201cmore reliable\u201d than offline self-reported information, which is often considered to be inadequate or incomplete when it comes to understanding how mental illness is affecting someone.</p> <p>Status updates in particular, they say, can provide a \u201cwealth of information\u201d about users\u2019 mental health. A language analysis algorithm can pick up symptoms of mental illness, and could even flag early warning signs for conditions such as depression or schizophrenia. Yet more algorithms, these analysing pictures for \u201cemotional facial expressions\u201d could provide insights into offline behaviours. The next question is: what can we \u2013 and what can Facebook \u2013 do with that data?</p> <p>Of course, a lot of the information the company has on us all is superficial at best \u2013 sure, it might be slightly uncanny to have advertisements served to us that perfectly reflect our taste in music or the TV shows we\u2019ve discussed online, but it doesn\u2019t really say anything very essential about who we are as people. Data about mental or physical health, however, cannot be treated so flippantly, either by those of us who are thoughtlessly supplying it or by the people collecting it. Discrimination against those with mental health problems is still rife; a recent <a href=\"http://natcen.ac.uk/our-research/research/british-social-attitudes/\" title=\"\">NatCen British Social Attitudes survey</a>, for example, found that <a href=\"https://www.the-pool.com/health/mind/2016/32/emily-reynolds-on-the-persistent-stigma-associated-with-psychosis-and-schizophrenia\" title=\"\">44% of people would be \u201cuncomfortable\u201d</a> working with someone who\u2019d experienced symptoms of psychosis. In legislative terms, this isn\u2019t supposed to impact chance of employment or employment rights. In reality, there is a persistent and pervasive culture of distrust around those with mental health problems.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What if an algorithmic branding of 'ill' was shared with the world without our knowledge or consent?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Understandably, many people choose not to share the status of their mental health with colleagues or friends. But such privacy may be a luxury when \u201cemotional facial expressions\u201d can be neatly scanned and categorised by an algorithm, or when our heartfelt statuses are simply part of an input-output exchange. What if employers were able to use the same technology to scan our private posts, monitoring what we say and how we say it to avoid taking a risk on someone they may see as a \u201cliability\u201d? What if the data wasn\u2019t secure, and an algorithmic branding of \u201cill\u201d was shared with the world without our knowledge or consent?</p> <p>As the study suggests, the internet can be a vital tool in how people express themselves about their mental illness, from the grandiose horrors of a serious breakdown to the minutiae of living day-to-day with a chronic illness. We can also foster genuine connections with others who might be experiencing the same things. And the potential benefits of the findings are clear \u2013 not least in the way we could be able to reach people such as refugees, the homeless or the elderly who are often shut out of traditional mental health services. We may even be able to find new therapeutic routes or platforms with which to help people.</p> <p>What we can\u2019t do, however, is continue to proceed the way that we are. The ethics of this particular study aren\u2019t questionable; everybody involved in the study consented to their data being used, after all. But if it were to be used more broadly? The team suggests that detection of poor mental health could be a way for social networks to provide on-site support for users \u2013 in which case we may have a problem. For one thing, on a practical level, vulnerable users may not fully understand what their participation in such a scheme would mean, nor know the impact it could have on them. We need strict legislation about the ethics of gathering such sensitive data, and even stricter punishments should it be inadvertently or purposefully shared.</p> <p>And, as we must never forget, Facebook makes money from our data. Slotting us into neat little boxes may be OK when it comes to things such as gender or age \u2013 what does that say about us, really? \u2013 but the idea of being neatly categorised as \u201cmentally ill\u201d or \u201cmentally well\u201d simply because of the things we choose to share online is both unethical and potentially dangerous. At best, of course, we could receive help that is currently unavailable to us. At worst? It doesn\u2019t bear thinking about.</p>",
  "<p>Before birth control pills and disposable tampons were widely available, women relied on futile contraceptive methods (like withdrawal) and clunky belted contraptions stuffed with lard-coated sheep\u2019s wool to absorb menstrual blood. In the 19th century, it was considered improper for upper-class unmarried women to walk about in public without a male family member or a married female friend as escorts \u2013 and when one did, there was stringent decorum to follow (missteps like raising one\u2019s petticoat to step over a puddle or retying one\u2019s bonnet strings were seen as provocative, even scandalous gestures). In <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Unmentionable-Victorian-Ladys-Marriage-Manners/dp/031635791X\">Unmentionable: The Victorian Lady\u2019s Guide to Sex, Marriage, and Manners</a>, <a href=\"https://writerthereseoneill.com/\">Therese Oneill</a> delves into the social expectations and beauty standards that women of a certain milieu (white, middle to upper-class, living in American or western European cities) contended with during the Victorian era.</p> <p>Oneill guides the reader through sections about fashion and beauty trends, general hygiene practices (or lack thereof), and expectations for courtship and marriage. The chapter titles underscore the narrator\u2019s sharp wit: You\u2019re Doing it Wrong covers menstruation; How to Properly Hide Your Shame is about getting dressed; and You\u2019re a Little Bag of Pudding is on dieting trends. Early on, Oneill establishes what kind of narrator she will be, writing simply: \u201cI am capricious and omnipotent.\u201d She warns that this will not be a 19th century book brimming with \u201cdelightful and aromatic\u201d details but rather one that gets into \u201cthe bitter dark brew underneath\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Women slept with raw meat tied to their faces as a treatment for wrinkles</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That bitter, dark brew underneath, as it turns out, is rich with information that will amuse and sometimes horrify its readers. To ease the transmission of such knowledge, Oneill addresses the reader affectionately, calling her/him by terms of endearment like \u201cdarling\u201d, \u201ccherie\u201d and \u201clambkin\u201d. (Other words she uses: dear one, missy, chubby little cherub, my virgin flower, my little dumpling, you tawdry thing, dearheart, my gosling, pet, fragile flower, and my intelligent companion.) She oscillates between playing the role of the benevolent, all-knowing guide; the conspiring comrade and confidante; the whipsmart friend; and the expert Victorian slang translator. The reader, she presumes, is weary of 21st century fashions, and excited to wear elaborate dresses to ornate parties \u2013 surely a Jane <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/austenphile\">Austenphile</a>. \u201cDear one,\u201d she writes, the 19th century was horrendous for women, and not for the faint of heart.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ddff163742b46db0bbc61f6d3475a2209be3eb93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddff163742b46db0bbc61f6d3475a2209be3eb93/0_0_1448_2179/665.jpg\" alt=\"On the shlef: an image from Unmentionable\" width=\"665\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On the shelf: an image from Unmentionable.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Beauty standards were the same then as they are now \u2013 narrow, damaging and highly variable by class. The specifics have changed though; for Victorian women, the idealized body was what Oneill terms \u201copulent but lithe\u201d, plump without being fat, small-waisted but not too delicate, and possessing hourglass proportions. To mold their bodies into the desirable (and impossible to achieve) physiques, women wore corsets ribbed with steel and whalebones. Hoop skirts resembling cages served as the structural support and weight distributor for heavy layers of crinoline and petticoats. Underneath, crotchless pants were worn to make squatting over one\u2019s chamber pot, or, primitive toilet seat, easier.</p> <p>Through irreverent prose, readers learn that powdery white lead was used as a makeup base, until enough enamel-faced women dropped dead from lead poisoning. Also, a significant amount of women, as Oneill explains, slept with raw meat tied to their faces as a preventative treatment for wrinkles (the idea came from trying to replace fatty tissue with other fatty tissues). Even more disturbingly, women that wanted to lose weight bought tapeworm larvae, which they swallowed in pill form to let grow in their intestines. Have you read enough? Oneill will tell you, then, that Victorian couples used condoms made from thick animal-skin sheaths that were often painful for both partners.</p> <p>Most of the sources Oneill cites propagate misinformation about female anatomy and sexuality; some parts are depressingly prescient, while others are amusingly archaic. When, in 2016, a presidential candidate doesn\u2019t understand how an abortion works (\u201ci<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfdRmnT0Weo\">n the ninth month you can take the baby, and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother</a>\u201d), and a large swath of the American population believe that women shouldn\u2019t have control over their bodies, it feels, unfortunately quite salient to look at the ways Victorian literature denigrated women\u2019s bodies.</p> <p>To inform the book, Oneill pored over scientific articles and academic books, written almost exclusively by men, the majority of whom hold deeply misogynistic beliefs. They hypothesized that female orgasms radiate from the womb, and that masturbation (what they called \u201cself-abuse\u201d) causes a wide range of problems: finger warts, uterine disease, cancer of the womb, sterility, small or droopy breasts and spinal abnormalities.

It banned \u201cevery obscene, lewd, or lascivious book, pamphlet, picture, paper, writing, print, or other publication of an indecent character, and every article\u201d related to human sexuality, broadly, and contraceptive methods, specifically. (This is the law that was used in 1914 to indict <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pill/peopleevents/p_sanger.html\">Margaret Sanger</a>, founder of Planned Parenthood, for publishing an informative pamphlet about birth control.)</p> <p>Unusual sepia-toned illustrations, archival photographs, and advertisements (for crocheted sanitary products and arsenic facial wafers, among other things) appear throughout the book. These visual breaks provide comic relief from the grim realities that each chapter presents anew. In a section about the proper etiquette for travel (wear plain, neutral-colored clothing, no jewelry), Oneill includes a photograph of her great-grandmother and sister. She punctuates each photo with a sly caption (for instance, under an ad for menstrual aprons, she writes: \u201cYour late-19th century armory against the Red Baron(ess)\u201d).</p> <p>To some, the narrator\u2019s affected tone and liberal use of personal pronouns may be overwrought, but it\u2019s precisely that playful application of language that makes the horrendous plight of Victorian women palatable to modern audiences. Oneill succeeds in making otherwise dry information (the proper order of eating utensils, the development of modern sanitation) sparkle while introducing colloquialisms from the \u201chistorical epoch of quackery\u201d that are sure to entertain her readers. (If Victorian slang for sex \u2013 \u201cplaying a game of nug-a-nug\u201d, \u201cscrumping\u201d and \u201cbonestorming\u201d \u2013 doesn\u2019t invite a cackle \u2026)</p> <p>Oneill brings the reader back into the modern era with a list of things not to be taken for granted, among them: pants, marital rights, fat-free froyo, effective ibuprofen, shampoo, high-performance synthetics, and male partners capable of cooking dinner. As she concludes, in what could be interpreted by optimistic readers as a triumphant message: \u201cEach generation [wipes] away one more layer of patronizing grime from the minds of their descendants.\u201d</p>",

The announcement followed the establishment of a similar investigation by the Home Office <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/may/26/theresa-may-launches-sharia-law-review\">in May</a>.</p> <p>In the letter, signed by 100 Muslim women from a range of professions, Gohir welcomed both inquiries, but warned that \u201cclosing down sharia councils would drive divorce services underground, leading to even less transparency and more discrimination\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere are many provisions in Islam that allow women to obtain a religious divorce quickly, without duress and discrimination, that sharia councils should be practising,\u201d wrote Gohir, who will give evidence to the committee on Tuesday.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems that various parties, to further their own agendas, are using Muslim women as a political football,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is therefore essential that both investigations prioritise the voices of Muslim women and ensure that the diversity of Muslim women\u2019s voices is considered first and foremost.\u201d<br></p> <p>She said the committee inquiry was not hearing evidence from enough Muslim women or women who had experience of using the sharia court system.</p> <p>Among other topics, the committee inquiry will look at the extent to which sharia courts discriminate against women. In written evidence submitted to the inquiry, the Southall Black Sisters women\u2019s rights group accused the Muslim Arbitration Tribunal (Mat), a sharia court based in Nuneaton, of \u201csabotaging criminal proceedings\u201d against men accused of domestic violence.</p> <p>The evidence from the group reads: \u201cSharia councils and the Mat hold themselves out to be \u2018courts of law\u2019 but they are in fact highly arbitrary decision-making forums that use dominant, patriarchal and authoritarian interpretations of Muslim codes which are passed off as \u2018sharia\u2019 laws.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jun/27/mps-launch-inquiry-sharia-law-courts-uk\">MPs launch inquiry into sharia courts in UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In response, the Mat said it condemned actions taken by anyone to \u201crestrict or impede the pathway to justice sought by any victim of domestic violence\u201d.</p> <p> In her letter, Gohir said sharia courts in the UK were not applying Islamic rulings consistently and urged the government to provide alternative civil solutions so that Muslim women were not solely dependent on religious institutions for divorce. \u201cThis could include making a civil marriage compulsory prior to a religious marriage because in most cases a civil divorce can be recognised as an Islamic divorce,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>\u201cIslam is neither rigid nor limited to narrow and conservative interpretations. Muslims who view Islam in that manner do not represent Islam in its entirety. Likewise, those secularists who view Islam in a reductionist manner will campaign to limit religion to the private domain and want it eliminated from all public discourse.

From lists of legally constituted companies to the country\u2019s geospatial data, our data infrastructure needs to be managed, maintained, in some cases built and in all cases made as widely available as possible.</p> <p>To maximise the benefits to the UK\u2019s economy and to reduce costs in delivery of public services, the data we rely on needs to be adaptable, trustworthy, and as open as possible.</p> <p>A data infrastructure consists of data assets and the technology to store, share and use them; the organisations that operate and maintain them; the processes by which they are maintained; and guides describing how to use and manage the data. Trustworthy data infrastructure is sustainably funded and managed so it can be used in ways that benefit society.</p> <p>Good infrastructure is simply there when we need it but, at the moment, too much of our data infrastructure is unreliable, inaccessible or only available if you can pay for access. Data innovators struggle to get hold of data and to work out how they can best use it, while individuals do not feel that they are in control of their data.</p> <p>While we do have some excellent examples of infrastructure data from the likes of<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Companies House</a>,<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Land Registry</a>,<a href=\"https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Ordnance Survey</a> and<a href=\"http://environment.data.gov.uk/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Defra</a>, core parts of the data infrastructure that we need within the UK are missing, unreliable, or of a low quality. The government must invest here just as it invests in our other traditional infrastructure.</p> <h2>Support and promote data innovation</h2> <p>If we are to make best use of data, we need a bridge between academic research, public, private and third sectors, and a thriving startup ecosystem where new ideas and approaches can grow.</p> <p></p> <p>We have learned that properly targeted challenges could identify potential savings for government \u2013 similar to <a href=\"http://www.prescribinganalytics.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Prescribing Analytics</a>, an ODI-incubated startup which used publicly available data to identify <a href=\"https://theodi.org/news/prescription-savings-worth-millions-identified-odi-incubated-company\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u00a3200m in prescriptions savings</a> per year for the NHS \u2013 but, more importantly, translate that potential into procurable products and services that could deliver those savings.</p> <p>A data challenge series run at a larger scale, funded by <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/innovate-uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Innovate UK</a>, openly contested and independently managed, would stimulate the creation of new companies, jobs, products and services. It would also act as a forcing function to strengthen data infrastructure around key challenges, and raise awareness and capacity for those working to solve them. The data needed to satisfy the challenges would have to be made available and usable, bringing data innovation into government and bolstering the offer of the startups and SMEs who take part.</p> <h2>Invest in data literacy</h2> <p>In order to take advantage of the data revolution, policymakers, businesses and citizens need to understand how to make use of data. In other words, they must become data literate.</p> <p>Data literacy is needed through our whole educational system and society more generally. Crucially, policymakers are going to need to be informed by insights that can only be gleaned through understanding and analysing data effectively.</p> <p>We have to move the dial here. It is an investment we cannot afford to shirk. Strengthening our data infrastructure, supporting and promoting innovation using that infrastructure, and investing in widespread data literacy will be the only way to succeed as a nation in the 21st century.</p> <p><em>Sir Nigel Shadbolt is principal of<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_College,_Oxford\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Jesus College, Oxford</a>, professorial research fellow in the<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Computer_Science,_University_of_Oxford\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford</a>, and chairman and co-founder of the<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Data_Institute\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Open Data Institute</a>.

  "<p>I am dressed in cowboy gear and closing my hands around a woman\u2019s neck. \u201cCareful, baby,\u201d I warn her in a chilling Texas drawl as she gasps for breath. \u201cI\u2019m rotten. Rotten to the core.\u201d</p> <p>This, it\u2019s fair to say, is not my average Wednesday night. I\u2019m on stage at the Norwich Arts Centre, where the audience is looking on in charged silence. For one night only, I have been cast as Him in A Girl and a Gun, a playful, provocative show written by the woman I am pretending to strangle: 29-year-old artist and performer <a href=\"http://louiseorwin.com/\">Louise Orwin</a>, who is wearing a red dress and suede boots, with a basket of cherries dangling from her arm. I glance at the autocue for my next line, fearful of what I might be asked to say \u2013 or do \u2013 next.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/179443401\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/179443401\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Trailer for A Girl and a Gun</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The show takes its title from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jeanlucgodard\">Jean-Luc Godard</a>, who said that all you need to make a movie is \u201ca girl and a gun\u201d. Borrowing the iconography of both westerns and film noir, it explores ideas of consent and control in popular entertainment. All of which might be forbiddingly dry were it not for the unstable element built into the concept: each night Orwin, as Her, is joined on stage for the entire 70-minute performance by a different Him, whom she has never met before.<br></p> <p>Though her co-star will have been cast in advance from a small pool of local actors, he will not have seen the script. He will be briefed by Orwin for the first time, as I was, only 15 minutes before curtain-up. (\u201cHave fun with it!\u201d she advised me.) He will read everything from the autocue, with many of his lines and stage directions visible to the audience, which creates a delicious element of suspense whenever he is called on to do something ridiculous or menacing. The effect, from the inside at least, is like an episode of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/11/josie-lawrence-greg-proops-whose-line-is-it-anyway\">Whose Line Is It Anyway?</a> devised by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/may/12/marina-abramovic-ready-to-die-serpentine-gallery-512-hours\">Marina Abramovi\u0107</a>.</p> <p>After the play\u2019s explosive ending, Orwin and I convene backstage. \u201cYou were amazing!\u201d she says as we share a congratulatory hug. I feel exhilarated and find myself wondering if the Oliviers have a category for best one-off performance at an East Anglian arts venue. But I am also slightly shellshocked. The show moves imperceptibly from goofy to grisly and, by the end, I had done some pretty reprehensible things. Orwin was unmistakably in charge: she knew what was coming, whereas I didn\u2019t have a clue. Still, that doesn\u2019t quite feel like the get-out I expected it to be. Who did I become up there? Was I Him or me? And how much of what I did was my choice?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"88d55a93d30d0344fdce6342cae085672d055ef3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88d55a93d30d0344fdce6342cae085672d055ef3/253_404_3425_5052/678.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018By the end, I had done some pretty reprehensible things\u2019 \u2026 Gilbey and Orwin.\" width=\"678\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018By the end, I had done some pretty reprehensible things\u2019 \u2026 Gilbey and Orwin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Pope/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I meet Orwin at a cafe the following morning, she seems pleased with my confusion. \u201cI want to question who\u2019s controlling who,\u201d she says. \u201cThat dynamic fascinates me. It\u2019s interesting that some older women who see the show can\u2019t understand why I\u2019d want to recreate this masochistic, submissive female imagery. They aren\u2019t able to see that I\u2019m calling the shots.\u201d </p> <p>The show emerged from her awareness of the sexualisation of violence toward women in pop culture, but it has its roots also in what she calls her \u201ctangled\u201d relationship with her own femininity: \u201cHow do I know I\u2019ve <em>chosen</em> to be a femme-presenting woman? How do I know that\u2019s not something I\u2019ve been tricked into?\u201d</p> <p>She thinks our show went well, but adds that it can\u2019t ever really fail. \u201cI have to stick to my guns \u2013 excuse the pun \u2013 and say that it\u2019s a genuine experiment, so there\u2019s no way it can go wrong.\u201d Even allowing for that, there have been some tense moments. \u201cOne guy started singing some of his lines very angrily, which I felt was his way of saying, \u2018Screw you!\u2019 And there have been times where I\u2019ve felt genuinely threatened. Once, I started crying on stage. I think the man represented and tapped into experiences I\u2019ve had in my life. That masculine energy can be so competitive and overpowering, even when I know I\u2019m in control. I was asking him to do these things to me, but I wasn\u2019t in love with the gusto he was bringing to it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When she has finished making a show, Orwin tends to think: \u2018Why did it have to be another horrible one?\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her last show, <a href=\"http://louiseorwin.com/pretty-ugly\">Pretty Ugly</a><a href=\"https://prettyorugly.wordpress.com/about-the-project/\">,</a> also examined notions of consent and objectification.

As if that wasn\u2019t traumatic enough, one of her alter egos inadvertently baited a paedophile. \u201cThe police got involved. At the time I felt incapable of dealing with it.

But so far she has avoided actively taking on advertisers because of the effect on her listeners: \u201cOne of the main important themes for me as a podcaster is integrity to my audience.\u201d</p> <p>While she is a passionate advocate for podcasting, she admits it\u2019s not necessarily for everyone. \u201cIf you like a bit of a chatter, if you like to tell stories, that\u2019s a good medium for you.\u201d Authenticity, she stresses, is important. \u201cYou want to be the pickled onion Monster Munch of your genre.

It\u2019s about enhancing people\u2019s experience of beer.\u201d</p> <p>Hickson felt there was a gap in the market for a beer podcast \u201cthat wasn\u2019t just two people in a room cracking open a beer and tasting it\u201d. As small retailers, they have good working relationships with many of the UK\u2019s craft breweries and hold regular events \u2013 from \u201cmeet the brewers\u201d and \u201chow to homebrew\u201d classes, to beer and food pairing. </p> <p>\u201cI felt like we actually have a really unique insight to the beer industry that we could give to our listeners,\u201d he says. \u201c[And as luck would have it] we\u2019d also recently hired someone to work in the shops who was a freelance sound engineer.\u201d A <a href=\"https://www.webroughtbeer.co.uk/podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\">podcast</a> was born. </p> <p>The initial reaction has been good, with each episode garnering around 300 listens and mostly centring around live recordings of their events. The cost of setting it up has been relatively low, although it does take time, and while Hickson can\u2019t point to increased sales as a consequence, he says it still feels worth it. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of those intangible things but it builds trust, credibility, expertise, brand love, brand loyalty and it\u2019s just a cool, fun thing to do. If anything, I\u2019m doing it for myself as well.\u201d</p> <p>His advice to others? \u201cIf you think you\u2019ve got something interesting to say, then go for it, invest \u00a3100 in a microphone, put some thought into the scripting, record something and get it out there.\u201d </p> <h2>The lawyer</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0ececea26d29892e240b6b5d4b092bae92cdb592\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ececea26d29892e240b6b5d4b092bae92cdb592/0_200_1512_1890/800.jpg\" alt=\"Alison Colley\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alison Colley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shahinara Craveiro</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alison Colley already had some experience of podcasting when she started her <a href=\"http://alisoncolley.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">employment law business</a> in 2013.

It\u2019s a job she usually fits in on a Sunday evening so it doesn\u2019t impact on the working week. </p> <p>She enjoys the work, even though measuring the direct impact it\u2019s had on her business is hard to do. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s part of a wider marketing strategy. It\u2019s another way of showing what I do [and] it differentiates me from other solicitors and employment law providers.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking about it, just go for it.

Today, the ratio is about 50:50. </p> <p>\u201cPeople are understandably nervous [when they approach financial advisers],\u201d Matthew says. \u201cPutting something of yourself out on to the internet [is] a great mechanism for breaking down initial barriers, when it comes to considering doing business with you.\u201d </p> <p>He started producing videos under the <a href=\"http://meaningfulmoney.tv/\" rel=\"nofollow\">MeaningfulMoney</a> brand in 2010 and had 300 on YouTube before turning to podcasting in 2012. Matthew primarily offers financial planning advice and interviews others in the field. The uplift in new business, he insists has been a happy, but unintentional, consequence. </p> <p>He warns against starting a podcast purely for generating more business. \u201cPeople\u2019s bullshit radar is fairly finely attuned these days, so if [that\u2019s] your primary motivation, it will be evident.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/nov/09/break-through-noise-power-podcasting-business\">Break through the noise: the power of podcasting in business</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since it launched, the podcast has been downloaded 650,000 times and is expected to reach an average of 1,000 downloads a day this month. It is regularly in the top five of business shows on iTunes in the UK.

Even now, it is still a very impressive structure, and continues to be used for special events like huge open-air concerts.</p> <h2>And the worst ...</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf3e50e11a647c34af4cf45281645ce34f21e414\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf3e50e11a647c34af4cf45281645ce34f21e414/0_0_1280_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kaufhof, Munich\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the stops on Munich\u2019s ugly tour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Monika Screiner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the moment there\u2019s an ongoing discussion in the media about ugly spaces in Munich \u2013 there\u2019s even a Munich ugly tour, which is given by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/may/02/vienna-austria-ugly-walking-tour\">Eugene Quinn</a> in cooperation with Green City. </p> <p>But one building regularly makes me upset: the Kaufhof building. During the 70s, a nice historical building (Roman-Mayr-House) was torn down in order to erect this new department store \u2013 in an attempt to show how innovative they were back then. For me, it does not really fit in the square it calls home. </p> <h2>Homegrown talent</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FcmcI6BvQQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8FcmcI6BvQQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The Young Chinese Dogs are just one of Munich\u2019s great bands. Founded in 2011, they play folkpop music and, like street musicians, they only use easily portable instruments. This video, for their song Sweet Little Lies, shows many aspects of Munich city life \u2013 the Olympic park, Oktoberfest and the river Isar. Once in a while they play concerts in the city.</p> <h2>What does Munich do better than anywhere else?</h2> <p>River surfing. Munich offers some of Europe\u2019s best waves, and during the summer you can see surfers transporting their boards on bikes through the city to the number one surfing spot: the Eisbach wave in the English Garden. The water comes from the river Isar.</p> <h2>Street style</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Munich street style\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:62.5% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/96oToTR-HU/&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Olga (@lapetiteolga)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2015-11-10T19:30:13+00:00&quot;&gt;Nov 10, 2015 at 11:30am PST&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>People like things casual here, but also very chic. Munich is said to be the most northern town of Italy \u2013 and that\u2019s certainly true when it comes to fashion. Crazy sartorial experiments are seldom seen on these streets.</p> <h2>How green is your city?</h2> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.muenchen.de/int/en/sights/parks/english-garden.html\">English garden</a> and the Isar are the green lungs of the city \u2013 but other, less famous parks include the Westpark, Buga Parc and Luitpold Parc. Riding your bike to work is becoming more common, but there are still a lot of people who love their cars. Overall, though, Munich is a clean city. Like everywhere in Germany, waste separation is important, and for a while now department stores have been charging for plastic bags.</p> <h2>Most under-rated location</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7594a3a2b79729fe8406dcb80d65d2560cf5db4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7594a3a2b79729fe8406dcb80d65d2560cf5db4c/0_0_840_560/500.jpg\" alt=\"Import Export\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A temporary space that found a more permanent home \u2026 the Import Export.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Monika Schreiner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I would say the <a href=\"http://www.import-export.cc/\">Import Export</a>. It started as a temporary project of the M\u00fcnchner Kammerspiele, which is a very well known theatre in Munich. They transformed a Turkish vegetable shop into a cultural space back in 2010, with the aim of bringing Turkish and German culture together. It was situated not far from the main station, an area where a lot of Turkish people go shopping. Lectures, concerts, workshops for kids and exhibitions all took place there.<br></p> <p>In 2013 it moved to the <em>Kreativquartier</em> (creative quarter), an artist space close to the Olympic park, into a former locksmith shop. As the location itself is a little hidden, people really have to know about it to find it.</p> <h2>Moment in history</h2> <p>The wedding of the Crown Prince Ludwig and Princess Therese in October 1810: this was the moment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/sep/20/oktoberfest-the-worlds-largest-beer-festival-in-pictures\">the world\u2019s largest beer festival</a> was born. A horse race was held on the meadow just outside the city, now called the Theresienwiese, in honour of the bride. It eventually turned into Oktoberfest, and people living here call the festival Wiesn (an abbreviation of Theresienwiese, where it still takes place every year).</p> <h2>Best Instagram</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Munich Instagram\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BKq6SRehHKh/&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Marc Kapunkt (@marckapunkt)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-09-22T19:47:36+00:00&quot;&gt;Sep 22, 2016 at 12:47pm PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Marc is a newspaper journalist who has his camera with him at all times.

A very hip place, with its own roasting facility, is the coffee shop Man Versus Machine. Drinking filter coffee was not cool for a long time, but now there\u2019s been a revival. Their filter coffee is prepared in three different ways: pour-over, syphon or aeropress. Try a Franzbr\u00f6tchen (a cinnamon pastry) with your caffeine fix.</p> <h2>Best local artist</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3baf81a4f25a3b472350c14af20c80228c2db297\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3baf81a4f25a3b472350c14af20c80228c2db297/0_0_1200_800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gabi Blum\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blurred lines \u2026 the work of Gabi Blum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Monika Schreiner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I love the work of <a href=\"http://www.gabiblum.de/NEWS.html\">Gabi Blum</a>.

  "<p>Bloody hell, what are they? Bed bugs, says the man in the chemist, but who knew bed bugs were that big? The size of pit ponies \u2026 almost. Maybe it\u2019s just the ones in Sunderland: Mackem bed bugs.</p> <p>Or maybe it\u2019s just that <strong>Dark Angel</strong>, ITV\u2019s two-part drama about Victorian serial killer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/26/val-mcdermid-extract-forensics-the-anatomy-of-crime\">Mary Ann Cotton</a>, wants to be very clear about what\u2019s what and what\u2019s going on. Bed bugs, dialogue, plot lines \u2013 make them all bigger, bloody great signposts: <em>this</em> is going on.</p> <p>Mary Ann (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0296219/\">Joanne Froggatt</a>, Downton Abbey\u2019s Anna) has come to Sunderland from Seaham, down the coast, with unemployed husband number one and their only remaining child (Mary Ann\u2019s offspring tend not to last very long, like her husbands). While scrubbing out their squalid rented room, she finds the supersized insects in the mattress.</p> <p>\u201cArsenic, it\u2019s the only thing that works against bed bugs that I know of,\u201d says the chemist.</p> <p>Got that? Arsenic \u2013 the well-known deadly poison? But just in case you missed it, Mary Ann tells her daughter to stay away. \u201cThis is arsenic; it\u2019s poisonous \u2013 that\u2019s why it kills the bugs.\u201d Not just bugs ...</p> <p>First she has to write her name down in a book: the government doesn\u2019t allow them to hand out arsenic to anyone who wants it any more, the chemist explains. \u201cThey\u2019d be no husbands left,\u201d jokes Mary Ann. Ha ha.</p> <p>\u201cRemind me not to get on the wrong side of you, love,\u201d says the handsome bit of rough who\u2019s just then walked into the store.</p> <p>He\u2019s called Joe Natrass \u2013 sounds like mattress \u2013 also infested by the look of it, though he scrubs up well, he says flirtatiously. We won\u2019t bother with the names of Mary Ann\u2019s husbands or children \u2013 they\u2019re temporary, as I mentioned.</p> <p>All set then. Useless husband: check. Next bedmate (and potential fatherer of further children) lined up: check. Poison: check. Also life insurance in place \u2013 that\u2019s important. Mary Ann\u2019s stepdad George (he lasts the distance, so he can have a name, and an actor, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0035605/\">Alun Armstrong</a>) sorted the life insurance for the first one, but after that Mary Ann develops a taste for monetising her fellas and makes sure they\u2019re insured herself.</p> <p>Oh \u2013 and the teapot. At first glance, just an ordinary brown family teapot, given to Mary Ann by her own mother, because nothing says home more than an old brown family teapot.</p> <p>Until it becomes \u2026 the Teapot of Death. Into which a few drops of you-know-what can be snuck. And soon hubby number one is gasping and spluttering and dissolving on the inside.</p> <p>Dark Angel settles into its pattern. Scrubbing, pumping water, rent overdue \u2013 tough Victorian life with only the occasional shag to brighten the gloom \u2013 every single one of which results in a baby. And then all the babies die, another little coffin lowered into the ground. Is she killing them too, or some of them, or are they really dying of scarlet fever and typhoid etc? I wasn\u2019t quite sure about that.</p> <p>But anyway, the fun\u2019s with the mariticide, which starts with a trip to the 19th-century equivalent of the Legal &amp; General to pick up a policy, just in case. And then, back at home (to paraphrase): you useless man, what good are you to me, especially now you\u2019ve lost your job/mojo in the bedroom, but never mind, let\u2019s have a nice cuppa tea shall we, aye love \u2026 And down from the shelf comes the Teapot of Death.</p> <p>Another husband is also lowered into the ground. Mary Ann goes for a windy walk on the beach to reflect on being really really bad, then has a really good shag with dirty Joe Natrass under the pier, before popping into the L&amp;G to pick up her \u00a335. That was the going rate for a husband, back then.</p> <p>She gets through a couple in the opening episode, and is well into number three. There\u2019ll be more to come. And we know where it\u2019s going, as that\u2019s where it begins: at the end, Durham gaol, with a dirty great gallows in the yard.</p> <p>Stepdad George is over to say goodbye. \u201cWhen I think of the day you came home to us,\u201d he says, sadly. \u201cWhen I think of your dark eyes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThem was days of joy to all our souls,\u201d reflects Mary Ann. It\u2019s all even more fun with a north-east accent.</p> <p>I may not have the strength for part two, but I thoroughly enjoyed the first episode, though possibly not always as I was supposed to. A Halloween hoot.</p> <h2><strong>And another thing\u2026</strong> </h2> <p>The Crown (Netflix, from Friday). With Claire Foy, as convincing as Queen as she was as Anne Boleyn, and Matt (Smith) The Doctor as Phil The Greek. Properly splendid: get involved.</p>",
  "<p>MI5 has its roots in the run-up to the first world war. In 1909, the targets were suspected agents working for German naval intelligence, the focus was on Germans living in Britain. The Daily Mail, as ever, was alert to the danger, advising readers: \u201cIf your waiter is German, refuse to be served by him.\u201d </p> <p>In the 107 years since, there have been 17 director generals of MI5. Until 1993, their identities were a state secret. And even after an emergence of sorts into the public eye, the guiding rule to their life at work was: say as little as possible and what you do say, say discreetly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/31/andrew-parker-increasingly-aggressive-russia-a-growing-threat-to-uk-says-mi5-head\">\u2018Increasingly aggressive\u2019 Russia a growing threat to UK, says MI5 head</a> </p> </aside>  <p>None has ever given a newspaper interview.

Secrecy is not something we need for its own sake.</p> <p>\u201cThe Guardian takes a clear interest in the work we do \u2013 some of it is well informed, some less so.

The first is Islamic-inspired terror, which he calls enduring and generational.</p> <p>\u201cInternational terrorism in its latest shape, based on twisted ideology, brings terror to our streets and most of the developed world, including North America, Australia and Turkey,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cCurrently, the flavour of it is Daesh, or Isil [Islamic State], and we still have the al-Qaida brand. This is something we have to understand: it\u2019s here to stay. It is an enduring threat and it\u2019s at least a generational challenge for us to deal with.\u201d</p> <p>He says the number of terror plots thwarted in the past three years stands at 12. \u201cThat sort of tempo of terrorist plot and attempts is concerning and it\u2019s enduring. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/29/mi5-chief-terrorist-threat-uk-greater-than-any-point-career\">Attacks in this country are higher</a> than I have experienced in the rest of my career \u2013 and I\u2019ve been working at MI5 for 33 years.

He is most exercised about Russia, which he says is at work across Europe and in the UK, using military means, propaganda, espionage, subversion and cyber-attacks to achieve its foreign policy aims. \u201cIt\u2019s MI5\u2019s job to get in the way of that.\u201d</p> <p>Parker says the threat from Russia is real \u2013 in part because it is so varied. \u201cWe see it in places such as Ukraine and the appalling brutalities in Syria.\u201d</p> <p>Parker, 54, keeps most of his background under wraps. The most obvious thing about him is that he is tall \u2013 well over 6ft. He must have got into the service before rules were introduced saying that any male over 5ft 11ins \u2013 or female over 5ft 8ins \u2013 ought not to be taken on as surveillance officers because they would stand out in a crowd. They also say agents should not have any visible tattoos for the same reason. Parker passes that test.</p> <p>But when asked, he tells us that he comes from Newcastle and went to a comprehensive school before getting a degree in natural sciences from Cambridge University. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f6489e1c66519ae69ed02139611c407b1dc19cd8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6489e1c66519ae69ed02139611c407b1dc19cd8/0_259_3078_1846/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Parker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Parker is a fan of wildlife photography. \u2018It\u2019s a good way to unwind\u2019, he says.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MI5/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That is the first ever mention of Newcastle and a comprehensive education.

We have to approach, cultivate and recruit people to be agents to work for us.

Current jobs on offer include: cyber-risk accreditor, senior business analyst, information architect, problem analyst, covert technical operations specialist, and security architect.</p> <p>But the issue of mass surveillance will not go away.

  "<p>Anyone who has written a CV has probably had to overcome a number of challenges \u2013 whether they be lack of work experience, gaps in employment or explaining a short stint that didn\u2019t work out.</p> <p>Facing these issues when writing your CV does not mean you\u2019re not a worthy employee, it just means that you must find ways to explain areas that may appear negative to recruiters. If you\u2019re struggling to explain discrepancies on your CV, the following examples will show how you can reflect your experience more positively.</p> <h2>I have gaps on my CV</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/careers-blog/minimising-problems-on-a-cv\">Mind the gap: don't let missing work history damage your CV and interview</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many people go through periods of unemployment, it\u2019s perfectly natural. But leaving unexplained gaps on your CV will arouse suspicion with recruiters, so you need to meet the issue head-on and explain it. Whether you have taken time out to travel, taken on a personal project or cared for a loved one \u2013 you need to include this information and put a positive spin on it. These activities still involve core workplace skills such as planning, organisation and communication, which can be included on your CV. If you have taken time out for illness, there\u2019s no need to be ashamed about it; mention it on your CV and show that you\u2019re ready to take on the rigours of work again.</p> <h2>My CV is too long</h2> <p>If your CV is three pages or more, you need to cut it down to hold the attention of hiring managers. Two pages is ideal to sell yourself without boring people. Take a look at some of your older roles and see if you can condense them. Recruiters don\u2019t need to know about a role from 10 years ago in great detail, so a short summary will suffice, leaving you more space to explain your most recent work, which is more important. Also, check your formatting and make sure you are not wasting space with large margins and poorly structured contact details.</p> <h2>I lack direct work experience</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/careers-blog/how-to-write-cv-without-work-experience\">How to write a CV when you lack direct work experience</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you are an inexperienced candidate such as a recent school leaver, you may lack the work experience your target employers are looking for. To get around this, you need to draw out transferable skills from other areas of your experience and highlight them. For instance, you could use experience from your studies, voluntary work, personal projects or anything else that relates to the jobs you are applying for. If your current role isn\u2019t relevant, then reduce the amount of detail and only include skills that could be used in your new field.</p> <h2>I have done lots of short roles</h2> <p>Nowadays it\u2019s common to have short roles on your CV but it can still be a turn-off for employers if not properly explained. Some recruiters may assume you have been fired or lack commitment. To avoid appearing unreliable or a job-hopper, explain the purpose of each role and what you achieved before moving on. This will show you added value and fulfilled an important purpose for the organisation. If you have done lots of temping or contract roles make that clear so readers do not simply think that you haven\u2019t lasted long in permanent posts.</p> <h2>I want to change career</h2> <p>When you are looking to make a career change, it can be difficult to craft a CV that appeals to your target employers, as often you won\u2019t have the experience they are looking for. With the right preparation and adjustments, however, you can create a CV that sparks interest. </p> <p>An essential step is to make some form of commitment to your new field and highlight it at the top. This could be enrolling on a vocational course, doing voluntary work or even freelancing. Make it prominent on your CV to show employers that you are serious about your new career aspirations. You will also find that many of the skills used in your current line of work could probably be transferable to your new profession, so ensure you use your existing work experience to sell your cross-industry skills.</p> <p><em>Andrew Fennell is a recruiter and founder of CV writing service <a href=\"http://standout-cv.com/\">StandOut CV</a>.</em></p> <p><strong>Looking for a job?

  "<p>Labour has insisted on whipping its MPs to vote on Tuesday for legislation that would require newspapers to pay the costs of any claims made against them by victims of phone hacking.</p> <p>The party has imposed a three-line whip in favour of the proposed amendment to the law, which is opposed by all the UK\u2019s major newspaper groups, who say it would erode their freedom to publish.</p> <p>Labour MP Chris Bryant, the former shadow culture secretary who is now a backbencher, is expected to speak for the amendment. He has made no secret of his support for similar legislation proposed following the Leveson inquiry.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Last month, the House of Lords unexpectedly voted for an amendment \u2013 introduced by Lady Hollins, a crossbencher \u2013 to the investigatory powers bill. </p> <p>She called on peers to implement a version of a key recommendation of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/leveson-inquiry\">Leveson inquiry</a> \u2013 that the victims of phone hacking should be protected from paying the costs of bringing their claims against newspapers in the civil courts. Such a move would potentially expose the press to two bills following a claim.</p> <p>The Labour party backed her amendment in the Lords, and peers voted for it by 282 to 180. </p> <p>It is up to the Commons to decide whether to reject the amendment or vote for it to become law. </p> <p>The Hollins provision is similar to section 40 of the 2013 Crime and Courts Act, which proposes that the government can force publishers who are not signed up to a regulatory regime recognised by the royal charter-backed press recognition panel to pay both sides\u2019 costs in libel and privacy cases \u2013 even if they win.</p> <p>Last week Impress, which has a handful of members, won recognition from the panel, bringing the issue to the fore. </p> <p>Many newspapers are members of Ipso, which says it does not want to be recognised, arguing this amounts to statutory regulation. Others, including the Guardian and the Financial Times, handle complaints internally.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s support for the Lords amendment, expected to be augmented by many Liberal Democrat and SNP MPs, could make it difficult for ministers to overturn it in the Commons, where the Conservatives have a majority of only 12. </p> <p>However, neither Theresa May nor the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, are understood to be overly keen on introducing the new costs provision.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Lord Strasburger, the Lib Dem peer whose Twitter biography says he is \u201cfighting too much intrusion into our privacy\u201d, welcomed the prospect of the Commons vote in a tweet he posted on Monday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LordStras/status/793122018577281025\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Govt just failed to stop Lords adding Leveson protection for victims of press abuse.

But what had induced Nissan to stay?<br></p> <p>Breaking with the PM\u2019s edict of not providing a running commentary, Clark delivered a clear signal that No 10 is aiming for a free trade relationship with the EU similar to the single market and customs union:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What I said was that our objective would be to ensure that we would have continued access to the markets in Europe \u2013 and vice versa \u2013 without tariffs and without bureaucratic impediments and that is how we will approach those negotiations.</p> </blockquote> <p>As our colleague <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/30/greg-clark-brexit-negotiations-andrew-marr-show-nissan-auto-industry\">Patrick Wintour noted,</a> Clark\u2019s clear implication was that Britain\u2019s target will be not just to avoid tariff and non-tariff barriers with the EU for carmakers but probably to seek similar deals for other industries in a sector-by-sector approach.</p> <p>The first point about this is that when it comes to the negotiations, part of the government plainly sees access to the EU single market as at least as important as migration controls and ending oversight from the European court of justice. That appears to be at odds with May\u2019s stated priorities.</p> <p>The second is that the logical inference from Clark\u2019s remarks is that he believes Britain should stay in the customs union \u2013 which is not necessarily the view of Liam Fox at the Department for International Trade. </p> <p>The third is that it is by no means clear \u2013 some would say highly unlikely \u2013 that the EU will be open to such sector-by-sector negotiations. </p> <p>And the final point is the potential cost of such an approach, not just in contributions to the EU budget but \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/30/nissans-post-brexit-deal-could-lead-to-colossal-bills-for-taxpayers\">as Nick Clegg pointed out \u2013 in the \u201ccolossal amounts\u201d</a> the taxpayer could end up paying to subsidise a whole series of such deals for different industry sectors.</p> <p>It does all, though, suggest that May\u2019s views on the desirability of remaining in \u2013 or as good as in \u2013 the single market might be closer to the ones she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/26/theresa-may-under-fire-following-leaked-brexit-recording\">revealed privately to Goldman Sachs bankers before the referendum</a> than to those she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/may-on-collision-course-with-backbenchers-seeking-soft-brexit\">trumpeted at the Conservative party conference</a>. </p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s preferred Brexit may be softer than anyone thought \u2013 which could mean trouble ahead from the Brexiters. </p> <h2>The view from Europe</h2> <p>The big news from Brussels last week was that after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/14/eu-canada-free-trade-deal-ceta-in-jeopardy-belgium-wallonia-parliament-vote\">a fortnight of valiant last-gasp resistance</a> from the French-speaking Belgian region of Wallonia, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/30/eu-canada-sign-ceta-free-trade-deal-trudeau-juncker\">the EU and Canada finally got to sign their free trade deal, known as Ceta</a>.</p> <p>The package, which gives the EU its first trade pact with a G7 economy, still has to go before national parliaments, but the EU commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, was delighted: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are setting standards which will determine globalisation in the coming years. Nothing in other trade agreements will be able to remain below the level of what we have reached today with Canada.</p> </blockquote> <p>Although May was at pains to say Britain would not seek to replicate any existing model in its future relationship with the EU, and Juncker saw \u201cno relation between what we are signing today and the Brexit issue\u201d, there were Brexit lessons aplenty in the Ceta saga.</p> <p>Perhaps the most important is that on a continent that seems increasingly sceptical about the value of trade deals, 38 national and regional assemblies will have a final say on the future UK-EU agreement \u2013 and several will seek to use it.</p> <p>As Guillaume Van der Loo, a trade expert at the Centre for European Policy Studies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/29/britain-must-learn-from-the-eu-canada-ceta-trade-deal-saga\">told the Guardian\u2019s Jennifer Rankin</a>, any Brexit trade deal will be political, and Britain will need to meet the concerns of each EU county and region:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Member states are no longer reluctant to put their foot in the door and stop an agreement in order to gain what they want.</p> </blockquote> <p>One of the things France might well want is the end of the Le Touquet treaty under which Britain carries out border checks on French soil. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/25/calais-camp-demolition-begins-charities-call-protection-minors-children-unicef\">the migrant and refugee camp in Calais was finally demolished last week</a>, it is becoming increasingly clear that the future of the treaty could become part of wider Brexit talks. </p> <p>France will be one of the loudest voices calling for a hard line if Britain opts for a hard Brexit. As Alain Jupp\u00e9, the man currently most likely to be the country\u2019s next president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/20/alain-juppe-france-managing-migrants-uk-calais-kent-border\">reminded the Guardian recently</a>, a \u201ccomplete renegotiation\u201d of Le Touquet could well be part of the mix. </p> <h2>Meanwhile, back in Westminster</h2> <p>At least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney\">Bank of England governor Mark Carney</a>, Britain\u2019s most high-profile migrant worker, is going to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/31/mark-carney-extra-year-bank-of-england-governor\">hang around for a year longer than he needed to</a>, until July 2019 \u2013 and he has the full backing of the PM.

All central bankers are replaceable,\u201d said Posen, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee. \u201cIt\u2019s about a government that attacks any disagreement. So they\u2019d put in a stooge.\u201d</p> <p>Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, also rallied to Carney\u2019s defence this week, saying his party would fight to preserve the central bank\u2019s independence.</p> <p>\u201cLabour gave the Bank of England independence to stop Tory chancellors leaving monetary policy to the whims of their backbenchers,\u201d McDonnell said, calling that independence \u201csacrosanct\u201d.</p> <p>His speech also issued new demands for the government not to pursue a sweetheart deal for the City at the expense of manufacturers and small businesses.</p> <p>(Unfortunately for McDonnell, instead of warning of the dangers of a \u201cbankers\u2019 Brexit\u201d, a slip of the tongue saw him rail against a \u201cbankers\u2019 breakfast\u201d, presumably kippers and champagne, which sounds rather delicious.)</p> <h2>You should also know that:</h2> <ul> <li>A high court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/28/belfast-court-rejects-legal-challenges-brexit\">judge in Belfast rejected two of the first legal challenges to Brexit</a>, saying the 1998 Good Friday agreement could not be used to exempt Northern Ireland from the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU.</li> <li>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/uk-economy-defies-brexit-slowdown-fears\">UK economy turned in a better than expected performance</a> after the Brexit vote, growing by 0.5% in the three months to end-September. </li> <li>Britain will need <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/24/sir-simon-fraser-uk-interim-deal-eu-brexit-negotiations-foreign-office-article-50\">an interim EU deal and must accept the EU will exact an economic and political price</a> for Brexit, a former top Foreign Office official said.</li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/28/tony-blair-remain-voters-to-mobilise-against-brexit\">Tony Blair said remain voters should organise their opposition</a> to Brexit, saying: \u201cWe are the insurgents now.\u201d Lots of people said he should shut up. </li> <li>The number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/27/uk-university-applications-from-eu-down-9-ucas\">EU students applying for places on some of the most sought-after courses in the UK\u2019s leading universities</a> has dropped by 9%, Ucas said.</li> </ul> <h2>Read these:</h2> <p>In t<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/30/theresa-may-lie-and-lied-to-become-prime-minister\">he Guardian, Nick Cohen argues that Theresa May lied to get her job as PM</a> \u2013 and is lying to us now, to make us believe she is acting in our best interests whereas she is in fact \u201ca prime minister of pretences\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>She pretends that we should leave the EU, even though she knows we should remain a member of the single market.

  "<p>When Marina Abramovi\u0107 was 14, her father arranged for her to have a painting lesson with the Serbian artist Filo Filipovi\u0107. It wasn\u2019t a particularly straightforward encounter. Filipovi\u0107 began by placing a piece of canvas on the floor of the room the precocious Abramovi\u0107 called her studio. He then covered it with glue, sand and some red, yellow and black pigment. Finally,&#xa0;he poured petrol over it, lit a&#xa0;match, and waited for the inevitable result. Whoosh. \u201cThis is a sunset,\u201d he&#xa0;told her, and promptly left.</p> <p>The experience had a powerful effect on Abramovi\u0107. As she notes in her rawly intimate and weirdly mesmeric memoir, <em>Walk Through Walls</em>: \u201cIt taught me that the process was more important than the result.\u201d Art could be made of anything \u2013 or nothing. For a while, she continued to paint: how else could she hope to graduate from art school? But it wouldn\u2019t be long before she found her true medium. In 1973, when she was in her mid-20s, she staged a piece called <em>Rhythm 10</em> at the Edinburgh festival, in which she recorded herself stabbing 10 knives between each of her fingers as fast as she could. Her task complete, the paper on which her hands rested was impressively stained with blood. Yet her body throbbed, not with pain, but with \u201celectricity\u201d. It was a transformative moment: \u201cThe audience and I had become one. A single organism\u2026 I had become a Marina I didn\u2019t yet know.\u201d</p> <p>Four decades on, and Abramovi\u0107, now the world\u2019s best-known performance artist, knows this Marina all too well. So what is she like? In her book, she tells her ghost writer, the American author James Kaplan, that there are three Marinas. The first is a \u201cwarrior\u201d: brave, determined, and physically strong. The second is a \u201cspiritual\u201d woman who sees dead people, believes in fasting and silence, and likes to consult with shamans. As for the third, this is \u201cthe little Marina who thinks everything she does is wrong, the Marina who\u2019s fat, ugly, and unwanted\u201d. In life, she prefers to keep this Marina from public view; the&#xa0;eager, submissive crowds who gather (so unthinkingly, it sometimes seems) to see her provocations require&#xa0;from her a certain toughness, the sense that she\u2019s in control. But in <em>Walking Through Walls</em>, she allows her&#xa0;to creep forward. The effect is quietly revelatory. On the page, her stoicism takes on her narcissism, and wrestles it to the ground. Suddenly, scepticism at her practice begins to fall&#xa0;away.</p> <p>Abramovi\u0107 grew up in Belgrade, in a grand, book-filled apartment big enough to house the aforementioned childhood studio. Unlike most families, hers did not suffer the privations of communist Yugoslavia; in the war, her parents had fought with Tito\u2019s partisans, and when it was over, they were rewarded with important jobs in the Party. But if they were privileged, they were also wildly unhappy. They loathed one another, and her mother, Danica, was controlling and violent. Even at the age of 24, her daughter was&#xa0;still expected to return home by 10pm. Escape should have presented itself in the form of art school (the Academy of Fine Arts in Belgrade), and&#xa0;an early marriage (to Ne\u0161a Paripovi\u0107, then a fellow student). But Danica\u2019s grip was unshakeable. In consequence, Abramovi\u0107\u2019s rebellions took ever more extreme forms. On one&#xa0;occasion, she smeared the contents of 300 cans of brown shoe polish on the walls and windows of her bedroom and&#xa0;studio. Her mother opened the door, screamed, and never entered again.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Though work is a salve, not even art can stave off a future that is shrinking all the time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Everything changed, however, in 1975, when she met Frank Uwe Laysiepen, AKA <a href=\"http://www.ulay.si/\" title=\"\">Ulay</a>, the German-born artist with whom she would work for the next 12 years. Together, they bought an old Citro\u00ebn police van, and lived an itinerant life, putting on performances wherever they could. An early show, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnV89ZaXomg&amp;feature=youtu.be\" title=\"\"><em>Imponderabilia</em></a> (1977), saw them stark naked at the entrance of a Bologna gallery, where they formed a narrow human gateway through which every visitor had (poor things) to pass. Their relationship was intense and fulfilling, but Ulay was also an inveterate womaniser, and though Abramovi\u0107 tried to harden herself to this \u2013 she describes a menage a trois in which she reluctantly agreed to participate in tortuous detail \u2013 she reached a point where she could take no more. It ended with <em>The Lovers</em> (1988), in which they each walked from opposite ends of the Great Wall of China until at last they met to say goodbye. En route, incidentally, Ulay managed to impregnate his Chinese&#xa0;translator.</p> <p>Newly independent, Abramovi\u0107\u2019s career took off. At the 1997 Venice Biennale, she was awarded the Golden Lion for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbswpr7ibBA\" title=\"\"><em>Balkan Baroque</em></a>, in which she scrubbed cow bones while singing Yugoslav folk songs. But having read of the poverty she endured for so long in the cause of her work, you can almost forgive the excesses that come with her new status: the house in which there is a dedicated room for the drinking of water; the party for her 60th birthday at which cocktails containing her teardrops are served; the \u201cworkshops\u201d with Lady Gaga.</p> <p>Softening the heart, too, is the sense of how alone she is. Of course, this is, to a degree, a chosen state, and a vital one. Her determination to live only for her art led Abramovi\u0107 to have three abortions; when she returns to her star-shaped home in the Hudson Valley&#xa0;after one of her epic feats of endurance \u2013 in 2010, she spent 736 hours at the Museum of Modern Art in New York for <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/72711715\" title=\"\"><em>The Artist Is Present</em></a> \u2013 her isolation is as necessary as air. But reflecting on the end of her second&#xa0;marriage, to the Italian artist Paolo Canevari, she confesses to fearfulness, too. A woman who is 60, she says, faces loneliness in a different way from one who is 40, and though work is a salve, not even art can stave off a future that is shrinking all the time. What did it cost her to say this, let alone to set it down in the pages of a&#xa0;book? My guess is: quite a lot.</p> <p><em>Walk Through Walls: A Memoir is published by Fig Tree (\u00a320). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/walk-through-walls.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to order a copy for \u00a316.40</em></a></p>",

Lightning storms and escapees couldn\u2019t dampen the spirits of the Top End\u2019s Melbourne Cup croc race. On the track - Mr Malcolm, Whinger, Tab, Mongrel, and Handbag. Mongrel and Mr Malcolm won the first two warm ups in an exciting speed-waddle to the outer hay bales. One, perhaps the same who sensed freedom earlier today, attempted a leap over the boundary to no avail.<br></p> <p>Fashion In The Bush, shoes optional, provided halftime entertainment.</p> <p>In the grand final, the wriggling mass of reptiles were held at bay by their Crocodylus Park handler as thunder rumbled overhead. The starting gun sounded, and they were off. Mostly. One needed a hurry up, which a barefooted, fascinator-wearing punter was happy to give, climbing over the bales to give him a nudge. </p> <p>But it was Tab who brought it home for his sponsor, Belinda Harris, from Melbourne. I asked how the race compared to her home town. \u201cAbsolutely loving it,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is awesome.

Horses for courses. See what I did there?</p> <p>Sam continues: \u201cIn the Cup, the Japanese raider will brain them if it runs anywhere near its peak (its previous run at 3200m, in May, would\u2019ve won any Melbourne Cup, EVER). It\u2019s older than Brent Harvey though, so it might also be better suited to eventing. I\u2019m headed to the pub.\u201d</p> <p>Thanks, Sam.

So it\u2019s only fair that I share my own. The preamble to it as having a chip at the PM for his Cup tip. This will all make sense.</p> <p>Mr Turnbull yesterday did what all politicians must and picked his winner. Or, as it happens, two - Bondi Beach for it is in his electorate and Hartnell because it won the Turnbull Stakes. The more cynical among us may say this is reflective of the PM\u2019s predisposition for having several positions on matters of policy. And that he has <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-09-23/turnbulls-roosters-gaffe-has-labor-crowing/519378\">form</a> as well with <a href=\"https://au.sports.yahoo.com/afl/a/32771390/malcolm-turnbull-makes-cringeworthy-afl-grand-final-blunder/\">sport</a>. </p> <p>Anyway, I don\u2019t want to be nasty. All in good fun, Malc. Hope you are having a nice day. </p> <p>So, to my story. </p> <p>In 2009 I was advising the then-PM Rudd on, among other things, sport. So the process was went through and I landed on Shocking. He went on the radio the day before The Cup and backed that in, which was good of him. </p> <p>The next day? Turnbull, opposition leader at the time, took a Newspoll lead over Rudd for the first time. Ever. Indeed, it was the first Newspoll Labor had trailed in since Rudd became leader in 2006, nearly three years earlier.</p> <p>Rudd wasn\u2019t happy with me. Shocking? His horse? On a Newspoll day? What was I thinking? It wasn\u2019t entirely unreasonable, but I did encourage waiting to see how the race went. </p> <p>As we know, Shocking bolted it in. The next phone call moments after the race was from Rudd to thank me for the tip. The political news that night did include the poll, but began with the PM picking the Cup winner for the second time in three years. </p> <p>When I left his office some months later the brief was returned to me as a framed gift that <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/9kUYHVNPKy/\">you can see here</a>. A pretty nice touch.

Caulfield Cup run was pretty sound but 1kg from the top weights for a G1 maiden that has never been past 2400m is a bit much.</p> <p><strong>10 - Gallante:</strong> second to Jameka first up looks OK but nothing of note behind him, forgive Mooney Valley flop, but he\u2019s not up to this.</p> <p><strong>12 - Jameka:</strong> Old school Cup prep, two very good WFA runs to open her up, flogged second-raters in Naturalism, cracking Turnbull run and then a dominant Caulfield Cup win. Not terribly badly weighted after the penalty, nice draw, lots of ticks. My tip.</p> <p><strong>18 - Assign:</strong> This time last year was getting around in a BM90. Form is OK for third-string stayers, but no.</p> <p><strong>19 - Grey Lion:</strong> Solid at Geelong but his best win is a 3YO SWP. If you like Oceanographer and Qewy, I guess you give him a chance.</p> <p><strong>20 - Oceanographer:</strong> I don\u2019t think he beat much on Saturday. It looked impressive but he won\u2019t get that much galloping room against 23 opponents and will see plenty of rump steak before he gets going. He\u2019s progressive but it\u2019d be a bit embarrassing if something like this could come here and win.</p> <p>Jameka for me. Respect the Japanese, as always, but he hasn\u2019t won for three years. Big Orange is class and well weighted for his record, could be the one to break the curse on the hit-and-run raiders. </p> <p>Bondi Beach has only missed a place once, but they don\u2019t often win if they\u2019ve raced in this before. Hartnell isn\u2019t a two-mile horse, lay all day. Don\u2019t care how good Wicklow Brave is, the Butcher is back for his umpteenth poor Cup ride. Almandin is short for mine but can win.

  "<p>In April 2002, Jean-Marie Le Pen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/22/thefarright.france\">stunned all of Europe</a> by defeating the socialist candidate, Lionel Jospin, in the first round of the French presidential election, and advancing to the final round between the top two candidates. Terrified by the prospect of a far-right victory, the French left \u2013 including communists, Greens and the Socialist party \u2013 threw their support behind the incumbent president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jacques-chirac\">Jacques Chirac</a>, a pillar of the centre-right establishment who had served as mayor of Paris for 18 years before becoming president in 1995. This electoral strategy effectively isolated Le Pen\u2019s Front National (FN), depicting it as a cancerous force in the French body politic.</p> <p>Two weeks later, on 5 May, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/06/france.thefarright2\">Chirac won the election</a> with an astronomical 82% of the vote, trouncing Le Pen by the biggest margin in a French presidential election since 1848. Raucous celebrations spilled into the streets of Paris. \u201cWe have gone through a time of serious anxiety for the country \u2013 but tonight France has reaffirmed its attachment to the values of the republic,\u201d <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1969902.stm\">Chirac declared in his victory speech</a>. Then, speaking to the joyous crowds in the Place de la R\u00e9publique, he lauded them for rejecting \u201cintolerance and demagoguery\u201d.</p> <p>But May 2002 was not, in fact, a moment of triumph. Rather it was the dying gasp of an old order, in which the fate of European nations was controlled by large establishment parties.</p> <p>Jean-Marie Le Pen was an easy target for the left, and for establishment figures such as Chirac. He was a political provocateur who appealed as much to antisemites and homophobes as to voters upset about immigration, drawing his support largely from the most reactionary elements of the old Catholic right. In other words, he was a familiar villain \u2013 and his ideology represented an archaic France, a defeated past. Moreover, he did not seriously aim for power, and never really came close to acquiring it; his role was to be a rabble-rouser and to inject his ideas into the national debate.</p> <p>Europe\u2019s new far right is different. From Denmark to the Netherlands to Germany, a new wave of rightwing parties has emerged over the past decade-and-a-half, and they are casting a much wider net than Jean-Marie Le Pen ever attempted to.

Europe\u2019s new far right is poised to transform the continent\u2019s political landscape \u2013 either by winning elections or simply by pulling a besieged political centre so far in its direction that its ideas become the new normal. And when that happens, groups that would never have contemplated voting for a far-right party 10 years ago \u2013 the young, gay people, Jews, feminists \u2013 may join the working-class voters who have already abandoned parties of the left to become the new backbone of the populist right.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>On 6 May 2002, one day after revellers filled the streets of Paris to celebrate Chirac\u2019s historic victory, the flamboyant and iconoclastic leader of the Dutch far right, Pim Fortuyn, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/06/3\">was gunned down</a> by a radical animal rights activist as he emerged from a radio interview. His assassin later claimed that he had killed Fortuyn to stop him from using Muslims as \u201cscapegoats\u201d. In national elections nine days later, Fortuyn\u2019s eponymous party \u2013 the Pim Fortuyn List \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/16/eu.thefarright\">became the second largest in the Netherlands</a> with 17% of the vote.</p> <p>Fortuyn, a former communist and openly gay man who boasted of sleeping with Muslim immigrants while calling for a ban on Muslim immigration, was an electrifying figure in a country known for its staid politics. His time in the limelight was short but transformative.</p> <p>It was Fortuyn who blazed the trail for the new generation of far-right leaders across Europe. He may not have intended to be a pioneer, but his brand of plain-spoken political incorrectness and his depiction of Islamic culture as a \u201cbackwards\u201d and reactionary threat to the hard-won progressive values of western Europe would provide a potent template for a modernised far right. His ideological inheritors in Dutch politics, as well as the revamped Front National in France, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/25/danish-peoples-party-triumphant-in-european-elections\">Danish People\u2019s Party</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/06/afd-leader-frauke-petry-criticised-comparing-migrants-compost-germany\">Germany\u2019s Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland</a> have all emulated Fortuyn in their own ways.</p> <p>Fortuyn proved that the winning argument for the European far right was not a US-style appeal to conservative religious values, but rather to claim it was \u201cdefending secular, progressive culture from the threat of immigration,\u201d argues Merijn Oudenampsen of Tilburg University. The Netherlands was a perfect laboratory for this new strategy because, unlike France, it did not have a strong contingent of religious traditionalists opposed to women\u2019s liberation and gay rights.</p> <p>Before founding his own party in 2002, Fortuyn had tried to join an establishment centre-right party, the People\u2019s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), in the late 1990s. The party\u2019s then-leader, Frits Bolkestein, who had been one of the first figures to speak critically about immigration in the early 1990s, remembers Fortuyn as a talented but inflammatory politician. \u201cHe had a thoroughly theatrical personality, and that played in his favour,\u201d said Bolkestein, now in his 80s, from his office overlooking the canals of Amsterdam. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to be in my parliamentary group, so I cold-shouldered him \u2026 He would have acted as a fragmentation bomb.\u201d</p> <p>Fortuyn took his explosive rhetoric elsewhere and, by creating a new type of far-right politics in progressive garb \u2013 \u201ca form of xenophobia ideally suited to a nation that prides itself on its tolerance,\u201d as <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/09/09/beyond-tolerance\">a New Yorker profile</a> once described it \u2013 he redirected the entire national debate in a way that has endured long after his death.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e498f179bba391b90d276a86cb881e8f9d32ac93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e498f179bba391b90d276a86cb881e8f9d32ac93/128_291_1872_1123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pim Fortuyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pim Fortuyn was an electrifying figure in the Netherlands, a country known for its staid politics.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Nijhuis/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two years after Fortuyn was killed, the Netherlands was traumatised by another political assassination. Early one morning in November 2004, the filmmaker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/07/terrorism.religion\">Theo van Gogh was murdered</a> by a young Dutch-Moroccan, Mohammed Bouyeri, who shot van Gogh eight times, slashed his throat and then pinned a letter to his chest with a knife. The letter was a death threat aimed at the Somali-born Dutch parliamentarian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ayaan-hirsi-ali\">Ayaan Hirsi Ali</a> \u2013 a vocal critic of Islam who was soon placed under the protection of the Dutch security services.</p> <p>The two assassinations shook the Netherlands to its core and catapulted a little-known and theatrically coiffed politician, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/geert-wilders\">Geert Wilders</a>, to popularity as an ideological successor to Fortuyn. Wilders had also flirted with Bolkestein\u2019s VVD, beginning his political career as a staffer in the party office. In late 2004, he split off and formed his own. With Hirsi Ali in hiding, he quickly became the most prominent anti-immigration voice in the country \u2013 and has remained so ever since.</p> <p>For those who cared to look, the political ground had already begun to shift. Six months before Chirac\u2019s trouncing of Le Pen and Fortuyn\u2019s assassination, Denmark had an election. On its surface the result was not a historical watershed; the centre-right Venstre party ousted the Social Democrats, handing power from one establishment party to the other. What had changed was that the Danish People\u2019s Party, which had campaigned on an overtly anti-immigrant platform, took 12% of the vote \u2013 transforming it into a kingmaker in parliament.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/19/danish-peoples-party-dahl-border-controls-election\">Danish People\u2019s party leader demands border crackdown after election success</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unlike France, which revelled in its triumph over the FN, or the Netherlands, where the remains of Fortuyn\u2019s party failed to become a real parliamentary force, the DPP immediately became a serious player with real influence over policy. And it was not only taking votes from the right; it was also attracting disgruntled social democratic voters who felt that their leaders had abandoned them.</p> <p>The DPP had crafted a social and economic policy that was in many ways more socialist than that of the Social Democrats \u2013 promising better health care, better care for the elderly, and more subsidised housing. As the outgoing Social Democratic prime minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen told me in 2002, a few months after his defeat: \u201cThey took a part of our rhetoric and tried to sell it as a new package to the people, and with some success, one may say.\u201d Back then, Naser Khader, a Danish member of parliament who immigrated from Syria as a child, argued that \u201cthe best way to weaken the DPP is to give them influence\u201d. He was wrong.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>The headquarters of the Front National sits on a quiet street in the unassuming Paris suburb of Nanterre, near a car repair shop and a Portuguese restaurant. Only when you approach the grey building with its mostly closed blue shutters do the armed guards come into view. In her modest second-floor office, surrounded by books and a cloud of vape smoke, Marine Le Pen explained earlier this year how she transformed a party previously known for calling the Holocaust a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/06/jean-marie-le-pen-fined-again-dismissing-holocaust-detail\">detail of history</a>\u201d into a genuine contender for the presidency.</p> <p>\u201cVoluntarily or not, he gave ammunition to our adversaries,\u201d Le Pen said of her father. But she insisted that she has now cleaned house. \u201cI fired them all \u2026 all those people who expressed an ideology or held views that I found unacceptable.\u201d</p> <p>Julien Rochedy, a 28-year-old who headed the FN\u2019s youth wing but has since left the party, told me that he believes the changes are real. Whereas the party\u2019s former leader used to pepper his speeches with lines that made Jews\u2019 hair stand on end, today, if someone tells a racist joke within the party, \u201cyou will be attacked straight away,\u201d Rochedy said. \u201cThere is such self-discipline these days. They are so afraid they\u2019ll be accused once again of being antisemitic or racist.\u201d</p> <p>Still, the party\u2019s detractors continue to level the same charges at the FN, which outrages Marine Le Pen. \u201cToday our adversaries no longer have that ammunition, and they repeat on loop\u201d old tropes about fascists and racists. \u201cAt a certain point this argument loses its force,\u201d she continued, \u201cbecause voters see clearly that there\u2019s absolutely nothing in our platform that remotely resembles fascism or racism.\u201d</p> <p>Le Pen has done more than kick out the most blatant racists and antisemites. She has consciously crafted a campaign designed to appeal to voters of the centre and left \u2013 and other constituencies \u2013 who could never have imagined voting for her father\u2019s Front National.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"89bcb82ae9eac10389507825747a4270de85ccdb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89bcb82ae9eac10389507825747a4270de85ccdb/0_242_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Graffiti on a FN campaign office reading \u2018Racism, xenophobia, Marine and co, clear off!\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anti-racist graffiti on a FN campaign office \u2026 but Le Pen claims that \u2018this argument loses its force because voters see clearly that there\u2019s nothing in our platform that resembles fascism or racism\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Pavani/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Le Monde\u2019s Olivier Faye <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2016/04/12/l-attraction-en-hausse-du-front-national-aupres-de-la-communaute-gay_4900269_823448.html\">has written</a>, she is \u201ctrying to erase another image that has stuck to the skin of the FN \u2013 that of homophobia\u201d. And it is working:<strong> </strong>a survey showed that her share of the vote among married gay couples in the 2015 regional elections was over 32% \u2013 up from just 19% in a similar poll from 2012.</p> <p>As Le Pen has filled her inner circle with more and more openly gay advisers and party leaders, she has also made her pitch to Jewish voters more explicit: \u201cFor a lot of French Jews, the FN appears to be the only movement that can defend them from this new antisemitism nourished in the<em> banlieues</em>,\u201d Le Pen told me. \u201cIn a very natural way they have turned toward the FN, because the FN is capable, I think, of protecting them from that.\u201d</p> <p>Among French voters threatened by the country\u2019s new diversity, rejection of a multicultural society increasingly takes the form of longing for a bygone era. And peddling nostalgia is the centrepiece of many new far-right parties across Europe. In France, Marine Le Pen has promised a return to a time when the French had their own currency and monetary policy, when there were fewer mosques and less halal meat, when no one complained about nativity scenes in public buildings, and when French schools promoted a republican ethos of assimilation.</p> <p>\u201cA growing number of French people feel uncomfortable in their own country,\u201d the prominent philosopher, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/09/right-wing-new-reactionaries-stir-up-trouble-among-french-intellectuals\">Alain Finkielkraut</a>, declared in January during <a href=\"http://www.lepoint.fr/chroniques/juppe-finkielkraut-le-grand-debat-du-point-13-01-2016-2009511_2.php\">a debate</a> with the centre-right presidential candidate Alain Jupp\u00e9 \u2013 who has taken a less strident line on Islam and migration than his rival Nicolas Sarkozy. Finkielkraut depicted contemporary France as a country of halal butchers and tea shops filled only with men, pleading that \u201cthe public good isn\u2019t in the clouds, it\u2019s made from tangible things \u2013 the French of Proust and Montaigne \u2026 the Jardin du Luxembourg and the cows of Normandy\u201d.</p> <p>Finkielkraut, a 67-year-old Jewish liberal, is not an admirer of the Front National, but Marine Le Pen\u2019s deliberate appeals to Jews and gay people have given political expression to an argument that he first made more than a decade ago \u2013 that the left, with its indulgence of Islam, poses a greater threat to France than the far right. After Chirac \u201csaved\u201d the republic from Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2002, Finkielkraut watched the celebrations in the streets and warned that the victors were the real danger: \u201cThe future of hate is in their camp and not in the camp of those nostalgic for Vichy,\u201d he wrote, \u201c \u2026 in the camp of the multicultural society and not that of the ethnic nation \u2013 in the camp of respect, not that of rejection.\u201d</p> <p>Fourteen years later, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/why-does-france-keep-getting-attacked\">the terrorist attacks</a> on Charlie Hebdo, the Bataclan and Nice, Finkielkraut is even more certain he was correct. \u201cAnti-racism today frequently serves as a pretext for not seeing the true danger that threatens us,\u201d he told me when we met in his Paris apartment this summer. While he is still no fan of the FN, he believes it has changed and argues that it \u201cshould be resisted, but for what it is today and not what it was in the past, and not in the name of anti-fascism\u201d. The French must, he insisted, \u201cavoid simplistic analogies with the 1930s. We must not mistake what era we live in. Europe doesn\u2019t only have demons; it also has enemies, and it needs to know how to fight those enemies.\u201d</p> <p>He worries that integration has been such a failure that France will have to \u201creconquer\u201d its \u201clost territories\u201d \u2013 by which he means the suburbs surrounding Paris. \u201cIntegrating people is not telling them \u2018You are how you are and we are how we are\u2019 \u2026 Integration means making them an integral part of our civilisation.\u201d And if that doesn\u2019t happen, he warned darkly, \u201cat best we\u2019ll have secession and at worst civil war\u201d. Continued immigration from Muslim countries, he argues, is nothing less than the \u201cplanned demise of Europe\u201d.</p> <p>Across the country, nostalgia for an older, whiter France has become a potent political force. In the southern city of B\u00e9ziers, Mayor Robert M\u00e9nard, a former Trotskyist who cofounded the press freedom group <a href=\"https://rsf.org/en\">Reporters Without Borders</a>, is seeking to place a moratorium on the opening of kebab shops and has renamed a street after one of the French officers who joined a failed coup against De Gaulle in 1961 to prevent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/02/algeria-insurrection-bombings-independence-france\">Algerian independence</a>. M\u00e9nard comes from a family of <em>pieds-noirs</em>, French settlers in Algeria. He regards the Evian accords that ended the Algerian war as a \u201ccapitulation\u201d, and those who tried to preserve French Algeria as heroes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cff0611bde0fba150bc394adf309650b133d88f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cff0611bde0fba150bc394adf309650b133d88f7/0_271_4135_2481/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marine le Pen with young FN supporters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Whereas young Britons overwhelmingly voted to remain in the EU, and the elderly voted to leave, in France it\u2019s the opposite.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Franck Pennant/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This nostalgia has an unmistakable appeal, but not necessarily for the sort of voters one might expect. Whereas young Britons overwhelmingly voted to remain in the EU and the elderly voted to leave, in France it is the opposite. According to Julian Rochedy, the former FN youth leader, appeals to nostalgia work better with the young in France \u2013 who dream of an era they never witnessed \u2013 than with the old, who lived through the era Marine Le Pen promises to restore. It is older voters, Rochedy argues, who are the greatest obstacle to Le Pen\u2019s victory. \u201cThey are afraid of leaving the euro,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are afraid of huge changes.\u201d Rochedy is convinced that the FN will never win simply by fetishising the past. \u201cThey just want to go back 30 years,\u201d he said of his erstwhile colleagues. \u201cIt\u2019s a discourse that doesn\u2019t at all take into account the world as it is and what France has become.\u201d</p> <p>Even if Le Pen cannot win over enough older voters for her to become president, there is one ageing constituency that has already moved significantly to the right \u2013 the former members of what used to be the largest communist party in western Europe.</p> <p>As the French Communist party collapsed, its supporters were left rudderless. According to Andrew Hussey, a Liverpool-born academic who teaches in Paris, the technocratic leaders of the Socialist party \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/14/france-power-elitism-peter-gumbel\">many of them</a> graduates of the ultra-elite Ecole Nationale d\u2019Administration \u2013 \u201care so disconnected from ordinary people\u201d that even former Marxists won\u2019t consider voting for them. Distrustful of the establishment and searching for a state that protects them, many have turned to the FN. \u201cI think you\u2019ve got a big political question here about who looks after you,\u201d Hussey said. \u201cThis is a very communist way of thinking.\u201d</p> <p>Le Pen knows that she is attracting these people. Many of her supporters \u201cused to be socialists, but they aren\u2019t any more\u201d, she told me. Although she prefers to avoid the phrase welfare state \u2013 \u201cThat\u2019s a socialist concept,\u201d she insisted \u2013 Le Pen has appealed directly to this yearning for a large and nurturing state that fights for the common man and not the rich.</p> <p>\u201cI defend fraternity \u2013 the idea that a developed country should be able to provide the poorest with the minimum needed to live with dignity as a human being. The French state no longer does that,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe\u2019re in a world today in which you either defend the interests of the people or the interests of the banks.\u201d And she has seen results. She points to the northern Pas-de-Calais region. \u201cIt was socialist-communist for 80 years,\u201d she says. \u201cI won 45%.\u201d</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>At the same time as Marine Le Pen<strong> was</strong> working to \u201cde-demonise\u201d the FN, the leaders of the Dutch far right successfully seized the mantle of radicalism by positioning itself as the only force that dares to challenge an out-of-touch political establishment, and the only party willing to speak out about what many voters fear: extremist Islam.</p> <p>Geert Wilders and his Party for Freedom (PVV) have surpassed the Dutch Labour party to take up a close second place in polls ahead of the March 2017 election. Last September, Wilders declared that Europe was facing an \u201c<a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-netherlands-idUSKCN0RA0WY20150910\">Islamic invasion</a>\u201d \u2013 the sort of comments that landed him in court this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/31/geert-wilders-trial-throws-netherlands-divisions-in-sharp-relief\">on charges of inciting racial hatred</a>, which he dismisses as an attack on freedom of expression.</p> <p>The presence of \u201cmasses of young men in their 20s with beards singing \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019 across Europe\u201d, Wilders warned at the peak of last year\u2019s refugee crisis, posed a dire threat to \u201cour prosperity, our security, our culture and identity\u201d. Across the country, grassroots groups responded to Wilders\u2019s warning, attempting to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/17/thousands-riot-in-small-dutch-town-over-plan-for-asylum-seeker-centre\">block the resettlement of asylum seekers</a> in their towns. Last October, Klaas Dijkhoff, the deputy minister responsible for refugee resettlement, arrived for a visit to the tiny north-eastern village of Oranje, where the Dutch government had decided to place 700 refugees. Outraged locals blocked the road leading to town, kicked Dijkhoff\u2019s car and tore off its rearview mirrors. A few days later, near Utrecht, an asylum centre was attacked by masked men with smoke bombs and fireworks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cb02d25bd71d105799a7fe9384e3d0015ea45140\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb02d25bd71d105799a7fe9384e3d0015ea45140/0_0_4308_2585/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A 2010 rally in support of Geert Wilders during his trial for inciting racial hatred, with posters reading \u2018Freedom Yes, Islamisation No\u2019 and \u2018Geert is Great\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 2010 rally in support of Geert Wilders during his trial for inciting racial hatred, with posters reading \u2018Freedom Yes, Islamisation No\u2019 and \u2018Geert is Great\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Dejong/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the decade following the assassinations of Fortuyn and Van Gogh, the integration of Muslim immigrants became the most divisive issue in Dutch politics. Suddenly, Turkish and Moroccan-born Dutch citizens became \u201cMuslims\u201d. And as the public debate over Islam and migration grew even more hostile, even the most basic forms of visible religious observance \u2013 wearing the hijab, buying halal meat, fasting during Ramadan \u2013 became politically loaded.</p> <p>The Dutch Labour MP Ahmed Marcouch, who came to the Netherlands from rural Morocco when he was 10, recounted how controversies have erupted everywhere from supermarkets to classrooms. It is a jolt to the traditionally liberal Netherlands when teenage girls tell their male teachers they can\u2019t shake hands, or that they fast and pray while many other Dutch kids are out drinking and having sex. As Marcouch remarked, it runs against everything that Dutch youth culture promotes.</p> <p>Wilders\u2019s PVV has capitalised on this cultural angst by using simple and deliberately brash slogans about immigration, crime, and refugees \u2013 one of his latest memes is simply \u201cDe-Islamise\u201d \u2013 to win over voters who feel that everything familiar to them is slipping away.</p> <p>By framing its anti-migrant politics as a battle against imperious elites and political correctness, the PVV has been able to capitalise on a panoply of grievances, from anger over asylum seekers to Euroscepticism. Meanwhile, many causes of the radical left \u2013 including anti-racism and anti-colonialism \u2013 have now become establishment thinking in the Netherlands. \u201cIdealism has been bureaucratised,\u201d argues the journalist Bas Heijne, who writes a column in the liberal daily newspaper NRC Handelsblad. \u201cAnd when the establishment enforces universalism, you react against it.\u201d That\u2019s why there is such a strong anti-PC tone to the Dutch right: do not tell us what to say, what to celebrate and who we must live next to.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/31/geert-wilders-trial-throws-netherlands-divisions-in-sharp-relief\">Geert Wilders trial throws Netherlands' divisions in sharp relief</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just as Marine Le Pen\u2019s FN has become a huge presence on social media in France, the right is in the midst of colonising the Dutch media. Geen Stijl (\u201cNo Style\u201d), a popular Breitbart-style news site featuring abrasive articles and videos, encourages its best and angriest commenters to visit mainstream news sites and go on the attack. \u201cIt is massively important,\u201d says<strong> </strong>Tilburg University\u2019s Merijn Oudenampsen, \u201clike a social movement\u201d. The site began as a blog dedicated to those who felt politically homeless after Fortuyn\u2019s murder, and has since become a ubiquitous presence in Dutch public debate, with an army of \u201creactors\u201d on Twitter. According to Oudenampsen, some politicians have told him that Geen Stijl is the first site they check in the morning.</p> <p>The right\u2019s newfound media clout has also helped shape what the journalist Kustaw Bessems, from the leftwing Volkskrant newspaper, sees as a new, inverted, form of political correctness. In the old days, he says, there were taboos enforced by the left: badmouth immigrants and \u201cyou were immediately called a racist and extreme right and basically pressured to shut up\u201d. Now, it\u2019s the other way around. \u201cAs soon as you say anything other than \u2018immigration is a problem\u2019 or \u2018Islam is the cause of terrorism\u2019 \u2026 the thought police immediately jump on your neck to correct you.\u201d</p> <p>A Dutch government official who focuses on security issues complained that even as the integration of Muslim immigrants and the threat of radical Islam had become the most heated and polarising issues in the Netherlands, almost none of the feverish public debate was informed by knowledge of Islamism or terrorism. While politicians fan the flames of fear, the official said, \u201cthe economists look for the economic roots of the problem, sociologists look for social causes and the anthropologists try to explain jihadi culture \u2013 but none of them have any idea about theology\u201d. Even scholars of radicalisation tend to study today\u2019s extremists through the historical lens of the European radical left \u2013 which does little to explain what leads a small number of young Muslim men such as Van Gogh\u2019s killer, Mohamed Bouyeri, to devote themselves to the cause of jihad. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to be a Marxist,\u201d the security official quipped. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking hard to be a salafi.\u201d</p> <p>As the perception that the state is helpless to prevent the radicalisation of Muslim teenagers deepens and the fear of terrorism increases, so does the share of voters who are newly receptive to the far right\u2019s tirades about \u201cIslamisation\u201d. These days it is not only anti-migration activists pushing back against the bureaucratised consensus. There are also many disappointed progressives \u2013 the people who saw the cultural victories of the 1960s and 1970s as major battles that had long since been won, making sexual freedom, feminism and gay rights an unquestioned part of Dutch society. Suddenly those old victories seem tenuous. \u201cThere is a sense that, \u2018We are welcoming and then they do this,\u2019 says Bas Heijne. \u201cThey have been terribly let down in their good intentions.\u201d And in such an environment, traditionally leftist constituencies such as gay people and Jews feel threatened \u2013 and some have become reflexively suspicious of Muslims.</p> <p>The stereotype that observant Muslims hate gay men and lesbians has become so entrenched in the Netherlands that neither side can fathom evidence to the contrary. When the Moroccan-born Labour MP Ahmed Marcouch <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/12/07/parades-end-2\">first joined in Amsterdam\u2019s legendary gay pride parade</a>, he was, as he puts it, the \u201cfirst hetero-active Muslim\u201d to participate. The gay community feared violence from extremists; conservative Muslims were baffled and angry. Both groups concluded, \u201cOh, maybe Marcouch is homosexual too,\u201d he says with a laugh. Neither group could imagine a straight Muslim doing what he did.</p> <p>But public displays of solidarity such as Marcouch\u2019s are rare. Among openly gay couples and religious Jews alike, there is a palpable fear of being targeted by homophobic or antisemitic young Muslim men. Much as in France, this fraught atmosphere has made far-right parties seem a palatable option for groups who would never previously have considered voting for them.</p> <p>In Amsterdam earlier this year, I had several meetings with a staunch Jewish supporter of Wilders\u2019s PVV, who insisted on remaining anonymous. He described his own backing for the far right in terms that echoed Alain Finkielkraut. \u201cIt\u2019s an outdated reflex for Jews to always say the problem is the extreme right,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe have new enemies and we need new ideas.\u201d</p> <p>The experience of his own family during the second world war has convinced him that Europe\u2019s capacity for murderous violence is always lurking beneath the surface. \u201cAnne Frank wasn\u2019t betrayed by the Germans,\u201d he argued. \u201cBut by Dutch people. Regular Dutch.\u201d Jews need to find new allies in a new war, he argues, because they will never be safe. \u201cThe trains for the Jews will always come,\u201d he added, ominously. \u201cI\u2019d rather be wrong than be too calm and end up on the trains.\u201d</p> <p>He is not unsympathetic to the plight of European Muslims, and told me that he even sees parallels with the persecution his own family faced. \u201cIf I were a Muslim in Europe at this moment I\u2019d be very uneasy,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIf Europeans regain their manhood, it could be bad. It\u2019s the history of Europe to treat foreigners terribly. We Jews know that.\u201d</p> <p>For that reason, he argues, Muslims should regard Wilders as a lesser evil. \u201cEvery Muslim should be happy Geert Wilders exists. If someone else channelled these hateful feelings it would be much worse,\u201d he told me menacingly. \u201cWilders is civil. He is a democrat. He is not the new Hitler.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>To Frits Bolkestein, who led the Netherlands\u2019 centre-right VVD in the 1990s \u2013 and was briefly Wilders\u2019 boss when he was a young aide in the party office \u2013 the rise of the far right is as much about class as it is about Islam. The Dutch Labour party, he argues, gave up on its working-class base: \u201cThey made a major mistake,\u201d he says of his old rivals, with a tinge of satisfaction. Faced with \u201cthe choice between the foreign-born and the labour classes, they chose the foreign-born \u2026 and they\u2019ve paid for it dearly\u201d. Current polls project that the party will drop from the 36 seats it now holds (out of 150) to just 10.</p> <p>Marcouch concedes that, like the old leftists in France, many former Labour voters now back Wilders. Moreover, he says, they still live in the very neighbourhoods that families such as his own moved into in the 1980s, as many white Dutch families were moving out. \u201cTheir message to the Labour party,\u201d he said, \u201cis: \u2018You ignored us. You let it happen.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The Danish People\u2019s Party has been seeking out such voters for years, and they have masterfully leveraged anti-immigrant sentiment to siphon away the Social Democrats\u2019 traditional base \u2013 people who fear that the \u201cbread will be buttered more thinly\u201d, as the Danish journalist Lars Trier Mogensen puts it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"485d0c998c114015e268653a91c652c962a01076\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/485d0c998c114015e268653a91c652c962a01076/0_0_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kristian Thulesen Dahl, leader of the Danish People\u2019s Party\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kristian Thulesen Dahl, leader of the Danish People\u2019s Party.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Kastrup/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The DPP has effectively combined anti-immigrant rhetoric with a strong pro-welfare message that stresses quality health benefits and good care for the elderly. S\u00f8ren Espersen, the DPP\u2019s deputy leader, doesn\u2019t think that former Social Democrats will ever go back. \u201cWhen one of those takes the step to vote for us, it is a very, very huge step he is taking,\u201d he says of voters who supported the Social Democrats all their lives. \u201cAnd why should he go back? I mean, to come over this first hurdle of voting for us, then he\u2019s done it.\u201d</p> <p>The Social Democrats first began to lose their dominance in and around the major cities in the 1990s, with many of their votes going to the DPP. One of those places is the small satellite town of Herlev, about 10 miles west of Copenhagen. The 41-year-old Social Democratic mayor, Thomas Gyldal Petersen, has lived there all his life, and he is adamant that controlling immigration numbers is the only way to reverse his party\u2019s political misfortunes.</p> <p>For Gyldal Petersen, the key to successful integration is a demographic balance. As soon as a school or housing estate becomes majority immigrant \u2013 or majority unemployed \u2013 he says, problems start to arise. He blames his own party\u2019s leaders: \u201cMayors in the 80s, they were warning, something is going wrong, you have to change.\u201d But the party leadership \u201cshut their eyes\u201d, he says.</p> <p>Then came <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/muhammad-cartoons\">the Muhammad cartoons</a>. In 2005, the editors at Jyllands-Posten, Denmark\u2019s largest newspaper, invited a group of well-known cartoonists to draw the prophet. The initial response was underwhelming, but within a few months \u2013 through a combination of diplomatic pressure, a dismissive response from the Danish government, and a concerted campaign by local imams \u2013 the cartoons became a full-blown crisis, with boycotts of Danish products and violent protests occurring throughout the Middle East. Danes who had never contemplated voting for the DPP now saw their embassies on fire and death threats against some of their best-known journalists. Suddenly, the DPP\u2019s platform was making sense. They had warned that Muslims were extremists in waiting, and now those warnings seemed to come true. Politicians such as Naser Khader, who once warned that giving the DPP influence would weaken them, found themselves moving steadily to the right of the political spectrum. When Khader founded a new organisation called \u201cDemocratic Muslims\u201d in the wake of the cartoon controversy, he received death threats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/26/danish-cartoons-muhammad-politiken-apology\">Danish newspaper apologises in Muhammad cartoons row</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those at the top of the Social Democrats are now taking a tough stance, too. Earlier this year the party leader, Mette Frederiksen, went to Stockholm to meet with fellow Scandinavian social democrats. There she gave a speech that rattled her colleagues. \u201cWe social democrats must accept that there is a clash,\u201d she declared. \u201cIt is a very strong part of our identity that we help when people need help \u2026 but just as strong is our value that we must have a well-functioning welfare state.\u201d Frederiksen continued: \u201cMy position is that a universally funded Scandinavian welfare state with free and equal access to healthcare, education and social subsidies is not compatible with an open immigration policy.\u201d</p> <p>But in its zeal to get tough on migration, Denmark has damaged its international reputation as a bastion of progressivism \u2013 the sort of place that <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/17/politics/bernie-sanders-2016-denmark-democratic-socialism/\">Bernie Sanders liked to mention</a> at campaign rallies. In January, just three months after the refugee crisis peaked, Denmark passed what became known as the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/26/danish-parliament-approves-plan-to-seize-assets-from-refugees\">jewellery law</a>\u201d, which stipulated that any refugees carrying valuables worth more than 10,000 kroner (\u00a31,200) would have them confiscated to fund the cost of accommodating asylum-seekers. Editorial pages and columnists across the world lined up to condemn the law. According to Kenneth Kristensen Berth, a babyfaced MP for the DPP, it was about deterrence. \u201cThe goal was, of course, that we should try to tell people that they should not seek asylum in Denmark,\u201d he said. The jewellery provision was a minor part. \u201cMore important is the fact that many people will be waiting longer for family reunification, like waiting three years,\u201d he added. And it wasn\u2019t just the DPP and government who supported it \u2013 the Social Democrats voted for it, too.</p> <p>Bent Melchior, Denmark\u2019s 87-year-old former chief rabbi, was outraged. He bristled at the suggestion that refugees are rich because they flee with some money in their pockets. He would know: although Denmark is always hailed for saving its Jews during the second world war, it is often forgotten that Danish Jews paid fishermen huge sums to ferry them across to Sweden. Melchior\u2019s family paid the equivalent of \u201calmost a year\u2019s rent of a six-room flat\u201d just for his own passage. \u201cDenmark is not a poor country, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d Melchior says. \u201cThere\u2019s food for everybody here, and even if we get a few tens of thousands more people, there will still be food for everybody.\u201d</p> <p>The road that led a centre-left party to support such a law has been long and tortuous, but the trajectory has been clear. The Scandinavian welfare system has always been premised on solidarity, with everyone paying their fair share and receiving what they deserve. As the country has become more diverse, some of the trust sustaining it has broken down. There has been abuse of the system by immigrants, and there has been even more tabloid fearmongering depicting immigrants as cheats and leeches sucking the system dry. But the larger issue, as the Oxford economist Paul Collier has argued, is the growing unwillingness of natives to subsidise those seen as the foreign poor.</p> <p>Herlev\u2019s mayor does not oppose asylum, but he insists that the numbers have to be capped. \u201cWe have to help refugees, and we have to take refugees to Denmark in a number that we can help. If the balance tips, the welfare society cannot hold together,\u201d Petersen warns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7662fe0c7e25d4f00611391611d0c4f03cfc2d92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7662fe0c7e25d4f00611391611d0c4f03cfc2d92/0_0_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"protest against denmark cartoons in iraq\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When cartoons of the prophet Muhammad in a Danish newspaper led to protests across the world in 2006, the DPP\u2019s anti-Islamic rhetoric gained more traction.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wathiq Khuzaie/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But such balance may only help so much. Aydin Soei, a Danish sociologist and the son of immigrants from Iran, believes there is a larger blind spot in the thinking of the Danish government \u2013 one that native Danes who have never been on the receiving end of the state\u2019s integration policy have failed to see. \u201cA lot of refugees were just parked on social welfare instead of [the state] recognising their education and their skills,\u201d Soei told me, citing the case of his own mother, who arrived in Denmark with a physics degree that was regarded as worthless. \u201cIf your motivation is to create a liberal society where the individual can create a good life for him or herself, then you would have solved this problem years ago,\u201d he argues.</p> <p>Instead the state has effectively provided newcomers with an allowance and keys to an apartment, and ignored them \u2013 assuming that its work was done. The problem, Soei claims, is that there is no political incentive to integrate asylum seekers into the job market. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have consequences for the politicians \u2026 because they don\u2019t have the right to vote.\u201d Either way, it plays into the DPP\u2019s argument. \u201cImmigrants can\u2019t do right,\u201d said Gyldal Petersen. \u201cWhen they\u2019re unemployed they\u2019re a burden to society. When they\u2019re in a job, they just stole the job from a Dane.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Whether or not Marine Le Pen wins next year\u2019s French election or Wilders\u2019 PVV becomes the largest party in the Netherlands, the new far right is not going away. The reflex among many establishment parties \u2013 and media institutions \u2013 has been to dismiss them, sideline them or mock them. Others, however, have begun to mimic them in an effort to win their old voters back.</p> <p>Rhetoric might, in the long run, matter more than election results. When I spoke again recently with the Jewish Wilders supporter from Amsterdam, he was convinced that the battle has in some ways already been won \u2013 regardless of the outcome of next year\u2019s elections. \u201cThe PVV has shifted the whole political discussion to the right. The Labour party is saying almost exactly the same thing Wilders said five years ago,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou can have a lot of influence in politics by steering the debate.\u201d</p> <p>If traditional political parties want to win, they must first abandon the old strategy of marginalising populist movements and instead engage them on the merits \u2013 and flaws \u2013 of their policies and counter their messages of fear.</p> <p>Not least among the lessons of Brexit was that, for millions of disaffected voters, immigration is just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/25/brexit-vote-poor-elite\">one more thing nobody asked them about</a>. This is what makes the issue an especially potent weapon: it combines the resentful energies of nativism, economic instability, and hatred of a remote and unaccountable political elite. And the leaders of the new far right have learned to wield it effectively. They know better than to let themselves be dismissed, as Jean-Marie Le Pen was, as antisemites or racists.<strong> </strong></p> <p>In France, the new majority Marine Le Pen hopes to build is strikingly similar to the coalition that brought the Brexit campaign victory.<strong> </strong>In a park near Calais\u2019 castle-like town hall in May, Samuel and Pascal, activists from a group named Retake Calais, railed against the town\u2019s centre-right mayor. They blamed her for the growth of the sprawling, trash-strewn tent city known as the Jungle, which sat three miles east of the town until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/31/1000-children-left-in-calais-refugee-camp-say-charities\">it was dismantled this month</a>. \u201cThose who govern us are completely against us. The illegals, who aren\u2019t French, can do whatever they want,\u201d they told me. For them, even Marine Le Pen is \u201ctoo soft\u201d.</p> <p>If resettlement programmes take refugees away from Calais to other parts of France, as dozens of buses have in the past week since the destruction of the camp, they would not be any happier. \u201cThey\u2019re sending them to all the little villages in France,\u201d says Samuel.

  "<p>Banging on about Brexit five months after the referendum may be boring to Brexiters who have wrapped themselves in the red, white and blue flag of the \u201cpeople\u2019s will\u201d. But it is such a threat to universities it can\u2019t just be tidied away into a box labelled \u201csummer madness\u201d. The threat comes in three parts. The first can be managed, although with difficulty; the other two are more deadly.</p> <p>First, the threat to the UK\u2019s participation in European research programmes and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/13/government-urged-to-protect-eu-student-exchange-scheme\" title=\"\">student exchange schemes such as Erasmus</a>. The government has given a semi-solid guarantee that research programmes will be protected, up to 2020 at any rate. The future of exchange schemes will depend on the willingness of the UK to contribute to the cost \u2013 and the enthusiasm for paying for a student mobility programme so intimately identified with the rejected \u201cEuropean project\u201d may be limited.</p> <p>Closely related is the future of staff and (non-Erasmus) students from other parts of the EU. Both are crucial. Teachers, and especially researchers, from the EU play a key role in maintaining the UK\u2019s envious position in global league tables, about which we love to brag. Other European students fill deficits in domestic demand, typically in science and engineering.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/video/2016/sep/22/oxford-university-vice-chancellor-research-funding-brexit-audio\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/546aq\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2740607\"            data-video-name=\"Oxford vice chancellor worried about post-Brexit funding \u2013\u00a0audio\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC Radio 4/TODAY \"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e3afe0e4b011f2eb7120d9\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/22/160922radio4richardson_KP-29359875_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/22/160922radio4richardson_KP-29359875.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/22/160922radio4richardson_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/video/2016/sep/22/oxford-university-vice-chancellor-research-funding-brexit-audio\">Oxford vice chancellor worried about post-Brexit funding \u2013\u00a0audio</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It is difficult to see even a Brexit government kicking out established staff from the rest of Europe, or placing significant obstacles in their way. But other EU students are a different matter. They are likely to have to pay international student fees. But, because England already charges its own students the highest fees in the world in public universities, the gap between home (and currently EU) student fees and those paid by international students is much less than in the past \u2013 about \u00a34,000 rather than more than \u00a310,000.</p> <p>The second threat is much deadlier. The UK is now established as a nasty country in the world\u2019s imagination. No amount of flummery from the foreign secretary about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/786617722989846528\" title=\"\">\u201copenness\u201d</a> can cover that up. Nor can rather more honest claims by universities that they are open to all, Europe and the wider world, as evidenced by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-live-results-and-analysis\" title=\"\">remain votes</a> in the referendum in university cities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jun/27/universities-high-price-eu-exit-scientific-capability\">Universities will pay a high price now our future has been voted down | Peter Scott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is difficult to imagine why talented scholars and scientists, and students for that matter, should want to make their careers or study in a country unable to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/rightwing-tabloids-pour-scorn-appearance-child-refugees\" title=\"\">admit a handful of refugee children without a tabloid firestorm</a> demanding dental checks. Even before the referendum our inability to evoke a moral response to global distress worthy of our history was <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/the-government-s-shameful-response-to-the-refugee-crisis-in-four-charts-a6814391.html\" title=\"\">deeply shaming</a>. To Orwell, England was like a family with the wrong members in control \u2013 and so it increasingly seems since the Brexit vote.</p> <p>The image and ethos of a country matter even if, as we must hope by relying on our sense of fair play, the direst consequences are avoided. German universities, probably the world\u2019s best before 1914, took at least three generations to recover their eminence and excellence after the world wars, the Nazis and the Holocaust. In a milder example, during the George W Bush neo-con era US universities lost out to rivals, including the UK.</p> <p>The third threat relates to \u201ctaking back control\u201d, one of the Brexit mantras. The EU has never been good at \u201ccontrol\u201d, as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/21/eu-canada-ceta-trade-deal-meltdown-canadian-minister-walks-out\" title=\"\">veto of the EU-Canada deal by the Walloon parliament in Belgium</a> has demonstrated. Instead, it has a political culture characterised by compromise and consensus. The language of&#xa0;Europe is littered with \u201c-ities\u201d: mutuality, solidarity, subsidiarity \u2026&#xa0;Power is diffused, for historical and cultural reasons we all understand.</p> <p>But this EU culture has always been at odds with that elective dictatorship, the UK constitution. Fundamental principles, entrenched rights, legal scrutiny of political decisions, these had never been the English way (they may see things differently in Scotland); instead we rely on precedent and convention. These have protected the independence of the BBC, the courts \u2013 and the universities.</p> <p>The danger is that Brexit will further empower the strong state of which the prime minister is an admirer. There is no better example than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jun/07/universities-higher-education-bill-award-degrees\" title=\"\">higher education and research bill</a> currently before parliament. Safeguards are being swept aside and conventions ignored, as the secretary of state accumulates unprecedented powers over universities.</p> <p>There will no longer be even the semblance of a buffer body between universities and the state when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/nov/30/hefce-buffer-ministers-universities-higher-education-funding-council-for-england\" title=\"\">Higher Education Funding Council</a> is replaced by the Office for Students. The&#xa0;dual-support system, which distinguishes between core research funding and research council grants, cannot long survive when both come from the same source, UK Research and Innovation (headed by a civil servant not a scientist). Universities can be stripped of their degree-awarding powers by ministerial fiat. A frightening demonstration of who, post-referendum, is \u201ctaking back control\u201d.</p>",

The IRS views cancelled debt in the same light as taxable income - which would normally mean that after the floundering of Trump\u2019s Atlantic City casino business and the subsequent cancellation of hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, Trump would have to pay taxes on that cancelled debt as income:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The strategy - known among tax practitioners as a \u2018stock-for-debt swap\u2019 - relies on mathematical sleight of hand. Say a company can repay only $60 million of a $100 million bank loan. If the bank forgives the remaining $40 million, the company faces a large tax bill because it will have to report that canceled $40 million debt as taxable income.</p> <p>Clever tax lawyers found a way around this inconvenience. The company would simply swap stock for the $40 million in debt it could not repay. This way, it would look as if the entire $100 million loan had been repaid, and presto: There would be no tax bill due for $40 million in canceled debt.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Trump campaign dismissed the Times\u2019 allegations, which are based on documents uncovered during a search of casino bankruptcy filings from the 1990s.</p> <p>\u201cYour e-mail suggests either a fundamental misunderstanding or an intentional misreading of the law,\u201d Trump campaign press secretary Hope Hicks told the New York Times. \u201cYour thesis is a criticism, not just of Mr. Trump, but of all taxpayers who take the time and spend the money to try to comply with the dizzyingly complex and ambiguous tax laws without paying more tax than they owe.

But a number of polling and election law experts cast doubts on the methodology and suggested the process could be a smokescreen for voter intimidation.</p> <p>The Republican nominee has for months warned supporters of a \u201crigged election\u201d and encouraged them to monitor polling areas in cities such as St Louis, Chicago and Philadelphia. The lawsuits, filed by state democratic parties in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Nevada would cover many of the cities Stone said he intended to target.</p> <p>The filings argue that such efforts, along with Trump\u2019s rhetoric, could violate both the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which outlawed discriminatory voting practices in the American south and the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which outlawed intimidation against African American voters.</p> <p>Election law experts said it was unclear whether courts would issue a broad order, as requested in the filings, to simply prevent voter intimidation, but could look in more detail at the temporary restraining order requested against Stone\u2019s exit polling.</p> <p>\u201cIt could be useful in getting the word out about these activities and secondly getting the [Republican state] parties and [Trump] campaign on record saying they will not engage in these activities,\u201d said Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California and whose <a href=\"http://electionlawblog.org/?p=88351\">Election Law blog first reported the lawsuits on Monday</a>.</p> <p>The Republican National Committee has been under a consent decree since the 1981 gubernatorial election in New Jersey when the group sent armed off-duty law enforcement officers to patrol polls in minority neighborhoods. These volunteers wore arm bands that identified them as an unofficial \u201cBallot Security Task Force\u201d and erected posters warning against voting fraud. The RNC dismissed the lawsuit as \u201ccompletely meritless\u201d last week.</p> <p>Stone\u2019s exit pollers, self-titled \u201cvote protectors\u201d, had originally planned to use similar non-official identification badges, until these were removed from the organisation\u2019s website late last week.

Because of security concerns, little information about this time has previously been made public:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>McMullin joined the CIA as a student trainee while an undergraduate at Brigham Young University. He would alternate semesters between the university and training at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va. During that time, he spent a year in Israel and Jordan learning Arabic. He also worked for a refugee resettlement program run by the United Nations.</p> <p>After graduating in 2001, McMullin joined the CIA\u2019s directorate of operations, which runs clandestine missions abroad. He was in a computer training class at Langley headquarters when the 9/11 attacks occurred. After that, McMullin\u2019s 18-month training to be an undercover operative was sped up, and he soon found himself in a southwest Asian country where the U.S. military was deeply engaged in the new war on terror. The specific country remains classified to protect his contacts there.</p> <p>The CIA station chief who supervised McMullin in his first overseas assignment told me that McMullin stood out among all the new case officers because of his insistence on going outside the safe confines of the embassy to meet and develop human- intelligence assets. As a Mormon, McMullin could not indulge in the vices that often help to build such bonds, so he used his piousness and his experience before college as a missionary in Brazil to his advantage.</p> <p>... McMullin served his later years as an undercover officer in Iraq while the U.S. military was battling a brutal Sunni insurgency and collecting intelligence on what was then called al-Qaeda in Iraq but is now the Islamic State. McMullin worked in Iraq until 2010, when the country achieved a degree of stability and the terrorist threat was temporarily minimized.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58177231e4b08d944ba4caa4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T16:37:02.264Z\">4.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">CNN 'completely uncomfortable' with leaked Clinton debate question</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>CNN is \u201ccompletely uncomfortable\u201d with news that acting DNC head Donna Brazile allegedly leaked debate questions to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.</p> <p>CNN spokesperson Lauren Pratapas released a statement on the revelations from today\u2019s latest Wikileaks release of emails supposedly from Clinton campaign chief John Podesta, that show Brazile alerted Clinton that a question on the Flint water crisis would be asked during her debate with Bernie Sanders. </p> <p>Pratapas\u2019 statement reads:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On October 14th, CNN accepted Donna Brazile\u2019s resignation as a CNN contributor.

He had planned to support the government again on its industrial relations bills and the legislation enabling the same-sex marriage plebiscite in the November sittings.</p> <p>Lambert is also a supporter of the ABCC and registered organisations bills.</p> <p>Before Day\u2019s resignation Labor had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/26/coalition-rejects-labors-call-to-do-without-bob-days-senate-vote\">criticised the Coalition for its apparent intention to accept Day\u2019s vote</a> if he stayed on in the Senate, despite Day having described his own position as \u201cuntenable\u201d.</p> <p>On Tuesday Bill Shorten said he was more worried about families and contractors \u201cripped off by his companies\u201d than about Day\u2019s future:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/billshortenmp/status/793249240960991232\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Not as worried about Bob Day&#39;s future as I am about the hundreds of families and contractors who&#39;ve been ripped off by his companies.</p>&mdash; Bill Shorten (@billshortenmp) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/billshortenmp/status/793249240960991232\">November 1, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>In a statement, Family First South Australian chairman and state upper house member Dennis Hood thanked Day for his \u201csubstantial contribution\u201d to the party.</p> <p>But in a press conference in Adelaide, Hood said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d at the time it had taken Day to resign, and it \u201chad not been handled well\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/27/family-first-senator-bob-days-companies-owe-total-of-378m\">Family First senator Bob Day's companies owe total of $37.8m</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said Family First\u2019s state executive would convene as soon as possible to pick a replacement. The replacement must then be approved by the federal executive and be formally endorsed by a joint sitting of the South Australian parliament.</p> <p>A joint sitting requires at least seven days\u2019 notice, meaning a new senator will not be in place by Monday, when federal parliament returns.</p> <p>A spokesman for South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, said: \u201cThe government will not delay this process and will seek to arrange a joint sitting at the earliest available time.\u201d</p> <p>Hood said he expected the process to be complete by 21 November, the start of the final two-week sitting of federal parliament.</p> <p>\u201cIt looks at this stage that Family First won\u2019t be represented for one sitting week of the federal parliament, we\u2019re looking at what is possible in terms of arranging us to have a vote in the absence of having a senator.\u201d</p> <p>Hood said Family First supported the plebiscite and \u201cwould have a view\u201d on the ABCC. \u201cIf I were the prime minister I\u2019d be keen to make sure he had a sense of exactly what our views were on those issues.\u201d</p> <p>Labor will not guarantee a pair, instead considering approaches from the government on a case-by-case basis.

And where transfer arrangements were used, Australia retained the obligation to ensure their wellbeing and to find adequate long-term solutions for those found to be refugees, Albrecht said.</p> <p>The UN\u2019s refugee agency maintains that asylum seekers should have their claims processed in the territory of the state from which asylum is sought or which otherwise has jurisdiction over them. In the case of those now held on Manus Island or Nauru, that would mean processing on Australian soil.</p> <p>There is significant disquiet politically at the government\u2019s proposed bill \u2013 the Labor leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/31/labor-mps-oppose-refugee-ban-despite-leadership-saying-it-will-wait-and-see\">Bill Shorten, described it as \u201cridiculous \u2026 on its face\u201d </a>\u2013 and it may breach Australia\u2019s international legal obligations.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/en-au/3b66c2aa10\">Article 31 of the refugees convention</a> \u2013 to which Australia is a party and legally bound \u2013 prohibits states from imposing any sanction or punishment on an asylum seeker because of the way in which they arrived, or imposing any permanent restriction on movement.</p> <p>\u201cStates shall not impose penalties, on account of their illegal entry or presence, on refugees who \u2026 enter or are present in their territory without authorisation,\u201d the convention states.</p> <p>\u201cStates shall not apply to the movements of such refugees restrictions other than those which are necessary and such restrictions shall only be applied until their status in the country is regularised or they obtain admission into another country.\u201d</p> <p>Greg Barns of the Australian Lawyers Alliance said if the bill were passed it was \u201clikely to be scrutinised critically by the high court\u201d and could be ruled unconstitutional.</p> <p>\u201cThe court has made it clear the government has international obligations and that it is not above the law when it comes to people\u2019s rights. To ban a person simply on the basis of mode of transport might be a step too far.\u201d</p> <p>The government has defended the proposed legislation, with the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, saying the legislation did not breach any of Australia\u2019s international obligations.</p> <p>\u201cThe legal advice is very clear \u2026 there are no constitutional issues here \u2026 and we are absolutely confident in terms of the constitutionality and that we meet our international obligations.</p> <p>Dutton said the new law would enable third-country resettlement. \u201cWe are keen to get people off to third countries if they can\u2019t return to their country of origin,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are working with a number of countries now.</p> <p> \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is if somebody is to go to a third country that they apply for a tourist visa or some other way to circumvent what the government\u2019s policy is by coming back to Australia from that third country.\u201d</p> <p>The proposed legislation is widely seen as a pre-emptive move ahead of an announcement on third-country resettlement options for those held on Manus and Nauru. It would be a legislative instrument to prevent people resettled elsewhere from then applying to come to Australia by another migration channel.</p> <p>Both offshore detention centres have been plagued by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/17/australian-immigration-regime-on-nauru-an-open-air-prison-and-akin-to-torture-says-amnesty\">systemic physical violence and sexual assault of detainees</a>, epidemic rates of mental health damage, and acts of self-harm and suicide, including public self-immolation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-the-lives-of-asylum-seekers-in-detention-detailed-in-a-unique-database-interactive\">The Nauru files: the lives of asylum seekers in detention detailed in a unique database \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Within the upper echelons of the immigration department, it is widely accepted the two offshore islands are unsustainable solutions, and, in the words of one department official \u201cthey are ticking time bombs\u201d, for further acts of self-harm, violence and unrest, unless other options are found.</p> <p>The government is furiously working diplomatic channels to secure a third-country resettlement deal and, internally at least, believes a deal with a new country can be brokered in coming months.</p> <p>Publicly the government maintains that Cambodia is a viable resettlement option for those on Nauru but it is conceded inside the department that the attempt to encourage people to go there has been a catastrophic and costly \u2013 more than $40m \u2013 failure, resettling only one person so far.</p> <p>Ministers have resolutely refused to be drawn on possible resettlement countries, but the US, Canada, the Philippines, New Zealand and Malaysia (which would now be legal after being struck down by the high court in 2012) are those most commonly discussed.</p> <p>But it is understood Australia\u2019s search for a suitable third-country has extended across the globe and it appears likely any deal might need to involve several countries to clear both islands.</p> <p>The rhetoric surrounding the proposed legislation, reinforcing the position that those who arrive by boat will never be allowed into Australia, is seen by the government as vital \u201cmessaging\u201d to potential asylum seekers in the region who might be willing to consider a boat journey to Australia.</p> <p>It is also aimed at those on Nauru and Manus, aimed at encouraging them to accept a third-country resettlement deal when it is offered.</p>",
  "<p>More than a quarter of a million children are at an increased risk of falling behind in their development by the time they reach school because of a chronic shortage of qualified nursery teachers, according to a leading charity.</p> <p>A Save the Children report says an extra 10,000 trained <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/earlyyearseducation\">early years</a> staff are needed if all children are to have access to high-quality pre-school childcare, but many nurseries are struggling to afford qualified teachers and low pay means applications for nursery jobs have dropped dramatically.</p> <p>The report \u2013 Untapped Potential: How England\u2019s Nursery Lottery is Failing Too Many Children \u2013 says children in independent nurseries without an early years teacher are almost 10% less likely to meet the expected levels of development when they start school, compared with children who have a nursery teacher.</p> <p>In 2015-16 half of all three- and four-year-olds in England (more than 280,000 children) attended an independent provider without an early years teacher or equivalent working with them. In some areas, including Shropshire, Hull and the London borough of Newham, fewer than 20% in independent settings had access to a qualified nursery teacher. </p> <p>Without that specialist input, experts say some children are left struggling with basic skills such as speaking in full sentences, using tenses properly and following simple instructions. As a result they can fall behind before they\u2019ve even reached school, and the disadvantage continues throughout their lives, the charity says.</p> <p>Gareth Jenkins, a director at Save the Children said: \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly worrying that so many children in England are at risk of falling behind by the time they start school when we know they don\u2019t have to be.</p> <p>\u201cAs a country, we need to start recognising that if we want to give every child the best chance in life \u2013 no matter what their background \u2013 they must have the support they need to learn, grow and develop in the early years of their lives.</p> <p>\u201cNurseries do an incredible job nurturing our children, but many are struggling to afford and recruit the qualified teachers they need to give children this support and support their workforce with more training and development.\u201d</p> <p>Significant improvements have been made in the quality of provision for young children over the last decade, but Save the Children says progress has stalled and, supported by childcare experts, is calling on the government to reverse the trend by investing in a qualified early years teacher in every independent nursery across the country.</p> <p>Dr <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/dr-elizabeth-kilbey-interview\">Elizabeth Kilbey</a>, clinical psychologist on Channel 4\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/feb/11/secret-life-of-four-year-olds-review\">Secret Life of Four-Year-Olds</a> said having an early years teacher in nursery could make all the difference to a child\u2019s future.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that during the early years a child\u2019s brain is developing at its quickest rate, and that language and communication skills are the building blocks for everything else they will learn, including subjects like maths and sciences.</p> <p>\u201cBut crucially, it also gives children the tools they need to build their self-esteem and confidence, and develop positive relationships with everyone around them. Sadly, so many nurseries are struggling to afford to hire qualified teachers, and until they can, children will continue to slip through the net.\u201d</p> <p>The Save the Children report also claims that the number of people applying for nursery teaching roles dropped to 860 last year from more than 2,300 the year before. A combination of low pay and few promotion opportunities, in the context of a shrinking number of available jobs, is thought to be contributing to the decline in interest.</p> <p>A Department for Education spokesperson said 16,000 specialist early years graduates had been trained to date and a record number of providers were now rated good or outstanding by schools watchdog Ofsted.</p> <p>\u201cWe are developing a workforce strategy that aims to remove the barriers to attracting, retaining and developing great people and we will be investing a record \u00a36bn in childcare by the end of this parliament. This is backed up by the fairer funding system we are introducing for early years providers, so that money goes to the areas that need it most.\u201d</p>"
