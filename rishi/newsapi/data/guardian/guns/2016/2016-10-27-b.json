  "<p>A jury has found that brothers Ammon and Ryan Bundy were not guilty of conspiring against the government, a surprising end to the high-profile Oregon standoff trial that sparked national debates about public lands and the rights of ranchers in the American west. </p> <p>The decision, unveiled in federal court in Portland on Thursday, is a blow to the US government, which had aggressively prosecuted the rightwing activists who led an armed takeover of public property to protest American land-use regulations.</p> <p>The Bundy brothers, who orchestrated a 2 January takeover of the Malheur national wildlife refuge, were acquitted on a number of serious charges, along with five other defendants. Only a day earlier the court dismissed a juror over fears of bias, raising concerns that the trial would drag on for weeks.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe are just so excited,\u201d Angie Bundy, Ryan\u2019s wife, told the Guardian after the verdict was announced. \u201cWe\u2019ve been praying hard, and we knew they hadn\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement, federal officials said they accepted the decision. \u201cAlthough we are extremely disappointed in the verdict, we respect the court and the role of the jury in the American judicial system,\u201d said Greg Bretzing, special agent in charge of the FBI in Oregon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/oregon-militia-standoff-bundy-family\">Rebel cowboys: how the Bundy family sparked a new battle for the American west</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Bundy family\u2019s public fight with the government began in 2014 when the patriarch Cliven, now 70, led an <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/19/nevada-armed-militia-cliven-bundy-victory-federal-government\">armed standoff</a> with hundreds of supporters against law enforcement officials at his desert ranch in Nevada, over his refusal <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/01/cliven-bundy-standoff-grazing-rights-nevada-ranch\">to pay grazing taxes</a>.

It\u2019s a lacerating performance \u2013 his young pope is brutally calculating, occasionally almost charming and never less than terrifying. Seeing him eviscerate, in casual, leisurely fashion, anyone who fails to serve his needs \u2013 from the ageing nun who has waited on three pontiffs and presumes to kiss his forehead to the Prefect for the Congregation of the Clergy \u2013 is to watch the devil at work.</p> <p>We\u2019re now at the penultimate episode of the third series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-fall\"><strong>The Fall</strong></a> (BBC2).

Those who know him best acknowledge he is an impressive coup.</p> <p>\u201cI think they\u2019ll be very strong, a very tough side to beat, especially with Wayne taking over,\u201d says the Australia full-back Greg Inglis. \u201cHe gets that extra 1% out of his teams, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll bring that to England.\u201d His coach, Mal Meninga, agrees with him: \u201cWith Wayne at the helm, they are dangerous.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/28/mal-meninga-and-wayne-bennett-best-of-enemies-set-for-four-nations-showdown\">Mal Meninga and Wayne Bennett: best of enemies set for Four Nations showdown | John Davidson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bennett\u2019s experience will undoubtedly be crucial, but the talent he has at his disposal \u2013 this is potentially England\u2019s most gifted squad in a generation \u2013 makes success all the more possible.</p> <p>However the world\u2019s top two \u2013 New Zealand and Australia \u2013 arrive with points to prove of their own. For the latter, there is the goal of reclaiming first place in the world rankings before next year\u2019s World Cup, having surrendered it to the Kiwis 18 months ago.</p> <p>Their travelling squad has the usual raft of big names but there is also a youthful, exuberant look to their team this year, with burgeoning talents like Valentine Holmes and Josh Mansour bona fide Kangaroo superstars in waiting.</p> <p>\u201cWe have the motivation that winning this takes us back to being No1,\u201d says Inglis. \u201cIt\u2019s been spoken about but not too much. This is a great squad we\u2019ve got, there\u2019s some real battles for all the jerseys that are on offer. It\u2019s a new-look group and one I\u2019m excited to play with.\u201d</p> <p>New Zealand, for their part, know they can be usurped at the top this autumn. In their past five Tests \u2013 three of which have been played against England, two against Australia \u2013 they have won only once, a 9-2 victory over England. Meanwhile, their record in England over the past decade is poor, with their last tournament victory on British soil the 2005 Tri-Nations.</p> <p>That form, according to the Kiwis\u2019 half-back Thomas Leuluai, has to change. \u201cWe haven\u2019t performed well over here for a long time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s something&#xa0;that we\u2019ve been angry about, coming over here and not playing well. It\u2019s over 10 years since we\u2019ve won something here, we haven\u2019t produced that form since and that\u2019s something we need to change.\u201d</p> <p>Scotland\u2019s squad is possibly as strong&#xa0;as it has ever been but with a mixture of full and part-time players,&#xa0;their expectations are more tempered than the leading trio as they&#xa0;look to build for next year\u2019s World&#xa0;Cup.</p> <p>\u201cSuccess would be us doing the best we can, being competitive in every game and coming away with our heads held high and putting Scottish rugby league on the map,\u201d says the Scotland wing Dave Scott.</p> <p>It means that, three years on from coming so desperately close to reaching the World Cup final, England are perhaps better placed than ever to trouble the status quo at the top of international rugby league.</p> <p>Quite what victory at Anfield next month would do for the profile of the sport in this country is anyone\u2019s guess but it would go a long way to proving that lifting the World Cup next year is not as far-fetched a possibility as it once was \u2013 particularly with Burgess, Bennett et al involved.</p>",
  "<p>Uber\u2019s eyes are on a new prize: flying cars. </p> <p>Outlined in a <a href=\"https://www.uber.com/elevate.pdf\">white paper</a> published this week, the company\u2019s chief product officer, Jeff Holden, describes a network of small, electric aircraft that can take-off and land vertically (VTOL, or vertical take-off and landing, aircraft) to enable speedy and reliable commuting that it claims will ease congestion in cities.</p> <p>Uber doesn\u2019t plan to build any of these \u201cflying cars\u201d, but has produced a plan called Elevate to set out what needs to be done for the dozens of companies that are building them, including Terrafugia, AeroMobil, Moller International and Pal-V.</p> <p>It\u2019s a little like how Elon Musk bequeathed to the world his idea for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/12/elon-musk-unveils-hyperloop-transport\">Hyperloop</a> transport system, which two independent companies are battling to implement.</p> <p>\u201cOn-demand aviation has the potential to radically improve urban mobility, giving people back time lost in their daily commutes,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.uber.com/elevate.pdf\">the paper</a>, which points out that an average San Francisco resident spends 230 hours commuting between work and home each year. \u201cThat\u2019s half a million hours of productivity lost every single day.\u201d</p> <p>In cities such as Los Angeles and Sydney the problem is even more acute, with residents spending seven weeks each year commuting \u2013 two of which are in gridlock \u2013 while in Mumbai the average commute takes 90 minutes. </p> <p>\u201cFor all of us, that\u2019s less time with family, less time at work growing our economies, more money spent on fuel \u2013 and a marked increase in our stress levels,\u201d says Uber\u2019s report.</p> <p>Uber argues that it will be cheaper to build infrastructure for a network of flying cars than it would be to build roads, railways and bridges, as mini airports \u2013 called vertiports \u2013 could be built on top of buildings. Moreover, the aircraft wouldn\u2019t have to follow fixed routes, which should eliminate bottlenecks caused on the ground by single accidents or roadworks.</p> <p>It\u2019s not entirely altruistic. Once enough of these vehicles exist, Uber could then use its network to connect those vehicles with paying passengers and use software to plan the optimal route from A to B \u2013 for a fee. </p> <p>Not everyone is convinced by Uber\u2019s grand plan.</p> <p>\u201cThe paper is good, it goes over all the details, but they have underestimated the certification process and air traffic control,\u201d said Colin Snow, CEO of Skylogic Research, which specializes in unmanned aerial systems.</p> <p>He points out that aeronautical engineer Molton Taylor had the same vision in the 1940s, proposing something called the Aerocar. \u201cThis is the Silicon Valley version of that,\u201d he said. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Erj_mz30SDI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Erj_mz30SDI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Molton Taylor had the same idea in 1949</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cAviation is highly regulated and gets more complex as time goes on. The assumption that technology will somehow fix the problem is hubris,\u201d he said, pointing out that it took 10 years of negotiations with the Federal Aviation Authority to create regulation for small drones. </p> <p>Snow isn\u2019t the only one to detect the hubris. Bhaskar Chakravorti, an economics scholar from Tufts University, added: \u201cWe see this hubris over and over again, like when Uber went to China \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/06/uber-chinese-deal-ride-sharing-india-taxis\">look what happened</a>. It\u2019s all about how big and mighty they are and what their strategic intent is, but ultimately they are feeding their egos.\u201d</p> <p>Uber\u2019s posturing could help build excitement and momentum for the brand to encourage more people to use the company\u2019s \u201cvanilla car-sharing\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cLook at Google. It goes into all kinds of experiments that don\u2019t make any money largely because there\u2019s a brand halo that keeps people attached to Google\u2019s search engine and Gmail for the ad revenue,\u201d said Chakravorti.</p> <p>However, in the past few years there has been a renewed interest in personal aviation from those who made their millions from social networks and search engines. Google\u2019s Larry Page, for example, has invested in <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-09/welcome-to-larry-page-s-secret-flying-car-factories\">two flying car startups</a>, Zee Aero and Kitty Hawk.</p> <p>In some ways, the flying car is a metaphor for a future where all our needs are taken care of by technology. </p> <p>\u201cWe grew up watching the Jetsons so flying cars are part of a vision of the future where our lives are made so much easier through a combination of seamless transportation and automation,\u201d said Chakravorti. </p> <p>That utopian vision has been combined with a very personal pain point for entrepreneurs like Uber CEO Travis Kalanick: no matter how successful you are, you still have to spend time sitting in traffic.</p> <p>The result? A lot of clever people and money are gravitating towards solutions to that problem, whether through developing cars that drive themselves or take to the air. </p> <p>\u201cIt comes from trying to solve a personal problem and then externalizing it,\u201d Chakravorti said. \u201cThis obsession with flying cars takes the intellectual and financial capital away from the real problems that need to be solved.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>This week, the prolific film-maker Werner Herzog has also released a Netflix documentary called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/21/into-the-inferno-review-werner-herzog-peers-into-the-depths-of-the-volcano\">Into the Inferno</a>, about the terrible might of active volcanoes. Here is his second new film this year (there\u2019s a third to come, called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/13/salt-and-fire-review-werner-herzog\">Salt and Fire</a>). It\u2019s another catastrophist study of a colossal force that is indifferent to humans\u2019 puny and irrelevant moral judgement. His subject is the internet and our new world of digital interconnectivity, and he takes a sombre, quite censorious line.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/24/werner-herzog-lo-and-behold-into-the-inferno\">Savage kingdoms: Werner Herzog takes us from the Earth\u2019s core into cyberspace</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The first crudely web-linked computer at UCLA whirred into life in 1969, and is still kept in the university\u2019s computer science department. \u201cThe corridors here look <em>repulsive </em>\u2026 \u201d growls Herzog, a little bafflingly. They just look like bland, functional corridors. But it was there that the computer sent the first two letters of \u201clog on\u201d before halting. Herzog suggests the resulting \u201clo \u2026 \u201d is a serendipitous cry, as in \u201c \u2026 and behold!\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a second industrial revolution, which has been achieved without the pollution of the first \u2013 but which might have created dark, satanic mills of the mind. It has unlocked huge reserves of creative energy, revolutionised communication, democratised the means of publication, enabled amazing feats of crowdsourced knowledge and dazzlingly speedy analysis. But it has also legitimised hatred and abuse, created poisonously addictive narcissism, and encouraged companies and nation states to entrust vital services to digital control and remote management, leaving them horribly vulnerable to hacking, vandalism and natural disasters that, in an analogue age, would have caused only local difficulty. Herzog\u2019s inimitable, rasping voice runs through all these scenarios off-camera. Somehow it\u2019s the bad stuff that seems to get his juices pumping.</p> <p> Inevitably, he cites the great New Yorker cartoon: \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog\">On the internet, no one can tell you\u2019re a dog</a>.\u201d Anonymity is the great, dark force of the web: it abolishes status and respect. Dog and human are as one \u2013 sort of. Herzog interviews a mother and father who were psychologically torn apart when trolls circulated sickening photographs of their daughter, who had been killed in a car accident. It\u2019s an ordeal that would not have existed before the web. (However, Herzog neglects to mention citizen journalists who can call the mighty to account by taking and sharing pictures and videos. It\u2019s been very important for the #blacklivesmatter movement.) The other dog-equals-man aspect of the internet is cyberwarfare. Small countries can attack Goliath superpowers on almost equal terms. It\u2019s an interesting, disturbing concept, not touched upon in Alex Gibney\u2019s cyberwarfare documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/17/zero-days-review-malware-cyberwar-berlin-film-festival\">Zero Days</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc1tZ8JsZvg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Zc1tZ8JsZvg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p> Herzog addresses the subject of internet addiction, and speaks to web rehab specialists, and former obsessive gamers who are in recovery. The movie at this stage reminded me in some ways of Beeban Kidron\u2019s 2013 film about web addiction, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/22/in-real-life-film-review-kermode\">InRealLife</a>, although Herzog does not take Kidron\u2019s bolder tack of finding the positives in our web-orientated life, and avoiding the obviously supercilious tack of affecting to be deeply concerned by the web while in actual fact being as utterly dependent on it as everyone else. The other trick I think Herzog misses is the relatively recent invention of the smartphone, which overnight made our web-dependence all but total. I couldn\u2019t help remembering the episode of Josh Widdicombe\u2019s BBC3 sitcom, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/dec/02/josh-widdicombe-landlords\">Josh</a>, in which his flatmate Kate has to wait in all day for her new phone to be delivered; when a powercut makes the TV useless, she goes quickly insane, as she realises she has lost the ability to amuse herself by thinking or reading a book.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/16/werner-herzog-lo-and-behold-film-lessons\">Trolls, Terminator and telepathic Tinder: five lessons from Werner Herzog's new film</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Herzog is on firmer ground when he ruminates on the nature of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/artificialintelligenceai\">artificial intelligence</a>. He musingly cites Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz\u2019s comment that war can dream of itself, and asks if the web can dream of itself \u2013 also bringing in Philip K Dick\u2019s great title <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/29/do-androids-dream-electric-dick-review\">Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</a> The answer seems to be: yes, the internet does dream of itself \u2013 in the form of Tim Berners-Lee\u2019s world wide web. These sites make up the endlessly morphing, proliferating, interreacting dreamscape of humanity\u2019s hive mind. Each site, each page and each meme is a pixel of the web\u2019s unconscious.</p> <p>This is a thorough, thoughtful piece of work from Herzog, but slightly ho-hum in its fence-sitting tendencies: I actually think Kidron\u2019s film is clearer and more satisfying in its way. The web could be good, could be bad, could revolutionise consciousness and identity, or maybe not. Sometimes it is as if the film is stymied by the very importance on which it had insisted from the beginning. It is very much a reverie: something more wakeful might have been better.</p>",

  "<p>When Sandy Emerson sat down in her portfolio manager\u2019s office two years ago and announced she wanted to divest from fossil fuels, the latter furrowed her brow and said: \u201cWhy would you want to do that?\u201d Emerson, a 68-year-old Berkeley, California resident, explained her unease about owning shares in companies that contribute to climate change and began selling her stock.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/12/carbon-free-plants-nuclear-energy-future-power-state-sources\">Can our need for a carbon-free future override our fears of nuclear energy?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a result, Emerson has been paying closer attention to the ups and downs in the oil industry and the growing public discussions about the future of fossil fuel use. \u201cI\u2019ve become aware of the financial implications it has for me,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Emerson is among a growing number of investors who see global warming not only as a looming environmental problem but also an investment risk. Some fund managers are ringing alarm bells as well. BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager with almost $5tn in assets,<a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/investing/insights/blackrock-investment-institute/climate-change\"> issued a report</a> last month recommending investors include climate risks in their decisions.</p> <p>\u201cInvestors can no longer ignore climate change. Some may question the science behind it, but all are faced with a swelling tide of climate-related regulations and technological disruption,\u201d the 16-page report said.</p> <p>Even before BlackRock\u2019s report, evidence was mounting that investing in companies with a low carbon footprint pays off. The MSCI Low Carbon Target Index, for example, has modestly outperformed its traditional counterpart since 2010,<a href=\"https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/c64f0873-5818-4304-aaf2-df19d42ae47a\"> data from the index provider</a> shows. Earlier this year, Morningstar issued a rating system to help investors evaluate the environmental, social and governance factors of funds.</p> <p>The bottom line: the financial risks posed by climate change could make an ugly dent in your retirement savings if you don\u2019t pay attention.</p> <p>For middle-class investors, the office worker in Illinois with a company 401k or the teacher in Oklahoma with a state-sponsored pension, the risk could be particularly acute because they don\u2019t oversee their own investments. And attitudes and expertise regarding climate risk vary widely among those charged with investing average folks\u2019 money.</p> <p>In a survey of portfolio managers and analysts done by the London-based CFA Institute last year, 73% said they consider environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk factors in their analysis \u2013 but only 40% of those regarded climate change as important. Moreover, only half of those who consider ESG risks said their firm provided training in this area, with most of that training done via miscellaneous sources such as research papers and conferences.</p> <p>Efforts have begun to create industry-specific standards for companies to disclose climate change risks, most notably by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), a nonprofit group chaired by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The board <a href=\"http://using.sasb.org/sasb-climate-risk-framework/\">estimates that significant climate risks \u2013 things like how severe weather events can impact businesses, regulations imposing a cost on carbon and economic development that is less reliant on fossil fuels \u2013 exist for most of the companies it tracks</a>, which represent $27.5tn, or 93%, of US stocks as measured by market value.</p> <p>\u201cDue to the ubiquity of climate risk, investors can\u2019t simply diversify away from it; instead they must focus on managing it \u2013 and on encouraging portfolio companies to manage it \u2013 in all its forms,\u201d the SASB writes.</p> <p>The future of fossil fuel companies is at risk as more investors move their money elsewhere. By some estimates, the industry could face a \u201ccarbon bubble\u201d that will leave it stuck with trillions of dollars in stranded assets \u2013 unburnable oil, coal and gas reserves \u2013 as nations move to limit the planet\u2019s warming trend to 2C, the target of the Paris climate agreement, which takes effect 4 November.</p> <p>But climate risk doesn\u2019t only affect the big oil. Industries ranging from automobiles to agriculture to steel to utilities could also face climate-related challenges such as sea level rise and drought, tightening emissions standards, changing consumer preferences and the growing divestment movement, the BlackRock report notes.</p> <p>New technology that emerges as a response to climate change could also force changes within industries with a heavy carbon footprint, the report says. For example, advancements and falling prices in lithium batteries are poised to impact both the oil and gas and automotive industries because they are making electric vehicles and battery storage for solar or wind energy more practical and affordable. Earlier this year, Bloomberg New Energy Finance reported that <a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/press-releases/electric-shared-autonomous-vehicles-will-revolutionise-transport-worlds-cities-next-15-years/\">battery prices have declined</a> by 65% since 2010, with 35% of that in 2015. The market research firm projects another 35% decline for 2016, a spokeswoman says.</p> <p>\u201cYou can lose a lot of money by having exposure to losing strategies, losses that could be hard to make up,\u201d says Ewen Watt, senior director of the BlackRock Investment Institute. \u201cIf you\u2019re saving money for your long term future, the risk for you is there won\u2019t be enough money when you retire to meet your retirement needs.\u201d</p> <p>While the financial industry is recognizing climate risks, its actions sometimes don\u2019t reflect that. Banks have continued to fund the dirtiest fossil fuel projects and big fund managers have voted against shareholder proposals forcing companies to disclose their climate risks.</p> <p>BlackRock, along with peers Invesco, BNY Mellon and Vanguard, voted against such shareholder proposals at Exxon Mobile and Chevron earlier this year. BlackRock argues that global warming has yet to harm these oil companies, so it prefers to continue putting money in them and pushing for change from within rather than getting involved in a confrontation. Sandy Emerson\u2019s wealth management firm also advocated this strategy.</p> <p>The federal government has taken conflicting approaches to hold oil companies accountable for disclosing climate risks. Earlier this summer, the House of Representatives passed legislation that would block the Securities and Exchange Commission from implementing climate disclosure guidance. Proposed by Representative Bill Posey, a Republican from Florida, the measure now awaits a vote by the Senate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/16/safer-small-nuclear-reactors-power-plant-technology\">This new technology could save the troubled nuclear power industry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Regular folks might end up being the biggest losers in this fight among regulators, fund managers and fossil fuel companies over their roles in addressing global warming. Consumers who depend on investment professionals to protect their retirement savings may not entrust their hard-earned money with the right people.</p> <p>\u201cIf what you read about stranded assets is true, it\u2019s a potentially serious problem for regular, middle-class people who aren\u2019t necessarily paying attention,\u201d says Cari Rudd, a Washington DC-based communications consultant, who does social media work for Divest-Invest and sits on the board of As You Sow, an Oakland, California-based nonprofit that promotes environmental and social corporate responsibility through shareholder advocacy.</p> <p>\u201cNow that I have become involved, I\u2019m much more concerned about Joe in Cleveland who has a little 401k and how he\u2019s already been screwed on a lot of fronts,\u201d Rudd says.</p> <p>The emergence of divestment advocacy groups is providing more information to help individuals navigate what can be a daunting process of moving their investments to, say, environmentally friendly technology such as renewable energy. Some investment companies offer fossil-free mutual funds.</p> <p>For example, <a href=\"https://fossilfreefunds.org/\">As You Sow\u2019s Fossil Free Funds</a>, which uses data from Morningstar, is a free online tool that allows investors to type in the name or ticker of a fund and see what percentage is invested in fossil fuels. Earlier this month, the organization expanded Fossil Free Funds to include a feature that shows each fund\u2019s carbon footprint and which companies are the main contributors. For 401k participants who don\u2019t have direct control of selecting the funds offered in their retirement plan, As You Sow also provides advice on how to speak to their employers about expanding their company\u2019s plan to include low-carbon options.</p> <p>Looking ahead, Sandy Emerson says she\u2019s been impressed with the handful of largely European oil producers developing small renewable energy divisions.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m watching the oil companies that are starting to make moves in renewables and I\u2019m thinking that they\u2019re pretty smart,\u201d she says.</p>",

  "<p>Teams from a Chinese oil and gas company exploring in the remote Bolivian Amazon have reportedly had near encounters with a group of indigenous people living in what the United Nations calls \u201cisolation\u201d, raising major concern for the group\u2019s welfare. </p> <p>The company doing the exploring, BGP Bolivia, is ultimately a subsidiary of the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), one of the biggest oil and gas companies in the world. The near encounters are reported to have taken place in the north-west of the country, close to the border with Peru and just to the east of the world-famous Madidi National Park.<br></p> <p>One near encounter has been confirmed in a BGP report dated 17 September. It includes hand-written statements by three eyewitnesses - all Bolivian nationals - as well as photographs of evidence provided by two BGP teams believed to confirm the isolated group\u2019s existence.</p> <p>\u201cPersonnel from the team called Topografia 10 reported the presence of possible members of <em>originarios</em> indigenous people shouting and calling out. . . initially about 100 metres away,\u201d states the report, written by BGP\u2019s Yu Fengbo and Alfredo Salvador and dated the same day as the encounter. \u201cAfterwards, the three workers reported that they continued to hear shouts and calls, getting increasingly closer until they were about 80 metres away and it became clear they were men and women. . . Their immediate reaction was to stay calm in order not to be detected.

According to the report, Topografia 3 \u201creported the presence of possible members of <em>originarios</em> indigenous peoples\u201d sometime between 23:00 on 18 September and very early morning of 19 September near a fly camp and helicopter landing area, where some company belongings were attacked.</p> <p>Yet further evidence of indigenous people in \u201cisolation\u201d has been reported as a result of BGP\u2019s operations - although it isn\u2019t included in either of the company\u2019s 17 or 19 September reports. On 14 September, the Central de Comunidades Indigenas Tacana II Rio Madre de Dios (CITRMD), an organization representing indigenous Tacana people, wrote to Bolivia\u2019s Vice-Ministry of Justice and Vice-Ministry of the Environment, among others, urgently requesting government intervention and expressing \u201cserious concern\u201d about the threats posed by the company.</p> <p>According to the CITRMD, evidence for \u201cuncontacted\u201d indigenous people - \u201cfootprints and broken branches\u201d - had been found by Cuadrilla 7, another BGP team, on 20 and 23 August. In addition, the CITRMD alleges further evidence was found by Topografia 10 on 13 September, although BGP\u2019s 17 September report says that team found nothing on that day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e620c4d24f5f092581c10fbbe11d9d1eb2add0d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e620c4d24f5f092581c10fbbe11d9d1eb2add0d1/0_0_2170_1222/1000.png\" alt=\"Do\u00f1a Teo, an indigenous Tacana woman who has expressed serious concern about BGP\u2019s operations in Bolivia.

The response from the team\u2019s colleague, Diego Rivas, is to continue working but withdraw if they see anyone.</p> <p>The CITRMD also wrote to BGP, accusing it of failing to heed a 2013 Bolivian law specifically intended to protect indigenous peoples who are \u201cuncontacted\u201d or in \u201cvoluntary isolation\u201d, \u201cforced isolation\u201d, \u201cinitial contact\u201d and \u201cdanger of extinction.\u201d BGP\u2019s response, in its 17 September report, was that the law did not apply at that point because, although some evidence had been found on 12 September, it wasn\u2019t enough to definitely indicate the existence of isolated indigenous people in the region. Despite that, BGP states that it began withdrawing its teams that day, and then took \u201cmore serious\u201d action five days later after the 17 September encounter was reported. </p> <p>The following day, 18 September, the CITRMD wrote to several indigenous organisations stating that Yacimientos Petroliferas Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB), Bolivia\u2019s state-owned oil and gas company which in May 2015 sub-contracted BGP to operate in this region, had been previously warned about the existence of \u201cuncontacted\u201d indigenous people. The company was urged, CITRMD claims, to respect \u201ctheir wish not to be contacted\u201d and to stop operating if they came across them. </p> <p>The CITRMD\u2019s letter claims that that advice was ignored - an allegation apparently supported by the radio conversation transcript and the eyewitness testimonies in BGP\u2019s 17 September report. Concern about contact with the group is particularly high because indigenous peoples living in \u201cisolation\u201d in the Amazon do not have immunity to outsiders\u2019 diseases, meaning they can be easily infected and epidemics can spread among them with devastating consequences.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4bcb5eac3501be19adfa4adf0b4557d016d10baa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bcb5eac3501be19adfa4adf0b4557d016d10baa/0_0_1200_958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Map showing BGP\u2019s oil and gas concession in the Bolivian Amazon.

The \u201cToromonas\u201d are one of more than 100 groups of indigenous people in \u201cisolation\u201d in the Amazon - with the vast majority in Brazil and Peru.</p> <p>Bolivia\u2019s 2013 law commits to protecting the lives of indigenous people in \u201cisolation\u201d and requires \u201cpublic and private institutions\u201d \u201cresponsibly\u201d exploiting natural resources to abide by the law\u2019s protection measures - one of which is establishing \u201cbuffer zones\u201d to avoid accidental contact with outsiders. However, the government institution created by that law and responsible for instituting such measures, the Direcci\u00f3n General de Protecci\u00f3n a Naciones y Pueblos Ind\u00edgena Originarios (DIGEPIO), does not exist. </p> <p>Bolivia\u2019s Constitution arguably provides better legal protection than the 2013 law, with Article 31 stating that indigenous peoples in \u201cvoluntary isolation\u201d will be \u201cprotected and respected\u201d and that they have the right to \u201cthe territory which they occupy and inhabit.\u201d Bolivia is also a signatory to the International Labour Organization\u2019s Convention 169, an international law which recognises indigenous peoples\u2019 ownership rights to their land and obliges the government to protect it.</p> <p>Neither BGP nor YPFB responded to questions from the Guardian, but on 17 October Bolivian newspaper <a href=\"http://www.lostiempos.com/actualidad/economia/20161017/ypfb-niega-existencia-pueblo-no-contactado-descarta-cambios\">Los Tiempos</a> reported YPFB\u2019s president, Guillermo Ach\u00e1, \u201cdenying the existence of supposed uncontacted indigenous people in Bolivia\u2019s Amazon\u201d and saying oil and gas operations will continue as planned.</p> <p>\u201cWe have no confirmation of any uncontacted people whatsoever,\u201d Ach\u00e1 was quoted as saying. \u201cI understand this [the recent reports of contact] has been a distortion of information and what we will be doing is looking to continue with all activities.\u201d</p> <p>Ach\u00e1\u2019s reported claims were made despite other YPFB personnel appearing to accept that evidence of indigenous people in \u201cisolation\u201d has been found by BGP. An internal 18 September YPFB report, titled \u201cPresence of <em>Originarios</em> Indigenous People at High Risk\u201d, draws heavily on BGP\u2019s report from the day before and states that \u201cas a result of the events described\u201d and the 2013 law, YPFB had withdrawn all personnel from the critical area. The next day, YPFB\u2019s Miguel Angel Rojas Castro informed the Vice-Minister of Justice about the 17 September near encounter and sent her BGP\u2019s report. However, both YPFB documents appear to express some doubt: the internal 18 September report refers to the \u201cpossible indigenous peoples at high risk\u201d who had been heard calling and shouting by a BGP team, and the letter to the Vice-Minister talks of \u201cthe presence of possible members of <em>originario</em> indigenous people.\u201d</p> <p>Georgina Jimenez, from Bolivian NGO CEDIB, calls the claims made by Ach\u00e1 \u201cscary\u201d and says they \u201crespond more to business interests than the state\u2019s responsibility\u201d to Bolivian citizens.</p> <p>\u201cWhat should be done? All exploratory activity should be immediately stopped,\u201d Jimenez told the Guardian. \u201cAccording to the Constitution, people who are uncontacted or in isolation have the right to remain in that condition and to have the territory where they live legally recognised.\u201d </p> <p>The reports of the near encounters with BGP teams has led to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR) becoming involved. According to Bolivia\u2019s Defensoria del Pueblo, with which the UNHCHR is coordinating, a meeting will be held in Santa Cruz on 31 October to discuss how to prevent possible conflict in the region and ensure that the rights of indigenous peoples at \u201chigh risk\u201d in Bolivia are respected.</p> <p>BGP\u2019s environmental permit to operate was granted in November 2015. According to the EIA, it will involve cutting 21 seismic lines running for over 1,000 kms and detonating underground 190,000 kgs of explosives in its search for oil and/or gas. BGP\u2019s concession is called Nuevo Esperanza, an 800,000 hectare area.</p> <p>A reserved zone was established for the \u201cToromonas\u201d in 2006, although it is in the Madidi National Park and to the south-west of where BGP is currently operating. According to a 2013 report by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the \u201cToromonas\u201d in the reserved zone were at that time threatened by narco-traffickers and an oil and gas concession - different to BGP\u2019s.</p>",

This decision must be reversed.\u201d</p> <p>Hall\u2019s comments will come as a huge boost to the hopes not just of the club but of other local residents threatened with eviction. Lewisham has a powerful elected mayor at the head of its cabinet. For an individual councillor to stick his head above the parapet speaks not just to Hall\u2019s own commitment to transparency but to the levels of ambient disquiet.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in an equally significant turn, Lewisham\u2019s own due diligence report into Renewal\u2019s financial affairs has been released. A freedom of information request to see this document was made on behalf of Millwall two and a half years ago. An appeal to the information commissioner led to the release of a heavily redacted version. A less redacted version has been winkled out this week.</p> <p>A little oddly the document is headed \u201cProject Lion\u201d, presumably the council\u2019s own codeword for its land-grab on The Den. Marked as a draft by the accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers, the report was the chief source of information on Renewal\u2019s finances in late 2013 when the current process was set in train.</p> <p>A section headed \u201cAt a glance \u2013 our views\u201d is redacted. It concludes: \u201cHowever, based on the commercial rationale and anecdotal evidence provided it appears that the two controlling shareholders have the financial wherewithal to continue to offer financial support to the Renewal Group.\u201d</p> <p>The lack of clarity is startling. Under the heading \u201cOur Scope\u201d PWC have rated their access to Renewal management as closer to \u201cnone\u201d than \u201cgood\u201d. Clarity of information is verging on \u201cPoor\u201d. On the first page the report states \u201cit should be noted we have not performed any due diligence on either Incorporated Holdings Limited or Independent Financial Advisers Limited, the two entities which control the Renewal group\u201d. Later PWC add: \u201cAs part of our work we were not able to gain an understanding as to the financial standing of either of these two entities.\u201d Entities, it should be remembered, that currently stand to gain from the use of public powers to evict residents from their homes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/26/millwall-property-developer-the-den-offshore-renewal\">Millwall property developer faces renewed questions over suggestions it wants to sell quickly</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the end of which the question of exactly why Lewisham council are so intent on selling Millwall\u2019s land to these particular offshore developers remains a mystery. The council says it has received greater clarity on Renewal\u2019s workings through subsequent drafts of the report. Indeed the council is eager to point out the CPO decision was based on the August 2016 draft of this report. At the time of writing this draft has not been made available to the Guardian.</p> <p>Crucially PWC\u2019s report does point to the council\u2019s faith in its pre-existing relationship with Mushtaq Malik, chief executive of Renewal and a former senior Lewisham officer. \u201cThe London Borough of Lewisham have a longstanding relationship with Mushtaq Malik,\u201d the report notes. \u201cThe Council benefits from previous knowledge of working with this individual.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed Lewisham\u2019s current chief executive, Barry Quirk, was also chief executive when Malik was at the council in the 1990s. Quirk seemed keen to play down any part in this \u201clong-standing relationship\u201d when asked about it by the Guardian. \u201cOur chief executive has had no professional connection, and no shared interests, with Mushtaq Malik since he left the council in 1995,\u201d a spokesman said.</p> <p>Why could this be? After leaving Lewisham Malik set up a company called Serviceteam supplying services such as rubbish collection to local authorities. Malik\u2019s time at Serviceteam ended in 1997, the same year the London borough of Barnet was successfully prosecuted by the Health and Safety Executive over failings on Serviceteam\u2019s watch, including one accident that led to a bin man having his foot amputated and another being crushed against a lorry. The court also held that the contract for Barnet\u2019s waste collection was \u201cpotentially under-funded\u201d. Later that same year Malik resigned from all six of his directorships, appearing back on the directors\u2019 roll in 2002.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/09/lewisham-millwall-the-den\">Why Lewisham\u2019s plans for Millwall\u2019s Den really take the biscuit | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Malik\u2019s spokeswoman told the Guardian that his departure from the company \u201cwas not linked to\u201d any of the above operating issues. They pointed out that Serviceteam had inherited from another company the Barnet waste contract, which was already \u201chistorically significantly under-funded\u201d. In the interests of balance Malik\u2019s spokeswoman also stated that Serviceteam were \u201csuccessfully providing services to more than 70 local authorities\u201d at the time.</p> <p>Millwall still have hopes of advancing their own plans to regenerate the area, providing more affordable and social housing than the current minimal scheme. Instead, as councillor Hall points out: \u201cMillwall are not being included in the plans. They have been a famous, thriving sporting institution in this area for over a hundred years. Up until recently Lewisham have worked closely with Millwall and now that important relationship is being badly undermined by the spectacular mishandling of the whole project.\u201d</p> <p>On the pitch Millwall\u2019s more mundane struggles in League One were eased a little at the weekend by a 2-1 defeat of Fleetwood Town in south Bermondsey. Off it the future looks less certain. Already there have been dark mutterings among some fans about a full-on gentrification-led exile to the wilds of Kent. And really at heart this is a struggle for the right to exist in a city where every plot is parcelled out and costed up. Millwall\u2019s corner of inner-outer London, pushed up against the bend in the river, has always felt like a slightly lost world, a place where a less violently stratified version of the city has been allowed to linger. Nobody doubts that regeneration is needed. The question is how and for whose benefit.</p> <p>For now the council continues to \u201cinvestigate the veracity\u201d of the marketing brochure made public by the Guardian last month. That document appeared to suggest one of Renewal\u2019s offshore owners had already been looking into selling its interest in the development. Its emergence led to the last-ditch cancellation of the council\u2019s own hearing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/28/millwall-land-battle-new-document-sparks-investigation\">Millwall land battle takes further twist as new document sparks investigation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Renewal has since denied any knowledge of the brochure and denied it has any intention to sell.

Close relationships between local authorities and private companies emerged as a Blairite initiative in the mid-1990s (Sullivan \u2013 ex-mayor, ex-Renewal \u2013 even gave his son the middle name \u201cBlair\u201d).</p> <p>The layers of confusion in the current CPO have now led to a splinter in the council, with a growing sense of anger among Labour backbenchers, the majority of whom stand to the left of this in a space where forced sales of public land to an offshore developer do not reflect Labour values. Millwall\u2019s CPO order is likely to be reheard later this month. In a battle on many fronts this part of the campaign may be just beginning.</p>",
  "<p>The British and French governments were accused of breaching children\u2019s human rights as up to 50 teenagers were abandoned by authorities in Calais and forced into an industrial estate near the cleared-out refugee camp to sleep in makeshift conditions.</p> <p>The teenagers were lured out of the site of the camp in the afternoon with the promise of transport to a reception centre where they could be assessed for asylum or reunification with families in the UK.<br></p> <p>However, after an hour no bus had arrived.

One, Alice Sturrock from Edinburgh, said: \u201cI did not think at 22 I would be on fire patrol in a refugee camp. There is a fire burning over that side and there are CRS [French police] with rubber bullets on the other. How is this a safe haven for children?\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThey are fed up, tired and sad. It is crazy that no provision has been made for them. They have been given no information all day,\u201d Inca Sorrell, another volunteer who has worked with child refugees in Calais for the past year, said.</p> <p>Sheehan had earlier said she could not believe what she was seeing, given that the French ambassador in London and and Home Office minister Baroness Williams had given assurances some weeks ago that the demolition of the site would not begin before all the children were safeguarded.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis is so humiliating and undignified,\u201d Sheehan said. \u201cThese children have literally been pushed from pillar to post. They have sat there obediently under the bridge for several hours and then they were kettled. Now the instruction is that these people must disperse. It is as if the authorities are trying to wish the problem away. But the longer the keep their heads in the sand and don\u2019t offer a solution, the bigger the problem will be.\u201d</p> <p>An atmosphere of despair among charity workers was mirrored by the behaviour of the children, all aged approximately 14 to 17, some of whom huddled against the wall in blankets as the temperature plummeted.<br></p> <p>One Afghan teenager, wrapped in a yellow and green sleeping bag, said: \u201cFuck France, Fuck Britain. You are racists.\u201d<br></p> <p>He was in tears as a French volunteer tried to console him by asking him not to be angry with aid workers.

Fuck France.\u201d<br></p> <p>Annie Gavrilescu, a volunteer with the charity <a href=\"http://helprefugees.org.uk\">Help Refugees</a>, said there was no sign of any official assistance for the children. \u201cThe <em>sous-pr\u00e9fet</em> [highest-ranking local civil servant] has washed his hands of them. There is nowhere for them to go. Those kids have been there with volunteers and officials, all day, waiting for buses. They have been given nothing. They are just tired and hungry.\u201d</p> <p>Save the Children spokeswoman Dorothy Sang, whose organisation had helped persuade the children to leave the camp on a promise of fresh shelter and the start of a new life, said: \u201cYet again these children have been put in a dangerous position.

But I don\u2019t want to go back to Bulgaria. The police there beat me up and kept me in jail for 15 or 16 days. They kicked us and starved us and treated us like animals.</p> <p>\u201cI had a few friends in the Jungle and received news that people were going to get a chance to apply for asylum, so I thought I might be reassessed here and given a fresh chance away from Bulgaria.\u201d</p> <p>He had only been in the Jungle one night \u2013 the night that part of it was razed to the ground. \u201cMy expectations of Calais were so high. But the Jungle is so terrible,\u201d said the teenager, who did not want his name or photograph published. \u201cI never guessed there would be such a place. How can people live like that?\u201d But he added: \u201cNothing can be worse than the experience I have had, the problems everyone has had. Nobody, if they had a choice, would live in the Jungle.\u201d</p> <p>He said he came from a \u201cbroad-minded family\u201d, with a father who \u201csupported our education\u201d. But problems started when two of his brothers started working for the US embassy and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usaid\">USAid</a>.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe Taliban asked why they were working for these non-Muslim people. \u2018You must bring them to us and we will kidnap them and in exchange force them to release the Taliban in jail.\u2019 They say, why do you not join our party? But I don\u2019t want to join that disgusting party \u2013 my father taught us to be broad-minded.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cBut in Europe, even, nobody wants to give me a chance. Even in Germany, where I have been for 15 months. It took them eight months to process me and then they said I had to go back to Bulgaria,\u201d he said.</p>",

Usually they call the police before the police call them, letting them know which of Melbourne\u2019s major race meets they\u2019ll be turning up to with their banners and Celotto\u2019s megaphone.</p> <p>CPR call their online home \u201cthe website the racing industry doesn\u2019t want you to see,\u201d and it outlines their four primary issues of concern: \u201cwastage\u201din horses no longer fit for racing are sent to the knackery, the use of whips, the racing of two-year-old horses \u2013 which CPR claims are not skeletally mature enough for racing \u2013 and jumps racing, whose dangers the group have claimed a prominent role in dragging into the spotlight in the past six years.</p> <p>To me it feels like a numbers game, one stacked heavily against the likes of Celotto and his colleagues, but seeing him protest the parade last year made me wonder what makes a man take up such a seemingly hopeless cause. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/anti-jumps-protester-arrested-in-vic/story-fncynkc6-1226426554887\">In 2012 Celotto was arrested</a> as he protested a jumps meet at Sandown in Melbourne\u2019s south-east, and again last year outside a major racing day at Sydney\u2019s Rose Hill racecourse which, ironically, he has never actually entered. The arrests, he says, might be more problematic were he not a self-employed builder and property developer.</p> <p>Speaking to me in the lead-up to planned protests on Derby and Melbourne Cup days this year, 54-year-old Celotto says his journey to animal rights activism began when he read Peter Singer\u2019s Animal Liberation in his mid-20s. Having reached only page 40 page he had a \u201cvery defining moment\u201d and concluded that not only could he no longer eat meat, he needed to involve himself in animal rights activism.</p> <p>\u201cIt simply wasn\u2019t enough just to be vegetarian,\u201d Celotto says. \u201cThese animals have no voice and I decided to be one of the many people around the world who use their voice for those who can\u2019t speak for themselves.\u201d</p> <p>His first step to that end was highly unusual; parachuting one day in a country town, Celotto spotted a piggery from the air and wondered what was going on inside. He soon found out by acting as a kind of gonzo undercover investigator, getting himself a job there so he could get an unfiltered glimpse of industry practices. \u201cThat was the start of my animal activism,\u201d he says of the months he spent observing up close the way animals are treated when protestors <em>aren\u2019t</em> around. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/banned-for-the-first-time-in-30-years-waterbirds-hero-is-silenced-20151216-glow0b.html\">Laurie Levy\u2019s Coalition against Duck Shooting</a> provided Celotto further inspiration in his decades of work protesting against hunting. \u201cHe was someone I greatly admire as someone who was prepared to put himself on the line for the lives of ducks on the wetlands,\u201d Celotto says. \u201cEvery person who works in the animal movement is an inspiration for me.\u201d</p> <p>The suit I saw Celotto wearing at last year\u2019s cup parade is in part of a reflection of the kinds of people he wants to gain access to with his message. He\u2019s in regular contact with Racing Australia CEO Peter McGauran and has successfully lobbied for the racing industry to consider a \u201cretirement plan\u201d for horses. So far that entails the introduction of documentation pertaining to the destination of each racing horse that is retired, though Celotto is not satisfied that it currently goes far enough.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9555766f4985d15cee80829e0d5b2fc498102a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9555766f4985d15cee80829e0d5b2fc498102a3/0_63_4193_2516/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Admire Rakti\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Admire Rakti, the Japanese horse who died in the stalls of the Melbourne Cup in November 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Smith/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At Spring Carnival time, sub-contractors on Celotto\u2019s building sites are now used to downing tools as the boss dons his suit and heads off to the races. \u201cThey think it\u2019s a bit odd, but they\u2019ve got used to it now,\u201d he laughs. </p> <p>He can\u2019t rule out the possibility that his protesting will get him in further trouble. \u201cYou make a decision on what you think is right,\u201d Celotto says of the risk of arrest. \u201cWhen you\u2019re doing animal rights work, you need to try and make a point and sometimes you have to do things that aren\u2019t technically legal, and you have to make a call on what is more important. Often the call is made that standing up for animals is more important than risking a fine or being charged with something.</p> <p>\u201cThroughout history, whenever there\u2019s been any kind of social movement, it\u2019s because people have been prepared to fight for what they believe in. There are a lot of people standing up for animals right now and they need to, because they need our help.\u201d</p> <p>Celotto is realistic that the racing industry isn\u2019t going anywhere fast and that \u201cthe end aim will never be achieved\u201d, but sets himself realistic goals and wants to ensure racehorses are given the same respect as any other animal. </p> <p>\u201cThey deserve the right to live their entire lives free of pain and suffering and to do that the whip needs to be abolished,\u201d Celotto says. He points to Norwegian racing \u2013 which banned the whip in 1982 \u2013 as an example that the sport can survive just fine without it. \u201cTo me, abolishing the whip would be the greatest thing the racing industry could do but because they\u2019re like an old dinosaur, they\u2019re very resistant to any kind of change.\u201d</p> <p>Celotto is most insistent on the idea of a retirement plan for horses, and remains most worried about what happens to thoroughbreds when the marquees are packed up and the fascinators are stored away for another year. \u201cIt\u2019s going to happen slowly and there are some positive steps being made and we applaud the racing industry for taking those steps,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in talks with Racing Victoria and Racing Australia. We\u2019ve brought to their attention issues relating to what happens to racehorses when their career is over. They\u2019ve responded by now having a retirement form, which we don\u2019t think is anywhere near acceptable, but at least they now have a retirement form.\u201d</p> <p>That form, the AR64J, doesn\u2019t require owners to detail exactly where the horse is going and it\u2019s often impossible to track exactly where horses actually end up. Celotto is also scathing when he discusses jumps racing, which he describes as a \u201cblight on the racing industry\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cYou see horses falling and dying for the entertainment of very few people.\u201d</p> <p>On Melbourne Cup day Celotto and up to 200 friends of the CPR, including members of the Melbourne LGBTI community, will gather for a picnic at Newmarket Reserve \u2013 not just to protest, but create a festive atmosphere of their own with \u201chuman races\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have all our flags and banners. Our message will be to show people that you don\u2019t have to go to the Melbourne Cup or any race meet to have a good time,\u201d Celotto says. \u201cSome of the races are going to be really wacky. We\u2019ve got the \u2018High Stakes\u2019, which is about having either the highest heels or the highest fascinator, rather than who crosses the finishing line first. It\u2019s about who does it with the most style.\u201d</p> <p>Underlying every protest Celotto organises, he says, is the belief that animals not be treated as \u201cjust animals\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say the people involved in racing are necessarily bad people,\u201d he concludes with words I find slightly surprising. \u201cI would say that there\u2019s a lot of people in racing that fail to recognise the horse\u2019s innate nature. These animals are no different to any living animal, including humans. They seek to avoid harm. They seek to be happy. They\u2019re no different to people, and they feel pain. They\u2019re treated like they\u2019re disposable objects.</p> <p>\u201cWe live in a time where our planet is very much designed to benefit humans. There\u2019s 20 million different species of animals and plants out there who also inhabit this planet. We\u2019re all basically trying to do the same thing: live our lives avoiding pain and suffering and being happy. Racehorses are no different.\u201d<br></p>",

  "<p>Scarred by the 2015 general election and humbled by the Brexit vote, it\u2019s hardly surprising that many in the British political and media class continue to hedge their bets on the 2016 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\" title=\"\">US presidential election</a>, even as the climax of the contest draws near. The instinct for caution is understandable. These have been chastening times in British politics. No one wants to make three wrong calls in a row.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/27/trump-clinton-news-vote-election-2016\">Michelle Obama campaigns with Clinton as Trump hits Ohio \u2013 election live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the case of the US election, however, there is also an uneasy self-awareness of something close to groupthink. Unlike the UK general election or the EU referendum, where divisions within the political and media class were real and deep, there is something close to unanimity about British antipathy to Donald Trump. You have to be intensely anti-American or anti-Clinton \u2013 which some are \u2013 to positively wish a Trump victory on America and the world.</p> <p>This helps to explain, though not to excuse, the reluctance to face the overwhelming probability about the US presidential contest. That probability is that Hillary Clinton, with all her strengths and weaknesses, is going to win on 8&#xa0;November, and is quite possibly going to win by a very large margin. Unless something quite exceptional and so far wholly undetected is happening \u2013 the instinct for bet-hedging, you see, is hard to shake off even here \u2013 Clinton will be taking over the White House in January.</p> <p>The clearest and most immediate evidence is in the opinion polls, which consistently show Clinton ahead in the popular vote. That process has been strengthened by the televised debates and, in particular by the final debate, which Clinton clearly won, and in which Trump\u2019s hostility to women seems to have had a lasting mobilisation impact.</p> <p>That generally strong Clinton lead is also buttressed by local polling in the states where victory is essential under America\u2019s electoral college system. With&#xa0;occasional exceptions, these polls show Clinton on course for a large electoral college win. Dismiss the polls if you like. But the fact that Trump and his running mate Mike Pence are spending time campaigning in states such as North Carolina and Utah shows that they are having to defend their own territories rather than attack in Clinton\u2019s.</p> <p>All this may change, of course. It\u2019s&#xa0;the&#xa0;safest prediction in the book to say that the contest will narrow in the final days. But the general likelihood is surely&#xa0;that it will not narrow much. By this stage in 2012, only 9% of voters had not made up their minds. It seems unlikely that the proportion would be much different in such a bitterly contested election as this one has been. The big unpredictability this time is voter turnout. If Trump brings lots of new voters to the polls, and at the same time&#xa0;Clinton fails to bring significant parts of the Obama coalition to them, then an upset \u2013 which at this stage would be a much tighter Clinton win, not a Trump win \u2013 might just happen.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/20/presidential-debate-highlights-clinton-and-trumps-final-face-off-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58aff\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2822379\"            data-video-name=\"Presidential debate highlights: Clinton and Trump's final face-off \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters / AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58086051e4b055209adaf6c9\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/20/161020Debatesub_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/20/161020Debatesub_V4.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/20/161020Debatesub.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/20/presidential-debate-highlights-clinton-and-trumps-final-face-off-video\">Presidential debate highlights: Clinton and Trump\u2019s final face-off \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Even in an election as bitter as this one, the claim that lots of states are \u201cup for grabs\u201d is less true than ever. Since 1992, 31 of America\u2019s 50 states have voted consistently in every presidential contest. In most modern US elections, people who consider themselves Democrats vote Democratic, while an equally large proportion of people who consider themselves Republicans vote Republican. A lot is always written at this stage in the campaign about the importance of self-described independents, but these voters tend to lean either Democratic or Republican, and to vote the way they lean too. One estimate puts the proportion of pure independents at only 5%. The veteran poll analyst Charlie Cook says that most voters are already \u201cbaked into the cake\u201d.</p> <p>Part of that is simply because of long-established demographic changes that advantage the Democrats. When Bill Clinton won in 1992, white voters cast 87% of the total vote. By the time of Barack Obama\u2019s re-election in 2012, just 20 years later, the white share had fallen to 72%. One prediction says it will be 70% in November. If each demographic group votes the same way in 2016 as in 2012, the Democratic lead will rise by about 1.5%. Trump has done nothing to combat this and plenty to feed it. In light of Trump\u2019s attacks on women during the campaign, it seems likely that an even higher proportion of white women voters will move into the Democratic column too.</p> <p>All this appears to be entirely consistent with the much discussed recent book <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10671.html\" title=\"\">Democracy for Realists</a> by the American political scientists Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels. They argue that elections are not determined by voters\u2019 policy preferences or ideologies, as many of us like to think, but \u201con the basis of who they are \u2013 their social identities\u201d. Certainly the Achen-Bartels thesis chimes with the Brexit vote in Britain. In America, though, where race and ethnicity are such important components of social identities, but not the only ones, Trump\u2019s consistent attempt to appeal to white male voters and alienate minority and female voters does not look like a winning strategy at all; indeed quite the reverse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/oct/27/middletown-trump-muncie-clinton\">The view from Middletown: 'Trump speaks to us in a way other people don\u2019t'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The immediate question, 12 days from the election, is less whether Clinton will win the presidency. It is more whether she can manage to persuade enough voters to elect a Congress that can work with her, not against her, as has been Obama\u2019s fate for the past six years. The Democrats stand a good chance of winning the four seats necessary \u2013 Illinois, Wisconsin and two from seven other toss-up states \u2013 to regain control of the Senate (where 34 of the 100 seats are up for election). However, control of the House of Representatives (where all 435 members are contested but incumbency is frequently decisive) seems likely to remain in Republican hands. All this suggests that Clinton will not have an easy presidency, even in the first two years, unless Republicans allow that to happen. Since Republicans expect to make gains in the 2018 midterms, they have little incentive to do that.</p> <p>The Republican pollster Frank Luntz&#xa0;\u2013 whom Trump described on Twitter as \u201ca total clown \u2026 a low-class slob\u201d \u2013 said that if the campaign this autumn were about Trump, then Clinton would win; if it were&#xa0;about Clinton, then Trump could pull it off. Overwhelmingly, the campaign has proved to be about Trump. But that\u2019s now about to change.</p> <p>Increasingly, Donald Trump looks like&#xa0;a more incidental figure, preoccupied with his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/26/donald-trump-opens-international-hotel-campaign-trail-brand\" title=\"\">hotels</a> and his media ambitions.

  "<p>Philip Hammond took comfort from the latest GDP figures \u2013 and well he might. When the chancellor moved into No 11 there was still the possibility that doom-and-gloom forecasts by the International Monetary Fund and even the Treasury itself would come to pass.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/uk-economy-defies-brexit-slowdown-fears\">That Britain has avoided a recession</a> and, more than that, maintained an annual growth rate of around 2% is a testament to the resilience of an economy that has grown solidly for the last three years and surpassed all other G7 countries this year.</p> <p>Seeking further reassurance, Hammond need look no further than lobbyists for the manufacturing sector, who say the dip in factory output over the three months to the end of September was temporary and merely reflects a slowdown from a stellar performance earlier in the year. House builders, who almost downed tools in the first half of the year, claim the foundations are in place for a construction boom in 2017.</p> <p>The building and manufacturing sectors were among the biggest drags on the economy\u2019s recent performance, so these messages could act as a balm on Treasury thinking, encouraging Hammond to think that all he needs to say in next month\u2019s autumn statement is \u201csteady as she goes\u201d.</p> <p>That would be a mistake. And Hammond\u2019s response shows he thinks so too.</p> <p><a href=\"http://news.sky.com/video/we-negotiate-with-the-eu-from-a-position-of-strength-10633889\">In TV interviews he said</a> there is worse to come next year as the uncertainty grows over what kind of relationship we can secure with the European Union.

At whichever point, the slugging match between London and Brussels could make the clash between West Ham and Chelsea fans this week look as tame as an afternoon tea dance. It follows that without a string of Treasury initiatives already in place, consumer confidence could evaporate more than it already has and the economy could tank.<br></p> <p>However, the suspicion must be that he backs away from making significant gestures. For one thing, six years of austerity have left him with a string of public services crying out for more cash, and not just the NHS.</p> <p>If he considers it more important to save some services from ruin, it could eat up much of the cash he has reclaimed after ditching George Osborne\u2019s strict deficit reduction plans. </p> <p>Of course, he could separate investment spending from the day-to-day demands of Whitehall departments, just as Strictly star and former shadow chancellor Ed Balls said he would before the 2015 election.

Its road safety spokesman, Pete Williams, said: \u201cThe number of fixed penalty notices issued by police forces in England and Wales for illegal handheld phone use at the wheel has, frankly, fallen off a cliff.</p> <p>\u201cThe figures lay bare the scale of the handheld mobile phone epidemic that has been allowed to sweep across the country largely unchallenged. The simple truth is the problem of illegal handheld phone use at the wheel is undeniably getting worse, with fewer and fewer people being caught.\u201d</p> <p>The Department for Transport (DfT) has vowed to crack down on the use of mobiles at the wheel \u2013 a factor cited in 22 fatal accidents last year \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/17/penalty-points-fines-double-drivers-using-mobile-phones-200\">by doubling fines</a>. But government statistics released on Thursday suggest depleted police forces are no longer willing or able to enforce the rules.</p> <p>Some of the drop in fixed penalties has been ascribed to drivers being more aware of the law or police sending drivers on education courses, but the number of fines issued for offences caught automatically by cameras, such as speeding, have increased. </p> <p>Other infringements are being ignored, motoring organisations believe. The data shows that the number of fines issued for seatbelt offences has dropped dramatically, from 140,900 in 2011 to 19,800 last year.</p> <p>RAC research released in September showed that the proportion of motorists who believe calling while driving is acceptable has doubled to 14%, from 7% in 2014, and one in five drivers believes it is safe to check social media on their phone while stopped in traffic. </p> <p>Williams said: \u201cAttitudes are clearly relaxing as a result of drivers no longer fearing punishment.\u201d</p> <p>Last month the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, announced that tougher penalties would be introduced from 2017, likely to raise fixed penalty fines from \u00a3100 to at least \u00a3150, and the number of points added to the driving licence of offenders from three to four or six, potentially with higher sanctions for HGV drivers. </p> <p>But the RAC said fewer traffic police meant that motorists had decreasing confidence that the law would be enforced. According to the RAC, there has been a 27% decline in full-time roads policing officers since 2010. </p> <p>The DfT said it would also be starting a \u201chard-hitting campaign\u201d to make phone use at the wheel socially unacceptable.</p> <p>Chief constable Suzette Davenport, of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, said: \u201cPolice have adapted to significant increases in motorists\u2019 use of mobile phones at the wheel, as well as phones themselves becoming much smarter. </p> <p>\u201cIn recent years, officers have had more tactics available them, such as sending offenders on courses to learn about the impact and consequences of driving when distracted and the key principles of road safety, and our approach is a blend of enforcement and education.</p> <p>\u201cLike drink-driving, we have to work towards changing people\u2019s attitudes.

  "<p>Dozens of Labour MPs are facing a backlash for being absent from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/labour-call-for-uk-to-withdraw-support-for-saudi-led-coalition-in-yemen-fails\">their party\u2019s motion to withdraw UK support from Saudi Arabia\u2019s war on Yemen,</a> with Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, calling their actions disappointing.</p> <p>Thornberry said the motion would have sent a message to the government that MPs do not want to back the war without an independent UN investigation into whether the Saudi-led coalition is breaking humanitarian law.</p> <p>About 100 Labour MPs were missing or deliberately abstained from the vote on Wednesday, which failed by 283 votes to 193, although several dozen were given authorised absences by the whips.</p> <p>In response, Thornberry, who argued for the motion from the Labour frontbench, said she was disappointed with her colleagues for abstaining and disgusted with the Conservatives who voted against withdrawing support from Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>\u201cYesterday\u2019s motion gave us the opportunity to send the opposite message to the world \u2026 that, while Saudi Arabia will remain a valued strategic, security and economic ally in the years to come, our support for their forces in Yemen must be suspended until the alleged violations of international humanitarian law in that conflict have been fully and independently investigated. And until the children of Yemen have received the humanitarian aid that they so desperately need,\u201d she said. <br></p> <p>\u201cThat would have been the right message to send to the rest of the world. That would have reflected what we should stand for as a country. And that is why I was so disgusted that all but one brave Tory MP voted against sending such a message and disappointed that some of my Labour colleagues abstained from doing so.\u201d</p> <p>One Labour MP, who is not supportive of the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, but voted for the motion, said he was frustrated and upset that a number of his colleagues were \u201cusing the issue as a way of trying to beat Jeremy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is such as serious issue and it\u2019s obviously going on the Tory side as well, but there is a massive humanitarian disaster here. It should not be an opportunity to score political points,\u201d he said.</p> <p>It is understood some Labour MPs who opposed the motion were orchestrating deliberate abstentions and in discussions with some Conservatives about the chances of defeating it.</p> <p>A number of Labour MPs faced criticism on social media for not turning up to the vote, with lists of names circulating despite some having permission not to turn up for family, health or job-related reasons.</p> <p>It came as <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/2016-10-26/itv-news-sees-evidence-british-made-cluster-bombs-used-in-yemen-attacks/\">ITV News said it had seen evidence that British-made cluster bombs had been used in Yemen attacks</a> and there were pictures in the media of people suffering severe malnutrition.</p> <p>Corbyn renewed his calls for the government to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia on Thursday, saying it seems \u201cvery disturbing that there appears to be evidence British weaponry has been used in Yemen\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe put a motion to the House of Commons demanding a UN investigation into what\u2019s happened in Yemen and I absolutely stand by the resolution we put,\u201d he said. \u201cMy own view is that they should suspend supplies until such time as we have had the investigation.\u201d</p> <p>In the debate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris\">Boris Johnson</a>, the foreign secretary, rejected the suspension of arms sales, saying other western countries would \u201chappily supply arms\u201d to Saudi Arabia without the same protections demanded by Britain. </p> <p>He added that suspending arms sales would \u201cat a stroke\u201d eliminate Britain\u2019s diplomatic influence in the Yemen conflict, during which the Saudi-led coalition has been accused of war crimes. He also said it was right that Saudi Arabia first conducted its own investigation.</p>",

  "<p>A male contraceptive jab has been shown to be almost as effective as the female pill in a trial that could pave the way for men and women being able to share equal responsibility for birth control.</p> <p>In the study, 350 men were given injections of hormones that were shown to dramatically lower their sperm count by \u201cswitching off\u201d the male reproductive system. The drugs caused some unpleasant side-effects, however, meaning that the trial had to be halted early.<br></p> <p>The men, who were all in long-term relationships, relied on the drugs to prevent unplanned pregnancies - and the combination of hormones was found to be nearly 96% effective.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/23/what-happened-to-the-male-contraceptive-pill\">What happened to the male contraceptive pill?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Richard Anderson, a professor of clinical reproductive science and author of the study, said: \u201cIf you\u2019re comparing it to other reversible male methods, it\u2019s far better than the condom and it puts it in the same ballpark as the pill.\u201d<br></p> <p>However, the treatment was judged to have unacceptable side-effects, including depression, acne and increased libido, which caused 20 men to drop out of the study and ultimately led to the trial be stopped earlier than planned.</p> <p>The trial involved injections of two hormones. A long-acting form of progestogen was designed to act on the pituitary gland to switch off sperm production. Testosterone was added to offset a drop in the male hormone triggered by the progestogen. \u201cYou need the testosterone to feel OK,\u201d said Anderson.</p> <p>After an initial period, when couples used both the injections and other birth control methods, the men entered the study\u2019s \u201cefficacy phase\u201d. This lasted up to a year and the men relied on the jabs alone, which they received every two months. </p> <p>Only four pregnancies occurred among partners of the 274 men, indicating a similar level of efficacy to the female combined pill and significantly better protection than condoms, which in <a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/condom/how-effective-are-condoms\">real-life conditions are about 82% effective</a>.</p> <p>However, scientists stopped enrolling new participants into the study in 2011 due to the rate of reported side-effects. </p> <p>Of the 1,491 incidents, 39% were found to be unrelated to the treatment. This included one suicide. One man experienced an abnormally fast and irregular heartbeat when he stopped receiving the injections. </p> <p>Despite the side effects, at the end of the trial, three-quarters of the men said they would be willing to continue using the contraceptive jab. The scientists said it might be possible to reduce the side-effects by changing the dose of hormones or the way they are delivered.</p> <p>\u201cThe results provide us with confidence that this can be done,\u201d said Anderson.</p> <p>He added that it would be difficult to convert the treatment to a pill form because the hormones are quickly metabolised by the liver, but the scientists are planning a new trial in which the combination is delivered through a gel that the men could rub on their chest each morning.</p> <p>Other scientists were less convinced that the side-effects of could be overcome, however. Sarah Jones, a reader in pharmacology at the University of Wolverhampton, said: \u201cMost previous attempts at male contraception that have involved hormonal targets have led to severe side-effects or have been irreversible.

  "<p>David Bradley wants to meet in Barnsley. This is where he grew up. It is where Kes, the film that changed his life, was made, and where he still lives. He is waiting for me in the middle of the road as I come out of the station, waving exuberantly. He then drives me a few miles south to the village of Tankersley. It was here, in 1965, that author Barry Hines\u2019s younger brother, Richard, trained a kestrel, homing her in the air-raid shelter at the bottom of Barry\u2019s garden. Richard wanted to call her Kessy; Barry suggested Kes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/08/kes-review\">Kes \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bradley wants to talk in a pub he likes, which seems a generic suggestion until we get there: the last time he was here, he says, was for Barry Hines\u2019s wake. Hines, who had Alzheimer\u2019s for nine years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/20/barry-hines-obituary-a-kestrel-for-a-knave-author\">died in March</a>, age 76, and is buried at a nearby church. Bradley, now 63, softly spoken and sensitive, has been inextricably linked to Hines and Kes since he was cast, aged 14, in Ken Loach\u2019s 1969 adaptation of Hines\u2019s novel A Kestrel for a Knave. The film, about Billy Casper, a neglected working-class 15-year-old who finds solace training a kestrel, was a gentle drama about harsh circumstances. It was a sensation, winning Bradley a Bafta for most promising newcomer.</p> <p>Bradley was, he says, an ordinary kid who had failed his 11-plus and went to St Helen\u2019s, a Barnsley secondary modern school. His father was a miner, and Bradley was expected to follow suit, but says he wouldn\u2019t have been able to cope down the pits. Local author Hines didn\u2019t yet know Bradley, but he knew kids just like him. Hines\u2019s father was a miner, and Hines, who had been a teacher at St Helen\u2019s and modelled the school in his book after it, wanted to write about the pig-headedness of disregarding pupils who failed the 11-plus, thus branding them with inferiority complexes. Loach was equally keen to mine the subject on film.</p> <p>Bradley, who had starred in school pantomimes at St Helen\u2019s, showed off keen improvisational chops in auditions, and was offered the job. The same day, a fortnight before shooting began, he was summoned to Barry Hines\u2019s house to start training the three kestrels to be used in the film. (They were named Freeman, Hardy &amp; Willis, after the shoe shop.) Bradley was paired with Hardy, while Barry and Richard worked with the other two, which was just as well: \u201cWillis was freaking out all the time: it just wouldn\u2019t do anything. We had to reintroduce him back into the wild.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aabffb48b78f45bd852a9d0fc2dd9cbecf60a138\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aabffb48b78f45bd852a9d0fc2dd9cbecf60a138/0_0_2745_2140/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bradley during the filming of Kes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"780\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bradley with Barry Hines during the filming of Kes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Woodfall Film Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In striving for authenticity, Loach was as unpredictable as Willis. \u201cHe would play tricks to see if he could get a reaction,\u201d says Bradley. In one scene, Bradley runs down a street, chased by a barking dog: he is convinced Loach had someone hiding who \u201cthrew the dog into the middle of the road\u201d. For <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aabrXxnvTpU\">the famous sequence in which Bradley and other schoolboys are caned</a>, they had been assured Loach would call \u201ccut\u201d just before they were struck \u2013 he didn\u2019t. \u201cYou can\u2019t imitate that expression, the point at which the cane strikes the hand,\u201d Loach later explained. \u201cSo we just caned them, really.\u201d</p> <p>To elicit a realistic emotional response for the film\u2019s bleak climax, in which Billy\u2019s self-loathing brother Jud (Freddie Fletcher) kills Kes, Loach approached Fletcher and Bradley in the lunch queue and told Fletcher to go off with Richard Hines and slaughter Hardy for the required corpse. Bradley says he wasn\u2019t convinced \u2013 \u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe these nice people could be so cruel\u201d \u2013 and after shooting the scene was reunited with Hardy (the one on camera had died from natural causes). \u201cI said to them: \u2018I knew you wouldn\u2019t kill him! I knew you wouldn\u2019t!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>After Kes, Bradley changed his professional name to Dai (because of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bradley_(actor)\">the other David Bradley, last seen in Game of Thrones</a>), got some TV work, enjoyed a spell with the National Theatre (including the lead in Equus), and on film appeared in Zulu Dawn and 1979\u2019s All Quiet on the Western Front. After that though, work dried up somewhat. He bought a church and spent three years part-converting it into a home, but his co-investor didn\u2019t come up with the other 50%. Meanwhile, a play he was doing in the US came to nothing when the producer didn\u2019t arrange for him to get a green card. He came home, and reluctantly sold the church.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V3x_2fSCK8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8V3x_2fSCK8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>He speaks with great affection about Kes \u2013 the tie has not been cut. In 2009, he told a BBC TV crew that every couple of years he revisits the woods filmed in Kes, as they remind him of making the film. Does he feel emotionally attached to it? He pauses for some time. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say ... I don\u2019t often go now, I try to go at least once a year, because the wood which Billy used to walk through to the old ruined manor house was absolutely fantastic when I was a young lad. It was as you saw it in the film, a canopy of green dappled sunlight.\u201d</p> <p>He appears at public screenings of Kes, but can\u2019t watch the last 20 minutes as it upsets him too much. \u201cI have to apologise to audiences,\u201d he says. \u201cI say to them: \u2018Please excuse me if you see this shadow walking out at the end; it\u2019s just too much to stay behind.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80e7bfea55e7079502d89072cb8afae642067b33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80e7bfea55e7079502d89072cb8afae642067b33/0_0_3275_2540/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bradley in Kes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"776\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bradley in Kes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I ask about the <a href=\"http://www.kes-billycasper.co.uk/\">site he runs, called Kes: Billy Casper</a>, which features his CV, a guestbook and a detailed rundown of the film\u2019s locations. \u201cIt was prompted by the fans,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I get so bored of it. There\u2019s a fan section where they\u2019re invited to write to me, and there are hundreds of these little promos for various types of pills. And I just get so bored of erasing those all the time.\u201d Spam? \u201cYes, offering legal-high-type things. I erase a month\u2019s worth and then another couple of months\u2019 worth comes within a week, and I think: \u2018God, why did I invite the fans to write to me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>I ask if he stays in touch with anyone from the film. \u201cWe try to see each other once a year if possible, just for half an hour, to say hello,\u201d he says of Loach, and then, talking about Barry Hines, comes a reveal. Bradley had got back in touch \u201cbecause I\u2019d penned a sequel to Kes\u201d, he says, matter of factly. What? He wrote a sequel? A book or a screenplay? \u201cI\u2019d loved for it to have been both. But I didn\u2019t think that I could go through with it without Barry\u2019s approval.\u201d He says that he\u2019s written a few things over the years, including a couple of TV scripts \u2013 one called Shake, Rattle and Roll based on his own experiences in the World Backgammon Championships \u2013 that didn\u2019t work out.</p> <p>His Kes sequel came about because someone told him they had funding and an idea for a sequel, but Bradley didn\u2019t like the idea and besides, the money never materialised. \u201cI discovered that he was wanted by the police on three different continents,\u201d he says of the financer. \u201cI tend to commit myself to projects without any kind of financial insurance. And I\u2019m the one that gets burned.\u201d So he wrote his own sequel, in which Billy runs away to London and gets into trouble, sniffing glue, washing car windscreens at traffic lights, but is adopted by a couple and ends up converting a narrowboat. Bradley never showed it to Hines. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t well enough. I didn\u2019t even tell his wife.

Someone crawled out of the woodwork and sold some acoustic demo recordings he had made a few years earlier as a teenager to Verve Records. Verve decided to add bass, drums and strings to the songs, which consisted of voice and acoustic guitar only, in order to make them sound more like the single he had in the charts. The whole affair reeks of the worst side of the exploitative music business of those days \u2013 and yet \u2026 somehow they made something beautiful. It\u2019s like a weird, inverted form of sampling: instead of cutting and pasting the vocals and guitar over a steady rhythm track \u2013 as would happen today \u2013 Lind\u2019s performances speed up, slow down, have irregular bar counts, and the bass and drums just have to follow him as best they can. So the songs end up with very modern-sounding, unusual structures. The dislocation between the various elements emphasises the loneliness in the songs. It has an absolutely unique atmosphere \u2013 the voice is swathed in a 50s-style reverb, the instrumentation and string arrangements are very mid-60s, but when they lock into a groove and trance out (like on What Colour Are You?) it could have been made last week. It\u2019s not only my favourite Bob Lind album; it\u2019s one of my favourite albums, full stop.

Before its release, Robert Wyatt was known to me as drummer and co-vocalist of Soft Machine, through listening to John Peel, who almost single-handedly championed him throughout his solo career. Peel brought Wyatt further attention, particularly in 1983 when his original version of Elvis Costello and Clive Langer\u2019s Falklands war-inspired song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoZiOOD0HRU\">Shipbuilding</a> reached <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/festive50s/\">No 2 in his Festive 50</a>. By that time, I was already well under the influence of Nothing Can Stop Us. It was on my Walkman throughout that summer, usually as I hoofed it on a daily basis from Paddington up to Shepherd\u2019s Bush, where my mates and I were busy occupying ourselves with the recording of a bunch of songs that would be released as New Gold Dream. I loved listening to the album in its entirety, and repeatedly so. I still do. Why? You could begin by listening to At Last I Am Free, followed by Strange Fruit, and then the aforementioned Shipbuilding. And perhaps like me you, too, will get a lump in the throat listening to what was surely a purposefully pale and wan rendition of Red Flag. I don\u2019t think Robert Wyatt knows how great an artist he really is.</p> <h2>Green Gartside of Scritti Politti on \u2026</h2> <p><strong>The Clark Sisters: Is My Living In Vain (Sound of Gospel, 1980)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWtrpuPHDcM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pWtrpuPHDcM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Click to hear the Clark Sisters\u2019 Is My Living in Vain?</figcaption> </figure>   <p>This was given to me by a writer I met in New York in about 1982: this recording of rapturous devotion to God has abided with me ever since. It\u2019s <em>so</em> good \u2026 it almost passeth all understanding. Taped live in 1979 at Detroit\u2019s Bailey Cathedral, Elbernita \u201cTwinkie\u201d Clark with her four sisters and their mother, group founder Dr Mattie Moss Clark, perform some of the most ineffably sublime music I have ever heard. As funky as grandpa\u2019s drawers and with an ecstatic sense of yearning, the sisters\u2019 goosebump-inducing singing \u2013 sometimes fragile, sometimes fearsome \u2013 is put to the service of eight exquisitely crafted paeans to the Lord. You can find a clip of the sisters in their floor-length pastel chiffon gowns performing a version of the album\u2019s title song on YouTube, which is magnificent but only hints at the record\u2019s treasures. In 1983, the Clark Sisters performed at the Grammys, provoking the ire of their church, which forbade Mattie Moss from ever performing with her daughters again. Her singing of They Were Overcome on this album is one of the loveliest things I know. A couple of years after I was first given the record, the sisters came to London to sing at [the] Westminster Hall. After their astonishing appearance I approached them to express my admiration and gratitude. I was invited to visit the family next day at a house in Tottenham, or maybe it was Finsbury Park. I\u2019m sure I was a nuisance but they were gracious and I was blessed with some albums from their back catalogue.

Most dancehall albums at that time were usually a collection of hits that were already out but this was made up of new material. When I got home and put it on the stereo, it was mind-blowing. Buju was in full-on rasta mode and every single song was absolute fire. The consciousness was turned all the way up. Even on the party songs and girl tunes he was talking from a higher perspective. Champion and Murderer may have been the hardcore boom shots that everyone knows but Til I\u2019m Laid to Rest and Not an Easy Road spoke to me deeply and truly inspired me even more to pursue music. Everyone needs to listen to this dancehall reggae gem and see who Buju Banton really is.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/feb/15/on-my-radar-faris-badwan-the-horrors\">Faris Badwan</a> of Cat\u2019s Eyes and the Horrors on \u2026</h2> <p><strong>Faine Jade: Introspection: A Faine Jade Recital (Sandiland, 1968)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dgz8xjbp60Y\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Dgz8xjbp60Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Click to hear Faine Jade\u2019s Don\u2019t Hassle Me.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>This is one of my favourite psychedelic records \u2013 and one of the rarest. Get it now! It has the visceral edge of the Velvet Underground in places and the wistfulness of Syd Barrett in others. Faine Jade is effectively a solo project from Chuck Laskowski, a Long Island-based singer and guitarist who previously released one single with the Rustics in 1966. Barrett similarities run through the record; one of my favourite things about Syd\u2019s songs is the feeling that they could go in any direction, at any moment. They are totally tense, raw and unpredictable, and the songs on Introspection follow a similar creative path. Laskowski claims to have been unaware of Pink Floyd at the time, which is totally believable as the tracks never stray into homage territory. While seeking to emulate some of the British psych sounds of the time, Introspection retains the identity of late-60s amphetamine-driven US garage. Don\u2019t Hassle Me captures the spirit of rebellious youth, and Ballad of the Bad Guys is a burst of garage rock that Between the Buttons-era Rolling Stones fans will be into. The tension reaches its height on People Games Play, a song that combines the \u201costrich guitar\u201d strumming of Lou Reed with familiar late-60s percussion and unsettling, monotone vocals. There\u2019s definitely a bit of the Byrds in here as well. The lyrics are fairly typical of the Timothy Leary era, with mystical lines such as, \u201cTrim the wick with scarlet scissors,\u201d but they fit the mood. Laskowski went on to release an album with the country rock band Dustbowl Clementine in 1970 but has since been largely inactive. More recently, Faine Jade gained wider exposure as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/mgmt\">MGMT</a> covered the folk-rock title track Introspection on their debut Oracular Spectacular. Laskowski even gave his seal of approval by appearing with them on the closing date of their accompanying US tour.</p> <h2>Petula Clark on \u2026</h2> <p><strong>Michel Colombier: Wings (A&amp;M, 1971)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYIHAFWUo_k\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AYIHAFWUo_k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Click here to hear Emmanuel by Michel Colombier.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Herb Alpert produced this album, mostly in LA and Paris. It was a hugely expensive project, a mixture of jazz, rock, symphonic, with fantastic people on it \u2013 Bill Medley, Paul Williams \u2013 and some great jazz musicians. It\u2019s one of those masterpieces that isn\u2019t what you\u2019d call a commercial record, but it\u2019s one of my favourites. I love Herb, and Michel, who was a great composing talent. It was a bit of a love-in! There\u2019s some amazing music on it: very moving \u2013 there\u2019s a song on it called Emmanuel, for Michel\u2019s son, who died very young \u2013 but it also rocks like mad. It was very personal to Michel, who was a very unusual musician. He was often in another place, another world. It was made for pure pleasure. You could call it a kind of folly.</p> <h2>Alexis Taylor of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/hot-chip\">Hot Chip</a> on \u2026</h2> <p><strong>Franco Battiato: Foetus (Sony/BMG Italy, 1971)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfiv4a4vabM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Qfiv4a4vabM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Click to hear Karyokinesis by Franco Battiato. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s progressive rock but more short song-based than overblown 15-minute rock like Yes, Genesis or ELP. He\u2019s a composer and songwriter who\u2019s still one of Italy\u2019s best-known musicians; a sort of Italian Peter Gabriel. He moved away from this strange experimental record towards a more poppy, new wave direction; Foetus is his first solo album. It\u2019s a very beautiful-sounding, analogue synth-based record, but also very pop: the songs are very immediate, melodic and easy on the ear. The Italian version was the first one I really loved; then I came across the English version and that suddenly opened it up; now I knew what the songs were about. It\u2019s a very original take on describing your place in the world; not your usual singer-songwriter confessionals. It\u2019s similar to the experimental pop approach of a Brian Wilson mixed with someone like Jim O\u2019Rourke from 90s underground Chicago.</p> <h2>Alexis Krauss of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/sleigh-bells\">Sleigh Bells</a> on \u2026</h2> <p><strong>Eccentric Soul: The Deep City Label (Numero Group, 2006)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh-2_kdVcyA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vh-2_kdVcyA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Click to hear Betty Wright\u2019s Clean Up Woman.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The Numero Group collect really old compilations from obscure labels no longer in existence. This album is all of the tracks from a soul label based in Miami called Deep City; most of the music is mid-to-late-60s. A lot of the players were part of Florida marching bands \u2013 the cover of the album shows them wearing the most sick, badass uniforms \u2013 who later went on to run more successful studios that released funk and disco. This predates that stuff; it\u2019s tracks that had no commercial success, but it does feature artists such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/feb/16/cult-heroes-betty-wright-soul-golden-agony-aunt\">Betty Wright</a>. It\u2019s similar to what was going on in Detroit, only a little funkier. It\u2019s a little rough around the edges, but if you like old soul, it\u2019s great.</p> <h2>Andrew Savage of Parquet Courts on \u2026</h2> <p><strong>The Necessaries: Event Horizon (Sire, 1982)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTcx71TB2w\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SoTcx71TB2w?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Click to hear Driving and Talking at the Same Time by he Necessaries.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>This is a record that has even evaded diehard fans of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/17/arthur-russell-alexis-taylor-devandra-banhart\">Arthur Russell</a>, who played keyboards in the group during their short lifespan and wrote two of the album\u2019s best songs: Driving and Talking at the Same Time and More Real. When I listen to Event Horizon, I marvel that it isn\u2019t one of the most influential records in rock music. But it didn\u2019t make the impact it intended to, and was forgotten by Sire and eventually by fans. Russell went on to a celebrated solo career after quitting the band by jumping out of the van at the mouth of the Holland Tunnel in New York, while on the way to a gig in New Jersey. But this is a record that needs to be examined further by anybody interested in this era of rock music. It\u2019s an elusive missing piece to the lore of the downtown scene. Everyone who walks through the door of my apartment is subjected to and is changed by it.</p> <h2>Mark Stewart of the Pop Group on \u2026</h2> <p><strong>The Fire This Time: Dancing On John Wayne\u2019s Head (Extreme, 1995)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m9yCWvOIzM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5m9yCWvOIzM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Click to hear Thee Fire This Time\u2019s Reluctant Warrior.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s a shining example of an activist-musician using art as a weapon. The guy who got it together is Pat Andrade, who organises indigenous resistance, helping Aboriginal people, with songs about native rights issues and the way corporations own the government. In the punk days, people tended to wear politics like a haircut, but Pat actually walks what he talks. He was influenced by us [Pop Group/On-U Sound] to a certain extent. There are loads of guests \u2013 Augustus Pablo, Chuck D, Mikey Dread \u2013 on this album. He\u2019s a real internationalist; a dub activist. It\u2019s resistance through reggae. What he\u2019s talking about is really real.</p> <h2>Charlie Simpson of Busted and Fightstar on \u2026</h2> <p><strong>Aereogramme: A Story In White (Chemikal Underground, 2001)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkxyglTS6UY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vkxyglTS6UY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Click to hear Aereogramme\u2019s The Question is Complete.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>When people talk about artists who don\u2019t get the recognition they deserve, Aereogramme are always the first band I think of. It\u2019s a stunning record, so different to anything I\u2019d heard before: atmospheric, with beautiful melodies and really heavy riffs. I got into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/mogwai\">Mogwai</a> through my brother when I was 11 or 12 and I thought it would be great to have that sort of music with vocals and Aereogramme did just that. I love the contrast of light and dark. It was definitely an influence on Fightstar. Funnily enough, Iain Cook the guitarist, is now in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/chvrches\">Chvrches</a>, so he did finally get some recognition.</p> <h2>Shirley Manson of Garbage on \u2026</h2> <p><strong>Hey!

Back then she appeared to come from Mars: she was like a female David Bowie to me. I worked in Miss Selfridge and she came into the store one day and I kept staring at her. Later I got introduced to her at a club and became obsessed with her and her band. I still think they deserve more recognition; they were a fantastic pop band. The record was produced by Tony Visconti and Martin Rushent, and the result is a strange mix of white funk, jangly 80s guitar, catchy pop and synths, with girl group harmonies and some \u201calternative\u201d flavour. They flamed brightly for a few minutes then seemed to disappear, but they\u2019re really unique.</p> <h2>Rebecca Ferguson on \u2026</h2> <p><strong>Lisa Gerrard: The Best of (4AD, 2007)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGmvXGBBfjs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JGmvXGBBfjs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Click to hear Lisa Gerrard\u2019s Sanvean.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>She used to sing with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJhVM930YXY\">Dead Can Dance</a>. She is kind of classical and sings in her own language that she makes up. She works a lot with Hans Zimmer and she\u2019s just unreal. She did the theme from Gladiator, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBE-uBgtINg\">Now We Are Free</a>. That made me want to find out more about her. I really like the song Sanvean (I Am Your Shadow). It\u2019s quite dark; heavy and emotional. It creates a mood and it\u2019s moving. To me, she\u2019s one of the best vocalists of all time. If someone went on The X Factor and sang Now We Are Free, it would be unbelievable. It\u2019s whether the audience are ready for that.</p> <h2>Gilbert O\u2019Sullivan on \u2026</h2> <p><strong>Carole King: Writer (Ode, 1970)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14w7MVUS4Fc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/14w7MVUS4Fc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Click to hear Carole King\u2019s Goin\u2019 Back.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>This was Carole King\u2019s album before Tapestry, which I don\u2019t think anybody bought apart from me and a couple of other people. She made an album before it, in 1968, with a group called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCR5syrzWw4\">the City</a> because she didn\u2019t really like being a frontperson. But Writer was significant because it was the prelude to Tapestry. There are some wonderful songs here such as Up on the Roof and Goin\u2019 Back \u2013 covers of her own songs. But the album only sold about 10 or 20,000 whereas Tapestry sold 10 or 20m! James Taylor is on it, and [guitarist] Danny Kortchmar; a lot of the same people who were on Tapestry. It\u2019s a really lovely album. It definitely influenced my writing, particularly the chord sequences on Child of Mine. If I\u2019d grown my hair and worn jeans and a denim shirt I would have easily fitted into that category of singer-songwriter. But I dared to be different and chose an unusual image.</p> <h2>Stuart Braithwaite of Mogwai on \u2026</h2> <p><strong>Abner Jay: True Story of Abner Jay (Mississippi, 2009)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKpflHueZAk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RKpflHueZAk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Click to hear Abner Jay\u2019s I\u2019m So Depressed.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>This is the only record I own that I love that has jokes on. I tend to like miserable, depressing, pretentious music. Abner Jay was a one-man-band, who classed himself as an entertainer \u2013 \u201cThe last great southern black minstrel show,\u201d as he described himself. He\u2019d move from town to town, selling vinyl records and cassettes that he published on his own label. It\u2019s folk-blues; the kind of thing that, when you hear it, you can\u2019t believe it hasn\u2019t sold a million copies. It\u2019s a guy singing his heart out, playing amazing music. The songs are absolutely incredible, poignant, dark, really captivating and wild. He wrote them about Vietnam, cocaine, the moon landing. My favourite one on this album is I\u2019m So Depressed. That\u2019s the one that blew me away. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a joke, but it\u2019s really moving.</p>",

She was not a member of our group in the House of Lords; she was an independent peer, she has had her membership suspended.</p> <p>\u201cWe take her comments very seriously and have acted accordingly.\u201d </p> <p>Tonge was Lib Dem MP for Richmond Park from 1997 to 2005, but has sat as an independent in the Lords since she was suspended in 2012, also for allegedly antisemitic comments.</p> <p>Thursday\u2019s move came after Tonge hosted a meeting at the House of Lords this week at which Israel was reportedly compared to terror group Islamic State and Jews were blamed for the Holocaust. The remarks were made by an attendee at the meeting, which was organised by the Palestinian Return Centre, which live-streamed the event on its Facebook page. (In a subsequent statement, the Palestinian Return Centre said it did not tolerate any form of antisemitism or Holocaust denial statements.)</p> <p>The Israeli embassy in London said the meeting was a \u201cshameful event which gave voice to racist tropes against Jews and Israelis alike\u201d.</p> <p>Tory MP David Davies called in the House of Commons for a debate \u201con the use to which these premises may be put following reports that outrageously a member of the House of Lords presided over an event at which Israel was compared to Islamic State, and the Jews were even blamed for their own genocide\u201d.</p> <p>Tonge also recently released a letter in which she blamed a rise in antisemitism on Israel\u2019s treatment of Palestinians. She published the letter online and said she had submitted it to the Guardian, which confirmed it had been received on 16 October.</p> <p>The letter said: \u201cIt is surely the case these [antisemitic] incidents are reflecting the disgust amongst the general public of the way the government of Israel treats Palestinians and manipulates the USA and ourselves to take no action against the country\u2019s blatant disregard of international law and the Geneva conventions.\u201d</p> <p>The peer has a long track record of making trenchant criticisms of Israel. In 2004, when she was an MP, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3421669.stm\">she was sacked from the frontbench</a> by then party leader Charles Kennedy after she suggested that she would become a suicide bomber if she was Palestinian. At the time, Israel had endured repeated suicide bombings carried out by Palestinians during the second intifada. She was made a peer the following year.</p> <p>Last month, the current Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, was questioned by the home affairs select committee as part of its investigation into antisemitism over Tonge\u2019s continued membership of the party.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the committee published a report on antisemitism, which called on all political parties to tackle what it described as a \u201cpernicious form of hate\u201d. </p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/16/jeremy-corbyn-antisemitism-chakrabarti-inquiry\">MPs focused criticism on Jeremy Corbyn </a>and the Labour party. \u201cThe failure of the Labour party consistently and effectively to deal with antisemitic incidents in recent years risks lending force to allegations that elements of the Labour movement are institutionally antisemitic,\u201d they concluded.</p> <p>The report adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance\u2019s definition of antisemitism as \u201ca certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities\u201d.</p> <p>However, MPs added it was not antisemitic \u201cto criticise the government of Israel, without additional evidence to suggest antisemitic intent\u201d. Neither was it antisemitic \u201cto hold the Israeli government to the same standards as other liberal democracies, or to take a particular interest in the Israeli government\u2019s policies or actions, without additional evidence to suggest antisemitic intent.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 31 October 2016 to clarify that the offensive remarks had been made by an attendee not an official speaker, and to include the subsequent statement by the Palestinian Return Centre dissociating itself from the remarks.<br></p>",

We understand specialist facilities have been made available elsewhere in France to ensure this happens.\u201d</p> <p>The clear implication of the pressure from the home secretary is that the promised buses should be provided for those refugee children who have been pushed outside the camp to take them to a new reception centre.</p> <p>The Home Office confirmed that a further group of Calais children arrived in Croydon on Thursday with more expected in the coming days.</p> <p>The call followed renewed pressure from amongst others Yvette Cooper, the chair of the Commons home affairs committee. She said had been in touch again with Home Office ministers to urge them to put serious pressure on the French authorities to provide an immediate safe place for children to go.</p> <p>\u201cThey also need to accelerate the British assessments and transfers to get more children and teenagers into stable accommodation and to urgently free up more places in the container camp too,\u201d Cooper said.</p> <p>\u201cChildren need safe accommodation to stay in tonight \u2013 they cannot be left to sleep rough by the side of the road again.

Here\u2019s a few sections from it: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The EU is a flawed institution, but we judged it better to fight for its reform than to leave. By a majority, the referendum shows that the British people made a different choice.</p> <p>Britain voted to leave the EU, and that decision should be and must be respected. We have to now think about what Britain after Brexit will be like.</p> <p>As the negotiations get underway, we will face a series of choices. \u201cHard\u201d versus \u201csoft\u201d Brexit does not cover it. We will need to decide on our openness to trade, investment, and migration.</p> <p>Labour will always prioritise supporting jobs, growth, and the public finances in making those choices. </p> <p>But this is not only about getting the best possible deal for the British people in any negotiations. It is about our values, and who we are as a society. It is about our identity, as much as it is about the kind of economy we live in.</p> </blockquote> <p>And:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There ought to be a political consensus on finding a deal that protects jobs, prosperity, and the public finances. Yet there is a minority Tory opinion that favours a scorched earth approach. They are making the running in the government\u2019s own Brexit negotiations.</p> <p>The government is hurtling towards a chaotic Brexit that will damage our economy, and hurt the poorest and most vulnerable most of all. By pulling up the drawbridge and tearing up longstanding ties to Europe, we will inflict huge and unnecessary pain on our society.</p> <p>Yet a hard-line Tory minority believe that if we allow market forces to tear through our society in the wake of Brexit, we will emerge a more productive society. It is the fantasy of turning our whole country into a giant offshore tax haven, with rock-bottom wages and no public services....</p> <p>Let me be clear: those who voted Conservative in 2015 are not the same as the Tory establishment. Like me, you will have friends who have voted Conservative. They don\u2019t want a bankers\u2019 Brexit any more than I do.</p> <p>The simple truth is that the Tory establishment cannot be trusted to make a success of Brexit. They want to take control for themselves, not the many. They want to turn Britain into a Singapore of the north Atlantic.</p> </blockquote> <p>And:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are also committed to making sure that Brexit works for everyone not an elite few. The Tories want to cut special deals for bankers, and cut taxes for big multinationals.</p> <p>Labour would work with our European neighbours to protect our key industries like steel, and negotiate deals with the EU to make sure big multinationals like Google pay their fair share in tax.</p> <p>Labour will take back the economic levers of power currently in the hands of the EU, such as state aid rules, and return them to the people.</p> <p>Not a bankers\u2019 Brexit for the lucky few, but a people\u2019s Brexit for the many.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5811f3e1e4b01c528432d42a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-27T12:39:38.371Z\">1.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Business secretary refuses to say if Nissan was granted special deal</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a7647c5c9a4259a94e2f6f3ea70ce1ffd5c7d73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a7647c5c9a4259a94e2f6f3ea70ce1ffd5c7d73/0_9_3351_2011/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The business secretary Greg Clark.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The business secretary Greg Clark.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The business secretary, <strong>Greg Clark</strong>, has just treated listeners of BBC Radio 4\u2019s World at One to a masterclass in political waffling. By my count, host Martha Kearney asked him six times whether the government had struck some sort of deal with Nissan over potential post-Brexit tariffs to persuade the carmaker to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/nissan-to-make-new-qashqai-and-x-trail-models-in-britain\">build new models in its Sunderland plant</a>. </p> <p>Each time Clark answered an entirely different question, and at great length. Not a man afraid of numerous sub-clauses in a sentence, he at times resembled a contestant on another Radio 4 show, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006s5dp\">Just a Minute</a>, seeking to run down the clock without actually saying anything of note.</p> <p>To give you a flavour, here\u2019s Clark\u2019s first two answers, in full:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think we\u2019ve established a clear understanding of the seriousness of the government\u2019s intention to make sure that the car manufacturing industry not only retains its competitiveness, but actually, through our commitment through the industrial strategy we\u2019re developing for investment in research and innovation and science \u2013 especially on very important technologies like electric vehicles \u2013 that we are going to be even more a magnet for investment in the future.</p> <p>And over the weeks that I\u2019ve been having conversations with Nissan, and indeed other companies, I think we do have mutual confidence that this is going to be a very exciting place to invest, and that\u2019s what we agreed.</p> </blockquote> <p>And:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We talked about the Brexit negotiation and obviously it is something that was in their minds, but the first thing we were able to show was that we are absolutely determined to do a good deal with our European friends and neighbours. </p> <p>There\u2019s strong mutual interest in the automotive sector in particular, where there is mutual exporting from one country to another, and from Britain to the rest of the EU, supply chains are quite integrated. So we not only have the ambition and the intention but actually good grounds for looking forwards to a good relationship here.</p> </blockquote> <p>A bit later, Clark came close to an actual answer on one point, saying there had not been a specific deal on compensation over possible tariffs, but that was as precise as it got:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s no question of financial compensation over tariffs, because we\u2019ve said that what is necessary is that we are going to maintain the competitiveness of the sector.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-27T12:44:35.371Z\">at 1.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5811ed26e4b08d944ba4b3bc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-27T12:05:40.121Z\">1.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"273cb99052b55f5defb9d0c391cb24280791e532\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/273cb99052b55f5defb9d0c391cb24280791e532/0_75_3670_2202/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m still lacking a copy of John McDonnell\u2019s Brexit speech, but here are some more full quotes from it via PA:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Labour are not about to make cynical promises like the Conservatives on reducing migrant numbers, knowing full well they can\u2019t be met on the scale, or timescale, with the methods they propose.</p> <p>It is not migrants [who are] to blame for low pay and insecurity at work, or the high cost of housing, it is the failure of our whole economic model, which is not supplying the investment in work, or in housing, that people need. We have to change the model.</p> <p>What we experienced during the referendum ... people voted on a whole range of issues, one of which was their concern about the low standard of living. They actually looked at migration being exploited by employers and others to undermine that standard of living. </p> <p>What we will negotiate is a future with Europe that protects people\u2019s standards of living, that doesn\u2019t allow migration to be used and exploited in that way.

We have to have a comprehensive plan, and this is chaos at the moment.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cWe are trying to get a consensus and heal the divisions the referendum brought and we cannot do that with secret deals behind closed doors. It will divide our country once more. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe first deal looked like it would be protecting financial services, paid for by others. And now with Nissan, other manufacturers are saying what are we going to get? We have to have a comprehensive plan. What we need is more openness and transparency and accountability.\u201d<br></p> <p>However, Labour\u2019s mayor of London Sadiq Khan is set to call on the government to prioritise the City\u2019s EU passporting rights at a speech at the City of London Corporation\u2019s annual dinner tonight.<br></p> <p>McDonnell said he was also determined to protect financial services, but would not prioritise a \u201cbankers\u2019 Brexit\u201d over other industries. \u201cIt sends out messages to the rest of our economy that special deals are being cooked up.

  "<p>Campaigners are calling on the UK to prevent vulture funds from using British courts to pursue the debts of poor countries after it emerged that Mozambique could be the first in a wave of states facing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/10/poorer-countries-commodity-slump-stronger-dollar-debt-payments\">new debt crisis</a> sparked by the commodity price crash.<br></p> <p>Mozambique, one of the world\u2019s fastest growing economies for much of the past decade, admitted on Tuesday that its debt levels are unsustainable and that it must restructure repayments if it is to receive further aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Like many poor countries, Mozambique is vulnerable to falling commodity prices and higher interest rates. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/10/poorer-countries-commodity-slump-stronger-dollar-debt-payments\">World's poorest countries rocked by commodity slump and strong dollar</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The country\u2019s government <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mozambique-loans-idUSKCN0XK0FD\">revealed in April</a> that it had secretly taken out loans of $1.1bn (\u00a3901m) from two London-based banks, Credit Suisse and Russia\u2019s VTB bank. All of its private external debt is now owed under English law, enabling vulture funds and others who have bought the debts cheaply to shun the restructuring process and instead sue Mozambique in UK courts.</p> <p>VTB said in a statement that its loans were executed in compliance with appropriate polices, and that the government of Mozambique had confirmed it was adhering to internal and external legislation by disclosing comprehensive information to creditors and investors. </p> <p>\u201cEssentially, the government misled us,\u201d said VTB. \u201cInvestors should be protected, debts need to be repaid, and the IMF should be informed about loans in time.\u201d</p> <p>VTB said it no longer owned a loan extended to state-owned Mozambique Asset Management, the debt having been transferred to other regional investors. The bank added that it was not deserting investors, to whom it remained responsible as creditor and agent on the relevant bonds, and said it would continue to engage in constructive dialogue with Mozambique\u2019s ministry of economy and finance and its advisers.</p> <p>Credit Suisse declined to comment.</p> <p>The Jubilee Debt Campaign called on the UK government to extend a 2010 law \u2013 currently only applicable to loans granted before 2004 \u2013 that protects countries from such actions. Pointing out that 90% of sub-Saharan African government bonds are owed under English law, the pressure group pointed to Ghana and Mozambique as early warning signs of a far greater developing world debt crisis on the horizon.</p> <p>\u201cTo help break this boom-bust cycle of debt crises, the UK needs to legislate that all loans given to governments under English law have to be publicly disclosed at the time the loan is given, so that the UK cannot again be complicit in hiding public debts,\u201d said Jubilee in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no reason why those who lent at high interest rates to a government whose ability to repay was clearly dependent on continued high commodity prices should be repaid. They took a bet, and it has not come off.\u201d</p> <p>In its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/21/united-nations-unctadwarns-debt-crisis-poor-developing-countries-oil-prices\">annual report</a> last month, the UN conference on trade and development <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://unctad.org/en/Pages/Home.aspx\">(Unctad)</a> raised fears of a fresh debt crisis in developing countries that could send shockwaves through the global financial system. The organisation also said the benefits of debt relief provided to some of the world\u2019s poorest countries following mass public campaigns either side of the year 2000 were \u201cfast evaporating\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Mozambique has pledged to honour what it described as illegal debt contracts to state-owned companies. While acknowledging the attraction of defaulting on some payments, Prime Minister Carlos Agostinho do Ros\u00e1rio told Mozambique\u2019s parliament that the \u201cgood image of the country among international creditors\u201d would be hurt if the government failed to make good on guarantees.</p>",
  "<p>Vladimir Putin has denied that Russia has interfered in the US election, claiming that those who believed Moscow could influence the vote were implying the US was a \u201cbanana republic\u201d. Putin dismissed claims of Russian meddling as \u201chysteria\u201d and lectured the US on democracy. He also denied that Donald Trump was the Kremlin\u2019s favoured candidate, though he praised the tycoon\u2019s controversial campaign.</p> <p>In a speech to an annual gathering of Russian and foreign politicians and analysts in Sochi on Thursday, Putin attacked the US over its foreign policy in recent years. \u201cDoes anyone seriously think that Russia can affect the choice of the American people? What, is America a banana republic? America\u2019s a great power. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The US government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election\">formally accused</a> Russia of hacking into the Democratic party\u2019s servers, and there has been scrutiny of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-paul-manafort-ukraine-russia-putin-ties\">Russian links</a> among some of Trump\u2019s former and current campaign staff.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/24/cold-war-20-how-russia-and-the-west-reheated-a-historic-struggle\">Cold war 2.0: how Russia and the west reheated a historic struggle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Russian president criticised the tone of the US campaign and suggested there was little difference between the candidates. \u201cElections have ceased to be an instrument of change, and are all about scandals, about blackmail, and discussion of who groped whom and who is sleeping with whom,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>Asked whether Trump was the Kremlin\u2019s favourite, Putin said this was a fake narrative cooked up by western media. \u201cIt\u2019s total nonsense. It\u2019s just a form of manipulating public opinion,\u201d he said. Nevertheless, Russian state media has made no secret of its preference for Trump, and has suggested the election may be rigged in Hillary Clinton\u2019s favour.<br></p> <p>Putin also praised Trump\u2019s style and campaign: \u201cHe chose his own way of reaching voters\u2019 hearts. Of course he\u2019s behaving extravagantly, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily without reason. I think he is representing the interests of that part of the American electorate, and it\u2019s a significant part, that is tired of the same elite who have been in power for decades. He is representing the interests of ordinary people.\u201d </p> <p>At the same time, he claimed there was little difference between Trump and Clinton: \u201cIf you look at the programmes of the different candidates, you get the feeling that they are all tailored in the same way, and that the differences between them are insignificant, and in reality there are no differences.\u201d</p> <p>Putin said the US had a number of problems, including huge debt and gun crime, and that politicians had no answers. \u201cThere is nothing to calm society with, and so it\u2019s easier to distract people with supposed Russian hackers, spies and agents of interest.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>The last time many people would have caught a glimpse of Michael Gove was on the morning after the EU referendum when he appeared before the TV cameras looking like a bloke who had just come down from a bad acid trip to discover he had murdered several of his closest friends. </p> <p>That, though, turned out to be just the start of his Charlie Manson political killing spree. Within a week, he had stabbed Boris Johnson repeatedly in the front before crashing and burning in his bid to become prime minister. His punishment was to be sent to the backbenches to reflect on the foolishness of his actions.</p> <p>As justice secretary, Gove was a firm believer in the saying, \u201cIf you can\u2019t do the time, don\u2019t do the crime,\u201d but he\u2019s not finding it so easy to put into practice himself.</p> <p>The normal sentence for a serial killer is life without parole, but Gove has come to the conclusion that, in his case, a couple of months is quite long enough. Mikey has had enough of being just another political hack, occasionally chipping in with backbench speeches that go unreported and unappreciated. Mikey believes he is worth more than this. Mikey believes the world is ready for The Return of the Govester. Mikey 2.0.</p> <p>Sadly for Mikey, just about the only person to agree with him is the Brexit-supporting Labour peer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/jul/19/lord-glasman-radical-traditionalist\">Maurice Glasman</a>, and the pair have set up a two-man commission to \u201cDo Something About Immigration\u201d. Which is why Mikey finally got the attention he had been craving for so long and was invited to appear on Sky News. </p> <p>Sometimes you have to be careful what you wish for. There are some humiliations even a politician shouldn\u2019t be made to endure. \u201cLet\u2019s just remind ourselves of one of the most momentous occasions of this summer,\u201d said Sky\u2019s Adam Boulton, not even bothering to conceal a smirk. The screen switched to Boris Johnson announcing he wasn\u2019t going to run for leadership of the Conservative party after all. \u201cWhat did you think when you saw that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t watch it,\u201d Gove insisted.</p> <p>Boulton arched an eyebrow. Was Mikey really trying to suggest he hadn\u2019t bothered to watch Boris: My Part in His Downfall? No matter. Boulton pressed on.</p> <p>\u201cBut you did effectively bring about Boris\u2019s withdrawal from the leadership race?\u201d he observed.</p> <p>\u201cThat was a complete coincidence,\u201d said Mikey.</p> <p>\u201cTreachery. Nicking his phone. Conspiracy ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s an unfair characterisation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo there was no betrayal by you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. The mistake I made was that I should have paused before offering Boris support.\u201d </p> <p>Or, indeed, before withdrawing it. It\u2019s fair to say Mikey has a bit of a way to go in his rehabilitation classes. Restorative justice must be on next year\u2019s curriculum.</p> <p>Boulton pressed on for an easy kill of his own. \u201cSo, what was your biggest mistake?\u201d he enquired. \u201cSupporting Boris, knifing Boris or thinking you were fit to be prime minister?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did come third,\u201d Mikey squeaked, defiantly.</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/02/andrea-leadsom-v-theresa-may\">But more MPs believed <em>even</em> Andrea Leadsom was a better bet than you</a>.\u201d That was the lowest of low blows. Living with the knowledge your colleagues have more faith in the environment minister\u2019s competency is enough to keep anyone in therapy for decades.</p> <p>Boulton\u2019s bloodlust was out of control. Gove had been a key man and was now excluded. Boris was foreign secretary and doing well and Gove wasn\u2019t. \u201cYou\u2019re left to going around bayoneting the wounded,\u201d he said, oblivious to the irony he was guilty of doing just that himself.</p> <p>By now, Mikey was a wreck, praying for the interview to end as quickly as possible. He\u2019d only imagined doing a three-minute interview and it was already creeping up to 10. Mikey found himself babbling stuff he knew that even he didn\u2019t believe. \u201cIt\u2019s great news the pound has been devalued by 30%,\u201d he insisted.</p> <p>\u201cSo, what are the immigration targets of your new commission?\u201d asked Boulton, finally getting round to the reason Mikey had volunteered himself for this debacle.</p> <p>\u201cUm ... er ... I don\u2019t really know. That\u2019s why I want to have a commission.\u201d</p> <p>As Mikey tiptoed out of the studios, his phone rang. Maybe it was Theresa asking him back into the cabinet, having been dazzled by his performance. It wasn\u2019t. It was his probation officer. His licence had been revoked.</p>",
  "<p>When he was a child, Adnan Siddiqui would take the longer route from his home to watch Crystal Palace play football. The short route would pass The Victory pub, from which racists would jeer at him. He smiles at the thought that this same pub is now a mosque, the Thornton Heath Islamic Centre. Not that the racism has vanished from the pubs of his part of south London. Last Christmas a young Muslim was out in the pubs collecting for an African clean water charity \u2013 \u201ctrying to show people that not all Muslim people are bloody Isis\u201d \u2013 but that made no difference to the man who punched him to the ground, racially insulting him as he fell. It was one small incident among a great many. The monitoring group <a href=\"http://tellmamauk.org\" title=\"\">Tell Mama</a> found a whopping 326% rise in hate crime directed at Muslims in 2015. And it\u2019s getting worse.</p> <p>Dr Siddiqui is now the local GP in the area he grew up. But what he\u2019s better known for is setting up Cage Prisoners. One of the most widely disparaged of advocacy organisations, now simply called <a href=\"http://cage.ngo/dr-adnan-2/?mode=grid\" title=\"\">Cage</a>, their aim is to support those impacted by the war on terror, documenting abuses and insisting that all should have equal access to the rule of law.</p> <p>They began with a particular concern for those kidnapped by the US and taken to Guant\u00e1namo Bay; too innocent to be put before a court of law, allegedly too dangerous to release. And, given the nature of this work, Cage inevitably stand alongside a whole range of people, from those who are innocent and have been wrongly targeted to those who are much more dangerous. Of course, it is the job of the law to distinguish between the two. Which is why the rule of law must pertain \u2013 exactly what Cage&#xa0;argue&#xa0;for.</p> <p>But in making this case they have been derided, including by David Cameron no less, as dangerous terrorist sympathisers. And yes, Cage advocates have said some silly things in the past, for instance that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/02/who-is-mohammed-emwazi-from-lovely-boy-to-islamic-state-executioner\" title=\"\">\u201cJihadi John\u201d</a> was \u201cextremely gentle\u201d before his radicalisation. They might even be right \u2013 evil can work into even the gentlest soul \u2013 but it was unwise. And yes, of course Cage condemn people like him too. But so nervous are some of the work they do that no UK bank is willing to provide them with an account. You&#xa0;can imagine how much HMRC loves the idea that Cage can only offer to pay their taxes in cash or gifted jewellery.</p> <p>Margaret Thatcher once accused Amnesty International of being \u201cIRA apologists\u201d for challenging the extrajudicial killing by the SAS of three IRA members in Gibraltar in 1988. Cage are doing much the same thing as Amnesty, except in the even more febrile environment of the war on terror. And they are described in much the same way.</p> <p>I meet Dr Siddiqui for a biryani next to the East London mosque. Because I\u2019m carrying too many assumptions, his accent \u2013 a cross between public schoolboy and south Londoner \u2013 catches me by surprise. I inquire further. He went to Dulwich College, he explains \u2013 with Nigel Farage. \u201cHe was in the sixth form when I first arrived,\u201d Siddiqui says. He&#xa0;tells me he recalls Farage using words he found racially offensive, adding, \u201cand I remember the way he did it, gloating on each word\u201d. I am shocked but not surprised by this. \u201cYes, and he\u2019s a Palace fan too,\u201d Siddiqui then quips, lightening the mood.</p> <p>As Siddiqui leaves to say his prayers and I wander home, I recall A Man for All Seasons, Robert Bolt\u2019s play about Thomas More\u2019s trial for treason. There\u2019s a character who argues that it would be OK to disregard any law if chasing down the devil. It\u2019s the 16th-century equivalent to the view that it is OK to suspend the rule of law when chasing down terrorists. More replies: \u201cOh? And when the last law was down, and the devil turned round on you, where would you hide, the laws all being flat? \u2026 Yes, I\u2019d give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety\u2019s sake!\u201d</p> <p>This is exactly why Cage are right to insist that the law must apply even to those that the press and public opinion regularly demonise. Indeed, even to the devil himself.</p>",
  "<p>It could be goodbye, Roald Dahl and farewell, fairytales for children in daycare centres in the state of Washington, following the issue of new regulations suggesting: \u201cBooks that glorify violence in any way or show frightening images are not considered to be appropriate\u201d for young readers.</p> <p>Daycare nurseries in Washington can earn a state subsidy if they meet a series of requirements \u2013 one of which is to make \u201cappropriate books \u2026 accessible to children\u201d. While the guidelines, <a href=\"http://ncac.org/blog/washington-state-daycare-program-prohibits-kids-access-to-frightening-books\">as made public by the National Coalition Against Censorship</a> (NCAC), do not provide a list of books for nurseries, they do suggest that children should \u201clook closely at fables, fairytales, and nature/science books\u201d, and that \u201cbooks that glorify violence in any way or show frightening images are not considered to be appropriate\u201d. Earlier this summer, a UK-based survey found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/25/one-third-of-parents-avoid-reading-children-scary-stories-study-finds\">one third of parents also steer clear of reading their children books containing scary characters</a>.</p> <p>The NCAC warned that, while the new regulations are intended to steer children away from \u201cdisturbing\u201d material, they could \u201cend up forcing daycare providers into self-censoring the reading materials that they provide to young children\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cCountless pedagogically valuable books that cater to young audiences rely on images that toddlers might find frightening,\u201d said the free-speech organisation, pointing to books including Maurice Sendak\u2019s Where the Wild Things Are, fairytales such as Little Red Riding Hood and Hansel and Gretel, and nature books containing images of lions, bears or dinosaurs.</p> <p> \u201cThe effect of the \u2018frightening images\u2019 standard is thus that daycare providers may be, ironically, prevented from selecting many fairytales and nature/science books. Fairytales, of course, are full of scary images,\u201d said the NCAC. \u201cThe standard also prohibits books that depict or describe animals or people eating other animals or people. This would, naturally, impact science books covering the more Darwinian aspects of natural history and also fairytales like There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly.\u201d</p> <p>The organisation has contacted the Washington Library Association about the new policy, saying that while it \u201ctrusts Washington state\u2019s intentions \u2026 [it] expresses concern that its overbroad wording may impact a number of pedagogically beneficial books. Not to mention [that] the standards ignore the fact children may benefit from confronting their fears in safe and controlled environments.\u201d</p> <p>Psychologist Emma Kenny told the Guardian in August that \u201cfear is a natural response. And when you are reading a scary story to a child, or they\u2019re reading to themselves, the child has got a level of control \u2013 they can put it down, or ask you to stop. And the story can raise a discussion, in which they can explore and explain the way they feel about a situation.\u201d</p> <p>According to Daniel Radosh, a writer for The Daily Show With Trevor Noah, the struggle over children\u2019s reading extends well beyond early education. When his son brought home a slip requiring his parents to give their permission to allow him to read Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury\u2019s tale of a dystopian future where books are banned, Radosh\u2019s ironic response to the school went viral.</p> <p>\u201cWhat a wonderful way to introduce students to the theme of Fahrenheit 451 that books are so dangerous that the institutions of society \u2013 schools and parents \u2013 might be willing to team up against children to prevent them from reading one,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danielradosh/status/790568116023615488\">he wrote to his son\u2019s teacher</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s easy enough to read the book and say: \u2018This is crazy. It could never really happen,\u2019 but pretending to present students at the start with what seems like a totally reasonable \u2018first step\u2019 is a really immersive way to teach them how insidious censorship can be.\u201d<br></p> <p>The Guardian has approached Washington state authorities for comment.</p>",

The fact is, though, that it\u2019s the Toms\u2019 refusal to change a winning formula that makes them such a unique phenomenon. As Michael Douglas drifts towards retirement and Bruce Willis slides into direct-to-DVD purgatory, Cruise and Hanks stand as the only Hollywood megastars who still have their names above the titles of films, year upon year, long after they found fame in the 1980s. They are the last of their kind: the Tom Tom Club.</p> <p>At the start of 2016, Forbes ranked Cruise as the world\u2019s fourth highest-paid actor, and both Toms apparently offer their employers value for money. In January, a movie-business data analysis site, The Numbers, <a href=\"http://www.the-numbers.com/bankability\">totted up how much \u201csomeone adds in value to the film industry each year\u201d</a>, placing Cruise as the sixth most-bankable person in Hollywood, and Hanks as No 7. The Toms\u2019 onscreen charisma is the most obvious explanation for this Midas touch, of course, but it would be nothing without their uncanny ability to know exactly what audiences want from them, and to deliver it, time and time again. They aren\u2019t just actors, but auteurs. It is the Toms, rather than the directors or writers, who define their films.</p> <p>Even though Tom H is six years older than Tom C, there are plenty of parallels between them. Both spent their childhoods flitting from school to school. Both had youthful phases of devout Christianity: Cruise planned to be a Catholic priest, and Hanks has said that he was a \u201cBible-toting evangelical\u201d. Both had their first starring roles in romantic comedies opposite unconventional blonde beauties in the early 1980s: Cruise fell for a prostitute in Risky Business in 1983, Hanks for a mermaid in Splash in 1984. In the 1990s, their wage packets rocketed. Hanks is reported to have made $70m from Forrest Gump in 1994, Cruise made the same amount from Mission: Impossible in 1996. More significantly, both were nominated for Oscars throughout the 1990s, although while Hanks won two, Cruise has yet to pick up any. And both received their most recent Oscar nominations back in the early 00s.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/08/tom-hanks-speaks-of-lonely-childhood-in-emotional-desert-island-discs\">Tom Hanks speaks of lonely childhood in emotional Desert Island Discs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since then ... well, they have kept making strong films with major directors: Steven Spielberg is one frequent patron of the Tom Tom Club, and Clint Eastwood directs Hanks in the forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/03/sully-review-clint-eastwood-and-tom-hanks-turn-a-mile-high-miracle-into-middling-drama\">Sully</a>. But there is a reason that the Oscar nominations have dried up. When the Toms hit middle age in the 21st century, they didn\u2019t take the opportunity to experiment with quirky character roles, but concentrated instead on projects that would fit their golden-boy personas and bolster their brands. Perhaps Cruise wanted to repair his public image after a run of scandals involving Scientology, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQgXEkL3NV4\">sofa-jumping</a>, and ill-informed comments on psychiatry and antidepressant medicine. Perhaps Hanks wanted to maintain his reputation as the World\u2019s Nicest Celebrity \u2013 a reputation burnished last month<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/sep/28/tom-hanks-crashes-wedding-photoshoot-in-central-park-video\"> when he interrupted his Central Park jog in order to join in the wedding of a couple he had never met</a>. Whatever the Toms were thinking, Hanks doesn\u2019t play doomed gangsters (Road to Perdition) or Wall Street cheats (The Bonfire of the Vanities) any more, and Cruise no longer plays radicalised war veterans (Born on the Fourth of July) or husbands forced to question their masculinity (Eyes Wide Shut). There is no more risky business from either of them.</p> <p>If you browse through the last decade of the Toms\u2019 filmographies, you\u2019re struck by how tightly they control the type of characters they play. Hanks\u2019 latest work includes The Terminal, three Dan Browns, Larry Crowne, Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close, Saving Mr Banks, Bridge of Spies, A Hologram for the King, and Sully. Cruise\u2019s includes The Last Samurai, War of the Worlds, various Mission: Impossibles, Valkyrie, Knight and Day, two Lee Childs, Oblivion, and Edge of Tomorrow. Anyone on a deadline to design a poster for any of these Cruise films could go for a closeup of TC gritting his teeth, plus some blurring to suggest that he was moving at high speed; for a Hanks film, they could use a shot of TH standing in the middle distance, wearing a suit, holding a briefcase and looking worried. They wouldn\u2019t go far wrong.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/sep/28/tom-hanks-crashes-wedding-photoshoot-in-central-park-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/55xmj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2756962\"            data-video-name=\"Tom Hanks crashes wedding photoshoot in Central Park \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57eb4d73e4b04cbd30bc3d0d\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/28/160928hanxwedding_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/28/160928hanxwedding.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/28/160928hanxwedding_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/sep/28/tom-hanks-crashes-wedding-photoshoot-in-central-park-video\">Tom Hanks crashes wedding photoshoot in Central Park</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Nearly every recent-ish film starring either of them is efficient, middlebrow, expensive-looking, politically unchallenging entertainment. It isn\u2019t surreal or subtitled, it doesn\u2019t have much gore or swearing or nudity (Cruise\u2019s shirtless scenes aside), it isn\u2019t either depressing or wildly funny. Hanks\u2019 films are almost all dramas, Cruise\u2019s are almost all thrillers. Hanks always plays a fast-talking, charming, yet somewhat isolated fellow who strives to do the right thing. Cruise plays an essentially sexless, authority-defying, athletic loner who overcomes his initial egotism or fecklessness to vanquish the forces of evil. His characters always look and sound exactly like Tom Cruise, too, whether it\u2019s the German colonel in Valkyrie who has an American accent, or the blond giant from Lee Child\u2019s Jack Reacher books, they\u2019re all a brown-haired not-giant on screen.</p> <p>It\u2019s also unusual for a Tom Tom Club film to have an all-star ensemble cast, a la Ocean\u2019s Eleven. In 1994\u2019s Interview With a Vampire, Cruise shared the screen with such fellow hunks as Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas and Christian Slater, but he soon decided that a Tom Cruise film had to be about Tom Cruise, a decision to which Brian De Palma alludes ruefully in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/25/de-palma-documentary-review\">the new documentary about him, De Palma</a>. Discussing 1996\u2019s Mission: Impossible, the first film that Cruise co-produced, the director says: \u201cThe TV show was about a team, but now it\u2019s a Tom Cruise movie. The first thing you gotta do is kill off the whole team.\u201d And that\u2019s what De Palma and his screenwriters did. Kristin Scott Thomas and Emilio Estevez were dispatched in the opening act, and the team element wasn\u2019t reintroduced until much later in the series.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4eb8426e9bf334a9b8cbe6b95142ccc4a79d307\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4eb8426e9bf334a9b8cbe6b95142ccc4a79d307/0_82_2264_1358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Cruise with Emmanuelle Beart in the first Mission: Impossible.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Cruise with Emmanuelle Beart in the first Mission: Impossible.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clearly, the Toms\u2019 consistency has paid off. Their vast wealth flows from their unmatched genius for dependability, so it might seem absurd to ask them to try something different. But if you compare them with the more adventurous superstars of their own vintage (Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, George Clooney), not to mention the indie-friendly Goslings and Gyllenhaals of the next generation, this lack of variety starts to seem like a cowardly waste of their talents.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/27/tom-cruise-scientology-is-a-beautiful-religion\">Tom Cruise: Scientology is 'a beautiful religion'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s not as if the Toms aren\u2019t capable of surprising performances in stimulating films. Cruise showed that he could be sinister in Collateral and funny in Tropic Thunder. Hanks demonstrated his range with his multiple roles in Cloud Atlas, and, especially, in the post-trauma medical-examination scenes in Captain Phillips and Sully. But these glimpses of greatness remain the exceptions to the rule. We\u2019re still waiting for a film to plumb the depths beneath Hanks\u2019 likability and Cruise\u2019s singleminded focus.</p> <p>I would have paid good money to see either of them as the Joker in The Dark Knight or Calvin Candie in Django Unchained or Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood. (Paul Thomas Anderson directed Cruise in Magnolia, so it\u2019s not a ridiculous idea.) And let\u2019s not forget that Christian Bale\u2019s interpretation of Patrick Bateman in American Psycho was inspired by seeing Cruise being interviewed by David Letterman, and noting his \u201cintense friendliness with nothing behind the eyes\u201d. How enthralling would it have been if the film-makers had cut out the middle-man and cast Cruise as Bateman instead? Or what about Hanks as the axe-murdering Phil Collins fan? That, admittedly, might have been a stretch, but it would have been more interesting than Inferno or Jack Reacher: Never Go Back.</p>",

  "<p>Wearily nearing the end of the current round of supermarket tastings, I\u2019m struck by two things: how little innovation there is (I\u2019ve been seeing the same old wines for years); and how inflated the regular price of some of the bottles now are. The former probably matters less to you than to me \u2013 we hacks are always after something new, whereas you\u2019re probably devoutly relieved that a wine you like is still available.

I can\u2019t tell you at the time of writing who has a deal on \u2013 the supermarkets tend to announce promotions at the last minute, so as not to lose competitive advantage \u2013 but if your wine rack needs topping, do check if anyone has one on.</p> <p>An independent wine shop, on the other hand, will generally offer you better value for money, as well as expert advice on the sort of wine that should appeal to you.

  "<p>In June 2007, the Guardian critic Michael Billington was asked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2007/jun/15/whoisbritainsbesttheatred\" title=\"\">to name the best theatre director</a> in the UK. In selecting Howard Davies, who has died aged 71, over some of his better-known colleagues, Billington was confirming the profession\u2019s worst-kept secret. Not only was Howard the master of 20th-century repertory, the supreme interpreter of Gorky, O\u2019Casey, O\u2019Neill, Albee, Miller and Williams. He was also one of the first names most playwrights would think of when asked whom we would like to direct our next play.</p> <p>It was Howard\u2019s fate only once to run a theatre of his own. For most of his life, he acted as a vital lieutenant, first to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/apr/16/val-may\" title=\"\">Val May</a> at the Bristol Old Vic, then to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/trevor-nunn\" title=\"\">Trevor Nunn</a> at the Royal Shakespeare Company, and finally to successive directors at the National Theatre: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/peter-hall\" title=\"\">Peter Hall</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/richardeyre\" title=\"\">Richard Eyre</a>, Nunn and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/nicholas-hytner\" title=\"\">Nick Hytner</a>. All four artistic directors relied on him equally and turned to him first, occasionally in panic, when needing a guaranteed return to quality. It was Hytner who best summed up the professionalism and consistency of his work by referring to him as the \u201cirreplaceable cornerstone\u201d of his years at the National Theatre. \u201cIf only I had three Howard Davieses, running this place would be simplicity itself.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/oct/27/howard-davies-theatre-director-obituary-dead-tribute\">Howard Davies: a lightning rod for theatrical genius</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Born in Reading, the son of Thomas, a miner turned glassblower who instilled in him a deep love of learning, and his wife, Hilda, Howard was propelled by scholarship to Christ\u2019s Hospital, Horsham, where the teachers were bright enough to give a natural rebel a measure of authority which he immediately used to abolish fagging. The experience of being forced through the class and educational system bred in him a peppery radicalism which was evident both at Durham University and in Bristol, where he first worked at the Old Vic in the early 1970s, while living in a commune. It was there that he met his first wife, Sue Wall, with whom he had two adored daughters, Kate and Hannah.</p> <p>From the start, the twin hallmarks of Howard\u2019s work were evident. His early grounding in Brecht left him with a lifelong determination to dig out and make evident on stage the social and political context of the play he was directing. No Davies production was ever pitched in a void of pure style.

But a period of living in New York left him doubtful whether he wanted to work in the commercial theatre. His love was for ensemble, and for deeply wrought work. Any compromise with theatre-for-money enraged him. Stubborn and plain-spoken, he never envied the emollience necessary to shove half-baked stars into the starting gate.</p> <p>Instead, at the National, with the help of the designers Crowley, <a href=\"http://www.bunnychristie.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Bunny Christie</a> and Vicki Mortimer, he continued to develop a unique language, a supple kind of deep-breathing spacious naturalism, particularly in the Lyttelton, which was his and his alone, and in which every single role was given its democratic focus. This method filled out Russian plays such as Bulgakov\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/mar/24/the-white-guard-review\" title=\"\">The White Guard</a> and Gorky\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/may/31/theatre5\" title=\"\">Philistines</a> as richly as it did Irish plays such as Boucicault\u2019s The Shaughran. By the time he took on Sean O\u2019Casey\u2019s notoriously difficult <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/24/the-silver-tassie-review-national-theatre\" title=\"\">The Silver Tassie</a> in 2014, his control was so perfect that he could pull into one flow scenes that are usually too wildly disparate to hold together.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/zoe-wanamaker\" title=\"\">Zo\u00eb Wanamaker</a> once remarked that there are many directors who can tell actors whether what you are doing is good or bad. But she had known only three who could help you when you were in trouble. Top of her list was Howard. I saw for myself the beauty of his rapport with actors for the first time when he directed my play The Secret Rapture in 1988. \u201cOh by the way,\u201d he announced one day, \u201cI\u2019ve given the play a new ending.\u201d When I nervously asked what it was, he said \u201cWait and see.\u201d I did, and it was better than the one I\u2019d written. We were to work together six times on film and on stage \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/maggie-smith\" title=\"\">Maggie Smith</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/judi-dench\" title=\"\">Judi Dench</a> played in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2002/oct/16/theatre.artsfeatures3\" title=\"\">The Breath of Life</a> (2002) at the Haymarket, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tamsin-greig\" title=\"\">Tamsin Greig</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/nicola-walker\" title=\"\">Nicola Walker</a> played in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/nov/12/theatre1\" title=\"\">Gethsemane</a> (2008) at the Cottesloe \u2013 and each time I wondered at the total contrast between the person outside the rehearsal room, who might well arrive combative, antsy or discontent, with the serenity and focus of the maestro who directed inside it. You could feel the change as he passed through the door.</p> <p>He always had a passion for walking, and he deliberately spaced out his trips abroad to work off some of the excess energy created by the concentration of directing. When I joked that his autobiography should be entitled Doing a Runner, he grinned and said, \u201cToo right.\u201d Only by getting away frequently could he be so intensely present when he was needed. He also lavished love on his three grandchildren, Sam, Iris and Ida. When, some years after his first marriage had ended in divorce, he met Clare Holman, they took to travelling together all over the world, and were married in 2005 at Coombe Valley in Devon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53bb0a34702c13f36c586e78e2987fba87d8ff88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53bb0a34702c13f36c586e78e2987fba87d8ff88/211_494_1408_844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maggie Smith, foreground, and Judi Dench in The Breath of Life, directed by Howard Davies at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, London, in 2002.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maggie Smith, foreground, and Judi Dench in The Breath of Life, directed by Howard Davies at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, London, in 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His later work became more various.

But a running thread throughout was his feel for the writing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/howardbrenton\" title=\"\">Howard Brenton</a>. He and Hytner persuaded Brenton back into the theatre after a stay in television with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/nov/10/theatre\" title=\"\">drama about St Paul</a>.

The last time I went to see him, two weeks ago, he and Clare had laid out a feast of wine and food, which he could not manage, but which typically he said \u201cI will hugely enjoy watching you eat\u201d. That night, there was the usual generous love of good times and good talk, which rolled into his character as an artist. His stage had breadth, daring, light and, above all, movement. In a Howard Davies production you couldn\u2019t disentangle interpretation from narrative or character. They were one. It\u2019s rare that anyone\u2019s whole.

  "<p>The mortality of love and the terrible cost of parting are at the centre of this intimately painful breakup drama from director and co-writer Joachim Lafosse, who made the comparably difficult <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/09/our-children-review\">Our Children</a> in 2013.

They have two girls that they adore, and this love is what makes their own falling out of love so agonising. They are not married, which means that splitting assets is even more of an acrimonious minefield than it might otherwise be. They are still living together in the family home, having long since decided their relationship is over. Now this apartment is a war zone. But there are very few theatrics, and the shouting isn\u2019t what makes their situation a nightmare.

He has done a lot of renovation work on their jointly owned apartment which has considerably increased its value, but his business is in a terrible way and it is Marie who has had to pay the bills. She is a little higher up the social scale than Boris, and it was only a cash gift from her well-off mother that allowed them to get the mortgage. Boris has furthermore got mixed up with some scary, tough characters who loaned him cash, or who have perhaps not been paid for work or materials. Clearly, Boris\u2019s pride will not allow him to admit he is in over his head with these guys, and this same pride is what causes him to resent Marie\u2019s breadwinner status. His childish, petulant taunts at her for being rich cause Marie to withdraw even further into icy anger. She admits that everything Boris does disgusts her: even the way he stands.</p> <p>Actor and director Kahn, who seems now often to be cast as the grizzled, embittered ex-husband, is very good at showing how petty little mind games are the only thing that allows him to assert his wounded masculinity: silly squabbles over eating cheese from outside his designated part of the fridge; semi-deliberately forgetting the times and dates they agreed on for his access to the kids; making an unforgivable scene at a dinner party Marie holds for her friends.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/11/berenice-bejo-interview-childhood-of-a-leader\">B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo: \u2018We cannot live with fear in our bodies\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bejo has the elegant, severe beauty of someone who accepts the martyred responsibility of having to be the grownup, and who can therefore sometimes be too high-handed. Most excruciating of all are the moments when Boris and Marie remember why they once loved each other \u2013 and desired each other.</p> <p>The most horribly fascinating scene is their \u201csummit\u201d discussion about how to divvy up their assets: he wants half, she thinks he\u2019s entitled to just a third. Marie points out that it was her mother\u2019s money which made buying the flat possible; far from conceding the point, Boris merely derides her princessy unearned cash. This relationship has turned into a class war of capital and labour.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-zxQXzSpbM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I-zxQXzSpbM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-zxQXzSpbM\">Watch the trailer for After Love on YouTube</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>How has it come to this? How did love turn into such an ugly mess? And here is the most desolate question of all: is money the symptom or the cause? If they had no money worries, would they stay together in placid, irritable semi-harmony? Is there a level of financial difficulty which, once passed, makes married love impossible? Or is Marie\u2019s mother Christine (Marthe Keller) right when she says that we are not meant to love just one person for our whole lives, and that maturity means facing up to a new reality of companionship and friendship?</p> <p>What a very autumnal movie After Love is. Bejo and Kahn are excellent, although it is worth remembering how Bejo can also play in beguiling comedies such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/22/the-artist-film-review\">The Artist</a>, not just these austere, sombre marital dramas. As for Kahn, his directorial work shouldn\u2019t be forgotten. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/jun/07/1\">Roberto Succo</a> (2001) is one of the best French movies of the new century. After Love is intelligent, compassionate, challenging film-making.</p>",
  "<p><strong>What is it?</strong> The patch you strap on if your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/mad-men-tv-series\">Mad Men</a> withdrawal shakes won\u2019t quit.</p> <p><strong>Why you\u2019ll love it:</strong> (Or not) You won\u2019t find a single review of Good Girls Revolt that doesn\u2019t mention Mad Men and this one will be no different. I have never seen a show so desperate to be Mad Men, with everything from the office set to the selection of character types to the slightly cringe whig-out scenes and hippy happenings bearing a remarkable resemblance to AMC\u2019s biggest hit. This show feels like a determined but naive girl, trying to wear her big sister\u2019s heels but walking ever so slightly like a duck in them.</p> <p>Mad Men bowed out at the end of the 60s and this show also chooses to use the transition from the 1969\u201370 as the background to the zeitgeisty lives of the employees at a busy New York media office. This time it\u2019s fictional magazine News of the Week, but the office politics, booze consumption and clacking typewriters have been shipped wholesale.</p> <p>It\u2019s based on <a href=\"http://www.lynnpovich.com/_i_the_good_girls_revolt_how_the_women_of_newsweek_sued_their_bosses_and_changed_111485.htm\">Lynn Povich\u2019s well-documented real experience</a> of helping to lead a female staff mutiny at Newsweek in the 1970s, one which resulted in 46 workers suing their employer for discrimination. But back at News of the Week, it\u2019s the 70s, guys, and there\u2019s a whole lot of news happening out there, goddammit. While the all-male editorial team of said journal are busy taking the credit, they fail to notice that their female researchers are secretly banding together to demand a crack at the reporting jobs.</p> <p>A big story needs big characters and this is told from the viewpoint of three main fictional researchers (although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/27/nora-ephron\">Nora Ephron</a> is thrown in there too for authenticity) on a publication that doesn\u2019t appreciate them. There\u2019s feisty shit-stirrer Patti (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GenevieveAngel?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Genevieve Angelson</a>) who gets dumped by her boyfriend for being too much of a feminist blow-hard. Then we meet Cindy (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3520615/\">Erin Darke</a>), forever pushing her oval glasses on to her nose demurely and pretending to be less clever than she is. They are joined by Jane (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2319871/\">Anna Camp</a>), who starts the show fixated on marriage and how big she can backcomb her hair, but finds there is more to life than a Tiffany ring. You get the picture.</p> <p>Lording it over them is Finn (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0224565/\">Chris Diamantopoulos</a>), the Don Draper of News of the Week, married to his job, an irascible husband who goes all adorable when playing with kids and then hurls a typewriter through a glass partition because he\u2019s so complicated. And Cindy is Peggy Olson. And Jane is Betty Draper. It\u2019s The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2013/jun/30/rolling-stones-bootleg-beatles-glastonbury\">Bootleg Beatles</a>, genuinely, but I still can\u2019t bring myself to hate it. Either I\u2019m missing Mad Men so much I\u2019ll take a lookalike and just squint to enjoy it, or it actually isn\u2019t bad and I need to try to see past the many similarities between the two.</p> <p>Cindy is the hook that keeps me watching as she transforms from trapped, subservient housewife into someone with a growing curiosity for what she might actually like if given a free choice. And the answer is autonomy and unlimited clitoral orgasms.</p> <p>Good Girls Revolt tells an important story and it reminds us, implicitly, that this war isn\u2019t over. We are not watching the past, yet.</p> <p><strong>Length:</strong> eight one-hour episodes, all available now on Amazon Prime.</p> <p><strong>Stand-out episode:</strong> episode five, in which my favourite character, Cindy, begins her own personal revolt against her dull marriage. So much polo neck sex.</p> <p><strong>If you liked Good Girls Revolt, watch:</strong> I\u2019m trying not to type Mad Men (Amazon Prime) but I\u2019m going to have to say Mad Men.

  "<p>In 2013, I contracted a virus that I thought was the flu. It ended up being <a href=\"http://www.legalnomads.com/dengue-sucks-donkey-balls/\">dengue</a>, sometimes referred to as \u201cbreakbone fever\u201d. The nickname is a reference to the levels of pain some people experience when they are in dengue\u2019s throes. I expected my symptoms to subside once the active infection went away. After all, friends who contracted dengue, sometimes multiple years in a row, seemed to return to a sense of normalcy. Instead, the joint pain remained, below the fever pitch of \u201cbreaking bones\u201d but nowhere near my old self. For a long time I waited for that \u201cold self\u201d to materialize, and for the pain to recede. It took three years to finally surrender to my present and admit that the pain wasn\u2019t going anywhere.</p> <h2>Pain, fatigue and my new normal</h2> <p>\u201cPain is a message to the mind that something is wrong,\u201d Anna Altman wrote in <a href=\"https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/every-body-goes-haywire/\">a devastating piece</a> about managing her own pain and migraines. \u201cTo this day I guard a hidden hope that I will receive a new diagnosis, one that clearly explains the severity of my symptoms.\u201d</p> <p>Like Anna, I don\u2019t have a definitive answer about what to call the aggregate of pain that has taken up residence. However, I do have an idea of how it got there.</p> <p>The scene of the \u201ccrime\u201d: Saigon, where I got dengue fever.</p> <p>I got dengue in Vietnam, while already having celiac disease. It hung out, and wreaked further havoc on my immune system. Doctors have offered up that the dengue triggered post-viral fatigue, which may or may not go away. It also gifted me with <a href=\"http://www.raynauds.org/\">Raynaud\u2019s</a> disease, a disorder of the small blood vessels that reduces blood flow. </p> <p>When exposed to cold, my blood vessels go into spasms, which causes pain, numbness, aching and tingling. When I touch cold food or I am in cold weather, my hands and feet turn white, then blue. I tried making meatballs this summer, but had to stop because touching the ground meat was so painful that I stood in the kitchen in tears. </p> <p>To add to the list, I seem to have lost my fingerprints. I found this out when applying for a visa. After placing my hands on the digital fingerprint reader, all of my fingers had giant red Xs on them. \u201cOh!\u201d said the man reading the scans. \u201cYou have no fingerprints!\u201d <em>Excuse me?</em> I found <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1820184/\">a 1970 study</a> noting that some celiacs have fingerprint atrophy, but mine were definitely intact pre-dengue. A mystery. Jokes about my going out and robbing banks abound, don\u2019t worry.</p> <p>And finally, the most debilitating thing after the joint pain itself has been the fatigue. A deep, never-ending bone weariness that makes simple things seem like obstacles. And a restless sleep that does not provide respite from the haze of exhaustion.</p> <p>The combination of chronic pain, circulation issues and fatigue combined to compress my resilience and made it difficult to see the forest through the trees. Emotionally, it felt like small disagreements loomed large. I found myself more reactive than before, taking things more personally.</p> <p>Instead of facing my days with resolve, I started curling into myself, warding off intrusions that might make things hurt more. I started fearing the next shoe that could drop, and wondering if I would be able to cope. Anxiety can be magnificently destructive, but when combined with chronic pain it becomes paralyzing. Worrying about whether you can withstand more pain is a valid concern. But as I eventually figured out, it only serves to make things worse.</p> <p>In his book <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2evQ16l\">Full Catastrophe Living</a>, Jon Kabat-Zinn notes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you have a chronic illness or a disability that prevents you from doing what you used to be able to do, whole areas of control may go up in smoke. And if your condition causes you physical pain that has not responded well to medical treatment, the distress you might be feeling can be compounded by emotional turmoil caused by knowing that your condition seems to be beyond even your doctor\u2019s control.</p> </blockquote> <p>My distress was compounded by the fact that I looked healthy, even though I was in pain all of the time. \u201cYou seem great!\u201d friends would say, glimpsing a photo on Facebook. Some would tell me to take supplements, or to just \u201cthink positive\u201d about the pain and live my life as I used to. They meant well, of course. But the comments reveal a dismissiveness about longer-term pain that other friends with \u201cinvisible illnesses\u201d struggle with also. It\u2019s as if people expected us to will it away. If only we had thought about being more positive! How silly of us.</p> <p><a href=\"https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/\">The Spoon Theory</a> explains the effects of invisible pain with very effective imagery. You only have a certain amount of \u201cspoons\u201d in a day, and you use them to do things that most people don\u2019t think twice about. Because for you, being in constant pain, even simple things require spoons. So everything you do, every decision you make about undertaking activities, it comes with the knowledge that there\u2019s a spoon-like opportunity cost. And if you use up all your spoons that day, that\u2019s it. You can\u2019t do anything but rest, since you are so depleted.</p> <p>The problem is that for most people, pain is temporary. When it becomes a full-time roommate, the things that used to help \u2013 going to the gym to work through it, climbing a mountain and communing with nature, going to a concert \u2013 become threats instead of pleasurable experiences. And for many, that kind of sustained bracing is beyond contemplation.</p> <p>No matter the challenges in my life, be it someone who bet me I <a href=\"http://www.legalnomads.com/why-i-quit-my-job-to-travel-around-the-world/\">couldn\u2019t get into law school </a>or the other <a href=\"http://www.legalnomads.com/three-years-of-sickness-and-travel-by-the-numbers/\">illnesses on my travels</a>, I have always found a way around. This time felt different, because the pain was ongoing and frustratingly opaque.</p> <p>The Portuguese have a word I love, <em>saudade</em>. NPR <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/altlatino/2014/02/28/282552613/saudade-an-untranslatable-undeniably-potent-word\">defines it as follows</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>A melancholy nostalgia for something that perhaps has not even happened. It often carries an assurance that this thing you feel nostalgic for will never happen again.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8beab1b8d6dae12e23d619d0b50b1f36099402dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8beab1b8d6dae12e23d619d0b50b1f36099402dc/93_0_807_833/484.jpg\" alt=\"Saudade definition, drawn by hand by Ella Frances Sanders.\" width=\"484\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saudade definition, drawn by hand by <a href=\"https://ellafrancessanders.store/\">Ella Frances Sanders</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Ella Frances Sanders</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This word, untranslatable in English, is what I have struggled against these last years. A wistful longing for something that may never return. After so long, seeking an answer to \u201cfix\u201d the pain was not helping. I only turned toward healing once I forced that deep, destructive nostalgia out of my mind.</p> <h2>Turning things around</h2> <p>In her <a href=\"https://blog.longreads.com/2016/09/14/stat/\">long, thoughtful piece</a> about her daughter Carmen\u2019s MS journey, Maria Bustillos interviewed a doctor named George Jelinek. Dr Jelinek referred to the difference between \u201chealing\u201d and \u201ccuring\u201d, with the central message that it really matters to take a more active role in the care of our own bodies. Ultimately, if you fall through the cracks of the medical system, or if you fail to receive a diagnosis that has clear, actionable treatment, you have to take some control back for your own sense of self and health.</p> <p>Maria\u2019s reaction to his philosophy was one of comfort:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Being encouraged to take care of herself made a world of difference to Carmen, and to us. We weren\u2019t waiting around for the next bad thing to happen; we were working together in a diligent and increasingly hopeful state of mind.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the absence of finding a solution to stop <em>feeling</em> pain, I found hope in being able to reframe my attitude <em>toward</em> the pain. This included actively cultivating a sense of self-compassion, acceptance and gratitude. These are all words that pre-travel Jodi would have taken a look at and rolled her eyes forever.</p> <p>Simply accepting what is unmanageable and not trying to control what you cannot change is a marked shift from my old way of thinking. It is also directly in conflict with the way I was raised in western society. \u201cGive up and just accept that things suck? Are you <em>kidding</em>?\u201d But it is the only way that I have been able to turn things around. By focusing on my progress (or lack thereof), I was making a difficult situation more untenable. Now, I celebrate the small steps I have started to take instead of fighting for bigger goals.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/12/when-pain-persists-what-makes-hospital-patients-really-unhappy\">When pain persists: what makes hospital patients really unhappy? | Ranjana Srivastava</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rachel, a reader of mine who contracted dengue and malaria at the same time, has struggled with issues of chronic pain and fatigue. Her journey mirrored mine, except that she was able to see a pain specialist in her home country. She and I have gone back and forth about our experiences, and our respective attempts to find joy in a life that is now different for each of us. For her, too, it has meant accepting the pain and not struggling against it. She has also actively sought out what brings her joy. \u201cI had to try and look for joy and gratitude even when I didn\u2019t feel it,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis became reflexive, and somewhat automatic.\u201d</p> <p>Like me, Rachel wasn\u2019t brought up to seek out gratitude moment to moment. But she too found that focusing on it, even if things hurt, helped shape the outline of her healing.</p> <h2>How I learned to cope with chronic pain</h2> <p>The most important, most difficult, most fundamentally frustrating thing is this: you simply need to accept that this is your reality, and move forward from there. Even when moving forward feels like crawling on the floor, a millimeter at a time. Even when progress feels elusive, and you can\u2019t bend your hands in the morning. The only thing you can do is care for yourself and try to find solutions that work for the body you\u2019ve been given.</p> <p>I do want to add that I have experimented with a lot of different diet-based changes, supplements and therapies. I have been tested for inflammation markers in the blood (thankfully they\u2019re low), and thyroid disorders, and many other things. While I appreciate those telling me that I should try x and y thing that will magically fix it, with all due respect, I have tried many of those things.</p> <p>The pain is here, and it may be here to stay. All I can do is carve out my own joy within it, and accept that it is now a part of who I am.</p> <p><strong>1. Daily meditation</strong>: I meditate both morning and night, and while there are times where I feel resistant to the practice, I cannot deny that it makes a big difference. Meditation has helped <a href=\"http://www.legalnomads.com/vipassana-meditation/\">accepting what my body is feeling moment to moment</a>, and also reduced reactivity in other areas of my life.</p> <p>2. <strong>Read.</strong> I read three very helpful books for stress and pain management. The following books are three of the dozens and dozens that I have read in the realm of pain management, stress, self-help and more. They are books that I will return to, because they tackle the precise tool that has helped turn things around: my attitude toward the pain. I highly recommend all three, and each of them were suggestions from close friends who found them comforting. I\u2019ll be posting book summaries of these soon also.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2evPCAS\">Full Catastrophe Living</a>, by Jon Kabat-Zinn. As the creator of mindfulness-based stress reduction programmes, Zinn focuses on mind-body strategies derived from meditation and yoga to counteract stress, establish greater balance of body and mind, and help you get out of the rut of fearing pain.</li> <li><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2dN108Y\">Self-Compassion</a>, by Kristin Neff. Self-esteem work isn\u2019t the fix to perfectionism, argues Neff. Accepting the present, being kind and compassionate to ourselves and still striving to do better is. The book offers exercises and questions in each chapter to help.</li> <li><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2evOTQj\">When Things Fall Apart</a>, by Pema Chodron. I picked this book up a few years ago, but wasn\u2019t really ready to read it. Or rather, I was not yet willing to accept the pain and change my perspective about it. I was still looking for a fix. Chodron writes that when we are continually overcome by fear, anxiety and pain, the way out is to stop bracing against it and learning to stay open. Not easy, and you have to be willing to read her words without judgment, but I\u2019ve found them very helpful.</li> </ul> <p>3.<strong> I started to understand that resilience is a process</strong>. Like many overachievers, I trafficked in perfectionism for most of my life. I\u2019ve had to let that go. Warding off imperfection doesn\u2019t make us stronger, even if it feels like it might protect us. As with opening your heart to others, cultivating openness makes you resilient, not weaker. For chronic pain, baby steps feel like giant leaps. Progress doesn\u2019t happen overnight.</p> <p>4.<strong> Accepting what is</strong>. One of my best friends often mentions \u201cmagical thinking\u201d, that wishful place when you \u201cwhat if\u201d something to oblivion. Magical thinking isn\u2019t reality, it\u2019s simply a story you are telling yourself. Instead of my fantasy that I\u2019d wake up healthy one day, I\u2019ve worked on accepting what is. I\u2019m a person with significant pain problems, and I\u2019m availing myself of tools to cope better. It is what it is. All you can do is work with the reality you are living, and for me that meant accepting that these limits are valid and I need to respect them.</p> <p>5.<strong> Practicing gratitude</strong>. A friend argued that my <a href=\"http://www.legalnomads.com/\">blog</a> is a practice of gratitude, since it shares the many wonderful things I\u2019ve encountered and appreciated during my travels. While that\u2019s true, it also hasn\u2019t been enough to help me in this journey with pain. What has helped is very simple: writing down three things at the end of each day that I am grateful for, within my reality. There is <a href=\"http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/expandinggratitude\">science behind this practice</a>, despite my initial skepticism. Nowadays I\u2019m all for reminding myself of the good in my life, which is plentiful despite the pain.</p> <p>6.<strong> Implement movement wherever you can.</strong> Walking when the pain is slightly better, doing restorative yoga classes (highly recommended and far more gentle than a different type of yoga class), stretching and taking stairs when they are around. Every little bit of movement counts. I\u2019m used to it hurting when I move but I still try to move when I can.</p> <p>7. <strong>Trying to find joy in this new space</strong>. As I mentioned above, the things that brought me joy were the ones that now hurt. I had to get creative with the things that <em>were </em>available. I started to make lists, with a hat tip to the app <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/\">IFTTT</a> \u2013 if this, then that. I made two-column sheets: if this isn\u2019t available then I\u2019ll do that instead. If I can\u2019t climb a mountain, I can go for a long walk in the park. If I can\u2019t eat chillies, I can cook a fun meal at home. And so on.</p> <p>8. <strong>Morning and evening routines</strong>. These are <em>very</em> simple routines \u2013 not the \u201chow I hacked my mornings and became The Most Productive Entrepreneur Ever\u201d lists. I have found that even if it is a really painful day and I feel like it was a wash, I still feel like I accomplished something if I stick to them.</p> <p>9. <strong>Diet changes.</strong> Some of what has worked for me:</p> <ul> <li>This may be common sense to the rest of humanity, but I\u2019ve spent most of my life in a state of normalized dehydration. It\u2019s amazing how much better I feel when I drink water. It\u2019s as though everyone else telling me I was crazy for not drinking more of it was right.</li> <li>Cutting out caffeine except for that one (glorious) cup of coffee per day.</li> <li>Cutting out alcohol, with rare exceptions.</li> <li>Cutting down on sugar as much as possible. It\u2019s in a lot of foods, and I do put a spoon in my coffee, but I have eliminated desserts and snacks that have sugar.</li> <li>Taking a robust probiotic daily.</li> <li>I am already celiac, so I don\u2019t eat gluten but I have found when I do nowadays by mistake it\u2019s far worse than it was pre-dengue. So I\u2019m extra careful about cross-contamination. When my joints are particularly bad, I also cut out corn and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanaceae\">nightshades</a>.</li> </ul> <p>10.<strong> Connect with others.</strong> Chronic pain has a tendency to make you feel alone and misunderstood. While it\u2019s true that some people may not grasp the extent of it, no doubt if they are true friends they will love you all the same. Connecting to friends who accept me despite the current limitations has been really important in helping me out of my foggy isolation. I also appreciate friends and the three readers named Rachel who have been willing to share their experiences with chronic pain and immune disorders. As humans, we are wired for connecting to others and it\u2019s times like these that we need to remind ourselves to do so.</p>",

You have got to really want something to buy,\u201d said Suzanne Harlow, the group\u2019s trading director, who has been running the business since former chief executive Michael Sharp stepped down this spring. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s just about the weather,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Apart from expanding its homeware ranges, Debenhams is adapting to the changing market by improving its beauty halls with new, exclusive brands such as Kat Von D and putting in new eateries such as Patisserie Valerie and Costa Coffee.

  "<h2>THE SOUND OF INEVITABILITY</h2> <p>Wicked bigots, a number of whom have recently been trying to seize control of England, are in an advanced state of confusion today as they try to make sense of what they saw during Wednesday night\u2019s West Ham v Chelsea joust in the Coca-Cola Cup. Footage and photographs across a variety of media outlets clearly show rows of valiant individuals trying to stop hordes of mostly white savages <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/27/fa-west-ham-chelsea-crowd-trouble-investigation\">from tearing into each other</a> and spilling rivers of blood in the stands in the name of some ancient tribal feud.

Of course, the fact that around 10,000 tickets went unsold for the game suggests that many people foresaw the outbreak of violent stupidity, having picked up the clues from West Ham\u2019s previous attempts to safeguard supporters at their spacious new home. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/05/west-ham-karren-brady-stadium-move\">That new brand</a> that Karren Brady said she and her highly respected employers want to give West Ham isn\u2019t looking too hot right now.

  "<p>Bear with me on this. I have to get through a little bit of recent history before I reach the point. I\u2019m going to risk the devil-in-the-detail clich\u00e9 because it is so apt.</p> <p>For the last couple of weeks, several newspapers have been getting into a lather about the possible triggering of section 40 of the crime and courts act.</p> <p>Editorial writers and columnists decried it as a threat to press freedom. It is, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2016/10/19/this-threat-to-press-freedom-should-be-abandoned/\">said the Daily Telegraph</a>, \u201ca pernicious measure that would see libel costs awarded against any newspaper which is not a member of a government-approved regulator\u201d.</p> <p>It would mean that even if a paper won a legal action, successfully defending itself against a claim, it would have to pay the claimant\u2019s costs.</p> <p>The Daily Mail called it <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3857836/DAILY-MAIL-COMMENT-Freedom-not-bend-blackmail.html\">\u201can appalling piece of legislation\u201d</a>. The Times argued that it sought \u201cto corral independent news organisations into a form of state-backed regulation <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/not-impressed-srf2bdrsj\">that is itself inimical to freedom of expression\u201d</a>. </p> <p>In company with most newspapers, it was sticking by the regulator set up by publishers, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), which has refused to seek official recognition under the royal charter created in the wake of the Leveson inquiry. </p> <p><em>I know this is tough going but please don\u2019t go. A hugely significant story will emerge.</em> </p> <p>On Tuesday, matters seemed to change. <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/government-backs-down-over-threat-to-press-freedom-bw2r3ckr5\">According to a front page news story in the Times </a> (and another<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2042988/government-signals-major-u-turn-in-its-war-on-press-freedom/\"> in the Sun</a>), the government was not, after all, contemplating the introduction of the feared section 40. Citing \u201cWestminster sources\u201d, the article stated that the provision \u201cwill not go ahead\u201d. </p> <p>It also reported, as did others, comments by the culture secretary Karen Bradley when giving evidence to the commons culture, media and sport select committee.</p> <p>She told MPs: \u201cI have had representations from local editors extremely concerned about section 40\u201d. And she also said: \u201cI have made no decision on the timing of a decision on section 40. I don\u2019t rule it out at some point in the future.\u201d </p> <p>The Times reported that its sources interpreted this statement to mean that she would not implement the clause. </p> <p>So it was a case of problem over then? Evidently not, because - <em>forgive me again</em> - I have to go back, to 11 October, and this time to the House of Lords.</p> <p>On that day, four peers - led by Baroness (Sheila) Hollins, a crossbencher - tabled amendments to the investigatory powers bill aimed at bringing in section 40 by a new route (pejoratively, the back door). It would have the effect of making newspapers pay costs for both parties in phone-hacking claims.</p> <p>Hollins\u2019s intention was <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2016-10-11/debates/5D79C3CE-D9FD-42D3-8061-A3D8A58C2145/InvestigatoryPowersBill\">explicit in her speech.</a> She said there had not been an explanation from the former culture secretary, John Whittingdale, about his refusal to introduce section 40.<br></p> <p>\u201cThat represents a change of government policy\u201d, she said, \u201cwhich both breaks the cross-party agreement and betrays promises made to both houses and to press abuse victims\u201d.</p> <p>The amendments<a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2016-10-11/division/04D54CE1-AAD2-4E9F-9C92-72D9EB5DAF1C/InvestigatoryPowersBill\"> were carried by 282 votes to 180</a> (thereby making history as the first government defeat since Theresa May became prime minister).</p> <p>Now the bill will have a formal third reading in the Lords on Monday (31 October) before being debated the following day in the Commons. </p> <p>It is therefore theoretically possible that section 40, or some version of it, could pass into law. It is uncertain whether the government will be able to whip all Tory MPs into line.</p> <p><em>Now, finally, here\u2019s the disturbing implication should the amendment be passed...</em></p> <p>Imagine this scenario. A person who makes a legal complaint about a story argues that the details could only have been obtained by a journalist hacking into his/her phone.</p> <p>The editor, inevitably, would seek to protect the reporter\u2019s source. In so doing, however, it would be impossible to prove whether hacking was or was not involved.</p> <p>In the ensuing legal action, under the section 40 provision, the newspaper\u2019s publisher would be liable for the costs of the claimant as well as its own. It could prove commercially disastrous for some publishers.<br></p> <p>It would affect all newspapers that are not regulated by an approved regulator, which means all those titles currently with Ipso (ie, the vast majority) plus the many outside (such as the Guardian, Financial Times, London Evening Standard and Private Eye). </p> <p>There\u2019s a second important point to note as well. From the moment it was first mooted that press regulation should be carried out under the auspices of a royal charter it was argued that it gave parliament too great an opportunity to restrict press freedom.</p> <p>It was argued that the terms of the charter could be tinkered with at some future stage. This was pooh-poohed at the time as being far-fetched. </p> <p>Now, with the inappropriate use of the investigatory powers bill to introduce section 40 by sleight of hand, it has come to pass. And it surely does threaten the freedom of the press.</p> <p>However much one sympathises with people who have suffered at the hands of the press, and however much I lack sympathy for newspapers guilty of all manner of bad behaviour, I cannot but see section 40 as a retrograde step.</p>",

In a statement released on Wednesday, the government reiterated its support for the tribunal.</p> <p>\u201cBotswana is convinced that as the only permanent international criminal tribunal, the ICC is an important unique institution in the international criminal justice system. Botswana therefore wishes to reaffirm its membership of the Rome statute and reiterate its support for a strong international criminal justice system through the ICC,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/botswana-reaffirms-support-for-icc-regrets-sa-decision-20161026\">the statement read</a>. </p> <p>Senegal has declined to take an official position, but its justice minister, Sidiki Kaba, who also happens to be the current president of the assembly of state parties to the Rome statute of the international criminal court, has urged South Africa and Burundi to reconsider their positions.</p> <p>So while it may be wounded, the ICC is not dead in Africa \u2013 not yet. The anti-ICC brigade is strong and growing, but it does not yet enjoy complete continent-wide support. <strong tabindex=\"-1\"><strong tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\"></strong></strong></p>",

  "<p>What is yoga? Sport, therapy, or is it a religion? If you\u2019re not a yoga insider and you heard the director of the <a href=\"http://www.bwy.org.uk/\" title=\"\">British Wheel of Yoga (BWY)</a> clash with a Hindu monastic over these questions <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07zxgmy\" title=\"\">on the BBC this week</a>, you\u2019d be none the wiser. Their prickly duet sang of a subculture-turned-industry that not only can\u2019t decide which of the three it is, but for decades has based its mystique on the tensions between them.</p> <p>The question prompting this debate is whether or not yoga is ripe for regulatory intervention through a <a href=\"http://nos.ukces.org.uk/Pages/index.aspx\" title=\"\">national occupational standard</a> for teachers. The BWY, which has instigated this idea, says yes because yoga is causing physical injury, although it can\u2019t say how much, and because some teacher training courses are too short \u2013 although they won\u2019t say which ones.

However, data on both the good and bad of yoga postures is thin, because yoga is hard to study. Researchers face huge definitional, methodological and conflict-of-interest obstacles to finding the answers that would-be regulators would require. Whose yoga is being tested is the first question, followed by <a href=\"https://www.yogauonline.com/yogau-wellness-blog/what-makes-good-yoga-study-some-basics\" title=\"\">what that yoga consists of</a>. Yoga tests are impossible to control or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_experiment\" title=\"\">double-blind</a>. And from the beginnings of modern yoga in 1930s India, researchers have been invested in positive outcomes. Many have been self-promoting teachers, propagandists, unwitting pseudoscientists, or a blend of the lot.</p> <p>I can understand Fox\u2019s warnings about injuries. When I started publishing on yoga, I too used to be outraged that people were getting hurt by yoga when they were looking for something that made them feel better. But I quickly realised my concern was about something deeper than the torn hamstrings and shoulder dislocations that could more easily happen at the gym or playing tennis. I learned that what little hard data we have shows that <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230624251\" title=\"\">injury rates in yoga are quite low</a>. And in more than 200 interviews with subjects injured doing yoga, I\u2019ve found that \u201cexpert\u201d teaching is as much a predictor of injury as a preventer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f14e5fff107a2448680a020667abe42370db8042\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f14e5fff107a2448680a020667abe42370db8042/0_0_4802_3642/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women practise yoga in class.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"758\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Seek out independent, low-key teachers who don\u2019t put on airs.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Why? Because those \u201cexperts\u201d who led yoga\u2019s globalisation in the 1970s had some downright medieval ideas about the human body. Renowned yoga practitioner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/20/bks-iyengar\" title=\"\">BKS Iyengar</a> suggested that placing the full weight of the body on to one\u2019s head in headstand was a great idea among other things. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/08/k-pattabhi-jois-obituary-yoga\" title=\"\">Pattabhi Jois</a> \u2013 Fox\u2019s own root-guru \u2013 named his joint-punishing Ashtanga Primary Series Therapy for the Body. Along with the echoes of their abusive childhoods, they <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/21443879/Seizing_the_Whip_B._K._S._Iyengar_and_the_Making_of_Modern_Yoga\" title=\"\">passed these axioms down</a> through harrowing training regimes in which devotion served as tuition.</p> <p>My research has led me to believe that if there are injuries to worry about, they\u2019re not primarily from particular postures or inadequate teacher training. They come from dysfunctional learning relationships in which the abusive attitudes and behaviours of top teachers are internalised by students. I\u2019d be less interested in the resum\u00e9s of ordinary British yoga teachers than in sussing out how to prevent personality cults which risk normalising questionable teaching methods. Think of Iyengar\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/22/my-teacher-bks-iyengar-yoga\" title=\"\"> habit of slapping students to correct their positions</a> .</p> <p>For her part, Swami Ambikananda Saraswati seems keen on a different kind of micromanagement: to protect the image of yoga from business-oriented interlopers. But when she claims that she stewards a 5,000-year-old tradition that\u2019s religious in nature, and Hindu in essence, and that regulating it would continue the barbarity of the British Raj, she stretches the ligaments of credulity. Her argument must surely make atheist, agnostic, Buddhist and Muslim yogis nervous, even as it neglects to note that regulatory oversight might have prevented some branches of yoga from falling into sociopathy cloaked by traditionalism.</p> <p>Regulating yoga teaching could even protect her own school. Her <a href=\"http://www.traditionalyoga.org/\" title=\"\">Traditional Yoga Association</a> claims its spiritual heritage through relationship to Swami Sivananda. Unfortunately, so does the Satyananda school of yoga, which has been <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-14/children-lived-in-fear-of-yoga-ashram-leader/7845164\" title=\"\">rocked by allegations in Australia</a> of historical child sexual abuse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/23/yoga-classes-cultural-appropriation\">Are yoga classes just bad cultural appropriation? | Nell Frizzell and Reni Eddo-Lodge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet, Swami Ambikananda is right to say the BWY\u2019s regulatory initiative is needless. Questions of physical safety in yoga classes are working themselves out through simple market pressures. Many teacher training courses now hire physiotherapists or osteopaths to teach anatomy and physiology, and the new buzzwords of yogaland are \u201cbiomechanics\u201d, \u201cfunctional movement\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"http://www.wildyoga.co.uk/2016/03/trauma-sensitive/\" title=\"\">trauma sensitivity</a>\u201d. Consensus is sure to develop around touchy issues like the safety of the headstand, heated studios or passive stretching. This will happen because people want it to happen, not because organisations like the BWY says it must.</p> <p>While it all shakes out, people who just want to feel the loveliness of yoga can remember a few simple pointers. If you move with the simplicity and curiosity of a small child, you\u2019re unlikely to hurt yourself. If a teacher seems to have an agenda for your body you don\u2019t understand or didn\u2019t consent to, they need to go to therapy.</p> <p>Yoga bureaucrats cannot guarantee yoga safety. Nor can yoga priests. But if you seek out independent, low-key teachers who don\u2019t put on airs and don\u2019t lay their trips on your body, you might feel they naturally offer something that neither regulation nor religion can guarantee: humility.</p>",
  "<p>The only real question about the chaotic closure of the Calais camp that has left lone children sleeping out in the open is whether it is the result of incompetence or deliberate policy.</p> <p>When the home secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/amber-rudd\">Amber Rudd</a>, and the French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, met on 10 October to finalise plans to close the camp, they say they agreed on the importance of keeping all children safe during the clearance operation.</p> <p>But there appears to have been little discussion of how that was going to happen in practice. The French ambassador to the UK, Sylvie Bermann, disclosed earlier this week that the government rejected a request to take all the lone child refugees to Britain before the camp closure began.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we asked the British government is to take all unaccompanied children, and they said they want to process the cases and check if they have families [in Britain]. It\u2019s impossible for the French to know if they really have families in the UK. So we gave the list to the UK government and now they will have to process [them],\u201d she said on Monday.</p> <p>The result was that the vast majority of child refugees in the camp did not join the 200 who had been brought to Britain in the past week, and were left in the camp to be processed while the demolition went on around them. </p> <p>The only plan that seems to have been put in place is to use the shipping containers to provide shelter for the children on the site once their adult residents had left the camp. </p> <p>But while several hundred children were looked after last night in this way, as night fell more than 100 had been turned away from the containers. </p> <p>Protests that children were being left \u201cin peril\u201d \u2013 from charities, voluntary workers on the ground and politicians including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/yvette-cooper\">Yvette Cooper</a>, the new chair of the Commons\u2019 home affairs committee \u2013 triggered urgent Home Office representations to the French authorities, and some children were found shelter in a school.</p> <p>The Home Office response insisted that it has no jurisdiction to operate on French territory and underlined that it had offered assistance to ensure the safety of children during the clearance process. The statement added that Cazeneuve made a specific commitment to Rudd that his government would continue to take responsibility for all children in Calais during the clearance operation \u2013 including those being assessed for possible transfer to the UK. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3b71f485b59e3578139a908920f63d2835f05295\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b71f485b59e3578139a908920f63d2835f05295/483_0_2589_2465/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In 2015, Theresa May branded the refugees who had reached Calais as the least deserving.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"952\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In 2015, Theresa May branded the refugees who had reached Calais as the least deserving.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah McKay/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But this rushed, \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d response was not made in isolation. For weeks, charities and politicians in Britain have warned of the danger of refugee children going missing and possibly ending up in the hands of traffickers when the camp was closed.</p> <p>The last-minute nature of the Home Office response is underlined by the fact that the government\u2019s official request to local authorities to find places for the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/sites/default/files/Immigration%20Bill%20-%20Unaccompanied%20Children.pdf\">Dubs amendment</a> refugee children was only sent out on 14 October. This quest to find sufficient foster places will not have been helped by the hostile tabloid reception that was given to the first batch of refugee teenagers to be brought to Britain last week.</p> <p>A year ago, though, Theresa May, in her party conference speech, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/06/theresa-may-speech-new-low-politics-migration\">branded those refugees who had reached Calais as the least deserving</a> and announced a much tougher approach that would only provide temporary protection in Britain to the most deserving refugees. The new policy was confirmed when James Brokenshire, then the minister for security and immigration, told the Commons in February that the Home Office would be \u201cmuch tougher\u201d on those who could have claimed asylum in another country first.</p> <p>May has succeeded in insulating Britain from the refugee crisis in Europe \u2013 the largest since the second world war \u2013 and the country is left arguing over whether a few hundred children should be admitted to the UK. Last night\u2019s pictures of child refugees left to sleep out in the open may have been an unintended consequence, but they are the result of a deliberate policy.</p>",

It doesn\u2019t matter if the sufferer has two legs or four or asks for help in words we can understand or with body language that is just as easy to comprehend. Leo Tolstoy, an ethical vegetarian and one of my inspirations, wrote, \u201c[W]e should take pity on animals in the same way as we do on each other. And we all know this, if we do not deaden the voice of our conscience inside us.\u201d </p> <p>The pigs I was trying to help on that fateful day were undoubtedly suffering. Crammed into a transport truck on a sweltering day, these helpless animals \u2013 covered with their own excrement, being crushed together and slowly suffocating from heat \u2013 stared at me through the trailer\u2019s metal slats with their pleading eyes. As Dr Armaiti May, a veterinary expert, testified during my trial, some of the pigs were foaming at the mouth and in \u201csevere distress\u201d, appearing to breathe as quickly as 180 breaths per minute. </p> <p>I think we have not only a right but also a duty to help suffering animals. <a href=\"http://www.torontopigsave.org/about-us/\">Toronto Pig Save</a>, the group that I helped start with my dog Mr Bean in 2010, has continued to give water to thirsty pigs to this day. Our approach is to collectively bear witness to ill-fated animals at the end of their miserable lives and hold weekly vigils outside slaughterhouses.</p> <p>A slaughterhouse might seem like the last place that animal lovers would want to be, but for us \u2013 as for the Quakers, Greenpeace and similar groups \u2013 bearing witness is about being present at sites of great injustice. Our personal contact puts a face on the nameless numbers, to borrow from Charles Dickens, and helps people see animal victims as unique individuals who want to live.</p> <p>There\u2019s little doubt in my mind that if those were dogs in distress in that truck instead of pigs, my actions would be applauded and it would be the driver facing charges instead. This double standard should have everyone questioning the ethics of the meat, dairy and egg industry, our legal system and our food choices. Like dogs, pigs are friendly, loyal and sensitive animals who have a strong sense of self and intelligence. They are playful and affectionate: they love to snuggle. They feel love and joy, but also pain and fear. They possess protective feelings for their families and friends. Pigs have <a href=\"http://www.peta.org/features/reasons-never-eat-bacon/\">been known</a> to courageously jump into water to rescue drowning children. </p> <p>In Esther the Wonder Pig, a New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2016/07/10/animals/\">bestseller</a>, Esther\u2019s human dads attest to the porcine internet star\u2019s big personality, her keen intelligence and her sense of humor. Our laws need to be changed to reflect this: all animals should be treated as thinking, feeling individuals under the law, because that is what they are. They are not property, nor cogs in the machine, with numbered tags slapped on their ears.</p> <p>Humans need to recognize that we are also animals and that we are all interconnected. We are like animals in all the ways that matter \u2013 we feel pain, we suffer, we grieve, we are afraid of being killed and we get thirsty on a hot day. By showing people this, we hope we will reach their hearts so they will feel what animals feel. Then finally we will be able to end the horrific suffering at farms and slaughterhouses and shift towards a nonviolent plant-based economy.</p> <p>We are all in this together, humans and pigs. I am, quite literally, because I am facing jail time for giving pigs some small comfort in their final moments. My trial resumes 1 November. The cruelty inflicted on pigs at animal farms and slaughterhouses touches all of us, by harming animals, by polluting the environment, by harming our health and our conscience when we consume the products of this suffering. By bearing witness to animals in distress, we discover the unity of life.</p>",
  "<p>Have Manchester United turned another corner?

The first half was as formless and forgettable as only early rounds of the League Cup can be, though when Mourinho asked for more application and penetration after the interval he got a response.

We had a strong desire to put everything right after Chelsea, but we need to continue in that way, we need to do it in every single game because no opponents are going to make it easy for us.\u201d</p> <p>Premier League opponents generally do not, though with Burnley and Swansea City sandwiching the away fixture against Fenerbahce in the next couple of weeks United have a little breathing space after fixtures against Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City in quick succession.

Losing at Stamford Bridge is something United supporters have come to accept over the years but it was the manner of the latest defeat, with the suggestion that a Mourinho side was ill-prepared and poorly organised, that came as a surprise.</p> <p>United set themselves up a little differently in their last match, with Michael Carrick replacing Marouane Fellaini in midfield to leave Paul Pogba a freer role, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic dropping a little deeper than usual as the central member of the front three.</p> <p>Previously the Swede has played on his own as the point of attack, against City he was level and at times behind Marcus Rashford and Mata. If the former in particular had accepted all of the openings that came his way United\u2019s win might have been more emphatic, though at least Rashford has made it back to the starting lineup and his understanding with Ibrahimovic can only improve with time.</p> <p>It is likely Mourinho will find himself fielding questions on the whereabouts of Wayne Rooney and Henrikh Mkhitaryan all the way until the next transfer window, but a front three of Rashford, Ibrahimovic and Mata actually offers a good mix of pace, experience and creativity, with Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard available as backup. With the Rooney era looking to be over, United might not have turned a corner so much as turned a page.</p>",
  "<p>In Little Havana, a vibrant Latino neighborhood just west of downtown Miami, a queue of a couple of dozen prospective voters had formed outside one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s field offices.</p> \n<p>Sandwiched between an insurance company and immigration counsel office, the group had arrived for tickets to a free Jennifer Lopez concert. But there was one caveat: to attend the Saturday evening show, at Bayfront Park on Miami\u2019s Biscayne Bay, fans were first required to visit a Clinton campaign field office.</p> \n<p>It was one of the many creative ways in which the Democratic nominee\u2019s campaign was seeking to engage likely voters in the critical battleground of Florida, a state with a key role in determining whether Clinton or her Republican opponent Donald Trump is elected on 8 November as the next president of the United States.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=FL\" data-alt=\"Florida\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=FL\">Florida</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Inside this modest campaign space, one of 82 Clinton field offices in the Sunshine State, yellow-painted walls bore signs that read phrases such as \u201cJuntos Se Puede\u201d (Together We Can) and \u201cWhy build a wall against Hispanics when they built this country?\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cEnglish or Spanish?\u201d a volunteer asked as two sisters stepped into the office hoping to secure a pair of concert tickets. \u201cSpanish,\u201d they responded.</p> \n<p>Azalia and Lucia Rodriguez, both US citizens originally from Nicaragua, had already made up their mind. Trump had hit a nerve, they said, within Florida\u2019s sprawling Hispanic community.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t vote, that\u2019s an extra vote for Trump,\u201d said Lucia, a 19-year-old college student. \u201cI have family members that might be deported, and just to be safe I wouldn\u2019t vote for him.\u201d</p> \n<p>Azalia, a 27-year-old in real estate, put it even more bluntly when asked why she was voting for Clinton: \u201cWell, I\u2019m Hispanic and I don\u2019t like what Trump says.\u201d</p> \n<p>Turnout among Hispanic voters might sway the outcome of the election in a state where one of the fastest-growing demographics in the country holds substantial influence. A half-dozen volunteers worked the phones in both English and Spanish, targeting a list of likely Clinton supporters while making a strong push for the early voting process that began on 24 October.</p> \n<p>The Obama campaign worked out of the same office in 2012, recognizing a shift in demographics. While the Cubans who dominated the area typically voted Republican, a younger generation has in recent years leaned Democratic; and non-Cuban Hispanics, a reliably Democratic voting bloc, also increasingly live in the area.</p> \n<p>In 2000, a controversial recount in Florida determined whether Al Gore or George W Bush would become president. Sixteen years later, the state is still vital terrain in the presidential race \u2013 Trump, trailing Clinton in other must-win swing states, needs to secure the state\u2019s 29 electoral votes to have a path to victory.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--supporting\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a0abf86a-cf7d-402f-a24a-7e2898260047\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   <figure class=\"element element-explainer element-atom\" data-display-type=\"flat\"> \n    <h1>How will the election be decided? </h1> \n    <div>\n     <p>The president is chosen through the electoral college, in which each state is assigned a \n      <gu-note title=\"Vicky Frost 22/9/2016 at 12:21\" data-note-edited-by=\"Vicky Frost\" data-note-edited-date=\"2016-09-22T11:21:30.549Z\" data-click-action=\"collapse\" data-note-id=\"80ca109a-7c23-445f-d54c-9ce6f6ccc7e6\" class=\"note note--start note--end\">\n       \u200bcertain \n      </gu-note>\u200bnumber of \n      <gu-note class=\"note note--start note--end\" data-note-edited-by=\"Vicky Frost\" data-note-edited-date=\"2016-09-22T11:18:42.316Z\" data-click-action=\"collapse\" data-note-id=\"b36c395a-1920-42b2-b57b-faa721b9d586\" title=\"Vicky Frost 22/9/2016 at 12:18\">\n       \u200bvotes called \n      </gu-note>\u200belectoral votes&nbsp;(EVs)\n      <gu-note class=\"note note--start note--end\" data-note-edited-by=\"Vicky Frost\" data-note-edited-date=\"2016-09-22T11:13:04.426Z\" data-click-action=\"collapse\" data-note-id=\"a3e31fdb-e028-4a34-e986-31a419d7747e\" title=\"Vicky Frost 22/9/2016 at 12:13\">\n       \u200b.

  "<p>As the largest city in the world\u2019s most wasteful country, New York generates more than <a href=\"http://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/planyc2030/pdf/planyc_2011_solid_waste.pdf\">14 million tonnes</a><strong> </strong>of trash each year; reputedly (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/27/which-is-the-worlds-most-wasteful-city\">though possibly inaccurately</a>) more than any other city in the world.</p> <p>Not only that, New York is also America\u2019s densest city: its narrow, traffic jam med streets make collecting all that garbage a logistical Gordian knot. And New York is located smack in the centre of the Northeast megalopolis, a giant urban expanse where available land for disposing of garbage is in short supply.<br></p> <p>To deal with these challenges, the city relies on a complex waste-management ecosystem encompassing two city agencies, three modes of transport (trucks, trains and barges), <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/operations/performance/fleet-report.page\">1,668</a> city collection trucks, an additional <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/bic/downloads/pdf/pr/licapproved.pdf\">248</a> private waste hauling companies, and a diverse network of temporary and permanent facilities extending halfway around the world.</p> <h2>A brief history of New York\u2019s waste management</h2> <p>Waste management problems are nothing new for New York. As described in a <a href=\"http://www.archives.nyc/newamsterdam/fernow\">1657 ordinance</a>, when New York was still called New Amsterdam, \u201c\u2026 many burghers and inhabitants throw their rubbish, filth, ashes, dead animals and suchlike things into the public streets to the great inconvenience of the community.\u201d A <a href=\"http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/09/when-horses-posed-a-public-health-hazard/?_r=1\">snapshot</a> from two centuries later depicts a city overrun with horse manure, posing a health hazard for residents.</p> <p>Through most of its history until the mid-1900s, New York\u2019s primary method for disposing of its waste was simply to dump it into the ocean. At one point, as much as 80% of New York\u2019s garbage <a href=\"https://info.ngwa.org/GWOL/pdf/912054804.PDF\">ended up out at sea</a>. However, in what was surely its most enduring waste management initiative, New York City used some of its garbage (mostly ash, rubble and other debris) to <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/5-parts-of-nyc-built-on-garbage-and-waste-1682267605\">create artificial land</a>, thereby increasing its own size. Much of the city\u2019s land today, including some of its priciest neighbourhoods, are literally built on garbage.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://metrocosm.com/where-new-yorkers-come-from/\">1660 map of lower Manhattan</a> overlaid on a current map shows how much of the land is manmade, built on top of the City\u2019s own garbage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b19f5a729ccf481732979fd6068be6f9f62967c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b19f5a729ccf481732979fd6068be6f9f62967c3/3_0_1015_609/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A map of 1660s Manhattan overlaid on modern New York shows how much of the city\u2019s land is manmade.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A map of 1660s Manhattan overlaid on modern New York shows how much of the city\u2019s land is manmade \u2013 largely by ruble and other debris dumped in the water.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: New York Public Libraries/Open Street Map/Max Galka</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Two waste systems \u2013 one public, one private</h2> <p> Today, New York City generates <strong>14 million tonnes </strong>of trash each year. The amount is so large that the city manages it through two separate systems, one public and one private. The public system handles waste from residences and government buildings as well as some non-profits. This \u201cpublic waste,\u201d which accounts for about a quarter of the city\u2019s total, is collected by New York\u2019s Department of Sanitation (DSNY), the largest waste management agency in the world with a <a href=\"http://council.nyc.gov/html/budget/2016/Pre/dos.pdf\">yearly budget</a> of $1.5bn (\u00a31.25bn), greater than the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_government_budgets_by_country\">annual budget of some countries</a>.</p> <p> The other three-quarters of New York\u2019s garbage is generated by commercial businesses, most of it rubble and debris from construction projects. Collection of this \u201cprivate waste\u201d does not come out of the city\u2019s budget. Instead, business must pay one of the City\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/bic/downloads/pdf/pr/licapproved.pdf\">248</a> licensed waste haulers to take it away. Overseeing private trade waste is New York\u2019s Business Integrity Commission, an agency created to rid the carting industry of organised crime. Consistent with the Tony Soprano stereotype, New York\u2019s garbage hauling industry has <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/bic/html/about/history.shtml\">long had ties to organised crime</a>. Today, this corruptive influence has largely been eliminated, and the BIC\u2019s primary function is regulatory oversight and setting price controls.</p> <p>In 2012, New York\u2019s public and private waste management systems spent a combined <a href=\"http://www.cbcny.org/sites/default/files/REPORT_GarbageFacts_05222014.pdf\">$2.3bn</a> on garbage collection and disposal.</p> <h2>The long journey of New York garbage</h2> <p> Before the trash goes out to the curb for pickup, New York law requires it be separated into three categories: paper, metal/glass/plastic, or mixed solid waste (non-recyclable garbage). Each type of waste is typically collected separately and follows a <a href=\"http://www.waste.exposed/\">different path</a> to its ultimate destination, often with several intermediate stops along the way.</p> <p> Each day, New York\u2019s public garbage trucks collect nearly 7,000 tonnes of residential mixed solid waste. After finishing their routes, most of these trucks will deposit the garbage in one of New York\u2019s waste transfer stations located throughout the city. From there, the garbage will eventually be loaded on to a barge or train and carried as far as 600 miles to its final stop. For most of New York\u2019s mixed solid waste (about 80% of it by tonnage), this last stop will be a landfill. The remaining 20% will end up at a waste-to-energy plant, where it will be incinerated and converted into energy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/28/new-york-comes-clean-fresh-kills-staten-island-notorious-dumpsite\">New York comes clean: the story of the notorious Fresh Kills dumpsite</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Paper and metal/glass/plastic waste is brought to one of the City\u2019s recyclables handling and recovery facilities, specialised plants which separate and sort the recyclable materials. From this point, the journey of New York\u2019s recyclable waste splits apart into many possible directions. Some of it will be sold to local raw material processors (paper mills, smelters etc), some will be exported overseas, most often 6,000 or 7,000 miles to China or India, some will be sold through intermediary waste brokers, and some specific items will be separated and sold directly to their end-users (for example, <a href=\"ftp://ftp.dec.state.ny.us/dshm/SWMF/RHRF/RHRF%20Annual%20Reports%20-%202015/R2/03M42_Parallel_Products_of_New_England_mrf_R2_2015.2016-02-24.AR.pdf\">crates to a Coca-Cola bottling plant</a>, or <a href=\"ftp://ftp.dec.state.ny.us/dshm/SWMF/RHRF/RHRF%20Annual%20Reports%20-%202015/R2/03M42_Parallel_Products_of_New_England_mrf_R2_2015.2016-02-24.AR.pdf\">beer kegs to Anheuser-Busch</a>).</p> <ul> <li>New York\u2019s solid waste management facilities are required to submit annual reports documenting the source and destination of all incoming and outgoing waste material.

  "<p>The law could be reformed to make clear that an alleged rape victim\u2019s sexual history must not in future be used routinely as evidence in court, the attorney general has suggested.</p> <p>Jeremy Wright told the House of Commons that concerns about the practice were legitimate, after a group of MPs warned that women would be less likely to report rape because of the high-profile <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/14/footballer-ched-evans-cleared-of-in-retrial\">retrial of the footballer Ched Evans</a>.</p> <p>More than 40 female Labour MPs wrote to Wright expressing their worries after evidence about the sexual history of the complainant was used in the retrial of Evans, a former Wales international who was acquitted this month.</p> <p>Evans was found not guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman following a five-year battle to clear his name. The jury at Cardiff crown court heard from two men who had sex with the complainant around the time of the rape allegation. Such evidence is only allowed in rape trials in exceptional circumstances.</p> <p>Following the case, members of the women\u2019s parliamentary Labour party, including its chair, Jess Phillips, as well as Harriet Harman and Angela Eagle, urged the government to support a change in the law to prevent the sexual history of rape complainants being used routinely to discredit their evidence in court.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1999/23/part/II/chapter/III\"> Section 41 of the Youth and Criminal Evidence Act 1999</a> puts restrictions on what evidence can be put before a court by the defence about an alleged victim\u2019s sexual behaviour, and on the questioning of the complainant. However, a loophole means previous sexual behaviour can be used only in matters of consent \u201cwhen the behaviour is close to the time of the alleged offence and the behaviour is so similar as to not be explained by coincidence\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/rape_and_sexual_offences/yjcea_1999/\">according to the CPS</a>.</p> <p>In the letter to Wright, the MPs wrote that a move towards revisiting the sexual history of complainants in court would \u201cact to make the prosecution of rape cases in the future harder and reporting of these crimes less likely\u201d. </p> <p>Vera Baird, a former solicitor general, said the Evans case put Britain back \u201cprobably about 30 years\u201d in relation to women reporting rape to the police. <br></p> <p>Speaking in the House of Commons, Wright said the subject was a matter of concern and suggested that the law and guidance around the admission of a complainant\u2019s sexual history in criminal trials could be reformed. </p> <p>\u201cThere is concern here, and we need to accept that that concern is sensible and deal with it,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cI think what we need to look at is a number of things. We need to understand more about the decision in this particular case, we need to understand whether a change in the law is appropriate and, if not, whether it is sensible to look at the guidance that is given to judges about when this evidence is admissible and the guidance that judges give to juries about how that evidence should be used. </p> <p>\u201cI think we need to do all of those things before we are in a position to understand what, if any, changes are needed.\u201d <br></p> <p>Wright said the legal provision allowing an alleged victim\u2019s sexual history to be used in evidence was not used routinely. </p> <p>However, he added: \u201cWe must be confident that the message sent to those who may be currently worried about reporting these sorts of offences is not that they are not encouraged to do so, quite the reverse: they are, and we need to make sure that those messages are clear.\u201d </p> <p>The matter was raised by the shadow solicitor general, Nick Thomas-Symonds, who said there were \u201cgrave recent concerns about the admissibility of a complainant\u2019s previous sexual history in rape trials\u201d. </p> <p>He warned that \u201csingle high-profile cases can give rise to wider perceptions about the law\u201d and urged ministers to ensure victims were encouraged to come forward. <br></p>",

  "<p>Satta Kallon sits beneath a thatched roof stirring a pot of rice that bubbles over an open fire. The 52-year-old is cooking, as she does every day, in the outdoor kitchen at Diaspora community school in Montserrado county. Together with three other women, she works without pay. All of them have children or grandchildren in the school.</p> <p>\u201cI do it because I want to encourage the children to learn. When they have food in their bellies they are happy. When they go into class after eating, they feel good,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The food and cooking facilities are provided by <a href=\"https://www.marysmeals.org.uk/\">Mary\u2019s Meals</a>, a Scottish charity that operates across Liberia. The organisation provides a daily school meal to about 140,000 children in 466 public and privately-run schools countrywide.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/31/liberia-turns-to-private-sector-controversial-overhaul-failing-schools\">Liberia turns to the private sector in controversial overhaul of failing schools</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The meals provided are typically rice and peas, or corn-soya blend \u2013 a vitamin-enriched maize porridge \u2013 with a portion of greens, often grown in the school\u2019s gardens with guidance and support from the charity. To qualify for the programme, local communities and parent-teacher associations must agree to provide adequate cooking facilities, safe and secure food storage areas and local volunteers to prepare the food.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.wfp.org/countries/liberia\">Food insecurity across Liberia</a> is acute, particularly in rural areas, where more than half the population lives. </p> <p>Diaspora community school is a private institution, operating on a shoestring budget with a mix of paid and voluntary teachers. Many Liberian parents prefer to send their children to small, community-managed private schools of this kind in the belief that standards are higher than in state-run free schools. </p> <p>Fees are set to cover costs, ranging from 4,000\u20135,000 Liberian dollars (\u00a335-\u00a345) for an academic year. For many parents, however, this is still a struggle.</p> <p>\u201cRight now, a quarter of our pupils are out of school because they haven\u2019t paid fees,\u201d says the principal, Pastor Abraham Sesay. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow them to take their exams if they are out of school. It is hard but if we aren\u2019t strict we can\u2019t keep the school going.\u201d</p> <p>Asatu Massaley, 16, is one of the brightest students in her fifth-grade class. Her education has been badly disrupted by poverty and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/sep/26/ebola-food-shortage-fears-liberia\">Ebola crisis</a>, but she dreams of becoming a nurse so she can provide for her extended family. </p> <p>That ambition will only be realised if she can afford to pay school fees all the way through to 12th grade. Orphaned during the Ebola outbreak, Asatu now lives with her elderly grandmother, Fatu, who is struggling to look after several grandchildren, the offspring of two daughters who both died from the virus. </p> <p>Fatu, who makes a small income selling tobacco, says: \u201cI am old but there is no one else to take care of these children. There is no one to help me. The children have to share food from one small plate. Every day we do not have enough to eat.\u201d </p> <p>For Fatu, sending Asatu to school each morning with a pre-packed meal or providing her cash to buy lunch locally is impossible on top of finding money for fees, books and a school uniform. Food is often the lowest on the priority list. But effective learning is difficult on an empty stomach. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7d885426b90c24321dd0f78e04113f66934cf78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7d885426b90c24321dd0f78e04113f66934cf78/0_99_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children at the Yassa J David Christian academy in Jawajeh, a village in Liberia, prepare for class\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children at the Yassa J David Christian academy in Jawajeh, a village in Liberia, prepare for class.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Holt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The World Bank and the World Food Programme have vouched for the <a href=\"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2634/48742.pdf\">benefits of school feeding programmes</a>, citing evidence that such schemes increase school attendance, cognition, and educational achievement.</p> <p>Research carried out by Mary\u2019s Meals in Malawi, where the charity runs its largest programme, underlines the positive impact of a daily school meal for children growing up in some of the world\u2019s poorest communities. Similar <a href=\"https://www.marysmeals.org/what-we-do/the-impact-of-our-work/\">impact assessment studies</a> are under way in Liberia and Zambia.</p> <p>Alex Keay, head of programmes policy, said: \u201cThe Malawi results demonstrate that a daily meal increases school enrolment numbers and improves attendance, allows children to concentrate better, promotes wider access to education for marginalised children, increases support for community education and makes children happier.\u201d </p> <p>Sesay agrees. \u201cSince they started working with us, I can see we have really seen an improvement. Before they came, we had hungry children who couldn\u2019t concentrate. Now they have lunch they come to class with eager minds. </p> <p>\u201cRegular attendance has improved because if parents know they are getting fed here, it takes pressure off them at home and encourages them to make sure their children come daily.\u201d </p> <p>At Manivalor Mesila public school in Grand Cape Mount county, facilities are even more sparse. Here, 450 pupils learn in just six classrooms with little in the way of furniture or basic learning materials and no access to water or sanitation. In the nursery class, more than 40 children sit on broken wooden benches waiting for a volunteer teacher to arrive. A faded blackboard is the only classroom resource.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the only school nearby and some pupils come from different areas so face a long journey here,\u201d says Isaac Nathaniel, school feeding officer for Mary\u2019s Meals. \u201cFor many pupils, the meal we provide is their only meal of the day because there is nothing to eat when they get home at night. Without it, many children just wouldn\u2019t be able to come because their parents wouldn\u2019t bother to send them or because they would be too weak to walk here.\u201d</p> <p>Mambu, 12, started school when he was eight. \u201cI saw my friends studying here and I was encouraged to come too. My mother is a widow and was worried how we would manage it because it is far, but when I told her that I would receive a daily meal here she agreed for me to come.\u201d</p> <p>Nathaniel believes that without the feeding programme the school would probably have closed due to lack of numbers. It used to be an Islamic school, teaching only a Koranic education in Arabic. Now it offers a mainstream English curriculum, teaching both Christian and Muslim children together. </p> <p>\u201cThe promise of a meal really boosted the intake, that in turn encouraged the school to offer a wider curriculum,\u201d he says. \u201cNow that pupil numbers are secure, we can work with the school to help them improve in wider areas and bring in other NGOs to help with things like the building or sanitation. Feeding pupils is our main purpose but our impact goes beyond that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e51a1fffbfbd28e6cd0b07c813d3a9279ba919f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e51a1fffbfbd28e6cd0b07c813d3a9279ba919f/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bookshelves at a primary school in Montserrado county lie empty apart from a few papers, some green twine and a handbell.

They can retain a majority even when Democrats received far more total votes.

In 2010, they had to take control of all of the chambers. In 2011, they sat down with some of the most skilled mapmakers in the country, and they drew lines with the express intent of using redistricting as a partisan hammer to lock in control of the House for the next decade.</p> </blockquote> <p>The results were dramatic. As Vox\u2019s Andrew Prokop <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/4/15/5604284/us-elections-are-rigged-but-canada-knows-how-to-fix-them\">explained this week</a>, \u201cWhen Americans voted for the House in 2012, Democratic candidates won 1.4 million more votes than Republicans. Yet after the dust settled, the GOP ended up with a 234-201 majority in the chamber.\u201d The liberal blog Daily Kos conducted a comprehensive study of gerrymandering in the 2012 House election and <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/05/13/1382504/-How-gerrymandering-cost-Democrats-the-House-in-2012-Part-1-An-interactive-look-at-alternative-maps\">concluding</a> that it \u201clikely cost Democrats a net of 25 seats in 2012, more than the 17 they needed to claim a majority that year, and far more than the eight they actually did gain.\u201d</p> <p>Take Ohio, for example, which is generally a battleground state in presidential elections and is pretty evenly split between Republicans and Democrats. Because of the radical redistricting Ohio Republicans implemented in 2010, they were able to carve up the map so that they have 75% of Ohio House seats. It\u2019s so bad, a <a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/11/conservative_and_liberal_group.html\">recent study showed</a> you can predict the results of any race in Ohio with a virtual certainty just by knowing the political makeup of a particular district.</p> <p>You can see how gerrymandering can manipulate election results in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/gerrymandering-supreme-court-us-election-north-carolina\">Guardian\u2019s excellent look at</a> \u201cthe nation\u2019s most gerrymandered district\u201d in North Carolina, which was so narrow at one point state representative Mickey Michaux, a Democrat from Durham, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/gerrymandering-supreme-court-us-election-north-carolina\">once said</a>: \u201cIf you drove down the interstate with both car doors open, you\u2019d kill most of the people in the district.\u201d</p> <p>The United States district map <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/01/13/this-is-actually-what-america-would-look-like-without-gerrymandering/\">would look radically different</a> if computers, rather than partisan humans, drew the maps based on US census data. That\u2019s why it\u2019s encouraging that President Obama <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/4/15/5604284/us-elections-are-rigged-but-canada-knows-how-to-fix-them\">will reportedly make redistricting reform</a> a central part of his post-presidency plans. Given the extent to which it affects our elections, it\u2019s an underreported problem \u2013 and until it becomes a national scandal, it will persist.</p> <p>Gerrymandering has several effects beyond just making it easier for one party to control the majority of seats in the House. It drives down voter turnout, since so many elections are lopsided and unopposed. It increases polarization and deadlock in Congress since a lot of congressional members don\u2019t have to worry about a serious challenger from the other party. It also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/09/how-a-widespread-practice-to-politically-empower-african-americans-might-actually-harm-them/\">deprives minority groups</a> of political power.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t a new problem; the practice is <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/us-election/how-does-gerrymandering-work/article32467642/\">almost as old as the country itself</a>, and Democrats have engaged in it as well.

  "<p><em>This article originally appeared on <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/\">STAT</a></em></p> <p>For years, insurers dropped sick people from their plans or denied coverage due to preexisting conditions like cancer, keeping them from the care and medicines they needed.

Specifically, they have imposed specialty <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2016/02/23/cvs-drug-costs/\">tiers and high copays or coinsurance</a> for prescription drugs that effectively force sick people to delay needed care or to find a different health plan. So much for the end of preexisting conditions.</p> <p>Covering fewer sick patients translates to bigger profits for Big Insurance, but less healthcare for those who need it most.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1411376\">recent study from Harvard</a> examined insurers\u2019 use of these tactics. They found 12 plans on the ACA exchanges that discriminated against people with HIV by making them pay $3,000 more a year than those in other plans. This work highlights that such action \u201chas the discriminatory effect of discouraging individuals in need of specific medications from enrolling in these plans or of shifting the burden of the cost back to these enrollees\u201d.</p> <p>Harvard\u2019s Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation recently filed <a href=\"http://www.chlpi.org/chlpi-launches-groundbreaking-campaign-enforce-health-care-rights-people-living-hiv-seven-states/\">a landmark discrimination complaint</a> with the Federal Office for Civil Rights against seven major insurers. The complaint <a href=\"http://www.chlpi.org/health-law-and-policy/projects/#current1\">noted that</a> \u201cUnaffordable cost sharing is just as much a barrier to care as outright refusal to cover medications \u2026 Left unchecked, these practices will drive individuals out of the health insurance market, leaving them once again without meaningful access to care.\u201d</p> <p>States from New York to Florida have attempted to take action against insurance companies found to be engaging in the practices. The federal government should also take a stand \u2013 both under the law and in the spirit of the ACA \u2013 to stop these unfair and discriminatory practices.</p> <p>In June, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Press-releases/2016-Press-releases-items/2016-06-15.html\">announced $22m in funding</a> to state insurance departments earmarked toward \u201cimplementing \u2026 consumer protections including: essential health benefits, preventive services, parity in mental health and substance use disorder benefits, appeals processes, and bringing down the cost of health care coverage (also known as medical loss ratio provision)\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/17/obamacare-insurance-companies-want-to-weaken\">Insurance companies want to weaken Obamacare.

As study after study has shown, that\u2019s simply false. For example, a recent <a href=\"http://avalere.com/expertise/life-sciences/insights/outpatient-services-are-the-largest-driver-of-2017-premium-increases\">independent study from Avalere</a> showed that just 14% of 2017 premiums will be driven by pharmaceutical prices versus about 73% for inpatient, outpatient and professional services. And keep in mind that innovative prescription drugs actually save the healthcare system money over time through reduced surgeries and hospital stays and curbing of doctor visits.</p> <p>The federal government needs to step up and take action against insurance companies that \u2013 while technically barred from dropping people with preexisting conditions \u2013 are nevertheless discriminating against them to achieve the same ends.</p>",

He said he didn\u2019t want to comment on the criminal charges facing Seifert, and had not seen his facilities, but that he had not been aware of any license violations.

  "<p>In many ways I was the stereotype of a troublesome teenager. I used to spend most of my weekends drinking heavily \u2013 sometimes in bars or nightclubs, if I managed to blag my way past the bouncers and could afford it, but more often as part of a group of 20 or 30 kids hanging around in a local park. Illegal drugs like cannabis were fairly common.</p> <p>As is fairly typical of unsupervised, intoxicated teenagers, people would often end up doing stupid things in an attempt to impress their mates. I remember someone breaking into a crown green bowling clubhouse and nicking all the trophies. Another time, a couple of boys ran down the street picking up and smashing plant pots as they went. Inspired, I think, by an episode of The Simpsons, stealing car hood ornaments was briefly a popular activity. I might not have been an instigator, but I wasn\u2019t always an innocent bystander either.</p> <p>Our misbehaviour might have been fairly trivial, but it was still antisocial and reckless. I could have been arrested on dozens of occasions, but my contact with the police was fairly minimal. They sometimes showed up at house parties after neighbours complained about noise and told us to quieten down or go home. Very rarely do I remember anyone being searched for drugs.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The more privileged your background, the more likely that criminal behaviour at this age will be seen as a 'mistake'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the time, I might have put this down to luck. Looking back it seems likely there were other factors at play. It mattered that most of this took place in some of the more affluent postcodes of Sheffield, and that the majority of the kids involved were from so-called \u201cgood families\u201d \u2013 well-spoken and not previously known to the police. Almost certainly, it mattered that most of us were white.</p> <p>Not all communities are policed in the same way. The place you live, the way you look and even your accent affect whether you\u2019re likely to be identified as potentially criminal. Stop-and-search powers are used much more frequently with certain social groups. As <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/britains-upper-classes-are-less-likely-to-be-busted-for-drugs\" title=\"\">Inspector Nick Glynn</a>, vice president of the National Black Police Association, notes: \u201cIf you aren\u2019t well off \u2013 if you\u2019re young, from an urban area, black, or Asian \u2013 your chances of getting stopped by the police for drugs are much higher.\u201d Police rarely bothered anyone where I grew up unless they were called to investigate a specific complaint.</p> <p>Even when caught committing a criminal offence, people are treated differently depending on their background. Researchers at the LSE found that, in London, people from the highest socioeconomic class \u2013 doctors, lawyers, journalists \u2013 were three times more likely to be let off with a caution for drug offences than people who were unemployed. Evidence suggests that experimenting with illegal drugs is <a href=\"http://www.poverty.org.uk/38/index.shtml\" title=\"\">roughly equal across the socioeconomic spectrum</a>, and regular drug use more common among young people, but the vast majority of those in prison for drug offences are not from middle-class backgrounds.</p> <p>A new <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37770576\" title=\"\">report by the commons justice committee</a> has called for offenders aged 18-25 to be treated with more leniency, as \u201ctemperance \u2013 the ability to evaluate the consequences of actions and to limit impulsiveness and risk-taking\u201d is still developing at that age. What it doesn\u2019t acknowledge is that some young people are already afforded that benefit of the doubt.</p> <p>The more privileged your class background, the more likely it is that criminal behaviour at this age will be construed as a \u201cmistake\u201d \u2013 the product of youthful high spirits and something you\u2019ll inevitably grow out of in time. Mostly, this seems to be an accurate assumption. However, the justice committee report notes that incarcerating young people increases the likelihood they\u2019ll enter into a cycle of offending. Labelling people as criminal is often a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/17/governments-448m-troubled-families-scheme-has-had-little-impact-thinktank\">More than \u00a31bn for troubled families 'has had little impact'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s abundantly clear that the rules aren\u2019t the same for everyone.

  "<p>There was an international not so very long ago that was decided by a refereeing decision which was so controversial that the official concerned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/15/craig-joubert-world-cup-scotland-australia-penalty\">sprinted from the pitch</a> when he blew the final whistle a few minutes later. Australia were involved then, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/22/new-zealand-make-history-beat-australia-all-blacks-18-consecutive-wins\">as they were last Saturday</a> when a try that would have seen them draw level with New Zealand with a conversion attempt to come was ruled out by the referee on review.</p> <p>Craig Joubert\u2019s decision to award Australia a penalty in the World Cup quarter-final against Scotland at Twickenham for offside saw him subsequently reprimanded by World Rugby for getting the call wrong.

The player was in an offside position but before he played the ball, it had ricocheted off the Australia scrum-half Nick Phipps. Scotland said that put him onside: the relevant law said Welsh would have been onside had Phipps intentionally played the ball.

His reaction last year was that of someone the decision had benefited. \u201cAt the end of the day, as long as rugby\u2019s been around, that\u2019s what it is. You have to live with the ones you get and the ones you don\u2019t. I\u2019ve become quite neutral on the topic. It\u2019s a penalty and that\u2019s the way it works. You\u2019ve still got to kick it.\u201d</p> <p>He was less neutral on Saturday. \u201cObviously, I can\u2019t say anything because they\u2019ve got you by the throat, but I\u2019ve just never seen shepherding from behind before. I know there\u2019s the ramifications of the game. But at the end of the day, someone\u2019s got to own those mistakes as well. So we\u2019ll see what happens. We\u2019ll see if World Rugby comes out with an announcement or something.\u201d</p> <p>The try was disallowed after the television match official, Shaun Veldsman, called Owens\u2019s attention to an incident involving Haylett-Petty and the New Zealand wing Julian Savea. As Savea tried to catch up with Speight, Haylett-Petty ran across his line and extended his right arm, making contact.</p> <p>The decision to rule out the try was made by Owens after consultation with Veldsman and viewing the incident on the big screen at Eden Park, prompting the former Australia centre Rod Kafer to say that the Welshman should not referee another international match, an outburst he later qualified. Unlike the World Cup quarter-final, the call did not decide the outcome of the match because there were more than 30 minutes to go, but it did alter its momentum.</p> <p>One of the arguments against Owens was that Savea would not have caught Speight. Rule 10.c does not dwell on probability, saying: \u201cA player must not intentionally move or stand in a position that prevents an opponent from tackling a ball carrier.\u201d It does open itself to interpretation because it does not read \u201cfrom attempting to tackle a ball carrier\u201d so a block on a player who had no chance of catching up would implicitly not cancel a try, but if Haylett-Petty had thought Savea had no hope of catching Speight, he would not have tried to make sure.</p> <p>The Australia captain Stephen Moore\u2019s expression in his interview immediately after the end of the match said more than the words he uttered. He was entitled to feel hard done by after a similar incident was reviewed at Twickenham when the Wallabies and England were tied at 13-13 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/02/england-v-australia-live\">at the start of the final quarter in 2013</a>.</p> <p>The match was decided by an Owen Farrell try after he had run between two opponents, one of whom was Moore who just about got his hands to the outside-half without ever threatening to hold on. The referee that day, George Clancy, reviewed the score because <a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=21&amp;v=aPxiZbs_MCw&amp;ebc=ANyPxKrQGZh0c_AKqzzOt8M57NneX3S3uGsXAuzk7IWEzcN9sKFJM2LSoTP3d1tdA1qIqoNJ7_pixcoSwQ_Zg10IWMK9IbJbfA\">Moore\u2019s path to Farrell had initially been blocked by Dylan Hartley</a>.</p> <p>Clancy decided \u201cthere had not been enough obstruction\u201d, although the issue according to 10.c also involved Hartley\u2019s intent, and awarded the try. That begged the question that if Moore had come very close to tackling Farrell having been impeded by Hartley, he would surely have made the challenge tell if given a free run. The only thing that call and Owens\u2019s had in common was that they both went in favour of the home side.</p> <p>The decisions were both made by the referees involved, but the review system is being undermined by television match officials trying to influence the outcome. Veldsman, rightly, asked Owens review the Speight try having spotted Haylett-Petty\u2019s obstruction in real time, but there his role should have ended. In the final minutes of the game, he tried to get Owens to rule that Aaron Cruden\u2019s pass to Israel Dagg had not been forward but the referee stood firm.</p> <p>The review system works more efficiently in American football where the head referee looks into a camera alone and makes up his own mind based on what he sees. He does not have someone babbling advice into his ear: it follows that if a television match official asks a referee to review an incident, he is clear about what he thinks the outcome should be.</p> <p>Reviews are made in American football by the head coaches of the teams involved. They have three each, which can be used for an incident anywhere on the field, and they are penalised if one is not upheld by losing a timeout. With coaches in rugby union all sitting in front of laptops during a match, the same system could be introduced in the sport, without a sanction for a failed review, leaving the TMO to draw a referee\u2019s attention to an act of foul play.</p>",

Every two weeks the <a href=\"http://www.forgoodgovernment.com/\">Citizens of Delaware County for Good Government</a>, a conservative group, meets here primarily to discuss campaigning on local issues. </p> <p>Nationally Hillary Clinton is <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/elections/ \">ahead in most polls</a>; regionally they suggest she is mounting a challenge in states such as <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/card/clinton-campaign-makes-play-arizona-buys-ads-texas-n667706\">Utah, Georgia and even Texas</a>, where Democrats haven\u2019t won in decades; <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/10/what-the-early-voting-numbers-are-telling-us.html\">early voting</a> is on balance looking promising for the DNC. But when I ask the 12 people in the room how many still think he has a shot, they nearly all raise their hands.</p> <p>A reader of this project suggested I contact Hiatt, who told me: \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think the polls are rigged. But I think there\u2019s a hidden vote and people are giving the PC answer they think people want to hear rather than how they\u2019ll actually be inclined to vote.\u201d</p> <p>Secret Trump supporters are waiting to cause an earthquake, goes the theory. To the CDCGG members present, the alternative \u2013 that Trump loses \u2013 is unthinkable. \u201cIf she gets elected ...\u201d says Judy Campbell and then shakes her head where the end of her sentence might be. \u201cPeople can\u2019t seriously be thinking about voting for that woman. I mean what in the world ... What can they be thinking?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA lot of what he\u2019s done and said is indefensible,\u201d says Jim Arnold. \u201cBut when you compare it to what she\u2019s done they\u2019re not comparable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt makes me worry about the intelligence of some of these people,\u201d says Margaret Niccum.</p> <p>\u201cWell you can\u2019t fix that,\u201d says Arnold. </p> <p>More than 50 million people are likely to vote for Trump, even if he goes down in flames. It would be unhelpful to generalise about all of them, reducing them to caricature only to dismiss them. Something is happening here and it behooves people to try to understand it, whether or not they like it. From interviews with a range of Trump voters in Muncie, it\u2019s clear most are not blind to his flaws, even if they wouldn\u2019t necessarily describe them in the manner of his detractors. </p> <p>The CDCGG was originally set up to repeal property taxes in Indiana which the group argued were exorbitant. After a successful campaign, they gained the ear of the governor and won a cap on property taxes statewide, and transformed themselves into a local group rallying around local issues. Mostly small businessmen and retirees, half male, half female, all white, it feels like a reconstitution of the Tea Party. </p> <p>Good government, in this context, means small government; with <a href=\"http://www.ibj.com/articles/58583-muncie-mayor-says-fbi-investigating-city-government\">Muncie\u2019s Democratic administration under investigation by the FBI for corruption</a> they feel like they are pushing at an open door and would push harder if the local Republican hierarchy were not so reticent. The atmosphere in the room is cordial; these are not just ideological allies, with a keen sense of civic engagement \u2013 two are running for local office and the conversation touches on water rates, sewage rates and teachers\u2019 contracts among other things \u2013 but also friends.</p> <p>Only a couple had wanted Trump to win in the Republican primaries earlier this year. Most preferred Ted Cruz, the Texan who has tried to style himself as a Reaganesque disruptor of Republican politics, or Marco Rubio, the Cuban-American senator from Florida. \u201cI would have been happier with almost anyone else,\u201d says Arnold. \u201cI wanted [Ben] Carson, then Cruz then Rubio. Trump would have almost been my last choice.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask if they are worried that he will do something embarrassing again they mostly laugh and nod.</p> <p>Dave Jamison, who is retired and voted for Obama twice, says he thought Trump was an \u201carrogant SOB when he was on The Apprentice\u201d, but his hunting buddies in southern Indiana persuaded him to take a second look and now he\u2019s thinking seriously of voting for him.</p> <p>Jamie Walsh, who is in her early 30s and training to be a mortician, variably describes Trump as \u201cgarbage\u201d and a \u201cword-butcher\u201d. Walsh, who got in contact with the Guardian through this project, grew up in Muncie but moved away because she saw drugs, single parenthood or incarceration claiming her peers on the southside \u2013 the white working class part of town \u2013 and felt the need to escape. She now lives in the Indianapolis suburb of Brownsburg and probably would have voted for John Kasich, one of the more moderate Republicans in the primaries, if she had registered for a party. \u201cI hated Donald Trump during the primaries,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was a mockery.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3f46b0f1f895a60c804d632b3af5de701337d68c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f46b0f1f895a60c804d632b3af5de701337d68c/0_58_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Trump and Pence election sign outside a house near downtown Muncie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Trump and Pence election sign outside a house near downtown Muncie</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Walsh has only voted in a presidential race once: for Obama in 2008.

Everyone can see that.\u201d</p> <p>The question of why they would vote for a man of whom they apparently have such a low opinion brings us to something else that connects most of them: their loathing of Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>It is a disdain of such depths that not a single virtue can be salvaged; a contempt nurtured and tended with such animus and anomie over the decades that she has been in the public eye that any redeeming features she might claim have long been stripped away. \u201cUnlike Hillary, he hasn\u2019t done anything criminal,\u201d says Hiatt. </p> <p>Niccum believes this moment is the culmination of a longstanding plot hatched by the Clintons several years ago. \u201cShe\u2019s been planning this since she was in college,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you let all this stuff go?\u201d asks Walsh, referring to things Clinton has been accused of of late. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy stuff going on in these emails if you read \u2019em. This is all the stuff the crazy people have been talking about for years and now it turns out it\u2019s most likely true ... She\u2019s a professional politician. How do you make millions of dollars as a politician? You\u2019re supposed to be a civil servant.\u201d </p> <p>Jamison is rare among Trump supporters I\u2019ve met, in saying he could vote for Hillary, if Trump were \u201cto go off the deep end again\u201d.</p> <p>But for the overwhelming majority, <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/2/8/1478776/-Why-Do-People-Hate-Hillary-Clinton-So-Much\">Hillary hatred</a> is their driving force. What they see as the apocalyptic scenario of Clinton running the country has them reaching for the largest immovable object to stop her. This cannot simply be dismissed as misogyny. Until just a couple weeks ago Clinton and Trump were running almost even among white women, while white women without college degrees <a href=\"http://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1184a12016ElectionTrackingNo1.pdf\">still favour him 51-42</a>. </p> <p>\u201cWhat has she ever done for women?\u201d asks Campbell. \u201cJust look at the kind of women she has standing behind her.\u201d</p> <p>When Trump called Clinton a \u201cnasty woman\u201d at the last debate he not only faithfully reflected their sentiments \u2013 he actually understated it. They do not only think she is dishonest, they think she is a criminal, scheming, cheating snob who will sell America to the highest bidder and pocket the proceeds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"173ddacb9ab862b73b7405fc4a2c0aefc9336dcc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/173ddacb9ab862b73b7405fc4a2c0aefc9336dcc/160_0_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump window sticker in Muncie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump window sticker in Muncie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Younge for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey look at things through the global order,\u201d says Will Statom, the head of the Delaware Republican party. \u201cA lot of people are looking at Hillary Clinton as nothing good. It\u2019s laughable that she can relate to the middle class \u2013 laughable. They\u2019re elitists. They have always have been elitists. They were elitists in Arkansas. They have just found a way to get ultra rich with that sham called the Clinton Foundation.\u201d</p> <p>There are policies of Trump\u2019s they like too. \u201cUnderneath all the crap there are decent ideas but people don\u2019t see them,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cYou have to go looking for them. That\u2019s his own fault. His position on tax reform, trade reform \u2013 they\u2019re not bad. And the plan to privatise the Veterans Administration, that\u2019s a really good plan.\u201d</p> <p>The US Department of Veterans Affairs is the government agency that is supposed to provide services, including healthcare, to those who have served in the military. It is so notoriously badly run that <a href=\"https://www.armytimes.com/story/entertainment/2015/08/06/jon-stewart-vs-va-how-tv-host-raged-against-red-tape/31207623/\">Jon Stewart made improving it a campaign on The Daily Show</a>. Walsh\u2019s husband served in Iraq and has PTSD and hearing loss, following an IED explosion. The VA care he is entitled to is hard to access and inadequate when he does get it, so he uses his employer\u2019s health insurance instead.</p> <p>\u201cOnce they get home the VA just hands them pills and sends them home,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cBut psychological pills aren\u2019t one size fits all. You need therapy and treatment and they\u2019re not getting that. It\u2019s like a flow chart of pills. It\u2019s a mess. We have soldiers killing themselves in epic proportions and it\u2019s because they\u2019re waiting for care.\u201d</p> <p>For Arnold it\u2019s the supreme court \u2013 currently hanging in the ideological balance after the death of the conservative Justice Antonin Scalia left a four-four split between liberal and conservative judges. \u201cThat can change our lives,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t see how anyone who calls themselves a Christian can vote for her. There\u2019s Roe v Wade, LGBTQ and then she says she\u2019s for the second amendment but then she\u2019ll tell you all the restrictions she\u2019ll put on gun owners.\u201d</p> <p>But the economy is the biggest issue of all in a town like Muncie, which lost much of its manufacturing base as companies moved south. About a third of what was once a thriving blue-collar town lives in poverty; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/oct/25/middletown-muncie-factories-photo-essay-midwest\">huge factory plants lie abandoned</a>, sitting like gigantic art installations depicting the post-industrial era. The broad consensus is that the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which liberalised trade between the US, Canada and Mexico, helped kill the economic life of this town: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/08/hillary-bill-clinton\">an agreement championed by Bill Clinton</a> and supported by Hillary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eff3198f199983f8af88503d0f93057c8c32f681\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eff3198f199983f8af88503d0f93057c8c32f681/0_0_5000_3256/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Indiana Steel &amp; Wire Co used to employ 300 people but closed operations in 2002 and now only two staff members remain on site.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Indiana Steel &amp; Wire Co used to employ 300 people but closed operations in 2002 and now only two staff members remain on site.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Statom drove me around the empty factories, elegising about the loss of both jobs and communities, the tumbledown streets where his grandparents lived and the shuttered buildings where they and his father used to work, he tells me he helped load the last machines on to the trucks in nearby Anderson that took the jobs to Mexico. \u201cI\u2019m not anti-union,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the unions got greedy. That was part of it. And then Nafta did the rest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I like Trump,\u201d says Jamison. \u201cGet America back, middle-class jobs and everything. I think we need some of that.\u201d Do you think those jobs are coming back? I ask Jamison. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The devastation wreaked by that hollowing-out is what Walsh felt the need to escape when she left Muncie. \u201cI have friends from high school who were incarcerated for bank robbery. One of the guys I went to high school was killed not so long ago. My best friend, who has a daughter, she\u2019s on her own. It\u2019s just a mess. People addicted to drugs. There\u2019s nothing to do. It\u2019s a sad situation. It\u2019s textbook of how you create an inner city.\u201d</p> <p>During the primaries, when all but a couple of the Republican contenders had dropped out, Trump did well on the southside where Walsh grew up. The white working class \u2013 and particularly white men without a college degree among whom he leads by a whopping 60-21 \u2013 form a significant part of Trump\u2019s core support. But it would be a mistake to conclude from that that he has the bulk of support in these areas. <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mythology-of-trumps-working-class-support/\">Nationally, Trump supporters are generally wealthier than most Americans</a> and considerable wealthier than those who voted for Clinton. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.dcelectionday.com/2016-2/primary-election-2016/\">Democrats outpolled Republicans by a significant margin</a> during the primaries in most, if not all the southside precincts in Muncie. Bernie Sanders, the \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d insurgent on the Democratic side, got more votes than Trump on the southside and even though Clinton lost to Sanders there, she wasn\u2019t far behind Trump in vote totals.</p> <p>\u201cNobody speaks up for the poor,\u201d says Walsh, explaining Trump\u2019s appeal to those she grew up with. \u201cThere is systemic racism but black people have advocates. Poor white people don\u2019t. They\u2019re afraid. They\u2019re afraid that they\u2019re stupid. They don\u2019t feel racist, they don\u2019t feel sexist, they don\u2019t want to offend people or say the wrong thing. But for them white privilege is like a blessing and a curse if you\u2019re poor. The whole idea pisses poor white people off because they\u2019ve never experienced it on a level that they understand. </p> <p>\u201cYou hear privilege and you think money and opportunity and they don\u2019t have it. I understand how it works but I don\u2019t think most people do. So when Trump says stuff, they can understand what he\u2019s saying and he speaks to them in a way other people don\u2019t. And then you\u2019ve got people calling them stupid and deplorable. Well how long do you think you can call people stupid and deplorable before they get mad?\u201d</p> <p><em>Pictures by David Levene and Gary Younge</em></p> <ul> <li><em>Producing in-depth, thoughtful, well-reported journalism is expensive \u2013 but supporting us isn\u2019t.

  "<p>The only journalist whose conviction for payments to public officials under Operation Elveden was still standing has had his guilty verdict overturned by the court of appeal. </p> <p>Sun crime reporter Anthony France <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/may/29/sun-journalist-sentence-anthony-france\">was found guilty in May last year </a>of aiding and abetting a police officer working for a counter-terrorism command squad to commit misconduct in a public office. </p> <p>He was sentenced to 18 months\u2019 prison, suspended for two years, and ordered to carry out 200 hours of community service.</p> <p>After the result of his appeal was announced by Lady Justice Hallett, France was congratulated by supporters outside court.</p> <p>He said: \u201cI am delighted that this serious miscarriage of justice has ended today, allowing me to rebuild my life after 1,379 days of sheer hell.\u201d </p> <p>Sun publisher News UK said: \u201cToday Anthony France\u2019s conviction has been overturned on appeal and we are delighted that these proceedings are now over for him. In the course of the last five years, 19 journalists from the Sun were prosecuted as a result of Operation Elveden and not one has resulted in any conviction being upheld.\u201d</p> <p>In a written judgment, the court said the judge in France\u2019s original trial should have give more detailed directions to the jury in what was a \u201ccomplex area of the law\u201d. In particular, it said that the the jury should have had more direction on how to assess the seriousness of harm caused by the information provided to France, and more detailed instruction on how to evaluate the public interest.</p> <p>It said that the \u201ccumulative\u201d effect of the court\u2019s criticisms meant the conviction was unsafe.</p> <p>The ruling said: \u201cTaking any one of those criticisms in isolation, we may not have been persuaded the summing up rendered the conviction unsafe. However, we must consider their cumulative effect and read the summing-up as a whole.</p> <p>\u201cHaving done so, we are driven to the conclusion that the jury were not provided with legally adequate directions tailored to the circumstances of the case and that the conviction is unsafe.\u201d</p> <p>The decision mirrors the one handed down by the court of appeal when it quashed the conviction of a News of the World reporter for similar offences in March 2015.</p> <p>Later that month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/31/crown-prosecution-service-to-review-charges-under-operation-elveden\">the Crown Prosecution Service launched a review</a> of its policy of prosecuting journalists under Operation Elveden.</p> <p>Bob Satchwell, executive director of the Society of Editors, said the case showed journalists needed greater protection when working in the public interest.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIn most of the cases in which journalists were charged ordinary members of the public who made up juries clearly decided that journalists were working in the public interest.</p> <p>\u201cThe police and the Crown Prosecution Service need to think more carefully before they charge journalists for informing the public. Careers and lives were destroyed by the over-long and hugely expensive police investigation.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 October 2016.

  "<p>On the afternoon of 19 October, Claudia Arias and her aunt Susana Ortiz made their way to the centre of Mendoza, where they joined a crowd of thousands who had gathered to protest against a wave of violent attacks on women in Argentina.</p> <p>It was one of half a dozen demonstrations across the country, organised on social media by a loose collective of activists and journalists after the rape and murder of a 16-year old schoolgirl, Luc\u00eda P\u00e9rez, in the coastal city of Mar del Plata.</p> <p>Their message was #NiUnaMenos, which literally translates as \u201cnot one less\u201d, but signifies \u201cnot one more woman\u201d lost to violence, often committed by victims\u2019 husbands, partners or close friends.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/24/niunamenos-marchers-argentina-women-gender-violence\">Why the #NiUnaMenos marchers are demanding a better Argentina for women | Soledad Vallejos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Four days after Arias and Ortiz protested in Mendoza, they were stabbed to death at their home along with Arias\u2019s 90-year old grandmother, Vicenta D\u00edaz.</p> <p>Police arrested Arias\u2019s ex-partner, Daniel Zalazar, a 30-year-old taekwondo instructor. Prosecutors say he murdered the women after an argument over the paternity of Arias\u2019s seven-month-old daughter, Mia. </p> <p>Zalazar also allegedly stabbed the baby and Arias\u2019s 11-year-old son, Lucas, both of whom remain in critical condition at a Mendoza hospital. Arias\u2019s younger son, Bautista, managed to escape from the house and hid in the boot of a car with his dog, Coco, police said on Wednesday. Officers said it took the eight-year-old several hours to reopen the boot from the inside and then call the police.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a massacre,\u201d Claudia\u2019s father, Rolo Arias, told reporters. \u201cWe went to protest at the #NiUnaMenos marches \u2013 and then it was our turn.\u201d<br></p> <p>Zalazar was held after showing up at a nearby hospital asking to be treated for wounds he claimed he had sustained in a holdup attempt.

And although Argentina does not head the list, almost daily reports of male violence against women have provoked deep soul-searching in the country.</p> <p>Four years ago, congress passed a law defining domestic violence, gender-based killings and other categories of hate crimes against women as \u201cfemicide\u201d. But activists argue that Argentina needs to change more than its legislation.</p> <p> \u201cThe reason [for these attacks] is Argentina\u2019s macho culture,\u201d said Fabiana Tu\u00f1ez, director of Casa del Encuentro, a shelter for abused women in Buenos Aires.<br><br>Machismo runs deeps in Argentina, and manifests itself daily on any city street. Directing flirtatious comments \u2013 known as <em>piropos</em> \u2013 at passing women is considered an art form by many men, although it often consists of little more than crude catcalls and aggressive propositioning.</p> <p>Even the president, Mauricio Macri, has defended the practice. \u201cDeep inside, all women like to hear a <em>piropo</em>, even women who say they don\u2019t,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_uVZELQ4XE\">Macri said in a radio interview</a> in 2014 when he was mayor of Buenos Aires.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe them. There can\u2019t be anything nicer than being told how pretty you are, even if it comes along with vulgarity, like being told what a nice ass you have.\u201d<br></p> <p>Human rights campaigners argue that such behaviour is symptomatic of a culture that refuses to see women as worthy of respect.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s always been violence against women in Argentina, but we\u2019ve noticed that it\u2019s been getting worse lately,\u201d said Sabrina Cartabia, one of the organisers of last week\u2019s protests.<br></p> <p>Cartabia believes the increasingly violent attacks can be seen as a crude response to recent gains made by women in Argentinian society, such as laws reserving 30% of elected positions for women. There are now more female university students than males \u2013 and statistics show they perform better academically. </p> <p>\u201cThe violence is a reaction that wants to put us back into a traditional role where we don\u2019t fit any more,\u201d Cartabia said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f0de4497768863669da6b35ff9047de188dbc52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f0de4497768863669da6b35ff9047de188dbc52/26_0_653_392/500.jpg\" alt=\"Claudio Arias, right, with her ex-partner Daniel Zalazar, who was arrested over her murder and the killing of her aunt Susana Ortiz.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claudio Arias, right, with her ex-partner Daniel Zalazar, who was arrested over her murder and the killing of her aunt Susana Ortiz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Clarin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>News reports of the Mendoza killings stirred a terrible sense of deja vu for Jimena Aduriz. In 2013 her 16-year-old daughter, Angeles Rawson, was abducted as she returned to her apartment from a nearby gym class in the Colegiales neighbourhood of Buenos Aires. Her body was later found at a recycling centre, wrapped in a garbage bag.</p> <p>Last year Rawson\u2019s attacker, Jorge Mangeri, a caretaker, was sentenced to life imprisonment after one of the first convictions under the femicide legislation. </p> <p>Aduriz argues that Argentinians need to reconsider the way they think about such crimes. \u201cWe have to make people understand that gender violence doesn\u2019t start with the first blow, it starts when the man begins to control the woman, to mistreat her, humiliate her publicly, to tell her what to wear,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work put into reducing her self-esteem, so by the time the blow arrives the behaviour has been naturalised.\u201d<br></p> <p>Aduriz\u2019s painful experience has taught her that victims of violence should not be silent. \u201cWomen suffering gender violence have to speak out, they have to report it, and people who are witnesses to someone suffering must not leave them on their own.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/21/we-live-in-constant-fear-argentinas-women-on-marching-against-violence\">'We live in constant fear': Argentina's women on marching against violence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Three years after her daughter\u2019s murder, Aduriz is still struggling with the loss. \u201cYou have to find some way to give the pain a new meaning with whatever tool you have at hand \u2013 your faith, some kind of service, or helping to educate people about this.\u201d</p> <p>Aduriz has channeled her pain into volunteer work at the National Council for Women and at the Uguet Mondaca shelter for women in the Buenos Aires suburb of Burzaco.</p> <p>\u201cIn the media you only hear about the most extreme cases, but the reality is that many lives are being saved thanks to the increasing awareness,\u201d she said. \u201cI see it at the shelter, many women are now able to escape from abuse and mistreatment thanks to what\u2019s now being done.\u201d</p> <p>But she admits that sometimes she feels nothing will ever heal the wound. \u201cIt\u2019s a pain that doesn\u2019t stop with putting the killer in jail,\u201d Aduriz said. \u201cI\u2019m very religious and I know I will meet my daughter again in heaven, but meanwhile I have to continue my life on earth without her.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>There are no instructions in Fifa\u2019s Laws of the Game for what to do when the ground starts to shift beneath your feet. The second of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/central-italy-rocked-by-two-earthquakes-two-hours-apart\">Wednesday night\u2019s earthquakes</a> in central Italy struck at 9.18pm, at a time when nine Serie A matches were in progress, and was felt inside several football grounds.</p> <p>Only one fixture \u2013 Pescara-Atalanta \u2013 was suspended as a result, and even then only briefly. Not all fans were pleased by referee Marco Guida\u2019s decision to resume play after a two-minute pause, and a number abandoned the stadium. Although the tremors felt at the Stadio Adriatico were not too severe, anxieties continue to run high after the catastrophic earthquake in Amatrice in August.</p> <p>Further disruption to Serie A\u2019s midweek schedule arrived 175 miles away to the north. Fiorentina, having already been obliged to abandon one match, away to Genoa, this season due to inclement weather, feared they might need to do so a second time as torrential rain forced players off the pitch midway through the first half of their their match at home to Crotone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/24/milans-young-blood-a-big-deal-after-coming-of-age-in-victory-over-juventus\">Milan's young blood 'a big deal' after coming of age in victory over Juventus | Paolo Bandini</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Play eventually resumed after a delay of almost an hour, though the <em>Viola</em> might wish that it hadn\u2019t. On a pitch that had become a puddle, they could only draw 1-1 against their last-placed opponents.</p> <p>There was no such interruption at the Stadio Mapei, where Sassuolo hosted Roma, but the visiting supporters here, too, walked away contemplating acts of God. Not the kind that lawyers refer to when discussing natural disasters, but rather the sort that might occur on the stage of a silver-tongued evangelical faith healer.</p> <p>Before their own eyes, a man\u2019s sight has been restored to him. All through last season Roma\u2019s fans had teasingly referred to their own striker, Edin Dzeko, as Edin <em>Cieco</em> \u2013 Edin the Blind. The former Manchester City striker had all the physical tools to be a top-notch No9, but when the time came to take a shot on goal, he never quite seemed to see straight.</p> <p>His misses were often extraordinary. Presented with an open goal from point-blank range against Palermo, he somehow contrived to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqMeWAtKW0\">pass the ball wide of the far post</a>. Against Atalanta he did the hard work, rounding goalkeeper Marco Sportiello, only to then pelt his shot <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct2UTV4TpwI&amp;t=1m56s\">clumsily over the bar</a>.</p> <p>During his worst stretch, from mid-November 2015 through to February 2016, Dzeko went 11 hours and 50 minutes without scoring a goal in Serie A. In fact, if you take two successful penalties out of the equation, this dry run could be said to have begun in September, and stretched to an incredible 23 hours and 32 minutes.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult for attackers in Italy,\u201d explained Dzeko this week, \u201cbecause there are always two defenders marking you.\u201d It is a claim supported by countless others who have made the switch to Serie A from other European leagues, but still does not justify his inability to stick a ball into an unguarded net from two yards out.</p> <p>Plainly, confidence was a factor. Unrealistic expectations had been dumped on Dzeko\u2019s shoulders from the moment he touched down at Fiumicino airport in August 2015 to find thousands of Roma supporters waiting. This club has been craving an heir to Gabriel Batistuta for more than a decade. Those are some intimidating boots to fill.</p> <p>Dzeko will never be as brilliant as the Argentinian, possessing neither the technique nor finesse. But at this rate, he might just join Batistuta in the elite group of players who have scored 20 goals in a season for Roma. A brace on Wednesday night gives him 10 in as many league matches so far in 2016-17. That is two more, already, than he achieved in his entire previous Serie A campaign.</p> <p>Better yet, he is delivering in those moments when his team needs him most. Roma had fallen behind early away at Sassuolo on Wednesday, putting themselves at risk of losing the ground that they made up on Juventus over the weekend. They were still trailing in the 57th minute, when Mohamed Salah played Dzeko through on goal.</p> <p>Last season, he might have rushed his shot and fired off target. This time, he took a touch before picking out the bottom corner with an elegant side-footed finish.</p> <p>It was Dzeko who then won, and converted, the penalty that gave Roma the lead. Two minutes after that, his knock-down for Stephan El Shaarawy in midfield launched a counter-attack that concluded with Radja Nainggolan slotting home from close range. It was enough to seal a 3-1 victory for the <em>Giallorossi</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be33f3eabf2415f955d2ae889f4b663874fbf4f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be33f3eabf2415f955d2ae889f4b663874fbf4f1/0_0_3072_2055/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roma\u2019s Radja Nainggolan celebrates his goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roma\u2019s Radja Nainggolan celebrates his goal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elisabetta Baracchi/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe credit is all his,\u201d replied Luciano Spalletti, when asked about Dzeko\u2019s improved form. The reality might be more nuanced. Roma\u2019s wide players are doing a better job of playing off the striker, the likes of Salah, El Shaarawy and Diego Perotti working to get the ball into his feet rather than going it alone or swinging in aimless crosses.</p> <p>As a result, Dzeko is enjoying far more scoring opportunities. He has averaged 5.2 shots per game, almost twice as many as he had last season \u2013 and more than any other Serie A player by a wide margin (Ciro Immobile sits second in this category with 4.3). Dzeko\u2019s efficiency in front of goal has improved, but less drastically than you might imagine.</p> <p>Spalletti will not mind how many shots are required, as long as his team keeps on scoring at its present clip. As a team, Roma have piled up 26 goals in Serie A already.</p> <p>They did suffer a significant blow on Wednesday, when Alessandro Florenzi left the match against Sassuolo on a stretcher. It has since been confirmed that he suffered a torn cruciate ligament. His absence will hurt Roma, depriving them of both a talented player who lends consistent support to the attack from right-back, and a leader in the changing room.</p> <p>But injuries, just like earthquakes, are beyond the control of any manager. Even one who found a way to restore sight to the blind.</p> <h2>Talking points</h2> <p>\u2022 Before we move on from Roma and Spalletti, I should also call attention to his colourful press conferences over the past few days. Frustrated to be asked a question about the \u201catmosphere\u201d around the team after Sunday\u2019s 4-1 win over Palermo, he responded by thumping his head repeatedly on the desk. (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/pepromano/status/790499277512515588\">See the viral version, set to We Will Rock You, here</a>.) Then, at his pre-Sassuolo press conference on Tuesday, he told the same journalist that he would only respond to questions from people who say \u2018Forza Roma\u2019. Happily, for the sake of press freedom, the journalist in question refused, and the conversation moved on with Spalletti not holding to this line. </p> <p>\u2022 Roma are not the only team from the capital with the bit between their teeth right now. Lazio thrashed Cagliari 4-1 on Wednesday night, lifting themselves to fifth. Immobile has six goals in his last four games. </p> <p>\u2022 Three days after beating Juventus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/24/milans-young-blood-a-big-deal-after-coming-of-age-in-victory-over-juventus\">Milan got walloped 3-0 away at Genoa</a>. This was a reality check for a team that \u2013 for all its youthful optimism \u2013 does still lack the depth for a serious title challenge. Vincenzo Montella made only two changes to his starting XI, but both of them were disastrous \u2013 Andrea Poli replacing Ignazio Abate at right-back and failing to pick up his man on Genoa\u2019s first goal, while Keisuke Honda came in for Suso on the right side of attack, and contributed absolutely nothing. Of course, it didn\u2019t help that Gabriel Paletta got himself sent off for an absurdly reckless challenge at the start of the second-half either. </p> <p>\u2022 Juventus, of course, bounced back with a win, beating Sampdoria 4-1 at home. Encouraging notes for the champions included Claudio Marchisio\u2019s first appearance in 192 days, as well as Mario Mandzukic\u2019s first goal for the club since April. </p> <p>\u2022 Frank De Boer lives to fight another day at Inter, and has Joe Hart to thank. The goalkeeper, so steady in recent weeks, made a costly blunder as he rushed out to intercept a through-ball but failed to claim it, instead allowing the ball to bounce off his body, on to the boot of Mauro Icardi and back into the net. Torino did subsequently pull level, but the Argentinian scored again to secure a much-needed win for the <em>Nerazzurri</em>. Icardi had not scored in six games \u2013 the longest dry run of his Inter career \u2013 but, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/17/mauro-icardi-v-inters-ultras-an-unhappy-chapter-in-his-ongoing-san-siro-saga\">ill-advised autobiographies notwithstanding</a>, he should not carry the can for the team\u2019s loss of form. He has scored eight times for Inter in Serie A this season, whilst his team-mates have mustered just five strikes between them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07baf504f47e39e52f2c7eed50ba179e6847e188\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07baf504f47e39e52f2c7eed50ba179e6847e188/2_0_3142_1757/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mauro Icardi bundles the ball through Joe Hart and into the net.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"559\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mauro Icardi bundles the ball through Joe Hart and into the net.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IPA/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> \u2022 If you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a b \u2026 ah, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IFTV_Official/status/791375547096002560\">never mind Mauro</a>. </p> <p>\u2022 The good news for Napoli, ahead of Saturday\u2019s showdown with Juventus, is that Dries Mertens did an excellent job leading the line in the absence of Arkadiusz Milik and Manolo Gabbiadini. The even better news is that they finally managed to keep a clean sheet on Wednesday \u2013 their first in six games. After the game, Mertens was asked whether he might share a joke with Gonzalo Higua\u00edn when they meet again at the weekend. \u201cAt the most we\u2019d like to give him a slap,\u201d replied the

  "<p>As the nights lengthen and temperatures nosedive, staying indoors becomes more tempting. But for homeless people there is no such luxury, and while sleeping rough is never an enjoyable prospect, it becomes even more dangerous \u2013 and often fatal \u2013 in the winter months.</p> <p>Homelessness rates have risen dramatically, with rough sleeping <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/25/homeless-number-people-sleeping-rough-england-rises-almost-a-third-in-a-year\">doubling since 2010 and increasing by 30% in the last year</a>, leaving huge numbers of people at risk. , </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/oct/21/council-fining-homeless-people-for-being-homeless-cruel-unworkable\">Fining homeless people for being homeless is cruel and unworkable</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Local councils have a duty to help rough sleepers during inclement weather and most have strict policies in place.

If you\u2019ve seen someone sleeping rough regularly and are concerned for their welfare, you can contact homeless outreach workers directly. \u201cA first port of call is <a href=\"http://www.streetlink.org.uk/\">StreetLink</a>, a safe and confidential way to alert specialist homelessness outreach teams if you see someone sleeping rough,\u201d says Downie. \u201cOf course, you can always stop for a chat and offer to buy someone a cup of tea \u2013 a bit of human contact could make a huge difference.\u201d</p> <p>If you\u2019re in England or Wales, you can save the StreetLink number in your phone to save time looking it up in an emergency. Homeless Link has also developed an app for both <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/streetlink/id587543230?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.uk.precedent.streetlink&amp;hl=en_GB\">Android</a>. <a href=\"http://www.homelessdublin.ie/help-someone-who-sleeping-rough\">Dublin city has its own version</a> with information on how the city council helps homeless people. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"93a9bd454deb572c4aacb3c8e8ecd7cb6470c242\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93a9bd454deb572c4aacb3c8e8ecd7cb6470c242/0_0_320_568/282.jpg\" alt=\"StreetLink app\" width=\"282\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You can alert specialists by StreetLink if you see someone sleeping rough.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Homeless Link</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Scotland, there is no centralised service such as StreetLink, so Scottish readers should check for local services that may be able to help. In Edinburgh, <a href=\"http://www.streetwork.org.uk/\">the housing charity Streetwork</a> fields calls from the public to target help in addition to its outreach work. Head of services Jan Williamson says the charity has teams out on the streets of Edinburgh every day. \u201cWhen we receive a call from the public, the team goes along to the area the person was last seen so that we can offer them our support, or help them to engage with the services they need.\u201d</p> <p>Graeme Brown, director of Shelter Scotland,  says everyone has a right to access emergency temporary accommodation from their local council if they have nowhere else to stay. \u201cIf you are concerned about someone who is sleeping rough you can contact your local council who can offer help directly or through a local charity,\u201d he says. Shelter Scotland also has a free helpline number: 0808 800 4444. </p> <h2>Emergencies</h2> <p>If you\u2019re immediately concerned for someone\u2019s life or believe they are very young, you should always call the emergency services. Whether contacting StreetLink or other outreach services, or the emergency services, try to give as much detail as possible. If you\u2019ve seen the individual repeatedly, that will give an idea of how long they have been sleeping rough. Details about someone\u2019s clothing and appearance can help identify them if they move elsewhere in the area while outreach workers or ambulance staff are attempting to locate them.</p> <h2>Volunteer or donate</h2> <p>Many homelessness charities regularly recruit volunteers to undertake longer term help \u2013 anything from befriending to advice, healthcare and helping out in charity shops. \u201cAnother way you can offer help is to volunteer for <a href=\"http://www.crisis.org.uk/pages/volunteer-christmas.html\">Crisis at Christmas</a>,\u201d says Downie. \u201cEach year we recruit 10,000 volunteers to provide comfort, warmth and vital services for homeless people over the festive period.\u201d</p> <p>Many homeless shelters will offer help over Christmas, and while there are general roles, people with particular skills, from advocacy and advice professionals to dental nurses and occupational therapists, are particularly sought after to give targeted health and pastoral services to rough sleepers in shelters and day centres.</p> <p>If you\u2019re short on time, but want to help, regular or one-off donations are always welcomed by charities.And after the festive season, you can always donate unwanted socks and underwear, unopened toiletries, clothes and food. Many charities, <a href=\"http://www.mungos.org/how_you_can_help/make_a_donation/donate_gifts_kind\">such as St Mungo\u2019s</a> or <a href=\"http://www.oxhop.org.uk/howyoucanhelp/giftsinkind/\">Oxford Homelessness Pathways</a>, accept these, providing they are new. Sites will give guidance on what gifts they can accept, but as a general rule, if you would be affronted to receive something yourself, your intended recipient might not be thrilled either. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/sep/14/lessons-from-finland-helping-homeless-housing-model-homes\">Lessons from Finland: helping homeless people starts with giving them homes</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Campaign</h2> <p>Helping individuals in crisis is important, but the fact that homelessness has risen so sharply in the <a href=\"http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/GDP.pdf\">fifth richest economy in the world [pdf</a>] is clearly unacceptable.

We continued to make good progress on restructuring the bank.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, in the past several weeks these positive developments were overshadowed by the attention around our negotiations concerning the residential mortgage backed securities matter in the United States. This had an unsettling effect. The bank is working hard on achieving a resolution of this issue as soon as possible.\u201d <br></p> <p>He warned <a href=\"https://www.db.com/newsroom_news/2016/ghp/a-message-from-john-cryan-on-deutsche-bank-s-third-quarter-financial-results-2016-en-11734.htm\">staff in a memo</a> that \u201cthe situation will remain tough for some time to come\u201d.</p> <p>Revenues were depressed and there were some outflows, the bank acknowledged, as a result of anxiety about its ability to pay the penalty. The bank\u2019s liquid assets \u2013 ones it can use quickly to pay demands for cash \u2013 fell \u20ac23bn to \u20ac200bn between the end of June and the end of September. But Marcus Schenck, the finance director, said this had now stabilised.</p> <p>Cryan has made clear that Deutsche \u2013 which employs around 8,000 people in the UK \u2013 does not expect the final bill to be as high as $14bn and has dismissed reports that the bank has called on the German government for help.</p> <p>Deutsche\u2019s shares plunged last month to levels they last traded at in the 1980s, slipping through \u20ac10, and the bank acknowledged that the anxiety about the DoJ settlement had knocked its business. On Thursday its shares were trading at around \u20ac13. A year ago they were at \u20ac27.</p> <p>Cryan told analysts that reaching a deal with the DoJ and handling other litigation was his \u201ctop priority\u201d but the timing is not under his control.</p> <p>He admitted the ongoing talks were creating uncertainty: \u201cUncertainty that affects the market\u2019s view of Deutsche Bank as an investment, uncertainty that affected some clients\u2019 view of Deutsche Bank as a counterparty and uncertainty that even affects our financial planning and strategy execution.\u201d</p> <p>Cryan, a Briton who has been at the helm of Germany\u2019s biggest bank since last year, said he was personally spending time with clients and attempting to \u201cdispel some of the more lurid myths\u201d about the bank.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that when our name is in the headlines for the wrong reasons, our phone doesn\u2019t ring as frequently,\u201d said Cryan, who dismissed suggestions that investors were questioning his strategy for the bank.</p> <p>The sale of Postbank \u2013 Deutsche\u2019s high street operation \u2013 would not be rushed, he said, until an attractive offer was received. Cryan said he wanted to keep the asset management arm, which is currently being reviewed and is often regarded as a possible business for Deutsche to sell, as an integral part of the group.</p> <p>The profits were a dramatic improvement on the same period last year when Deutsche made a \u20ac6bn loss. For the nine-month period, a loss of \u20ac3bn has been reversed to a \u20ac1.6bn profit.</p> <p>Schenck said a decision had not been made on how bonuses would be paid to staff, but indicated that less would be paid out in cash and more in shares. \u201cIn what form variable compensation will be paid is not yet decided.

  "<p>As local authorities grapple with the challenges of the Care Act, it is becoming clear that significant change is required in the way that adult social care is managed and delivered. The UK needs a successful modern care system that addresses both personalisation and value for money.</p> <p>While the personalisation agenda aims to allow choice and flexibility in care provision and how people manage their money, the feedback from the local authorities I spoke to at this year\u2019s Local Government Strategy Forum is that this agenda cannot be easily fulfilled using the methods in practice today.</p> <p>Some local authorities had already begun or completed strategic reviews of their social care systems with the aim of finding a better way. Many had found that personalisation created challenges \u2013 particularly in care management and financial reconciliation processes, but also in the development of diversity in care provision. </p> <p>There were also widespread complaints about increasingly siloed care information \u2013 for example, between those using direct payments and authority-managed care, and between council and self-funded recipients. These silos mean there is a lack of understanding about what types of care will be needed tomorrow and by whom \u2013 and crucially whether money is being well spent. Many concluded that the only answer to these problems is radical change.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/may/23/care-act-one-year-on\">The new era promised by the Care Act is yet to arrive</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Conflicting responsibilities</h2> <p>Local authorities\u2019 main challenge in adult social care is delivering the demands of the Care Act. It is their responsibility to support anyone needing care in their area, to offer alternatives that are more cost effective, to give the customer precisely the amount of financial freedom they want and ultimately to personalise care. Some of these responsibilities can conflict. For instance:<br></p> <ul> <li>How do we keep track of what individuals are spending their money on through their personal budgets, and ensuring maximum benefit, while giving them control?</li> <li>How can you offer a broader range of (possibly cheaper) care alternatives and suppliers when your supply strategy has previously been founded on the bulk-buying of care from fewer providers?</li> <li>How do you accurately anticipate and plan when you have little information on what care-related services people are searching for and buying?</li> <li>How do you know what alternative services are required when you have no knowledge of emerging demand?</li> <li>With personalisation creating more work for frontline social care teams, how can social workers focus on giving support to those who need it most?</li> </ul> <p>My calculations, based on sector data, produce interesting results. <a href=\"http://www.younifi.co.uk/\">We </a><a href=\"http://www.younifi.co.uk/\">at Younifi</a> looked at three areas of change that could impact how much councils save on adult social care budgets. Our recommendations include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Diversification of the supply base</strong> to offer more, lower cost care alternatives. </li> <li><strong>Technology integration</strong>, bringing disparate initiatives together \u2013 such as purchasing and financial control, case management, and information and advice.</li> <li><strong>Culture change inside the authority</strong>, focusing effort where it really matters while automating resource-intensive processes.<br></li> </ul> <h2>\u2018Quick-win\u2019 savings</h2> <p>Our estimations are that \u201cquick win\u201d savings of at least \u00a3186m per annum are easily possible. Over \u00a371m could be taken off council administration costs through automated financial transaction management. Over \u00a373m could be saved on better use of direct payments, proactively diverting people towards more cost-effective care alternatives and through retention of unspent money. Councils could then use the unspent money to support more people or invest in more preventative services. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/may/27/personal-budgets-control-their-own-support-and-their-own-lives\">Personal budgets allow people to control their own support and their own lives</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finally, over \u00a340m could be saved on staffing by simplifying administrative processes in the management of care services. These savings could be made on reviews and assessments, supplier contract monitoring and arranging care for people.</p> <p>The market, cultural and technological changes needed to make this happen would also provide the groundwork for a more cost-efficient and personalised care system in the future. </p> <p>More than anything else, councils need to rethink their position in the care system. Instead of being care providers, they need to consider their responsibilities to themselves, their suppliers and those using care services. It was encouraging to see how many local authorities are making bold decisions, beginning to focus on enabling care, rather than seeing themselves as being the sole care owner.</p> <p><em>Tony Pilkington has worked in social care for 28 years, and is now managing director of <a href=\"http://www.younifi.co.uk/\">Younifi</a>.</em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/social-care/\">Join the Social Care Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

  "<p>Indigenous leaders have cautiously welcomed plans for a fresh inquiry into the high rates of Indigenous incarceration, providing it delivers tangible changes in government policy.</p> <p>George Brandis, the attorney general, announced on Thursday that he would ask the Australian Law Reform Commission to investigate the issue, saying the overrepresentation of Indigenous people in the justice system was a \u201cnational tragedy\u201d and a poor reflection on Australian society.<br></p> <p>In a speech to the Australian Bar Association in Melbourne, Brandis said the doubling of incarceration rates since the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody showed attempts by successive governments to address the issue had failed.</p> <p>\u201cThose statistics of course paint a stark picture \u2013 a picture of failed initiatives and flawed or incomplete reform efforts which, despite the best intentions, often deliver little by way of tangible progress and indeed, as those statistics reveal, we have gone backwards,\u201d Brandis said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

consultation with Indigenous organisations.</p> <p>Western Australian Labor senator Pat Dodson, a Yawuru man who was on the 1988-91 royal commission, said any fresh inquiry would have to be accompanied by real action to combat the cynicism felt by many in the Indigenous community who had seen inquiry after inquiry pass without change.</p> <p>\u201cIn this case at least they\u2019ve done something,\u201d he said. \u201cThe effectiveness of it has yet to be seen, of course.\u201d</p> <p>The inquiry was announced a week after Dodson <a

<p>\u201c[Scullion] may have peered through the window into the morass in front of him and got a bit of a fright,\u201d Dodson told Guardian Australia on Thursday. \u201cI am not confident that there is a real sense of zeal about this.\u201d</p> <p>Rates of Indigenous imprisonment have doubled in the 25 years since the royal commission, from 14% of the prison population in 1991 to 27% in 2015.<br></p> <p>Indigenous adults are 15 times more likely to be jailed than non-Indigenous adults, Indigenous women are 30 times more likely, and Indigenous children are <a

inquiry should include an examination of the extent to which current social policy addresses the underlying causes of disadvantage which contribute to incarceration rates.<br></p> <p>Reforms like scrapping mandatory sentencing laws in WA or paperless arrest laws in the Northern Territory would reduce incarceration, he said, but are outside of federal government control.</p> <p>\u201cThe social

She was the best imaginable mentor: if she felt she had any wisdom to share she was always happy to do so. She was by nature somebody who liked to connect people. Quite apart from anything else she was hilarious \u2013 very, very funny, and excellent fun to be around.<br></p> <p>Anita was very supportive of what I was doing. One of the most tangible things she did as my mentor was to connect me with <a href=\"http://svn.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Social Venture Network</a>, a networking organisation for people who run social enterprises, co-founded by her friend Josh Mailman.<br></p> <p>In 1993, a couple of years after Green &amp; Black\u2019s launched, Anita recommended me for membership so I went to lots of conferences \u2013 in Boston, Zurich and Italy \u2013 and got to rub shoulders and hear the stories of other people who were trying to do the same sort of things that we were. </p> <p>Anita would introduce me to everybody.

I gathered them up from the bathroom but when I presented them to her she told me she\u2019d left them behind on purpose for the staff. That really made me think. We\u2019d just spent five traumatic days and I hadn\u2019t thought about doing something like that. What she really did was show me that you could do good through doing business, which is what I hope Green &amp; Black\u2019s did.<br></p> <p>Anita also showed me the value of mentoring so I have always felt honour-bound to pay that forwards.

  "<p>Double, double toil and trouble! It\u2019s that time of year when green face paint and tall, black pointy hats are de rigueur. Small children will be knocking on doors carrying little plastic cauldrons, which hopefully will be filled with sweets and treats rather than eye of newt and toe of frog.</p> <p>Our modern idea of witches is a complex mix of cultural influences from Shakespeare to The Wizard of Oz and many things in between. Many of these influences are fictional and created purely for entertainment, but only a few centuries ago witches and witchcraft in Europe and America were seen as a real threat. It has been estimated that there <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/apr/19/top10s.witch.persecution\">between 90,000 and 100,000 witch trials</a> were carried out in Europe, Scandinavia and America between 1400 and 1800. Spates of accusations often occurred during times of war, plague or the failure of harvests but there are many other reasons behind these trials and they are often linked to the particular circumstances at a specific location. </p> <p><a href=\"#v=onepage&amp;q=witches%20midwives%20and%20nurses&amp;f=false\">Midwives and nurses</a> sometimes came under suspicion because of their specialised knowledge and success - or failure - in treating those who were sick. These healing roles were traditionally taken on by women who, until around the turn of the nineteenth century, were <a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/themes/practisingmedicine/women\">excluded from formal medical training</a>. However, many still practiced medicine in their homes and villages, and what they had learned came from shared knowledge and trial and error, rather than accepted official sources. A medical education might not have been a great help in any case. In the days before germ theory the causes of sickness and the reasons for recovery were not obvious. Any recoveries could be seen as miraculous ... or the result of witchcraft. </p> <p>Treating sickness and disease pre-germ theory was largely guesswork. All sorts of noxious compounds were administered to ailing individuals, and if they produced any effect on the body, be it vomiting, diarrhoea or sweating, it was seen as a good thing \u2013 and that was the practice of the so-called professionals. It is not hard to see how images of unofficial healers and herbalists (both men and women) stooping over boiling pots of herbs, roots and who-knows-what, could become a template for the image of a witch, especially when many of the concoctions they produced had such unpleasant effects on their patients.</p> <p>Having said that, herbalists and traditional healers should not be dismissed as completely ignorant of the medical benefits of some of the plants and poultices they used. Some of the ingredients associated with traditional healing and witches\u2019 potions have been found to be hugely beneficial to medicine once they have been isolated, tested and modified. Science has enabled us to identify the key components of some plants and test them to determine how and when they should be administered safely and effectively. Chemists have modified the structures of some of the compounds to reduce side-effects, make drugs more potent or lower their toxicity. </p> <p>For example, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000165.htm\">digitalis</a> (from foxgloves), the source of heart drugs that save thousands of lives annually, was first tested and used in a scientific way by <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109785804575\">Dr William Withering</a> in the 1780s. But Withering found out about using foxgloves to treat his patients from \u201cthe wise woman of Shropshire\u201d. Withering was using concoctions from the whole plant rather than isolated compounds, giving hugely variable results because he could not accurately control the doses of the active ingredients. His medication would still have contained many other potentially harmful compounds from the plant. However, Withering\u2019s work was a huge step towards effective trials of drugs and monitoring of their effects, both good and bad. Digitalis is not an isolated case: effective treatments for pain and a few medical conditions have been known, albeit in crude forms, for centuries. </p> <p>Even some of the additions to the witches\u2019 cauldron in Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth have since been shown to have medical benefit. Yews get a mention, and this tree has long been associated with toxicity and poison (its Latin name <em>Taxus</em> is the origin of the word toxic). However, the Pacific Yew tree (<em>Taxus brevifolia</em>) is now the source of the starting materials for the chemotherapy drug <a href=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancers-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/paclitaxel\">taxol</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s also possible that Shakespeare\u2019s \u201ctooth of wolf\u201d may refer to the black spur-like fungus called <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/ergot\">ergot</a> - its German name is Wolfzahn, or wolf\u2019s tooth. The fungus grows as a parasitic infection on rye and other grains and has been used for centuries in midwifery because some of the compounds found within it can induce contractions of the uterus. Derivatives of these compounds are still in use today, but no longer to induce labour. Instead, in appropriate doses, these drugs are used to treat post-partum bleeding.</p> <p>However, ergot is notorious for reasons unconnected with childbirth. Those compounds in the fungus, so useful for stopping bleeding, act as vasoconstrictors. If too high a dose is taken, blood-flow to the extremities can be restricted, producing a tingling sensation that can progress to cause gangrenous fingers and toes. Excess ergot can also produce convulsions and terrifying hallucinations (ergot alkaloids were the starting point for the synthesis of LSD).</p> <p>These two effects of ergot have had notable consequences. In times when food was in short supply, people became less fussy about the quality of the food they were eating and there have been historic cases of large scale consumption of ergot-contaminated flour in bread. <a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=14891\">Whole villages were sent temporarily crazy</a>, or felt their fingers burning and watched them blacken with gangrene. The common name for ergotism (or ergot poisoning) is St Antony\u2019s Fire. Ergot poisoning has even been suggested as the one of the reasons behind the <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/192/4234/21\">Salem witch trials</a>, though others have cast <a href=\"http://history.howstuffworks.com/history-vs-myth/drugged-salem-witchtrial3.htm\">doubts on the theory</a>.</p> <p>There are many other plants that have been linked to witches potions but one of the most significant is belladonna. <a href=\"http://www.thepoisongarden.co.uk/atoz/atropa_belladonna.htm\">Atropa belladonna</a>, or deadly nightshade, is just one plant of the <em>Solanaceae</em> family that contains atropine, an important drug used in medical applications as varied as ophthalmology and treating slow heart rates. Belladonna, or atropine, can also cause hallucinations, difficulties keeping track of time and feelings of dissociation from the ground. Under the influence of belladonna, some of those accused of witchcraft in centuries gone by may have genuinely believed they flew.</p> <p>I have hardly scratched the surface of the development of medicines from herbal remedies, let alone the vast topic of witches and witchcraft - both are fascinating subjects. As with anything, the more you look the more there is to see and the more interesting it becomes. It is well to remember, especially at Hallowe\u2019en, that not everything is as it first appears, so maybe stick to treats for your cauldron - herbs can be a little tricky.</p>",

Consequently, leaders of Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice party, or PiS, are now hoping to tighten Poland\u2019s abortion laws by removing the right for a termination in cases where the foetus has a congenital disorder.</p> <p>Leszczy\u0144ska said: \u201cIt\u2019s sick to consider forcing women to give a birth to a fatally damaged child. What monster would even think of such a thing? Pregnancy and giving birth is hard work, pain, risk \u2013 and they expect us to suffer all these things? Will they congratulate themselves when we are crying and watching our newly born babies die?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI protested, and I\u2019m going to protest in the future. I feel it\u2019s my responsibility. As long as I have the courage to speak, protest and express my anger, I retain my human dignity.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/25/polish-women-step-up-pressure-abortion-restrictions\">Polish women vow to step up pressure over abortion restrictions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, head of the PiS party, said the government wanted to ensure that even pregnancies involving a child \u201ccertain to die, very deformed, still end up in a birth so that the child can be baptised, buried, have a name\u201d. The government would not step back from this aim, he said.</p> <p>Poland already has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a>, with terminations legally permitted only when the life of the foetus is under threat, when there is a grave threat to the health of the mother, and in the instance that the pregnancy arose from rape or incest.</p> <p>Women who have spoken to the Guardian say they are concerned that those with hardline conservative religious views will persist in lobbying the government until the restrictions are pushed through.</p> <p>Agata Piotrowska, 34, a scientist, who took part in the protests this month, said she feared the very real chance that the abortion rules would be implemented. \u201cThe Catholic church helped the government win the elections. And it is using this legislation, among others, to pay its debt. We have a group of religious radicals hijacking the Polish juridical system to make it reflect extremist beliefs. The new law will not decrease the number of abortions, and it will not save any lives. It will only make abortion more costly and more dangerous, and lead a score of women, and possibly doctors, to jail.\u201d</p> <p>The election pitch of PiS was based on Polish nationalism, Catholicism and promises to help poorer Poles. Last year 40% of women backed PiS compared to 38% of the wider population. </p> <p>El\u017cbieta, 42, who lives in Wroclaw, the largest city in western Poland, said that despite campaign promises, anti-abortion proposals risked causing the most harm to those they were pledging to help most.</p> <p>\u201cIt is tolerable enough if you have a good income, as you can take a short trip to Germany or Slovakia and terminate an unwanted pregnancy. But if you are poor, very young, abused and uneducated, you are nothing. The government will force you to give birth to a child conceived in rape, force you to give birth to the severely damaged foetus, they even force you to die,\u201d she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/06/its-about-basic-dignity-six-women-on-protesting-polands-anti-abortion-proposal\">'It's about basic dignity': six women on protesting Poland's anti-abortion proposal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A total ban of the morning-after pill has been proposed by the Polish Federation of Pro-Life Movements, with the support of an MP from a rightwing faction.

The Greens have been upfront and said they would block it.</p> <p>Point three: in their election costings, both the Coalition and Labor booked the savings delivered by a 32.5% tax rate as if it were going to go ahead \u2013 an obvious ploy to make the bottom line look better.</p> <p>Now the revised 19% backpacker bills have passed the lower house and are under consideration in a Senate committee reporting on 7 November. This is the only delay for which Joyce can blame opposition parties and some crossbenchers. </p> <p>In the meantime, growers have noticed serious downturns in applications from backpackers. </p> <p>Which brings us back to Victoria tube station this week.

It weighs another 25g at 168g and it is 6.2mm wider and 10.9mm taller. Compared to the competition, the Pixel XL is about in the middle. The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is 7.7mm thick and weighs 157g, while Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 Plus is 7.3mm thick and weighs 188g.</p> <p>But the biggest difference for all these 5.5in phablets is the width. The Pixel XL is 75.7mm wide, which is a little narrower than the 77.9mm iPhone 7 Plus but much wider than the 72.6mm S7 Edge. Width is the biggest determinator of how easy a phablet will be to use with one hand without special adaptations for one-handed use. Where the iPhone 7 Plus is too wide, the Pixel XL is right on the limit.</p> <p>Its flat edges and relatively small bezels either side of the 5.5in screen make it manageable with a not abnormal handspan of 23cm. But I suggest if you\u2019re interested in buying one, visit a store to see if it\u2019s comfortable to hold for.</p> <p>The Pixel XL is well built, has a good balance in the hand, but is a bit bland in terms of design, with the only flourish the glass panel that covers a third of the back. It makes it a little easier to grip, but splits opinion as to whether it\u2019s attractive. It grew on me after a week.</p> <p>The display is very good.

It\u2019s snappy, launching apps and switching between them without delay; capable of handling anything you might throw at it and is one of the first DayDream-ready smartphones.</p> <p>The larger screen and increased pixel density do not seem to impact the performance of the device, or how hot it got under load. It ran cooler than most other modern high-end smartphones during general use, heating up slightly only when playing graphically intensive games such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/feb/28/real-racing-3\">Real Racing 3</a> and Asphalt 8.</p> <p>One thing that is different is the Pixel XL\u2019s battery life. Using the Pixel XL as my primary device, it lasted 26 hours between charges, managing three hours of app usage and browsing, hundreds of emails and push notifications, a couple of photos, five hours of music over Bluetooth headphones and quite a lot of Dan the Man during my one hour and 20-minute train commute to and from work. It means you\u2019ll get through a day, a night out and the commute to work the next day, but you\u2019ll have to charge it when you get there.</p> <p>More conservative use and with the battery saving mode enabled below 20% charge will probably see most people at make it till they get home on the second day before needing a charge.</p> <p>When it comes to charging the Pixel XL, zero to 100% takes about one hour 45 minutes.

The ability to have two apps side-by-side on one screen, called multi-window, is one such example. For apps that support it, holding the overview button places one app above the other, or side-by-side in landscape orientation, with a slider in the middle to change the split. It\u2019s particularly useful if you\u2019re having a conversation over text and need to look at a map or similar, and is much more useable on the larger 5.5in screen than the 5in Pixel.</p> <p>On the whole it is the most polished and together Android experience currently available and will benefit from prompt software updates direct from Google that are not blocked or delayed by network providers for at least two years.

It\u2019s a 12.3-megapixel camera with a f/2.0 lens without optical image stabilisation. The iPhone 7\u2019s camera has 12-megapixel camera and an f/1.8 lens, while Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S7 Edge has a 12-megapixel camera with an f/1.7 lens. The lower the f-number the faster the lens and, in theory, the more light it lets in.</p> <p>But the Pixel has a software advantage, producing some of the best, most detailed and colourful photos available. Google\u2019s HDR+ feature is particularly good, producing some of the best high dynamic range photos I\u2019ve seen and without the image blur that can creep in with other systems.</p> <p>It\u2019s low-light performance is also excellent, while the Google Camera app does a great job of balancing features with simplicity at a touch of button. It lacks full manual control, however.</p> <p>The 8-megapixel selfie camera is also very good, producing images with good depth and colour, and a good balance of soft focus and detail.</p> <h2>Observations</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43e456fde3e06055fc194ec85ce9858ef4da07f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43e456fde3e06055fc194ec85ce9858ef4da07f9/0_0_4449_2670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"google pixel xl review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The headphone socket soldiers on.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li>Audio quality through the headphones socket was good but not exceptional</li> <li>The Bluetooth broadcast strength to a set of headphones was stronger and less susceptible to interference than most other smartphones I have tested </li> <li>It only has one down-firing speaker on the bottom, which is easily blocked by hands when gaming, although slightly less so than the 5in Pixel simply because the Pixel XL is wider</li> <li>A notification LED is available, but not enabled by default</li> <li>Gif search is built into Google\u2019s Keyboard for apps that support it such as SMS Messenger app</li> <li>Google Photos on the Pixel comes with free, unlimited full resolution photo and video backup, not just up to 16MP and 1080p video</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"339fbcd9956176b950844ac7393ab31e6ee46750\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/339fbcd9956176b950844ac7393ab31e6ee46750/0_0_4451_2671/1000.jpg\" alt=\"google pixel xl review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The wedge shape means there\u2019s no ugly camera lump on the back.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Price</h2> <p>The Pixel XL costs \u00a3719 with 32GB of storage or \u00a3819 with 128GB of storage in black or silver.

It\u2019s camera is great, it\u2019s snappy, has the latest version of Android and will get updates first, it\u2019s powerful and lasts over a day between charges. Despite its size it\u2019s also relatively easy to use one-handed and it\u2019s well made.</p> <p>The problem is it isn\u2019t exceptional, it isn\u2019t waterproof and it is expensive. It commands top dollar, but unlike competitors such as Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S7 Edge does not provide much in the way of hardware innovation.</p> <p>If I had to pick between the Pixel and Pixel XL, I think the XL is a better phone all round.

But the \u201cacharya\u201d \u2013 or guru, Yogendra\u2019s formal title \u2013 insists the aims of gau raksha are pure. </p> <p>He agreed to take the Guardian out on patrol with his men, granting rare access inside the world of Hindu extremists; where holy men wield weapons, and youths nightly risk death to protect \u201cmother cow\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we travel at night we keep weapons. We also shoot and have killed some smugglers and the smugglers also fire at us. </p> <p>\u201cWe have lost five of our volunteers,\u201d he said. </p> <p>***</p> <p>At about 10pm Sardeep waits outside a school in Panipat along a dusty freeway, under a banner reading: \u201cThose who love cow and country are all welcome.\u201d</p> <p>Just that morning, the 29-year-old \u2013 wearing a polo shirt depicting a cow flanked by daggers and AK-47s \u2013 had helped catch three smugglers and rescue 13 bulls from the slaughterhouse. Hours later, he is still glowing with elation, boasting he felt no fear. \u201cI have called cow my mother,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy should I be afraid?\u201d<br></p> <p>The school principal\u2019s office, the headquarters for the night\u2019s patrol, is ringed with paintings of Hindu saints and holy men, two of the portraits conspicuously newer. A patrol one night in May 2013 confronted armed smugglers, Sardeep explains, and the men depicted in the fresh paintings were both killed.</p> <p>The office steadily fills with other youths, one of them with a deep scar across his nose and forehead. He runs a hand along the length of his arm: that was the size of the sword wielded by the smuggler who slashed his face, he says. Another volunteer clutches a small grey case that he opens briefly, giving a glimpse of a black revolver.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f01d1c4b8e5d3ca49b64186f71c082a63dd29e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f01d1c4b8e5d3ca49b64186f71c082a63dd29e5/0_97_2954_1773/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A revolver is shown as a patrol sets out to discover if any cows are being illegally transported.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A revolver is shown as a patrol sets out to discover if any cows are being illegally transported.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Safi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Outside, a convoy of about three dozen vigilantes are preparing to leave for the evening\u2019s patrol, and the excitement inside the cramped, humid office is palpable: the men say they have received a tip that a smuggling operation is underway.</p> <p>The reverence these men, and most Hindus, feel for cows is indeed ancient. The animal is honoured as a selfless nourisher, and the embodiment of the Hindu principle of non-violence. But the zeal to \u201csave\u201d cows is a modern phenomenon, and masks a more complicated relationship.</p> <p>Many Hindus in Kerala and Tamil Nadu eat beef; so do members of less-powerful castes in need of a cheap source of protein. India is also the world\u2019s largest beef exporter \u2013 though most of what it sends abroad is actually buffalo meat.</p> <p></p> <p>Protecting the docile cows that lumber through Indian traffic has, since the late 1900s, become a stand-in for something larger, says Neera Chandhoke, a <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/neera-chandhoke/\">columnist and retired professor</a> of Indian politics.</p> <p>At first, \u201ca sharp backlash\u201d by Hindus to British colonial rule, \u201cwanting to protect their religion and culture from the alien colonial gaze\u201d, she says. And now, \u201cobviously aimed at the Muslim community\u201d.</p> <p>***</p> <p>It is past 11pm when the patrol finally sets out in a convoy of four-wheel-drives. Up front is Yogendra, the bearish, 35-year-old leader of the Haryana vigilantes, looking every part the holy man in a beard and white robes.</p> <p>\u201cIn our beliefs, it says the cow is the mother of the whole world,\u201d he says from the front seat. \u201cEvery country and every state should believe in it.\u201d</p> <p>Yogendra says he was persuaded to join the fight against cow smuggling 14 years ago, on the advice of his guru; now he heads a vigilante force 5,000-strong. </p> <p>The men are all daily wage labourers, left behind by India\u2019s surging, but uneven economic growth. Those patrolling tonight are also young. <br></p> <p>\u201cI try to motivate more youth than middle-aged men,\u201d he says. \u201c[The older men] are more into reasoning and they argue, so it wastes more time. But youth, we just need to tell them that cow is our mother and we need to protect her. So, it\u2019s easy to motivate a youth.\u201d</p> <p>He passes around his phone, playing a gruesome video of a cow being slaughtered, in obvious agony, and another of a live rabbit being hacked apart with a butcher\u2019s knife. </p> <p>\u201cIn regular intervals we motivate the boys,\u201d he says. \u201cWe show them videos of how a cow, who is our mother, is tortured. We motivate them emotionally.\u201d</p> <p>Smugglers often fight back, throwing stones, sand or chilli powder, he says. Some carry weapons. Five of his volunteers have been killed, and the families of the men sometimes ask their sons to leave the vigilante group. \u201cBut these boys tell their family to understand the cause and support them,\u201d he says. </p> <p>\u201cEven if they don\u2019t, the boys work for us anyway.\u201d<br></p> <p>We pull up at a series of archways along National Highway 1 at Panipat, where trucks line up to pay a toll, and the men surge out in a horde towards the headlights.</p> <p>They slam the sides of the trucks to rouse any sleeping cows, sniff between the crevices for dung, and scale the vehicles to inspect what\u2019s inside. It is unorganised and revelrous, driven by a mob energy, and another guru on the patrol admits the men can be hard to control. Accused smugglers have been killed and beaten before they can be handed to authorities.</p> <p>\u201cWe keep repeating how they have to behave,\u201d the guru says. \u201c[It is] difficult to stop these boys when they find something suspicious.\u201d</p> <p>A police car pulls up and the officers watch warily. \u201cCorrupt,\u201d one of the men pronounces, gesturing at the vehicle. </p> <p>Haryana police have been alternately accused of helping gau raksha groups and taking bribes from smugglers. Bharti Arora, the officer in charge of stopping cow smuggling in the state, denies both charges. She says the gau raksha \u2013 soon to be officially registered and licensed in Haryana \u2013 are permitted to \u201cgive us information\u201d, but have been warned to quit their vigilantism.</p> <p>\u201cPolice do not give much support,\u201d Yogendra says. Several members of the group claim they have been beaten by corrupt officers. They show me a video of one officer, who they say was caught riding with smugglers, begging the incensed gau raksha for forgiveness.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe abroad the police work with discipline, but here, if we need their help at night, they first look for a subordinate,\u201d Yogendra says. \u201cOr they need to look for their car keys, and by that time the smugglers get the opportunity to run.\u201d</p> <p>But at the highest levels of the Indian government, cow protection is firmly on the agenda. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, was elected in 2014 promising to end the \u201cpink revolution\u201d: a supposed ramping up of the meat industry and indifference to cattle smuggling and slaughter.</p> <p>In office, Modi and his Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) have championed a muscular Hinduism \u2013 that critics say sidelines India\u2019s ethnic and religious minorities \u2013 and BJP-led states have toughened jail sentences for cow trafficking and slaughter.</p> <p>Modi likely sees the vigilantes as \u201cirritants\u201d, says Swapan Dasgupta, an Indian journalist and MP. But the presence of an ardent Hindu nationalist in power has energised extremists across the country, \u201cand there are people who are capitalising on it\u201d, he says.</p> <p>As the reports of deaths and injuries from gau raksha violence grew throughout this year, Modi said little until August when, after weeks of protests by Dalits, he condemned \u201c<a href=\"http://www.telegraphindia.com/1160806/jsp/frontpage/story_100975.jsp\">anti-social elements</a>\u201d among the vigilantes.<br></p> <p>Activists are now pushing for the cow to be installed as India\u2019s national animal, and the government is probing the possibility of housing <a href=\"http://www.livemint.com/Politics/OHxkPu1zUSqnodflxSi3PJ/Govt-considers-building-shelters-for-all-stray-cattle-moves.html\">all stray cattle</a> in the country in \u201cgaushala\u201d, or cow shelters.</p> <p>The Guardian visited one of these shelters the day before joining Yogendra on patrol. Based in a quiet village called Nizampur, among grassy fields and ponds, the Jai Shree Shyam Gaushala was a world away from the exhaust-choked freeways where the vigilantes spend their nights.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e4e5656224be79c0f1ffa5a67c483cff9766f51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e4e5656224be79c0f1ffa5a67c483cff9766f51/0_98_2954_1773/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two workers at a gaushala, where strays cows are given homes and attended to for life.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two workers at a gaushala, where strays cows are given homes and attended to for life.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Safi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Inside muddy pens on the property lived thousands of cows and bulls, deemed surfeit to surrounding farms, and which in the recent past might have been sold for slaughter. Here, they were be tenderly cared for until their natural deaths.</p> <p>\u201cSince I was a child I wanted to take care of cows,\u201d said Ajmer Singh, the shelter\u2019s operator.</p> <p>He decided to start the gaushala after the birth of his last child, and first son, Amar, whose first word was \u201ccow\u201d. </p> <p>Singh too goes on patrol with the local gau raksha, but agreed with Modi there were anti-social elements \u201cwho are trying to spread violence in the name of cow protection\u201d.</p> <p>Still, he said, illegal butchering in Haryana\u2019s Muslim villages was a big problem. He was adamant about the punishment for anyone caught. \u201cThey should be killed immediately,\u201d he said.</p> <p>***</p> <p>In Panipat, nearly two hours of combing vehicles has turned up nothing, and the vigilantes are growing listless. They stand by the side of the road jostling, or play with their phones, and suddenly look more like schoolboys on a lark than hardened religious zealots.</p> <p>Then a great shout goes up. Two vigilantes across the freeway signal for the others to join them. They\u2019ve scaled an ageing red truck covered in rope and a tarpaulin, and can see cattle tied up inside.</p> <p>The men surround the vehicle and go to grab the driver, who fumbles to show them sheets of paper. The adrenaline ebbs: the cattle are being transported legally, and the men have to let the driver go. </p> <p>After two more stops that night, both fruitless, the patrol finishes at a farmhouse along a smugglers\u2019 route deep in Haryana\u2019s hinterland. </p> <p>It is time to leave; but first, the men join Yogendra at a table. A crowd forms around us as he delivers a brief sermon. He gestures for the final ritual of our patrol, and one of the men disappears into the farmhouse, emerging with a tray, offering around glasses of fresh milk.</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>Two years ago, when the UK had a future in the European Union and Ed Miliband was a potential prime minister, the chief business commentator of the Financial Times, John Gapper, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b6e43e54-f8a3-11e3-befc-00144feabdc0\">announced the demise</a> of Britain\u2019s rightwing tabloids. Unusually for an FT journalist, Gapper had once worked at the Daily Mail, and at the FT he often writes about the media, sweepingly and authoritatively even by that paper\u2019s standards. \u201cThe era of the Fleet Street tabloids, the populist and fearsome emblems of British culture and politics, is over,\u201d he wrote on 25 June 2014. \u201cIt has been over for some years, in fact, but neither they nor their critics chose to admit it.\u201d</p> <p>He pointed to their shrunken print circulations: in 1950 the Daily Express was \u201cthe world\u2019s best-selling paper\u201d, he wrote, and \u201csold more than 4m copies each day\u201d. Yet by 2014 it was selling barely a ninth of that; and it has weakened further since. \u201cThe tabloids appeal to a readership limited by class, occupation, and social attitude,\u201d Gapper continued. \u201cThat is not sufficient in the digital era. Young people are not loyal to one tabloid title and few of them will subscribe online.\u201d</p> <p>Gapper cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/phone-hacking\">the phone-hacking scandal</a> which closed the News of the World in 2011; competition from politically neutral, free tabloids such as Metro; the distraction of readers by smartphones; and the advancing years of key tabloid figures such as Paul Dacre, now 67, who has been the crusading, splenetic editor of the Mail for almost a quarter of a century. Gapper predicted that Dacre would probably be the last tabloid editor to successfully \u201cexpress their readers\u2019 inner thoughts and emotions \u2026 more strongly than the readers could themselves\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/nov/14/revenge-of-the-tabloids-podcast\">Revenge of the tabloids \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In recent years, the many observers and enemies of the tabloids have repeatedly forecast their political decline. In 2010, the blogger Sunny Hundal wrote in the New Statesman that that year\u2019s general election had been \u201cnotable for how little impact the tabloids had\u201d. He concluded, \u201cIt\u2019s highly unlikely the Sun can claim victory after an election ever again.\u201d This June, in the middle of the EU referendum campaign, the i newspaper declared on its front page, \u201cThe Media Won\u2019t Decide This Vote\u201d. In August, a former managing editor of the Sun, Stig Abell, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/11/opinion/britains-paper-tigers.html?_r=0\">wrote in the New York Times</a> that the other tabloids had become \u201cliving relics\u201d, with the Express \u201cno more than an incontinent shriek of made-up facts about health and immigration\u201d. The headline for the piece was \u201cBritain\u2019s Paper Tigers\u201d.</p> <p>Yet on 23 June 2016, almost two years to the day after Gapper had written their obituary, one of the biggest, oldest dreams of the tabloids came spectacularly to life, when Britain voted to leave the EU, against the predictions of most broadsheet commentators. It was an outcome for which the tabloids had campaigned doggedly for decades, but never more intensely \u2013 or with less factual scrupulousness \u2013 than this spring and summer, when the front pages of the Sun, Mail and Express bellowed for Brexit, talking up Britain\u2019s prospects afterwards, in deafening unison, day after day. Two days before the referendum, the Sun gave over its first 10 pages to pro-Brexit coverage.</p> <p>The referendum has not been the only tabloid triumph of the last 18 months. At the 2015 general election, again contrary to most predictions, the Conservatives won a majority against the Labour bogeyman the papers had alternately mocked and feared for the previous five years: \u201cRed\u201d or \u201cWeird\u201d Ed Miliband. At Loughborough University, Prof David Deacon and his colleagues have studied the tabloid coverage of the last six general elections, going back to 1992. \u201cWe were doing our initial analysis of 2015 while the campaign was going on,\u201d he remembers, \u201cand there seemed to be laughably extreme anti-Labour headlines. The levels of partisanship were at least the equal of what we recorded in 1992,\u201d widely considered the previous high point \u2013 or low point \u2013 of tabloid electoral influence.</p> <p>\u201cOn polling day in 2015,\u201d Deacon continues, \u201cI was doing the final data runs, and I thought to myself, \u2018If Miliband gets a hung parliament, in spite of this hostility, it will be extraordinary. This election will put us out of business.\u2019\u201d He pauses. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/28/when-tabloids-publish-and-dont-give-a-damn\">When tabloids publish and don\u2019t give a damn | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finally, this July, Theresa May suddenly swept past the favourite Boris Johnson to become Conservative leader and unelected prime minister. The Mail has long admired and promoted her as a stern, controlling figure, like Dacre himself. To his usually formal paper, which was thrilled by her fierce party conference speech this month, she is \u201cTheresa\u201d.</p> <p>British politics now feels relentlessly tabloid-dominated. From the daily obsession with immigrants to the rubbishing of human rights lawyers, from the march towards a \u201chard Brexit\u201d to the smearing of liberal Britons as bad losers and elitists, the tabloids and the Conservative right are collaborating with a closeness and a swagger not seen since at least the early 90s.</p> <p>\u201cThe Sun and Mail have more power now than they have for a long time,\u201d says David Yelland, editor of the Sun from 1998 to 2003. \u201cYou could argue that in Brexit the tabloids had their most powerful moment ever.\u201d In a text less than an hour after the Brexit victory was declared, the current editor of the Sun, Tony Gallagher, told the Guardian\u2019s media editor: \u201cSo much for the waning power of the print media.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Even the most confident and successful<strong> </strong>modern British politicians have regarded the tabloids as culturally and electorally pivotal. In 2012, Tony Blair told the Leveson inquiry into the behaviour of the British press: \u201cIf you have a readership of three to four million \u2026 that\u2019s power \u2026 I don\u2019t know any other way of describing it.\u201d In his autobiography, Blair writes of his decision as Labour leader to appease the Sun and its proprietor Rupert Murdoch: \u201cNot to [do so] was to say carry on and do your worst, and we knew their worst was very bad indeed.\u201d</p> <p>Like almost every book about New Labour, Blair\u2019s has dozens of index entries for the Sun and Mail. Conservatives tend to be more reticent about their relations with the tabloids: there are no index references to the Sun in either volume of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s memoirs. But shortly before her 1987 general election victory, she spoke privately about Murdoch to her confidant Woodrow Wyatt. \u201cWe depend on him to fight for us,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Sun is marvellous.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3094b0b1a09238e686b6edd408dc7f77f4dddd3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3094b0b1a09238e686b6edd408dc7f77f4dddd3e/125_79_3201_4358/735.jpg\" alt=\"The Daily Mail has long admired Theresa May\" width=\"735\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Daily Mail has long admired Theresa May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daily Mail</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/06/08/general-election-2015-how-britain-really-voted/\">research by YouGov</a>, the paper you read is still \u201ca far better predictor of Labour and Tory support than any other indicator\u201d. This applies to all national papers \u2013 in 2015, Guardian readers chose Labour over the Tories by 10 to one. But with the rightwing tabloids, uniquely, the link is rapidly growing stronger. At the 2015 general election, the Tory advantage over Labour among Sun readers was one-and-a-half times as big as it had been in 2010. Moreover, as John Curtice of Strathclyde University, the veteran analyst of British voting behaviour, points out: \u201cPeople who still read papers in print are disproportionately politically interested. They vote!\u201d</p> <p>The word \u201ctabloid\u201d was invented in 1884 by the pharmaceutical magnate Henry Wellcome; before it referred to pithy newspapers, it meant a concentrated dose of medicine.</p> <p>Consider some headlines from the Express this autumn: \u201cMigrant Influx Is Threatening To Destroy Our Way Of Life\u201d; \u201cMuslim Bus Driver \u2018Put Children\u2019s Lives At Risk\u2019 By Stopping For Prayer\u201d; \u201cBenefit Cheats Spared Jail As Fraud Rockets\u201d. For the rightwing tabloids, they are unremarkable \u2013 such themes and stereotypes and phrases have run through the papers for decades: on front pages, in news stories, in features, editorials and pieces by columnists, almost all the articles agreeing with each other, almost every day. The papers have tirelessly devoted themselves to what the Italian political theorist Antonio Gramsci referred to as the manufacturing of \u201ccommon sense\u201d, by which he meant the partisan but often unnoticed and unchallenged assumptions that tilt public opinion rightwards. In 2013, an in-depth survey by <a href=\"https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3188/Perceptions-are-not-reality-the-top-10-we-get-wrong.aspx\">Ipsos MORI revealed</a> that Britons vastly overestimate the number of British immigrants, Muslims and benefit fraudsters.</p> <p>In an era when agreed facts are becoming rarer, and voters are increasingly impatient and distracted, but also disorientated by shock events, influencing how issues are talked about is more important than ever \u2013 possibly more important, in fact, than influencing elections. In Britain, uniquely among democracies, a few tabloid newspapers are at the heart of both; their preoccupations so familiar that the terms \u201ctabloid\u201d and \u201crightwing tabloid\u201d have become almost synonymous.</p> <p>Yet the exact workings and nature of their influence are fiercely disputed. Politicians, journalists, academics, and tabloid proprietors say contradictory things about it. Defenders of the papers say that tabloids understand and represent their readers; critics say that they talk down to them and manipulate them. Even the owners of tabloids can\u2019t always keep their story straight. In 2012, Murdoch told the Leveson inquiry that the Sun\u2019s famous claim after the 1992 election \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s The Sun Wot Won it\u201d \u2013 had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/apr/25/rupert-murdoch-sun-wot-won-it-tasteless\">\u201ctasteless and wrong \u2026 We don\u2019t have that sort of power.\u201d</a> But at the Sun\u2019s offices in London, some of the rooms have glass walls with reproductions of its most mythologised headlines embedded in them, including the front page from the day of the 1992 election, about the then Labour leader, Neil Kinnock: \u201cIf Kinnock wins today will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights.\u201d</p> <p>Like Miliband, Kinnock unexpectedly lost. Murdoch told the Leveson inquiry he thought this front page was \u201cabsolutely brilliant\u201d. He could not resist revelling in his paper\u2019s power, it seemed, even as he denied it.</p> <p>In 1992, the political scientist Ken Newton wrote that identifying the political role of newspapers was \u201ca classic conundrum of the behavioural sciences\u201d. Do people think and vote as rightwingers because they read rightwing papers \u2013 or is it the other way around? Are tabloids just one voice in a larger media babble, or do they play a unique role in setting the agenda for other journalists, such as broadcasters? To what extent do the tabloids shape their readers\u2019 social values \u2013 or have the tabloids\u2019 own values been made to shift by changing public attitudes towards race and gender and sexuality?</p> <p>In the Britain of Theresa\u2019s Brexit and seemingly perpetual Tory government, the rightwing tabloids reign again \u2013 even as their business, like the rest of the print media, continues to crumble. Is theirs a brittle supremacy? Or is their hold on the national discourse secure for another generation?</p> <p>One way to investigate these questions is to tell the story of their political influence on modern Britain. It is not a simple tabloid tale.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Britain is in many ways a perfect environment for a partisan press. It is a small, centralised country with a raucous party politics and an enduring culture of national newspapers. Unlike local papers, the nationals do not have to appeal to everyone, but can have intense relationships with particular readerships. British newspapers first appeared regularly during the civil war of the 1640s: the earnest Mercurius Britannicus supported parliament, the mocking Mercurius Aulicus backed the royalists. Three hundred years on, political bias remained so blatant that in 1947 Clement Attlee\u2019s Labour government established a royal commission to investigate the press, in particular the power of its disproportionate number of rightwing proprietors. Lord Beaverbrook, the domineering owner of the Express, told the ineffectual commission: \u201cMy purpose originally was to set up a propaganda paper, and I have never departed from that.\u201d</p> <p>Two years later, the pioneering social research organisation Mass Observation conducted one of the first British studies of the interactions between newspapers and their readers, by scrutinising press consumption in libraries and other public places. \u201cMost people choose their paper primarily for its politics,\u201d it found. Fifty-eight per cent of people read political news stories, far more than read sport or \u201cgossip\u201d. With huge electoral turnouts and party memberships, Attlee\u2019s Britain was a highly politicised society. \u201cNewspaper influence on [reader] opinion,\u201d the study went on, was \u201ca subtle, almost imperceptible process\u201d: either \u201cthe long-term reinforcement of opinions already held\u201d, or to \u201csow seeds and implant suggestions on points to which people have up to now given next to no thought\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aef06dcd98537d709e418dee36c26edd1aa25b42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aef06dcd98537d709e418dee36c26edd1aa25b42/0_0_3259_4164/783.jpg\" alt=\"The Daily Express has run a steam of anti-migrant front pages.\" width=\"783\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Daily Express has run a steam of anti-migrant front pages.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Express Newspapers/Daily Express</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Mass Observation warned over\u2011ideological proprietors: \u201cPeople tend to resist newspaper influences that lead them in a direction they are not disposed to follow.\u201d During the 1945 general election, one Express headline read, \u201cGestapo In Britain if Socialists Win\u201d. Attlee won by a landslide.</p> <p>So used to thinking of tabloids as always omnipotent, modern Britain has forgotten that their political influence actually dwindled during the postwar decades. Improving literacy and the complexities of the war reduced the impact of simplistic newspapers. Mass Observation found the press falling behind \u201cbooks\u201d, \u201cpersonal experience\u201d, and \u201cfriends and family\u201d as political influences. The arrival of television during the 50s, which was not allowed to be partisan, made the Mail and the Express, founded in 1896 and 1900 respectively, look still more like bombastic Victorian throwbacks. So did the increasingly consensual nature of postwar party politics.</p> <p>In 1952, the Labour politician and diarist Richard Crossman spent a hospital stay reading a British newspaper history: \u201cWhat struck me,\u201d he wrote afterwards, \u201cwas the enormous power of the press in politics before 1918 and its steady decline since... Today, [when there is] a campaign against a cabinet minister, the effect is usually to strengthen his position.\u201d</p> <p>As the economy recovered from the war, advertising revenue became more important to papers, and this brought a pressure to publish fewer political, potentially reader-alienating stories. According to the media historians James Curran and Jean Seaton, the amount of \u201cpublic affairs\u201d coverage in the tabloids halved between 1945 and 1975. The Mail and Express carried on backing the Conservatives, but their readers increasingly ignored the editorials: by 1963, 28% of Mail readers and 38% of Express readers supported Labour.</p> <p>In 1964, the struggling Daily Herald, founded half a century earlier as a radical paper for striking trade unionists, was relaunched as the Sun. It remained Labour-supporting;<strong> </strong>but as its apolitical-sounding, blandly uplifting name might suggest, it was more interested in consumerism, and in what it called \u201cpacesetters\u201d: young working-class people, often women, who were joining the expanding middle class of southern England.</p> <p>The idea that newspapers should no longer lecture their readers received support from academia. The Sun was conceived partly on the advice of a sociologist and social forecaster, Dr Mark Abrams. He produced reports with graphs and tables which appeared to prove the existence of a new, increasingly well-educated, less politically tribal, mass newspaper readership. Meanwhile in America, where most academic work on the media was done, the analysis of press influence converged on a \u201cminimal effects model\u201d. It noted that few voters changed their minds during presidential races, when coverage of politics was at its most feverish, and concluded that papers were not much of a factor in electoral contests.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a12941e044bc5f936f928e83dc0d5d4bab4bc7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a12941e044bc5f936f928e83dc0d5d4bab4bc7f/0_0_1036_1351/767.jpg\" alt=\"Rupert Murdoch told the Leveson inquiry that this Sun front page was \u2018tasteless and wrong\u2019.\" width=\"767\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rupert Murdoch told the Leveson inquiry that this Sun front page was \u2018tasteless and wrong\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GNM/NI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like many postwar American ideas, \u201cminimal effects\u201d quickly crossed the Atlantic, and helped shape the thinking of the small number of British media analysts. In 1974, the respected Colin Seymour-Ure wrote languidly in his book The Political Impact of Mass Media: \u201cMost British national newspapers ... are \u2018partisan\u2019 in only a loose sense.\u201d Beaverbrook had died in 1964. The equally rightwing co-creators of the Mail, Viscount Northcliffe and Viscount Rothermere, had died in 1922 and 1940, respectively. Newspapers were increasingly controlled by corporations seeking profits or prestige rather than political clout. In a 1977 essay titled \u201cThe Organization of Public Opinion\u201d, the media academic Tom Burns concluded: \u201cThe power of the press barons has gone.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>It had not. In 1969 Murdoch bought his first British paper, the News of the World. While mostly interested in sex and scandals, it was traditionally a Tory paper. According to Roy Greenslade\u2019s reliable 2003 book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/18/society1\">Press Gang: How Newspapers Make Profits from Propaganda</a>, Murdoch was permitted to acquire it partly because the other potential buyer was Robert Maxwell, then a book publisher and Labour MP.</p> <p>Murdoch\u2019s own politics, at this stage, were a slightly unformed but usefully ambiguous mix, both pro-business and pro-trade union. Despite the elite-bashing persona which he would deploy, brilliantly and shamelessly, in the intensely class-sensitive world of British newspapers for decades to come, he was in fact the son of an Australian press magnate, Sir Keith Murdoch. Sir Keith had been so influenced by the Mail\u2019s Northcliffe that he was nicknamed Lord Southcliffe. When Murdoch junior was asked if he would tell the News of the World what to say, he replied: \u201cI did not come all this way not to interfere.\u201d</p> <p>When the Sun was also put up for sale in 1969, after its first incarnation attracted too few readers, Murdoch and Maxwell again competed to buy it. Maxwell wanted to slim the Sun\u2019s staff, while Murdoch assured the paper\u2019s powerful unions that he had no such intentions. Again, Murdoch won. His Sun tried to be youthfully, fashionably left-liberal: it was against the death penalty, nuclear weapons and the Vietnam war; for Labour and personal freedom. Its endorsement of the party at the 1970 general election deferred to readers rather than tried to browbeat them: \u201cThis \u2026 far-from-perfect Labour government has just about earned the right to \u2026 another term of office. That is our view. But you have a mind of your own.\u201d</p> <p>During the late 60s and early 70s, the large advantage that the Conservatives had always enjoyed among the tabloids, in terms of both circulation and opinions expressed, suddenly evaporated. When the national union of mineworkers (NUM) went on strike in 1972 against Edward Heath\u2019s Tory government, the Express, despite still being owned by the Beaverbrook family, was sympathetic: \u201cThese men do a hard, dirty, dangerous job \u2026 All they ask is a decent wage. They should have it.\u201d The Mail acknowledged \u201cwidespread public support\u201d for the strike, and commented: \u201cSympathy for the miners is a good cause. It makes sense for Britain.\u201d The editor of the Sun, Larry Lamb, was the son of an NUM official and had once edited a union journal. Of the Sun\u2019s pro-strike coverage, Murdoch said afterwards, \u201cWe certainly pushed public opinion very hard behind the miners.\u201d</p> <p>Just as startling and forgotten, in Britain\u2019s first referendum on EU membership, in 1975, the tabloids urged their readers to vote in favour of Europe. When the pro-EU side won by 67% to 33%, the Mail rejoiced: \u201cThis is the most crushing victory in British political history. The effects of this thunderous YES will echo down the years.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54b44b4916709999db45cefad43a9a877459f631\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54b44b4916709999db45cefad43a9a877459f631/0_0_4096_3302/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rupert Murdoch inspects one of the first copies of the Sun in 1969\" width=\"1000\" height=\"806\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rupert Murdoch inspects one of the first copies of the Sun in 1969.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA/PA Archive/Press Association Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the tabloids\u2019 flirtation with cosmopolitanism and the left was short. In 1974, the miners went on strike against Heath again, and the Mail condemned them. When he called a general election that February, to try to end the dispute, the Sun endorsed the Conservatives. Some of this shift was a reaction against the increasing radicalism of parts of the union movement and the Labour party. The Mail became preoccupied by the presence of communists in the NUM. But the tabloids were also increasingly hit by strikes themselves. The stalling, inflationary British economy of the mid-70s had brought lower advertising revenues, higher newsprint costs, and higher wage demands. All Fleet Street papers had prickly unions, but the Sun\u2019s were the most rebellious of all, regularly stopping editions from appearing.</p> <p>James Alan Anslow joined the Sun in 1977, and worked there on and off for four decades, as well as writing and lecturing in academia about tabloids and their readers. \u201cSoon after I started at the Sun,\u201d he told me, \u201cI was working on production, and I let the word \u2018victory\u2019 through on a headline about a strike by the firemen\u2019s union. Kelvin MacKenzie [who later became the paper\u2019s most aggressively rightwing editor] gave me a bollocking. He said, \u2018Don\u2019t you know what we\u2019re all about?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>After Margaret Thatcher seized the Tory leadership from Heath in 1975, Larry Lamb quickly became a convert. The Sun editor would invite her to his office for evening chats and whisky, and published so many favourable pieces about her that the more cautious Murdoch, anxious about the Sun\u2019s large residue of Labour readers, would phone Lamb and ask, \u201cAre you still pushing that bloody woman?\u201d The Sun had backed the losing side at both the 1970 and February 1974 general elections. But by the late 70s many voters were turning against unions and collectivism, and the individualistic Sun\u2019s circulation surged, doubling over the decade. In 1978, it overtook its once-dominant leftwing rival, the Daily Mirror, to become Britain\u2019s best-selling daily paper. In January 1979, amid the strike chaos of the Winter of Discontent, the Sun lethally punctured the credibility of the Labour prime minister, Jim Callaghan, with a headline that sounded like a quote from him but was actually disguised editorialising: \u201cCrisis, What Crisis?\u201d</p> <p>The Mail was an early and effective Thatcher ally too. Its editor during the 70s and 80s was David English, a zealously rightwing former entrepreneur who had backed her coup against Heath (the Mail was the only paper to do so). English modernised the Mail\u2019s design, and turned the paper into a less fusty, more seductive advocate of Conservative values, presenting them as basic British common sense, somehow above mere party politics. The day before the 1979 general election, the Mail\u2019s front page read, \u201cThe Woman Who Can Save Britain\u201d. The Sun\u2019s endorsement of the Conservatives was less personal and more equivocal, but eye-catching: \u201cVOTE TORY THIS TIME.\u201d The return of the rightwing tabloids was complete \u2013 and with it came the press culture we still live in now.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>As British voters have become more disengaged since the 70s, the tabloids\u2019 political messages have had to become louder. \u201cVOTE FOR MAGGIE,\u201d yelled the Sun\u2019s front page on the day of the 1983 general election. When Labour moved rightwards after losing, choosing the pragmatic Kinnock as leader, the Sun immediately dismissed him regardless: \u201cHe has no intellectual depth, no coherent philosophy.\u201d</p> <p>Kinnock\u2019s strategist Philip Gould, who would become Labour\u2019s key interpreter of voter behaviour during the 90s, began reading the tabloids closely. \u201cI looked at those papers and silently wept,\u201d he wrote after the 1992 general election campaign. Some tabloid journalists had mixed feelings about their papers\u2019 power. James Alan Anslow remembers: \u201cWhen the Sun did the lightbulb\u201d \u2013 its famous 1992 front page of Kinnock\u2019s balding head inside a bulb \u2013 \u201cI was out on the doorstep canvassing for him. Politically, I thought it was awful. Journalistically, I felt \u2026 professional admiration. I couldn\u2019t help smiling. In the office after the paper came out, there was a lot of chatting and smiling. There was a sense of being in amongst it \u2013 of counting.\u201d</p> <p>When Labour lost, despite a tired Conservative government, there was a surge of academic and media interest in the tabloids\u2019 political role. The \u201cminimal effects\u201d model had already begun to attract British doubters. In 1991, the media analyst William Miller had written about what he instead called \u201cthe Basildon effect\u201d. In this heavily working-class Essex constituency, which had one of the highest proportions of Sun readers in the country, a small and supposedly vulnerable Conservative majority had risen rather than fallen at the 1987 election. According to Miller, this swing had happened late in the campaign \u2013 when the Sun\u2019s onslaught on Labour was at its loudest \u2013 and it had been repeated in other similar Tory marginals. He suggested the paper had played a major role.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"51c1fe1b3a9785cb8adaeff8801526fc2f3aa100\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51c1fe1b3a9785cb8adaeff8801526fc2f3aa100/0_0_590_768/384.jpg\" alt=\"The famous 1992 front page of Neil Kinnock\u2019s head inside a bulb.\" width=\"384\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The famous 1992 front page of Neil Kinnock\u2019s head inside a bulb.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GMN/NI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1992, John Curtice interviewed a panel of voters from across the country, before and after the general election. Unlike Miller, he did not find tabloid readers shifting from Labour to the Conservatives. But he wrote that the papers did play a part in \u201cwinning over or maintaining in the Conservative camp electors who might otherwise have abstained or voted Liberal Democrat\u201d. All the scare stories about Labour, it appeared, had persuaded these pivotal voters to choose the Tories as the lesser evil, as they would in 2015.</p> <p>More ominously still for non-Tories, in 1992 Ken Newton found that people with Labour views who read a rightwing paper \u2013 of whom there were still millions \u2013 were more likely to vote Conservative than people with Tory views who read a leftwing one were to vote Labour. Tory papers were better at making converts than Labour ones, in other words, just as they would prove better at turning leftwing readers into Brexiters than the Labour press would be at creating remainers.</p> <p>By the 90s, many political observers assumed that readers of rightwing tabloids were a sort of block vote, to be deployed en masse by proprietors as decisively as union members had been by their leaders during the 70s. In academia and beyond, the tabloid factor was frequently cited as a reason why Labour would never win power again.</p> <p>There were weaknesses in this argument. The gap between the Conservative share of the newspaper market \u2013 between 70 and 80% \u2013 and the Conservative share of the vote at general elections \u2013 around 40% \u2013 suggested that papers were not terribly efficient creators of Tory voters. Even in 1979, when the Sun had said \u201cVOTE TORY\u201d, fewer than half of its readers had done so. Another third actually believed it had endorsed Labour. As Britain became a less deferential, less politicised society, readers could no longer be relied on to absorb or even notice bossy political articles in the way that they had in the editorialists\u2019 heyday of the 40s.</p> <p>Yet by the mid-90s, after four consecutive general election defeats, Labour was not interested in examining such complexities. Under Blair, the party generally sought to accommodate rather than challenge rightwing interests: Gould decided that the Mail was \u201cthe key influencer of Middle Britain\u201d, Blair that Murdoch was \u201cimmensely powerful\u201d. More than a year before Blair became Labour leader in 1994, a delicate political dance began between him and the tabloids \u2013 each side seeking to draw maximum advantage from the rising strength of the other \u2013 which culminated in the Sun endorsing Labour at the 1997 general election.</p> <p>The day before the announcement, Blair\u2019s press secretary Alastair Campbell was contacted by the Sun and told to call its editor, Stuart Higgins. \u201cHe said they were going to come out for us in a big front page tomorrow,\u201d Campbell wrote in his diary, capturing the sense of mutual triumph and machismo. \u201cStuart said Rupert Murdoch was sure [about Blair], and laughed \u2026 I took [Blair] to one side and \u2026 I said you remember in 1994 when I said we should try to get the Sun on board and you said you weren\u2019t sure it was possible, well, they are. He thought it was good news in its own right \u2026 [and] in the effect it would have on the other side\u2019s morale.\u201d The next day, the Today programme on Radio 4 reported that the Conservatives felt bewildered: \u201cOld friends\u201d \u2013 its correspondent meant the Sun \u2013 \u201care passing them by on the other side of the street.\u201d</p> <p>Less noticed was the fact that the paper had endorsed Labour on its own, almost unchanged, rightwing terms. \u201cLike us, Blair recognises that the Tories under Maggie Thatcher achieved remarkable reforms,\u201d said the Sun. \u201cBlair has promised to slay the dragon of Europe,\u201d it went on, and might even \u201ctame\u201d the welfare state. As well as choosing governments, the tabloids now wanted to decide what they did.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In 2004, George Lakoff, a professor of linguistics at Berkeley, published a deceptively breezy political book called Don\u2019t Think of an Elephant! Its central argument was that how issues are \u201cframed\u201d \u2013 which points of view the media and other political tastemakers defined as acceptable, and the language used to do so \u2013 largely decides how voters think about them.</p> <p>For the last two decades, through Labour, coalition and Conservative governments, the tabloids have successfully chosen and then framed most of the debates that have dominated British domestic politics, ensuring that law and order, immigration, the role of the state, and Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe have all been discussed in ever more rightwing terms.</p> <p>The Blair government\u2019s determination to be \u201ctough on crime\u201d; the Brown government\u2019s \u201cBritish jobs for British workers\u201d; the Cameron government\u2019s onslaught on benefits-claiming \u201cshirkers\u201d; the May government\u2019s \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d \u2013 all have been catchphrases, not always with workable policies attached, intended to \u201cplease the tabloids\u201d, in the euphemistic stock phrase of British political punditry.</p> <p>On occasions, the newspapers have directly intervened in the making of government policy. According to Nick Davies\u2019s book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/21/hack-attack-truth-rupert-murdoch-nick-davies-review\">Hack Attack: How the Truth Caught Up with Rupert Murdoch</a>, in 2001 the Sun forced Brown as chancellor to permit more private sector involvement in the NHS. First, the paper condemned his cherished plan to increase NHS spending as too profligate, writes Davies, then a \u201cpanicked\u201d Brown \u2013 desperate not to be portrayed as a traditional tax-and-spend leftwinger \u2013 \u201ccontacted the Sun \u2026 agreed to rearrange his diary so that he could go to their office that day \u2026 [and] sat down with the Sun\u2019s outspoken rightwing political editor, Trevor Kavanagh, for an interview which \u2026 rapidly became a negotiation about policy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0ff0099559541821fd4340b2de64fb6748741e78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ff0099559541821fd4340b2de64fb6748741e78/47_36_1149_1569/732.jpg\" alt=\"The Daily Mail backs Theresa May for prime minister.\" width=\"732\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Daily Mail backs Theresa May for prime minister.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daily Mail</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the meantime, policy ideas that have been popular with the public but not with these papers, and their proprietors \u2013 raising taxes on the wealthy or on property; renationalising loathed and ineffective privatised utilities \u2013 have almost never been enacted.</p> <p>During the Blair era, tabloid circulations, like those of all newspapers, stagnated and then fell. British party politics, fixated on the \u201ccentre ground\u201d, was often as consensual as it had been during the 50s, when the tabloids had felt obliged to tone down their rhetoric. Yet this time they did the opposite, emboldened by the Blair government\u2019s acceptance of their agenda and eagerness to have friendly relations. The tabloids became more influential still.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as the media in general adjusted to a new world of internet competitors, squeezed budgets, and recycled content, the papers became a dependable source of polemic for other outlets. \u201cSky and the BBC are still obsessed by reviewing the papers,\u201d says Charlie Beckett, a former TV executive who is professor of media at the London School of Economics. Presenters holding up tomorrow morning\u2019s front pages to the camera, he points out, \u201cis cheap telly\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The need for broadcasters to be balanced, once seen as a threat, has created a market for tabloid shrillness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yelland says: \u201cThe first thing you do when you\u2019ve put together a front page, is get it over to Sky, to the paper review shows.\u201d Tom Baldwin, Ed Miliband\u2019s press strategist as Labour leader, told me: \u201cThey could say \u2018Black Is White: Exclusive\u2019 on the front of the Mail, and the next day, there\u2019d be a story on the BBC: \u2018Controversy over whether black is white \u2026\u2019\u201d The legal requirement for British broadcasters to be balanced, once considered a threat to the tabloids, has created a new market for their shrillness.</p> <p>It is even possible that the papers\u2019 political stances are even more influential now than in the past, precisely because they are less and less read. Their positions are simply assumed \u2013 rather than widely scrutinised for flaws or contradictions \u2013 and politicians and public opinion adjust accordingly. Gramsci, who died in 1937, would be appalled and fascinated.</p> <p>As the editor of the Sun, says Yelland, \u201cI was very much aware that most people were not reading the political stuff. But the Sun set the mood music of Westminster, of the lobby [journalists], of the morning meetings in every department in Downing Street.\u201d Like any good tabloid journalist, he may be overstating a little, but to manipulate the elite while insisting your journalism is for the masses is certainly quite a trick.</p> <p>While Labour leader, Miliband tried to break out of his party\u2019s suffocating tabloid relationship. Baldwin, who supported the move, remembers: \u201cAt first, we felt we had better keep talking to them, have dinners with the editor of the Sun. Ed would have drinks with Dacre. Then phone-hacking happened \u2026\u201d Miliband reacted to the scandal by attacking the tabloids\u2019 political influence, and calling for them to be properly regulated. \u201cThere weren\u2019t ever drinks with Dacre after that,\u201d says Baldwin. \u201cDacre was screaming down the phone at Ed. It felt liberating, exciting, scary. Gordon Brown said to us, \u2018This is a big thing you\u2019ve done. You\u2019ve got to keep your foot on their neck, or they\u2019ll come back up and smack you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Yet as often with Miliband, his anti-tabloid initiative petered out. \u201cEd\u2019s management style is to balance,\u201d says a former adviser, \u201cand there were some good personal relationships in the Labour team with some tabloid reporters.\u201d Baldwin says: \u201cWe lost the [internal] argument. We got back to business as usual.\u201d At the 2015 election, the tabloids tore into Miliband and Labour regardless.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>During the Cameron governments, it felt like Murdoch and Dacre were the adults, and the politicians were children</p> <footer> <cite>David Yelland</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>David Cameron underwent a similar experience with the papers. At first, as Tory leader \u2013 influenced by his adviser Steve Hilton, who believed that in the digital era the views of newspapers were of increasingly minor relevance \u2013 Cameron decided that rather than \u201csucking up to Murdoch\u201d, as one of his aides put it, it was better to \u201ckeep your distance\u201d from the tabloids, and to focus instead on television appearances. Yet when the effectiveness of Cameron\u2019s leadership was widely criticised in 2007 \u2013 not least by Murdoch\u2019s papers \u2013 he quickly changed his approach. He hired the former News of the World editor Andy Coulson as his director of communications, and maintained a high-profile, highly political friendship with the editor of the Sun and Murdoch favourite, Rebekah Brooks. In 2009, the Sun switched its support from Labour back to the Conservatives.</p> <p>Despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jan/21/andy-coulson-resigns-david-cameron\">Coulson\u2019s resignation over phone-hacking</a> in 2011, and conviction for the same offence in 2014, Cameron\u2019s governments remained tabloid-friendly throughout, straining to come up with populist policies and language.But while the Mail backed the Conservatives as always, Dacre and his paper remained lukewarm towards the metropolitan Cameron. And when Cameron finally challenged the tabloids\u2019 worldview, the EU referendum, they were brutal towards him, and helped terminate his premiership.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"23ee1058c1c337f8d863433588946bd42451e386\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23ee1058c1c337f8d863433588946bd42451e386/24_23_761_981/388.jpg\" alt=\"When Cameron challenged the Sun\u2019s views on Europe he was brutally attacked.\" width=\"388\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When Cameron challenged the Sun\u2019s views on Europe he was brutally attacked.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Sun</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Baldwin says, \u201cI\u2019ve been amused to hear Craig Oliver\u201d, Coulson\u2019s successor as Cameron\u2019s communications director, \u201craging to left-of-centre journos about the rightwing press and how awful they are.\u201d Yelland argues that the tabloid barons are simply \u201cbetter at what they do than the politicians. Murdoch and Dacre have been around for so long, fashioning words and campaigns. During the Cameron governments, it felt like they were the adults, and the politicians were children.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Will the reign of the tabloids ever end?<strong> </strong>It was interrupted when the second world war created a kinder Britain, and again, fleetingly, after the phone-hacking scandal in 2011. Profound social change, or the exposure of journalists\u2019 excesses, can weaken even apparently impregnable tabloid citadels.</p> <p>Over recent decades, shifting public attitudes have undermined some of the papers\u2019 certainties. \u201cWhen I look back at the words I used to use as a Sun sub,\u201d James Alan Anslow remembered, \u201c\u2018the gay plague\u2019, \u2018black gangs\u2019. You\u2019d get sacked if you used those now!\u201d</p> <p>Charlie Beckett detects a hard-nosed rationale behind this softening: \u201cIn a tightening market, you don\u2019t want to put off readers. When you had a circulation of four million, it mattered less if you said something racist, say, and put off 5% of your readers.\u201d Moreover, the tabloids have sometimes received disproportionate credit for their liberal moments. The Mail\u2019s much-praised campaigning for the truth about the racist murder in 1993 of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence sits uneasily with the endless xenophobic nudges of its immigration coverage.</p> <p>The tabloids still look much the same now as they did three decades ago. Redesigns have been much rarer and more cautious than at other papers. So have alterations to the basic tabloid prose style. \u201cYou know what you\u2019re going to get from the first sentence,\u201d says Beckett. \u201cThey haven\u2019t caught the conversational tone of the internet \u2026 their style is very clunky.\u201d David Deacon of Loughborough University says that in his research on election bias he finds that \u201cPeople are far more aware [now] of the narrative games, of tabloid-speak.\u201d The tabloids have always been self-conscious \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s The Sun Wot Won It\u201d \u2013 but nowadays their political rages would be almost camp, if they did not have such consequences. As Baldwin puts it, the papers often read \u201clike a parody of themselves\u201d.</p> <p>Anslow, who is 65, said he sometimes sensed a nostalgia in the air at the Sun\u2019s offices. \u201cIf we do a special front page, people say, \u2018It\u2019s a real classic. It\u2019s just like the old days.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Two years ago, the paper moved from its old premises in east London, an intimidating compound of hulking, almost windowless blocks behind high-security fences, widely known as \u201cFortress Wapping\u201d, to a much blander, more generic office building in central London. Its glass-walled, approachable-feeling lobby faces directly on to the street. Down one side are blown-up photographs from various Murdoch publications. The Sun\u2019s is just a generic showbiz shot, as if the paper\u2019s political coverage is less of a priority nowadays. On the Sun and Mail websites, political stories are much less prominent than in their print editions.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is 14 months into an experiment in ignoring the tabloids. It may well be doomed; but his leadership has already lasted longer than the tabloids expected, and their ceaseless attacks on him, like their shouting down of anyone who doubts Brexit will be a success, have a small undertone of anxiety about them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"00019ddb76e32e5f9e22e148aa42199f851bfbb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00019ddb76e32e5f9e22e148aa42199f851bfbb3/0_0_3153_4055/778.jpg\" alt=\"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn may be ignoring the tabloids but they are not reciprocating.\" width=\"778\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn may be ignoring the tabloids but they are not reciprocating.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Twenty-four years ago, the British political scientist Ken Newton pondered the multilayered puzzle of how newspapers and their readers relate politically, and produced perhaps the closest thing to an answer. \u201cThe press and its readers are likely to be mutually dependent,\u201d he wrote, \u201cinfluencing each other in a constantly shifting process of mutual adaptation.\u201d The tabloids may have adapted \u2013 a little \u2013 to their readers\u2019 changing attitudes, but the papers retain an old-fashioned suspicion of new kinds of Briton, and a nastiness towards people who do not fit their rigid worldviews. Above all, the tabloids remain stubbornly attached to the optimistic free-market ideas of the one prime minister that they have never turned against, Margaret Thatcher \u2013 an optimism that many of their readers have not felt since at least the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>This autumn, both the Sun and the Mail have responded to what the Mail\u2019s owner called a \u201cchallenging market\u201d for newspapers by making editorial redundancies. A Sun journalist emailed me: \u201cJust had massive compulsory redundos in editorial. Hardly enough bodies left to get out the paper. Mood is of the post-apocalyptic variety \u2013 survivors staggering around dazed and confused.\u201d</p> <p>Anslow, who started on the Sun 39 years ago, was one of those culled. Well before it happened, he told me he could imagine a Britain without tabloids \u201cwithin my lifetime\u201d. He went on: \u201cIf you take that kind of political communication away, we [Britons] will all go into our own ideological silos, because of the way social media works.\u201d</p> <p>More surprisingly, Tom Baldwin also fears that if the tabloids die, then what comes next could be worse. \u201cTheir political stories contain at least kernels of truth,\u201d he says. \u201cWithout the tabloids, we\u2019ll be in a totally post-truth world.\u201d But in a world without tabloid truths, perhaps other kinds of politics will have a chance.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread?ref_src=twsrc^google|twcamp^serp|twgr^author\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\"> here</a>.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Producing in-depth, thoughtful, well-reported journalism is difficult and expensive \u2013 but supporting us isn\u2019t.

  "<p>Inside a converted flower warehouse off a scruffy street in Paris\u2019s 18th arrondissement, the world\u2019s largest computer games company is preparing its latest assault on the world\u2019s screens.</p> <p>On Friday, Skylanders Academy, a CGI animation based on a $3bn (\u00a32.5bn) combined video game/toy franchise aimed at pre-teens, will hit Netflix.</p> <p>It is the first release from Activision Blizzard Studios, a division of the gaming behemoth behind titles including Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Destiny, set up last year to take games to TV and screen. </p> <p>Activision animation partner TeamTO have 160 people working on the project at its headquarters in the French capital and a second site in the south of France.</p> <p>The TeamTO director general and founder, Guillaume Hellouin, says the resources were roughly equivalent to those needed for a CGI film. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the most ambitious TV series we have had the chance to work on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s close to feature film quality in terms of image sophistication.\u201d</p> <p>Skylanders has signed up a cast of high-class voice actors. The lead, a purple dragon called Spyro, who first appeared as a video game character in 1998, is voiced by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0519043/\">Justin Long</a>, best known for starring in Dodgeball, and one Spyro\u2019s best friends, a walking pile of rock and magma <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://skylanders.wikia.com/wiki/Eruptor\">called Eruptor</a>, is played by Breaking Bad\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0052186/\">Jonathan Banks</a>. Oscar-winner Susan Sarandon voices a villain called the Golden Queen.</p> <p>The crossover between video games and TV and film is nothing new. From DuckTales on the NES console in the early 1990s, via Bob Hoskins in the movie Super Mario Brothers in 1993, to the forthcoming Assassin\u2019s Creed film starring Michael Fassbender, traffic between the mediums has been busy. There are even plans to make a series of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/28/tetris-films-trilogy\">films based on Tetris</a>.</p> <p>But what is new is the way in which Activison is bringing overall control inside the business, rather than licensing others to do the work and take most of the risk.</p> <p>Coco Francini, the vice-president of development at Activision\u2019s studio and Skylanders producer, says: \u201cI think that a lot of companies licence out their intellectual property, and obviously we are not doing that.</p> <p>\u201cWe are accountable to the standards of excellence of the entire company ... and we work with the people who make the games, we know the DNA of what makes them successful by talking to those people and meeting with those studios.\u201d</p> <p>Activision has brought in big names to oversee the project. The co-president, Stacey Sher, has produced critically acclaimed films including Erin Brockovich and Matilda, and worked alongside Francini, whose credits include Django Unchained, with Quentin Tarantino. Her co-president Nick van Dyk is a former Disney executive who played a key role in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jan/24/citynews.business\">acquiring Pixar</a>, Marvel and Star Wars for the studio.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f97aa2025f1819bf6369282d4a70e173b5aead38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f97aa2025f1819bf6369282d4a70e173b5aead38/45_0_1328_797/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eruptor in Skylanders Academy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eruptor, right, voiced by Jonathan Banks, is one of the characters in Skylanders Academy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TeamTO/Activision Blizzard Studios</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The approach suggests a desire to avoid the mistakes of the past, which Sher acknowledges. \u201cPeople are always looking for great intellectual property. And I think coming from my background in film and television that the places where I\u2019ve imagined people don\u2019t always get it right is also investing in character.</p> <p>\u201cCharacter is the thing that puts you into the best of filmed entertainment, character and storytelling.\u201d</p> <p>Those mistakes are reflected in the more miss than hit record of computer game adaptations. World of Warcraft, based on Activision\u2019s online role playing game, was critically panned and <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-analysis-warcraft-avoids-910268?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=THR%20Box%20Office_2016-07-13%2006:00:00_awashington&amp;utm_term=hollywoodreporter_boxoffice\">lost a reported $15m</a> on a budget of $160m. It was only saved from complete financial failure by a strong showing in China. But there are other reasons to want to be more directly involved.</p> <p>Prof Ian Bogost of the Georgia Institute of Technology says: \u201cYou could say they are doing this to maintain better creative control. Exert more creative force. They might also be doing that so they can own more of that profit chain. Especially since the mechanics of Hollywood deals are so backwards and complicated.\u201d</p> <p>Activision\u2019s next project after Skylanders is a film version of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/call-of-duty\">Call of Duty</a> franchise, which has made more than $10bn worldwide. </p> <p>Despite the success of titles such as Call of Duty and wider penetration of gaming into the mainstream, Bogost thinks Activision will still have difficulty escaping the snobbery that stops it going beyond a core audience, in part because the games that have truly broken into the mainstream do not lend themselves to linear narratives. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s still a kind of handicap at work. The biggest cultural shift is [in] the number of people who play rather ordinary games,\u201d he says, citing the likes of Candy Crush and Flappy Bird. <br></p> <p>\u201cYou can imagine an argument that games are widespread enough to justify, for the first time, a broad slate of adaptations of games. But I\u2019m still not sure that\u2019s likely to produce the kind of mainstream success even of the kind [that has come from] comic books, which took 50 years to make it to mass market.<br></p> <p>\u201cHistory seems to show us that it hasn\u2019t been successful doing that. We\u2019ve been trying to do that for decades. Is there reason to believe it\u2019s different now?\u201d</p> <p>But Activision\u2019s Van Dyk is targeting exactly that kind of breakout hit with the games it chooses to adapt. \u201cWe will look for intellectual property that has passionate following, but I think we want to make programming for everybody. That respects and celebrates players of the game, but also makes this content as broadly appealing as it can be. </p> <p>\u201cIf you look at Marvel, they make a Thor movie not just for people who read Thor comics. It needs to be a great film for everyone.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Why has Britain\u2019s response to the dismantling of the refugee camp in Calais been so lively \u2013 or ugly? Because it raises fundamental questions about who we are as a country.</p> <p>Migration is being discussed, but it\u2019s a debate bedevilled by myth. There never was a time when Britain and the British identity was impervious to migration. Migration to Britain didn\u2019t begin when we joined the EU. The more common but equally faulty story that Britain slowly developed organically from Anglo-Saxon roots, until the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/23/immigration-windrush-west-indians-jamaica-britain\">Windrush</a> arrived from the Caribbean and changed everything, is an increasingly embarrassing sign that we simply don\u2019t know the facts of our own history. The key economic, political and cultural events in our history \u2013 Roman Britain, the development of the English language, Magna Carta, the industrial revolution, the world wars \u2013 cannot be understood without reference to migration.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/operation-to-clear-calais-refugee-camp-finishes-ahead-of-schedule\">Concern grows for 'left-behind' child refugees as fires hit Calais camp</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Three themes resonate across the centuries. First, immigration has been intimately tied to economic innovation and growth, notably finance, trade, wool and silk production, metalworking, and of course the enslavement of Africans that helped to fund the industrial revolution. One of the best-known examples is the tens of thousands of French Protestant refugees (Huguenots) who from the 1680s onwards settled in Britain. As the historian William Pettigrew writes on the Runnymede Trust\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.ourmigrationstory.org.uk/\">new website, ourmigrationstory.org.uk</a>: \u201cThey revolutionised the textiles industries, the arts and journalism, and provided much of the hard cash for the financial revolution that took place in London in the 1690s and allowed the English state to defeat Louis XIV.\u201d Silkweavers were perhaps most prominent in shaping the identity of Spitalfields, but they also spread to Macclesfield and Sudbury in Suffolk, where silkweaving is still practised.</p> <p>Second, the waves of migration were accompanied by waves of discrimination and violence against the migrants. The <a href=\"http://www.ourmigrationstory.org.uk/oms/from-slavery-to-freedom-the-narrative-of-james-albert-ukawsaw-gronniosaw\">Narrative of the freed slave James Albert Ukawsaw Gronniosaw</a> reveals the extent of Britain\u2019s links to the transatlantic slave trade, the development of British colonies, and how its connections to the Americas underpinned migration links back to Britain. During the American war of independence (1775-83), but also during the seven years\u2019 war (1754-63) and the war of 1812 (1812-15), Britain offered freedom to any enslaved man willing to fight on its side. This was often the only way out of slavery, and following the 1772 Somerset case, formerly enslaved people were legally protected from being returned to the Americas.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/26/fires-burn-in-calais-jungle-as-demolition-operation-continues-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59c5f\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2843250\"            data-video-name=\"Fires burn in Calais refugee camp as demolition operation continues \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5810c2a5e4b01c528432cec1\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/26/161026calaisburns_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/26/161026calaisburns.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/26/161026calaisburns_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/26/fires-burn-in-calais-jungle-as-demolition-operation-continues-video\">Fires burn in Calais Jungle as demolition operation continues \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Gronniosaw was one of the thousands of migrants who made the journey. to Britain, and is known to us because his \u2018Narrative\u2019 went through many reprints. As Gronniosaw explains in his narrative, he met his wife, a white textile worker named Betty, and travelled with his children around the country looking for work. <a href=\"https://www.history.ox.ac.uk/people/dr-ryan-hanley\">Historian Ryan Hanley</a> says: \u201cNot only did migrants like Gronniosaw experience many of the hardships common to poor people in Britain at the time, but they also had to contend with racial prejudice.\u201d</p> <p>The third theme is more positive. The historical record shows how the British people and state could and would accept migrants, and that migrants generally integrate. The state\u2019s response, as in <a href=\"http://www.ourmigrationstory.org.uk/oms/becoming-english-letters-of-denization\">the Letters of Denization</a> (which gave migrants the protections of citizens), or the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_Relations_Act_1965\">1965 Race Relations Act</a>, was often a less complete affirmation of open, inclusive definitions of our country, and more a way of defending notable and principled citizens. They have existed down the ages; think Daniel Defoe writing in 1701 (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/44081\">Since scarce one family is left alive, / Which does not from some foreigner derive</a>.\u201d) or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/gary-lineker-hits-back-at-online-abuse-over-hideously-racist-coverage-refugees\">Gary Lineker speaking up for migrants in 2016. </a></p> <p>Because of their success, we barely acknowledge the multiple examples of migrant contribution, even the more recent ones \u2013 be they Marks &amp; Spencer, Tesco, or easyJet. We should better excavate that history at local levels across the country whether in public records offices, buildings, or even cemeteries and death records.</p> <p>Integration has most obviously occurred in the case of the Huguenots, who \u2013 along with other white European migrants \u2013 have simply been absorbed into Britishness. Will the British-born children of Polish migrants be more likely to follow this route to integration than the great-grandchildren of migrants from the Caribbean?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are, as we have always been, a country defined by immigration (and indeed emigration)</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some groups \u2013 notably <a href=\"http://www.ourmigrationstory.org.uk/oms/romani-gypsies-in-16th-century-britain\">Jews, Roma, Gypsies</a>, African and Asian people \u2013 have been continually excluded, with our society actively blocking their integration. The belief that British identity struggles to include those identified as outsiders on grounds of race or ethnicity is also supported by evidence of discrimination in the labour market and other <a href=\"http://www.runnymedetrust.org/uploads/CERD%20Civil%20Society%20Report%20UKfinal.pdf\">worrying indicators of social outcomes</a>.</p> <p>To the question of who we are, there is an obvious answer. We are, as we have always been, a country defined by immigration (and indeed emigration). It\u2019s a truth we should embrace, one that will provide the best resources for our success in the 21st century, post-Brexit or otherwise. But right now that truth is elusive. It\u2019s strange to see Germany, a country with much less history of migration and with onerous baggage from its past, appearing more confident in terms of its identity and values.</p> <p>Many in Britain spoke this year of \u201ctaking our country back\u201d, asserting the importance of sovereignty and democracy in the face of European bureaucracy. But it\u2019s equally obvious that many based those aspirations on an imaginary history. This confusion imposes a cost, as the notion of a country where people of migrant background are never truly British doesn\u2019t just misunderstand our past, it also pushes our nation down a route towards economic stagnation and social conflict.</p> <p>The good news is that for the foreseeable future, where we stand in terms of identity will be at the centre of national discussion. Let that be an informed discussion. This post-EU referendum moment allows us to face up to who we have been, and to understand who we are today.</p>",

Justin Gleeson, the final version of its bill</a> to strip terrorists of Australian citizenship.</p> <p>That fact was revealed in a high-profile stoush between Gleeson and Brandis over whether the

  "<p>E-baby protagonist Nellie playfully likens her surrogacy to baking a cake. The couple paying her to carry their unborn child provided the ingredients and she is the oven, waiting for this small miracle to cook.</p> <p>As in many moments in this new play that tugs resolutely at the heart, Nellie \u2013 a working-class, bountiful, magnanimous mother-of-two \u2013 has hit the nail on the head. Written by former Fairfax journalist Jane Cafarella, e-baby is an endearing romp into the complex world of surrogacy. It mixes laugh-out-loud one-liners and witty repertoire with flashes of true grief and pain.</p> <p>The well-meaning if uptight Australian lawyer Catherine (a brilliantly skittish Danielle Carter) lives a privileged life in London with her younger architect husband. But after 11 years of trying for a baby and rounds of increasingly traumatic IFV, she still cannot conceive.

She offers $30,000 plus expenses. But while the money is acknowledged as a welcome perk, for Nellie, an ardent Christian, the appeal is as much about engineering new life and finding new purpose as it is about cash.</p> <p>Cafarella has based her play on decades of research into surrogacy, and e-baby covers tricky issues without ever passing judgment. Critically, the question of whether Nellie will want to keep the baby for herself never comes up, allowing space for more nuanced, if less dramatic, questions to be raised.</p> <p>Chief among these is the shifting of power, which propels the play along and gives it dramatic tension. Catherine is a control freak used to forcing success through sheer determination and will: she has the upper hand as the richer, more sophisticated party. But although initially compliant and cheerful, if somewhat goofily naive, Nellie slowly starts to smart under the micro-management of her body. Keeping it all together is a fragile friendship that begins with the best intentions and ends fractured. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/11/we-felt-cursed-how-altruistic-surrogacy-can-give-hope-after-years-of-heartbreak\">'We felt cursed': how altruistic surrogacy can give hope after years of heartbreak</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Set on a simple stage with just a handful of props, much of the drama unfolds through the lens of technology.

The awkward, hard-to-watch scenes (of which there are plenty) are often cut short, leaving me wishing Cafarella had the confidence to allow them to linger a little longer. The ending, too, feels rushed, and haphazard, as if the play doesn\u2019t quite know how to wrap itself up. Cafarella, who until then had avoided sappiness, settles for mushy sentimentality.

  "<p>House prices in Australia\u2019s two biggest cities surged in the September quarter, with rises of 3.1% in Melbourne and 2.7% in Sydney throwing Scott Morrison\u2019s comments about house prices into ever sharper relief.

But there is a basic economic principle that dominates these distortions over the longer run, and that is the interplay of housing supply and demand.<br></p> <p>Until very recently, Australia\u2019s strong population growth fuelled unrelenting growth in underlying demand for dwellings at a time when new building was not adding sufficiently to supply. This housing shortage, mixed with aggressive interest rate cuts and tax rules, underpinned strong house price gains.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/27/reserve-bank-could-justify-a-cut-on-cup-day-but-is-there-any-point\">Low inflation justifies a rate cut \u2013 but would it make any difference?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Economics 101 suggests that for a given level of growth in demand (population growth and household formation rates) a larger increase in supply will lower prices, regardless of tax rules. Why would a potential investor in housing, for example, buy a property when house prices and rents are flat or falling?</p> <p>New housing supply relative to a given level of demand will lower house prices and address housing affordability and issues such as negative gearing and capital gains tax will be largely immaterial. One only has to look at the recent trend in house prices in Perth (down 10% from the peak), Darwin (down 7%) and Karratha (down 65%) to show how a drop in demand relative to supply affects prices and therefore affordability. Anecdotally, there are very few investors lining up in those cities.</p> <p>The tax rules still apply in those cities, which makes it a furphy to focus on capital gains tax and negative gearing rules as a long-run driver of house prices. They are still absolutely vital issues in terms of tax efficiency, fairness and equity but in terms of driving house prices, they are a second-order issue behind supply.</p> <p>Investors see little or no benefit gearing up to invest in the stock market, where the returns have been problematic for many years, and prefer to invest in residential property where returns have generally been strongly positive. </p> <p>The supply issue gets complex when the issue is boiled down to a state, city, regional or even a suburban level. It is not easy to add to supply around Sydney harbour, for example. But that should not distort the fundamental need for new building across Sydney. </p> <p>A greater supply of dwellings will mean that both buyers and renters will be met with lots of choice. If the supply of dwellings increases by 1,000 and demand either from buyers or renters, from population growth and household formation, is an extra 900, the price of the house or rent must fall. This is regardless of tax rules. Why buy a property for investment purposes when the price is set to fall and/or the rental yield will fall given the glut of supply?</p> <p>Note Perth again in this context, where the 10% fall in prices over the past 18 months or so has been matched with a 25-year-high rental vacancy rate and rents are falling sharply. </p> <p>As noted, negative gearing rules and the very generous tax rules distort the market for investors when they judge the rental yield, capital gain and tax deductions will outpace the costs of undertaking that investment. It increases the amplitude of the house price cycle. It is not inconceivable that in a climate where prices and rents do fall, investors flee the market and sell into the falling market, driving yet more weakness. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/17/baby-boomers-have-already-taken-all-the-houses-now-theyre-coming-for-our-brunch\">Baby boomers have already taken all the houses, now they're coming for our brunch | Brigid Delaney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is also true that income tax scales influence investor behaviour as those paying the top marginal tax rates have a strong incentive to structure their affairs to reduce their tax. By way of illustration, if the income tax scale was zero (absurd, but this is to illustrate a point), negative gearing would not be possible. If the top rate was high and cut in at a low level, there would be a strong incentive to negatively gear. </p> <p>The fact that the top tax rate has been increased in recent years and the threshold held constant has increased demand for investment properties.</p> <p>The end point is that tax issues, however broad, would count for little if a surge in housing supply swamped demand.<br></p> <p> To be sure, it is difficult to engineer a lift in supply in the short run given the state and local governments largely control this space and new supply needs to be serviced by high-quality infrastructure (transport, schools, shops and the like) to make it desirable.

  "<p>It seems so long ago now, but in the print media age the crispest insights we gained into the mindset of sportspeople often came via the humble magazine Q&amp;A. Thus we learned the favoured tipple of Australian cricketers was either their home state\u2019s major brand of lager, or, if they were a little bit edgy, rum and coke. Entirely anomalous fast bowler Geoff Lawson didn\u2019t drink at all, so his team-mates sprayed the aforementioned beverages all over him.</p> <p>Once you\u2019d processed the fact that every male athlete in Australia thought The Shawshank Redemption was cinema\u2019s high water mark, the funniest answers were often in response to that classic hypothetical: who are your three dream dinner party guests? Were an Australian cricketer to exclude any of Elle Macpherson, Greg Norman or Nelson Mandela they stood alone as a maverick (and their name was probably Greg Mathews). </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/12/say-it-with-shane-warniemojis-is-the-app-no-one-asked-for\">Say it with Shane: WarnieMojis is the app no one asked for | Elle Hunt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many settled for that exact formation \u2013 not exactly a triumph in social dynamics, unless Mandela was having previously undocumented trouble with his short game or Macpherson had some particularly searching questions about the South African justice system. Sadly, this table formation never actually occurred outside the fever dreams of Sheffield Shield dressing rooms. </p> <p>Anyway, the point I\u2019m trying to make is that having yearned to know more about the interior lives of these men, once we had, we were often confronted with childlike internal monologues. Which brings me to Shane Warne, whose soap opera life is now set to be turned into an unauthorised telemovie by Australian TV network Seven. </p> <p>Bless him, Warne has never hidden from the fact that the pleasures he derives from life are simple and, thanks to social media, they\u2019re as achingly transparent to the general public now as at any point of his life. We no longer need the Q&amp;A, we can just scroll through Twitter and check which z-grade celebrity he\u2019s currently nattering away to, or which drinks are scattered around his poker table. </p> <p>We already know Warne\u2019s favourite movie is American Pie because he never stops tweeting about Stiffler, a character who would also presumably end up spearing a rissole at Warnie\u2019s dream dinner party, which would also be attended by Bruce Springsteen, Chris Martin, a topless Angelina Jolie and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/aug/19/shane-warnes-mural-succeeds-in-uniting-the-art-and-cricket-worlds\">the rest of the gang from the infamous Warnie mural.</a></p> <p>Which is not to say Warne is happy about being the butt of condescending jokes, a philosophy some would say is at odds with social media stream in which he posts topless photographs of himself looking up from bed into a full length ceiling mirror. In the last 20 years Warne has variously been described as a \u201cgenius\u201d by Archbishop Desmond Tutu and also been openly mocked by former team-mates, but nobody has ever accused him of being enigmatic. </p> <p>To explain why Warne isn\u2019t happy with his life being turned into scripted television, one should step back in time a little to his playing career, when a publishing cottage industry developed around the Australian leg-spinner. That genre produced Spun Out, Paul Barry\u2019s excruciating 540-page opus of tittle tattle and pop psychology (\u201csneering and priggish\u201d, one reviewer called it), on which the new TV production will be based. </p> <p>In short, and not just because of books like Barry\u2019s, Warne came to the firm view that the genre of biography should not exist at all. He\u2019s on record, in fact, for saying that it should be<em> illegal</em> to write a book about a figure such as himself without permission. For much of his playing career he accepted the tabloid media scrutiny that came as part and parcel of what some saw as indiscretions in his private life, shrugging his shoulders at the headlines, but the books enraged him. </p> <p>Shane Warne is actually many good things, and in a lot of respects his enduring vanity has served him well in life, but his decades-long aversion to <em>other people</em> telling his story is something he\u2019s never let go and doesn\u2019t quite fit with his 2016 persona. Australians have always tended to take Warne entirely seriously when he\u2019s discussed leg-spin or had a cricket ball in his hand, but not so much otherwise. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/picture/2016/jun/02/david-squires-on-shane-warne-and-the-ball-of-the-century\">David Squires on ... Shane Warne and the ball of the century</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The problem here for Warne is that having spent most of the last five years exposing every social and romantic happening of his waking life for all to see, he\u2019s not in a strong position to oppose a sensationalist TV series. How could it possibly be any stranger or more embarrassing than his actual life?</p> <p>The TV production basically writes itself, and if it\u2019s only movie-length, you sense the main problem for producers (and a relief for Warne) will be the process of omission. \u201cOK, we need John the Bookie in there, yep, and the diet pills, for sure, but when will the inflatable penis scene take place?\u201d</p> <p>In a poignant artistic flourish, maybe they\u2019ll start at the scene of Warne\u2019s first day job, delivering beds for Forty Winks, and perhaps end at his aborted rendezvous with Brynne Edelsten in May. \u201cBrynne then invited me back to her place around 1am for a nightcap, when I arrived, paparazzi were conveniently waiting outside her home to get the pic,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/confidential/shane-warne-furious-after-nightcap-pap-at-brynne-edelstons-house-after-celeb-poker-night-in-geelong/news-story/f2d78ad40fc488c9e2314f9bd4affc60\">Warne complained at the time</a>. \u201cI left instantly and thought how sad is that!\u201d </p> <p>Yet hovering awkwardly here is the possibility that no matter what the script-writers come up with, this new small-screen re-telling might not be anywhere near as \u201csad\u201d as the snippets we\u2019re so often fed by Warne himself. </p> <p>The cricket writer Christian Ryan once hit on a solid theory about Warne: maybe he\u2019ll always be more famous than he is loved. Maybe, one day, he\u2019ll assume a level of comfort with that fact. Whenever this telemovie airs, surely he\u2019ll also admit deep down that with respect to his own triumphant, turbulent and occasionally gobsmacking life, truth is far stranger than fiction.</p>",
  "<p>Growing up in multicultural Australia, I first really understood multiculturalism by going to school. Not via textbooks, but through my lived experience of making friends with kids from a dozen different cultural backgrounds, and being exposed to the range of different ethnic groups with whom I shared my suburb. I learned to get along with people very different from myself, or at the very least, I accepted their right to share my school community.</p> <p>For young people, schools are unique in their ability to foster these cross-cultural communication skills, and for orienting kids to the realities of our globalising world. British geographer Ash Amin describes schools as \u201cmicropublics\u201d, places where people from different backgrounds are thrown together on a daily basis to work together. In the process, they learn acceptance and cross-cultural understanding.</p> <p>However, not all schools are equally well-placed to achieve this. As families increasingly turn away from the local public school in favour of private schools that are often restricted to particular religious groups, and of course, restricted to those who can afford the fees, Australian children are less and less likely to encounter the full range of our diverse society within their school communities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2016/oct/27/all-they-see-is-your-race-because-that-is-whats-written-on-your-body-podcast\">'All they see is your race, because that is what's written on your body' | Christina Ho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The same can be said for selective schools, the focus of my latest research. As education policy increasingly emphasises competition, school choice and elite programs for the \u201cgifted and talented\u201d, a growing number of schools have become demographically unbalanced, so that they can no longer operate as \u201cmicropublics\u201d or microcosms of the wider community. </p> <p>Selective high schools routinely top the annual league tables of HSC results in NSW, often outperforming prestigious private schools. For instance, James Ruse Agricultural high school, in north-west Sydney, has outperformed all other schools in the HSC every year for the past 20 years. </p> <p>The outstanding achievements of selective schools come at a cost however, to their students and to the community more broadly. Apart from the allegations that these schools are \u201chothouses\u201d breeding stress and anxiety among their pupils, my research examined another dimension of these school communities: their hyper-racialised environments. </p> <p>Almost all selective high schools in Sydney are dominated by students from a language background other than English (LBOTE). According to the MySchool website, at James Ruse, 97% of students were from a LBOTE in 2015. Across Sydney, LBOTE students regularly make up 80 or 90% of enrolments in selective schools. Most of these students are children of migrants from various Asian countries, especially China, Korea, other east and south-east Asian countries, and increasingly, India and south Asia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/east-asian-school-success-culture-curriculum-teaching\">\u2018Culture, not just curriculum\u2019, determines east Asian school success</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This reflects Australia\u2019s elitist migration policy, which for the last 20 years, has favoured well-educated or wealthy applicants, who arrive as skilled or business migrants. As migration from Asia has grown, a new middle-class has formed in Australia, one that is more highly educated than native-born Australians. According to the Department of Immigration, among Australia\u2019s China-born and South Korea-born populations, nearly 40% hold a university degree, approximately double the national average. Among the India-born population, more than 50% hold a university degree.</p> <p>It is not entirely surprising that these families pay a great deal of attention to their children\u2019s education. They see education as the key mechanism for ensuring their children\u2019s future, in a society in which migrants lack the social networks and local knowledge that the native-born might use to get ahead.</p> <p>Arriving in Australia during an era of intensified educational competition, Asian migrants often adopt highly instrumental approaches to education, particularly around school choice (and residential choice), private tutoring, close monitoring of children\u2019s time use, and targeted training for selective admissions tests. As a result, their children now dominate the enrolments of most selective high schools. </p> <p>This ethnically unbalanced profile of selective schools has created a hyper-racialised environment within these school communities, in which people are eternally defined by their ethnicity. In Australia\u2019s multicultural society, we would hope that people working together would get to know each other as individuals, rather than perpetually seeing others as members of a particular ethnic group. Cultural difference could then become normal and unremarkable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Christina Ho on the ethnic imbalance in our selective schools\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/290188606&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In selective schools however, cultural difference is hyper-visible and a key means by which people identify themselves and others. As a minority group, Anglo-Australian students feel their whiteness more keenly in selective schools, while many Asian-Australian students feel more \u201cAsian\u201d, or adopt a more \u201cAsian\u201d identity than they might do in a more ethnically balanced environment. Even the homogenising label \u201cAsian\u201d \u2013 widely used by students from all backgrounds \u2013 fails to capture people\u2019s precise ethnic identity, and seems almost designed to emphasise difference from \u201cwhite\u201d. </p> <p>My interviewees, who included current students and recent graduates of selective schools, described how people\u2019s interests, abilities and preferences were seen in terms of ethnicity, and even subjects were racialised. Maths and sciences were \u201cAsian\u201d subjects, while the humanities and extra-curricular activities like debating and sport were \u201cwhite\u201d pursuits. These stereotypes could be damaging. For example, the notion that white students are \u201chopeless at maths\u201d could undermine their confidence in the subject, as one interviewee told me.</p> <p>In the playground, students often organised themselves by ethnicity, with \u201call white\u201d or \u201call Asian\u201d friendship groups sitting in their own demarcated spaces. One student told me that the \u201cwhite girls\u201d in her school even invented their own language, which they spoke loudly to each other whenever other students spoke Chinese. Another student described how the boys\u2019 lunchtime soccer teams were based on ethnicity, with the Indian (\u201ccurries\u201d) and white students teamed up against \u201cthe Asians\u201d, an arrangement known as \u201ccheckerboards versus the Asians\u201d.</p> <p>While hyper-racialised environments do not necessarily foster racism, and most of my interviewees denied that there was racial tension in their schools, they artificially inflate the importance of ethnic identification. This may make it more difficult to broaden one\u2019s outlook by transgressing cultural boundaries, or develop full-bodied cross-cultural understanding.</p> <p>Of course there are some students who do cross those boundaries and befriend people from different backgrounds to themselves. Among my interviewees were two Anglo-Australian students who joined \u201cAsian\u201d friendship groups, became fluent Chinese speakers and developed ambitions to live and work in China. One even dreams about becoming Australia\u2019s ambassador to China.</p> <p>However, systemically, selective schools are all about segregating a select few from the mainstream. These schools are also segregated from their local communities. Their enrolments do not reflect the demographic profile of the local areas in which they are located. In most cases, students of selective schools do not reside locally, but often commute long distances.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/22/china-education-exams-parents-rebel\">Nine-hour tests and lots of pressure: welcome to the Chinese school system</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While the local public school can be a significant site of \u201ceveryday multiculturalism\u201d for young people and their families, selective schools rarely function as local schools, depriving their local areas of this potential micropublic. </p> <p>Ultimately, as Australia\u2019s education system becomes increasingly segmented by policies encouraging choice and competition, our schools are less and less capable of providing environments for young people to encounter diversity and learn how to deal with the rich mix of cultures found in our globalising society. </p> <p>For me, the extreme imbalance in selective school communities highlights the importance of the local comprehensive public school, where all are welcome, and where students encounter maximum diversity, not only in terms of ethnicity, but also socioeconomic status, religion, ability, aspirations and interests, and all the strange and wonderful subcultures that make up our community. Exposure to all of this is an education in itself. </p>",

  "<p>Three years ago, when I became the first dedicated commissioner for Aboriginal children and young people in Victoria, there were 922 Koori children living in out-of-home care in the state.</p> <p>We knew that was far too many, and greatly exceeding national rates. But we thought it was surely a small enough number that we could learn about each and every one of them personally, to find out what had happened, why their numbers were growing and why their experiences and trajectories were so poor.</p> <p>Just as importantly, we wanted to find out why so few of them were in the care of their own Koori kin, or connected to their community, culture and country. </p> <p>In 2014, in partnership with the department of health and human services, we launched Taskforce 1000: an 18-month journey across the state to critically review each child\u2019s circumstances.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/08/australia-must-act-now-to-prevent-a-new-stolen-generation-tragedy\">Australia must act now to prevent a new Stolen Generation tragedy | Michael Lavarch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The aim was to bring together everyone responsible for providing services \u2013 child protection, paediatricians, mental health and sexual assault specialists, Aboriginal community-controlled organisations and community service organisations \u2013 who could help shine a light on that young person\u2019s experience in the system designed to protect them. To go beyond the files, to understand why decisions had been made, or not made, and to offer solutions for each child.</p> <p>Our findings, tabled this week in the Victorian parliament, should sound an alarm around the nation. Firstly, about why our kids go into care in the first place \u2013 overwhelmingly due to family violence and parental drug and alcohol abuse \u2013 and secondly, about what happens next.</p> <p>Many children, of course, receive strong support and do well, but we heard case after case of highly vulnerable, deeply distressed children being failed at the hands of the state across multiple agencies, including child protection, out-of-home care, police, education and youth justice. </p> <p>As well as often neglecting to address their physical, mental and emotional needs, our system is failing to address their familial and cultural rights, failing the families and communities to which they belong. Failing to learn the lessons of the stolen generations.</p> <p>Against all policies, principles and guidelines, we saw many children who did not even know they were Aboriginal left for years in care \u2013 isolated from their family, culture and country \u2013 when they might have been in the loving care of Koori relatives.</p> <p>More than 86% were case-managed by a non-Aboriginal agency, 91% placed with non-Aboriginal carers, and more than 40% separated from their brothers and sisters. In one case, four siblings, two per set, were case-managed in the same department office by two different practitioners who had no idea they were related and had completely different views on the mother\u2019s capacity to provide care for them. </p> <p>Thankfully, as a result of the Taskforce\u2019s intervention, all four are now on a reunification plan to live with their mum. </p> <p>In many other cases, siblings were separated because a grandmother\u2019s house was regarded as too small for all of them. The same department responsible for child protection also manages housing, but in the cases I heard no one even bothered to follow up to see if something bigger could be found so the family could be kept together.</p> <p>These are lessons for beyond Victoria too, as we await the investigation of the royal commission into juvenile justice abuses in the Northern Territory, knowing that for many the direct pathway from out-of-home care is the criminal justice system.</p> <p>It\u2019s impossible to say which of the Taskforce 1000 cases is the most distressing.</p> <p>Lucas, who after years of abuse from his father was diagnosed at nine with post-traumatic stress disorder and would lie unsettled at night, crying, scared, describing shadowy figures hovering over his bed, and suffering from recurrent nightmares about his mother dying. Yet by the age of 12 \u2013 so young and deeply wounded and troubled \u2013 he had been held in isolation on numerous occasions in police and youth justice detention, restrained, handcuffed and subjected to routine strip searches.</p> <p>Or Bert, who was five years old when he and his younger siblings first came to the attention of child protection. It took eight years and multiple episodes of harm before he was taken into care, where he disclosed experiences of sexual abuse to police. Two years later, when we reviewed his case, no charges had been laid and he had received no counselling.</p> <p>These are children who were taken into care to keep them safe and well. Yet many are not safe and well in state care, and they have been denied safer and more nurturing options with Aboriginal family and community. </p> <p>We were told time and again by child protection that they had been unable to trace a child\u2019s Aboriginal family when we were able to track them down on Facebook within minutes.</p> <p>Often no one even checked if a child was Aboriginal. This is not about paperwork or data collection; ascertaining a child\u2019s Aboriginal status is supposed to trigger a range of interventions and protections. I say \u201csupposed to\u201d because my office also looked at one of the most fundamental protections, the Aboriginal Child Placement Principle, which upholds the right of Aboriginal children to be placed where they are safe in their culture and identity. A review of 65 random files selected by child protection did not uncover a single case where agencies complied fully with this principle. Not one. Nor any effort from the top to even check that this process was occurring.</p> <p>This demonstrates non-compliance and deficiencies across many parts of the system, the impact of ignorance and indifference, lack of accountability, and of an embedded racism that does not value Aboriginal family and culture.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/feb/12/youre-not-given-any-love-the-stories-of-australias-stolen-generations-photo-essay\">'You're not given any love': the stories of Australia's stolen generations \u2013 photo essay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It also echoes the warning heard at the Northern Territory royal commission this month against an \u201cinquiry mentality\u201d, in which reporting is accepted as a replacement for results.</p> <p>In each Taskforce 1000 case, we asked child protection case workers to put together genograms \u2013 powerful extended versions of family trees that can reveal relationships and experiences over generations \u2013 to tell the child\u2019s story. </p> <p>As we laid them out across desks or on the tables and floors for each Taskforce panel, these documents provided a graphic illustration of the impact of invasion and colonisation, past policies of assimilation, and of intergenerational disengagement and disempowerment. </p> <p>Each relative was represented in a little box. There were so many boxes marked with a cross, indicating family members who had committed suicide. So many with symbols to indicate they had been in child protection themselves. We also saw generations of connection with the criminal justice system, unemployment, poverty, and poor education. We saw the overriding impact of the past on the present. </p> <p>We didn\u2019t need to look to the next pages. We know what future awaits so many of these children if we don\u2019t intervene now and in the right way.</p> <p> </p> <p>Victoria has strong policies, and a state government, premier and minister committed to self-determination and fundamental reform in family violence and child protection. But the system is just not working on the ground for Koori kids \u2013 and that is a fact.</p> <p>For me, each and every story we heard through Taskforce 1000 was distressing. But what distressed me most was that, since we launched the inquiry, the number of Koori children in out-of-home care in Victoria has doubled. There are now nearly 1800. How high does it have to go before we start to bring them home?</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The <a href=\"http://www.ccyp.vic.gov.au/aboutus/news/taskforce-1000-mr.htm\">Taskforce 1000 report</a> is published by t</em><em>he Commission for Children and Young People.</em></p>"
