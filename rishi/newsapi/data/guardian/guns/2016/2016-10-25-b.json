  "<p>A few weeks ago I got a message from a university friend in Ohio. He sent me a <a href=\"http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/01-the-lady-vanishes\">podcast interview</a> with Julia Gillard in which she detailed the misogyny she experienced as Australia\u2019s prime minister, and asked, \u201cIs it really like that over there?\u201d</p> <p>Yes. Not always. But, unfortunately, yes.</p> <p>As Americans contemplate their first female president, they are curious about how a 21st century, first-world, English-speaking nation handles its first female leader. Understandably, America is looking to Australia\u2019s very recent experience with Gillard. Culturally, the two countries share much. Also, Gillard is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/21/julia-gillard-from-australias-first-female-prime-minister-to-international-superstar\">good friends</a> with Hillary Clinton and appears in her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/20/julia-gillard-backs-hillary-clinton-us-presidential-campaign-video\">campaign material</a>. Furthermore, Gillard is also often in the US, speaking publicly, and is able to give the American media <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/27/julia-gillard-urges-americans-of-all-parties-to-defend-hillary-clinton-against-sexism\">direct insight</a> into her time in office.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/24/elizabeth-warren-trump-clinton-nasty-women-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/593xf\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2836581\"            data-video-name=\"'Nasty women vote': Elizabeth Warren takes a swipe at Trump \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580e6205e4b0219a00d38178\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/24/161024warren_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/24/161024warren.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/24/161024warren_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/24/elizabeth-warren-trump-clinton-nasty-women-video\">\u2018Nasty women vote\u2019: Elizabeth Warren takes a swipe at Trump</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>This trend has picked up pace since Clinton was endorsed at the Democratic national convention in July.

She calculated that she didn\u2019t need to confront it because it would fade. Instead, the misogyny grew stronger, louder and uglier. </p> <p>Like the proverbial frog in the pot of water, Gillard didn\u2019t recognise the environment around her was growing hotter until it boiled over. Neither did most of us \u2013 as Gillard points out now, no one was seriously calling out the insinuations, insults and jibes, and as a result the pattern of sexist attacks grew bolder and were adopted and legitimised by her political opponents. </p> <p>My university friend also asked if I, as first female premier of New South Wales, experienced the same kind of sexism that Gillard did. The answer is yes: it was different, but yes. </p> <p>For example, my Liberal opponent Barry O\u2019Farrell often described me as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Hansard/Pages/HansardResult.aspx#/docid/HANSARD-1323879322-45695\">the Kim Kardashian of state politics</a>\u201d. Apparently my shared gender and initials with Ms Kardashian meant the TV reality star and I were one and the same, never mind what policies or experience or qualifications I brought to the job of MP, minister and premier. (Mr O\u2019Farrell also used parliament to <a href=\"https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Hansard/Pages/HansardResult.aspx#/docid/HANSARD-1323879322-46338\">compare</a> Carmel Tebbutt to a whining puppy and <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/barry-ofarrell-accused-of-racial-slur-against-indigenous-labor-frontbencher-linda-burney-20130820-2s93s.html\">to tell Linda Burney</a> she hadn\u2019t achieved her positions on merit, that she could play a hooker on a rugby league team, and to describe her as \u201ccasting her spells\u201d.) </p> <p>When I finally stood up to his Kardashian bullying, the media \u2013 who had said almost nothing about his constant belittlement \u2013 went into <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/keneally-keeps-up-with-kardashians-by-turning-the-jibe-on-ofarrell-20120214-1t49p.html\">meltdown</a> about how I handed it back to him.</p> <p>But I tell you what, he never did it again.</p> <p>Frankly, Australia, that we didn\u2019t stand up for our first female prime minister when the ugly strain of sexism reared its head: that\u2019s on all of us.

She will also have Republican opponents who will find it politically necessary between now and the congressional mid-terms to convince voters, women and men alike, that they aren\u2019t all misogynistic thugs. In short, unlike Gillard, Clinton will be able to call out the sexism when it happens.

The families visited a clinic twice a week for six months, where parents were videoed with their children and a box of toys. Autistic children might not interact with their parents at all, but when eventually a child did offer a toy or made a noise that could be interpreted as a request, the incident was rerun on video and the parent encouraged to respond. If the child offered a toy, the parent reciprocated. If the child said a word, the parent repeated it and added something. The practice was repeated at home every day.</p> <p>The therapy continued with the parents for the next six months with less intensity. At the end of the first year, the researchers could see the children had improved, but the most dramatic development was seen at the follow-up six years later. At the start of the trial, 50% of those in the control group who did not get the therapy and 55% of those who did were assessed as severely autistic. The children in the intervention group, though, got better. The proportion assessed as severe in the control group was 63% by the end of six years, compared with 46% in the intervention group.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c56c9a2b39167ee27661de0fb4bbe39f3e4cb71d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c56c9a2b39167ee27661de0fb4bbe39f3e4cb71d/0_1496_4044_2427/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Uta Frith, emeritus professor of cognitive development at UCL\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uta Frith, emeritus professor of cognitive development at UCL, said called the study \u2018a remarkably positive story\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Zazueta Olmos/Antonio Olmos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other experts applauded the work. \u201cI can see why these researchers are excited,\u201d said Dorothy Bishop, professor of developmental neuropsychology at the University of Oxford. \u201cThese results at follow-up are pretty consistent in showing the benefit of this early intervention for autism across a range of measures. My impression is that this is an intervention that reduces the severity of autistic symptoms, rather than curing autism. Nevertheless, for parents of children with autism, even a modest reduction would be worthwhile.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Max Davie, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said it offered \u201ca hugely cheering message for families\u201d, while Uta Frith, emeritus professor of cognitive development at University College London, called it \u201ca remarkably positive story, because the intervention itself was neither intensive nor invasive\u201d.</p> <p>The absence of any hope, as well as the very sudden regression in children\u2019s behaviour, led many parents to believe in the discredited theory of Andrew Wakefield that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/mmr\">MMR</a> (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine was the cause of autism. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Autism\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ftheguardian%2Fvideos%2F579550315566069%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=400&amp;height=400\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" style=\"max-width:400px;max-height:400px\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cParents commonly tell us that they fight for a diagnosis but when they finally get it the cupboard is bare, with little information or tailored support available to them,\u201d said Dr James Cusack, director of science at the charity Autistica.<strong> \u201c</strong>Too often, parents fall victim to the false claims of charlatans who prey on desperate families. These results look promising for the many thousands of parents who want to find early interventions for their children based on solid science.\u201d</p> <p>The researchers said children\u2019s communication with their parents was improved at the end of the six years. The parents said there were also improvements in relations with other children, in social communication and in repetitive behaviours. But there was no change in child anxiety, challenging behaviours or depression in the autistic children and they would still need a lot of support while growing up.</p> <p>About 1% of children and young people are affected by autistic spectrum disorder, which ranges from mild to severe.

It increases civil penalties and introduces criminal offences for serious breaches of officials\u2019 duties.</p> <p>In Senate estimates last Wednesday, Cash said the bill has not been amended because it had been a double-dissolution trigger and therefore needed to be reintroduced in identical form.</p> <p>She said the government would consider technical amendments if they were \u201cnecessary\u201d. </p> <p>But after repeated requests to clarify whether the government would make amendments to prevent its retrospective effect, a spokesman for Cash said only that the Senate could move amendments without compromising the ability to take the bill to a joint sitting.</p> <p>It is the second dispute about retrospectivity of elements of the government\u2019s industrial relations agenda.

Will this mean disclosure requirements are retrospective and impossible to comply with?\u201d</p> <p>Employment law expert and Adelaide law school professor, Andrew Stewart, said the retrospective effect of the building code was an even greater problem that was causing major concern in the construction industry.</p> <p>\u201cVirtually every major builder will be noncompliant,\u201d he said, because of the broad range of deal content barred by the code and its retrospective effect.</p> <p>He said the code could be changed to only bar agreements struck after it passed, in which case it would have \u201cminimal practical effect\u201d, or it would apply retrospectively and \u201cforce building companies to renegotiate their enterprise agreements simultaneously causing industrial mayhem\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the government has to change [the code], and will have to change it, how will they do it in a way that doesn\u2019t remove any practical effect for this whole term of government?\u201d</p> <p>Stewart said the code barred \u201cany clauses with any impact on productivity, or the right of companies to manage their business\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt essentially gives [Fair Work Building and Construction director] Nigel Hadgkiss or whoever is the director of the ABCC discretion to object to any union agreement on a very wide number of bases.\u201d</p>",

The issues need to be resolved at a future convention in the first half of 2017, according to the motion.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/21/tony-abbott-to-defy-malcolm-turnbull-over-nsw-liberal-party-preselections\">Tony Abbott to defy Malcolm Turnbull over NSW Liberal party preselections</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fiery state council meeting came at the end of a controversial week in parliament which saw Turnbull, justice minister Michael Keenan and key conservative immigration minister Peter Dutton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/20/turnbull-dutton-and-keenan-contradict-abbott-over-gun-deal-with-leyonhjelm\">challenge Abbott\u2019s version of the guns-for-votes deal</a>.</p> <p>Villatora said the Turnbull-Mike Baird motion was a big step forward but stressed any convention should be binding.</p> <p>\u201cA plebiscite cannot be based on a model that is half pregnant,\u201d Villatora said. \u201cWe should have genuine plebiscites and not bother pandering to lobbyists and powerbrokers.\u201d<br></p> <p>The dominant moderate faction in NSW has opposed changes which would allow all members a vote in preselections for MPs. The right wing has generally been more supportive of plebiscites, though leading moderates Turnbull and Baird are key supporters. </p> <p>A former NSW president, North Sydney MP Trent Zimmerman, said after the conference there had to be safeguards on plebiscites to ensure branch stacking did not occur.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to stop people who will join the party just to influence the preselection, never be seen at a branch meeting, never to be seen working on election campaigns and never to be seen again after we have had a preselection,\u201d Zimmerman told Sky News.</p> <p>Villatora said he would be looking to the party leadership to ensure the state council motion was not a delaying tactic.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe only acceptable model is a true plebiscite, not the attempt to maintain the control of lobbyists and powerbrokers of 40% central control and an arbiter to judge other members to determine who is a genuine member,\u201d Villatora said.</p> <p>\u201cWe continue to look to leadership to ensure that Saturday\u2019s motion was not an obvious ploy to kick the can down the road as another delaying tactic but is a binding convention all genuine members can look forward to, a binding \u201cone member, one vote\u201d convention that will unite the party.\u201d</p> <p>Villatora described the momentum for change in the party as \u201cunstoppable\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe only reason we have seen this progress is due to the pressure rank-and-file members have exerted on party and the leadership of the prime minister, Tony Abbott, John Howard, NSW premier Mike Baird, Angus Taylor, and General Major (rtd) Jim Molan,\u201d Villatora said in a statement. </p> <p>NSW party president Kent Johns would not comment on issues up for discussion at the convention but he said the resolutions ensured that \u201ceverything was on the table\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMy job is to arrange the convention and make sure everyone has a say and out of it, we will become a stronger party and a better party,\u201d Johns said. </p>",

At the age of 14, while on the books of the Rennes academy after leaving family and home comforts behind in Brittany, the Frenchman was diagnosed with leukaemia and told by doctors that his career was finished before it had started. Kermorgant underwent two years of treatment and did not kick a ball for the next four.</p> <p>\u201cI was told I was not supposed to play football again, that I would struggle to run and even to walk,\u201d Kermorgant says. \u201cBut I got better and better and I started to play football for fun with my friends. I was still a student and I was not thinking about playing properly again. After I started to feel better but I was not in the right place to do so. I needed to move somewhere outside the cocoon of my family and friends and everything. I gave myself a year to see if I could succeed and if not, I would carry on with my studies.\u201d</p> <p>Kermorgant never looked back. After juggling his degree in sports science and sports management at the University of Rennes with playing for his hometown club Vannes, he joined the fourth-tier club Ch\u00e2tellerault. His form there \u2013 hitting double figures over the course of the season \u2013 earned him a professional contract with Grenoble, the Ligue 2 club, at the age of 24. At the same time, a young Giroud was maturing after coming through the club\u2019s academy.</p> <p>\u201cWe played together a long time ago now,\u201d recalls Kermorgant. \u201cI played a few games with him over one season but not many because he came from the academy, he was young and after he went on loan.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/24/arsenal-olivier-giroud-reading-yann-kermorgant-efl-cup\">Arsenal\u2019s Olivier Giroud and Reading\u2019s Yann Kermorgant get an unlikely reunion</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>",

But he said exactly the right thing about the youngsters to whom he has given starts: \u201cIf they can\u2019t perform tonight, it\u2019s my responsibility not theirs, so they can feel free and play football with joy in their eyes.\u201d <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580f9eaee4b01c528432c867\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-25T18:05:35.936Z\">7.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p> Hello and welcome to an interesting and potential entertaining fourth-round League Cup bout. This is the only trophy that Liverpool and Tottenham have won for nearly a decade and they\u2019d quite like to win it again even if their team selections confirm that their priorities lie elsewhere, especially Liverpool even though they, unlike Spurs, do not have European escapades on top of domestic action this season. Still, both clubs\u2019 B teams have plenty of good players who\u2019ll be eager to press their claims for more regular inclusion in the first-teams (or a transfer in January). So this tournament has an important role to play in keeping squad harmony intact at both clubs, as well as in bringing them closer to honours. With Leicester, Everton, Stoke and Accrington Stanley already eliminated, and either Manchester City or Manchester United to be frogmarched out tomorrow, the path to the final is starting to clear. For Liverpool a win here would open up the possibility of the club increasing their record number of League Cup hauls, while for Spurs victory would fuel dreams of a return to the glory, glory days of Juande Ramos.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580f8591e4b0219a00d38799\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-25T16:34:43.175Z\">5.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Teams</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Look! Nkoudou makes his first start for Tottenham since his move from Marseille and wouldn\u2019t it be handy if emerged as a source of goals, since Spurs clearly need more of them? Speaking of which, Janssen has been given yet another banjo as he continues his search for a barn door. And look, the lesser-spotted Wimmer is making an appearance! As for Liverpool, it\u2019ll be interesting to see what sort of form Sturridge can muster, and whether Moreno has developed any kind of spatial awareness while meditating on being replaced at left-back by James Milner. It would have been nice to see a start by Ings. Grujic is a talent that needs to be seen more often so watching him could be a nice experience, and the same could be said of Ovie Ejaria, an 18-year-old midfielder who was lured to Liverpool two years ago from Arsenal, whom he joined before even reaching his teens. And then there\u2019s Trent Alexander-Arnold, another 18-year-old and about whom Steven Gerrard once said: \u201cHe<strong> </strong>has a terrific chance of making it as a top professional. He\u2019s quite leggy but he\u2019s got a lovely frame and seems to have all the attributes you need. He has the right attitude and comes from West Derby, home to Melwood. So Trent is another Scouser and apparently, just as I tried to be John Barnes and Steve McMahon, he grew up pretending to be me while playing in the Merseyside parks. He can play as a No6, a holding midfielder, but he\u2019s versatile and I\u2019ve seen him fill various positions.\u201d Tonight it looks like he\u2019ll be at right-back.

  "<p>Eddie Jones could do worse than follow the example of Marshal Ferdinand Foch. It was the French first world war general who coined the classic battleground maxim \u2013 \u201cMy centre is giving way, my right is in retreat; situation excellent. I shall attack\u201d \u2013 that could equally apply to English rugby\u2019s predicament. As his injury list lengthens, Jones needs to introduce a surge of optimism from somewhere.</p> <p>It is clearly unfortunate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/24/maro-itoje-miss-england-autumn-internationals-fracturing-hand\" title=\"\">to have lost Maro Itoje</a>, George Kruis, James Haskell, Jack Nowell and Anthony Watson, all of whom could have been confidently inked into the team against South Africa next month. Dylan Hartley, the captain, has completed less than 160 minutes of competitive rugby since June while Manu Tuilagi, Sam Jones, Jack Clifford, Mike Williams, Will Fraser, Luke Cowan-Dickie and Sam Underhill are also non-runners. The squad of 32 or 33 names to be announced on Wednesday will have a patched-up look around the edges.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/24/maro-itoje-miss-england-autumn-internationals-fracturing-hand\">Maro Itoje to miss England\u2019s autumn internationals after fracturing hand</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jones, having received a fair bit of stick from the clubs after a clutch of players were laid low on his previous training camp in Brighton, is now starting to appreciate how tricky it can be to keep Test players fit in the hurly-burly of the Premiership. That said, there is no necessity to panic. With the exception of the back row he can still field proven internationals throughout his starting XV and also pick a potentially exciting bench. Only if this weekend\u2019s round of Premiership games deprive him of a further half dozen forwards will he begin to feel dangerously exposed.</p> <p>Admittedly, Itoje\u2019s non-availability with a broken hand is a huge loss. It is necessary to go back to a young John Eales to find an emerging back-five forward with such a kaleidoscopic range of skills; Itoje has been the standout non-Kiwi of this rugby year and would undoubtedly have made a back-row impact this autumn. His absence, along with the estimable Kruis, also deprives England\u2019s pack of its steely Saracens heart, such a vital factor under Jones\u2019s stewardship.</p> <p>It will put a considerable onus on Joe Launchbury and Courtney Lawes to exert the same kind of influence and allow some less celebrated team-mates to make the most of their unexpected opportunities.</p> <p>It is here Jones can transform the mood at a stroke. Clive Woodward used to enjoy handing a debut to a player a game or two before people expected it, ensuring an instant reaction from both the player and his team-mates. So far Jones has made his mark by withdrawing players \u2013 Luther Burrell, Teimana Harrison \u2013 prematurely from the fray rather than picking people who instantly prosper. Now is the moment to pick the right bloke from the outset.</p> <p>For me, on the basis that attack can be the best form of defence, that individual should be Nathan Hughes in the No6 jersey, with Chris Robshaw shifting to No7 with licence to disprove Jones\u2019s caustic newspaper observations last year about his openside skills. Hughes is not going to soar quite like Itoje \u2013 the uncapped Josh Beaumont can do that and must be close to his senior debut, probably off the bench \u2013 or cause the same octopus-type problems at the breakdown but he has the dynamic power and mobility to cause South Africa problems in other areas. England need another destructive ball-carrier whose surname is not Vunipola and now the Fiji-reared Hughes is qualified via residency there seems little point ignoring him.</p> <p>I would also be taking a closer look at his club-mate Guy Thompson, dismissed on the grounds of age by Jones before the latest spate of injuries. Thompson is 29, younger than Robshaw and Haskell, and offers something different from alternatives such as Ed Slater and Jackson Wray, with Matt Kvesic, Tom Wood, Luke Wallace and the French-based Steffon Armitage not appearing to suit Jones\u2019s particular requirements. If Harrison was good enough to make the summer tour party he should still be good enough now, regardless of his chastening experience in Sydney. Jones is surely smart enough to realise the odd redemptive carrot works just as effectively as the ever-present stick.</p> <p>Behind the scrum Jones is also fortunate that, in the fit-again Jonny May and Semesa Rokoduguni, he has two wings who can threaten any defence. It does not feel like the best moment to fiddle around unnecessarily in midfield, with George Ford and Owen Farrell playing well enough to justify the retention of their 10/12 axis. In a perfect world there would also be squad places for Danny Cipriani, Christian Wade and Kyle Eastmond but, for now, the Wasps\u2019 trio will have to stay patient. Jones will be hoping another of Foch\u2019s inspirational lines \u2013 \u201cThe most powerful weapon on earth is the human soul on fire\u201d \u2013 resonates with all involved, whether they feature in this squad or not.</p> <p><strong>Predicted England autumn internationals squad:</strong> <strong>Backs</strong> Mike Brown (Harlequins), Alex Goode (Saracens), Jonny May (Gloucester), Semesa Rokoduguni (Bath), Marland Yarde (Harlequins), Elliot Daly (Wasps), Jonathan Joseph (Bath), Henry Slade (Exeter), Ben Te\u2019o (Worcester), Owen Farrell (Saracens), George Ford (Bath), Danny Care (Harlequins), Ben Youngs (Leicester), Dan Robson (Wasps).</p> <p><strong>Forwards</strong> Jamie George (Saracens), Dylan Hartley (Northampton), Tommy Taylor (Wasps), Joe Marler (Harlequins), Matt Mullan (Wasps), Mako Vunipola (Saracens), Dan Cole (Leicester), Paul Hill (Northampton), Kyle Sinckler (Harlequins), Joe Launchbury (Wasps), Courtney Lawes (Northampton), Josh Beaumont (Sale), Charlie Ewels (Bath), Nathan Hughes (Wasps), Chris Robshaw (Harlequins), Teimana Harrison (Northampton), Guy Thompson (Wasps), Billy Vunipola (Saracens), Ben Morgan (Gloucester).</p> <h2>Channel hopping</h2> <p>England is not so blessed with quality wings that Chris Ashton\u2019s departure to Toulon next summer can be instantly shrugged off. The player clearly feels his international ship has sailed under Eddie Jones and the prospect of a fresh challenge will help ease the frustration of his two lengthy disciplinary bans he has had to serve in 2016. If he has the same new lease of life as David Strettle and Nick Abendanon have enjoyed at Clermont his new employers will be delighted. To watch Strettle and Abendanon giving Bordeaux B\u00e8gles the runaround last weekend was to wonder again at the energising properties of French cuisine and the occasional glass of vin rouge.</p> <p>Toulon\u2019s wings do not always receive buckets of ball but, assuming he settles on the Cote d\u2019Azur, we have not heard the last of Ashton as a top-class attacking presence.</p> <h2>And another thing \u2026</h2> <p>The confusion over what does or does not constitute a dangerous tackle continues. Munster\u2019s Keith Earls was sent off on Saturday for a tackle that looked less bad than Matt Toomua\u2019s in Glasgow the previous weekend; the only difference was the tackled player did not assist him by putting an arm down to break his fall. Earls received red, while Toomua was shown yellow. People talk about the letter of the law and the consequence being more important than the act itself but consistency remains frustratingly elusive. In the interests of fairness it would be better for all such \u2018grey area\u2019 tackles to incur a yellow card, with those considered to have committed the worst offences banned in retrospect. It would speed up the game and, hopefully, result in better justice for all.</p>",

  "<p>The Watford chief executive, Scott Duxbury, says the club are treating as \u201cextremely serious\u201d the accusation that they gave falsified financial information to the football authorities, as the controversy looked set to be resolved by an independent commission and, in the event of any wrongdoing being proved, a likely fine.</p> <p>The affair relates to the ownership handover at the club from Giampaolo Pozzo to his son, Gino, in 2014. Watford \u2013 who are ninth in the Premier League \u2013 were in the Championship at the time and Pozzo Jr had to show the English Football League that he had sufficient capital in the bank to comply with his responsibilities.</p> <p>A document was submitted to the EFL in July 2014, purporting to be on behalf of HSBC, one of the world\u2019s biggest banks, which showed Hornets Investment Limited \u2013 the holding company that owns Watford \u2013 had the necessary credit of \u00a37m. But, according to the Daily Telegraph, the document was a fake. The Telegraph reported it had been secured by the Watford executive chairman and non-executive director, Raffaele Riva, who is also a leading executive at Hornets Investment.</p> <p>The EFL has opened a disciplinary investigation into the allegations and Watford, who have brought in an independent firm of solicitors, intend to report back with their findings early next month.

For that to be the case, causation \u2013 or cause and effect \u2013 would surely have be proved. In other words, did the allegedly faked bank letter and subsequent confirmation of Pozzo Jr as the Watford owner lead to a tangible benefit for the club on the field?</p> <p>Riva told the Telegraph that he had asked a trusted associate to help him with the proof of funds letter from a bank.

It is, therefore, plain to them that he had the required \u00a37m in the first place. Why would there have been the need for a forged document?

  "<h2><strong>Preamble</strong></h2> <p><em>Final, Azteca Stadium, Mexico City, Mexico, Sunday 21 June 1970</em></p> <p><strong>It\u2019s beginning to look like Brazil will realise their dream of becoming the first country to win the World Cup three times, and take home the famous Jules Rimet Trophy for keeps.</strong> They\u2019re hot favourites to win this afternoon, and little wonder: en route to the final they\u2019ve scored 15 goals in five matches, beaten the reigning champions England, seen off the ghosts of 1950 by finally defeating Uruguay at a World Cup, and raised the bar to such an extent that their two most memorable moments are misses, for goodness sake, Pel\u00e9 nearly scoring from the halfway line against Czechoslovakia, and freezing the Uruguayan keeper in amber during the semi with an outrageous dummy, rounding him on one side while the ball went t\u2019other, before finally yanking a shot inches wide. Can anyone stop this famous forward five of Pel\u00e9, Rivelino, Tost\u00e3o, G\u00e9rson and Jairzinho?</p> <p><strong>If anyone can, Italy are your men, for the 1934 and 1938 champs are looking to bag Jules Rimet for good as well.</strong> The current European champions eased their way through qualification, with Luigi Riva, a newly crowned Serie A champion with Sardinian minnows Cagliari, scoring seven times. After a quiet start in the group stage, they\u2019ve reached the final after pelting four goals past hosts Mexico and the highly fancied West Germans. The only problem has been keeping midfield maestro Gianni Rivera happy. Coach Ferruccio Valcaregga doesn\u2019t much like the cut of the Milan star\u2019s jib, it would seem, preferring Sandro Mazzola of Internazionale, who it was thought had been brought to Mexico merely as cover for Rivera. When he replaced Rivera at the start of the tournament, so abrasive was the Golden Boy\u2019s response to being dropped that he was nearly sent home. But as things have panned out, Mazzola\u2019s been playing the first half of the knockout games, with Rivera coming on for the second. What a carry-on. And to think Valcaregga is paid to make decisions! It\u2019s a decision of sorts, I suppose, and eight goals in two games suggests it\u2019s working, but you have to wonder how this might pan out now we\u2019re down to the nitty gritty.</p> <p><strong>Whoever plays, this final is being viewed as a battle for the philosophical heart of soccer, the flair and panache of the south Americans versus the wily catenaccio of the Azzurri. </strong>Broad brush strokes, of course - Italy\u2019s eight in the last two matches, again - but it\u2019s not totally unfair. Either way, it\u2019s expected to be a close one, with Brazil fancied to edge it, much as they did against England. Though in fairness the contest would be a damn sight harder to call if it wasn\u2019t being played in this heat and altitude, especially as G\u00e9rson, the brains of Brazil, is on 40 gaspers a day.</p> <p><strong>Valcaregga has made another decision! And it\u2019s to keep that preposterous Mazzola-Rivera <em>staffetta</em></strong> <strong>(relay) policy going: </strong>Enrico Albertosi, Tarcisio Burgnich, Giacinto Facchetti, Mario Bertini, Roberto Rosato, Pierluigi Cera, Angelo Domenghini, Sandro Mazzola, Roberto Boninsegna, Giancarlo De Sisti, Luigi Riva.</p> <p><strong>Brazil, a teamsheet which conjures up so many vivid images it reads like a modernist poem: </strong>Felix, Carlos Alberto, Everaldo, Clodoaldo, Brito, Piazza, Jairzinho, G\u00e9rson, Tost\u00e3o, Pel\u00e9, Rivelino. So much depends on Brazil, glazed with rain water. It\u2019s a humid, oppressive afternoon.</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>The highest of high noons: 12 midday.</p> <h2>Buildup</h2> <p><strong>A heady atmosphere in the Azteca, then, which is filled to the brim, 112,000 people. </strong>Sailing off into the ether are four humongous beachball-balloons, one bedecked in the blue-and-green of Brazil, another in the Italian tricolore and therefore totally out of sync with the national team strip, and a couple with huge Mexico 70 logos stamped on them. That brazen branding\u2019s going to give someone at Fifa ideas.</p> <p><strong>The players line up to get their photos taken, Brazil looking grim faced, the weight of expectation weighing heavily. </strong>The scene quickly descends into mayhem. Bedlam bedlam bedlam. The pitch fills with some official-looking folk, and very many unofficial-looking folk. An awful lot of photographers and assorted hangers-on. The World Cup final\u2019s going to kick off in less than 60 seconds, for goodness sake, will you all please bugger off!</p> <p><strong>Amid the madness, </strong><strong>Pel\u00e9</strong><strong> swooshes around warming up, completing several little circles to make one big, baroque, semi-circular swoop of the field, a one-man whirling waltzer.</strong> Attempt to avoid clich\u00e9s all you like, but just try watching him move without picking up a samba earworm. Speaking of resorting to stereotypes, up the other end of the field, the Italians are huddled around several severe gentlemen in trenchcoats, looking for all the world like they\u2019re striking an import-export agreement which won\u2019t necessarily involve passing through any of the major designated ports.</p> <h2>First half</h2> <p><strong>Handshakes between captains Giacinto Facchetti and Carlos Alberto, the latter winning the toss and insisting the teams switch direction. And with the field quickly swept of clingers-on, we\u2019re off!</strong> Boninsegna gets the ball rolling. It\u2019s not long before Italy lose the ball and Jairzinho is skittering down the right. Pel\u00e9 goes down looking for a free kick, but he\u2019s full of sauce.</p> <p><strong>2 min: </strong>Pel\u00e9\u2019s full of energy, too, and speedily exchanges passes with Tost\u00e3o down the inside-left channel. For a second it looks like he\u2019ll break clear, but Bertini is covering and passes back to the keeper. Italy waste no time in tearing down the right themselves, the ball eventually being shuttled inside to Riva, who unleashes a rising heatseeker towards goal. What a shot! Felix tips over magnificently. The corner is an easy one for the keeper. What a start, though.</p> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Bertini hacks down Pel\u00e9 as the latter chases after a sliderule Carlos Alberto pass down the right. What glorious hoodlummery. Free kick. G\u00e9rson looks to bend it, but slips as he takes, and his low left-to-right curler is easily gathered by Albertosi.</p> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Everaldo hares down the left and sends a daisycutter to the near post. Albertosi gathers, but looks to have carried the ball over the touchline for a corner. It\u2019s not given, though. This is a high-octane start, and Brazil are almost immediately coming back at Italy, down the middle at pace after Jairzinho picks up a loose Domenghini pass from the right wing. He\u2019s clattered to the floor on the edge of the D by Facchetti. Another free kick.</p> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> Pel\u00e9 dummies. Rivelino blooters the set piece onto the roof. Haw.</p> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Mazzola exchanges passes with Riva to advance down the inside left, but his eventual shot is weak and wafts into the arms of Felix.</p> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> Carlos Alberto floats a cross into the Italian area from the right. At the far post, Albertosi should let it fly out for a goal kick but panics and punches behind. He\u2019s not the only one not quite on his game; Rivelino, after that free kick, now hits a corner miles into the sky and straight out of play on the other side.</p> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Rivelino slips on the turf and skitters across it on his arse. An undignified climax to an undistinguished start.</p> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> A bit of space for Riva down the left, but with men in the middle he has a rush of blood and shoots speculatively from the corner of the box. That\u2019s not beating Felix from there.</p> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Italy have settled into this a little bit now. Domenghini tries to score from the best part of 40 yards while out on the touchline, some respect please for the love of god. The shot pings off poor Wilson Piazza\u2019s coupon and out for a corner on the left.</p> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> Mazzola slides the corner back to Facchetti, who floats the ball into the box. It\u2019s punched clear by a jabbering Felix, but only to Mazzola, whose first-time shot is blocked and balloons out towards De Sisti, who is clattered by Pel\u00e9. Free kick, 35 yards out, just to the left of goal. Brazil line up a wall, but there\u2019s a laughably large gap in their defence to its right. Mazzola floats the ball over the head of the lurking Boninsegna, and right onto the forehead of the onrushing Riva, who really should score from a slight angle, 12 yards out. Instead his effort loops over the bar. That\u2019s an appalling miss, really, and nearly as bad as Brazil\u2019s defending.</p> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> Clodoaldo misjudges a high pass down the right, allowing Domenghini to make good down the wing. He rolls the ball inside to Boninsegna, the Italians three on three. But with Riva to his left, he decides to tiptoe through two challenges on the edge of the box and his glory run is halted by Piazza, who tackles him with his big arse.</p> <p><strong>18 min: GOAL!!! Brazil 1-0 Italy</strong> Tost\u00e3o drops a shoulder down the left and whips a cross in towards Pel\u00e9, but it\u2019s headed back and out for a throw by the stooping Facchetti. The Italians do not heed the warning. Receiving Tost\u00e3o\u2019s throw, Rivelino leans back and loops a high cross into the box, Pel\u00e9 getting the jump on Burgnich and clattering a majestic header into the bottom right, Albertosi late to react. That\u2019s Brazil\u2019s 100th goal in World Cups. Not bad timing, eh? Pel\u00e9 is lifted into the air by Jairzinho\u2019s bearhug, and punches the sky three times. You\u2019ll see that celebration again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7dce70daa325bf087ee988e7195c9fb9fbfb715\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7dce70daa325bf087ee988e7195c9fb9fbfb715/0_25_5322_3192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pel\u00e9\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pel\u00e9, right, leaps above Tarcisio Burgnich to head Brazil in front.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mondadori/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><br></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b13be83f4a5942126434836d4b3ed33396d9c1c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b13be83f4a5942126434836d4b3ed33396d9c1c5/18_0_1386_832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pel\u00e9 celebrates Brazil\u2019s opener.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pel\u00e9 celebrates Brazil\u2019s opener.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>19 min:</strong> Hilariously, and preposterously, Brazil make no effort whatsoever to regroup for the kick off, and are all buggering around deep in their own half when Italy get the ball moving again. The ball\u2019s flicked out to Domenghini, who powers down the wing, cuts inside, and hammers a low shot towards the bottom right, Felix doing well to claim. That was staggeringly inept.</p> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> G\u00e9rson sends a crossfield ball to the right for Carlos Alberto, who ten yards from the touchline and with the angle preposterous, decides to go for the spectacular. He achieves it: a spectacularly awful slice off the side of his boot straight behind and into the crowd. He has the chutzpah to look down and blame his footwear. At least there\u2019s plenty of time left in which to showcase better technique, Carlos.</p> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> After a period of sterile Brazilian possession, a cock-up. Everaldo passes back down the left wing to Piazza, who sidefoots inside to Brito. Brito attempts to flick a casual one back to the left for Clodoaldo, but Riva nips in to block the lazy pass and hare after it down the middle. Felix comes out of his box, wallops clear, and waves angrily at his defence. Don\u2019t. Do. That. Again. Or else!</p> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> It\u2019s raining, the sun\u2019s gone, it\u2019s humid. Bah. Domenghini embarks on a Power Run down the inside-left channel. He\u2019s upended by Jair, but the referee waves play on, perhaps thinking the Italian had slipped over on the greasy turf. Then Mazzola, from the left, lifts a diagonal ball towards Riva at the far post, but Piazza is ahead of the striker, rises to head, dummies, and lets the ball bounce out of play. Italy have finally woken up.</p> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Free kick to Brazil, 20 yards out on the left, level with the left-hand side of the area, after Bertini scythes through the back of Rivelino. The Italians line up a five-man wall. Rivelino shapes to have a shot, but sprints straight past the ball. Pel\u00e9 rushes in and chips a perfectly weighted ball after Rivelino. The five Italians spin and turn then crash to the floor like pissed-up circus performers. Rivelino, on the run, shapes to whip a cross into the middle, where G\u00e9rson, Jairzinho and Tost\u00e3o are lining up to belt home from six yards. But he hesitates for a fatal microsecond, allowing the ball to skid off the turf and out for a goal kick, despite a desperate late lunge. Such a clever pass from Pel\u00e9, though, threaded along a route to the left of the wall and the right of Rivelino, inviting the cross.</p> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Italy so nearly cleave Brazil in two. From the centre circle, Domenghini slides the ball forward to Riva, who with his back to goal 30 yards out plays a first-time flick onward to Mazzola, and gets clattered by Piazza for his trouble. The referee waves play on, as Mazzola is clear of the backtracking Tost\u00e3o and advances towards the area, but on the edge of the D, Brito slides in majestically. He\u2019s not letting that ball get past.</p> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Pel\u00e9 goes on a meander down the inside-right channel, and is upended by Burgnich. He rolls over on his side once, then executes two head-first roly-polies, all in one smooth Olympic-gymnast-standard movement, a technique that comes with a difficulty tariff of 6.0. Applause. The Italian is shown the yellow card, and doesn\u2019t seem to care very much. Brazil\u2019s trainer trots on with bucket and sponge to attend to Pel\u00e9, but is angrily told to chip off by the referee, who furiously flaps his hands in the dismissive style. Pel\u00e9 is still on the floor moaning, but there\u2019s naff all wrong with him, the big gurner.</p> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Rivelino\u2019s resulting free kick finds the top-left corner. Of the stand behind the goal. That\u2019s the worst free kick ever taken in a World Cup final, surely. Rivelino looks down at his wet boot, and the soft turf, but is fooling nobody.</p> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Mazzola sends a long, speculative ball towards the Brazilian box from the halfway line. Riva, his back to goal, is tugged back by Piazza on the edge of the area. Free kick to Italy, on the right-hand edge of the D.</p> <p><strong>30 min: </strong>Bertini knocks it left to Riva, who skelps it straight at the Brazilian wall, and makes a desperate claim for a handball penalty. No dice. The ball comes back to Bertini, who lifts a fairly aimless snapshot high and wide right.</p> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> Italy are snapping away at the heels of the Brazilians. Boninsegna slides in on G\u00e9rson and offers him his hand by way of apology, but the Brazilian\u2019s not having it. Brazil look slightly shaken, though. Boninsegna turns Piazza 25 yards out then fizzes a low ball just right of goal. The not-always-dependable Felix had it covered all the way.</p> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> From the restart Felix reverts to type, throwing an awkward ball out wide to Carlos Alberto, who sees it balloon over his head for a throw to Italy. As the sun comes out, Mazzola takes up possession from the throw and slides the ball left to De Sisti, who draws three men before twinkletoeing the ball back inside to Mazzola. From a standing start, Mazzola turns on the burners and dances past three challenges, flicks a quick one-two off De Sisti to his left, then powers into the box and takes a shot from a tight angle. But Brito and G\u00e9rson have crowded round him, and the ball\u2019s blocked out for a corner. From the set piece, Felix, mopping up his own mess, sends a punch almost to the halfway line.</p> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Some space for Clodoaldo down the right. He whips a cross into the box and finds Pel\u00e9, eight yards out, but O Rei heads over, and he\u2019s offside anyway. The king\u2019s crown slips.</p> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> A mad scramble on the edge of the Italian area. Jairzinho bombs down the middle and attempts a one-two with Tost\u00e3o. On receiving the return, he\u2019s stopped mid-flight by Burgnich\u2019s sliding tackle, but still manages to nick the ball down the inside-left for Pel\u00e9, who immediately flicks one back into the middle for Tost\u00e3o. The forward breaks into the box before hitting a weak cross-cum-shot in the general direction of the left-hand corner and the onrushing Jairzinho. Italy hack clear.</p> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Rivelino drops a shoulder to glide past Bertini down the inside right. As he cuts inside, Bertini is so wrongfooted he inadvertently performs the splits across the skiddy turf. That might make a couple of bobbles on the pitch. Rivelino pokes an awful effort miles left of the target, and as high as a house to boot. He gets pelters from the bench. A full and frank exchange of views ensues. His shooting has been hilariously poor so far.</p> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> Riva sends a weak daisycutter a couple of yards wide right. For all Italy\u2019s intricate build-up play, Felix hasn\u2019t had much to do.</p> <p><strong>37 min: FARCICAL GOAL!!! Brazil 1-1 Italy.</strong> Pel\u00e9 looks to turn Burgnich in the Italian area, but the defender\u2019s having none of it, banging an interception upfield with no little authority. Everaldo chases back down the Italian right flank to collect, turning the ball inside to Piazza, who floats a needlessly dangerous chip across his back line. It drops towards Brito, who has Riva nearby but still enough time to deal with the problem. He doesn\u2019t, though. He heads inside to Clodoaldo who, unaware Boninsegna is lurking, attempts an adventurous blind backflick out towards Piazza, still on the Brazil left. Boninsegna intercepts and, though never quite in control, barrels clear down the inside right. Brito is coming over to meet him from the middle, while Felix races rashly out of his box. Cue komik kutz on the edge of the D, and proof that Brazil really did learn nothing from all that fannying around on 23 minutes. Brito\u2019s sliding challenge, coming in towards Boninsegna from the left, is weak and mistimed, the ball clattering off his heel and into the middle. His useless contribution has also had the effect of taking Felix out of the game, the keeper having turned up to the melee a millisecond too late. Felix puts the brakes on and attempts to change direction, but he knows the game is up. Boninsegna scampers after the ball and, although Riva gets in the way with a view to nabbing the goal himself, wraps his left leg around his cheeky team-mate to hook the ball into the bottom right of the empty net. He races off with arms out wide before being smothered by Domenghini and Mazzola. Riva doesn\u2019t join in, the mardy get.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e85853ffc8241bc38a0e9e1535618ad54aa77c91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e85853ffc8241bc38a0e9e1535618ad54aa77c91/0_359_5390_3235/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roberto Boninsegna, centre, hunts down the loose ball after the Brazil goalkeeper Felix\u2019s challenge, before equalising for Italy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roberto Boninsegna, centre, hunts down the loose ball after the Brazil goalkeeper Felix\u2019s challenge, before equalising for Italy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario De Biasi/Mondadori Portfolio via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>38 min:</strong> Brazil try to respond immediately, Rivelino bursting down the left and winning a free kick, then swinging a dangerous-looking ball down the corridor of uncertainty before Albertosi punches clear.</p> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> The sun is shimmering now. Mazzola instigates a gorgeous sweeping Italian move from deep, jigging his way out of trouble near his own area down the left before clipping a ball out to Facchetti, who shuttles the ball up the flank to Boninsegna. Facing back down the pitch, he draws two Brazilian players and, with the full knowledge he\u2019s going to be cleaned out by Carlos Alberto, plays a reverse ball down the wing to Riva, who makes good for the box and wins a corner off Brito, the defender doing well to stop the striker taking a shot. Back upfield, Carlos Alberto and Boninsegna are both receiving treatment, the former having been clocked in the coupon upon clattering the latter. The pair respectfully apologise to each other like adults, proving that this game really can be beautiful even when the participants are wantonly fouling each other.</p> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> Nothing comes of the corner, despite Mazzola\u2019s promptings. Brazil flood upfield, Rivelino threatening to break clear down the right. Now it\u2019s Pel\u00e9\u2019s turn to prompt, and he sets up the onrushing G\u00e9rson, who screws a poor effort wide left.</p> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Domenghini launches a low, rising shot straight at Felix, who nearly dives all around it, but eventually gathers midway through the pudding course.</p> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Rivelino is booked for a petulant backflick on Bertini, who has come from behind to whip the ball off his toe. Bertini holds his thigh. For a second, it looks like the referee is going to show the Brazilian a red \u2013 the card\u2019s in his hand, visible to all \u2013 but he ostentatiously flashes yellow to all four stands. But then lhe ets Rivelino see the red card, pointing to the bench as if to say: \u201cOne more like that, son, and you\u2019ll see this one too.\u201d</p> <p><strong>HALF TIME: Brazil 1-1 Italy, though it probably should be Brazil 2-1 Italy!</strong> So how\u2019s this for a farcical end to the half? Despite Rivelino\u2019s booking for retaliation, the referee has awarded a free kick to Brazil for the original Bertini challenge. Very strange. From the left touchline, G\u00e9rson loops a high ball into the area. It drops over the head of an out-of-position Burgnich, who falls backwards as the ball lands at Pel\u00e9\u2019s feet, ten yards out, level with the far post and with only the keeper to beat. But instead of playing on, Pel\u00e9 throws his hands up in disgust. Why\u2019s he pausing?! It\u2019s half-time, that\u2019s why! The referee\u2019s blown his whistle early \u2013 45 minutes aren\u2019t quite up \u2013 and Pel\u00e9 is understandably beside himself with the rage! He still manages to convert, despite the red mist, flicking the ball into the bottom-left corner and clattering Cera, coming across to cover, on the shoe while he\u2019s at it. Cera gets right up in Pel\u00e9\u2019s grille to remonstrate, pointing at his instep, and Pel\u00e9\u2019s suddenly surrounded by a raging sea of blue shirts. Nobody\u2019s got a clue what\u2019s going on, until the referee, ball wedged under his armpit, strides through the melee and wanders off the pitch for a fag and a cup of tea.</p> <h2>Second half</h2> <p><strong>And we\u2019re off again! </strong>No changes, which is something of a surprise as Valcareggi was expected to continue with this <em>staffetta</em> malarkey, and replace Mazzola with Rivera at the break. Understandable, perhaps, because Mazzola had an excellent first half, but remember this policy saw Italy score four times in both quarters and semis, so it\u2019s a brave decision. Brazil set us in motion again.</p> <p><strong>46 min: </strong>Valcareggi\u2019s nearly vindicated from the off, as Mazzola picks the ball up deep and flicks the ball to Domenghini, who slides a long pass up the inside-left channel for Boninsegna. The forward shuttles it on immediately, into the path of Mazzola who has kept surging forward. Everaldo steps in to poke back to Felix, just as it looked like Mazzola would break into the box.</p> <p><strong>47 min: </strong>Carlos Alberto is sent striding clear on the overlap. He fires a ball straight through the six-yard box. Pel\u00e9 slides in at the far post, but misses the ball and clatters his wrist on the post.</p> <p><strong>50 min: </strong>G\u00e9rson clips a high ball down the middle, into the Italian area. Pel\u00e9 stumbles as he tussles with Facchetti, then races off after the referee, miming a tug on his sleeve. The big man\u2019s bopping around with the heat on. It really wasn\u2019t much of a challenge.</p> <p><strong>52 min: </strong>Burgnich upends Pel\u00e9 in the roughhouse fashion, 30 yards out on the right. Rivelino takes what Hugh Johns on ITV calls a \u201cfast-bowler\u2019s run-up\u201d and batters a rising, swerving shot towards the right of goal. Albertosi parries it with strong arms, and Italy hack clear. Brazil come straight back at them. G\u00e9rson goes on a Power Jog down the inside right. His one-two with Tost\u00e3o on the edge of the box doesn\u2019t quite come off, but the ball loops towards Pel\u00e9, who is obstructed by Burgnich as the Italian attempts an overhead clearance. Indirect free kick! Or, as the caption has it: <em>tiro indirecto</em>!</p> <p><strong>53 min: </strong>On ITV, Bobby Moore thinks it should be a penalty for dangerous play. But t<em>iro indirecto</em> it is. Pel\u00e9 feathers the ball to the right for G\u00e9rson, who blooters hopelessly into the Italian wall. Insult is nearly added to injury as Facchetti breaks upfield along the left. The ball\u2019s funnelled inside and across the pitch to Domenghini, bombing in acres down the right. He hammers a shot towards the bottom-left corner. Everaldo comes across, sticks a boot out, and nearly deflects the thing into the bottom right. That was inches away. Domenghini waves both of his fists, then pumps them, in frustration. Rosato heads a weak effort over the bar from the resulting corner.</p> <p><strong>55 min: </strong>G\u00e9rson is looking increasingly dangerous, a testament to his daily multipack cheroot regime. Again he bursts down the inside right, again a one-two with Tost\u00e3o doesn\u2019t quite come off. He was very nearly clean through on goal there.</p> <p><strong>56 min: </strong>Rivelino twists on the ball through 360 degrees, takes a couple of steps down the inside right channel, drifts inside, then hoicks an effort over the bar. Italy go up the other end through the increasingly attack-minded Mazzola, who has a sortie down the inside-right flank himself and shovels a poor shot miles over from distance. This is good to-and-fro stuff, and not wholly predictable, even if Brazil are gaining a little momentum.</p> <p><strong>58 min: </strong>Rivelino begins a determined sashay towards the Italian box, drifting in from the left. He\u2019s scythed down by Bertini, who cuts his feet off with one cynical swish from behind. Pel\u00e9\u2019s free kick from a central position 25 yards out is a new Worst Of All Time, some going given Rivelino\u2019s attempt half an hour earlier, shooting off at a 45-degree angle towards the top-right corner of the stand behind the goal. A place-kicker in rugby would struggle to set a ball off along that flight. Ee, he\u2019s a poor lad.</p> <p><strong>59 min: RIVELINO HITS THE BAR! </strong>Another free kick for Brazil, just outside the area, after Facchetti linked arms to do-se-do Jairzinho out of a one-two with Tost\u00e3o. <em>Tiro indirecto!</em> From the edge of the D, G\u00e9rson knocks the ball to the right for Rivelino, who twangs the crossbar with a rising thunderer. Goal kick. Bobby Moore reckons it\u2019s the first time Rivelino has used his right foot all tournament. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonder he doesn\u2019t use it more often!\u201d Especially the way he\u2019d been shooting up to this point.</p> <p><strong>61 min: </strong>Brazil are becoming the dominant force now. Pel\u00e9 looks to dance round Burgnich down the right and into the area, but he\u2019s barged off the ball and is appealing to the referee by waving his hands in the air as he falls backwards. <em>Tiro directo!</em> Rivelino batters it over the bar and is battered himself by Riva as he\u2019s taking it. Another <em>tiro directo!</em> Riva looks astonished and disgusted at the same time, an Italian speciality. Rivelino skelps the second effort into the wall, a trick G\u00e9rson repeats with the loose ball.</p> <p><strong>63 min: </strong>An increasingly rare sojourn upfield for Italy as Boninsegna finds space down the left and loops a cross to the far post for Riva, who bangs a header into Everaldo\u2019s back from a tight angle, a couple of yards out. The corner\u2019s met by Mazzola, whose header sails along a gentle parabola towards Felix. The keeper skips into the air in the style of a morris dancer after one mead too many, and punches a feeble effort a couple of yards to his right. Fortunately Carlos Alberto is on hand to sweep up. \u201cWhat an incredible man to have behind you if you\u2019re a defender in this brilliant Brazilian side,\u201d notes a tinder-dry Hugh Johns.</p> <p><strong>65 min: </strong>G\u00e9rson has the run of the middle of the park. He\u2019s been running the show since half time, only moving upfield since the restart, after which the Italians have had no time to formulate one of their trademark defensive lockdowns. Clever G\u00e9rson. Clever Brazil. He sets a move in motion down the right, Clodoaldo feeding Carlos Alberto, who whips a cross towards Tost\u00e3o at the far post. The forward can\u2019t control his header, which screws well wide left.</p> <p><strong>66 min: THIS HAS BEEN COMING!!! Brazil 2-1 Italy. </strong>G\u00e9rson has the run of the park all right. His beautiful reverse ball sets Everaldo on a probe down the inside left. Jairzinho takes up possession and makes for the edge of the D. He\u2019s tracked by Facchetti, who sticks a toe in. The ball breaks to G\u00e9rson, who has been loitering in the middle. He takes two little taps to the left, before twisting and walloping a mid-height cross-shot into the right-hand side of the net. Boninsegna slid in with a tackle, while Albertosi flung himself across goal, but neither made it in time. G\u00e9rson races off with arms aloft, a cheesy grin across his boat. Reserve keeper Ado leads a delegation off the bench to celebrate the achievement. Brazil are 24 minutes away from becoming world football\u2019s first three-time champions!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e9e69a16fdc0e2269863c37955432dfcbb03b42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e9e69a16fdc0e2269863c37955432dfcbb03b42/0_286_2080_1248/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rivelino (11) embraces goalscorer G\u00e9rson celebrate after Brazil\u2019s second goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rivelino (11) embraces goalscorer G\u00e9rson celebrate after Brazil\u2019s second goal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PLP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>67 min: </strong>Straight from kick off, Domenghini is brought down by Everaldo along the right touchline, 12 yards from the byline. The Italian gets up and attempts to beat Felix at his near post with an outrageous attempt. The effort\u2019s outrageous all right, sliced straight out of play, ten yards to the right of goal. He walks back upfield with his head hung low, abjectly defeated and humiliated. Pel\u00e9\u2019s reign as taker of Worst Free Kick Of All Time has lasted all of nine minutes.</p> <p><strong>68 min: </strong>The stunning G\u00e9rson eats up most of the pitch as he scampers down the inside right. He rolls a pass inside to Tost\u00e3o, who attempts to turn Facchetti but fails and executes a rather embarrassing dive instead. Italy move upfield through Domenghini, who is checked by Pel\u00e9. He responds by shoving the Brazilian in the chest. Pel\u00e9 falls backwards like he\u2019s catching a cannonball, then rather absurdly grabs his left shin as he hits the ground. The ref clearly considers this a whole load of nonsense, and ostentatiously refuses to allow Pel\u00e9 to receive any treatment, ordering the bald guy with the bucket and sponge back off the field for the second time. And just like before, Pel\u00e9\u2019s soon back on his feet again. Good old ref.</p> <p><strong>69 min: </strong>G\u00e9rson has been brilliant since the restart, having kept his cards close to his chest for so long, though whether he\u2019s within his rights to attempt to score from 40 yards now is a moot point.</p> <p><strong>70 min: </strong>Domenghini leaves a leg in as Pel\u00e9 glides past. Pel\u00e9 flips himself miles into the air, a triple pike with salchow and a difficulty tariff of 34. This is gloriously petulant behaviour all round. The referee can\u2019t be bothered with any of it, and simply gestures that they\u2019re to get up and stop behaving like a couple of spoilt brats.</p> <p><strong>71 min: SURELY THE CLINCHER!!! Brazil 3-1 Italy. </strong>From the resulting free kick, just to the left of the centre circle, G\u00e9rson left-foot-wands a raking crossfield ball into the area towards Pel\u00e9, level with the right-hand post. Burgnich is completely lost. And beaten. He turns around to see Pel\u00e9 rise above him. Pel\u00e9 plants a header down and across the face of the six-yard box. Jairzinho races in and thighs the ball into the bottom-left corner, evading the desperate lunges of Cera and Albertosi. He tries to finish with a flourish, but his wild hoof becomes a fresh-air swipe, and the ball makes its own way in, almost apologetically. That\u2019s a goal in every game of the finals for the Botafogo striker, who races off in the arms-aloft G\u00e9rsonian style, before sinking to his knees in prayer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9566c004e9186709fc47242e525fe7c3dc2f5561\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9566c004e9186709fc47242e525fe7c3dc2f5561/0_0_4500_2701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jairzinho\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jairzinho celebrates after walking the ball into the net for his side\u2019s third goal, making him the first player to score a goal in every game.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rolls Press/Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2345620fc4bc5e0c7434d9182139b79f11304fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2345620fc4bc5e0c7434d9182139b79f11304fe/0_0_4159_2495/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jairzinho slides on to his knees as his team-mates rush to join him.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jairzinho slides on to his knees as his team-mates rush to join him.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>72 min: </strong>To illustrate the ragged mental state of the normally impervious Italians, as they kick off, six of them are loitering around the centre spot, like folk waiting for the bus home. Perhaps they want to get on the bus home. They look broken. This has been a G\u00e9rson masterclass. He attempts to replicate his goal by launching another left-footed stinger from the edge of the area, but it\u2019s straight at Albertosi.</p> <p><strong>74 min: </strong>G\u00e9rson walks through the centre circle with the ball at his feet. We\u2019ve got to the stage where nobody even bothers to challenge him.</p> <p><strong>75 min: </strong>Rivelino is checked by De Sisti on the left-hand edge of the area. Free kick. Before it can be taken, a limping Bertini falls in the centre circle and is replaced by Juliano, the first substitution in any World Cup final. G\u00e9rson taps the free kick to the right for Pel\u00e9 to embarrass himself with a witless blooter that\u2019s high and miles wide right.</p> <p><strong>76 min: </strong>Mazzola, so quiet this half, turns on the burners down the inside left, and attempts a one-two on the edge of the area with Riva, but the striker can\u2019t control. Mazzola\u2019s hands rise towards his temples in impotent frustration, though his irritation surely isn\u2019t anything on that of Rivera, still tethered to the bench.</p> <p><strong>78 min: </strong>G\u00e9rson slides Rivelino clear into the left-hand side of the area. He takes a first-time hack at the ball, screwing it well left of the target.</p> <p><strong>79 min: </strong>Mazzola cuts in from the right and feeds Boninsegna, who turns and looks for the bottom left from the edge of the D. It\u2019s accurate, but without power. Felix saves comfortably, which is a phrase for the ages. Brazil break upfield. Tost\u00e3o pokes Pel\u00e9 clear into the area. Pel\u00e9 should score, but his sidefoot towards the right-hand side of the net is smothered brilliantly by the desperate Albertosi. The flag\u2019s up, so none of this counts, a real shame for the keeper, who\u2019d just won a personal showdown with the best player in the world.</p> <p><strong>80 min: </strong>The last chance for Italy to get back into this match, perhaps, is squandered. Juliano, from a position down the inside right, scoops a clever pass forward towards Mazzola, who is screaming for the ball in space, 25 yards from goal in the centre. He turns, and has time to shoot, but takes a second too long and is forced to drift to the right and clip a cross into the mix instead. There\u2019s a brief stramash involving Riva and Boninsegna, the latter eventually thrashing a wild effort miles over from the left-hand side of the box, but by then the Brazilians were swarming around and the door of opportunity which had opened momentarily for Mazzola had long been slammed shut.</p> <p><strong>83 min: </strong>A few passes in the Brazilian half for Italy, but Riva and Boninsegna are far too ponderous. Brazil show them how it\u2019s done, Everaldo springing forward on a no-nonsense run and nearly getting in a shot on goal from a tight angle down the left. He wins a corner, planting his studs into the keeper\u2019s nut as he does so.</p> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> As Albertosi receives a wet sponge to the head, Boninsegna is replaced by Rivera. So much for the half-time <em>staffetta</em>.</p> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Rivera gets his first meaningful touch, 25 yards from goal. He drops a shoulder past G\u00e9rson, but Everaldo is quickly across to get a foot in. Six minutes for the European Player of the Year with his side two down, what chance does he have?</p> <p><strong>86 min: THE ICING ON THE CAKE, THE BOW ON THE BOX, THE CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT! Brazil 4-1 Italy.</strong> What a thing of beauty this is, nothing short of a masterclass, football\u2019s pinnacle finally reached, Brazil planting the flag. The Italian substitute Juliano hares down the right, but Tost\u00e3o takes the ball off him like candy from a baby suffering from heat exhaustion and altitude sickness despite only being in the pram for 11 minutes. Tost\u00e3o dispatches the ball back to Brito, who rolls it forward to Clodoaldo. The ball\u2019s clipped in a short-range triangle, first Pel\u00e9, then G\u00e9rson, then back to Clodoaldo \u2013 cue TV caption \u2019<strong>41</strong> - who drops and raises his shoulders like a laughing policeman, tying Rivera, Domenghini, De Sisti and Juliano up in knots. He strokes the ball wide left to Rivelino who, inside his own half, curls a pinpoint pass down the line to Jairzinho. Just ahead of the box, the striker cuts inside past Italian captain Facchetti, then clips the ball across Cera to Pel\u00e9, facing goal in front of the D. Burgnich closes him down, but Tost\u00e3o \u2013 who\u2019s made it all the way upfield after starting the move and is now behind Burgnich, also facing Pel\u00e9 \u2013 gives the King the eyebrows to the Brazilian right. Pel\u00e9 takes the hint and rolls a perfect ball out wide; it sits up, allowing Carlos Alberto to evade the despairing lunge of Rosato, who has fruitlessly attempted to come across and block, and skelp it into the bottom corner past Albertosi. Only two outfield Brazilians were not involved in that move \u2013 Everaldo and Piazza. With a beautiful symmetry, only two Italians, Mazzola and Riva, were completely out of the picture and can therefore wash their hands of it. God almighty, what a move, what a strike, what a final statement to make in a World Cup!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28a229511dae33f7c415e50156f5a889b0809583\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28a229511dae33f7c415e50156f5a889b0809583/99_0_2801_1681/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carlos Alberto, right, scores Brazil\u2019s fourth goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carlos Alberto, right, scores Brazil\u2019s fourth goal at the end of a wonderful team move.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7754866fdcb82fb8dd0118a9eb1a884b235da640\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7754866fdcb82fb8dd0118a9eb1a884b235da640/0_141_2848_1708/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carlos Alberto celebrates.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carlos Alberto celebrates his strike.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6ce6d3597640b78f88020973ed205a9a7171d98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6ce6d3597640b78f88020973ed205a9a7171d98/0_413_2320_1391/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brazilian players\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brazilian players celebrate after the goal which finished Italy off.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPH</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>87 min: </strong>As the Brazilians cavort behind Italy\u2019s goal, the Mexican television caption \u2013 <strong>ANOTADOR! SCORER! *4 CARLOS ALBERTO</strong> \u2013 washes out the entire picture. It\u2019s almost as though we\u2019ve reached the end of the reel, this is the end, we can go no further, Brazil have finished off football as well as Italy. Where else can the story be taken from there?</p> <p><strong>88 min: </strong>Carlos Alberto is surrounded by photographers \u2013 on the pitch! Finally they bugger off and we restart. Rivera has a resigned shot which Felix swallows up without fuss. Pel\u00e9 sends another ball goalwards from the halfway line, but this time it\u2019s a gentle backpass. Rivelino goes on a determined run down the inside-left channel and is upended when he makes the box by Juliano. If this was 0-0, that\u2019d be a penalty, but the referee decides to show Italy some mercy. Brazil deserve to win, and have been so good during the second half that the three-goal margin doesn\u2019t particularly flatter them. And yet this excellent Italian side doesn\u2019t deserve to be spanked in the biggest match of all by a margin of four.</p> <p><strong>90 min: </strong>There\u2019s been plenty of bloody awful shooting in this match, and perhaps the most egregious hack has been saved for last, a Domenghini shank which nestles in row Z, but only after rebounding from the seats behind. The crowd refuse to give the souvenir back. Time\u2019s up, but the referee refuses to blow until a ball\u2019s on the pitch. This is farcical. Eventually a new orb is presented to him. He hands it to Rivelino to give to Felix.</p> <p><strong>90 min +2: </strong>This is bedlam. Now the original ball has been dispatched back onto the field of play! One fan pops out of the stand and goes on a speedy skitter down the Brazilian right, which is better than some of the Italians have managed. Felix restarts the game and Rivera nearly takes his ankles out with a petulant lunge. The ball\u2019s hoicked upfield, in the general environs of another encroaching punter who\u2019s sporting a sombrero and poncho. \u00a1Arriba! At which point referee Rudi Glockner raises both arms ...</p> <p><strong>IT\u2019S OVER!!! BRAZIL ARE CHAMPIONS OF THE WORLD FOR THE THIRD TIME, AND WILL GET TO KEEP THE JULES RIMET TROPHY!!! Brazil 4-1 Italy. </strong>Within seconds of the final whistle, Pel\u00e9 is mobbed. Hundreds of fans are on the field. Firecrackers crack their fire. Pel\u00e9 is lifted shoulder high. He\u2019s already been divested of his shirt. But someone does give him one of those sombreros to wedge onto his noggin, so it\u2019s swings and roundabouts when it comes to wardrobe inventory. This has quickly descended into a rare old brouhaha. But there\u2019s Carlos Alberto lifting the glistening Jules Rimet trophy to the sky.

One asks about the monstrosity looming over the city and is told the truth. \u201cIt\u2019s a hotel that they\u2019ve been building for years.\u201d This being the USSR, there is a KGB informant in the group. He upbraids the guide: \u201cComrade, you have cast aspersions on the efficiency of Soviet industry. Don\u2019t let it happen again!\u201d Sure enough, on the next tour, the same question comes up. \u201cWhat is that concrete tower?\u201d asks one of the tourists. \u201cI have no idea,\u201d replies the guide. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t there yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>The story captures the way communist central planning combined ineffectiveness and insensitivity to the environment. The Soviet Union was covered in monstrosities that took years to build and then looked so incongruous they might have landed from outer space. Authoritarian regimes can build capriciously.

The two existing runways at Heathrow were imposed using executive powers drafted for wartime expediency. Different governments have wanted to add a third one for 70 years and been thwarted by peacetime politics. On Tuesday, Theresa May\u2019s government declared that it, too, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/25/zac-goldsmith-to-resign-as-tory-mp-after-heathrow-go-ahead\" title=\"\">intends to expand Heathrow</a>, but there will be more consultation, more process.</p> <p>The underlying tensions have not changed. There are good economic arguments for boosting capacity at an aviation hub near the capital. There are compelling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/18/climate-change-airport-expansion-heathrow\" title=\"\">environmental arguments</a> against belching more carbon into the stratosphere. There are local people who would be glad of the work involved in expanding an airport. There are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/we-feel-betrayed-harmondsworth-residents-furious-at-heathrow-decision\" title=\"\">residents</a> whose ears are assaulted enough already by screaming jets overhead. It is because those views are all represented in Westminster \u2013 by business lobbies, trade unions and MPs \u2013 that there is policy gridlock.</p> <p>One side will prevail and, although the defeated camp will denounce the outcome as a travesty, none could reasonably say it was perpetrated with undue haste. Heathrow\u2019s third runway, if built, will be the most democratically scrutinised strip of tarmac in the world. It will be a monument to the difficulty of balancing competing interests in an open society, for which no cheers will be raised.</p> <p>It should also stand as a rebuttal to the view of government as an elite conspiracy. Of course, it will be said that the business-lounge polluters got their way, but it is a weak plot that takes three generations to succeed and works its subterfuge by feeding submissions to endless rounds of public consultation. If the decision hinged on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2013/dec/18/illuminati-secret-society-conspiracy-jay-z\" title=\"\">global Illuminati</a> nobbling unprincipled politicians, Boris Johnson would have succumbed years ago.

Government rarely affords the luxury of easy choices. More often the arguments are balanced and public opinion is no guide. Even in the subset of views confined to the environs of Heathrow there is conflict between job creation and clean air.

It is rock, paper, scissors \u2013 each beats one of the others but none is supreme.</p> <p>This is why election winners can only ever claim conditional mandates. They cross the finish line as the least worst option. It is why referendums that scrunch complex choices into binary propositions generate as much conflict as they resolve. A narrow majority vote to leave the EU does not become the indivisible \u201cwill of the people\u201d because there is no such thing. There are fluid wills of many people. As the tortuous Heathrow process demonstrates, representative democracy is messy. Sometimes governments have to upset people in the hope that the benefits of a decision will appear over time. MPs might be pulled in different directions by constituents, party members and conscience. There is no formula for balancing that equation.</p> <p>Yet there seems to be a growing impatience with this complexity, coupled with a tendency to imagine that a decision we don\u2019t like must contain an elemental injustice; that if our own opinion is overruled, somewhere down the line democracy has been subverted. This grievance expresses itself in contempt for the whole system, shading into paranoia \u2013 the idea that corrupt elites run everything for their own gain; that \u201cthey\u201d have rigged the rules against \u201cus\u201d. There is no template of them-and-us that can usefully describe the political dynamics in a pluralist system. It is a fiction and it nurtures an appetite that is inimical to democracy \u2013 a craving for politics without dissent, common to the nationalist right and the Marxist left, where the interests of \u201cthe people\u201d are neatly aligned and channelled through infallible leaders.</p> <p>Democracy is a process, not an event. It doesn\u2019t guarantee everyone protection against the construction of a&#xa0;runway they don\u2019t want. It offers them&#xa0;the right to object and \u2013 in the absence of Soviet-style demands to pretend otherwise \u2013 the freedom, when it is built, to say in public that the process took years and still could not satisfy everyone.</p>",

  "<p>The official recognition of Impress as a regulator moves us one step closer to yet another confrontation between press and parliament.</p> <p>By itself, the decision by the Press Recognition Panel (PRP) doesn\u2019t mean much. But should this government, or any government in the future, decide to implement section 40 of the crime and courts act, it will become hugely significant.</p> <p>Even so, in advance of that law kicking in, newspaper publishers are anything but delighted by the recognition of Impress under the terms of the royal charter.</p> <p>They have created their own regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), which they are determined will not seek recognition because they view the charter as an instrument of the state and therefore inimical to press freedom.<br></p> <p>Now, with Ipso and Impress, we have two press regulators that, on the face of it, look hopelessly unequal. Ipso regulates a massive slice of the newspaper and magazine industry, including the majority of national titles, the overwhelming number of regional and local titles and the bulk of the magazine publishers.</p> <p>Impress, by contrast, is regulating 26 small online news websites, with a further 24 awaiting compliance checks. David is pitched against Goliath? </p> <p>What Goliath fears, however, is David\u2019s sling: charter recognition is a threatening weapon that has the potential to hurt all publishers who are outside Impress, whether or not they have joined Ipso (such as the Guardian, Financial Times and Private Eye).</p> <p>Impress\u2019s very existence means that should the government bring about the introduction of the section 40 provision at any stage, then non-Impress publications face the possibility of paying the legal costs of people who sue them for libel or breaches of privacy, even if they win the case.</p> <p>Impress members, by contrast, will enjoy protection from costs if people use its low-cost arbitration arm.</p> <p>At present, <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/government-backs-down-over-threat-to-press-freedom-bw2r3ckr5\">if government leaks are to be believed</a>, section 40 has been shelved for the time being. But the threat remains, as culture secretary Karen Bradley, suggested on Monday in addressing members of the Commons culture, media and sport committee.</p> <p>She said: \u201cI have made no decision on the timing of a decision on section 40. I don\u2019t rule it out at some point in the future\u201d.</p> <p>So it appears as if the founder of Impress, chief executive Jonathan Heawood, and its funder, Max Mosley, will have to wait to achieve the full effect of their initiative.</p> <p>Nevertheless, recognition represents a big step along the path to the kind of press regulation favoured by Lord Justice Leveson in the report that followed his eponymous inquiry.</p> <p>Clearly, the upper house agrees with Sir Brian. The House of Lords voted for an amendment to the investigatory powers bill, which was aimed at forcing the government to introduce section 40.</p> <p>That gave heart to Impress and its supporters, notably the press victims\u2019 body, Hacked Off, while upsetting publishers and the Ipso chairman, Sir Alan Moses.</p> <p>Several papers carried hyperbolic leading articles attacking the possibility of section 40 being triggered. The Sunday Times went so far as call it \u201cstate regulation of the press\u201d. </p> <p>Like so much of the newspaper comment on the subject, at both national and local level, this was way over the top. Even though I think the use of a royal charter, set up through the privy council, was misconceived, I cannot see how it amounts to state regulation.</p> <p>Do publishers really think broadcast news is state-regulated because outlets are monitored by Ofcom? Is Sky News\u2019s output subject to state regulation? </p> <p>And while we\u2019re on the subject of News Corporation, I hope no-one imagines that prime minister Theresa May and Rupert Murdoch sorted out the section 40 business when they met recently in New York. That would be too far-fetched, would it not?</p>",

Willows thrashing in a gale over a secluded pond; the empty coast at Dymchurch, with its groynes and coastal defences; marshes at Rye subjected to a severe geometry, where even the clouds are rhomboids. What odd, contrary paintings they are.</p> <p>But geometry really worked for Nash in Winter Sea, with its fractured and folding planes, flattened under a night sky. Illuminated by an unseen moon, Winter Sea, to which Nash returned several times between 1925 and 37, is a deceptively simple painting of inescapable menace. For me, has a kind of absolute gravitas, like a hollowed-out future disappearing into the distance. It stops me dead.<br></p> <p>Not everything Nash did was equally good. He was never what you could call a great painter. Yet we keep returning to him, because his art is full of mystery and strangeness, suffering and wonder. He saw fallen elms in a field as prowling monsters, bits of white flint as bleached human encounters. He could paint a withered plant in a pot, reflections of spherical lamps in a restaurant mirror, a meeting between a tree stump and a tennis ball on a clifftop and lend them all a peculiar significance. Sometimes the strain shows, as though surrealism wasn\u2019t really what he was aiming for, even though, at the time of the <a href=\"https://www.nationalgalleries.org/collection/artists-a-z/v/artist/various/object/international-surrealist-exhibition-london-1936-gma-a35-11rpa719\">International Surrealist Exhibition in London in 1936</a> he was dubbed England\u2019s surrealist-in-chief. But something uncanny and unhomely persists.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b734732633d7e450266e2bcf9e891417c6fa2523\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b734732633d7e450266e2bcf9e891417c6fa2523/0_0_2953_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nash\u2019s We Are Making a New World, 1918\" width=\"1000\" height=\"780\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nash\u2019s We Are Making a New World, 1918</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imperial War Museum/Tate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/paul-nash\">the second Nash Tate retrospective</a> since 2003 (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2003/jul/29/artsfeatures\">the first was in Liverpool</a>), but it covers much more ground. As well as tracing the development of Nash\u2019s painting from the 1910s until his early death in 1947, it includes his previously undervalued photography, his assemblages (some made in conjunction with his sometime lover Eileen Agar), and an entire room devoted to <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/u/unit-one\">Unit One</a>, a loose affiliation of British artists, designers and architects who, in the 1930s, saw themselves as connected to a wider European modernism. In this room we also find a small, recently rediscovered and reassembled sculpture by Nash (found in pieces in a cardboard box), which was undoubtedly influenced by the surrealist work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/oct/30/art.france\">Alberto Giacometti</a>, especially the Swiss artist\u2019s 1932 <a href=\"http://www.moma.org/collection/works/80928?locale=en\">The Palace at 4am</a>. Another of Nash\u2019s lost sculptures, The Archer (only known as a photograph), also has clear echoes of Giacometti\u2019s 1932 Flower in Danger and his 1928 Man and Woman.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c738c298c70f309e537ebbe24a07a2606855759\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c738c298c70f309e537ebbe24a07a2606855759/0_0_1536_1070/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nash in surrealist mode \u2026 Equivalents for the Megaliths, 1935.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"697\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nash in surrealist mode \u2026 Equivalents for the Megaliths, 1935.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nash may have encountered Giacometti in dissident French surrealist <a href=\"http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/find/hayward-gallery-and-visual-arts/hayward-gallery-exhibitions/past/undercover-surrealism\">Georges Bataille\u2019s subversive magazine Documents</a>. Unlikely though it seems, Documents appears to have been the model for Nash\u2019s Shell Guide to Dorset (part of a series, sponsored by the petroleum company and aimed at the car-driving tourist, under the editorial control of poet John Betjeman). Nash has the Isle of Purbeck in Dorset alive with prehistoric lizards. What was really singular about him was a sense of the visionary and of things impending, as if an unseen world were about to reveal itself.</p> <p>Nash\u2019s experience during the first world war marked him physically and psychologically. A gas attack at Passchendaele in 1917 wrecked his lungs, and his experiences in the trenches left him with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/post-traumatic-stress-disorder\">post-traumatic stress disorder.</a> A sense of the immanent was already there in Nash\u2019s sensibility, but the war gave it focus. The blasted trees of his 1918 We Are Making a New World and the spectral starburst in The Ypres Salient at Night, from the same year, have a terrible, almost mystical authority.</p> <p>The exhibition labels keep reminding us of the influence of Italian metaphysical painter <a href=\"https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/artist/giorgio-de-chirico\">Giorgio de Chirico</a> on Nash\u2019s art. Nash\u2019s still lives, set at the window of a flat overlooking London\u2019s St Pancras station, show the influence, but not the spirit. But what some of the best of Nash\u2019s work shares with De Chirico, prefiguring any influence, was a profound sense of emptiness. This was already there in Nash\u2019s early watercolours of trees and gardens, and a distant vista, where a vision of the artist\u2019s mother looms in the evening sky.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ceb9922b42c83567eec48a51282d1dad9911cee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ceb9922b42c83567eec48a51282d1dad9911cee/0_0_2097_1595/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wood on the Downs, 1930, by Paul Nash.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"761\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wood on the Downs, 1930, by Paul Nash.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aberdeen Art Gallery and Museums Collections</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here, the influence is more likely <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/samuel-palmer-411\">Samuel Palmer</a>, and though it might be attractive to see some of his early watercolours and ink drawings as connected in some way to European symbolism, to <a href=\"http://www.odilon-redon.org\">Odilon Redon</a>, their most likely progenitors were writers of supernatural fiction, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/oct/27/featuresreviews.guardianreview32\">Algernon Blackwood</a> and MR James. But then we would have to ask what attracted Nash to those authors in the first place.<br></p> <p>Although one early painting shows two young women walking in an Edwardian shrubbery, people are largely absent from Nash\u2019s work, apart from the frightening images he painted during the first world war, with soldiers silhouetted in the light of flares and explosions in the sky, and corpses strewn in the mud of no man\u2019s land. Even here, Nash is as much concerned with blasted trees, shattered concrete, an upturned helmet floating in a flooded crater, or bits of twisted metal, as he is with the soldiers. Later, in the second world war, Nash painted a scrapyard of downed German fighters and bombers at the edge of Oxford. Totes Meer is a dead sea of metal under a cold moon. A short clip of film in the exhibition shows Nash, elegant in suit and hat, sketching among the mangled wreckage, which he also photographed. </p> <p>I suspect that Nash, like JMW Turner, just wasn\u2019t that great at painting people, but this provided an opportunity to find other ways to invoke their presence. The diving stage, with its levels and platforms, and other skeletal architectural structures that occur in Nash\u2019s art in the 1920s and 30s, are mysterious signs of human activity. Just because you can\u2019t see anyone doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no one there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57eb1b5fe3e12946c5defedf5b8734cd0b07f026\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57eb1b5fe3e12946c5defedf5b8734cd0b07f026/0_0_2953_1982/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nash\u2019s Battle of Germany, 1944.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The ever-present moon \u2026 Nash\u2019s Battle of Germany, 1944.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imperial War Museum/Tate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The moon, as it was in his earliest work, is always present. It hangs huge in a break in the clouds and smoke of his 1944 Battle of Germany \u2013 a painting that is not so much a panorama as a kind of abstracted Europe under bombardment (it is not a wholly successful painting, but that doesn\u2019t really matter). It rides over his strange, late painting in which a sunflower careens over the hills like circular-saw blade, and rises over landscapes that have a strange, day-for-night light. Full of vanishing points and visual fissures and occlusions, Nash\u2019s late, equinoctial landscapes are unsettling. It is hard to tear myself away from them. I keep expecting something to happen, someone to appear. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60b8f6ebb3eb5b3fb1d3111b32455fb6b699d2cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60b8f6ebb3eb5b3fb1d3111b32455fb6b699d2cc/0_0_3600_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nash\u2019s Solstice of the Sunflower, 1945 and Eclipse of the Sunflower at Tate Britain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"584\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nash\u2019s Solstice of the Sunflower, 1945 and Eclipse of the Sunflower at Tate Britain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

The UN plans to make cash payments from a proposed $400m (\u00a3328m) cholera response package, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/world/americas/haiti-united-nations-cholera.html?ref=world&amp;_r=0\">the New York Times reported</a>.</p> <p>Alston added that the OLA\u2019s approach \u201chas been cloaked in secrecy: there has been no satisfactory official explanation of the policy, no public attempt to justify it, and no known assessment of its consequences for future cases. This goes directly against the principles of accountability, transparency and the rule of law that the UN itself promotes globally.\u201d</p> <p>Peacekeepers who were relocated from Nepal to Haiti in 2010 in the wake of a major earthquake imported the deadly cholera bacterium with them. Studies have found that the UN troops could have been screened for the illness, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/14/haiti-cholera-epidemic-un-prevention\">and the disaster averted, for as little as $2,000</a>.</p> <p>Alston said the UN\u2019s legal position appears to be largely explained by the approach of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/operations/financing.shtml\">US, the main contributor to the UN\u2019s peacekeeping budget</a>. <br tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u201cDespite numerous requests to do so, the United States itself has never publicly stated its legal position on the responsibility of the UN for causing cholera in Haiti,\u201d he added.</p> <p>\u201cInstead, it seems to have pressed the UN to adopt the position frequently taken by lawyers in the US that responsibility should never be accepted voluntarily, since it could complicate future litigation. But this rationale is completely inapplicable to the UN, which enjoys absolute immunity from suit in national courts and whose reputation depends almost entirely on being seen to act with integrity.\u201d</p> <p>The special rapporteur said that the current stance of the UN\u2019s lawyers ensures that it would never admit its responsibility for introducing cholera. \u201cAnd avoiding legal responsibility hinders the UN from learning lessons and making sure that the fatal mistakes made in Haiti are not repeated elsewhere.\u201d</p> <p>Ban\u2019s office said in a statement earlier this year that the organisation had decided to step up its efforts to fight cholera in one of the world\u2019s poorest countries. A reference to the UN\u2019s \u201cinvolvement in the initial outbreak\u201d was greeted as a breakthrough by groups working with cholera victims.</p> <p>Ban appeared to have been bounced into making a clearer recognition of responsibility than ever before by the advent of a draft report by Alston into how the UN handled the crisis. Alston had also been one of five experts working for the UN who earlier this year wrote a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/03/cholera-haiti-un-experts-chastise-ban-ki-moon\">heavily critical letter</a> to Ban in which the secretary general\u2019s resistance to accepting any responsibility was torn apart. </p>",

It also comes as Carney has two months to decide whether or not to leave the BOE in 2018, or stay on until 2021, he will make a formal announcement by the end of the year.</p> <p>If Carney voices concerns about the deteriorating relationship with the government then this would be the worst outcome for the pound in our view, as the last thing an already Brexit-frazzled foreign exchange market needs now is discord between the UK authorities.

  "<p>A press regulator funded by Max Mosley has gained recognition as a state-backed watchdog, even though no national newspapers are among its members.</p> <p>The decision by the Press Recognition Panel to recognise Impress raises the possibility that newspapers that do not join could face legal penalties under a new law that would force them to pay costs for both sides following any complaint.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But it was unclear whether the government would trigger section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 that impose the double costs rule amid suggestions that ministers would leave that aside following heavy lobbying from the industry.</p> <p>However, Impress\u2019s ability to operate effectively remains in doubt with no major newspapers currently signed up and the costs part of the legislation on hold.</p> <p>The PRP considered a number of objections to Impress\u2019s recognition, including concerns about its independence from former F1 tycoon Mosley, who has provided \u00a33.8m towards the organisation\u2019s running costs. Mosley funds Impress via two charities, a system which the PRP decided was sufficient to ensure it remained independent.</p> <p>The PRP\u2019s six-person board agreed unanimously that Impress met each of the 23 criteria set out under the royal charter. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>During the meeting, board member Harry Cayton said the PRP had to interpret the position on funding in the absence of any specific exclusions for private individuals. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe implications from the charter are the expectation that it will be the industry that will fund a regulator. But there is nothing that excludes other possibilities,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The PRP also decided that the lack of support from newspapers did not mean Impress could not be recognised and sign up titles once it was up and running.</p> <p>It also dismissed claims made in submissions from the newspaper industry that making newspapers pay both sides\u2019 costs, and the charter itself, were incompatible with the European convention on human rights, saying they were outside its remit and a matter for the culture secretary. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Cayton added: \u201cI think it\u2019s appropriate to acknowledge there are many people in the press who are concerned, but these are matters that relate to the charter, to the entire scheme, rather than the decision we have to make.\u201d <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"366e768846a0f7194176f7acc88fffa984d5e843\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/366e768846a0f7194176f7acc88fffa984d5e843/0_69_4164_2499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Max Mosley leaves the Royal Courts of Justice after winning a privacy invasion lawsuit against the News of the World in 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Max Mosley leaves the Royal Courts of Justice after winning a privacy invasion lawsuit against the News of the World in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The framework for state-backed press regulation was set up in 2013 in the wake of the Leveson inquiry. However, the UK\u2019s newspapers have opposed any attempt to force them to sign up, arguing that it would represent government interference in a free press.</p> <p>Most major newspapers have their complaints handled by Ipso, which has said it will not seek recognition from the Press Recognition Panel. Some others, such as the Guardian and the Financial Times, have their own system of regulation.</p> <p>The chair of Impress, Walter Merrick, said the recognition was the \u201cfirst step in a new era of building trust between journalists and the public that has been lacking for some time.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about the costs rules contained in section 40, he said it was \u201cpart of the package of arrangements that were put in place and which we were aware were there as part of this package when we set up Impress.<br></p> <p>\u201cCertainly we had legitimate expectations that the whole package would be brought into being. That the charter would be there, that the PRP would be there. That sections of the Crime and Courts Act would be there.\u201d<br></p> <p>Without the section 40 legislation on costs in place, the incentives for newspapers to join Impress remain weak.</p> <p>So-called \u201ccost-shifting\u201d, which applies to newspapers that have not signed up to a regulator, has been vigorously opposed by the industry, which views it as a threat to press freedom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"708ab3cb44b16034ee2c4890ea7a05bc392488e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/708ab3cb44b16034ee2c4890ea7a05bc392488e1/100_35_1648_989/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Culture Secretary Karen Bradley appearing before the Commons culture, media and sport committee.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Culture secretary Karen Bradley appearing before the Commons culture, media and sport committee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The official line from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport is that section 40 is still being considered.

A new system of independent self-regulation was agreed by the three main political parties in 2013 following consultation with victims of press intrusion and the promises made to them at the time should be honoured.</p> <p>\u201cThe culture secretary must now urgently clarify her position on section 40 and tell us whether she will enact the legislation that would allow independent self-regulation to succeed.\u201d</p> <p>However, the Times has reported that section 40 will not be implemented and proponents of press regulation are increasingly concerned that the government has no intention of passing it into law.</p> <p>The News Media Association, which represents UK national and regional newspapers, said it was disappointed in the decision to recognise Impress, but welcomed the reports section 40 would be dropped.</p> <p>Describing Impress as \u201ca regulator funded by Max Mosley and set up in order to trigger punitive costs sanctions against Britain\u2019s press\u201d, NMA deputy chief executive Lynne Anderson said: \u201cWe welcome reports that the government has decided to pull back from implementing section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act, which would inhibit a free press and have a crippling effect on regional and local newspapers.</p> <p>\u201cOver 90% of UK newspapers and magazines \u2013 over 1,500 print and 1,100 online titles \u2013 have voluntarily signed up to a system of self-regulation under Ipso which has been found to be both effective and independent of the industry. A small number of micro-businesses and multi-author blogs have been persuaded to join Impress quite unnecessarily, given they are excluded from the definition of relevant publisher. Not a single significant national or regional newspaper or magazine has signed up to the state-sponsored system of regulation under the PRP.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>November nears and many of the pre-season forecasts remain valid. Everyone is talking about Manchester, just as predicted.

Neither side will be enormously bothered about staying in the EFL Cup, though with comparisons already being wheeled out to suggest the opening period of Mourinho\u2019s tenure is no better than that of David Moyes, it is United who appear to be on the brink of managerial meltdown.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/25/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-manager-disaster-hotel\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: My Manchester life is a disaster</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Guardiola could simply be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/21/premier-league-pep-guardiola-manchester-city-claudio-bravo\">struggling with the demands</a> of English football, in particular the number of games. He has suggested that himself, particularly the difficulty of finding time for rest and recovery when every fixture is a 90-minute scrap, and City\u2019s impeccable start was bound to level out at some point. Mourinho, on the other hand, seems to be struggling with himself. His side went behind in 30 seconds at Chelsea without touching the ball, which is already the most unMourinho-like statement imaginable before factoring in the significance of the venue or the behaviour of the home fans and manager. Watching from the sidelines as three more goals went in, Mourinho looked as he has looked for most of the season in Manchester. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/24/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-antonio-conte\">Glum, passive, powerless.</a> A speech bubble over his head might contain the words: \u201cWhy is this happening to me?\u201d</p> <p>It seems a reasonable question. Mourinho badly wanted the United job, it was one of the few available commensurate with his background and ability, and crucially he knew exactly what state the club was in because he had been in England for the last couple of years. To give one obvious example, he knew all about the Wayne Rooney situation that now appears to have blown up in his face. His alleged interest in the striker while at Chelsea was one reason why Rooney ended up with a new five-year contract at United, always likely to point towards a messy endgame unless the player could maintain the high standards of his earlier years.</p> <p>Moyes awarded that contract, Mourinho has ended up with the mess. It hardly matters whether one viewed the initial promise to keep faith with Rooney as a striker and only a striker as either an optimistic ruse to bring the best from him or a cynical ploy to allow him every chance to fail, the fact is Mourinho himself changed his mind a few weeks later and used him in midfield. And now Rooney has been to all intents and purposes out of the team, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic has begun to discover that United\u2019s supply line to designated strikers is perhaps not all it might be, the optimism surrounding what appeared a solid summer\u2019s transfer business has all but disappeared.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/23/mourinho-blames-defensive-mistake-manchester-united-chelsea-premier-league-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58pcy\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2833239\"            data-video-name=\"Mourinho blames defensive mistake as Chelsea thump Manchester United \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"PLP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580d0a3be4b0582b9a8d5f67\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/23/161023mourinho_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733826&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733826&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/23/mourinho-blames-defensive-mistake-manchester-united-chelsea-premier-league-video\">Mourinho blames defensive mistake as Chelsea thump Manchester United</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Ibrahimovic, just turned 35, makes a great totem at the front of the attack but has a similar range of movement. While his finishing ability remains undiminished he has never been the quickest and requires a fairly precise service in order to flourish. A lot like Rooney, in other words. So were Mourinho to take Steve Bruce\u2019s advice \u2013 a purely theoretical notion, you understand \u2013 and give Rooney back his job as main man up front, it would have to be at the Swede\u2019s expense. Two relatively immobile strikers waiting for the ball to be delivered to feet or forehead is just not going to work, although that appeared to be Mourinho\u2019s original plan.</p> <p>It may have had a chance of working had the support cast done their job, yet none of Mourinho\u2019s summer signings has proved as decisive as the manner in which the manager went out to buy them. If a contest were arranged to try to spot the most expensive player in the world Paul Pogba would not be mentioned in the first few dozen guesses on current form \u2013 hence Mourinho\u2019s eagerness to flag up a decent performance against a side lying halfway down the Turkish league \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jul/07/henrikh-mkhitaryan-manchester-united-signing\">Henrikh Mkhitaryan</a> is still waiting to properly commence his United career after a series of bewildering excuses. At least Eric Bailly looked the part before picking up an injury at Chelsea, but as an attacking force, which is surely what Mourinho is trying to shape them into, United have stalled.</p> <p>It could even be the case Mourinho has stalled. He took over the joint-best defence in the division based on goals conceded last season, allowed himself a smile of satisfaction after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/17/liverpool-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">shutting out Liverpool at Anfield</a>, then lost the plot spectacularly at Chelsea. The old Mourinho was about certainty, not inconsistency. His teams were drilled to within an inch of their lives, not allowed to let their attention wander to the extent of conceding within a minute. United must have thought they had signed the old Mourinho, the one many worried would be too defensive and dour for the club\u2019s traditions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/24/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-antonio-conte\">Don\u2019t be too swift to bury Jos\u00e9 Mourinho \u2013 the monster may be stirring</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It appears they have ended up with some unhappy hybrid. Not so good at organising defences, playing the transfer market or transforming teams into slick machines, but still dour. Guardiola, as it happens, is getting dourer by the day too, though a win would probably bring back the smile and easy charm. One wonders if the same can be said of the United manager. Mourinho appears to have lost some of his love for football, the enjoyment is no longer discernible. United fans will know exactly how he feels.</p>",
  "<p>No one is ever going to accuse reigning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/jan/03/adrian-lewis-v-gary-anderson-pdc-world-darts-championship-final-live\">PDC world darts champion Gary Anderson</a> of hyping up the film he\u2019s more or less the hero of. \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as I thought it would be,\u201d he says, when asked what he thinks of House of Flying Arrows, a documentary that follows his progress through the 2016 world championships. \u201cI mean, I never watch myself play darts or anything. So, you know, it was bit strange to sit there, actually watching myself for a change. To sit and listen to myself talk. My God, no \u2026 \u201d</p> <p>The voice of the man who the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/mar/25/jocky-wilson-dies\">Jocky Wilson</a> nicknamed The Flying Scotsman trails off. Then he brightens. \u201cBut I quite enjoyed it. It turned out all right.\u201d It certainly did. On the face of it, darts seems a fairly improbable subject for a feature-length documentary. This is, after all, a sport in which, as co-director Daniel Mendelle admits, \u201cPeople essentially stand in the same position repeating the same action over and over again.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5feac94fbbe8d3a794d1f9a439c90df8b1537bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5feac94fbbe8d3a794d1f9a439c90df8b1537bc/0_196_4832_2898/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018People go along to have a party\u2019 \u2026 a fan at the 2016 PDC World Championships.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018People go along to have a party\u2019 \u2026 a fan at the 2016 PDC World Championships.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Paston/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s also a sport in which extravagant showmen (such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2016/jan/03/five-things-we-love-about-the-pdc-world-darts-championship-2016-in-pictures#img-5\">world No 5 Peter Wright</a>, who has a large snake painted on the shaved sides of his head in tribute to his love of lethal tipple snakebite) are vastly outnumbered by self-effacing everymen like Anderson who, as he puts it, \u201cclass ourselves as ordinary working-class people who just play darts\u201d.</p> <p>And yet House of Flying Arrows is a fascinating film. Quite aside from the stuff you might expect to see in a documentary about darts (Eric Bristow reminiscing about the old days, footage of Bobby George in his youth, when the self-styled King of Bling looked both like a surrogate member of the Clash and, as a female friend of mine noted, \u201cas hot as the Earth\u2019s core\u201d), its 90 minutes variously deal with psychology, neurology, class and mathematics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ddbc76fb337602947f0e5280736dcdb75223ea74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddbc76fb337602947f0e5280736dcdb75223ea74/0_255_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We\u2019re no superstars\u2019 \u2026 Gary Anderson in action.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019re no superstars\u2019 \u2026 Gary Anderson in action.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In one brilliant sequence, it shifts from an interview with a former Countdown champion who now uses his skills as a darts referee, via an academic explaining the intricacies of mental arithmetic, to some frankly jaw-dropping film of former player and latterday commentator Wayne Mardle reeling off the maths behind <a href=\"http://www.darts501.com/Check.html\">different finishes</a> at incredible speed.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things we hope we\u2019re doing is changing the way people look at darts,\u201d says the film\u2019s other co-director, Guardian sports writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/danielharris\">Daniel Harris</a>. \u201cNot just in a classist way, although there is, for sure, a lot of class snobbery about darts. We\u2019re just trying to present darts in a different way, saying, \u2018What haven\u2019t people seen before? What haven\u2019t they thought about before?\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Anderson is so crippled by nerves, he vomits before games</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In addition, it has the gripping air of a documentary whose storyline quickly ran out of its makers\u2019 control. At the outset, the directors clearly expected the 2016 championships to play out as a battle between reigning champ Anderson and world No 1 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/michael-van-gerwen\">Michael van Gerwen</a>, who present an intriguing study in contrasts. The former is shy, haunted by a period during which the deaths of his father and brother caused him to start missing doubles, and so crippled by nerves that he vomits before games. The latter is an ebullient, charismatic Dutch skinhead with what Harris calls \u201can amazing face for cinema\u201d, who claims he never actually aims his darts and seldom misses an opportunity <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/dec/09/michael-van-gerwen-darts-world-championship-pdc\">to inform the world</a> of his nonpareil genius.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"696bd2e5a7fb0a3eda5ebcd9ef7ca4aee0f6a636\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/696bd2e5a7fb0a3eda5ebcd9ef7ca4aee0f6a636/1237_0_2330_2912/800.jpg\" alt=\"Michael van Gerwen darts player\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018He throws his darts like they\u2019re flaming javelins\u2019 \u2026 Michael van Gerwen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it didn\u2019t work out like that. Shortly after telling the cameras that his current form represents \u201cthe greatest darts ever seen on television\u201d (albeit not without reason: in July this year, he scored the highest average ever recorded in a televised match), Van Gerwen is knocked out in the third round. \u201cHe throws his darts like a flaming javelin,\u201d says Harris. \u201cThat average he got in July, it\u2019s hard to believe a human being can get much better at darts than that. You\u2019d probably struggle to construct a robot that could do better. But I think his opponent just handled the pressure better. One of the things that\u2019s fascinating about darts is the pressure, and how players cope with it, which is why we\u2019ve got a neuroscientist who specialises in pressure explaining what\u2019s actually going on.\u201d</p> <p>As the finals progress, you find yourself increasingly rooting for Anderson despite, or perhaps because of, his often visible discomfort at being filmed. Indeed, there\u2019s a sense that the film might reach its climax not with the final itself, but just before, when Anderson finally tires of the crew\u2019s presence: about to walk on stage, he looks directly into a camera, smiles, and quietly but firmly tells them to fuck off.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a raft of other players are introduced, almost all of them fascinating in their own way, but none more so than the drily funny, very eloquent <a href=\"http://jameswade.co.uk/\">James Wade</a>: a man diagnosed with ADHD, bipolar disorder and autism, who used to have Dizzee Rascal\u2019s Bonkers as his walk-on music. It explores their peculiar brand of fame: on the one hand, there\u2019s big money to be made as a professional, as you might expect, given that the Premier League tournament can fill out every arena in Britain, from the London O2 to the Glasgow Hydro; on the other, even the biggest stars will turn up at exhibition matches and play local players and members of the audience, the equivalent of Jamie Vardy or Cesc Fabregas arriving at a provincial Sunday league pitch for a kickabout.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOPACWnJWGU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iOPACWnJWGU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOPACWnJWGU\">House of Flying Arrows Trailer</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Then there\u2019s the curious relationship between darts fans and their sport. It starts, says Harris, from an unusual premise: \u201cIf you go to watch darts, you can\u2019t actually see the action. You can\u2019t really see the dartboard unless you watch it on the screens, so people go along to have a party. People dress up in fancy dress. One guy we met while filming at the championships started explaining that by talking about Guy Debord and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/14/guy-debord-society-spectacle-will-self\">The Society of the Spectacle</a>.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2016/jan/03/five-things-we-love-about-the-pdc-world-darts-championship-2016-in-pictures\">Five things we love about the PDC World Darts Championship 2016 \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Harris frowns at the mention of the French Marxist theorist and his influential work. \u201cI think we disagreed about that a little. I think it\u2019s more like a fancy dress party. They behave differently to the way they normally would because they\u2019re drinking and they\u2019re in fancy dress. But it\u2019s all in a really non-threatening way: it\u2019s not partisan, there\u2019s none of the needle you get in football. People might have their favourites, but everyone cheers everyone. I don\u2019t want to sound soppy, but it\u2019s quite a beautiful thing to see.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There's no luck, no tactics, no team-mates to save you</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Harris always thought a big-screen documentary about darts would work. \u201cObviously, it doesn\u2019t have the aesthetic beauty of boxing or tennis or football or cricket, but it\u2019s just got a special kind of drama. No other sport shows simultaneous action and reaction. No other sport deals in such close-up images. That gives the human story a unique intensity. One of the things about sport is that you\u2019re basically voyeuristically watching someone live out the most exhilarating, demoralising moments of their life \u2013 and nothing gives you that with the same level of intensity as darts. There\u2019s no luck or tactics involved, there\u2019s nothing players can do to affect one another, and if you\u2019re in trouble, no team-mate can save you. You can\u2019t roll, cover up, or block a few. It\u2019s a simple game, but there\u2019s an incredible amount going on.\u201d</p> <p>Although Gary Anderson didn\u2019t always enjoy being filmed away from the oche (\u201cThere\u2019s days when you get home and you just want a bit of peace and you\u2019ve got a wally with a camera there\u201d), he does agree that the film has captured something of the game: \u201cIt shows people what we\u2019re like. I mean, I keep saying, we\u2019re no superstars, we\u2019re just darts players. But,\u201d he adds, \u201cI thought it was quite good.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 House of Flying Arrows is available on digital download from 31 October and on Blu-ray and DVD from 14 November.</p>",
  "<ul> <li><em>Warning: this article contains some spoilers.</em><br></li> </ul> <h2>Hated in the Nation</h2> <p>Hated in the Nation is Black Mirror\u2019s excursion into public shame: it takes a series of targets who have brought disapprobation upon themselves. One is a columnist who slates a disabled person; another, an X Factor style judge who scorns a nine-year-old; a protestor who pretends to urinate on a war memorial; a politician so closely modelled on George Osborne that it made me feel nostalgic for a pre-Brexit age, when he was the summit of Tory obnoxiousness. They all find themselves in the eye of a Twitter storm, only this time it\u2019s for real \u2013 the anger doesn\u2019t crescendo then vanish. Instead, it culminates in violence so agonising that a person would slash her own throat with a broken bottle of Merlot to hasten it.</p> <p>There is a poignant description at one point of what it feels like to be in the eye of such a storm: \u201cIt was like having a whole weather system turn against me. If there\u2019s a million people talking about how they despise you, it\u2019s like a mental illness.\u201d It\u2019s a morality tale. If you want to hate, audibly, you must accept that hatred causes pain. Having done so, you yourself are as despicable as the person you despise. It\u2019s a simple and symmetrical world, one which sees the age before social media as prelapsarian, and yearns for us all to realise so we can return to a better time.</p> <p> When you\u2019re actually in a social media storm, you amplify the porousness between the virtual and the real. I\u2019ve been in two, once when I failed to properly respect breast milk as liquid gold, another time when I defended protesters who spat at a Conservative party conference (what I actually said was \u2026 oh never mind). In both cases, people online were printing public appearances I was planning to make, and telling others to throw eggs at me; someone published the name of my children\u2019s school and told people to go spit at them. It was the wrong school, but the point stood: my children had come into play. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f9e8c1bc96bb71f6114d740f12ebc5b0828aba1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f9e8c1bc96bb71f6114d740f12ebc5b0828aba1/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018If there\u2019s a million people talking about how they despise you, it\u2019s like a mental illness\u2019 \u2026 Hated in the Nation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If there\u2019s a million people talking about how they despise you, it\u2019s like a mental illness\u2019 \u2026 Hated in the Nation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurie Sparham/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whenever I described these events, I always underlined the threats at their most extreme, even though I knew this confected rage would never result in anything. I exaggerated the sabre-rattling, to bring to life how unpleasant the experience was. So we were all colluding \u2013 they were pretending their violence and I was pretending to believe in it \u2013 because without the backstop of action, they were just hysterics in their underpants and I was oversensitive. </p> <p>This is the fascinating space of modern shame: precisely, that it has no consequence, that the intensity of its spleen is a function of its meaninglessness, that the overstatement is partly driven by a suffocating sense of inauthenticity. It is to a baying mob what clicktivism is to activism; you can\u2019t persuade anyone you\u2019re serious unless you actually turn up. Hated in the Nation went to the least interesting place, where sofa hate transmutes by a <em>deus ex technica</em> into reality.

But in 2016, it feels more like an examination of contemporary discourse on refugees and migrants, and of how governments and the media alike use propaganda to turn the public against foreigners.</p> <p>Men Against Fire centres on a squad of American troops tasked with exterminating several hundred outlaws hiding in what seems to be the Dutch countryside. To dehumanise their prey, the soldiers uniformly refer to them as \u201croaches\u201d, and describe individual roaches as \u201cit\u201d, rather than her or him. And to ensure they never develop any fleeting sympathy for the enemy, the soldiers are fitted with special brain implants. On first impression, the setup seems far-fetched.

You also hear similar arguments from western politicians about rescue missions in the Mediterranean: if you start saving people, Home Office ministers have argued, you\u2019ll only attract more of them. Even the word \u201croach\u201d mimics the vocabulary used by Katie Hopkins in the Sun.</p> <p>To some, the idea of hunting migrants might seem too unlikely a metaphor. But we already have vigilantes hunting people on the Bulgarian border. During the Hungarian referendum, one campaigner suggested shooting migrants arriving from Serbia. And once people realise that fences and walls don\u2019t stop migration, I am sure there will be more mainstream calls for even more violent responses.</p> <p>Brain implants certainly sound beyond the realms of current possibility. Then again, perhaps our empathy has already been subliminally suppressed by other means. <a href=\"http://budapestbeacon.com/featured-articles/we-must-stop-brussels-referendum-booklet-warns-hungarians/38777\">In Hungary, the government\u2019s recent anti-refugee ad campaign was the largest in the country\u2019s history</a>.

How many people would really, given the chance, play an interactive horror experience delivered via a cybernetic implant that has to be shot into your neck \u2013 an implant that will hack your brain, discover your deepest fears and project them in front of you as part of an immersive augmented reality nightmare? That seems like a very niche audience. But then, five years ago, who would have thought 500 million people would download <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pokemon-go\">a game</a> that involved chasing imaginary creatures down a high street before trapping them in an imaginary ball? Charlie Brooker has always taken our consumer technology obsessions to the very edges of twisted fantasy \u2013 and we usually catch up in the end. </p> <p>In Playtest, then, American dudebro Cooper Redfield sets off to travel the world, a non-stop selfie tour through India, Thailand and Italy, before he crashes down in London, bored and alone. Straight after hooking up with tech journalist Sonja (Hannah John-Kamen) on a Tinder-like dating app, he finds his credit cards have been cancelled (coincidence? Hmm) and needs to make money fast \u2013 when she spots a job ad asking for volunteers to test a new video game. The next thing we know he\u2019s being whisked to the development studio in a beautiful manor house. It turns out this is the home of visionary game developer Shou Saito (clearly modelled on Metal Gear creator <a href=\"http://www.universityherald.com/articles/41750/20160926/hideo-kojima-slams-metal-gear-survive-zombies-game-development-gameplay-demo-vid-gets-22-856-dislikes-fans-agree.htm\">Hideo Kojima</a>), who is famed for his dark horror adventures. He\u2019s got a new project on the go \u2013 the aforementioned AR nightmare-fest. Desperate for cash, and clearly not too bright, Cooper agrees to be a guinea pig, and Saito\u2019s assistant Katie injects the AR device into his spine. She explains that he\u2019ll begin to see things that aren\u2019t really there \u2013 computer generated figures and objects that look real, but can\u2019t touch or hurt him. Sure, whatever.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/19/charlie-brooker-someone-threatened-to-smuggle-a-rifle-through-customs-and-kill-me\">Charlie Brooker: 'Someone threatened to smuggle a rifle through customs and kill me'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For extra fun, he\u2019s taken to a nearby hunting lodge. Naturally, he begins to experience subtle moments of dread: a painting of the mansion on the wall suddenly has a light showing in an upstairs window, then a figure. A spider runs across the floor, and Cooper recoils. The system is probing his fears. From this point, things get more disturbing: as the AI mines his mind\u2019s darkest recesses, we discover that Cooper\u2019s dad recently died from early onset Alzheimer\u2019s and his father\u2019s gradual loss of cognitive functions is what really terrifies our hero. </p> <p>It is, at times, genuinely creepy, especially as Cooper\u2019s laddish confidence disintegrates as his computer-rendered terrors slowly crush his resolve. It\u2019s also a rich tapestry of video game in-jokes. Resident Evil is ever-present: Cooper\u2019s surname is Redfield, a reference to the siblings Chris and Claire Redfield from the series. Plus, the fact that the whole thing is a human experiment in a hunting lodge recalls the mansion laboratory setting of the original Resident Evil. The Silent Hill games are here too, in the emphasis on hallucination and psychological collapse, and when Katie yells \u201c<em>would you kindly</em> open that door\u201d to Cooper, she\u2019s alluding to the dark adventure Bioshock. It\u2019s a compelling meta-narrative on gaming conventions and experiences.</p> <p>But the target is unfocused. Is it AR technology that we are to fear? The pseudo-visionaries that peddle invasive technologies as brave new worlds? Or the way social media encourages a narcissistic fixation with our own personalities? Maybe it\u2019s all of these. But as a cautionary tale, Playtest mostly operates like the torture porn series Hostel: dumb young dudes do stupid stuff for fun and money, which they should have thought through more carefully first.</p> <p><em>Keith Stuart, the Guardian\u2019s Games Editor</em></p> <h2>Nosedive</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b33a24a8b3a79471319c8779d2e05117bcad451\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b33a24a8b3a79471319c8779d2e05117bcad451/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bubble of bullshit that so closely resembles our own world \u2026 Nosedive.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bubble of bullshit that so closely resembles our own world \u2026 Nosedive.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Dettmann/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of all the episodes of this digital dystopia, Nosedive is the most analogous with our own world (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/19/charlie-brooker-someone-threatened-to-smuggle-a-rifle-through-customs-and-kill-me\">David Cameron and pigs aside</a>).

But the real-world impact of one\u2019s star rating most closely resembles Uber, for which drivers can have their work terminated if their rating drops below 4.6.

They were different songs which happened to share a title, but the sentiment was the same. And although set in 1987, Charlie Brooker uses the episode San Junipero to riff on the same idea: that love can transcend everything.</p> <p>As the episode opens we meet Yorkie (Mackenzie Davis), a geek with glasses and more than a passing resemblance to Molly Ringwald. Getting to know the downtown scene of San Junipero for the first time, she heads to the local nightclub for a retro night out immediately signposted by the DJs playlist: Belinda Carlisle, the Bangles and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGtf9QfITQw\">Robbie Nevil</a>.</p> <p>In the pink and blue light of the club she meets Kelly (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), who sits next to her to dodge an eager ex-boyfriend. Soon the two are pulling Janet Jackson moves on the dancefloor and Kelly is making a pass at Yorkie, which she deflects. The next time they see each other, Kelly\u2019s dressed as Madonna in Desperately Seeking Susan and the two hook up. Then Kelly disappears. </p> <p>The closer you look at this rendering of 1987, something seems a bit off. Everything points to the spectre of another reality rippling through the neon. There are cigarettes which can\u2019t be tasted, mirrors that don\u2019t crack when they\u2019re punched. The pop culture that surrounds Yorkie\u2019s 1987 speaks to other worlds and split personalities: the Lost Boys, Max Headroom, Fake by Alexander O\u2019Neal. And of course the multi-textual 80s we loved in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/05/netflix-hit-stranger-things-highlights-tvs-trend-for-nostalgia\">Stranger Things</a> is also present (I counted references to Pretty in Pink, Weird Science and The Terminator but I\u2019m sure there are more). As Yorkie pursues Kelly through different years (1987, 1997, 2002) we realise that time is as illusive as her paramour. \u201cTry a different time,\u201d Yorkie is advised by one of Kelly\u2019s ex\u2019s. \u201cShe\u2019s worth it.\u201d</p> <p>This is a sci-rom where everyone is anaesthetised against feeling anything, except, incidentally, love. But it isn\u2019t the Time Traveller\u2019s Wife: what Brooker presents is time travel as a tonic for assisted living. In the present day, Yorkie is hooked up to a life support machine and Kelly is a woman in her autumn years. Life after death exists as a void without a god. San Junipero is instead the hedonistic haven, a virtual reality where the dying hook into a Matrix-like motherboard of their Greatest Hits past. Brooker says a lot of things here, about atheism, tolerance, euthanasia and the spirit, but it\u2019s his ability to capture the purity of new love that stays with you.</p> <p><em>Priya Elan</em></p> <h2>Shut Up and Dance</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bb6a324629d49214960249d07805019db472c5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bb6a324629d49214960249d07805019db472c5d/0_32_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Terrifyingly plausible \u2026 Shut Up and Dance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terrifyingly plausible \u2026 Shut Up and Dance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurie Sparham/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have some bad news about Shut Up and Dance: it\u2019s not really science fiction.

Turing was convicted of gross indecency in 1952 and chemically castrated. He died two years later and an inquest found he had killed himself.</p> <p>Private homosexual acts between men aged over 21 were decriminalised in England and Wales in 1967, but the law in Scotland was not changed until 1980.</p> <p>Addressing the Holyrood chamber on Tuesday, Matheson said: \u201cIt is sadly the case that Scotland has only relatively recently modernised our criminal laws so that they no longer discriminate against same-sex sexual activity. It is shocking to consider that consensual sex between men was only decriminalised in Scotland in 1980 and the age of consent for same-sex sexual activity was not equalised for sexual activity between men and women until 2001.</p> <p>\u201cSuch laws clearly have no place in a modern and inclusive Scotland. However, there are people with criminal convictions for same-sex sexual activity that is now lawful and we must right this wrong.\u201d</p> <p>The Scottish Labour leader, Kezia Dugdale, who raised the question of pardons with the Scottish government, described it as \u201ca historic moment\u201d. </p> <p>Dugdale, herself one of three openly gay party leaders in Holyrood, said: \u201cSince devolution we have seen section 2A abolished, civil partnerships legislated for and then same sex marriages introduced.<br tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u201cIt\u2019s easy enough to pat ourselves on the back, but what is just as important as getting things right for the future is accepting we got things wrong in the past. Then crucially righting those wrongs. This public acknowledgment that our laws were wrong is a historic moment for equality, acceptance and respect in our country.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cFor many men, an apology is as important as a formal pardon \u2013 because an apology demonstrates that they should never have been branded criminal in the first place. I am therefore also pleased the Scottish government is seriously considering apologies alongside legislative pardons.\u201d</p> <p>Welcoming the announcement as an \u201cimportant step\u201d, Nicolson said: \u201cWe have made huge progress towards achieving LGBTI equality in recent years, with improvements in laws and attitudes that have seen Scotland now become the best country in Europe for LGBTI legal rights.</p> <p>\u201cDespite this welcome and hard-won progress we must never forget the appalling way that LGBTI people have been treated in the UK in our recent past.<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u201cThe criminalisation of gay and bisexual men, who were cautioned and convicted under homophobic laws that banned sex between consenting adult men is a blemish on our history and it is right that we now address this injustice with a full and automatic pardon, and a system that allows people to have these discriminatory convictions removed from their records.\u201d<br><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

Idomeni and Calais \u2013 at the southern and northern edges of continental Europe \u2013 were by far the largest such camps, each home to 9,000 or more. But there are others: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/serbia-refugees-hungarian-border-macedonia-bulgaria\" title=\"\">in Serbia, for instance, on the border with Hungary</a> \u2013 one of the first frontiers in Europe to be fenced with razor wire.</p> <p>These places are grim, chaotic and threatening, especially for women and children, who often travel alone. In Idomeni, before it was cleared, I sat with a Syrian man who had that morning tried to hang himself, unable to bear watching his family suffer another day. I heard tales of nightly knife fights on the edges of the camp; of traffickers abducting children into slavery. When it rained, rivers of mud poured through the flimsy tents. But I also understand why some people prefer to stay in such camps than go to official centres, where conditions may be no better and the prospects for escape much worse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9de96727af7791673c7c2557972487f92e8735b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9de96727af7791673c7c2557972487f92e8735b0/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"food queue at the Idomeni camp, in Greece\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A food queue at the Idomeni camp, in Greece.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marko Djurica/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAs long as we\u2019re here, by the border, there\u2019s hope,\u201d a young man in Idomeni said to me before it was razed. \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving here until the border opens.\u201d</p> <p>He did leave, of course; there\u2019s nothing there now but green fields ruffled by wind. What\u2019s gone \u2013 destroyed almost without trace in just a few days \u2013 was, like Calais, becoming a small town, with shops and falafel stands and internet cafes, barber shops,&#xa0;language classes and even a TV station, sending stories from Idomeni out to the wider world. And as in Calais, hundreds of international volunteers \u2013 some from&#xa0;mainstream NGOs, but many self-organised \u2013 made life more bearable, providing everything from food and information to childcare, friendship and concern.</p> <p>The main reason for wanting to stay near the border, or the Channel, is obviously to cross it: the opportunities, and the traffickers, are there. But, without wanting to romanticise it, Idomeni, like Calais, was for some of its residents also a kind of home: a place where they had a little agency in their daily lives, and where despair was tempered by a sliver of hope that the border would open, or that they could somehow slip through and move on.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The message to Europeans is: 'Look, we\u2019re taking control.' The message to refugees is: 'Don\u2019t come.'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s that hope, above all, that the razing of of such camps shuts down. The existence of these squalid shanty towns is a symptom of Europe\u2019s failure to manage the refugee reception crisis, as well as migration more broadly; closing them does nothing for the underlying problem. In France, as in Greece, the process is driven by politics \u2013 the wish to clean the place up, disperse the people, make them less visible \u2013 rather than any plan for meeting the needs of refugees, or managing mass migration from the global south. The message to Europeans is: \u201cLook, we\u2019re taking control.\u201d The message to refugees is: \u201cDon\u2019t come.\u201d</p> <p>Dispersing people may reduce local resentment, but it also undermines empathy. Since Idomeni was cleared there\u2019s been far less media focus on the plight of the 60,000 people still stuck in Greece. But most of those evicted from the camp are still sheltering in derelict factories and warehouses, or tents pitched on hard gravel where snakes slither in and rainwater floods through.</p> <p>One family I know spent several weeks in hospital because their two small daughters developed blood poisoning from insect bites. Some prefer to sleep on the streets rather than live in Greece\u2019s derelict industrial infrastructure, out of sight and out of mind, cut off from volunteers and local populations.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/feb/29/calais-shelters-on-fire-refugees-police-clash-jungle-break-up-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4h6jj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2465281\"            data-video-name=\"Calais shelters set on fire as refugees clash with police over 'Jungle' break up \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56d477b6e4b0e3887170f3b2\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/02/29/160229CalaisFire_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/02/29/160229CalaisFire.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/02/29/160229CalaisFire_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/02/29/160229CalaisFire_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11281581&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/feb/29/calais-shelters-on-fire-refugees-police-clash-jungle-break-up-video\">Calais shelters set on fire as refugees clash with police - video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>And though the closure of the camp was meant to undercut the people smugglers, they are, if anything, doing an even more thriving trade.

But if the experience of Idomeni is anything to go by, many will slip away from Calais rather than subject themselves to an uncertain asylum process, which is unlikely to send them where they want to go, and may well return them to danger or extreme poverty. Some will find their feet, legally or illegally, in French cities and towns. Some, including children, will fall victim to traffickers. And, unless Europe works to open safe routes for refugees, unofficial camps will continue to spring up across the continent, with all the risks and dangers of Idomeni or Calais.</p>",

  "<p>Sitting with Marta Po\u015blad, 30, in a busy cafe at the hip Saviour Square in central Warsaw, you get the feeling that she knows everyone. Whoever passes \u2013 a politician, a businessman or an artist \u2013 she greets them cheerfully. Between these conversations, her mobile phones buzz ceaselessly on the table.</p> <p>As Google\u2019s head of public policy for central and eastern Europe, it is part of her job to know everyone. Back in 2006, Po\u015blad was among the first students to leave for Britain\u2019s top universities following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/eu/country/0,14489,1193436,00.html\">Poland\u2019s accession to the European Union</a>. She has no doubts that studying for an MPhil degree at Cambridge has been formative to her career. \u201cIt has broadened my intellectual horizons, given me confidence and guaranteed recognition in the eyes of employers back home,\u201d she says. However, she never really hesitated about returning to Poland.</p> <p>\u201cI have always known that public policy is what I wanted to do,\u201d she says, \u201cbut if there is one thing any career in this field is linked to, it is your passport.\u201d In London, she was just one of many Oxbridge graduates \u2013 and a foreign one. In Poland, she was one of the few. The leverage was substantial.</p> <p>\u201cI remember all the talk about catching up with Europe, often expressed in civilisational terms. My generation realised, however, that this delay created many opportunities to innovate, go through uncharted territory, and take an active part in forming this new Poland,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The country has indeed become increasingly attractive for people like her. Spared the troubles of the <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/schoolsbrief/21584534-effects-financial-crisis-are-still-being-felt-five-years-article\">2008 financial crisis</a>, it no longer relies just on sentiment when luring the best talent and investors to move there, but on its solid economic performance and <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2015/02/11/how-poland-became-europes-growth-champion-insights-from-the-successful-post-socialist-transition/\">robust growth rate</a>. In fact, Po\u015blad claims her career prospects and standard of living are simply better in Warsaw than in London. Last year, she divided her time between offices in both cities \u2013 and she chose to settle in Poland. \u201cA studio in the very centre of Warsaw wins over a flatshare in east London \u2013 one of many things in favour of Poland,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59aac3c0a8ffdcd52d197b926d5a7a30fed031c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59aac3c0a8ffdcd52d197b926d5a7a30fed031c3/1079_526_3251_1951/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018My place is back here\u2019 ...

While the vast majority of Poles living in the UK have little or no intention of returning, research shows a reverse trend when it comes to more than 5,200 <a href=\"http://polsoc.org.uk\">Polish students at Britain\u2019s top universities</a>. According to a poll by Boston Consulting Group, as many as 83% want to return to Poland in the foreseeable future: 51% of them hope to get more than four years of work experience first, but 32% expect to move in the first three years after graduation. They also point to the higher standard of living as a primary factor (36%).</p> <p>\u201cIt has become a new norm that people of my generation have some experience of studying or working abroad,\u201d says astronomer Jakub Bochi\u0144ski. Aged 27, he heads the <a href=\"http://www.kopernik.org.pl/en/news/n/esa-brings-space-to-the-classroom-in-poland/\">European Space Agency\u2019s education office in Warsaw</a>, where he manages programmes aiming to make Polish teenagers more interested in exploring space. Last year, teams of 13- to 18-year-olds designed scientific satellites sent on a rocket into the atmosphere. This year, as part of the British-led <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/education/programmes/astro-pi/\">Astro Pi project</a> launched by astronaut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2016/jun/21/tim-peake-i-would-return-to-space-in-a-heartbeat-video\">Tim Peake</a>, they are coding apps for the international space station to run in space.</p> <p>\u201cI have learned, during my studies in Britain, that the more freedom you get to come up with an idea, the better \u2013 and it works with teenagers just as well,\u201d Bochi\u0144ski says. He studied mathematics and astrophysics at University College London and later completed a PhD at the Open University in Milton Keynes. \u201cThis is one of the things that make Britain great \u2013 this fantastic, collaborative education system, a real product for the whole world to benefit and learn from,\u201d he says. However, after eight years in Britain, he moved back to Poland last year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bb1b55a79eb2d1d60250c8e71d99c02a7e89e5f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb1b55a79eb2d1d60250c8e71d99c02a7e89e5f4/854_0_3368_4000/842.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It would not feel genuine to present myself as a Brit\u2019 ...

As a science communicator, he competed in the British Council\u2019s FameLab project at Warsaw\u2019s state-of-the-art <a href=\"http://www.kopernik.org.pl/en/\">Copernicus science centre</a>. Standing on the bank of the Vistula river, the centre, one of the most technologically advanced in Europe, has become a symbol of rapid change in Poland. Bochi\u0144ski was impressed by how the country had transformed \u2013 and decided it was time to return.</p> <p>He did not come back alone, however. During his studies, Bochi\u0144ski met a fellow Polish student in Britain \u2013 Gosia, from the University of St Andrews. \u201cWe met at a scientific conference in Oxford, <a href=\"http://www.polishperspectives.org\">Science: Polish Perspectives</a>. A year later we organised it together. Three years later, we were married. Once again, Britain is responsible for an important change in my life.\u201d</p> <p>Career prospects played an important part in their decision. \u201cTo a scientist, Poland feels like it must have felt for capitalist entrepreneurs back in the 1990s, during the first years of wild economic transition. Whole areas of science are booming and up for grabs as we rapidly catch up with the world. It is like taking part in a revolution.\u201d</p> <p>Despite living in Britain for many years, he never thought about applying for citizenship. \u201cIt would not feel genuine to present myself as a Brit. I always felt Polish, and thought about Poland as my final destination,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He believes that Poland may even end up as a major regional hub, finally using its long-cursed geopolitical position between the west and the east. \u201cEven more so after Brexit. I feel bad saying that, with my genuine sentiment for Britain, but your loss will be our gain: one rival less for major scientific contracts.\u201d</p> <p>Tomasz Szatkowski, another graduate of a British university who returned to a top job in Poland, is more diplomatic. Aged 38, he is <a href=\"http://en.mon.gov.pl/ministry/leaders/under-secretary-of-state-tomasz-szatkowski/\">Poland\u2019s deputy defence minister</a> and was in charge of preparing this year\u2019s Nato summit in Warsaw. He chooses his words carefully as we sit in his office in the ministry\u2019s secure zone. \u201cWe respect the sovereign decision of the British people, and will continue to work closely with the British government,\u201d he states officially. However, behind this official line, some real sympathy for Britain is evident.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"149f177ce7a4b71647054b21a54fe96146df0294\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/149f177ce7a4b71647054b21a54fe96146df0294/555_210_3907_2345/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Some of the things I learned at King\u2019s were reflected in our policy\u2019 ... deputy defence minister Tomasz Szatkowski.

In 1998, he came for a language course, and in 2000, still as a student at the University of Warsaw\u2019s department of law, he briefly worked in London to earn some pocket money. \u201cI remember visiting the <a href=\"http://www.posk.org/c5/en/home/\">Polish Social and Cultural Centre</a> in Hammersmith back then, where many second world war veterans would meet for lunch. It was genuinely touching, a reminder of the important part of Poland\u2019s history connected with London, as our government-in-exile operated here for 50 years,\u201d he recalls.</p> <p>In 2003, while working as a parliament staffer with the newly established conservative Law and Justice party, Szatkowski decided to continue his studies in Britain. He completed an application for a Foreign Office-sponsored Chevening scholarship, collected a dozen references, and hoped for the best. The following year, he joined King\u2019s College London\u2019s war studies programme \u2013 his first essay was on the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-28167071\">Polish contribution</a> to cracking the Nazi Enigma machine. One of the lectures was held in the Polish room of the highly secretive Special Forces Club in Knightsbridge, with a national emblem on the walls remembering the dedication of many Polish intelligence officers working along with the British.</p> <p>Shortly after Szatkowski\u2019s graduation in 2005, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/25/poland-lurches-to-right-with-election-of-law-and-justice-party\">Law and Justice party</a> won the parliamentary elections, opening the way for him to serve in the government as a junior aide to one of the ministers. \u201cIn fact, some of the things I learned during my time at King\u2019s were later reflected in our policy. You can call it a Chevening legacy, if you want.\u201d</p> <p>He thought about continuing his studies in Britain and applying for a PhD at Oxford, but decided to return to Warsaw to be with his newly started family. In April this year, he visited London in his new official capacity as a deputy defence minister. \u201cLondon certainly played an important part in this journey,\u201d he says. He is wearing a tie with an emblem of his alma mater, King\u2019s College London. \u201cMaybe it is a bit old-fashioned now, but I have kept it over the years \u2013 it is a nice souvenir.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Jakub Krupa is the UK correspondent for the Polish Press Agency and a graduate of the LSE. @JakubKrupa</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ec6f8dedea7818d7f2ef890dbc480c54bb63223\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ec6f8dedea7818d7f2ef890dbc480c54bb63223/0_120_3309_1985/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young Poles get tickets for public transport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Young Poles get tickets for public transport on world car-free day in Warsaw, 22 September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gallo Images/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Poland in statistics \u2013 from GDP to the cost of a litre of milk<br><br></h2> <p>Long a poster-child of successful post-communist transition, Poland regularly scores high marks from international economic institutions for its reform efforts, and headline figures tend to compare favourably with other countries still emerging from communist rule.</p> <p>But it remains significantly poorer than the UK in terms of 2013 GDP per capita, with Poland on $13,647, compared with UK GDP per capita of $41,787.47. <em>(Source: World Bank)</em></p> <p><strong>Average household net-adjusted disposable income per capita<br></strong>$17,820, less than the OECD average of $29,016 a year. <em>(Source: OECD)</em></p> <p><strong>Unemployment rate<br></strong>7.5% of the labour force, compared with 5.3% in the UK.

  "<p>Canadian police charged a 49-year-old former nurse on Tuesday with eight counts of first-degree murder over the deaths of elderly residents at long-term care facilities in south-western Ontario.</p> <p>Elizabeth Tracey Mae Wettlaufer is accused of administering a drug to at least seven of the eight victims, who ranged in age from 75 to 96, between August 2007 and August 2014, according to Ontario provincial police (OPP) and two municipal Ontario police forces involved in the multi-jurisdictional homicide investigation.</p> <p>Seven of the alleged murders occurred at a nursing home in Woodstock, Ontario, where Wettlaufer reportedly worked as a registered nurse for two and a half years from 2007, Caressant Care Nursing and Retirement Homes Ltd, which runs the facility.</p> <p>The other death happened at Meadow Park, a long-term care home in London, Ontario, where Wettlaufer was also an employee.</p> <p>Police in Woodstock began the investigation on 29 September after receiving information that \u201ceight people had been murdered over a period of several years\u201d, according to an OPP news release. Given the nature of the allegations, the OPP was brought in to manage the investigation, which involved members of the Woodstock and London police services.</p> <p>Wettlaufer appeared in court on Tuesday morning and was remanded into custody.</p> <p>A Caressant Care spokesman, Lee Griffi, said in a statement that the company, which runs 15 nursing homes in mainly small towns in Ontario, is \u201ccooperating fully\u201d with police.</p> <p>\u201cWe deeply regret the additional grief and stress this is imposing on the families involved,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe are determined to avoid compromising the police investigation in any way and are therefore unable to provide any additional comment at this time.\u201d</p> <p>A Meadow Park spokeswoman, Julia King, said in a statement that the facility is also \u201ccooperating fully\u201d with police in their investigation of Wettlaufer, who \u201cleft our home\u2019s employ some two years ago.\u201d<br></p> <p>She too said the long-term care home would not comment further \u201cto avoid compromising the police investigation in any way\u201d.</p> <p>Wettlaufer registered as a nurse in Ontario in 1995 and resigned from the Colleges of Nurses of Ontario on 30 September 2016, one day after the police investigation began.</p> <p>If convicted on all eight counts of first-degree murder, Wettlaufer could spend the rest of her life behind bars.</p> <p>In Canada, first-degree murder carries a minimum 25-year prison sentence before a convict is eligible for parole. But under legislation enacted under the former Canadian Conservative government in late 2011, a judge could impose consecutive 25-year parole ineligibility periods.<br><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>As the ball bobbled across the face of goal, evaded his outstretched right foot and brushed off his back-side, Jozy Altidore\u2019s Premier League career hit rock bottom.</p> <p>More than a year after his previous \u2013 and only \u2013 Premier League strike for struggling Sunderland, Altidore\u2019s final start in English football was characterized by a horrifying miss from two meters out against West Ham, just as the net was irreversibly poised to ripple.</p> <p>\u201cHe was devastated, I have never seen Jozy like that,\u201d admitted Altidore\u2019s then-manager Gus Poyet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/24/breaking-the-law-soccer-playoffs\">It's time to introduce a two-legged MLS Cup - with a twist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just 18 months after he had scored upwards of 30 goals in a single season for Dutch side AZ Alkmaar, Altidore couldn\u2019t even get one, and his confidence was utterly shot as a consequence. He\u2019d even become a figure of fun among Sunderland fans, who saw humor as the only way to cope with the toiling striker.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Jozy scores, we\u2019re on the pitch,\u201d was the pledge over an impromptu pitch invasion in celebration of an Altidore goal.</p> <p>It had been a similar story during the USMNT\u2019s man previous spell in England at Hull City, where \u2013 again \u2013 there was only one league goal to show for his efforts. No matter the prolific form for his country, Altidore just couldn\u2019t make the grade in the Premier League.</p> <p>But almost two years on, Altidore will spearhead the Toronto FC attack in Wednesday\u2019s opening stage of the MLS Cup play-offs as arguably the most in-form frontman in North America after nine goals from his last 12 outings.</p> <p>Even for a player who has prompted so much discussion over his merits, it\u2019s a turnaround which raises huge question marks over his vastly contrasting fortunes on either side of the Atlantic.</p> <p>Of course, it\u2019s a considerable point of mitigation for Altidore that he was representing two toiling teams in his pair of Premier League stints \u2013 Hull were relegated in 2009-10, and Sunderland have required minor miracles to remain in the top flight over the last four seasons.</p> <p>At Toronto, he\u2019s been surrounded by two of the stand-out figures in MLS, in Michael Bradley and particularly Sebastian Giovinco. Altidore isn\u2019t coming up against the same calibre of defenders in MLS either. It\u2019s the consequences of a wage structure where the big money for designated players invariably goes on those in midfield or attack, rather than attracting top defenders from Europe.</p> <p>Justin Morrow \u2013 Toronto\u2019s most frequently used defender this season \u2013 had a base salary last year of approximately $200,000. Altidore and Giovinco were both pocketing in the region of $5m.</p> <p>Similar question marks hover over the defending in the Dutch Eredivisie, where Altidore averaged more than a goal per game for Alkmaar. There have been reservations over a string of striking imports from Holland into the Premier League \u2013 Vincent Janssen\u2019s only goal for Spurs so far coming in the League Cup after a \u00a317m summer move from Alkmaar.</p> <p>But Altidore\u2019s turnaround is not merely an indictment of poor-quality defending. </p> <p>It is a statement of how the 26-year-old can thrive, if he feels comfortable and confident in his surroundings. A combination of doubts from team-mates and supporters alike at Sunderland was hardly conducive towards that. </p> <p>He is clearly content in a US shirt, where he remains on track to eventually succeed Landon Donovan as the country\u2019s record marksman, and it\u2019s been similarly applicable for Toronto after overcoming the hamstring issues which plagued him at the start of this season.</p> <p>Altidore\u2019s goal return may not be at the levels that he managed at Alkmaar, but his all-round contribution has been transformed from the static, unreliable presence witnessed at Sunderland.</p> <p>Team-mates at Sunderland had lost all patience with Altidore\u2019s inability to hold the ball up, offer a run down the channels or gift possession away with a sloppy first touch. </p> <p>It\u2019s quite the opposite at Toronto. He\u2019s the platform for the rest of the team, particularly in offering a fulcrum for MLS player of the year Giovinco.</p> <p>The Italian\u2019s return from seven weeks on the sidelines will be pivotal towards Toronto\u2019s play-off hopes, if he can swiftly knock off the rust from his spell on the treatment table. His side\u2019s run of three defeats from five games in that period demonstrates his importance.</p> <p>Along with Altidore, the two front-players are the classic little and large strike partnership, and vastly improve Toronto\u2019s prospects of securing a first ever play-off victory next week.</p> <p>That wouldn\u2019t silence all of Altidore\u2019s detractors, but at least it would offer some redemption and demonstrate that Premier League failure has not derailed a career that can still deliver much.</p>",
  "<p>In recent weeks many people have behaved as though Theresa May has discretion to call a general election at any time. Apparently it is very easy to forget about obscure constitutional rules such as the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/14/contents/enacted\">Fixed-Term Parliaments Act</a>, which the coalition government passed in 2011. Just as Odysseus had his hands tied to the mast so that he could listen to the sirens, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/12/fixed-five-year-parliamentary-term\">coalition passed a law</a> to prevent an early election before 2015. They did so by allowing only two paths to an early election. The prime minister, and the queen, no longer have a say on their own.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/03/theresa-may-election-pm-owen-smith-corbyn\">Theresa May rules out snap UK election after \u2018shock\u2019 of Brexit vote</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One way is for parliament to vote for an early election, if two-thirds of all the members of the House of Commons (434 MPs) agree. The other way is for a simple majority, 51% of those voting, to pass a motion of no confidence in the government. The no-confidence motion has to take a specific form. A government cannot force backbenchers to agree to a bill, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_vote_of_confidence_in_the_government_of_John_Major\">as John Major did on the EU</a>, by making a vote on the bill one \u201cof confidence\u201d. If a no-confidence vote is passed, and a new government cannot be formed within two weeks (and approved in a new vote of confidence), then a general election occurs.</p> <p>Parliament can evade the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act in two ways. It can repeal the act altogether, or it can pass a new act dictating that there will be an election on a certain date and that the act will not apply. But like the no-confidence option, this also requires the vote of a majority of the House of Commons. And unlike the no-confidence vote, it has to happen on three readings of the new law. None of these scenarios is attractive to May, and none may be possible in the current parliament.</p> <p>The power dynamic in the current House of Commons and the Conservative government is shaped by the act. May has a working majority of 16 (26, if the Democratic Unionist party and Ulster Unionists are included). Therefore, any 27 Conservative MPs can ensure that this parliament remains in place until May 2020, when a general election is due under the terms of the act.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/10/ed-miliband-mps-parliamentary-vote-brexit-terms-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/56p8f\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2793759\"            data-video-name=\"Ed Miliband: MPs should vote on Brexit terms \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57fb9f5fe4b03b4fd4fa5f5b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/10/161010EdMiliband_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/10/161010EdMiliband_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/10/161010EdMiliband.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/10/ed-miliband-mps-parliamentary-vote-brexit-terms-video\">Ed Miliband: MPs should vote on Brexit terms</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Current Conservative members have a number of incentives to oppose a new election. <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/parliament/2015/05/generation-2015-introducing-the-74-new-conservative-mps.html\">Seventy-four new Conservative MPs</a> were elected in 2015. They have only had 18 months to prove that they will be good constituency MPs by holding surgeries, solving constituents\u2019 problems, voting on legislation and generally building up a record to show that they can do the job.</p> <p>Older MPs may oppose a new election on ideological grounds, either anti- or pro-Brexit. Anti-Brexiters may believe that given sufficient time, the government will find that negotiations are difficult and that the economy does not perform well under conditions of uncertainty, so they will be able to campaign for a soft Brexit in the next election. Pro-Brexit MPs may fear that there will be short-term economic dislocation that becomes obvious before an election can take place, so that remainers from other parties will be able to challenge them successfully.</p> <p>There is another element of risk. Many Conservatives\u2019 constituents voted in strong opposition to the position that the MP took in the referendum. Numerous Conservatives who campaigned to leave represent strong remain constituencies, according to the estimates of <a href=\"https://www.uea.ac.uk/ppl/people/profile/c-hanretty\">Chris Hanretty of the University of East Anglia</a>. These include <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000692\">David Burrowes</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000600\">Charlotte Leslie</a>, who have majorities of less than 5,000.

Labour will vote against it. And smaller parties such as the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party are in the delicious position of watching the Conservatives trapped in place, no matter what happens. Unless circumstances become so dire or the political culture changes sufficiently that broad, cross-party agreements are possible, the situation seems almost certain to continue.

His mother, Eva \u2013 Evelina Maria Bettina Quittner von Hudec \u2013 was a German aristocrat who had been born in Heidelberg but fled to Vienna because of her Jewish background. There she met a British soldier, Francis Burns, who became her husband. The young Pete grew very close to his mother, speaking only German and a little French until he was five, and though she developed addictions to alcohol and tranquillisers, he recalled that: \u201cI was brought up with an incredible amount of freedom and creativity.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5e3f6ca2310ffd26a8d168dd0c61db55d987d0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5e3f6ca2310ffd26a8d168dd0c61db55d987d0f/92_35_2170_1302/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pete Burns with George Galloway on Celebrity Big Brother in 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pete Burns with George Galloway on Celebrity Big Brother in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He dropped out of his Liverpool boys\u2019 school at the age of 14, after his red-dyed hair and huge earring provoked official outrage, and got a job at a record store, Probe Records, where he met numerous local musicians. He was briefly a member of the Mystery Girls alongside future Liverpudlian stars Julian Cope and Pete Wylie, before forming the Goth-influenced Nightmares in Wax in 1979. Their sole recording was the EP Birth of a Nation, including the track <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQY8LOVpZ5I\" title=\"\">Black Leather</a>, which incorporated That\u2019s The Way (I Like It). The latter was reworked by Dead Or Alive, which was the new name Burns gave to an overhauled line-up of Nightmares in Wax the following year.</p> <p>During the 90s, Dead Or Alive released several albums in various territories outside the UK, with limited success. In 1994 Burns sang and co-wrote the single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MapAHdchUjc\" title=\"\">Sex Drive</a> for the Italian techno act Glam, and that same year Burns and Coy recorded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/11/obituary-david-bowie\" title=\"\">David Bowie</a>\u2019s Rebel Rebel, calling themselves International Chrysis. Fragile (2000) was Dead Or Alive\u2019s final album of new material, though some tracks were remixes and cover versions. The new century brought the compilations Evolution: The Hits (2003) and That\u2019s The Way I Like It: The Best of Dead Or Alive (2010).</p> <p>Burns\u2019s decision to embrace reality TV came after he had spent years protesting that he would never do it (\u201cI still have a career, and I don\u2019t really do reality,\u201d he said in 2003), but his outsized personality and caustic manner made him a natural. The sight of him dancing with the politician George Galloway, both of them dressed in lycra leotards, on Celebrity Big Brother was unforgettable for any number of reasons. Burns triggered further controversy on Big Brother when he claimed to be wearing a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4631240.stm\" title=\"\">coat made of illegal gorilla skin</a>, though tests proved it was made from the skin of the colobus monkey, using pelts that pre-dated legislation outlawing their use.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0NjoEWT65A\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u0NjoEWT65A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Peter\u2019s PA on Living TV</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In 2007 Burns appeared on Big Brother\u2019s Big Mouth and Celebrity Wife Swap, where he swapped places with Leah Newman, partner of the footballer Neil \u201cRazor\u201d Ruddock. Also on the show was Burns\u2019s husband, Michael Simpson, whom he married in 2006 after his divorce from the stylist Lynne Corlett whom he had married in 1978. The three remained on good terms. In the series Pete\u2019s PA, on Living TV, contestants competed to become Burns\u2019s assistant.</p> <p>In 2015, <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/bankrupt-pete-burns-evicted-flat-5559815\" title=\"\">Burns was evicted from his London flat</a> after running up \u00a334,000 in rent arrears. Last month, Burns appeared on Channel 5\u2019s Celebrity Botched Up Bodies and talked frankly about his horrific experiences with cosmetic surgery, which had given him near-fatal blood clots and pulmonary embolisms as he underwent further procedures to try to correct mistakes.</p> <p>He is survived by Michael.</p> <p>\u2022 Peter Jozzeppi Burns, musician and television personality, born 5 August 1959; died 23 October 2016</p>",

I was reading a book by Isabel Allende, travelling around Argentina - I'm so sorry I've forgotten it - and it talked about it in depth.

It's the sort of film you want Ang Lee to make. </p> <p>I've always been interested in Chinese culture as well - it's extraordinary history, really. We've got a really gorgeous Chinese actor in the cast of Oil, and she makes these jokes about how innovative the Chinese are but how bloody minded they are within that.

I'm very strict with myself about being as honest as I can be in my acting which sounds very self-aggrandising, I don't mean it to be, but people pay a lot of money to see your work so I feel duty bound. And that can mean sometimes your heart breaks a wee bit, but you recover as with all heartbreak. </p> <p>I think by the end of the run, you just feel you can't go there again, you can't go there any more. Most of the characters I play are up against it in some way or another, but that's nothing compared with what people cope with on a daily basis, being homeless on the streets of London or whatever. So you crack on. It's hard to constantly receive news of someone's death, or that your child is in danger... sometimes you're having to tell the story of your worst nightmares. And you have to go there. But remain a level of mental health - it's a funny old business.

You have to fall in love with people you're going to be inside of for months on end, and find all their shared secrets. I did love playing St Joan, I had a massive connection with that character, I'm not sure why but I did. And I loved playing in Shameless. But it would be unfair to pick out one, because I've been so well fed - all of my characters have been delicious.</p> <p>Yeah I'd love to go back to New York.

The investigatory powers bill (IP) will, it is alleged, alter the statutory status of what is formally known as the \u201cconsolidated guidance to intelligence officers and service personnel on the detention and interviewing of detainees overseas, and on the passing and receipt of intelligence relating to detainees\u201d.<br></p> <p>Under the bill, the position of the intelligence services commissioner, who monitored the \u201cconsolidated guidance\u201d, is being abolished. The guidance is not mentioned in the bill.<br></p> <p>A spokesman for the human rights group Reprieve said: \u201cIt is alarming that the government is watering down oversight of its flagship anti-torture policy. The IP bill unravels measures taken by the previous prime minister to put oversight of UK torture policy on a legal footing. The [outgoing] intelligence services commissioner [Sir Mark Waller] has expressed concern over the absence of any reference to the torture policy \u2013 known as the \u2018consolidated guidance\u2019 \u2013 from the IP bill.</p> <p>\u201cAlong with the government\u2019s U-turn on its pledge to hold an independent, judge-led inquiry into rendition, this move shows that ministers are slipping back on the promises they made to ensure Britain would never again become complicit in torture.\u201d<br></p> <p>The issue was raised by the Liberal Democrat peer Lady Hamwee in a debate on the IP bill in the House of Lords last week. Replying for the government, the justice minister Lord Keen said monitoring would continue.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe government have already made it clear that the new investigatory powers commissioner will bring together the existing responsibilities of the intelligence services commissioner, the interception of communications commissioner and the chief surveillance commissioner,\u201d Keen said. </p> <p>\u201cThat includes oversight of the consolidated guidance on the detention and interviewing of detainees.

His aim is to \u201clift back the curtain\u201d on the parole process, which allows a group of unelected officials to have enormous influence on the criminal justice system.</p> <p>According to the Pew Charitable Trusts, one in 31 adults, or 7.3 million people, are in prison or on parole in the US. All but three state parole boards have some degree of control over prisoners\u2019 release \u2013 but almost half of all states keep parole files secret, meaning there is little accountability.</p> <p>Reamer, who has spent his life in academia and is currently a professor of social work at Rhode Island College, said he took his responsibilities seriously.</p> <p>He said deciding on parole is \u201cnot just an intellectual exercise\u201d and is something that affected him deeply: \u201cFor me, much of this work requires deep looks at the personal, the very emotional quality of these cases. This is not mental gymnastics, trying to put all of this data into in an equation and reaching a decision. There\u2019s a lot of pathos, there\u2019s a lot of emotion and a lot of tears.\u201d</p> <p>Among the cases in the book is Robert Blane, who set fire to an apartment block where he worked as a maintenance man, severely burning a five-year-old boy and his father.</p> <p>The father, Alexis Ronaldo, told the board: \u201cEvery day I stare down at my legs I am reminded of the fire.\u201d He said he cannot work, he can barely walk and watching his son experience the same agony makes him sometimes wish he died in the blaze.</p> <p>During his parole hearing Blane, a model prisoner, was told about this and started crying. He said: \u201cI feel awful. Just awful. I can\u2019t wrap my mind around the fact that I did that to another human being. No one deserves that. I hate myself for what I did. Mr Ronaldo and his son have every right to hate me and to want me to stay in prison. How can I blame them for that?\u201d</p> <p>At that hearing, Blane had only served a third of his sentence and his parole was denied.</p> <p>The case that stuck with Reamer the most was Dave Sempsrott, who became his pen pal for 30 years after they met at a support group in prison.</p> <p>Over dozens of letters, some of which Reamer shared with the Guardian, Sempsrott opened up about why in 1977, whilst high on PCP, he stabbed to death his best friend Don, Don\u2019s wife and their four-year-old daughter.</p> <p>His explanation is blunt and chilling: \u201cI cannot give you any reason as to why I committed these murders. I do not know and I don\u2019t think I ever will. I remember no argument at all; I was not mad at Don. He was my best friend. What can I say?\u201d</p> <p>On the other hand Reamer came to respect Sempsrott, who died in prison in 2013, for the letters in which he accepted what he did. \u201cI think he felt so horrible about what he had done there was a part of him that wanted the world to know how badly he felt because that didn\u2019t come out at the trial. His defence attorneys don\u2019t want you talking about that stuff. I think this was his opportunity to say to the world, I know I messed up\u201d.</p> <p>Reamer, 63, who worked as a parole board officer from 1992 until January this year, said he has a \u201cpretty good radar\u201d for when prisoners are lying.</p> <p>He cites one inmate who would take his crucifix out of his shirt so the board could see it during the interview, as if to show off his faith. \u201cThere will always be a certain type of inmate who is so manipulative, so cunning I would never vote to parole, but that\u2019s not the norm. Most people admit their guilt and want to work on their issues,\u201d Reamer said.</p> <p>Sometimes, however, Reamer was fooled or he simply made the wrong call, and a prisoner would reoffend after being released. During his 24 years on the job, he decided on around 25,000 cases and whilst he did not let anyone out to kill again, some criminals committed offenses like domestic violence and assault. Reamer calls such eventualities one of \u201cinherent risks of this kind of work\u201d and a risk we should accept.</p> <p>\u201cThe only way to prevent that happening is to never release anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a fact of life, I\u2019m not happy about it, that some of these are not going to have good endings but on balance a system where people earn their way out of prison ... I truly believe in the long run enhances public safety\u201d.</p> <p>Reamer says that from his experience, Rhode Island parole board officers were diligent, but across the US the parole system has faced criticism.</p> <p>A months long investigation by the<a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/07/10/life-without-parole#.zcbZNura1\"> Marshall Project</a> found that most boards are secretive, unaccountable and overly cautious. A recent update of the Model Penal Code, which is written by respected legal scholars, said that parole boards were \u201cfailed institutions\u201d.</p> <p>Reamer says that he did not think it was fair to make such a sweeping statement because there is a lot of variation within parole boards across the US.</p> <p>Unlike many other states Rhode Island publishes its parole board minutes and provides <a href=\"http://www.doc.ri.gov/administration/planning/statistics_reports.php\">data</a> on how many prisoners are being set free each month. But Reamer admits that in his 24 years on the job nobody was fired by the Rhode Island governor, who was technically their supervisor.</p> <p>\u201cIs there a great deal of room for improvement? Yes. Are some boards too conservative? Yes. Are some risk averse? I\u2019m willing to believe that.\u201d</p> <p>Another criticism of parole boards is that they are stuffed with friends of the state governors or a reward to big donors.</p> <p>On this Reamer is his most outspoken. \u201cThese are not positions that should be left to the governor\u2019s friends or those who contributed to the campaign. There\u2019s just too much at stake here. It\u2019s unconscionable to appoint people who do not have the expertise, it\u2019s absolutely unconscionable and does it happen? I imagine it does.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The banana is the world\u2019s most popular fruit crop, with over 100m metric tons produced annually in over 130 tropical and subtropical countries. Edible bananas are the result of a genetic accident in nature that created the seedless fruit we enjoy today.

The vast worldwide monoculture of genetically identical plants leaves the Cavendish intensely vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Fungal diseases severely devastated the banana industry once in history and it could soon happen again if we do not resolve the cause of these problems. Plant scientists, including us, are working out the genetics of wild banana varieties and banana pathogens as we try to prevent a Cavendish crash.</p> <p>One of the most prominent examples of genetic vulnerability comes from the banana itself. Up until the 1960s, Gros Michel, or \u201cBig Mike,\u201d was the prime banana variety grown in commercial plantations. Big Mike was so popular with consumers in the west that the banana industry established ever larger monocultures of this variety. Thousands of hectares of tropical forests in Latin America were converted into vast Gros Michel plantations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jan/12/what-cane-toads-taught-queenslands-banana-growers-about-defeating-a-deadly-fungus\">On the brink: Queensland\u2019s banana growers live in fear of a deadly fungus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Big Mike\u2019s popularity led to its doom, when a pandemic whipped through these plantations during the 1950s and \u201860\u2019s. A fungal disease called Fusarium wilt or Panama disease nearly wiped out the Gros Michel and brought the global banana export industry to the brink of collapse. A soil-borne pathogen was to blame: the fungus infected the plants\u2019 root and vascular system. Unable to transport water and nutrients, the plants wilted and died.</p> <p>Fusarium wilt is very difficult to control \u2013 it spreads easily in soil, water and infected planting material. Fungicide applications in soil or in the plant\u2019s stem are as of yet ineffective. Moreover, the fungus can persist in the soil for several decades, thus prohibiting replanting of susceptible banana plants.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Yearly, it can take 50 or more applications of chemicals to control the disease</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cavendish bananas are resistant to those devastating Fusarium wilt strains, so were able to replace the Gros Michel when it fell to the disease. Despite being less rich in taste, and despite the logistical challenges involved with merchandising this fruit to international markets at an acceptable quality, Cavendish eventually replaced Gros Michel in commercial banana plantations. The <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/est/COMM_MARKETS_MONITORING/Bananas/Documents/Banana_Information_Note_2014-_rev.pdf\">entire banana industry</a> was restructured, and to date, Cavendish accounts for <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5102e/y5102e04.htm\">47% of the bananas grown worldwide</a> and <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/01/10/we-have-no-bananas\">99% of all bananas sold commercially for export</a> to developed countries.</p> <p>But the Cavendish unfortunately has its own weaknesses \u2013 most prominently susceptibility to a disease called Black Sigatoka. The fungus <em>Pseudocercospora fijiensis</em> attacks the plants\u2019 leaves, causing cell death that affects photosynthesis and leads to a reduction in fruit production and quality. If Black Sigatoka is left uncontrolled, banana yields can decline by <a href=\"http://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/intropp/lessons/fungi/ascomycetes/Pages/BlackSigatoka.aspx\">35-50%</a>.</p> <p>Cavendish growers currently manage Black Sigatoka through a combination of pruning infected leaves and applying fungicides. Yearly, it can take 50 or more applications of chemicals to control the disease. Such heavy use of fungicides has negative impacts on the environment and the occupational health of the banana workers, and increases the costs of production. It also helps select for survival the strains of the fungus with higher levels of resistance to these chemicals: as the resistant strains become more prevalent, the disease gets harder to control over time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46c135c137d451e594c499add2c86b27b2c6a4cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46c135c137d451e594c499add2c86b27b2c6a4cc/0_52_3600_2161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A crop duster plane sprays fungicide over a banana plantation in the southern Philippine island of Mindanao.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A crop duster plane sprays fungicide over a banana plantation in the southern Philippine island of Mindanao.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romeo Gacad/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To further aggravate the situation, Cavendish is also now under attack from a recently emerged strain of Fusarium oxysporum, known as Tropical race 4 (TR4). First identified in the early 1990s in Taiwan, Malaysia and Indonesia, TR4 has since spread to many south-east Asian countries and on into the Middle East and Africa. If TR4 makes it to Latin America and the Caribbean region, the export banana industry in that part of the world could be in big trouble.</p> <p>Cavendish varieties have shown little if any resistance against TR4. Growers are relying on temporary solutions \u2013 trying to <a href=\"http://www.promusa.org/Fusarium+wilt\">prevent it</a> from entering new regions, using clean planting materials and limiting the transfer of potentially infected soil between farms.</p> <p>Black Sigatoka and Panama disease both cause serious production losses and are difficult to control. With the right monitoring in place to rapidly intervene and halt their spread, the risks and damage imposed by these diseases can be considerably reduced, as has been <a href=\"http://www.musalit.org/seeMore.php?id=14394\">recently shown in Australia</a>. But current practices don\u2019t provide the durable solution that\u2019s urgently needed.</p> <p>If there\u2019s a lesson to be learned from the sad history of Gros Michel, it\u2019s that reliance on a large and genetically uniform monoculture is a risky strategy that is prone to failure. To reduce the vulnerability to diseases, we need more genetic diversity in our cultivated bananas.</p> <p>Over a thousand species of banana have been recorded in the wild. Although most do not have the desired agronomic characteristics \u2013 such as high yields of seedless, non-acidic fruits with long shelf life \u2013 that would make them a direct substitute for the Cavendish, they are an untapped genetic resource. Scientists could search within them for resistance genes and other desirable traits to use in engineering and breeding programs.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If there\u2019s a lesson to be learned, it\u2019s that reliance on a large and genetically uniform monoculture is a risky strategy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To date, though, there\u2019s been little effort and insufficient funding for collecting, protecting, characterizing and utilizing wild banana genetic material. Consequently, while almost every other crop used for food production has been significantly improved through plant breeding over the last century, the banana industry has yet to benefit from genetics and plant breeding.</p> <p>But we have started taking the first steps. We now know the <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature11241\">genome sequences of the banana</a> and the fungi that cause Fusarium wilt and Sigatoka. These studies helped illuminate some of the molecular mechanisms by which these fungal pathogens cause disease in the banana. That knowledge provides a basis for identifying disease-resistant genes in wild and cultivated bananas.</p> <p>Researchers now have the tools to <a href=\"https://www.google.co.in/patents/WO2011005090A1?cl=en\">identify resistance genes</a> in wild bananas or other plant species. Then they can use classical plant breeding or genetic engineering to transfer those genes into desired cultivars. Scientists can also use these tools to further study the dynamics and evolution of banana pathogens in the field, and monitor changes in their resistance to fungicides.</p> <p>Availability of the latest tools and detailed genome sequences, coupled with long-term visionary research in genetics, engineering and plant breeding, can help us keep abreast of the pathogens that are currently menacing the Cavendish banana. Ultimately we need to increase the pool of genetic diversity in cultivated bananas so we\u2019re not dependent on single clones such as the Cavendish or the Gros Michel before it. Otherwise we remain at risk of history repeating itself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"counter\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/64206/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic&quot; alt=&quot;The Conversation&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><em>This article originally appeared on <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us\">The Conversation</a></em></p>",

  "<p>The government\u2019s decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/oct/25/heathrow-gatwick-airport-expansion-decision-day-politics-live\">back a third runway</a> at Heathrow has been informed by a mishmash of misinformation and missing information. To take just one example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/interactive/2013/dec/16/uk-runways-business-flights-interactive\">business flights are in decline</a>. They\u2019ve been in decline for years. And yet the debate is conducted as though they were not only increasing, but increasing at a rate that our current infrastructure is unable to cater for, and our economy is suffering as a result. But they\u2019re not, they\u2019re declining.</p> <p>Here\u2019s another. Heathrow can\u2019t afford to expand with its own money. Surface access costs for Heathrow are only affordable with a huge subsidy from the taxpayer. Heathrow will only pay \u00a31bn for the additional road and rail links required to get the extra passengers to and from Heathrow. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/04/24/heathrow-runway-will-create-16bn-burden-for-transport-for-london/\">Transport for London say it will cost \u00a318bn</a>. Anyone see a small discrepancy?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/oct/25/heathrow-gatwick-airport-expansion-decision-day-politics-live\">Heathrow expansion: Zac Goldsmith to resign over third runway decision - live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There may be general, underlying sociological trends which explain why the big issues of our time are decided on the basis of incomplete and misleading information, but with the runway argument there is an additional reason. We privatised the decision. By turning it into a competition between Heathrow and Gatwick lobbyists, we allowed the debate to be conducted by two parties that both firmly agreed that building a new runway in the south-east should be the nation\u2019s top priority.</p> <p>They were both happy to point out the relative flaws in their rival\u2019s plans, but are equally content to ignore any flaws which affect both. The media accepted the framing, and so despite extensive coverage, the biggest, most important flaw has been missing from the debate. The BBC has covered Heathrow on all of its flagship news and politics shows \u2013 Newsnight, the Daily Politics, the Today Programme \u2013 without even touching on the main issue.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to miss something that\u2019s invisible, silent, odourless and tasteless. Particularly when you have a strong financial incentive to do so. And the entire aviation industry has a very strong financial incentive to ignore CO<sub>2</sub>. They\u2019ve been successfully ignoring it for decades, and last month\u2019s UN-affiliated <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj66OTJ3PXPAhWL2ywKHeQwBroQFgg2MAI&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wai.org%2F16conference%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNHuouCDiTeMbx8ubSVyxNlSDI01sw&amp;sig2=GNXzr3IPawyHqU3YT2sKtg\">international aviation conference</a> made it abundantly clear that it is content to continue with its current approach.</p> <p>Unfortunately, there are no imminent technologies that, in the short to medium term, will make aviation a low-carbon industry. The only feasible way to significantly reduce aviation\u2019s impact on the climate is to <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231014004889\">significantly reduce aviation</a>.</p> <p>The Climate Change Act requires the UK economy to reduce its emissions by 80% from 1990 levels, by 2050. Aviation is allowed to increase its emissions by 120% from 1990 levels. They are on course to exceed that 120% without any new runways. So how will building a new runway in the south-east reduce the number of flights down to a level consistent with that target? Unsurprisingly, it won\u2019t. In fact, entirely predictably, it will hugely increase flights and emissions.</p> <p>Or so a naive observer might think. The serious players in this debate have a different answer to that question. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/airports-commission\">The Davies commission</a>, that entirely independent and impartial inquiry into what colour Heathrow\u2019s third runway should be, has said that it will fit within the UK\u2019s carbon budget. So that\u2019s that, issue resolved. Except, it won\u2019t explain how. This reluctance encompasses the majority who don\u2019t understand how <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjds_K43fXPAhXHBiwKHSUIAjoQqQIIHzAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fenvironment%2F2016%2Foct%2F23%2Foverwhelming-case-for-heathrow-expansion-says-commission-chair&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQ9h8IXZqqHsxcCpWTTqkONaIYqw&amp;sig2=3wyykt_k-PLIdBtRKtjmxQ\">Sir Howard Davies</a> came to such a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/01/airports-commission-case-for-heathrow-expansion-opaque\">counterintuitive conclusion</a>, and the small minority who understand all too well.</p> <p>Davies\u2019 \u201csolution\u201d exists as fragments scattered through his 600-page multi-volume report in an as obscure and obfuscatory manner as he could manage. It\u2019s designed, very effectively, not to be understood. It consists primarily of demand-control measures, primarily carbon taxes. Davies is saying (or rather whispering in pig Latin with a paper bag on his head) that we can build a new runway that has the specific purpose of increasing flights so long as we increase the price of those flights so much that demand drops to a level that reduces the number of flights overall. There are two ways to interpret this \u201csolution\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/local-residents-on-heathrows-third-runway-kids-love-the-planes\">Local residents on Heathrow's third runway: 'I would lose my house, community and friends'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One is to accept that everyone is on the level. The new runway will be built, flights will increase, the emissions from aviation will soar ever higher above their target level, and then the government will introduce a carbon tax or similar instrument which will be so punitive, adding hundreds of pounds to every ticket, that demand will drop dramatically back to levels not seen for 40 years. The consequence would be a severe scaling back, or perhaps even closure of airports, in poorer regions of Britain, but not, perhaps, in west London. According to this interpretation, the new runway is not an attempt to increase capacity at all, but to move existing capacity south. And this is in some way a good and useful thing that we should spend billions of public money to support.</p> <p>The other plausible interpretation is that Davies\u2019 plan for hitting aviation\u2019s carbon targets isn\u2019t really serious. So, the plan for demand-control measures was seen as a necessary thing to have for legal purposes, in order to get the runway built, but was always known to be just as daft as it sounds, and that\u2019s why it was effectively hidden from view.</p> <p>I\u2019m not certain which is more cynical, the idea that the government is willing to spend taxpayers\u2019 money to redistribute mobility from the poor to the rich, or the idea that Davies\u2019 report is designed to be a black box that allows aviation to expand so long as no one looks inside, an invisible solution to an invisible problem. Unfortunately, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/13/august-ties-with-july-as-hottest-month-on-record\">the invisible problem is real</a>.</p>",

Well, in 1876, the election actually was rigged, and the aftermath of that contest sheds light on what could happen in America in the next few years.</p> <p>The 1876 election pitted New York\u2019s Democratic governor, Samuel J Tilden, against Rutherford B Hayes, the former Republican governor of Ohio. On election night, some southern states, including Florida and Louisiana, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=wUMiCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=tilden%20florida%20south%20carolina&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q=tilden%20florida%20south%20carolina&amp;f=false\">tried to throw the election to Hayes</a>, even though it was clear that Tilden was winning.

I\u2019m sure someone can pop down to grab one of Trump Tower\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/05/donald-trump-taco-bowl-i-love-hispanics-picture\">famous taco bowls</a>.</p> <p>But there is no discernible entertainment value to be had in Live from Trump Tower, unless your idea of a good time is significantly less professional than InfoWars, but with fewer insane people removing articles of clothing.</p> <p>A visible effort was made to mimic the look and feel of cable news, down to the hypnotic scroll of propaganda and stretched truths: the Las Vegas Review-Journal has endorsed Donald Trump! Don\u2019t worry that the paper is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/23/sheldon-adelson-trump-super-pac-donation-25-million\">owned by one of Trump\u2019s biggest donors</a> and that this is his only major newspaper endorsement! </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-tv-media-empire-ailes\">Trump TV: is his campaign laying the groundwork for the next media empire?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I found myself momentarily hypnotized. The only thing that could break the spell was the conspicuous sound of the iPad filming this debacle receiving a Skype call. I hope it was Roger Ailes asking where his production budget went.</p> <p>The actual program involved Epshteyn and Sims sitting at a table inside Trump\u2019s campaign office, trading catchphrases and conspiracy theories \u2013 the liberal media is hiding the truth, drain the swamp, Twitter is an accurate accounting of the American electorate, Hillary sent people dressed as ducks to incite violence at Trump rallies \u2013 until the loose segments peter out and are replaced by clips of the orange candidate popping a blood vessel over Obamacare. </p> <p>The backdrop of boxes, loose papers and telephones gives it all the flavor of a dire PBS telethon or a sparsely attended youth group meeting in the basement of a Lutheran church. </p> <p>First, Epshteyn and Sims thoroughly hashed out the story of Clinton supporter Terry McAuliffe donating to the campaign of an FBI official, and then chastised Hillary Clinton for the way in which she earned her sizable wealth. Sims then threw to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/23/tomi-lahren-conservative-white-power-barbie\">Tomi Lahren, a 24-year-old blonde woman and host for the conservative multimedia network The Blaze</a> who recently compared the Black Lives Matter movement to the Ku Klux Klan. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/16/jimmy-fallon-messes-up-trumps-famous-hairdo-on-the-tonight-show-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5393a\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2722906\"            data-video-name=\"Jimmy Fallon messes up Trump's famous hairdo on The Tonight Show \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57db87b5e4b05caf65ecdb77\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/16/160916trumptussled_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572817&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572817&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/16/jimmy-fallon-messes-up-trumps-famous-hairdo-on-the-tonight-show-video\">Who needs to go on the Tonight show when you have your own media empire?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>If Ailes and Trump tried to clone Megyn Kelly and remove her sense of decency and desire to be taken seriously within the mainstream of popular culture, they still couldn\u2019t do as fine a job as Lahren has done herself.

In lieu of any good news, the gang falls back on the reliable and the battle-tested: Trump is a popular public figure. </p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s kind of like a rock star in a way,\u201d Spicer says. Rock stars pack houses, after all, just like Trump. Isn\u2019t that all that matters? Shouldn\u2019t we decide our elections based on fleeting computerized social interactions or the number of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mitchellvii/status/789647564983373826\">Halloween costumes sold</a>? If I had to choose a rock star to be president, I might go with a more benevolent, coffeehouse option \u2013 say, Dave Matthews or one of the Indigo Girls. </p> <p>The thing is, Spicer is right. Trump is a rock star, of a sort. He feeds off a cult of personality, sells merchandise with his name on it, spouts easy-to-remember catchphrases and plays to the crowd. Instead of humping a mic stand or destroying a guitar, he <a href=\"https://youtu.be/15Qc8h38Rb4?t=22\">hugs the flag</a> or demands his opponent be arrested for treason. </p> <p>As potent as that brand is, Trump cannot be on Trump TV all 24 hours of the day. At most, he\u2019ll be a mascot for the channel, not unlike Oprah on OWN \u2013 hosting a show or two and appearing in adverts. The viewership dipped to 35,300 people at 7pm, once people realized the show would be people agreeing with each other for a half-hour. </p> <p>The main event, a Trump rally in Florida, ended the grand experiment, and, slowly, viewers came back to see their spray-tanned hero pontificate. Instead of CNN or Fox News, Trump TV might want to take a cue from another infotainment outlet taking advantage of their viewers\u2019 fears and prejudices: the Trinity Broadcasting Network. </p> <p>Paul and Jan Crouch of TBN made millions of dollars allowing sweaty people like Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker scream about sin and redemption, the wrath of the lord and the literal price of salvation. TBN lasted after Jim Bakker was arrested and convicted of fraud, because the message has to be more important than the man. One day, Trump and his media empire will face the same challenge he\u2019s issuing to Fox News \u2013 someone more extreme, more charismatic and more willing to incite their followers, unless Trump can check his ego and hire that person instead. Not likely.</p> <p>I tuned out after Trump\u2019s sensual massage of Old Glory, but I\u2019m happy to report that Spicer got to eat. \u201cI did see there\u2019s food coming,\u201d Epshteyn said, glancing over at the room behind him. On the walls of that room were multiple mounted televisions, which the hosts said were always tuned to cable news, the target of their scorn. If they intend to join them on that wall, they might want to try harder. Start by feeding the guests.</p>",
  "<p>E-cigarettes might help smokers who are quitting keep the pounds off, say researchers, suggesting that vaping could be harnessed in the fight against obesity.</p> <p>Weight gain is a major concern among smokers looking to quit. On average individuals put on 5kg in the first year they go without cigarettes. Nicotine is known to suppress appetite and increase metabolic rate, among other effects.</p> <p>While nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) can help to control weight gain and help smokers to quit, researchers have suggested that nicotine-containing e-cigarettes might be a better option. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/sifting-the-evidence/2016/sep/14/why-cant-scientists-agree-on-e-cigarettes-vaping\">Why can't scientists agree on e-cigarettes?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cPeople can change their nicotine content, so to quit smoking they might start off on a higher strength e-liquid and then they can taper down really quite gradually in a much more sophisticated way than they can with NRT, which is probably good for weight maintenance and for weight loss,\u201d said co-author Linda Bauld, professor of health policy at the University of Stirling and deputy director of the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies.

They highlight a number of avenues that should be explored, from trials into the effects of vaping on weight gain among smokers attempting to quit, to the impact of different e-liquids on feelings of fullness.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not suggesting that we should promote e-cigarettes to people who haven\u2019t smoked,\u201d said Bauld. \u201cBut for people who are thinking about the best way to stop smoking and are concerned about weight gain, I think what we are suggesting is that e-cigarettes should certainly be considered.\u201d <br></p> <p>Paul Aveyard, professor of behavioural medicine at the University of Oxford, said it was \u201calmost certain\u201d that nicotine-containing e-cigarettes would reduce weight gain among smokers attempting to quit. But, he cautioned, the possible benefits of e-cigarettes in managing weight gain among ex-smokers did not mean that they could benefit non smokers\u2019 attempts to lose weight.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, he added, with some evidence that nicotine could play a role in the development of diabetes, there may be down sides to the use of such devices, even if they do help smokers keep the weight off. \u201cThat balance between the two effects is not known,\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>Amanda Sandford, from Action on Smoking and Health said: \u201cThe risk of putting on weight when quitting smoking is a common concern and can discourage smokers from trying to stop. E-cigarettes are a safer alternative to tobacco and if they can also help people avoid piling on the pounds as well as helping them to stop smoking that is a real bonus.\u201d</p>",

In fact, a global protest was called for in solidarity with Aleppo in all the world capitals for the first weekend of October, but the message didn\u2019t reach enough people. The protests need to continue until the bombing of innocent people in Aleppo is stopped.</p> <p>In Poland recently thousands of people mobilised for abortion rights. The new labour reforms in France outraged masses of people enough to take to the streets, and 40,000 people bothered to demonstrate against a new airport in Nantes that would destroy rural land. Have we really become so selfish that we only react when we are personally affected? Bashar al-Assad and Vladimir Putin need to be stopped, and the least we can do is to show the people of Aleppo that we will not sit placidly by.</p> <p>Whoever is to blame, whether or not we can stop the bombing, we should be demonstrating in our thousands to show the Syrian people that we care. Or have we become so desensitised that we consider genocide acceptable?<br><strong>Belinda Smith</strong><br>Rostrenen, France</p> <p>\u2022 The Guardian Weekly has been publishing stories about the sheer horror of the bombing of Aleppo by the Syrian-Russia alliance. There are many who say that this alliance is committing war crimes, and Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de wonders why there are no huge demonstrations.</p> <p>We know that the west won\u2019t play the role of global policeman this time, because the global nuclear powers are on either side of the divide. There is little that can militarily be done in such a situation.</p> <p>As a matter of fact, I really don\u2019t understand why there are still so-called rebels in Syria. What do they hope? Aren\u2019t they realising that they have no chance to overthrow Bashar al-Assad? When will they flee at last and when will we, the west, stop military support to their lost cause? Any armed rebel in Syria, either extremist or moderate, is now partly responsible for the enduring plight of the Syrian civilians.<br><strong>Marc Jachym</strong><br>Les Ulis, France</p> <h2><strong>Dangers to the environment</strong><br></h2> <p>Now that the Paris agreement has passed, we have hopes that governments will enforce guidelines so that we can cut our global carbon emissions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/07/paris-agreement-climate-change-carbon-emissions\" title=\"\">(14 October)</a>. But I can\u2019t help but wonder how much we, as individuals, could help reduce pollution and emissions. I think back to what I\u2019ve read about the second world war, where every citizen was expected to do their bit to contribute to the cause. Here where I live many drivers leave their cars running when they stop to let their passengers run into a store, or to check their email or just to listen to their radios. I\u2019ve witnessed many incidents of up to half an hour with engines running. And, of course, many of these cars are huge SUVs or enormous pickup trucks. Walking behind them is an invitation to uncontrolled coughing from the pollution.</p> <p>I can think of dozens of other aspects of our lifestyles that could be curtailed to help the effort. It is everyone\u2019s responsibility to act responsibly and not just assume that the government will do it all.<br><strong>Diana Smith</strong><br>Arlington, Virginia, US</p> <p>\u2022 The Discovery section of 7 October provides one more reason to believe the adage that every cloud has a silver lining. Reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/24/lobsters-climate-change-oceans-marine-life-seafood-research\" title=\"\">Climate change could take lobsters off menus</a>, I unabashedly divulge, brought on a perverse sense of relief. For I am allergic to lobsters, and beholding others who are not arouses gnawing envy in me: envy of their charging appetites; of how they assert mastery of the fate of the crustacean; of the pleasure they have delivering out of brittle armour dear morsels of flesh, and enriching them further in baths of golden melted butter.</p> <p>But if lobsters become extinct, those now-enviable gourmands too would irrevocably be deprived of their pleasure, but for reasons different from mine. Indeed, popular adage then could glibly declare also that heartless gloating at the misfortune of others is the cure for envy.<br><strong>Jack Aslanian</strong><br>Oakland, California, US</p> <h2><strong>Robots will rule the world</strong><br></h2> <p>Futurist, scientist, and begetter of the Gaia hypothesis James Lovelock predicts that one day robots will take over the planet, an eventuality that others also warn us about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/30/james-lovelock-interview-by-end-of-century-robots-will-have-taken-over\" title=\"\">(14&#xa0;October)</a>. But if computer chips with arms and legs do triumph they, like us, as Decca Aitkenhead\u2019s profile of the 97-year-old Lovelock reminds us, will also apply the same \u201cindependent volition and intuition\u201d to real life that we their inventors now enjoy, but which, alas, have often misled us.</p> <p>And robots, if at last they do emerge as our replacements, will also be victims like us of the same ecological, earthbound catastrophes that we, their creators, may have already, willingly or unwillingly, set into motion.<br><strong>Richard Orlando</strong><br>Westmount, Quebec, Canada</p> <p>\u2022 I was very interested in James Lovelock\u2019s idea that humans will be overpowered by electronics. I am quite sure he is right in his assumption that electronics will supersede man in evolutionary terms.</p> <p>However, I feel that humans will survive in small pockets of the world: in remote places in the rainforests in South America and also perhaps among the indigenous peoples of Australia and New Zealand who are uncontaminated by modern electronics. These people will pose no threat to \u201celectronic humans\u201d and so will not need to be wiped out.<br><strong>Alan Morley</strong><br>Bryn Dyffryn, UK</p> <h2><strong>Planetary exploration</strong><br></h2> <p>Ian Sample quotes Jan Woerner, director general of the European Space Agency: \u201cI can tell you that the moon village is my favourite solution for the future\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/23/is-a-moon-village-the-next-step-for-space-exploration-esas-chief-thinks-so\" title=\"\">(7 October)</a>. What problem is Woerner wanting to solve? It certainly isn\u2019t colonialism. He can\u2019t be referring to the terrestrial need to devote vast sums of money and intelligence to the problem of environmental degradation.</p> <p>Surely, he\u2019s not concerned about the dearth of good reality TV. Maybe it\u2019s the dilemma of getting a tiny percentage of the human population off the planet before we render it incapable of supporting the rest of us.<br><strong>Bob Sherrin</strong><br>Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada</p> <p>\u2022 Nasa\u2019s Jeff Hoffman says: \u201cIt has been nearly 50 years since we explored a planetary surface.\u201d I do it daily.<br><strong>David Josephy</strong><br>Guelph, Ontario, Canada</p> <h2><strong>Aliens may not be hostile</strong><br></h2> <p>I am the first to acknowledge that Stephen Hawking\u2019s brain is 100 times smarter than mine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/23/stephen-hawking-warns-against-seeking-out-aliens-in-new-film\" title=\"\">(7 October)</a>. However, unless he has had communications with advanced civilisations that he is not sharing, I find his comments about possibly \u201chostile aliens\u201d simply adding to the fear that already appears to run our world to the detriment of all.</p> <p>Isn\u2019t it possible that advanced beings might have got the hang of qualities like love and compassion, which we may experience in our lives but seem hopelessly inadequate at projecting into political matters? Might not such advanced beings be able to show us the way out of our greed and selfishness, rather than wish to obliterate us?</p> <p>Of course, they might see us as impediments to the harmonious functioning of the universe and feel we need to go. If so, who could blame them?<br><strong>Ann Milston</strong><br>Forres, UK</p> <h2><strong>Briefly</strong><br></h2> <p>\u2022 Natalie Kon-yu bemoans the Nobel award to Bob Dylan and not to a woman, particularly \u201cof colour\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/14/bob-dylans-nobel-prize-isnt-radical-hes-just-another-white-male-writer\" title=\"\">(21 October)</a>.

Perhaps even a stringent concentration in school education on the benefits and pitfalls of democracy and of the recognition that free discussion of differing views should be welcome, not feared, might not work either.

Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson wins the support of 3% of likely voters nationwide, while Green candidate Jill Stein is supported by 2% of likely voters. The margin between Clinton and Trump has remained steady since late September.</p> <p>The survey, conducted between October 20-23, shows that 86% of likely voters say that they have made up their minds regarding the impending general election, with only 14% telling CNN that they\u2019re swayable.</p> <p>Asked to name their preferred candidate on the issues, voters sided with Clinton on almost every category, including terrorism, foreign policy, immigration, and the nomination of supreme court justices. Only on the economy did Trump claim a majority of likely voters\u2019 endorsement, 51% to Clinton\u2019s 47%.</p> <p>Regarding the candidates\u2019 personal attributes, Clinton\u2019s lead over Trump stretched into the double digits: 61% of likely voters say that Clinton has the better temperament to serve as president, with only 32% of voters saying the same of Trump. </p> <p>The margin of error for the poll\u2019s results is plus or minus 3 percentage points.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-24T20:31:32.801Z\">at 9.31pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-580e6a1ce4b0219a00d38196\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-24T20:17:23.618Z\">9.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">GOP senator re-endorses Donald Trump after Access Hollywood tape dust settles</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Republican senator Mike Crapo has made an abrupt about-face following his un-endorsement of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, declaring in a <a href=\"http://crapoforsenate.com/senator-crapo-says-will-vote-trump-president/\">statement released by his reelection campaign</a> that he will vote for the embattled nominee despite the release of a video in which he bragged about sexually assaulting women.</p> <p>\u201cThe choice we still have today and the choice we will have is between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton,\u201d Crapo said. \u201cGiven that choice, I will vote for the Republican ticket: Trump and [vice presidential nominee Mike] Pence.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/08/donald-trumps-sex-boasts-when-you-are-a-star-they-let-you-do-anything-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/56ffv\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2786643\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump's sex boasts: 'When you are a star they let you do anything' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"NBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57f87665e4b0e4aaeaa8d24b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/08/161008TrumpUpdate2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/08/161008TrumpUpdate2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/08/161008TrumpUpdate2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/08/donald-trumps-sex-boasts-when-you-are-a-star-they-let-you-do-anything-video\">Donald Trump\u2019s sex boasts: \u2018When you are a star they let you do anything\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>After the release of a 2005 video that showed Trump bragging to an entertainment reporter that his fame allowed him to grab women\u2019s genitals with impunity, Crapo had called for Trump to drop out of the race in favor of Pence.</p> <p>\u201cI can no longer endorse Donald Trump,\u201d Crapo said at the time. \u201cThis is not a decision that I have reached lightly, but his pattern of behavior has left me no choice.

  "<p>The students gathered on a three-hour \u201cfive ways to improve your wellbeing\u201d course in south London are about to have a powerful realisation. </p> <p>One of the group is asked to think about how many hours a week she spends seeing healthcare professionals, such as health visitors or psychiatrists, about her mental health condition. </p> <p>She tots up the amount of hours each week and multiplies it by 52. It comes to just under two full days. Stella Williams, the course\u2019s peer trainer, points out that for 363 days she has managed her condition all by herself.</p> <p>For the group of students, who are all either current or former patients at the South West London and St George\u2019s mental health NHS trust and now taking courses at the onsite Recovery College, this realisation that they look after themselves for such a large part of the year, makes them smile with pride. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I can\u2019t talk to my son or husband because they don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about but people here do</p> <footer> <cite>Clara Jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Launched in 2010, there are now over 50 courses in the shiny prospectus belonging to the Recovery College situated in the grounds of Springfield University hospital that are attended by around 150 people a week. They range from providing information about specific diagnoses (for example, understanding personality disorder), to teaching coping tools such as journaling or mindfulness. There are also courses specifically for carers, families and friends.</p> <p>Clara Jones, a mother of one, has severe anxiety and depression and admits that being at the college is the very last place she really wants to be. \u201cIf I had my way, I\u2019d be at home in my bedroom with the curtains drawn and the door closed. But I make myself come because it gives me the feeling of not being alone and that helps. It took a lot of courage for me to come to the first class,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Each course is co-produced and co-facilitated by a peer trainer who is someone with lived experience of a mental health issue, and a practitioner trainer, who is a mental health professional. </p> <p>For Jones, who is one of the 2,700 people to have attended since the Recovery College opened, one of the best things about coming to the college, is knowing she isn\u2019t alone. \u201cPeople say wise things without even knowing and no one cares if I\u2019m not saying anything. I can\u2019t talk to my son or husband because they don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, but people here do.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/sep/21/debt-homelessness-domestic-violence-gp-practice-acting-one-stop-shop\">Debt, homelessness, domestic violence: the GP practice acting as a one-stop shop</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last week the students learned about how staying active can improve their mental health. One student, Steph Bates, an artist who has obsessive compulsive disorder, tells the group about how she had braved going swimming for the first time in years and how much it had lifted her mood. </p> <p>Peer trainer Peter Wilson says watching his students build confidence like this is the best thing about his job. \u201cWe were running a course about being assertive and in the second week a girl had had a conversation with her partner that she\u2019d wanted to have for years but hadn\u2019t been able to. It\u2019s the nature of the college.\u201d</p> <p>Wilson has been a peer trainer for a year. \u201cI was sitting on the other side of the table just two years ago, that\u2019s how recent it is. I had my own business but I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I lost it all. I then went through the learning curve and it took a while to get to where I am now.</p> <p>\u201cIn class, I draw on my raw experiences of bipolar and how I manage it. I bring that to the room so hopefully students will be inspired.\u201d </p> <p>One of his colleagues is Kevin Howell, a practitioner trainer, whose background is in psychiatric nursing. Working so closely with peer trainers is one of the most unique things about his role. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I was nervous about what experience they\u2019d have in a classroom environment,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was quite daunting being involved in a new concept and realising that I couldn\u2019t make any assumptions about my co-trainer\u2019s experience.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe had some teething problems at first, one of which was realising we needed a formal process to bring peer trainers on board so that we had confidence in their training and ability.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/oct/05/westminster-wealth-opulence-isolated-mothers-mental-health\">Westminster: wealth, opulence and socially isolated new mothers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A trainee peer trainer programme was developed. Now, Howell says he knows that his co-trainers have both the training and the experience to be a true partner in the classroom. \u201cWhat\u2019s wonderful about working with a peer trainer is that student can relate directly to them, and this brings out information in the class that I would never hear otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>Howell believes the college is so successful because they put participants at the centre of what they do. He says: \u201cStudents don\u2019t feel they\u2019re on a conveyor belt and are valued for the whole person they are. When the focus is on the individual as a whole rather than their diagnosis you see a much fuller picture.\u201d </p> <p>For Bates, who enrolled just two weeks ago, the course is already helping her manage her OCD while she waits for a bed in a residential unit. She says: \u201cIt\u2019s helpful in so many ways.

  "<p>Donald Trump may have shocked the American political establishment with his refusal to say whether he will accept the results of next month\u2019s presidential election, but he is far from the only candidate for high office in the United States who has cast serious doubt on the integrity of the system and the campaign tactics of his opponents.</p> <p>Over the past 16 years \u2013 ever since the epic, 36-day presidential showdown in Florida in 2000 that was resolved not by a full recount of the votes, but by a supreme court split along partisan lines \u2013 accusations of vote-rigging and out-and-out theft have become increasingly common among partisans on both sides, and the electoral process has become ever more politicized, rancorous and fraught with mistrust.</p> <p>\u201cI will tell you at the time,\u201d Trump said at last Wednesday\u2019s debate when asked if he would accept the election result on 8 November. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you in suspense.\u201d The Republican candidate has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/17/man-who-cried-rigged-problem-with-trump-election-claims\">that the election is \u201crigged\u201d against him</a>. \u201cOf course there is large-scale voter fraud happening on and before election day,\u201d he tweeted last week. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/donald-trump-fact-check-rigged-election-voter\">All available evidence shows</a> that in-person voter fraud is exceedingly rare.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-refuse-concede-election-electoral-college\">What would happen if Donald Trump refused to concede this election?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Opinion polls suggest that Trump\u2019s charges of a \u201crigged election\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/republicans-reject-us-election-result-hillary-clinton-win\">have struck a nerve</a>: 41% of voters believe him when he says the election could be <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/poll-41-percent-of-voters-say-the-election-could-be-stolen-from-trump-229871#ixzz4NyQ6BbyQ\">stolen</a>, according to one survey. More than two-thirds of all Republicans believe that if Hillary Clinton is declared the winner, it will be because of <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll-rigging-idUSKCN12L2O2\">illegal voting or vote-rigging</a>, according to another.</p> <p>Those attitudes are almost certainly the result of Republicans beating the drum for more than a decade about elections being skewed by the illegal participation of dead people, illegal immigrants and even the occasional household pet. To this day, many in the GOP are convinced Barack Obama was elected only because community organizing groups <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/21/acorn-prostitution-videos\">such as Acorn</a> \u2013 now defunct \u2013 registered extraordinary numbers of ineligible or nonexistent voters in the inner cities, and because busloads of Mexicans came over the border to vote using someone else\u2019s name.</p> <p>Eight years before Trump ever publicly uttered the words \u201crigged election\u201d, Obama\u2019s first Republican opponent, John McCain, said in a presidential debate that Acorn was \u201con the verge of perpetrating one of the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2008/oct/17/sorting-truth-obama-acorn/\">greatest frauds</a> in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy\u201d.

The 2004 election, which saw George W Bush re-elected despite the mounting unpopularity of the Iraq war, saw an explosion of unfounded conspiracy theories that Republicans were in cahoots with the manufacturers of electronic voting machines and would never lose an election again. (The theory fell apart as soon as Democrats retook control of the House of Representatives two years later.)</p> <p>This year, a hard core of Bernie Sanders supporters remains convinced that the senator from Vermont was cheated out of the Democratic presidential nomination by the underhanded maneuvering of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee \u2013 despite the fact that Clinton <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-system-isnt-rigged-against-sanders/\">won 3m more primary votes</a>.</p> <p>American history is hardly lacking in examples of real voter manipulation and electoral skullduggery, especially in the segregation-era deep south. To this day, the US electoral system is widely viewed as an <a href=\"http://kimalex.blogspot.com/2004/12/jimmy-carter-on-npr-air.html\">anomaly</a> in the western world because of persistent problems with the reliability of its voting machinery, frequent bureaucratic incompetence, the lack of uniform standards from state to state or even county to county, the systematic exclusion of <a href=\"http://www.sentencingproject.org/issues/felony-disenfranchisement/\">more than 6 million felons</a> and<strong> </strong>ex-prisoners, and the tendency of election officials to adopt rules that benefit their party over democracy itself.</p> <p>Until 2000, though, these issues were not widely aired in public. Then the battle over Florida ripped a veil off a dysfunctional system and offered an opportunity not just for meaningful electoral reform \u2013 a slow and frustrating process \u2013 but also for new forms of political warfare unseen since the darkest days of the segregation era in which the electoral process itself became fair game, particularly for the Republicans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7457c2bbdb7242882d04cec113b8c9a50a47473c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7457c2bbdb7242882d04cec113b8c9a50a47473c/0_0_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Attorney Nicole Pollard, Judge Charles Burton and attorney John Bolton review questionable ballots for the 2000 presidential election in Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Attorney Nicole Pollard, Judge Charles Burton and attorney John Bolton review questionable ballots for the 2000 presidential election in Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rhona Wise/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It began, perhaps, when the hand recount of punch card ballots requested by Al Gore and the Democrats \u2013 something both parties had routinely pressed for in previous contested elections \u2013 was recast by many leading Republicans in their talking points as a form of \u201c<a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0011/22/ip.00.html\">slow-motion grand larceny</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Then, in Missouri, Republican Senator Kit Bond took one look at African American voters in overcrowded precincts in St Louis casting ballots beyond the official poll closing time \u2013 something that has since become standard practice in many states \u2013 and denounced what he called a \u201c<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=122543\">major criminal enterprise</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Soon, a narrative took hold that Democrats were habitual vote-stealers \u2013 something that was indubitably true in the days of Boss Tweed in 1860s New York but now took the form of a racist dog-whistle because the voters under most suspicion were black or Latino. Within a few years, politicians such as Sarah Palin were openly distinguishing \u201c<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2008/10/rep-says-liberals-hate-real-americans-014797\">real Americans</a>\u201d \u2013 meaning white Republicans \u2013 from the rest, and states under Republican control were passing voter ID laws to crack down on a problem \u2013 voter impersonation fraud \u2013 that experts have repeatedly found to be <a href=\"http://www.pressherald.com/2016/10/18/analysis-heres-why-vote-fraud-is-less-likely-than-being-struck-by-lightning/\">rare to non-existent</a>.</p> <p>As the federal courts have now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/31/north-carolina-voting-rights-law-republicans-november-elections\">begun to find</a>, the effect of these laws has in fact been to discriminate against groups of voters \u2013 the transient, the elderly, students and the poor \u2013 who are much more likely to support Democrats.</p> <p>Given the level of mistrust, rank-and-file members of both parties have increasingly come to define democracy by the elections their side wins, and any other outcome as prima facie evidence of theft and corruption.</p> <p>Royal Masset, a former political director of the Texas Republican party, once described how he would receive <a href=\"http://blog.chron.com/texaspolitics/2007/04/a-republican-his-mother-and-voter-id/\">dozens of calls</a> from disappointed candidates after election day complaining about some unsubstantiated outrage, usually involving illegal immigrants or lightning-rod political figures such as Jesse Jackson. \u201cHuman beings do not accept defeat easily,\u201d he observed in 2007.</p> <p>If Trump is different, it is only because he began complaining about vote-rigging months before election day and because he threatens to depart from the tradition that says you fight as hard and as dirty as you want, but only until the final results come in.</p> <p>The sheer volume of his complaints, however, may be doing his prospects little good: a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/10/21/trumps-election-rigging-claim-will-backfire-heres-the-evidence/?tid=pm_politics_pop_b\">fascinating</a> American National Election Study survey conducted in 2012 shows that people are less likely to vote when their faith in the integrity of the system has been shaken, and much more likely to vote if they think the ballots are counted fairly. In other words, Trump\u2019s rhetoric may just be depressing his own turnout and making defeat all the more likely.<br></p> <ul> <li><em>Andrew Gumbel is author of Down for the Count: Dirty Elections and the Rotten History of Democracy in America</em></li> </ul>",

  "<p>Everyone knows all the best film-makers are migrating to TV. Steve McQueen, Steven Soderbergh, Martin Scorsese, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/05/woody-allen-tv-sitcom-crisis-in-six-scenes\">Woody Allen</a>, Jane Campion, David Lynch, David Fincher, the Coen brothers \u2013 the roll-call is like an Oscars invite list. But few are quite so cinematic as Paolo Sorrentino, the Italian director whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/05/le-grande-bellezza-great-beauty-review\">The Great Beauty</a> won an Academy Award in 2013 and who specialises in lush, literate epics with canvases as rich as a Caravaggio \u2013 and an awful lot of high-volume chorals.</p> <p>Yet even Sorrentino has jumped the small-screen bandwagon, making The Young Pope, a 10-part Sky/HBO/Canal+ co-production (ie, really, really expensive). He says he was inspired by True Detective and Fargo \u2013 and was sanguine about the switch. Working in the Italian movie industry, he says, has bred low expectations in him. \u201cThis puts Italian film-makers in a position of candour. In this sense, for me, working in television and cinema are the same thing: an exercise of freedom.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bc51c1931f49c8314d8663030f05581e27ae881\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bc51c1931f49c8314d8663030f05581e27ae881/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jude Law and Diane Keaton in The Young Pope.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sorrentino shows the inner struggles of \u2018the simple man chosen by fate to be Pontiff\u2019 \u2026 Jude Law and Diane Keaton in The Young Pope.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gianni Fiorito/Sky TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Set in the present day, The Young Pope stars Jude Law as newly appointed pontiff Pius XIII, formerly Lenny Belardo from America.

Sorrentino has said that he hopes the show will help people understand the inner struggles of \u201cthe simple man chosen by fate to be Pontiff\u201d. But he reserves judgement on the current holder of the office, and whether he has made people more compassionate about the challenges such a man might face.</p> <p>\u201cI do not think that a Pope has real power to change people. But I think he has the power of suggestion. In this regard, Pope Francis is doing a lot. His charisma, his words, his behaviour and his actions influence many. But besides the momentary emotion that results from this, it will take time before the power of suggestion will take root in the spirit of the people.\u201d</p> <p>The producers will hope Pius XIII finds a place in our hearts far faster.</p> <p><em>The Young Pope starts in the UK on Sky Atlantic on Thursday at 9pm, and in the US it\u2019s coming soon to HBO. </em></p>",

  "<p>Battlefield 1 is a tectonic shift for the military shooter genre. By jumping back to the first world war, developer EA Dice has not only discovered fresh game design ideas through the antiquated weaponry, it has also ensured that its game stands apart from other shooters, which have dominated disc-trays for the past 10 years. </p> <p>There are other unexpected benefits too. Battlefield 1 discovers compelling and poignant stories, effective ways to tell them, and a campaign structure that should inspire any shooter after it. The newly invigorated multiplayer warfare adds the final flourish.</p> <p>Well, not quite final. After the technical disasters that befell Battlefield 4, it is a relief to report that, well, Battlefield 1 actually works.</p> <p>Rather than one long, globe-trotting odyssey, Battlefield 1 finds rhythm with a multi-part narrative. There are six War Stories available at the start, most featuring two to five missions which focus on different characters and fronts from the 1914-18 war. There are unexpected heroes and self-serving rogues; there\u2019s a British tank regiment making its way through the dense forests of Boulon before a climactic battle at Cambrai; there\u2019s a lone American sleazebag finding himself wound up in a combat biplane above the Alps before dog-fighting above London. </p> <p>Elsewhere, a squadron of the Italian Arditi (\u2018The Daring Ones\u2019) assaults a mountainside base, while the Australian special forces act as runners through the artillery shelled coast of Gallipoli. There\u2019s even a star turn from Lawrence of Arabia fighting a seemingly futile war against enemy forces in the desert. There are only slight hints of the \u2018one man army\u2019 syndrome that so many combat shooters fall foul of \u2013 and because of this, Battlefield finds a narrative flair it\u2019s not had in years, if ever at all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae930d1a69a31ab6be0f9ebfe3777fa521a60a54\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae930d1a69a31ab6be0f9ebfe3777fa521a60a54/157_105_1625_975/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Battlefield 1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Battlefield 1</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Electronic Arts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The War Stories provide gameplay as well as scenic variety. The dense French forests demand a completely different style of play than the barren open deserts of Arabia, but Battlefield 1 makes great use of its tonal diversity, freeing you up enough to make your own decisions about how you approach objectives, and when. There\u2019s a lengthy stealth section through a French town \u2013 the sun setting as you creep through, picking up vital mechanical parts in order to repair your tank, Bess. Or, you could use your bolt-action rifle to loudly kill off a couple of German soldiers before commandeering a nearby mortar to cause a bit more havoc. It\u2019s not nearly as systematically accomplished as Metal Gear Solid V, mostly thanks to the game\u2019s dim AI, but the open-ended freedom certainly harks back to Kojima\u2019s opus.</p> <p>What this does for the stories is allow each to breathe their own pace, without needless padding. Battlefield 1 captures intense moments of spectacle and quieter moments of exposition in a way that doesn\u2019t feel elongated or drawn out. It also lets DICE convey the desperation, death and destruction of the first world war in a way no shooter has before it. Of course, no game can truly convey what war actually is but in Battlefield 1\u2019s most horrific moments it attains a truly sombre nature that feels respectful. Its opening prologue is a grim take on the enormity of the conflict \u2013 gas attacks, endless crossfire and artillery shelling make for an impactful first five-minutes \u2013 and its only real flaw is that the protagonist of this sequence, a member of the Harlem Hellfighters doesn\u2019t get seen again \u2013 at least outside of potential DLC. It\u2019s a shame considering the game\u2019s marketing.</p> <p>Cleverly, all of Battlefield 1\u2019s single player escapades act as smart but subtle learning exercises for when you hop into multiplayer. Infantry combat teaches you zone capture and control, while tank combat and dogfighting teaches you the best way to control these vehicles before you head online. Of course, a single player campaign can never quite convey the sheer complexity and inherent skill of (some) other human beings \u2013 let alone dozens of them crisscrossing their way across enormous maps \u2013 but Battlefield 1 allows you to go into a chaotic match of Conquest and not feel entirely overwhelmed.</p> <p>It\u2019s that mode, Conquest, that remains Battlefield\u2019s greatest showcase. Dice shakes up certain elements somewhat, changing around its classes to better suit the World War I setting: they\u2019re still easy to understand and fun to experiment with. The Assault class is your go-to for tank-busting and mid-range combat, while Support is perfect if you want heavier weapons without so many offensive tools at your disposal. The Medic is self explanatory but vital to any real chance of victory, and the Scout is a sniper \u2013 arguably the most fun and potentially most overpowered of the four classes.</p> <p>Every class uses a different portion of Battlefield 1\u2019s varied and unique arsenal. Series veterans might be surprised to find that the jump back 100 years hasn\u2019t changed the weapon setup too much \u2013 there are automatic rifles, useful pistols, a couple of brilliantly powerful shotguns \u2013 and it takes a little to get used to them, but not so much that you\u2019ll feel out of depth. The sniper\u2019s agonisingly slow bolt-action rifles take the longest to adjust to.</p> <p>Battlefield 1 also takes inspiration from Dice\u2019s own Star Wars Battlefront reboot, bringing a little arcade-style approachability to everything. Now, super powerful class upgrades are spawned into the map occasionally, giving you flamethrowers or heavy machine guns \u2013 it\u2019s a smart way of diversifying play enough that it feels like a thrill whenever you pick one of these up. It\u2019s not so successful with the vehicles, however. Tanks, armoured cars and the rest are no longer automatically spawned on to the map \u2013 instead, they have to be spawned in by a player. This means you lose that exhilarating rush for vehicles in spawning locations. The new system is not nearly as authentic, or as much fun to play.</p> <p>Still, the vehicular combat itself ties directly into the increased level of destructibility that now lies in every single part of Battlefield 1. There\u2019s a real adrenaline rush to pushing across a hill with a dozen squad mates, all of you charging forward as the rain batters against the sludgy mud of the Argonne Forest.</p> <p>Dice clearly understands these moments of player-driven spectacle, adding Operations as a flagship new multiplayer mode. It\u2019s essentially an elongated game of Rush, but one that factors in a narrative hook, playing multiple games of attack and defend over different maps that are set up like individual conflicts from history. These are battles that can last up to an hour, and the tension mounts as the Attackers use up their finite number of spawns, while the Defenders do their best to stop the onslaught from taking the key objective points.

It\u2019s a game type that takes the most unexpected moment of poignancy from the campaign and turns it into an entirely new Deathmatch mode \u2013 one that plays like a slightly modified version of King of the Hill \u2013 it\u2019s just that the hill is a pigeon and the pigeon is moving. Players have to grab the bird, before walking slowly or stopping entirely to write a note for it deliver. If a player is killed, the other team begin to write their note, and it\u2019s only when the progress bar has been filled that you must then fly the pigeon to a destination to score a point. It\u2019s a ludicrous concept, one with even more comical origins, but it\u2019s a worthwhile shake-up to the standard Deathmatch.</p> <p>Those subtle changes and little overhauls make all the difference, and they\u2019re wrapped up in perhaps the most beautiful first-person shooter ever made \u2013 one that captures the sludge of the trenches, the cacophony of destruction of a battlefield, and the intensity of desert standoffs and mountainside raids. Dice has taken a risk visiting a time period not seen in major multiplayer shooters before, and Battlefield aces it. This is a lavish package that capitalises on a stagnancy in the genre, offering something new, exciting and, most importantly, solid. </p> <p><strong>Electronic Arts; PC/PS4/Xbox One; \u00a340; Pegi rating: 18</strong></p>",

It must crack down on students coming here to get educated in our universities in exchange for money. It must check teenagers\u2019 teeth lest we accidentally extend compassion to a Syrian adult.</p> <p>Who are \u201cordinary hard-working people\u201d though? It seems the consensus following Brexit is that they\u2019re the marginalised white working class; the people who have been left behind by modernity, who feel alienated by the \u201cliberal metropolitan elite\u201d. I\u2019m a white man from the north-east, living in strongly Brexit-voting Middlesbrough, so you might expect me to tell you all off for looking down on us from your ivory towers. But the truth is that this outbreak of \u201cthe poor proles can\u2019t help it\u201d is both incorrect and patronising.</p> <p>The working class mostly lack our own voices in the media. Instead, we are reported on. This reporting seems, even now, to believe that the true working-class identity is, as Kelvin MacKenzie put it in the 1980s, \u201ca right old fascist\u201d. Culturally insular, not interested in or smart enough to understand real news, generally afraid of people not like him (it\u2019s always a him).</p> <p>Migrants and native people of colour are stripped of their right to a <a href=\"https://mediadiversified.org/2016/09/28/why-we-have-to-take-white-working-class-peoples-fears-seriously/\" title=\"\">working-class identity</a>, and even cast as the enemy of the \u201creal\u201d (ie white) working class. I spoke to Marsha Garratt, a working-class, mixed-race woman who heads up the <a href=\"http://www.allinyouthproject.com/aboutus\" title=\"\">All In Youth Project</a>, and she was cutting about the \u201cunderreporting of positive stories of solidarity between all members of the working class, including ethnic minorities\u201d. <a href=\"https://mediadiversified.org/2016/10/20/the-migrant-led-strikes-of-the-past-can-inform-our-present-and-future/\" title=\"\">Working-class history is migrant history</a>, but we ignore that because it does not match what we believe to be authentic.</p> <p>Likewise any of us who are white and born here, but refuse to blame migrants for the result of government policies, are cast as the \u201cmetropolitan elite\u201d even if we\u2019re earning the same amounts and living in the same towns. Working-class identity becomes necessarily and by definition anti-migrant.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re not the only people with concerns. It\u2019s just that everyone else seems to have them on our behalf</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Once everyone who doesn\u2019t fit is excluded, those who remain are transformed from real people into weaponised stereotypes to be turned against those who resist the advance of jam-obsessed fascism. Even the complexity within people is stripped out as individuals are merged into a howling mass whom you must \u201cunderstand\u201d or risk losing your tolerant, liberal credentials.</p> <p>We\u2019re not the only people with concerns. It\u2019s just that everyone else seems to have them on our behalf, out of the charity of their hearts. The white middle classes are just as likely to be disturbed by brown faces or foreign accents as the white working classes are, but they are generally educated enough to realise they can\u2019t just come out and say it. Working-class poverty, framed as the result of the strains these new arrivals place on our generous social safety net, provides the cover for them to object to immigration even though they are unharmed by it.</p> <p>But our other \u201cgenuine concerns\u201d \u2013 such as school and hospital funding, benefits and disability payments, the crushing of industries that formed the backbones of our local economies \u2013 are ignored or dismissed out of hand. They are cast as luxuries, an irresponsible \u201ctax and spend\u201d approach, or they are turned back on us as evidence of our own fecklessness and lack of ambition. When we say \u201cwe need benefits to live because you hollowed out our towns in pursuit of a flawed economic doctrine,\u201d we are castigated for being workshy, and told we only have ourselves to blame. If we alter our complaints to blame foreign people it\u2019s a different story. \u201cI can\u2019t get a council house because they\u2019ve all been sold to private landlords,\u201d gets nothing. \u201cI can\u2019t get a council house because they\u2019ve all gone to bloody Muslims,\u201d gets on the front page of the tabloids.</p> <p>Just as we are given identities as good or bad working-class people based on whether we adequately perform our roles as good little workers or whether we insolently insist on being disabled, unemployed or unionised, so our authenticity as working-class people depends on our use for political ends. Are we salt of the earth yeomen, or skiving thickos milking the system, or drains on the already stretched infrastructure? That all depends: are we kicking out immigrants or privatising a clinic today?</p> <p>If we only matter to politicians when we can be used as to defend old bigotries about hordes of eastern Europeans stealing our women and poisoning our jam, then we don\u2019t matter at all.</p>",
  "<p>The Ballon d\u2019Or is back in France Football\u2019s possession, even though they contrived to elongate the release of this year\u2019s shortlist to such an extent it made Fifa\u2019s ceremonies seem snappy in comparison. At the conclusion of the nine-hour announcement on Monday there was still an air of predictability about it all.</p> <p>Barring the most surprising result in the award\u2019s 60-year history, Cristiano Ronaldo will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/24/ballon-dor-2016-cristiano-ronaldo-griezmann\" title=\"\">named the world\u2019s best player</a> for a fourth time on 9&#xa0;January, with Lionel Messi trailing behind. While there were a couple of notable omissions from the list, which will not be cut to three as in previous years, all of the world\u2019s best attacking players are present.</p> <p>Having retaken sole ownership of the award following six years of sharing with the governing body, the magazine decided to drip-feed batches of five players to its website in alphabetical order hours apart and it was not until the final portion that the sole England player to be included, Leicester City\u2019s Jamie Vardy, was announced.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/24/ballon-dor-2016-cristiano-ronaldo-griezmann\">Who should win the Ballon d'Or 2016?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A total of 30 rather than the squad of 23 used recently were named and the manner in which the nominees were made public also meant the soporific Ronaldo-versus-Messi debate plumbed new depths. Some of Ronaldo\u2019s fans wondered if a conspiracy was afoot because the Real Madrid star had no exclamation mark at the end of a tweet confirming his inclusion while the rest did. On the other hand Messi\u2019s supporters moaned the Portugal captain featured in the first batch because he was filed under C rather than R.</p> <p>Above the inexorable pettiness fastened to this vainglorious contest the dearth of British players among the world\u2019s best was again laid bare. Gareth Bale, after a remarkable year for club and country, has claims alongside Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s Antoine Griezmann to be considered next best after Ronaldo and Messi. But the Wales and Real Madrid attacker is the only other Briton featured aside from Vardy, who was 350-1 with some bookmakers before the announcement. Those odds shortened immediately but it would be quite a shock to see him announced in the top three.</p> <p>There are eight Premier League players on the list but when it comes to the winner, the Messi\u2011Ronaldo duopoly shows no sign of abating. This year Ronaldo is the overwhelming favourite because he won another Champions League and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jul/10/cristiano-ronaldo-tears-portugal-greatest-night\" title=\"\">led Portugal to the European Championship</a>. Significantly for a player who at times has appeared as concerned by personal titles as much as team honours, it would leave him just one behind the Argentina attacker.</p> <p>It is in the battle for third where the real interest resides. Griezmann and Bale are obvious contenders, with Barcelona\u2019s Luis Su\u00e1rez and Neymar, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/20/brazil-germany-rio-2016-mens-football-olympic-final-match-report\" title=\"\">brought such joy to Brazil</a> during the Olympic Games, sure to feature high up when the results are announced.</p> <p>For the sixth time in eight years, the podium will probably belong solely to La&#xa0;Liga. Spain continues to dominate with 13 nominees shared between Real, Bar\u00e7a and Atl\u00e9tico. The figure of eight Premier League players is embellished by two of those arriving in the summer. Would Zlatan Ibrahimovic or Paul Pogba be entitled to a place based on their performances since joining Manchester United? Probably not.</p> <p>Riyad Mahrez\u2019s inclusion is deserved after his role in Leicester\u2019s title win, West Ham United\u2019s Dimitri Payet dazzled for France in the opening days of Euro 2016 and it is not easy to dispute the inclusion of Manchester City\u2019s Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Kevin de&#xa0;Bruyne, both of whom have looked exquisite at different junctures. Nonetheless, they will all be tailed off when the results are announced in January.</p> <p>The last Premier League player to win was Ronaldo in 2008 and for a league so desperate to claim it is the world\u2019s best this annual jamboree makes for grim&#xa0;viewing.</p> <p>Elsewhere on the list there are four goalkeepers but no place for Spain\u2019s and Manchester United\u2019s David de&#xa0;Gea. Instead, France and Tottenham\u2019s Hugo Lloris is joined by Germany\u2019s Manuel Neuer, a finalist in 2014, Italian veteran Gianluigi Buffon and Portugal\u2019s Rui Patr\u00edcio.</p> <p>Perhaps the most baffling outcome is the shortage of defenders. Only the Real pair of Pepe and Sergio Ramos, plus Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s Diego God\u00edn are included, which seems odd considering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jul/11/euro-2016-fairytales-wales-iceland-defence\" title=\"\">the defensive nature</a> of Euro 2016. The Italy and Juventus pair Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini, Barcelona\u2019s Gerard Piqu\u00e9 and Bayern Munich\u2019s J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng all have a right to feel aggrieved.</p> <p>Then again, only two defenders have ever won this award \u2013 Fabio Cannavaro in 2006, after leading Italy to the World Cup, and Franz Beckenbauer in 1972 and 1976. Even before Fifa\u2019s brief rebranding, this was a contest about more than just performances on the pitch. It is worth bearing in mind Su\u00e1rez said recently that he would never win the award because it is \u201cmore to do with marketing and press than for achievements on the&#xa0;pitch\u201d.</p> <p>The Uruguayan has a point but at least there has been a change to the voting system. Journalists are again in sole control rather than sharing the burden with national team managers and captains. If nothing else it strips away one layer of politics.</p> <p>Ronaldo and Messi petulantly refused to give each other a vote in previous years, highlighting the level of selfishness among the world\u2019s best. But the latter would need a lot more than one insolent vote to sway the results, for this was Ronaldo\u2019s year.</p>",

  "<p>Not since the communist era has a Polish government faced as much criticism from the west as the one in charge today. It is now exactly a year since Law and Justice (PiS), a socially conservative, Eurosceptic and nationalist party, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/27/poland-law-justice-party-wins-235-seats-can-govern-alone\" title=\"\">swept to power</a>, winning a parliamentary majority with 37.5% of the vote. This followed the triumph of PiS\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/andrzej-duda\" title=\"\">Andrzej Duda</a> in the earlier presidential election, giving the party full control over Poland\u2019s executive arm of government.</p> <p>Since then, the ruling party has come under <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/poland-democracy-failing-pis-law-and-justice-media-rule-of-law/\" title=\"\">heavy fire</a> from <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/rule-no-1-for-polands-new-right-wing-government-ignore-the-critics/2016/02/14/d3e5124a-c9bb-11e5-b9ab-26591104bb19_story.html\" title=\"\">western media</a> and institutions, which have accused it of dismantling democracy with policies designed to limit civil liberties, control media, politicise the civil service and <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-11/polish-government-battles-to-blunt-critical-rule-of-law-report\" title=\"\">neuter judicial independence</a>. In July this year, the European commission issued Warsaw with a three-month ultimatum to address threats to the rule of law or face potential sanctions. PiS reacted scornfully, with party leader Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski calling the <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/polish-leader-commission-criticism-amuses-me-jaroslaw-kaczynski-beyong-eu-treaty-power/\" title=\"\">commission\u2019s ultimatum \u201camusing\u201d</a>.

There are several reasons for this, revealing dynamics observable not only in the wider eastern European region, but further west as well.</p> <p>While PiS is strongly rightwing on social issues, its economic approach can be described as leftist. It emphasises the need to tackle inequality and propagates strong welfare policies. It introduced unconditional monthly cash payments equivalent to \u00a3100 for all parents who have more than one child towards the upkeep of each subsequent child until he or she is 18. So if you have three children, you get \u00a3200 per month and so forth. For parents with one child, the payment is conditional on low income.</p> <p>No previous government ever embarked on such a generous social programme. PiS\u2019s approach puts many Polish leftists in a bind. On the one hand, they deplore the party\u2019s unashamedly xenophobic rhetoric; on the other, they like its economic views, especially in comparison to the main opposition parties, Civic Platform and Nowoczesna, both dominated by folk still enamoured with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek\" title=\"\">Hayek</a>. In effect, some on Poland\u2019s left are not as mobilised against PiS as they could be.</p> <p>While the west may have considered post-communist Poland a model of free-market success, many Poles felt marginalised in a society where successive governments espoused a \u201csink or swim\u201d attitude towards citizens, irrespective of whether it was the left or the right in power. Individual success was emphasised above all. PiS\u2019s more communitarian approach is appealing to many Poles who feel they now have a government interested in more than just macro-economic indicators.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"877a7f5cf416e0a7e6c164c42dcb0473106b7a6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/877a7f5cf416e0a7e6c164c42dcb0473106b7a6f/0_0_2211_2497/885.jpg\" alt=\"A poster of Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski\" width=\"885\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski has been widely criticised in Europe for claiming migrants arriving on the continent could cause \u2018epidemics\u2019.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kacper Pempel/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A second factor in PiS\u2019s continued popularity is that western Europe, where most criticism of the ruling party stems from, is now viewed far more critically than before by many Poles. PiS and its&#xa0;rightwing media allies are successfully&#xa0;portraying it&#xa0;as a den of politically correct madness, where hopelessly naive policies have put Europeans at increased risk of Islamic terrorism and being overrun by migrants.&#xa0;</p> <p>EU elites are portrayed as fanatical multiculturalists and secularists who are furious that a traditionally oriented, non-politically correct government is in control of Poland. Meanwhile, Kaczy\u0144ski insists: \u201cIt is completely untrue that to achieve western levels of development, we have to adopt their social models. That is hogwash.\u201d He insists Poland can achieve western-level economic development while maintaining age-old traditional Polish values and remaining a homogenous white Catholic country. In an age when much of Europe is facing an identity crisis, this message is resonating.</p> <p>A few years ago, no Polish government would have been able to get away with openly defying EU institutions without losing credibility domestically. But western opinion no longer has that kind of influence in Poland, especially among the numerically dominant conservatives. This is one of the most significant mental shifts in contemporary Poland and signals a new era in societal attitudes towards the west, one in which its economic development remains admired, but its cosmopolitan liberal values are largely rejected.</p> <p>PiS also remains popular because while Kaczy\u0144ski is highly controversial and generally disliked, the official faces of the government, Beata Szyd\u0142o, the prime minister, &#xa0;and Duda, the president,&#xa0;are both personable unassuming types who help the party maintain a folksy image. There is currently no leftist party in parliament and the liberal opposition is weak and divided. Moreover, both opposition party leaders, Grzegorz Schetyna of Civic Platform and Ryszard Petru of Nowoczesna, are nauseatingly opportunistic, the kind of politicians who won\u2019t take a public stance on any issue till they\u2019ve seen at least half a dozen opinion polls. People are sick of sly, calculating politicos; these days people value authenticity, even if they disagree with their views. PiS employs crude rhetoric, but comes across as authentic.</p> <p>Barring any major political or economic earthquakes, PiS will likely rule Poland for a while to come, providing momentum to the generally Eurosceptic, illiberal and authoritarian tendencies currently triumphing in eastern Europe. Its success should serve as a warning bell to liberals and leftists in the whole of Europe. A growing number of people are becoming increasingly willing to tolerate authoritarian and xenophobic tendencies from parties that offer them a sense of community and security.</p> <p>Ignoring this reality won\u2019t make it go away. On the contrary, if we don\u2019t respond adequately to this dynamic, we might all soon wake up in a Europe where parties similar to PiS have suddenly become the mainstream.</p>",

  "<p>\u201cMy favourite thing,\u201d Diane Arbus once said, \u201cis to go where I\u2019ve never been.\u201d As Arthur Lubow\u2019s deeply researched, sometimes prurient, new biography of the artist attests, she was not just speaking about her photography. The book is punctuated by revelations about her private life, including the claim, based on her psychoanalyst\u2019s notes, that she had a fitful but prolonged incestuous relationship with her beloved older brother, Howard, up until a few months before her death.</p> <p>References to what Lubow calls Arbus\u2019s \u201cmultivalent\u201d sex life are scattered throughout <em>Diane Arbus: Portrait of a Photographer</em>, somewhat belying the book\u2019s matter-of-fact title. We know from previous biographers \u2013 the scholarly Patricia Bosworth and the psychoanalytical <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/oct/23/arbus-emergency-slow-motion-schultz\" title=\"\">William Todd Schultz</a> \u2013 that Arbus\u2019s transgressive art and life were intertwined to a complex degree: she sometimes had sex with some of the so-called \u201cfreaks\u201d she photographed and once took part in an orgy when shooting a story on swingers. Lubow digs deeper, but without shedding much more light than either of his predecessors on her art or the deep discontentments that fuelled it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Arbus did not view her \u201cfreaks\u201d as freaks, but people who had been somehow elevated by being different</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Born into considerable wealth, Arbus suffered all her life from the guilt of privilege. Her mother, Gertrude, was the heir to the family business, Russeks, a prestigious department store on 5th Avenue that sold furs. While Gertrude was detached to the point of cold, her husband, David Nemerov, was strict to the point of bullying. Both, as Lubow notes, \u201cdoled out approval, not love\u201d. Gertrude\u2019s single defining act of defiance towards her family was to fall for Nemerov while he was working as a window dresser at Russeks. Her daughter followed suit, marrying Allan Arbus, who worked in the company\u2019s advertising department. They married when she was 18 and, soon afterwards, he gave her a camera as a present.</p> <p>After pursuing a short, unhappy career as a fashion photographer in collaboration with her husband, she walked off a <em>Vogue </em>shoot, announcing, \u201cI can\u2019t do it any more. I\u2019m not going to do it any more.\u201d This rebellious incident, which Lubow calls Arbus\u2019s \u201cdecisive moment\u201d, is the starting point for his episodic narrative. It led to another key moment, an apprenticeship with Lisette Model, an older photographer, who later described the young woman who walked into her class for the first time in the late 1950s as looking like \u201cshe was just before or just after a nervous breakdown\u201d. Model instructed her to photograph only what excited her. \u201cI can\u2019t photograph,\u201d Arbus protested in one of many tearfully therapeutic episodes, \u201cbecause what I photograph is evil.\u201d Model replied that she needed to confront her anxiety or give up. \u201cIt was my business as a teacher to get it out.\u201d Model later said: \u201cWhat comes after that I am not responsible for morally.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/jul/12/diane-arbus-rare-unpublished-photos-met-breuer-in-pictures\">The early work of Diane Arbus \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If Arbus\u2019s instinct for the perverse was evident even in her early photographs, Model sharpened her gaze and the Diane Arbus we now know, and continue to be intrigued and disturbed by, emerged. She firmly believed that \u201cthere are things nobody would see if I didn\u2019t photograph them\u201d, but, it is really her way of seeing them \u2013 the tension that exists in her images between the empathetic and the exploitative \u2013 that draws us in and, to a crucial degree, makes us complicit in her transgressive art. She photographed compulsively, searching out sideshow misfits, the mentally deficient and the obsessively exhibitionist, but also people she encountered on the street who caught her eye with their aura of otherness.</p> <p>One such passing subject was the young Colin Wood, immortalised by her in a dramatic portrait entitled <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/2001.474/\" title=\"\"><em>Child With a Toy Grenade in Central Park</em></a>, in which he looks deranged while clutching his tiny replica bomb. Lubow tracked him down and found that he too was complicit in the myth Arbus had created for him: \u201cShe saw in me the frustration, the anger at my surroundings, the kid wanting to explode but can\u2019t because he\u2019s constrained by his background.\u201d You could say that she saw in him her younger self. Except that, in all the other images in the contact sheet, he looks playful and engaged. The deceptive art of photography also allowed her to create images that complied with her neuroses: about life, about childhood, about outsiderness, physical and psychological.</p> <p>Unlike many critics who expressed distaste for her work, Susan Sontag chief among them, Arbus did not view her \u201cfreaks\u201d as freaks, but people who had been somehow elevated by being different. \u201cMost people go through life dreading they\u2019ll have a traumatic experience,\u201d she once remarked. \u201cFreaks were born with their trauma. They\u2019ve already passed their test in life. They\u2019re aristocrats.\u201d Her need to photograph them, and sometimes to sleep with them, speaks of a deeper desire to remake herself and to be accepted as a self-styled outsider by people who, from birth, did not have that choice. In her photographs, though, they remain to an unavoidable degree objects of our fascination, their otherness accentuated by flash, stark contrast and dramatic composition. They are also, despite or because of that, some of the most powerful photographic portraits ever made.</p> <p>It was the New Documents exhibition at New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art in 1967 that propelled Arbus into the public eye. Given a room of their own, her images ignited a media frenzy. Oddly, Lubow does not mention one of the most memorably telling details in Bosworth\u2019s biography, namely that, at the end of every day, gallery staff had to clean the glass covering the photographs because members of the public had spat on them.</p> <p>Four years later, on 26 July 1971, Diane Arbus took her own life by swallowing barbiturates and cutting her wrists with a razor blade. She was 48 and had perhaps exhausted her appetite for the strange and the sordid. Depression had stalked her throughout her life, draining her of confidence and creativity, so it may have been that she had also grown fatigued with herself and her neurotic demons. What emerges most forcefully from Lubov\u2019s long portrait is not just the all-consuming nature of Diane Arbus\u2019s dark creative vision, but what it cost to obsessively pursue and yet be so dissatisfied by its relentless demands.</p> <p><em>Diane Arbus: Portrait of a Photographer is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a335). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/diane-arbus-464699.html\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a328.70</em></a></p>",

Contracted to collect and remove materials from refurbishment or \u201cstrip out\u201d projects, it falls to them to dispose of this waste as they see fit. The most forward-thinking firms push clients to segregate waste on site, before its sold to recycling firms.</p> <p>MCS <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/environment/recycling\" rel=\"nofollow\">Recycling</a>, a family-owned waste management firm based in Chatham, Kent, is rare in sending nothing to landfill. To maximise the value of the office waste it collects, the firm endeavours to find bespoke buyers in addition to recycling wholesalers. It recently advertised a skip-full of maple flooring on eBay; the waste ended up with a nearby flooring manufacturer.</p> <p>Not all sales require such networking. MCS Recycling works closely with Armstrong Ceiling Solutions, a manufacturer of suspended ceiling tiles. Since 2009, Armstrong has developed a policy of actively seeking out discarded tiles from refurb projects. It then transports them to its manufacturing facility in Newcastle, where the materials are incorporated into its production process. Last year, Armstrong diverted 495 tonnes of unwanted ceiling tiles from landfill, saving almost \u00a3100,000 in landfill taxes.</p> <p>\u201cIt works out about cost neutral because of the transport and logistics costs, but the use of recycled content in our tiles is definitely a selling point for us.

Paradoxically, however, sex is rarely explained and almost never taught. Do you know how our sexual organs changed when we evolved from animal to human? When did the first couple show up? Where does our sense of modesty come from? Or eroticism? Or love, that most momentous of human concerns? What about our earliest customs? Which ancient civilisation championed equality between men and&#xa0;women? And why was masturbation&#xa0;frowned upon?</p> <p>Sex is one of those realities that for a&#xa0;long time we neither wanted to see nor&#xa0;hear about. The sexual liberation of&#xa0;the 1970s \u2013 which was, in my opinion, the biggest social revolution in the history of humanity \u2013 signalled the&#xa0;transition from a traditional male-dominated society to one in which sex with all its nuances could finally be examined openly and understood. But as sex has dared to uncover itself, to live, to speak, we face the challenge of expressing what for so long has been kept under wraps. How are we to communicate what so recently caused so much shock and outrage?</p> <p>In the west, the union of two individuals is in complete flux, with a drop in those getting married (in France <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/21/france-population-europe-fertility-rate\" title=\"\">57% of births</a> now happen <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Marriage_and_birth_statistics_-_new_ways_of_living_together_in_the_EU#Births\" title=\"\">outside marriage</a>); same-sex marriage; and the option of \u201cslices of life\u201d, relationships with different partners in the course of a lifetime. But however free our customs may be, censorship persists when it comes to the communication of sex, the words, the particular way of defining sexuality and the idea of sensuality. Literature and fiction have always attempted to push the boundaries of this censorship: in the 18th century we had Pierre Choderlos de Laclos\u2019s Dangerous Liaisons; and in the 21st, EL James\u2019s Fifty Shades of Grey. But mostly our discussions fall somewhere between sincerity and provocation as we attempt to understand intimacy and the fullest expression of sexual pleasure.</p> <p>No history book will delve too deeply into the sexual realm, yet it\u2019s clear that history is a timeline of instructions and condemnations about sexuality. Each culture, each religion, each era has defined its own normality.</p> <p>But without learning the history of love and intimacy, how can we understand the extraordinary evolution in customs that has led us from an existence ordered by family and society, and reinforced by religion, to the freedoms we know today? In his collection of aphorisms, Monogamy, the psychoanalyst <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/02/opinion/how-much-does-monogamy-tell-us.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">Adam Phillips</a> says that \u201cmost people would not live as a couple if they had never heard of it\u201d. In this, he is reflecting the artificial nature of our customs and the need for a way to express our thoughts on sex, intimacy and being with other people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/13/porn-sex-erotica-erotic-writing\">Put down the porn and explore real sex with erotica | Mariella Frostrup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We know today that human sexuality is not innate: it is learned and constructed through the images that society offers us. Even among our cousins, the primates, who live in a natural habitat, sexuality is learned through experience \u2013 young monkeys witness the courting and frolicking of the adults. The need for a model is evident: a young chimpanzee isolated from its peers is incapable of mating when it reaches adulthood.</p> <p>Yet there is a fundamental difference: we invented modesty. Humans always make love away from the group.

In France, <a href=\"http://womensenews.org/2015/03/french-official-says-sex-education-falling-short/\" title=\"\">a 2001 law</a> stipulates three classes of sex education a year in middle and secondary school. However, as teachers have no training in this very particular field, it is often organisations such as those devoted to family planning that ensure these classes go ahead. In most cases, they rarely take place at all, and when they do they are limited to the three Ps: \u201cprevention, pill,&#xa0;protection\u201d, in other words, information on fertility and STDs. In this&#xa0;educational void the internet and porn offer themselves as models.</p> <p>This is quite evidently the worst possible model, and the reason why a more reliable source of knowledge is indispensable, from primary school through to the last year of secondary.

We must banish negative terms (sin, adultery, prostitution, Aids and STDs) in favour of positive schooling that allows children to understand desire, pleasure and excitement; the importance of sensitivity in love; the importance of masturbation, even. We must understand that everything can be taught, even the practicalities of how people live together, and&#xa0;we should start in primary school with discussions not only of genital differences but about the variations between boys and girls, the significance of love and of respect that may help with later relationships, notions of gender equality and domestic violence.</p> <p>Only by speaking frankly, lightheartedly and wide-rangingly about sex,&#xa0;love and intimacy can we provide&#xa0;an education that enables adolescents, both boys and girls, to begin their lives&#xa0;with a better understanding of human relationships.</p>",

At times I would get piece jobs so we could eat.\u201d </p> <p>Eventually, this woman\u2019s husband became unable to breathe. He died before he could even get in a car to go to hospital.</p> <p>These conditions are the predictable outcome of deliberate mining policies.</p> <p>Starting in the 1880s, when gold was first discovered, gold mining houses colluded with British colonial governments to put in place a range of taxes and legislation that forced black men to leave their land to work in the mines.</p> <p>Once there, these men were forced to do dangerous jobs. Their work exposed them to malnutrition, tuberculosis and dangerous levels of silica dust. Many developed silicosis, which scars the lungs, makes breathing difficult, increases vulnerability to tuberculosis and can ultimately cause asphyxiation. </p> <p>Black women, on the other hand, were required to remain in rural areas, where they carried out the work of raising workers and, often, caring for them when they later returned home desperately ill.</p> <p>This exploitation remained entrenched for most of the 20th century. The mining industry corrupted the medical examination boards ostensibly in charge of mineworkers\u2019 health. The boards then underreported cases of silicosis, decreasing workers\u2019 eligibility for compensation. Together with the apartheid government, the industry set up a distinct and difficult to use compensation scheme. One study by Deloitte found that less than 1.5% of claims had been paid out to eligible miners.</p> <p>The consequences of this arrangement were predictable. A 2009 report revealed that almost all miners interviewed in the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Transkei\">former republic of Transkei</a>, the largest provider of mining labour, had symptoms of respiratory illness. None were formally employed.

Children on free school meals do not have to pay, but parents who are applying for them are told they still have to pay up front, with the money repaid if their application succeeds. Parents are advised they could put weekly child benefit towards paying for the meals.</p> <p>The email came our way after it was mistakenly sent to Dionne Kelly, the mother at the centre of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/09/uk-property-startup-department-for-education\" title=\"\">original \u201clunch isolation\u201d row, in June</a>, who took her child out of Michaela at the time.</p> <p>Many schools allow parents to pay weekly or daily and, as the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2c3Wqz3\" title=\"\">government indicated</a> last month, there are many families who are only \u201cjust about managing\u201d but are not entitled to free meals.</p> <p>Birbalsingh says the school does support parents who are struggling. \u201cUnlike most schools, Michaela ensures that every child receives a healthy lunch.

This is not unusual and several months\u2019 notice is given in order to help with budgeting.\u201d She adds that pupils are put in lunch isolation only if their parents were able to pay but had chosen not to, and that isolation was not a penalty but \u201cfun\u201d.</p> <p>Back to Smith\u2019s blog, where he curiously writes of himself as the \u201cmiserable old scrote in the corner sucking on his Werther\u2019s\u201d and warns that some will lambast as \u201chyperbollocks\u201d the material Michaela has \u201cspewed out into cyberspace\u201d.

  "<p>The Kenyan Ministry of Transport has announced that it is moving forward with its plans to build a standard gauge railway (SGR), linking Nairobi with the port city of Mombasa, that will cut through <a href=\"http://www.kws.go.ke/parks/nairobi-national-park\">Nairobi National Park</a>. </p> <p>Nairobi is one of the world\u2019s fastest growing cities. It is also unique in encompassing, within its precincts, a major national park that supports lions, rhinos, and other large wild animals. Despite its modest size, the biological diversity of Nairobi National Park is greater than that of some entire countries. It is also a sanctuary of global significance for some endangered species, notably the black rhinoceros. </p> <p>These wonders lie within easy reach of millions of Nairobi residents, as well as tourists and business visitors from all over the world. The co-existence, side by side, of bustling metropolis and natural wildlife paradise sets Nairobi apart from every other capital city on earth.</p> <p>The proposal to construct a railway through the park has led to a major conflict between conservation and development interests, and a heightened level of public concern about environmental compliance in the implementation of large-scale development projects. It has also divided the conservation community in Kenya. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff3a84e8d2bee0d391ad636c8908fa28c2cf09cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff3a84e8d2bee0d391ad636c8908fa28c2cf09cb/0_17_4793_2876/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Environmental and wildlife campaigners protest against plans to build a railway through Nairobi National Park.

Nairobi, Kenya Monday, 17 October 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Curtis/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most Kenyan conservationists are resolutely opposed to the proposal. However, one our most famous and respected colleagues, Richard Leakey, has been at the forefront in supporting the proposed project. In my many conversations with him, it is clear that he is convinced that, like it or not, Kenya will continue to develop and therefore change is inevitable, especially in one of Africa\u2019s fastest growing cities. <br></p> <p>He thinks that the only way to save the park is to raise the railway on pillars like a viaduct 18 m above the park. He is convinced that this will not harm the wildlife, but may in fact become recognized as a wonder of technology, like the Forth Railway Bridge in Scotland, Cikurutug Bridge in Indonesia which soars above a rainforest, and the Landwasser Viaduct in Switzerland to name a few. <br></p> <p>Richard Leakey believes Africa should not be afraid to aspire to greatness in construction, but most of all, he is so confident that it will work in Nairobi Park that he believes it will be a model for other African countries facing similar challenges, such as the Tanzanian plan to put a road across the Serengeti.</p> <p>The Government of Kenya\u2019s argument in favour of the route through the park is more straightforward: it is the cheapest and, technically, the easiest option available. But most conservationists in Kenya, and many people around the world, would say that it is madness to take a decision like this based purely on economic and technical criteria. <br></p> <p>New Yorkers would never fill their Central Park with more office buildings, even though they would generate tremendous profit. Central Park is the soul-restoring asset of New York City. Like Central Park, Nairobi National Park is irreplaceable. But it is quintessentially Kenyan, and immeasurably grander and greater than anything in New York City. </p> <p>Surely, this argument goes, the park is a priceless asset. No amount of money can buy the feeling of awe and wonder at meeting 4-metre tall giraffes for the first time, or the sound of the galloping hooves of thousands of zebras. No economic benefits are sufficient to compensate for the loss of the peace and tranquillity, the feeling of being at one with nature that the park provides.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ba8657fbe35e0a3a6c6881ef32b9a05fd764c90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ba8657fbe35e0a3a6c6881ef32b9a05fd764c90/0_174_5230_3138/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A group of female impala stand in grass made long and lush by seasonal rains in Nairobi National Park, Kenya, 17 May 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A group of female impala stand in grass made long and lush by seasonal rains in Nairobi National Park, Kenya, 17 May 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GRAYLING KENYA PHOTO / STUART PRICE/MEAACT Kenya</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A further concern of environmental experts is that, if the railway crosses Nairobi Park, it will set a very dangerous precedent. National parks in Kenya face multiple threats, including from poaching, illegal grazing, mining, and unregulated urban and agricultural expansion. At root, all these threats arise from conflicts\u2014real or perceived\u2014between economic and environmental conservation goals. <br></p> <p>By allowing economic interests to trump environmental ones in this case, the government and Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) will lose the moral authority to protect other parks facing comparable threats. This will damage Kenya\u2019s reputation and, potentially, roll back decades of conservation successes. </p> <p>I appreciate all these arguments. To understand them better, I have spoken to engineers, land owners, communities, children, politicians, wildlife managers, and conservationists. I have visited the site of the massive new railway terminal under construction in Nairobi. <br></p> <p>I have been criticized by conservationists for considering all options and discussing the matter with the railway engineers themselves. But I needed to do this in order to understand the different issues and develop my own position.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d3c05eeff6734f2a4710f6633d4904bc0005e13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d3c05eeff6734f2a4710f6633d4904bc0005e13/0_199_5293_3176/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Giraffe grazing in Nairobi National Park, Kenya, with the city skyline in the background on 17 May 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giraffe grazing in Nairobi National Park, Kenya, with the city skyline in the background on 17 May 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GRAYLING KENYA PHOTO / STUART PRICE/MEAACT Kenya</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have come to two conclusions. Firstly, we should apply the precautionary principle. Richard Leakey and Kenya Railways have assured President Kenyatta that the railway will not damage the park or the wildlife, a view he has repeated in speeches. They may be right, but hundreds of experts think otherwise, and we will not know who is right until it is done. In my view this is simply too risky an experiment for us to test.</p> <p>But secondly, I recognize that I have no right to expect that my opinion will prevail. There is a need for dialogue. By bringing as many people involved together to discuss the proposal, we may be able to mitigate some of the negative effects and reduce the uncertainty regarding its consequences. It could give democratic legitimacy\u2014that is currently sorely lacking\u2014to the final decision that is taken. <br></p> <p>Last but not least, it will provide the opportunity to initiate an ongoing national conversation around the wider issues raised by this case\u2014issues that go to the heart of our vision for the future of Kenya and the African continent.</p> <p>Like many people in this largely Catholic country, I have been inspired by the wisdom of Pope Francis in his Encyclical on Nature, where he urgently appeals for a new dialogue about how we are shaping the future of our planet: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We need a conversation which includes everyone, since the environmental challenge we are undergoing, and its human roots, concern and affect us all \u2026 Regrettably, many efforts to seek concrete solutions to the environmental crisis have proved ineffective, not only because of powerful opposition but also because of a more general lack of interest. Obstructionist attitudes, even on the part of believers, can range from denial of the problem to indifference, nonchalant resignation or blind confidence in technical solutions. We require a new and universal solidarity \u2026 All of us can cooperate as instruments of God for the care of creation, each according to his or her own culture, experience, involvements and talents. </p> </blockquote> <p>When I first mooted the idea of a dialogue a few weeks ago, I had no idea what the response would be. I have been heartened by the widespread and generous support the idea has received. This has enabled my organization WidlifeDirect, together with other conservation organizations, Kenya Railways, KWS and three research institutions to convene a meeting between government and other stakeholders that will take placin Nairobi on 27th October. </p> <p>Even though the Phase 2 of the railway was formally launched last week, our hope is that there is still time to achieve a negotiated consensus on the best outcome for conservation and development. If successful, this dialogue will not only help secure the future of Nairobi National Park. It can also be the start of a process, building bridges between politicians, planners, engineers and the conservationists to improve decision making for future development projects. <br></p>",
  "<p>Justine Greening, the education secretary, looks set to be defined by the debate on grammar schools: four months into her job and it\u2019s difficult to point to any other significant announcement or new idea.</p> <p>The debate is a shorthand for all the inequalities and divisions that have plagued our education system for ever.

This could appear a far more attractive proposition to parents and the public and win greater support.

Its premise is that strong schools should support struggling schools and teachers learn from each other. But it distorts this to argue that selective schools are the great strength in the system and are uniquely equipped to improve some of the country\u2019s most challenging schools. Selective schools\u2019 new role will be to recruit more children from poor backgrounds, take over struggling schools and open non-selective schools from scratch. And independent schools will have to sponsor an academy or set up a free school to keep their charitable status.</p> <p>Many selective schools do well by the children they choose, and of course they should contribute to education beyond their own doors. But does their success with bright, motivated young people from supportive home backgrounds give them the skills and experience to turn round schools with large numbers of struggling and disaffected children? That is where the challenge lies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/11/jeremy-corbyn-nuclear-11plus-grammar-schools\">Jeremy Corbyn wants to abolish nuclear weapons \u2013 but not the 11-plus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ministers talk about trying to ensure that grammar schools help bright children from poor families \u2013 perhaps by forcing the schools to reserve them a place or by lowering the pass rate.

Ministers should recognise and applaud comprehensives for being the 21st-century engines of social mobility and our best hope of further progress.

  "<p>In the summer of 2005, Jeffrey Karp, a bioengineer at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital (BWH) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was working late one night when he spotted a journal article on a colleague\u2019s desk. What caught his eye was not the text itself, but the full-page colour illustration of Spider-Man that accompanied it. Intrigued, Karp sat down and started reading.</p> <p>The article detailed how a group of researchers had created a new synthetic material by mimicking the properties of gecko feet \u2013 whose tiny, hair-like pillars allow the lizard to stick to and detach from apparently sheer surfaces with ease. Imagined uses for the material included gloves that would allow military personnel to climb up the sides of buildings, just like Spider-Man.</p> <p>\u201cThe wheels in my head started turning,\u201d Karp told me recently. His first thought was to use the material to create a new type of medical tape that could replace sutures and staples, which can damage sensitive tissue surrounding wounds. Karp was working alongside the world-renowned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/17/robert-langer-nanotechnology-pioneer-willy-wonka-revolutionising-medicine\">bioengineer Robert Langer</a> at the time, studying ways to create biodegradable materials that could seal wounds inside the human body. The tape could even go a step further than sutures or surgical staples, he thought, and be used in particularly intricate surgical procedures \u2013 for instance, tying together the small intestine during gastric bypass surgery.</p> <p>The next morning, Karp stopped by Langer\u2019s office and convinced him that he had come up with the perfect idea to win a prestigious research grant. But as he began his research, Karp found that it wasn\u2019t enough to simply rely on friction between the hair-like pillars to make the tape stick. That may be how geckos\u2019 feet work, but he was going to need something much stronger if he hoped to bind human tissue inside the body.</p> <p>When he tried coating the surface of the tape with a glue, Karp found that it seeped in between the pillars, like honey drizzled on to a hair brush. Next, he played around with the position of the pillars on the surface of the tape, placing them closer together. That didn\u2019t work either \u2013 when the pillars were too close together, there wasn\u2019t enough friction with the surface of the tissue. So he moved them apart again, and then tried coating each individual pillar with the glue, instead of simply brushing it over the top. Now, whenever the tissue came into contact with a pillar, it stuck in place. Finally, Karp had his solution.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a great example of a holistic approach to problem-solving,\u201d David Kaplan, chair of the biomedical engineering department at Tufts University in Massachusetts, told me. In 2008, MIT\u2019s Technology Review magazine named <a href=\"http://hsci.harvard.edu/people/jeffrey-karp-phd\">Karp one of the top innovators in the world</a> under the age of 35.</p> <p>Karp, who is now 40 and runs his own lab at BWH, is what is known in the business as a bioinspirationalist \u2013 a person who looks to nature for solutions to scientific problems. The gecko tape was Karp\u2019s first bioinspired invention; these days he is regarded as a leading figure in the field. (He often tells people that he owes his success to Spider-Man \u2013 there\u2019s a large drawing of the Marvel superhero in his office, and he once wore a Spider-Man T-shirt during a TEDMed talk.) Karp\u2019s current projects include surgical staples inspired by porcupine quills, which create smaller punctures in the skin and prevent bacteria from entering wounds, and a new kind of surgical glue inspired by the sticky secretions of marine worms, which is strong enough to bind moving tissue inside major organs, such as the heart.</p> <p>This last invention has helped to cement Karp\u2019s reputation as a rising star in the world of bioengineering. Because he doesn\u2019t just invent cool stuff \u2013 he turns his creations into actual products. \u201cWhen we look to solve problems, it\u2019s not so we can publish papers and get pats on the back from the academic community,\u201d said Nick Sherman, a research technician at Karp Lab. \u201cIt\u2019s more like, \u2018Is this work going to help patients? If not, how do we make it help them?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year, Karp\u2019s surgical glue began a human clinical trial in Paris. It is the first of Karp\u2019s innovations to advance this far. Unlike other surgical glues on the market, his actively repels blood, making it ideal for sealing holes in blood vessels, intestinal tissue, even bone. It is also much sturdier, meaning that surgeons could use it to fix cardiac defects without the need for open heart surgery. \u201cThis could completely transform how we perform surgery,\u201d said Jean-Marc Alsac, the cardiovascular surgeon at the Hospital European Georges-Pompidou in Paris who is overseeing the trial.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Karp Lab, which opened in July 2007, is hidden behind a heavy white door on the third floor of an office building in Cambridge, near Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Inside, a stockpile of white lab coats hangs near the entrance, and beyond lies a jigsaw puzzle of heavy machinery, vials, tubes and jars, sanitising stations and discarded rubber gloves. \u201cLots of labs are doing what appears to be similar work but, truly, they are not in [Karp\u2019s] league,\u201d Arnold Caplan, a professor in the department of biology at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, told me.</p> <p>Every Wednesday at 8am, staff meet in a large conference room to discuss ideas. The lab employs around 25 staff, from undergraduates to postdoctoral fellows, although its ethos is strictly non-hierarchical. One research trainee, Thomas Kuncewicz, joined Karp Lab just over a year ago, before finishing his undergraduate degree, and is now leading two projects. \u201cEveryone\u2019s experience is different \u2013 and that\u2019s what matters most here,\u201d he told me. \u201cNot some dumb pyramid scheme where we have to work our way up through the ranks.\u201d Lab employees are encouraged to email Karp whenever they have a question or idea. \u201cIf you ever email him, within five minutes you\u2019ll have a response,\u201d Kuncewicz said. \u201cIt can be 11pm or 3am, and he\u2019ll reply.\u201d (I have exchanged emails with Karp long past midnight. His average response time is about 10 minutes.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"c5812ff035fefef652414bde6893430370de441d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5812ff035fefef652414bde6893430370de441d/0_103_4300_2580/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeffrey Karp in his MIT lab in Massachusetts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeffrey Karp in his lab at BWH</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Friedman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The lab attracts the kind of budding scientist who won\u2019t turn up their nose at the occasional lab outing to the zoo or the aquarium. A couple of years ago, one of Karp\u2019s students returned from a field trip with a handful of porcupine quills. At the time, Karp was in the middle of designing a new type of surgical staple, which are most often used in surgery to close sensitive wounds that cannot be sutured by hand. Karp looked closely at the quills and noticed that each had multiple tiny barbs on the end of its tip, like a serrated knife. He took a few quills and stuck them in his chin to test how much force would be required to puncture the skin, and how much it would hurt. (\u201cSurprisingly little,\u201d he said later.)</p> <p>Over the next few months, Karp designed a surgical staple with serrated ends, like the quills. He tested it on raw chicken and found it slid in easily, and created small, clean holes that caused virtually no damage to the surrounding tissue. The staples that are currently in use cause large punctures in surrounding tissue \u2013 which allow more bacteria to enter the wound and cause infection. Karp Lab patented the staple and is working on getting it to market. Karp believes that the invention could significantly reduce post-surgery complications, which are often caused by current surgical staples.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Karp took a few porcupine quills and stuck them in his chin to test how much force it would take to puncture the skin</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For Karp and others in his field, nature often holds the key to critical scientific and medical problems. This approach also gives scientists free access to a vast number of solutions that have already benefitted from millions of years of trial-and-error testing. The appeal of bioinspiration, for Karp, lies in the idea that \u201cevery living creature that exists today is here because it tackled a number of challenges. And those that haven\u2019t have quickly become extinct,\u201d he said. \u201cIn essence, we are surrounded by solutions. Evolution is truly the best problem-solver.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA distinct advantage of the bioinspiration route is that pre-existing solutions are somewhat handed to us,\u201d Leif Ristroph, an assistant professor of mathematics at New York University\u2019s Courant Institute, told me. \u201cOf course we have to figure out the mechanisms behind the solution, and determine which parts we care to mimic and which do not carry over to our problem of interest. The leaf as nature\u2019s solar panel is a great example: scientists have been trying to better understand photosynthesis for a long time, even well before we wanted to collect and store solar energy ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>In recent decades, advances in technology, engineering, and robotics have made it easier to observe nature and borrow from it with more precision than ever before. In the early 2000s, Japan Railways Group, which operates the Shinkansen bullet train, asked one of its engineers, Eiji Nakatsu, to come up with a way to fix a longstanding problem. Whenever the train went through a narrow tunnel at high speed, the atmospheric pressure created low-frequency waves that spread out from the tunnel and created vibrations in the air. These vibrations were so powerful that residents 400 metres away from the railway line wrote in to complain about the noise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"370ac867a69c77b4218b41c1e2c284b3ae15827b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/370ac867a69c77b4218b41c1e2c284b3ae15827b/0_514_3126_4194/745.jpg\" alt=\"Karp has developed a new type of surgical staple inspired by porcupine quills.\" width=\"745\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karp has developed a new type of surgical staple inspired by porcupine quills.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Humpata/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nakatsu, who is a keen birdwatcher, wondered if his weekend hobby might provide him with ideas for how to deal with sudden changes in air resistance. His mind turned to the kingfisher, a bird whose long and flat beak allows it to dive from the air (low resistance) into water (high resistance), with a minimal amount of disturbance so as not to alert its prey. Nakatsu redesigned the nose of the Shinkansen 500-Series, making it longer and flatter. The new design successfully reduced air pressure by 30%.</p> <p>The story of Nakatsu and the Shinkansen is a favourite among advocates of bioinspiration. Many of the world\u2019s top academic institutions \u2013 Harvard, Oxford, Stanford, and Columbia \u2013 now offer courses in bioinspired engineering, while organisations such as the World Biomimetic Foundation and the Biomimicry Institute have been established specifically to help spread the word by highlighting the work of companies who dabble in bioinspired design \u2013 an electricity-free ventilation system modelled on termite mounds, for instance, or wind turbines with aerodynamic bumps similar to those found on a humpback whale\u2019s flippers.</p> <p>Still, even those who believe that bioinspiration may hold the key to solving humanity\u2019s most urgent problems \u2013 water scarcity, overpopulation, climate change \u2013 are careful to point out that the field is still in its infancy. Beth Rattner, the executive director of the Biomimicry Institute, told me: \u201cWe can observe and make mathematical replications of a kingfisher beak on the nose of a train, but we\u2019re still unable to fully emulate or replicate a lot of biological phenomena, either at all or to the point where it\u2019s commercially viable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBiomimicry should be considered as a means to understand nature and conceive engineering design, but not as a dogma,\u201d says Maurizio Porfiri, a professor at New York University\u2019s Tandon School of Engineering. In other words, while evolution has pursued an optimal path \u2013 from swimming to flight \u2013 this happened in a specific context, with specific constraints. Even Leif Ristroph concedes that he would not, for example, \u201cslavishly copy a bird or insect\u201d in order to design a robot. \u201cClearly, birds inspired the basic design of aeroplanes, but the early designs with flapping wings did not win out,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Still, Karp is not suggesting that scientists copy nature directly. Instead, he wants to look at what works and improve on it. \u201cThe key is to analyse the solution evolution has converged on, and then take advantage of those principles in an engineering context,\u201d Adrian Thomas, professor of biomechanics in the zoology department at Oxford University told me. \u201cThe obvious mistake is to copy nature \u2013 it is possible to do much better than nature by exploiting the best engineering materials.\u201d</p> <p>While research labs dedicated entirely to bioinspiration are rare, Karp\u2019s is not the only one. Don Ingber\u2019s Wyss Institute at Harvard University, which has been running since 2009, is a bioinspiration factory. There are some 375 full-time staff, who together enjoy more than $600m in grants and philanthropic funding. The lab has co-founded 15 startups in the last three years, and has more than 15,000 patents out for a range of bioinspired technology and designs across a range of disciplines, from medicine to robotics. They include a self-organising swarm of tiny robots that can be used for tasks such as surveillance, traffic monitoring and crop pollination, and a mattress that senses the cardio-respiratory functions of infants and can help detect when they are having trouble breathing. \u201cJeff has done amazing stuff in his lab,\u201d Ingber told me. \u201cBut we can do it much faster. We\u2019re able to take much bigger risks here, and we\u2019re more likely to succeed, both technically and commercially.\u201d</p> <p>But sheer volume is not Karp\u2019s aim. When the lab first opened, Karp thought he might use bioinspiration to tackle problems around cell migration, the process whereby cells move around an organism to aid in tissue formation, wound healing and immune response. That same year, after speaking at a biomedical conference to drum up support for the lab, someone approached Karp and told him bluntly that the only interesting thing about his talk was the gecko tape. \u201cThat\u2019s all people asked me about,\u201d Karp told me. \u201cSo that got me thinking, maybe I should just focus on medical devices. It seemed to be the thing that got people excited.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>One evening in August 2009, Karp received an email from Pedro J del Nido, a specialist in cardiac surgery at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. Del Nido was having difficulty sealing holes in the hearts of young patients suffering from congenital heart defects. Whenever Del Nido tried to suture a hole, the surrounding tissue would tear. He had read Karp\u2019s paper on the gecko tape, and wondered if Karp could help him design something similar to help treat his young patients.</p> <p>This presented a new challenge for Karp. While the gecko tape can seal things like tissue and gastrointestinal tracts, the heart is not stationary. It moves very fast and violently, as blood constantly gushes in and out. Any adhesive would have to be strong enough to resist being washed away in the deluge. Karp wondered if a surgical glue might help solve Del Nido\u2019s problem. Gluing internal surgical wounds is quicker and sometimes more effective than stitches, particularly around sensitive areas where any rip or tear in the skin will damage surrounding tissue. But Karp did not know any surgical glues that could work successfully in the presence of a lot of blood, and none that are strong enough to actually bind moving tissue. What\u2019s more, surgical glues sometimes have harmful side-effects (such as releasing formaldehyde inside the body) and can take as long as 30 minutes to set. As any surgeon will attest, the less time a patient lies on the operating table with their insides exposed, the better.</p> <p>Karp told Del Nido that he would try to come up with something. Except, he didn\u2019t really know how. The gecko tape had been an academic invention. There had been one animal trial \u2013 on mice. Del Nido needed something practical that he and his surgeons could actually use when operating on children. Karp realised that if he was going to help Del Nido, he had to talk to some people who had experience turning inventions into products. \u201cOne of the reasons most medical devices invented in an academic environment never make it to patients is because they\u2019re so complex and you can\u2019t manufacture them at the right scale, or at the right price,\u201d Karp told me. \u201cThe lab is really just the first step.\u201d</p> <p>Karp decided that he would need to build his own network of contacts: entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, patent attorneys, regulatory body contacts, consultants, and business managers, who would be familiar with his methods and guide him on every step of the process. He spent the next two years meeting with venture capitalists around Boston, attending networking events sponsored by local law firms, consulates and biotech companies. He flew around the country presenting his work to various companies. \u201cI wanted to make it in such a way that as soon I came up with an idea, all I\u2019d have to do is just fire off an email to the right person and that would be it,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fad3c021e8c68605539da6bce6cfb38ae870b773\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fad3c021e8c68605539da6bce6cfb38ae870b773/0_602_2880_3598/800.jpg\" alt=\"Karp looks at some glue inspired by the secrations of marine worms.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karp looks at some glue inspired by the secretions of marine worms.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Friedman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>One morning in late June, I accompanied Karp on a visit to the New England Aquarium in Boston. Scientists have a reputation for being slightly awkward, but Karp is at ease in his own skin. Tall, with a lean build and slight stubble, he peppers lengthy scientific explanations with jokes, usually at his own expense. \u201cStop me if I get too boring,\u201d is something he says often. He is fond of drawing diagrams to explain what he is talking about. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those very rare scientists who can talk to everyone at their level,\u201d Sherman, the Karp Lab research technician, told me. \u201cHow he talks to high-schoolers is different from how he talks to PhD fellows, and that\u2019s different to how he talks to physicians. But it\u2019s always at the same level of excitement.\u201d</p> <p>Karp grew up in Peterborough, a rural county in Ontario in a Frank Gehry-designed house that his parents bought from a local builder. The family moved in when Karp was eight; it was his first time living outside the city. There was a buffalo farm across the road, and a sheep farm next door. There was a creek running through the backyard, and the property backed on to a forest. \u201cI would wake in the middle of the night,\u201d said Karp, \u201cand there would be a pack of wolves on my front lawn \u2013 headed to the sheep farm for a snack!\u201d</p> <p>Karp began taking trips into the woods, looking for snakes. Later, he would mount expeditions to trap frogs and snapping turtles by the creek. He got used to seeing foxes on the driveway at dusk and listened out for the hoots of the great grey owls nesting nearby. \u201cFor a kid with no appreciation of nature, this was a really big turning point for me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like, here was this whole new world I never even knew existed.\u201d</p> <p>Inside the aquarium, Karp led me to a large, fluorescent tank filled with lion\u2019s mane jellyfish, one of the largest species, with a bell-shaped hood that can reach eight feet in diameter and tentacles that can stretch over 100 feet. \u201cThe key thing to remember is that the problem comes first, not the solution,\u201d Karp said, peering inside the tank. \u201cWe don\u2019t sit in front of the jellyfish tank and think, \u2018How can we design a medical device that does what these jellyfish do?\u2019 It\u2019s more like, we have a problem we need to solve, and these floating piles of jelly might be able to help us.\u201d</p> <p>A few years ago, Karp began looking at jellyfish to try and improve the design of a blood analysis device that can detect whether a cancer has metastasised after the removal of a tumour. Devices like this already exist: they resemble a small, rectangular chip roughly the size of a sim card. The blood flows through the top part of the device, while the bottom is lined with antibodies, which attach to any cancerous cells present in the sample. By looking inside the chip under a microscope, it is possible to determine if any cells have been \u201ccaptured\u201d \u2013 and therefore if the blood sample contains cancerous cells.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7d23fac295552dc7122960e97d29f82054d3168a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d23fac295552dc7122960e97d29f82054d3168a/0_0_3467_5200/667.jpg\" alt=\"A Lion\u2019s mane jellyfish.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A lion\u2019s mane jellyfish.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cultura RM Exclusive/Alexander Semenov/Getty Images/Cultura Exclusive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An early problem with these devices was that the blood sample flowed too fast and too far above the antibodies, which meant that even when cancerous cells were present, they were not always detected. Later versions of the device shortened the distance between the top and bottom, but this meant that the blood sample had to be smaller, which in turn meant the results were less accurate. (The bigger the sample size, the more accurate the results.)</p> <p>Karp wanted to know if there was a way to force the cancerous cells to slow down and better attach to the antibodies. So, instead of lining the bottom of the device with antibodies, Karp created synthetic jellyfish-like tentacles made out of DNA. The tentacles, which are roughly one-tenth the width of a human hair, are imbibed with a capturing agent that targets circulating tumour cells, and can extend to \u201cgrab\u201d them. In tests of an early prototype, Karp found that his new design could increase the flow of blood by 10 times, making it far more likely that cancerous cells would be accurately detected.</p> <p>We had moved downstairs to the aquarium\u2019s cafe by the time Karp had finished laying all this out, and when I expressed some confusion about some of the details, Karp grabbed a napkin from a nearby table and retrieved a pen from his bag. It was in the shape of a bright orange crab claw. \u201cWhat?\u201d he said, in reference to my amused expression. \u201cI think it\u2019s funny. I got it from a souvenir shop.\u201d He then proceeded to draw a diagram of his device on the napkin. (Karp\u2019s business card features a very similar drawing of the tentacles, and a picture of jellyfish on the back, to show the process from inspiration to creation.)</p> <p>\u201cNow,\u201d Karp said, leaning in conspiratorially. \u201cYou want to touch a stingray?\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In early 2011, Karp asked one of his graduate students, Maria Pereira, to help find a solution to the challenge that Pedro del Nido had set him: namely, how to seal holes in children\u2019s hearts. \u201cWe tried to define the key criteria for the problem: a material that couldn\u2019t be washed away by blood, was easy to deliver and minimally invasive,\u201d Pereira told me. \u201cSomething that a surgeon could control.\u201d</p> <p>Following Karp\u2019s example, Pereira looked to the natural world for solutions. She held lab meetings and asked everyone to email her ideas or pictures of creatures that live in especially wet environments. People circulated photos of slugs and snails. \u201cWe began thinking, how do snails stay attached to leaves when it\u2019s raining?\u201d Karp told me. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t the trails they leave behind washed away by the rain? What are those secretions made of?\u201d</p> <p>One day, someone emailed Karp and Pereira a link to a research paper on sandcastle worms, which live in shallow water on the Californian coast. The worms secrete a sticky, viscous goo that they use to build underwater shelters by gluing together bits of shells and sand grains. The goo is also hydrophobic \u2013 meaning it repels water \u2013 to ensure the shelter withstands the force of waves.</p> <p>Slowly, Karp and Pereira began to imagine a product that would not only be used to treat small internal wounds in children, but that would have wider applications. They now envisioned a liquid surgical glue, strong enough to work in any major organ. It would be both biodegradable and capable of repelling blood and water.</p> <p>In 2013, Karp co-founded Gecko Biomedical in Paris with the help of Bernard Gilly, the chairman of a group of small French biotech companies. Pereira later moved to Paris to join the company as its head of research.</p> <p>Over the next few years, she and Karp tested different versions of the glue, each with a slight variation in viscosity or adhesive properties. Some versions were too runny and not sticky enough; other prototypes were so sticky they would not spread easily on to tissue. It was not enough to have the glue sit on top of the tissue \u2013 it needed to infiltrate it, in order to create a perfect seal that would prevent air or blood from seeping through. Karp thought about how ivy attaches to the sides of buildings \u2013 the plant\u2019s \u201croot hairs\u201d seek out crevices and cracks, then secrete a glue that spreads the hairs in different directions. The hairs then shrivel up and dry in a spiral shape, which anchors the plant to its location. \u201cMany of the glue formulations did not work, but the ones that did worked very similarly to ivy, because they were able to burrow into the tissue,\u201d Karp said.</p> <p>Karp and Pereira also developed a device in the shape of a pen, which emits a visible LED ray of light that reacts to the glue, so a surgeon can set the glue once it is applied. (The process takes five seconds.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/apr/24/biomimicry-nature-environment-design-engineering-energy-efficiency\">Mushrooms, whales and hurricanes: how bio-inspiration boosts energy efficiency</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Each version of the glue was tested first in animal or human tissue inside the lab, and then inside a living organism, usually a rat or pig. The \u201cright\u201d version presented itself entirely by accident. Karp and Pereira set up an animal trial at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital to test a new iteration of the glue: a small, circular patch rather than a liquid version. They created a hole inside the heart of a living rat, and were just about to seal it with the patch when it slipped off. They put it back on top of the hole, but by that point there was so much blood that the patch would not stay in place long enough for Karp to cure it with the light pen.</p> <p>Scrambling for a solution, Karp asked Pereira to scrounge up as much of the most recent batch of liquid glue as she could. Pereira then spread the glue on to a spatula, and applied it to the leak in the rat\u2019s heart. Karp followed with the light, and the glue set. \u201cIt did exactly what it was supposed to \u2013 it repelled the blood and it remained in place,\u201d Karp said. \u201cWe ended up with a perfect seal. This was a massive hole, so showing that we can seal it without sutures or staples was a big deal to us.\u201d (When Karp and Pereira checked up on the same rat six months later, they found no signs of disability or stress. The glue on the animal\u2019s heart had gradually biodegraded as tissue had grown over the patched up hole.)</p> <p>Last spring, Karp showed off the glue during a talk at Zoobiquity, a semi-regular conference that brings physicians and veterinary surgeons together to swap notes. The event took place at the New England Aquarium, and Karp spoke from a semi-raised platform in front of the penguin pool. After the talk, a dental surgeon named William Rosenblad approached Karp to ask if he would be willing to give him some of the glue to use on one of his canine patients, a bulldog named Little Papi. Rosenblad had carried out three unsuccessful procedures to treat an oronasal fistula, a common problem in dogs and cats that results in a large hole in the mouth leading to the nasal cavity. \u201cHe looked pretty desperate,\u201d Karp said. \u201cHe just said, \u2018Get it to me as fast as you can.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>A week later, Rosenblad sealed the hole in Little Papi\u2019s mouth using Karp\u2019s glue. \u201cI knew the real test would come when everything had healed,\u201d Rosenblad told me. Karp was present at the follow-up appointment two weeks later. Little Papi sat patiently while Rosenblad checked inside his mouth, finally declaring that the glue had worked \u2013 the hole was sealed. \u201cWe all got a bit emotional,\u201d Rosenblad told me. Little Papi\u2019s owner walked up to Karp and shook his hand. \u201cHe kept repeating, \u2018You changed my life,\u2019\u201d Karp said.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In March this year, after successfully raising 22.5m euros, Gecko began a trial of the surgical glue at four hospitals in Paris. The glue was tested on 36 patients, most of whom underwent vascular reconstruction surgery, in which blood vessels are either cut open to remove plaque or enlarged to enable better flow. Jean Marc Alsac, the surgeon overseeing the trial, said that it tested two things: one, how quickly the bleeding stopped when the glue was applied, and two, that there were no adverse effects in patients in the three months after surgery. \u201cIt worked immediately,\u201d Alsac told me. \u201cI wasn\u2019t prepared for the surgery to be over that quickly. It was astonishing.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The glue worked immediately. I wasn\u2019t prepared for the surgery to be over that quickly. It was astonishing</p> <footer> <cite>Jean-Marc Alsac</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A human trial of the glue is planned for next year in the US. Karp hopes the glue will become part of the surgical armamentarium \u2013 available in all hospitals throughout the world \u2013 to reduce surgical times and complications of current procedures. He also wants to see it used in surgeries where there are currently no suitable methods to close tissues, such as in minimally invasive procedures where it is difficult to tie knots in small spaces, or where bulky stapling devices cannot fit. \u201cCurrently, many surgical procedures are much more invasive than they need to be,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut with better ways of sealing tissues in small spaces, this can drastically be reduced.\u201d</p> <p>Making the glue indispensable to surgeons could also help boost bioinspiration\u2019s profile, particularly in medicine. \u201cI think as others see successful examples, they will be more inclined to give it a try,\u201d Karp said. \u201cWhen I first started out, I didn\u2019t really see bioinspiration as a tool or platform \u2013 merely a project. I certainly didn\u2019t realise how powerful it could be.\u201d</p> <p>When I visited Gecko\u2019s headquarters in Paris this summer, I asked Pereira to show me how the glue works. She filled a small syringe with 0.2ml of the glue, which is yellow and gloopy. She took a piece of clear rubber and pressed a small dot of glue on to its surface. \u201cLet\u2019s pretend this is a ruptured vessel inside the body,\u201d she said. She took a thin metal rod and spread the glue around on the rubber surface. She then took the pen light and held it over the rubber for five seconds. \u201cHere,\u201d she said, pushing the rubber into my hands. \u201cFeel it.\u201d</p> <p>The glue had set into a shiny, flexible coating on top of the rubber. I played around with it for a few minutes, then asked Pereira if I could try applying the glue myself. She shook her head, laughing. \u201cYou\u2019ll just have to wait your turn like everyone else.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 October 2016.
