  "<p>Ten years ago, the war in Afghanistan was easy to cover. You left Kabul in the early morning, drove north for an hour to the frontlines that ran across the famous Shomali plains. On one side were the Taliban, on the other troops loyal to the Northern Alliance. </p> <p>You would stop by and visit the local commander, usually sitting with a cup of tea, a rug and a radio, and then, avoiding the mines, walk up through the shattered vines and apple orchards to where the frontline positions lay. A few interviews, five minutes in a bunker if the usually desultory shelling started, and an hour later and you would be back in Kabul.</p> <p>In 2002, the Taliban had been defeated. The frontlines on the Shomali plains had gone. Travelling around the country, I was surprised by the depth of the widespread goodwill towards the western forces. I had feared that Afghans, particularly the Pashtun tribes in the south and east, would resist this latest foreign invasion and that, with much of the country against them, we would see British or US troops stuck in isolated firebases, heavily armed islands in a sea of hostility. </p> <p>Now, six years later, we are fast approaching that scenario. Some things have gone right - the Shomali Plains now boasts de-mined vineyards, rebuilt villages, schools, clinics and roads - but many others have gone wrong. In Kabul, the most honest and the best informed are talking of the need for a radical change in strategy if all that has been achieved is not to be lost. How can this be done? The following are a few ideas culled or condensed from dozens of interviews with senior diplomats, government officials in Kabul last month.</p> <p>Afghanistan should be seen as a country not a conflict. The vast proportion of our effort and focus \u2013 political and journalistic - is military. Relatively minor troop reinforcements receive disproportionate attention. The real problem is the weakness of the Afghan government. This needs to be the key thrust of all policymaking. Counter-insurgency strategies have failed in the 20th century, such as in Algeria or Vietnam because the regimes the troops were trying to support lacked legitimacy. Somehow Afghans need to be given faith in their government.</p> <p>Equally, 25 million Afghans must not be seen as some kind of shapeless mass there to be moulded. Winning hearts and minds does not just mean persuading others that you are right. The state we should be trying to build is the one that is closest to what the Afghans want, not closest to the one that we think they should have. And that state is likely to be considerably more conservative in religious or social terms than we would like. Given general sentiment in the region, it is, paradoxically, likely to be relatively anti-western too. </p> <p>Many interviewees spoke of the need to make armed force \u2013 and in particular air power - a tool of last resort, not the default. The very presence of foreign troops saps the government's legitimacy. They should not be withdrawn \u2013 chaos would follow \u2013 but the blunt instrument of armed force needs to be made sharper. There needs to be one unified command in Afghanistan and one set of rules of engagement for all troops. Training the Afghans should be the priority. Tours of duty must be lengthy so individuals can gain real knowledge and build real relationships, and clearly air strikes that kill civilians must be stopped. Good intelligence comes from patient work with communities, not from paid informers or predator drones. Coalition commanders argue that air strikes save the lives of their soldiers. The politicians reason that this prevents the critical loss of public support for the war at home. In fact, every dead Afghan civilian prolongs the fighting and risks many more western soldiers' lives in the long run. Western voters are prepared for casualties if the war seems winnable and the strategy convincing. But not when they see soldiers dying for a lost cause.</p> <p>The actual nature of the Taliban needs to be recognised too. These are not barmy bearded terrorists, but seasoned and capable fighters who have, so far, fought a coalition of 40 nations with state-of-the-art weapons which outnumbers them in the field by at least two-to-one to a stalemate. Equally it needs to be recognised that the Taliban in part represent a long-standing conservative, reactionary, ethno-nationalist tendency within Afghanistan and that they have gained ground as much by establishing a parallel administration in the area they control as much as by the gun. They are not simply terrorists. It would be much easier to counter them if they were.</p> <p>Attention devoted to Afghanistan must no longer be intermittent either. The incoming US president needs to appoint a powerful figure with special responsibility just for Afghanistan with a large staff and regular access to the Oval Office. As Afghanistan is clearly a regional problem \u2013 there can be no peace there until there is peace in Pakistan too \u2013 a series of major conferences bringing together regional powers are also necessary. </p> <p>These need input too not only from the EU and the US but also China and Russia. Nations that profess themselves leaders of the Islamic world such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt or key western interlocutors such as Jordan and Turkey must be convinced to engage more fully in Afghanistan. They can provide much needed legitimacy, diplomatic capital and advice. Iran will also have to be included.</p> <p>The wish list could continue \u2013 arrests of major drug dealers, protection for honest judges, more development cash channelled through the Afghan government rather than through foreign agencies, an expansion of successful community-based development and local government programmes, a powerful central council bringing Afghans and the international community together, economic initiatives to bring India and Pakistan closer together etc etc.</p> <p>How much of this is likely? Not much, to be honest, which leaves three scenarios. The bleakest outlook is that there will be no change. The Taliban gets still stronger, the west gets tired and pulls out and, as regional powers meddle more, we are back to the violent chaos of the 1990s. </p> <p>The brightest is that recent reverses turn out to be a temporary setback. The recent Taliban advances are rolled back and as temporarily halted development kicks in again district after district drops into government administrative hands. Before we know it the insurgents are nothing more than a nuisance in the deep south. </p> <p>The third prospect is of a long and gruelling conflict that gradually takes the form of a vicious civil war. Any economic development is restricted to the north, while the south is run by an increasingly entrenched Taliban but for a few points ringed by western troops. There is ongoing violence in Pakistan, some haphazard elections, a new conservatism in Kabul that draws some of the insurgents sting but not enough and a gradual draw-down of international troops - once a form of victory can be convincingly declared leaving a fragile state running a chaotic, war-wracked country. Not exactly edifying but sadly I think it is the most likely.</p>",
  "<p>Dimitar Berbatov has not had long to impress his team-mates but he announced himself in training yesterday with a moment that demonstrated why Sir Alex Ferguson regards the idea of retirement, and leaving his team of champions to another manager, as a personal affront. It was an instinctive volley, with minimum backlift, spearing a shot into the top corner of Edwin van der Sar's goal and drawing applause from his new colleagues. \"He is a Manchester United-type player,\" Ryan Giggs confirmed. \"For a big man he has a superb touch.\"</p> <p>The real business starts today when Berbatov is thrown into the bearpit that is Anfield whenever Manchester United are in town. How Ferguson plans to accommodate him in the same team as Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez remains to be seen and, in a few weeks, the United manager will also have to devise a way to shoehorn Cristiano Ronaldo into the side as well. But if there is one Ferguson quality that should never be overlooked, it is his bold instinct and sense for the dramatic. </p> <p>\"I don't know how Alex is going to get all these players into the same team but he will,\" says Carlos Queiroz, Ferguson's former assistant and now the Portugal manager. \"Berbatov will play a lot of games this season. I know that. I think Alex will play Ronaldo, Tevez, Rooney and Berbatov all in the same team, I really do. And if this system functions as he hopes it will, it will make Manchester United's the most dangerous attack in all the world.\"</p> <p>It is a prospect that should induce trepidation among all of United's rivals. Last season, Ronaldo, Tevez and Rooney managed 79 goals between them. Ronaldo cannot be expected to score 42 goals again, but Ferguson is already calculating how many goals his quartet of attackers can accumulate this season. \"I have always said Rooney is capable of goals,\" said the United manager. \"Tevez is capable of 20 goals, Dimitar is capable of that, Cristiano is capable of that. If Wayne does it too, add that together and you're talking about a fantastic amount of goals - enough, definitely, to win trophies.\"</p> <p>Ferguson does not always get it right when it comes to strikers and, astonishingly, once said that he had been put off trying to sign Fernando Torres because he did not think the Spaniard was composed enough in front of goal. When it comes to Berbatov, however, it is difficult to fault his belief that the \u00a330.75m signing from Tottenham Hotspur will take the European Cup winners to an even greater level of excellence.</p> <p>\"If you look at our other strikers, they are all very young,\" says Ferguson. \"Carlos is the oldest, but he's only 23. So Dimitar gives us extra experience and composure. His balance and vision are excellent, his goal ratio is very good. He has a physical presence that we have not had for a long time, probably since Teddy Sheringham and Eric Cantona. Plus he's a big-game player too. We're delighted with his acquisition. It's a big, big step for Manchester United.\"</p> <p>As everyone who watched Sky's hysteria-fest will know, the deal was not concluded until five minutes before the midnight cut-off on transfer deadline day, bringing an end to one of the most protracted transfer sagas of the summer. Yet Ferguson's initial interest in Berbatov can be traced a good deal further back, to when he played against United for Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League in 2002. </p> <p>\"Berbatov was always on the list of possible players that we wanted to bring to United,\" says Queiroz. \"He was on it for about five years and, to be honest, he was always pretty much at the top. We were offered him on occasions but always when we had other players in that position. But he was always on our mind and never forgotten. Alex and myself talked about him a lot and Alex would rave about him.\"</p> <p>The comparisons with Cantona are not exactly original but probably inevitable given the way that Berbatov can seem in utter control of the ball and has a brooding side to his personality that led Paul McGrath to use his column in the Birmingham Mail this week to describe him as a \"brat\". Yet Cantona, despite his public image, was very much \"one of the lads\" at Old Trafford and Giggs, for one, has already taken to his new team-mate: \"He has that physique and stature. He is over six feet tall and he offers something a little bit different to Wayne Rooney or Carlos Tevez. But he also has a big personality, the personality you need to be a success at Manchester United.\"</p> <p>Queiroz does not go for the \"new Cantona\" line. \"For me, he's the new Ruud van Nistelrooy. He is a killer in the penalty area. But he is not one of those strikers who is really selfish. He is quick, but there is more to him than that. He is intelligent, a cerebral player. He is a good team player and Alex particularly likes that. He will bring other players into the game. He will occupy defenders and ensure they have to work enormously hard. That will be a huge help to other United players like Rooney and Tevez, who can then come in and exploit those gaps. His signing will make this team even better and, when you consider what they won last year, that makes it a brilliant future for Manchester United.\"</p>",
  "<p>How much suffering will it take before the public develop a soft spot for Chelsea? Most of us can identify with fallibility and the club did go without a trophy last season. To emphasise the fumbling humanity, John Terry mis-hit the penalty that would have won the Champions League final. Yet that was still not enough to make outsiders feel a pang of identification. Perhaps the remaining hope at Stamford Bridge is that Manchester City, given time, will corner the market in hostility.</p> <p>That does feel far-fetched for the moment, despite the takeover by the Abu Dhabi United Group. There simply aren't enough bogeymen at Eastlands. Mark Hughes is an outstanding manager in the making, but he does not have Jose Mourinho's love of mischief. In addition, it will take a while before the impact of the new ownership can be gauged. If City beat Chelsea at home today it will be no more than they achieved in October 2004.</p> <p>So far, the club has made its impression by raising the stakes until Roman Abramovich, Chelsea's owner, withdrew from the bidding for Robinho. From the viewpoint of the proprietors, it made sense to gazump Chelsea by offering Real Madrid \u00a332.5m for the Brazilian. The additional \u00a36m was a small surcharge to pay for convincing the world that they are serious about reaching into their immense financial reserves. Abramovich, however, was making a statement of his own. By an oligarch's standards it was an austere one.</p> <p>The cash flow had been cut to a comparative trickle before, but, in the summer of 2007, that looked like an admonishment of Mourinho. It is different now. Maybe Chelsea could have fended off City and secured Robinho, but their \u00a326m bid was at the extreme end of the attacker's valuation. It might do Chelsea some good in future negotiations to show that they will no longer meet any price.</p> <p>Abramovich has been in control at Stamford Bridge for five years and the club had already been prominent before he came. The team that fought a thrilling and hectic Champions League quarter-final with Barcelona in 2000 had hardly been composed of journeymen.</p> <p>Much as it will make people outside the capital grind their teeth, London itself is an asset to Chelsea. When Patrick Kluivert was one of the most sought-after footballers on earth he was asked if he wanted to play in the Premier League. His answer was that he would like to play in London.</p> <p>Even when geography is irrelevant, people find it hard to abandon their habitual perspective. Dimitar Berbatov, spellbound by Manchester United's status, would not engage with the idea of moving to City, irrespective of whatever fortunes could have been laid before him. The Bulgarian is surely as materialistic as the rest of us, but he was happy to stumble along as the commonplace sort of millionaire.</p> <p>Conversely, Hughes and his employers at Eastlands will have to screen prospective signings meticulously. Footballers who are interested only in money are never worth it. City will be hoping that Robinho's remark about accepting the offer \"Chelsea\" had made him was an understandable slip of the tongue at the end of a confusing day and not an inadvertent confession that he would have preferred Stamford Bridge if greed had not got the better of him.</p> <p>Maybe City do envisage a tidal wave of cash sweeping away all reservations, but extravagant statements by a spokesman for new owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan about the sums City will pay have been curtailed. The Abu Dhabi United Group seem to want to adopt a more measured tone. Even if they do outspend everyone else, a great team will not be established automatically. Indeed, the club had been coming on nicely and outdoing most rivals in their youth development. The owners should listen carefully when Hughes extols the academy. </p> <p>They would be wise, also, to pay attention when the manager speaks of the subtleties of team-building. The executive chairman, Garry Cook, was no doubt correct when noting that \"Richard Dunne doesn't roll off the tongue in Beijing\", but opponents everywhere know exactly who this influential centre-half is.</p> <p>While expensive acquisitions can also have a great effect, City must exercise great judgment even if they have the means to win every auction, and other targets will remain for their rivals. This could be the most interesting period of Abramovich's tenure. If a billionaire ever gets jaded, it may be revitalising to be cast as the most improbable of underdogs.</p> <h2>How they measure up</h2> <p><strong>What Roman Abramovich owns</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 A painting by Francis Bacon called Triptych (1976), which he purchased for $86.3m (\u00a344m) at Sotheby's in New York this year</p> <p>\u00b7 A country estate in West Sussex, which he bought for \u00a312m.

  "<p>Confronted by an event as spectacularly improbable as Theo Walcott's hat-trick against Croatia, there tends to be a mass fumbling for the correct formulation to explain where exactly this all came from. Luckily, post-Walcott, there was something close to a consensus. The Berkshire tyro was described, variously, as \"a teenage whirlwind\", \"a 19-year-old born to sprint\", \"young and untainted\", \"free from it all\", \"acting on instinct\" and - my favourite - \"not paralysed by thinking too much\".</p> <p>The feeling seems to be that he is a force of nature, a noble primitive, raw, untarnished and smelling faintly of peat and bog water. This reading of Walcott has him emerging fully formed from a laurel bush in Berkshire, bright-eyed, shrouded in rural myth, some kind of wood sprite or nymph. You might glimpse him in the tree-line at dusk. He feeds on berries. His nose is wet. He frolics and gambols. He chews bark.</p> <p>This is an uplifting image for everyone concerned, particularly the thought of a partnership between the primitive Walcott and Wayne Rooney, also, in his time, an elemental teenage force of nature. Where Walcott is rustic and galloping, the Everton-era Rooney was squarely in English football's urban foundling tradition. Early reports on the teenage man-cub had him being discovered in a dustbin outside a pub, his bones made of Monster Munch, Fruit Shoot in his veins, exhaust fumes on his breath, a landfill savage with a football wedged in his jaws. </p> <p>When this kind of startlingly youthful talent emerges it does tend to be via the fluke-ridden, diamond-in-the-rough, little-boys-dribbling-tennis-balls-home-from-school route. For example, it has been discovered that Stanley Matthews was created by a freak industrial accident during a malfunction at a Staffordshire bootlace factory. If you look closely at photos you can see that instead of hands Matthews has balls of thickly knotted white string. George Best was spotted by scouts running wild with a pack of Connemara ponies through the discotheques and boutiques of the Ulster hills. Bobby Moore was found repeatedly hoisting an imaginary World Cup beneath a water mains in a 1950s Dagenham housing estate. This is how we do it. </p> <p>For now the scurrying image of Walcott sits well. The only problem is making it last. Noble, frolicking naivety is a fragile quality. It's the little things that might help preserve it. Paring his toenails with a flint to celebrate a goal. Emerging nude from the team bus for today's game at Blackburn. Abandoning all speech in favour of an expression of wounded dignity. </p> <p>The fear is that Walcott will be corrupted. He'll start to wear clothes, to sleep in a bed. Picture him like a 1970s representation of Tarzan, his elemental spirit tainted by things like hair gel, processed ham, pop music and \"this thing you call ... love\". Here he is frothing, howling at the sun, tearing feverishly at his heavy tweeds as he rushes in confusion from the smoking room of a country house shooting party, before fleeing at scintillating speed into the woods to brood in a pile of leaves. </p> <p>Perhaps it would be kindest just to let this noble savage run free. Go, Theo. Run. Just remember, we will need you back for Belarus.</p>",
  "<p>Gone is the time when the standard fictional portrait of a mother was a Dickens-style angel of the hearth; literary mothers these days are more ambiguous characters, tormented by conflicting desires. If the angelic portrait was hopelessly unrealistic, the contemporary version often dwells on the asperities of the state - the long hours with only a toddler for company, the tyranny of plastic, the drone-like chanting of jingles. Rachel Cusk's recent novel Arlington Park focused with relentless dark comedy on a group of mothers who have long abandoned the notion of perfection: they hurl their children irritably into pushchairs; they languish in death-in-life drop-in-centres and shopping malls; they are flawed and half-mad, and yet completely ordinary.</p> <p>The Ten-Year Nap, the latest novel by the excellent Meg Wolitzer, presents four New York mothers emerging from a decade in babyland. Amy, Jill, Roberta and Karen have built a thousand Lego houses; they have stood like omnipotent giants over their earnest offspring; they have commanded and entreated; and finally the Lego lies abandoned and the children are at school, or busy with some enterprise their mothers can hardly understand. Attempts to insert themselves into the newly inscrutable lives of their children prove poignantly unsuccessful. When Amy insists on reading her 10-year-old son a bedtime story, she finds herself adrift in mindless fantasy-speak: \"The Moorchaser, of course, was not a man; he was a Frailkin, and none of this species had ever entered the zone before.\" \"What the hell is a 'Frailkin'?\" Amy wonders to herself.</p> <p>When not pondering such questions, these women are frantically taking stock. What is it that they want? How should they spend their remaining span of years? Amy was formerly a lawyer; her husband still works at the law firm where they met. Roberta was once an artist, and now finds a creative outlet in puppetry for schools. She thinks of all the hours she spent doing \"art projects\" with her own children: \"it had been blissful, it had been worth it, but now she bitterly felt yet again that she should have been out in the world doing art.\"</p> <p>As in Wolitzer's previous novels, The Wife and The Position, the writing vibrates with historical comparisons, each character acutely aware of the contrasting experiences of her own mother. Amy is the daughter of a campaigning feminist; Jill's mother abandoned a fledgling acting career, her promise bartered for a bemusing life in a \"Tudor house down a private road . . . the maid vacuuming discreetly in the living room\". Jill spent years in the world of work before she married, and recalls only boredom and petty disappointments.</p> <p>Both realms are shown to be fraught with compromise and self-suppression. Life muddies idealism, and, Wolitzer suggests, parenthood does so especially. The most determined career woman is suddenly assailed by a deep, dark impulse towards self-annihilation. She stands neck-deep in a sort of primordial slime, ancient biological absolutes that make no allowances for the annual report. Some drag themselves out; others never fully emerge. And then there is the child - fascinating and vital, the species renewing itself. The Ten-Year Nap is a wonderful study of muddy equivocation, a hilarious yet compassionate examination of primordial slime and the modern woman.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Joanna Kavenna's Inglorious is published by Faber.</p>",

  "<p>In the late 1940s, Werner Heisenberg (author of the uncertainty principle) came to Bristol and gave a lecture on particle physics. The most memorable bit was that he thought there could be \"an infinite number of fundamental particles\", and this was at a time when we knew of just a handful of them. If Heisenberg was right, there could be no end to the programme of collision counting and analysis - horrors; for the sake of future students, I am hoping for a more neat and elegant solution.

  "<p><strong>Agamemnon</strong>, by Aeschylus</p> <p>A-level examiners with anxieties about the lessons taught by literature would find their worries here confirmed. The murder of Agamemnon by his wife Clytemnestra, who has taken a lover, begins the great tradition of western tragedy. We hear Agamemnon's cries as he is killed, and then his wife describes it for us: \"Violent driven rain of bitter savoured blood / To make me glad\".</p> <p><strong>Macbeth</strong>, by Shakespeare</p> <p>You don't actually see the murder of Duncan by Macbeth, but you do witness the later subcontracted killing of Banquo by the nameless \"three Murderers\". Most chilling is the scene where they get their instructions from Macbeth, and confess themselves so battered by \"the vile blows and buffets of the world\" that they are willing to do anything terrible.</p> <p><strong>Oliver Twist</strong>, by Charles Dickens</p> <p>Probably the most famous killing in Victorian fiction, the murder of the kindly prostitute Nancy by her erstwhile beau Bill Sikes is both melodramatic and genuinely horrific. Dickens's performance of it was the climax of his famous live show. Female spectators sometimes fainted.</p> <p><strong>The London Merchant</strong>, by George Lillo</p> <p>This 1731 tragedy is hardly known any more, yet created an extraordinary stir throughout the 18th century. Based on an old ballad, it is the story of the apprentice George Barnwell, who, infatuated by a courtesan, murders his wealthy uncle. The uncle forgives him even as he is dying, so George can later go gladly to the scaffold.</p> <p><strong>Crime and Punishment</strong>, by Fyodor Dostoevsky</p> <p>Dostoevsky really puts you through it because he puts his murderer through it. The feckless student Raskolnikov murders an old money-lender (and her sister who comes upon the crime). We spend most of the rest of the novel experiencing his guilt and terror, as justice closes in. </p> <p><strong>\"Porphyria's Lover\"</strong>, by Robert Browning</p> <p>An eloquent dramatic monologue of a psychotic speaker who sits by the fire with his beloved Porphyria. At its end he describes how he has just strangled her with her own beautiful hair so that she will always be his. \"And all night long we have not stirred, / And yet God has not said a word!\"</p> <p><strong>L'\u00c9tranger</strong>, by Albert Camus</p> <p>Meursault, a Frenchman living in Algeria, shoots an Arab on the beach one day. The Arab has been in a fight with Meursault's friend Raymond, a local pimp, but our emotionless narrator tells us that he pulled the trigger because of the irritating heat of the day, rather than out of vengeance. He then fires four more times into his victim's body. Life is, after all, absurd.</p> <p><strong>Lolita</strong>, by Vladimir Nabokov</p> <p>\"You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style,\" observes the narrator Humbert Humbert at the start of the novel. The witty paedophile plans to murder Charlotte, mother of Lolita, but she gets herself run over instead. Later, however, he does ruthlessly slay Quilty, the man who stole Lolita from him. He also manages to turn the murder into comic narrative.</p> <p><strong>The Talented Mr Ripley</strong>, by Patricia Highsmith</p> <p>Ripley, the amoral anti-hero, kills quite a few people in the course of the four novels featuring him. The most vivid and instinctive murder is the first: Ripley is outraged at the \"blatant rudeness\" of wealthy loafer Dickie Greenleaf. So, out together in a boat off San Remo, Ripley simply (and graphically) batters his friend to death with an oar.</p> <p><strong>We Need to Talk about Kevin</strong>by Lionel Shriver</p> <p>Genuinely horrible to read, largely because the cool-blooded young murderer uses a crossbow rather than a more merciful gun. The narration is as exact as his well-practised aim.</p>",
  "<p>To celebrate having been buddies for 20 years, my friend Mike and I recently decided to take our families camping together. The reason I can even write a sentence such as that is because my wife and Mike's wife have built controlled environments for their husbands, within which we enjoy the illusion of being occasional decision-makers. Of course, what really happened was that our wives did a spot of behind-the-scenes phoning, established that there was some unmissable local event that was in fact best missed - a monster-truck rally, perhaps, or a hot-dog festival - and they schemed how to put a minimum safe distance between us and it. </p> <p>A camping weekend was their solution; the more devious because it really does sound like an idea a couple of feckless blokes would have come up with. I don't like to think how Mike's wife controls his mind. Mine implanted the idea by whispering in my ear as I slept. (I know she does this. I see no other reason why I would have woken up the other day and rushed out to buy a wok. I still haven't worked out how to wear it.)</p> <p>All I know is that Mike and I awoke to find ourselves piloting our family cars towards an environmentally friendly campsite near Chichester, West Sussex. Our vehicles were full of our devious wives, our shrieking infants and our gaudy, diabolical tents. The campsite was full of well-behaved children in expensive soy-coloured yurts. </p> <p>Our heads were full of the notion that the trip was our idea. The reason Mike and I know it can't have been is that the weekend was extremely poorly planned. As we arrived at the campsite on Friday evening and began erecting our tents, we noticed that the campers closest to us were all doing the opposite and moving out. </p> <p>We naturally assumed this was because of our brilliantly loud kids. Had we troubled to check the weekend weather forecast, we would have known the real reason: a storm of unprecedented savagery was headed directly for us. The Met Office has a weather icon for rain, and it has one for heavy rain. It hasn't yet developed a visual language for \"only come here by boat\". A good way to convey how wet our weekend was about to become would have been to relocate the shore of the Channel slightly to the north of Carlisle. </p> <p>The first bolt of lightning struck at midnight with primeval ferocity. The ground shuddered. The storm broke in pitch darkness, and naturally the children had exhausted our torch battery while pretending it was a lightsaber, so there was blind panic in our tent when the great rains began. Within minutes, the water rose over our groundsheet. We sat the kids up on the cool box and groped for our sleeping bags in the flood water, while lightning strobed on the tent walls and the wind tore a hole in the flysheet. </p> <p>\"Daddy,\" said our four-year-old, \"will the lightning actually make us die?\" I reassured him: \"Relax - there's no way the greatest force in nature could possibly get through these walls of ripstop nylon.\" My wife shot me a look that would have been fair if this trip had been, say, 50% my idea. From all around came the screams of terrified yurt-dwellers, milling in semi-clothed anguish like the damned souls in a Hieronymus Bosch tableau. This wasn't camping: this was Campageddon.</p> <p>Yet it was also a time of marvels. Families joined each other quite spontaneously to bang in extra tent pegs and help keep each other's children semi-dry. We made friends with our snooty neighbours and we all mucked in together, cursing but strangely fortified, somewhere on that continuum of adversity where the British are revealed for what they are: a plucky island race who should pay more attention to meteorology.</p> <p>At dawn, the storm abated and the flood waters receded to reveal the shattered remains of tents. Mike and I stood, drenched, and surveyed the devastation in the flat, grey light. We exchanged a sheepish grin. I guess we would have felt pretty silly if the whole thing hadn't been our wives' idea all along.</p> <p>Chris Cleave's new novel, The Other Hand, is in bookshops now.</p>",

  "<p>Davina Gounden is completing her master's degree in migration studies at Queen Mary, University of London and she is keen to work for an international organisation. \"My first degree was very general, so I wanted to study something that was more specific,\" she explains. \"I did my undergraduate dissertation on immigration in France and found it very interesting, so I wanted to keep studying that. The course covers everything from theories of migration to the simple facts of just why you get movements of people from different countries.\" She is also trilingual and enthusiastic about working in different places. \"I can speak English, French and Spanish,\" she says. \"Working abroad wouldn't be a problem for me at all.\"</p> <p>We asked Amelia Bookstein Kyazze, head of humanitarian policy at Save The Children UK, to mock-interview Gounden for an entry-level job. Then we asked her what she thought. </p> <p>\"Save The Children is one of the largest humanitarian and development organisations in the world,\" she explains. \"We work in about 100 countries doing rapid response or development work, all based on the framework of children's rights.\"</p> <p>Bookstein Kyazze explains that her team works on a variety of projects. \"It can be very fast, responding to disasters,\" she says, \"or working on slow onset problems or long-term human rights abuses. We work out how to research and work with the media and with policy makers, and we translate that into communications with governments, the UN, our supporters and the press.\" She emphasises that people she works with need to be able to recognise opportunities and risks quickly, and be able to think strategically. \"You need a good idea of what is going on in the world,\" she says, \"to be able to pull ideas together.</p> <p>\"We're definitely looking for problem solvers, for people who can go into stressful situations and can operate in that environment, and people who are cheerful, that's always a good sign.\" She also looks for people who are knowledgeable about Save the Children. \"People who know why we're different and know about our campaigns,\" she says. </p> <p>Good communication skills, a positive approach and a willingness to think about the audience you're trying to reach are also key, as is enthusiasm. \"We're really ambitious here and you must want to be part of something big.\"</p> <p>Gounden came across well in the interview, says Bookstein Kyazze. \"She described herself as determined, and I think she probably is.\"</p> <p>The fact that Gounden speaks three languages is a \"huge asset\" says Bookstein Kyazze, \"but she needs to work on how she sells herself a bit more. It took us a while to find out that she'd volunteered at a children's charity and done work experience at the Mauritian embassy in Spain.\" </p> <p>Gounden also revealed an interest in relevant media. \"She was able to list all these documentaries she's seen and talk very well about them. That would be a real advantage in a media role, for example, and she seemed not to realise that it was unusual and good.\"</p> <p>Because of her academic background, Gounden's skills would also mean she was well placed for a research role. \"She should remember to always make a connection between her work and what we do,\" advises Bookstein Kyazze. </p> <p>Gounden found the interview a useful experience. \"I was a bit nervous,\" she says, \"but they were really nice, even though it was a formal interview.\" Most helpful to her was being interviewed by specialists in the same area as she had been studying. \"I've never had an interview with people so close to my own area of research before,\" she says, \"so it was really helpful to have an idea about the kind of questions I'll be asked in future interviews.\"</p> <p>If you are an undergraduate or recent graduate in need of a career blind date, send your CV to graduate@theguardian.com </p> <h2>Questions asked</h2> <p>\u00b7 What would you say are the most pressing humanitarian debates and issues today? </p> <p>\u00b7 What would the differences be between writing a master's degree and writing material for Save the Children?</p> <p>\u00b7 How familiar are you with production technologies?

  "<p>Would you burst with pride if your children wanted to do the same job as you - or would you try to persuade them not to?</p> <p>If you love your work you might be thrilled and flattered. Equally you could feel concern, maybe even - admit it - a mite disappointed that they aren't going to be an astronaut after all.</p> <p>Teachers Gwen and Mike Gledhill say they were pleased when their daughter Jo, now 24, decided to follow them into schools - though not for the reasons you'd think. \"It's so much more professional now, far better than when I started,\" says Gwen, assistant head at Westwood college in Leek, Staffordshire. \"I was delighted but I can't say that would have been the case 15 years ago.\" </p> <p>To those outside teaching, the classroom looks daunting. Then there's all that paperwork and all those Whitehall initiatives. But Mike, who is head of the Kingsway school in Stockport, insists there's never been a better time to be a teacher. </p> <p>\"There's so much more support now,\" he says. \"We learned most of it on the job but now students are taught how to teach and there's clear career progression. We knew Jo had considered it very carefully - that was key. She's spent time in schools and knows you have to be very committed. You've got to really live it.\"</p> <p>Once teaching was seen, for some, as a fallback career. That attitude won't do today. \"For all the problems people associate with teaching, it's better paid now and enjoys higher status than it used to,\" adds Mike.</p> <p>When NHS communications worker Loren Grant read English at university she envied those studying law or medicine because they had their careers mapped out. \"I was so desperate to leave home, I took anything - and fell into a series of disconnected jobs vaguely related to journalism and public relations. I wanted better for my son Jaimie and was thrilled when, aged 12, he decided he wanted to be a lawyer.\"</p> <p>Grant thought Jaimie, now 22, would have more direction and security in his life than she had experienced. \"But then I read Carl Jung, who said that the greatest burden for the child is the unlived life of the parent. That shocked me, so I tried not to push him any more. He went off law anyway and is now doing very similar work to me with the Media Trust. </p> <p>\"He grew up in a politically aware household but seemed to reject our views,\" Grant adds. \"What switched him on to politics was a teacher at school and the Iraq war - he's passionate now about politics and international development. Till then, I kept thinking the worst punishment for me would be for him to turn out a Tory. But he had to be his own person. I'm just so very pleased he cares about the things that matter to his parents.\"</p> <p>As you'd expect, psychologists have much to say about children following their parents' careers. \"There's less social mobility than there used to be and research shows more children are, if not exactly following their parents, then certainly staying in the same social class,\" comments Professor Nigel Nicholson, of London Business School and author of Family Wars (Kogan Page). Musical, acting, sporting and literary worlds have always had their dynasties. And in medicine, a high proportion have a parent who has also worked in that field. </p> <p>But it's not, according to Nicholson, simply a question of genes: \"They are a lottery; lots of things don't run in families,\" he says. \"Probably more important is the type of schooling a child receives, though the parents' milieu is inevitably going to be influential.</p> <p>\"I have five children and none of them are academics. Frankly, I'd be slightly discomfited if they were. I have very strong views and would worry I'd had too much influence on them. My eldest son did start doing psychology with law, then went into law. I suppose it would've been nice if he'd continued in psychology but ultimately not healthy. I have colleagues whose kids are in psychology and they didn't want it either.\"</p> <p>Chartered corporate psychologist Ben Williams says it's often assumed that bright parents have bright kids - but that's not necessarily the case. \"There's what we call 'gravitation to the mean' so intelligent people don't necessarily have intelligent kids and people with low levels of intelligence may well have children who are highly intelligent. A bright father who's an engineer might be disappointed with a son who doesn't show aptitude for science. And equally, very artistic, socially aware parents may be upset if their daughter wants to be a tax accountant rather than being creative.\"</p> <p>Often children turn to a parent's career after trying something else. Neither of tree surgeon Hugh Williams's sons - Ben, 26 and Joel, 22 - had thought about tree surgery. Ben went into leisure management, but one day rang his father saying he'd had enough of working in an office, and asked if he could come and work for him instead.</p> <p>\"I was concerned at first that Ben couldn't think what else to do,\" recalls his mother, Heather, who helps run their family business, Tree Heritage. \"Now I realise it's because he's always seen his father loving his work. Plus he's been brought up with his parents running a business so he's used to it. It's a way of life, not just a job.\" </p> <p>Joel, too, decided against his original choice of engineering design and opted for tree surgery. \"It's worked out very well,\" says Hugh. But I didn't push or encourage them because it's a hard, physical job, utterly exhausting, and do you really want that for your kids? But they, like me, wanted to work outside in different environments.\" </p> <p>Heather admits it can get a bit all-consuming at times in a home never free of business concerns and with holidays frequently interrupted by emergency tree jobs. \"But it means the business can continue. Instead of being gradually wound down, as we expected at this time of our lives, it's being slowly handed over to them. That's a lovely feeling.\" </p> <p>But choosing the same career as one's parents can sometimes indicate \"insecure attachment\", where a child isn't sure of their parents' love so tries to please them, warns Professor John Arnold, chartered occupational psychologist at Loughborough University Business School. </p> <p>\"In such cases, it's probably unhelpful,\" Arnold says. \"But a more secure attachment, which these examples sound like, where the child admires their parents and what they do, is much more positive. What could be more complimentary than your child saying, 'I really value what you are and want to emulate that'?\"</p> <h2>Kindred spirits</h2> <p><strong>Those who made it ...</strong></p> <p><strong>Hilary Benn</strong> <strong>Politician </strong>Like his father Tony, a Labour party cabinet minister. </p> <p><strong>Jamie Redknapp</strong> <strong>Footballer </strong>Father Harry played for, then later managed, West Ham; Jamie played for Liverpool, Tottenham and England. </p> <p><strong>Emilia Fox</strong> <strong>Actor </strong>Daughter of Edward, niece of James; currently stars in the BBC1 drama Silent Witness. </p> <p><strong>Zak Starkey</strong> <strong>Drummer </strong>Son of Ringo; has beaten the skins with Oasis, the Lightning Seeds and the Who. </p> <p><strong>...

  "<p>July was a pretty average month for the Metropolitan police; 18 people were murdered, 689 were knifed or battered with a weapon, 15,824 were beaten up or seriously harassed and there were 225 rapes. </p> <p>Four of those who died were teenagers, all of them black victims of growing youth violence. The youngest was just 14; stabbed through the heart on a summer evening on his way to a football game. </p> <p>The outsider might believe that in the corridors of Scotland Yard, at management meetings and at the forefront of every single mind within the Met, these figures, and those teenage deaths, must have dominated. But the whispers from every rank strongly suggest otherwise.</p> <p>Nearly 10 years on from the Macpherson report into the death of Stephen Lawrence, the Met and its commissioner Sir Ian Blair - ironically one of the most liberal to date - appear to be engaged in an all out race war with black and Asian staff. </p> <p>Yasmin Rehman, the force's head of diversity, became the latest to publicly announce she was suing the Met for racial discrimination this week, following the high profile claim by assistant commissioner Tarique Ghaffur and the case of commander Shabir Hussain. And there are likely to be more to come.</p> <p>Next week the National Black Police Association will escalate the dispute with its plans for a march on the Yard, a public campaign to urge young ethnic minorities not to join the Met and a vote of no confidence in the force's leadership. </p> <p>In addition, in a few days time Blair and his force will face their greatest scrutiny since the Lawrence inquiry at the inquest into the fatal shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, the Brazilian mistakenly thought to be a terrorist; a hearing which many fear will expose damning details about the operational effectiveness of the force on that day, and the overall efficacy of its current leadership. </p> <p>What then of policing London, of disturbing crime statistics reflecting a growing violent youth crime problem and the terrorist threat? One senior officer was unequivocal. \"How does the force operate? It can't operate with all this going on. People are spending their time focusing on defending the reputation of the Met. Just imagine what amount of time is being dedicated to all this at management board meetings when it should be what is going on outside that is the issue.\"</p> <p>Morale, at the moment, appears to be holding up as officers rely on humour to get them through. \"It's become a thing of amusement,\" one said. \"Having said that none of us wants to see the force become a laughing stock. And for most of us the feeling is there are more important issues to focus on - like crime? Knifings and shootings perhaps?\"</p> <p>Those who have worked with the force in the nine years since the Macpherson report to improve race relations do not believe it is fundamentally racist. \"Is the Met a racist hotbed? Absolutely not,\" said one adviser. \"It has done more than any other organisation in the UK to change. It is not perfect but it has made huge advances.\"</p> <p>But the National Black Police Association, led by commander Ali Dizaei, says race discrimination claims have doubled in the last two years. </p> <p>They say only one person has been promoted to chief inspector rank in the last six years although there has been no shortage of applicants and that the six most senior black and Asian officers have made or are making employment tribunal claims for racial discrimination. They blame a failure of leadership from Blair which has allowed those beneath him to exercise prejudice when awarding promotions.</p> <p>Dizaei has his own reasons for feeling bitter about the Met - he was subjected to a multimillion pound inquiry into corruption allegations and eventually acquitted of all criminal charges and reinstated. </p> <p>This week the picture was complicated further when Shahrokh Mireskandari, the lawyer chosen by Dizaei to represent Ghaffur, Rehman and others in their race tribunals, faced allegations about his background in the Daily Mail. Mireskandari, who has threatened to destroy Blair's \"golden circle\" of white officers, has earned a mention in Hansard for bankrupting a client in his pursuit of legal fees. In another judgment his fees were described by a high court judge as \"exceptionally high\". In a further case a judge slashed his fees by 75% percent.</p> <p>Sources close to Dizaei say, however, he has total faith in Mireskandari, who is threatening to sue for libel. But the case has led some officers to question Dizaei's judgement. \"There are ethnic minority officers who believe a more conciliatory approach should be taken and not an orchestrated campaign,\" said one.</p> <p>And yesterday the Metropolitan Police Authority said it was investigating Dizaei for alleged misconduct over another matter - helping Mireskhandari defend a woman facing prosecution by the Met for death by dangerous driving. Dizaei denies wrongdoing.</p> <p>How Blair brings the Met out of its crisis will be a test of his much-criticised leadership. Many believe he is reaping what he has sowed and the repair job will have to be carried out by another commissioner.</p> <p>Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, has been making clear Blair retains her confidence. But Cindy Butts, deputy chair of the Metropolitan Police Authority, believes public confidence in the force is falling away. \"We have two major issues to tackle, terrorism and youth crime. </p> <p>\"Both demand good working relationships between ethnic minority communities and the police. This is too big an issue to be hijacked by the playing out of differences within the service.\"</p> <h2>Main players</h2> <p><strong>Sir Ian Blair</strong> <br>Became commissioner in February 2005.

  "<p>In recent years we have had a lot of moths but they now seem to be everywhere. Most of my clothes are ruined. I've tried mothballs but they stink. The last straw was when I pulled out my favourite jacket - they've eaten right across the front of it. Any suggestions? <br><strong>Rosaleen, London</strong></p> <p>When you say they are everywhere, you probably mean the adult moth. There are three common clothes moths in this country and, of those, one is prevalent: the webbing moth. It is rather beautiful, fairly small (7mm-10mm long) and a golden caramel colour. It's not the adults that do the damage, but the caterpillars. You don't generally see the adults in winter (I realise it's still meant to be summer, but ... ), although Gaden Robinson, an entomologist at the Natural History Museum, advises that if houses are kept above 20C constantly, moths will reproduce all year (otherwise they only do so twice a year). </p> <p>Most commercially available deterrents will only keep away the adult moth. This is of little use if the eggs have already been laid - and it's impossible to tell with the naked eye if they have. Here are some tips for storing clothes: Robinson says that \"no stage of a moth's life cycle can withstand laundering or dry cleaning\". It's imperative that immediately after doing this you store it in a garment bag. Plastic sealable freezer bags are great for jumpers and smaller items. Don't do what I did and put a once-worn jumper in a sealed plastic bag, only to come back to it four months later to find that yes, I had contained the damage, but my wonderful cashmere jumper now had most of the front missing.</p> <p>So before packing anything away, dry clean or wash it. If in doubt, or you can't clean it, seal the item in a plastic bag and put it in the freezer. A temperature of minus 28C-32C is ideal for seven to 10 days. If your freezer doesn't go that low, just store the item for longer. This will kill any eggs you can't see. Vacuum the insides of cupboards and, to be on the safe side, put clingfilm over the hose opening in between vacuums as inside vacuum bags is heaven for hatching moths. Put away everything in garment bags and then hang moth deterrents, but - and this is probably where you've also been going wrong, as it's where everyone goes wrong - you need to change them regularly, whatever you use. I would recommend every three months. Also, moths love dark, quiet places, so in a sense the worst thing we can do is hide away our precious clothes for ages. Every month, it's worth checking how things are doing. Be aware that at normal room temperature the time between eggs being laid and hatching is a week to 10 days, so the damage can happen quite fast.</p> <p>Ikea (<a href=\"http://ikea.com\">ikea.com</a>) has some good, cheap products to help you in your battle. Its Trofast box system starts at \u00a31.50. The lid doesn't clip on but once in place it's impossible to penetrate. The boxes stack, too. Garment bags are super cheap from there - the range is called Svajs and it costs \u00a31.59 for three. The quality isn't fantastic, though, so check for tearing regularly. For really important clothes, I recommend cotton garment cover bags: not cheap but they last for ever. Total Wardrobe Care <a href=\"http://www.totalwardrobecare.co.uk\">www.totalwardrobecare.co.uk</a>, 020-7498 4360) sells some beautiful ones. Each bag holds six to eight garments and comes in small, medium or large sizes, \u00a315-\u00a320. You can also store cashmere jumpers in an old cotton pillowcase but make sure a) there are no holes and b) it is sealed - a Jumbo Klippit from Lakeland, \u00a32.99 for four, is perfect here (<a href=\"http://lakeland.co.uk\">lakeland.co.uk</a>, 015394 88100). </p> <p>Also from Lakeland is the Cedar Wood Set, (code 20188), \u00a35.99 for 30 pieces, which you can put on hangers and scatter in drawers. Just revitalise the smell by sanding them lightly and adding more cedarwood oil (nealsyard remedies.com, \u00a35 a bottle, which will last for years). Total Wardrobe Care also sells chic natural products to hang or put in drawers, including a pheromone trap Moth Box, \u00a37; Anti-Moth Sachet, \u00a35; and 10 Anti-Moth Ovals, \u00a35. It's crucial to keep the smell active by adding more essential oils or replacing them. Don't expect them to last all year once you've put them in the cupboard.</p>",
  "<h2>Cycle in a traffic-free London</h2> <p>Imagine the thrill of cycling along Victoria Embankment or through Blackfriars underpass without fear of being mangled by a juggernaut or bashed by a bendy bus. September 21 sees the London Freewheel, a day when key routes are barred to traffic and you can breeze through much of the capital without a care. We were among 40,000 people of all ages who enjoyed last year's event. Our girls were dubious at first but later pleaded to do the 12km circuit twice. </p> <p>As well as a perfect way to see the landmarks, from Buckingham Palace to the London Eye and the Tower, there's the camaraderie of thousands of families enjoying an experience that seems somehow mischievous. You can also whizz round Trafalgar Square, which on a normal day would be heart-stopping with young children. With flat, wide thoroughfares and helpful marshals pointing you in the right direction, it's ideal for lapsed or fair-weather cyclists.</p> <p>There's a rest zone in the Mall and entertainment en route, including demonstrations of unusual and vintage bikes, pedal-powered sound systems, mobile jugglers and the graceful cycling angels. Though previous road experience isn't essential, whether you beg, borrow or use your own bikes, do check for roadworthiness. Bring water as cycling is thirsty work, even on a cool day. A bell is useful, if only to contribute to the cacophony of sound in the designated \"noisy\" part of the route. Who said bikes had to be quiet and sedate?</p> <p>The event is free, with the main route open from 9.30am to 4.30pm. Organised rides from four outer hubs will lead riders to the traffic-free section.

You can today - the Bristol Old Vic is one of dozens of buildings putting up welcome signs during Bristol Doors Open Day. It's a great opportunity to see the working parts of a major city, and opening doors normally closed to the general public could stimulate career aspirations in the young ones. There's a wide range of attractions - check out God's back office admin centre at Bristol Cathedral, see if Casualty (which is filmed in the city) is in any way realistic at the Queen Elizabeth hospital, or hold your nose and take a trip around a sewage treatment works. Whichever insightful route you take around the city, it might be worth ending up at St Paul's at 5pm, when Circomedia presents a family cabaret show. </p> <p>And once you've finished exploring Bristol, why not move on to London, whose open house is next weekend?</p> <p>Various venues around Bristol today.

The Kent &amp; East Sussex Railway is recreating it all this weekend: everyone is invited to experience life as a hopper. </p> <p>In a rustic camp, complete with its austere living hut, all ages can have a go at handling the hops (left), stripping them from the wiry bines, in preparation for the farmer's daily rounds. Come dressed as hop-pickers of the 40s or 50s (simple accessories such as scarves, cloth caps or aprons fit the bill). Vintage tractors, commercial vehicles and farming machinery decorate the scene, with refreshments from the wartime rationing era and characters such as a spiv trying to sell black-market nylons.

First we make a kit of tape measure, notebook, pen and super-sized matches. Then we start our energy audit looking for draughts, flimsy window coverings, gappy floorboards and absent insulation. My role is to ensure the girls know that it costs money to heat space. \"Money that could be spent on sweets instead,\" I say shamelessly. Their mission is to find all the ways heat escapes from the house. We light a match by the cellar door: both flame and smoke go straight up. \"That means it's well draught-proofed,\" I bluff, smugly. But at the back door the smoke angles off at 90 degrees, indicating a major draught. The front door is as bad. Nell uses her fingers to locate the air stream, then measures the gaps so that I can fit a draught excluder.</p> <p>In the sitting room I challenge my auditors to find the place where most heat escapes, hinting that it is big enough for a child to hide in.

  "<p>Convertibles are difficult things. They are undeniably fun - the wind in your hair, the sky above, diesel fumes from buses, all that. But it's very hard not to look like a wanker in one, especially for men. If you see a man in a BMW Z4, for example, wearing sunglasses, with the hood down, there are two acceptable things to think: big cock and little cock (he is and he has got, respectively). Or both, so actually three. You should point at his car and laugh loudly, or point at him and make the internationally recognised sign for small finger - waggle your little willy at him... Erm, something went wrong with that sentence, but you know what I mean. Anyway, try it. It's fun. </p> <p>The alternative is something that isn't a sports car, but simply a convertible version of a car that usually has a hard roof. A Beetle, say, or a Mini. These are more acceptable (these are not opinions I'm expressing, but facts), and practical if there are more than two of you, but they also tend to be more cutesy. Girls' cars, basically. So what's the solution, if you're not a girl? A convertible Vauxhall Vectra? Don't be daft: taking the roof off a Vectra is like putting caviar on Mother's Pride, if you get my drift. A BMW 3 series? Too many people will try to buy drugs from you. An Audi A4? Not bad, a bit Sloaney.</p> <p>Or this, the Sloane's little sister, Audi's new baby soft top, the A3 Cabriolet. Yes, it is cute, girls would love it - do love it (of the one girl I asked, 100% said she loved it). But such is the desirability of this little car it transcends the normal sex barriers - a bit like an iPod nano, with wheels. </p> <p>I know you're not supposed to like cars any more, but I really do like this one. Look at it, it's lovely. And driving around with the top down, I don't feel like too much of a wanker, either. The one I try has the smaller, 1.8-litre engine; it isn't especially sporty, but that doesn't matter. I'm ambling around the Chilterns, sucking in the summer, and looking directly up at reeling red kites. Hope they don't poo on my Luxor beige Vienna leather seats...</p> <p>The worst thing that can happen to you in a convertible - worse, even, than being pooed on by a large bird of prey - is for you to decide at a red light to press the button to put the roof up or down, but then for the light to go green while the roof is still folding or unfolding itself. The people behind are all honking, shouting abuse at you and making the internationally recognisable sign for wanker. It's not pleasant. But the chances of that happening in this one have been considerably reduced simply because it does its folding and unfolding remarkably quickly: it went down in 9.69 seconds by my watch. This car has the Usain Bolt of roofs. </p> <p>They don't come cheap. The basic car is \u00a323,500. And it's easy to bump that up. As well as the Luxor beige Vienna leather, this one has a whole lot of extras - including walnut-brown inlays, cruise control, heated front seats, and an acoustic parking system - and the total cost is \u00a327,940.

  "<p>Backstage at the St Barnabas community fete in Mile End Park, east London, a mood of mild panic has settled on Heavy Load, a band who like to style themselves as \"Lewes' answer to the Ramones\". The panic isn't really about how their set will be received, although it's hard not to feel that even the audience at St Barnabas - who have thus far been entertained by an eclectic line-up, including a jazz trio, a demonstration of Sikh martial arts, the late Ian Dury's former backing band the Blockheads and the local vicar singing I Fought The Law - are unprepared for Heavy Load's music, a foul-mouthed take on 60s garage punk so chaotic that even the band's members seem at a loss to describe it. \"We sometimes say we sound like the Fall having a bare-knuckle fight with Bros,\" offers bass player Paul Richards, hopefully. It's more about the actual members of the band - or rather, the one missing member. </p> <p>Heavy Load prefer not to advertise that three of their members - drummer Michael White, singer Simon Barker and guitarist Jimmy Nichols - have learning disabilities, partly because they want to be seen first as a band, not as disability advocates, and partly out of a certain up-yours punk rock spirit. \"We want to let people work it out for themselves,\" Richards says. \"I hate it at concerts when artists say, 'I'm sorry, I've got a cold' or something. You shouldn't make excuses for your performance. You should just get up there and do it.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, at St Barnabas, it's swiftly becoming clear that life in Britain's first disabled punk band brings unique challenges. White, who has Down's syndrome, has vanished. \"Is he in the Portaloo?\" asks guitarist Mick Williams. \"Last time he went into a Portaloo before a gig, we couldn't get him out.\" </p> <p>Barker, meanwhile, tries to calm his pre-gig nerves - he says he sometimes suffers seizures on stage due to flashing lights - by demonstrating his stage moves to his support worker. \"Last night I did this,\" he says, throwing himself on his back and kicking his legs in the air. It's a dramatic move of which Iggy Pop would be proud, but Barker's support worker seems less impressed. He's an enthusiastic fan of the band, taking photographs for their website, but this is the third Heavy Load gig he's attended in as many days, and his expression is beginning to take on a definite hint of weariness. \"Simon, the grass is wet,\" he says quietly but firmly. \"I think you should get up.\"</p> <p>And Nichols has spotted something that has piqued his interest more than Heavy Load's imminent gig - a passing Volkswagen Beetle - and has headed out of the backstage area to investigate further, his eyes hidden behind the enormous pair of wraparound sunglasses that he wears on stage. As Williams has noted, these make him look not unlike a member of the Velvet Underground, albeit a member of the Velvet Underground currently pursuing a Volkswagen Beetle through an east London community fete with a guitar slung around his neck. </p> <p>\"Jimmy!\" shouts Richards, weakly. \"Jimmy! Come back!\" </p> <p>It's a prime example of what the band's website cheerfully describes as \"all the randomness that comes with The Load\". As is underlined by Heavy Load: A Film About Happiness - a documentary that follows the band for two turbulent years and that recently won the Audience Award at the BritDoc Festival - Heavy Load seem to thrive in a state of perpetual mayhem that would cause any other band to throw in the towel. But then, as it swiftly becomes apparent, Heavy Load are not any other band. A few days before the St Barnabas fete, I meet them at a Brighton rehearsal studio. They have three gigs booked over the coming weekend, but don't seem particularly interested in rehearsing. They play two songs: a cover of Kylie Minogue's Can't Get You Out Of My Head that in Heavy Load's hands sounds catastrophic, like chucking-out time at a particularly rowdy pub, and one of their own called We Love George Michael, a hearty thumbs-up for the former Wham! frontman's sexual preferences: \"We love George Michael,\" bellow Barker and Williams, more or less in unison, \"because he's gay at weekends and gay in the week.\" When the song suddenly speeds up before crashing to an undignified halt, rehearsals seem to be over. \"We don't really rehearse much,\" Williams says. \"It destroys our spontaneity.\" You can't help feeling that this attitude may be a factor in their proud boast that, in 12 years, Heavy Load's music has \"neither improved nor deteriorated\".</p> <p>They formed when Williams was employed by the Southdown Housing Association, a not-for-profit organisation that works with vulnerable people in Sussex. He discovered that Nichols, a Southdown tenant, played guitar and had \"a love of going to pubs and seeing bands. We started chatting about putting a band together. We sent a memo round, and within a week we were rehearsing.\" </p> <p>Richards, another Southdown worker, joined when their original bass player \"fell off a bar stool and broke his arm\". They settled on playing garage punk partly because of its simplicity - what nascent rock band hasn't fumbled their way through the Troggs' Wild Thing? - and partly because its anti-establishment stance accommodates Barker's unique vocal style. He has, as his support worker tactfully puts it, a tendency unexpectedly to shout out \"inappropriate things\", as I discover while trying to interview him. \"I'll interview you,\" he interrupts. \"How's your sex life?\" </p> <p>Besides, it's the only music on which the band members can agree. Williams and Richards like indie rock, White is a fan of both early rock'n'roll and, more unexpectedly, boybands including Blue and Westlife. Barker, meanwhile, says he likes Michael Bolton, Bros, George Michael, Rick Astley. \"He's got some terrible records,\" Williams sighs sadly. </p> <p>Perhaps understandably, their early live performances at disabled club nights generated a measure of controversy. \"Some people really dug it and other people couldn't really understand what was going on,\" Richards says, a hint of pride in his voice. \"We played at a Mencap event and they told us to turn it down. We played at my local community fete and divided the audience. The WI cake stall complained, which we took as a compliment.\" </p> <p>\"I suspect that, in the past, they've been given gigs as a kind of charitable act,\" says Jerry Rothwell, the director of Heavy Load: A Film About Happiness. \"Then they'd start playing, come out with this stuff and people would either get it or leave very quickly.\" Whatever you think of Heavy Load's ramshackle, confrontational, obscenity-laden brand of rock, it certainly militates against charity, pity or any of the usual kneejerk reactions that disability provokes. </p> <p>They received an unexpected boost two years ago, when Rothwell - best known for Deep Water, an acclaimed documentary about businessman Donald Crowhurst's attempt to compete in the 1968 Golden Globe round-the-world yacht race - began filming: \"I came across this Mencap newsletter in my doctor's surgery,\" he says, \"and there was this photo of a band with learning disabilities who did a version of I Fought The Law. I just thought, that's a great combination.\" </p> <p>Uproariously funny and moving in equal measure, the documentary captures the band's attempts to record their debut album, perform in \"mainstream venues\" ranging from Nichols' local pub to the Wychwood Festival, and start their Stay Up Late campaign, which fights for people with learning disabilities' \"right to party\", frequently curtailed by their support workers' desire to clock off at 9pm. Equally gripping, it shows the band's ability to triumph over their own apparently perpetual state of disarray. Midway through filming, Williams leaves Sussex to begin a new life with his family in France (he now flies to Britain whenever Heavy Load have a gig). Meanwhile White, who Rothwell notes \"has a huge ego that obviously the film fed\", continually threatens to quit the band over musical differences. At one juncture, a particularly vicious row erupts over the merits of Westlife. \"Michael said he hated me,\" says a shattered-looking Richards in its aftermath. \"He said, 'I hate Paul Richards and I hate his beard.' \"</p> <p>The film's ongoing success has sent Heavy Load's career spiralling in a manner Williams describes as \"ludicrous, quite outrageous\". They have recorded a second album, Shut It, this time entirely of their own songs, based around Barker's utterances, some deeply prosaic (We're All In A Film), some flatly baffling (Is Bruce Forsyth Dead?). They're increasingly asked to play at mainstream venues, where they've been startled by the overwhelmingly positive audience reaction. \"Initially you can see people have this look of horror, but by the end they're totally into it. I think they get off on the fun we have on stage.\" </p> <p>The Stay Up Late campaign has garnered worldwide support, too. They recently played live in New York, an experience Barker describes as \"all right\" and Richards as \"wild, better than I could have expected - all the things that could have gone wrong and none did.\" He thinks for a moment: \"Apart from Simon saying 'piss' and 'bollocks' on live radio.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, a certain underlying tension is still detectable. While I'm with them, Heavy Load display an apparently bottomless capacity to bicker about music - the delicate subject of Westlife, for example, rears its ugly head on a couple of other occasions - and while White professes to be \"a little bit happier\", he still manages to announce his imminent departure. \"I'm going to live in Los Angeles in America,\" he says, to baffled looks from his bandmates. \"Actually, I'm going to do drama group, study acting, and after that I shall be a film star in Hollywood.\"</p> <p>A stunned silence falls. \"That's the first you've told us about it,\" Williams splutters. \"Michael's always got a lot of plans going on, haven't you? He'll always tell us when there's something he doesn't like.\"</p> <p>\"I want to do my own band,\" White says, \"and I'm still going to do that at the end of this year.\" </p> <p>\"The idea was you were going to try to do that and Heavy Load at the same time, right?\" Richards frowns, before adding, \"You're going to be the Phil Collins of Heavy Load. Hopefully, you'll be better than Phil Collins. I hate Phil Collins.\" And another row about music bursts into life. </p> <p>It seems to have been resolved by the time they arrive in Mile End: two intervening gigs at a Liverpool disability festival went well and the mood is buoyant. The members are eventually rounded up and they take to the stage, performing a wild, flailing version of Bee Bop A Lula. As predicted, the audience reaction shifts from horror to bemusement to delight. Perhaps that's a result of the music's thrilling unpredictability: you genuinely have no idea what's going to happen next. Perhaps it's down to the infectious enthusiasm that spills off the stage. It's obvious that everyone in the band is having the time of their lives. And perhaps, as Richards said, \"people just dig our sound\". </p> <p>Whatever the reason, the show ends in triumph. Enthused, the local priest runs on stage as their version of Wild Thing clatters to an earsplitting close. \"Amazing!\" he shouts into the microphone. \"Praise The Load!\" Backstage, the various members are swamped by fans. Barker runs around shaking everybody's hand, White liberally helps himself to the supply of free lager, and Williams finds himself being introduced to the lead singer of Sham 69.</p> <p>Suddenly, there's a plaintive shout from Richards: \"Has anyone seen Jimmy?\" Peering past the well-wishers, he lets out a sound somewhere between a groan and a laugh. \"I think Jimmy's still on stage.\" </p> <p>And indeed he is, apparently oblivious to the fact that the rest of Heavy Load have long departed and the roadies are setting up the next band's equipment around him. Then again, he has every right to be there. After all, the crowd are still cheering. \u00b7</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Heavy Load play the ICA in London on October 1 (details: 020-7930 3647, <a href=\"http://www.ica.org.uk\">ica.org.uk</a>).

  "<p>The story begins with eyes meeting across a crowded room. It was August 2007 at Barbara Windsor's 70th birthday party, and Diederick Santer, executive producer of EastEnders, kept noticing a woman looking at him. He recognised her as Patsy Palmer, who played Bianca Jackson until, in 1999, she flounced out in the general direction of Manchester. \"I mean, we were both with our respective partners,\" Santer adds quickly, \"but I think we both sensed that we were interested in talking to each other.\" Everything in Santer's corner office at Elstree is in hyper-colour: his deep aqua shirt, the primary red sofas. Group photos of the EastEnders cast from the big-shouldered 80s to hoop-earringed now troop across one wall, and a large TV screen relays cast and extras milling about the market on Albert Square - which is to be found, in all its disconcertingly weathered solidity, just around the corner. </p> <p>Santer called Palmer a few weeks later. They met for lunch and, \"sure enough, she was quite keen to come back\". So the very next week they met, along with series consultant Simon Ashdown and story producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, to talk about how she might achieve it. Where had Bianca been since she left? How many children did she have? Who by? Why might she return? They didn't nail it all down, but the meeting convinced them that Bianca should return. </p> <p>Four times a year, Santer, John Yorke - controller of BBC drama production - and some senior writers spend a few days just talking through every character on the show. They plan story arcs for the next year, discuss what isn't working, dream up spectaculars. (None of this can they tell anyone else; not friends, not even partners. \"It's a badge of honour, really,\" Yorke says. \"No one actually signs anything. It's like the Hippocratic oath.\") Luckily for Palmer, the next story conference was in two weeks' time. </p> <p>As usual, they split into small working groups. Ashdown was sent off with some scriptwriters to think about Bianca. He had just watched a documentary about homeless people and had been especially struck by a woman and child at a bus stop with nowhere to go. What might happen to them? They would be easy prey... What if a paedophile noticed the child, who might be, say, 12, and pretended to be the woman's saviour? She would be too grateful to notice that this was unusual behaviour, that he seemed to have few friends or family... They suggested the idea to the whole group. \"It drew a sharp intake of breath,\" Yorke says. </p> <p>Which, in soap land, is no bad thing. \"Most EastEnders stories that have been good and successful have been the ones that caused the sharp intake of breath,\" Yorke says, \"so they're always the kind of stories you look for\" - but it's not enough. \"You have to start analysing why are we doing it, can we do it, what's the point?\" The issue had, in fact, come up before, and been scuppered by just such questions. \"We knew,\" Santer says, \"that something like 16% of under-16s have been sexually abused at some point, but if you can't find a story, it's an issue that sits there, dead, on the show.\" Given the difficulty of the subject, it was not a risk they were then willing to take. </p> <p>That, perhaps, is a surprise, given that soaps so often seem to be grim catalogues of beatings, burnings, adultery, murder and general sinfulness, but paedophilia is a place to which soaps - terrestrial TV, in fact - have rarely gone, and even then quite gingerly. EastEnders has tried once: it turned out that Kat Slater was actually her sister Zoe's mother, having been raped by an uncle when she was a teenager. This was reported as having happened in the past. In 2001, Coronation Street had teenage mother Sarah-Louise Platt being groomed by a paedophile over the internet, while Brookside bade farewell to Sinbad by having him charged with abusing a nine-year-old boy; Michael Starke, who played Sinbad, insisted to the programme-makers that the audience, at least, should know that he was innocent, and worried publicly about the possibility of vigilante justice. Last year, Channel 4 aired Rowan Joffe's Secret Life, a gruelling take on the issue from a paroled paedophile's point of view, but that was a one-off, post-watershed drama; EastEnders has an average audience of 9.5 million, nearly one in six of the British population, and goes out at 7.30pm or 8pm on weekday evenings. And so Yorke, who describes his job as being \"paid to be permanently anxious\", said to Santer afterwards, \"I'm not sure about this. You're going to have to go away and do some work to convince me.\" </p> <p>\"My standpoint has always been that there has to be a good editorial justification,\" Yorke says. \"If it's just entertainment, or just sensation, or just the bogeyman in this case, then I don't think that's a good enough reason.\" The editorial policy department had to be told, and the NSPCC contacted. Would such a show have a detrimental effect? What message would it be sending out to families who may be in this situation, to young children, and to parents? </p> <p>At the same time, things were moving fast. A week later, on October 23, Santer met Sid Owen, who had played Ricky, Bianca's husband and then ex-husband, for 14 years, and suggested a return to the show. A week after that, the press office announced that Palmer would be returning to EastEnders; an announcement about Owen's return came the following day. In April, they made their first appearance, at Frank Butcher's funeral. More than 11 million people watched the episode, nearly two million more than normal. It was nothing like the 17.8 million who watched them marry in 1997, but in a multichannel universe, respectable nonetheless. In December casting began for Bianca's children, and just before Christmas 16-year-old Shona McGarty was cast as her eldest stepchild, Whitney. Santer was looking for someone \"quite spiky, quite gobby, a bit of an equal to Bianca, and in a way a version of Bianca at that age\"; McGarty was perfect.</p> <p>Characterisation began for McGarty on the ninth day of the new year, which was when she was told that she might be playing a child groomed for sex. Santer didn't ask her for an immediate decision - it was important that she should talk to her parents about it. And if her parents had objected? \"If her parents had had an objection, we'd have done something else.\" (They did object to her doing anything to publicise her part, so I was not allowed to speak either to them or to their daughter.) She started shooting on January 14.</p> <p>Work on the story began in earnest in March, when researchers Libby Duplock and Cleo Bicat contacted the NSPCC's Tom Narducci, who advises the government about safeguarding children, Jude Toasland, who has spent a lifetime dealing with abused children, and Yvonne Traynor, CEO of the Rape and Sexual Abuse Support Centre. Duplock was particularly struck by a victim statement provided by the latter, which demanded, \"How dare you make me like you?\" She insisted to the screenwriters that this should be a central element in the character of Tony, a Mancunian who, according to the back story, had one day given Bianca a lift home, three years before her return to Walford, and noticed, standing in the hallway, 12-year-old Whitney in her pyjamas. Because, as Duplock and Bicat soon discovered, it wasn't just that 16% of under-16s have experienced some form of sexual abuse that was interesting - it was how those figures broke down. According to the NSPCC, 11% of children under 16 have experienced sexual abuse by a person known but unrelated to them, often a boyfriend or girlfriend, while only 5% have been interfered with by someone unknown or whom they had just met; 1% by a parent or carer; and fewer than 1% by a professional in a position of trust, such as a teacher. </p> <p>Duplock was also surprised by the lengths to which paedophiles can go to gain that trust, often targeting a family, or child, years in advance of anything actually happening. So Tony (played by Chris Coghill, a distinctly good-looking man) started by seducing Bianca, who couldn't believe her luck, and then begins laying the groundwork so that Whitney comes to believe that the relationship between the two of them is her own idea. Whitney is now 15. On April 1, Bianca, Ricky, Whitney and her stepbrothers Liam and Morgan, and half-sister Tiffany appeared together on screen, and Tony was mentioned for the first time. When we finally meet him, he's just been released from prison, having served 12 months for beating up a boy who was allegedly bothering Whitney; in reality he was jealous. </p> <p>\"One thing that was quite difficult for me to get right was the idea that she didn't want sex,\" Duplock says. \"It's Whitney's way of keeping him happy. If she lets him do it, then he's nicer to her and he makes her feel special.\" There seems to have been less trouble with the ways in which Tony lulls her into feeling this; what is most disturbing, watching their first scenes together, is not the sexuality of the situation per se, though that is uncomfortable - it's the subtle blackmail with which he keeps her in line. As it's combined with the emotional manipulation native to soaps, the viewer starts to feel a bit bullied, too.</p> <p>There was also a great deal of soul-searching about Tony's back story. According to a study in the Lancet, only 12% of abused children go on to abuse other children and, says Duplock, \"We felt that to imply on TV that someone who has been abused is going to go on to abuse other people is not a message you want to give out. Those people have been through enough.\" At the NSPCC, Narducci, in particular, was adamant on this point. </p> <p>For the NSPCC, what was most important was that it should make children watching the show feel comfortable about asking for help if they felt they needed it. Also, says Narducci, \"for the wider community - to recognise the signs and let them know that they can do something about it.\" This sounds dangerous to me; surely levels of suspicion are high enough as it is? \"Helpline numbers will be provided at the end of each show,\" Narducci says, and counsellors will be instructed to tease out exactly what the problem is; if they feel there is no need for action, he says, they will discourage it. \"We're not trying to cause a national panic. This is a responsible effort to try to get over an important story.\" </p> <p>Coming up with a plot and characters (or storylining) is only the beginning of a process that takes, on average, five or six months. This particular story gets under way only this week but last spring writers and storyliners were already sending draft episodes to the researchers, who sent them to the NSPCC, who returned them with detailed comments. So, on April 25, Duplock was passing on the NSPCC's objections to the sexuality to be shown on screen - or at least the suddenness with which it becomes apparent; detailing the necessity of making it clear that there has been a lot of grooming, and arguing that part of Whitney's motivation might be competition with Bianca. And \"it is important not to make too much of the self-harm, as it is a different issue and will distract\". The NSPCC's changes were incorporated (self-harm was dropped) and on May 13 the first draft script arrived on Santer's desk.</p> <p>It was time to get formal approval. On June 2 Yorke wrote a memo to Jane Tranter, controller of BBC fiction, and Jay Hunt, controller of BBC1, giving them a detailed breakdown of the story, why they wanted to tell it (it would be \"a talking point\" that could \"truly educate and inform\"); with whom they'd been working; a summary of the research so far; a character sketch of Tony; and practical issues, such as the fact that they would need action lines. </p> <p>\"I thought it was a fantastically good idea,\" Tranter says. \"The big moments in EastEnders, those iconic pieces of television history, tend to be the things that are incredibly near the knuckle, and are actually quite difficult subjects to raise in the context of a family sitting room.\" But isn't that precisely the objection they will run into? That they're reaching too far for dubious effect, that the subject is too disconcerting for that time slot, and too serious for the format? Her reply is fierce. \"Well, that is the responsibility of soap! For a lot of people, the way they learn, for example, about homosexuality, will be through a soap. Soaps are meant to hold up a mirror to our lives, and sometimes that mirror will show ugly bits, difficult bits, taboo bits. But if a soap doesn't hold up that mirror, then actually, what is it? It will have no depth. And it certainly won't have a public service element.\" Public service? Surely the first thing people think of when they hear the words BBC and public service is not EastEnders... \"Well, that's to the great credit of EastEnders, then, because what it's not doing is wearing its worthiness on its sleeve. You know, we could do an issue drama on something like this and it would appear very 'public service' but actually, how much better is it to place it in the comfort zone of the soap? Youngsters won't watch a searing drama at 10pm. It's the only way to get that particular audience. And it's a really, really important thing to get out in the open.\" </p> <p>This argument works both ways. Everyone in this process is keen to stress that no physical sexuality is shown on screen, but for all the care and tastefulness that has gone into the treatment, transgression, however far off-screen, is what this story is about, and transgression - of TV norms, if nothing else - is a good part of why it will be gripping. And being gripping, and as a result raking in the audiences, is the lifeblood of a soap. Yet<strong> </strong>everyone also denies that they're just ratings-chasing. \"No, for that you'd have to blow something up, expose an affair or make it a whodunit,\" Santer says. \"Highest viewing figures ever were about 29 million, Christmas 1986, when Den served Angie divorce papers. My highest was 14.6 million, last Christmas, and in that episode an affair was revealed.\" In fact, \"we may lose people along the way\" as happened with the domestic violence strand between Little Mo and Trevor. \"A lot of people didn't want to watch it.\" After a long phone conversation, Tranter gave Yorke the go-ahead. </p> <p>Casting for Tony began when the final draft of his first episode was finished, on June 9, but there was one more step Yorke wanted to take before an actor was given the part. On June 18, he convened a summit meeting at Elstree. For an hour he threw questions at the editorial policy department, at research, at the story department, at scripts, at casting and at the press office. Were they happy with how the storyline was developing? Were they convinced they could tell the story properly before the watershed? They worried and worried over the first episode. Should Tony and Whitney kiss? There was much concern about the welfare of the actor playing Tony. In a worst-case scenario, could he be removed from the show? What kind of backup would he have?</p> <p>The next day, Thursday June 19, Chris Coghill arrived for his audition. He had been given no warning as to what the part might be. \"If they'd told me first, I might have thought twice,\" he says, sitting in a meeting room at White City, his arms tightly folded. As it was, he realised only when he was given his audition scenes and told to go outside for 15 minutes and prepare them. \"I was able to think it through. I knew by the time I walked into that room that if I was offered the job, I would probably take it.\" Why? \"It's a good part.\" A risky one, dark... \"I thought, 'How many people play murderers?' \" But murderers are two a penny on TV. Quite a few are on EastEnders. Not so paedophiles. \"It's almost a category of its own. Worryingly we live in a country where a paediatrician's house got attacked...\" </p> <p>Santer thought Coghill had \"the right combination of warmth and plausibility, and a lad-next-door quality, with something darker, more menacing\"; he and Yorke also liked the fact that Coghill had a high-profile track record on other shows, which would create distance between him and Tony. Coghill was offered the part the next day. Over the weekend, he discussed it with his agent and his wife. \"At the end of the day, it's only acting. And if I do it well, I'll continue to be an actor...\" He leans back and stares at the ceiling, arms still crossed. \"If it gets to the point where things become horrendous for me\" - he shoots a half-laughing, half-serious look at the publicist - \"the BBC will have to give me a part doing something else, very quickly.\" </p> <p>Coghill also underwent a thorough characterisation session - how old Tony liked his girls, why he short-circuited at that particular age, how long he might target them for, what colour socks he favoured. Both the BBC and Coghill are aware that Tony's characterisation requires walking a delicate line between understanding and toleration. \"You have to show him confused and conflicted and scared and worried, and all those things invite empathy,\" Yorke says. \"That's OK, but it doesn't mean you condone them. It's important that he's not just a bogeyman.\" Having said which, he adds, \"It would be patronising [to the audience] not to make Tony three-dimensional\" - not to mention make mugs of Pat Butcher, Ricky, et al. </p> <p>They were keen, too, to check whether Coghill could handle the extracurricular side of the job, because the catch-22 is that if he does it well, he'll be convincing, and some people, notes company manager Carolyn Weinstein, \"can't always divorce reality from fiction\". Mostly it's benign - she tells stories of cheques being sent in to help cash-strapped characters, actors asking which line Walford East station is on when they first report for work - but there have also been death threats. And that's on top of the incomparable amount of attention anyone gets the minute they arrive on Albert Square. A significant portion of Weinstein's job consists of warning actors what this will be like and picking up the pieces when they get it wrong; with Coghill and McGarty, everything has to be geared up several notches. </p> <p>They will not, for example, be receiving any fan mail directly. The fear with McGarty is that a child may write and ask for help; this will be replied to by Weinstein, with advice about whom to talk to, such as the NSPCC. Or, at the other end of the spectrum, there might be sexually charged fan mail: \"That'll go to the police.\" Coghill has already had a letter from a victim, hoping that the story will be dealt with properly; once he's on screen, he expects a good deal of the opposite, too. And he fully expects to have abuse shouted at him in the street. \"I'll just get a very big hat and enormous sunglasses,\" he jokes.</p> <p>Weinstein is less sanguine. She has briefed the BBC's security and investigations units who, along with the press office, will be on call to Coghill and his family 24 hours a day, for as long as they're needed - which could be well after the storyline ends. \"Yes,\" says Coghill, \"24-hour police protection. Which is reassuring but also quite unnerving.\" </p> <p>Shooting began for Coghill on June 30. He and McGarty got over the initial weirdness quite quickly - \"Shona doesn't act, or look, like a little child. Which helps,\" says Coghill feelingly. Far weirder, for him, was walking into Pat Butcher's front hall and being given the once-over by the regulars. \"It's Pat Butcher, innit?\" he says, slightly incredulously. \"Old-school EastEnders that I used to watch as a kid.\" </p> <p>Two days later, the storyline was announced to the public. On Monday Tony embarks on his post-prison life with Bianca, her extended family - and Whitney who, to his chagrin and her confusion, no longer looks like \"the 12-year-old girl I fell in love with\".</p>",

  "<p>West Ham United may take a \u00a34m hit after the collapse of their shirt sponsor, XL, midway through a three-year deal, it emerged yesterday. </p> <p>XL Airways collapsed yesterday with debts of \u00a3143m, leaving West Ham in search of a replacement partner after losing out on the remainder of a deal understood to be worth between \u00a33m and \u00a34m a year. The club last night suspended all sales of their replica shirts and will play at West Bromwich Albion today in an unbranded strip. \"West Ham United have taken the decision to immediately terminate their relationship with XL Holidays,\" said a statement on West Ham's website.</p> <p>\"In view of this, the club have suspended all sales of replica shirts until further notice. This will also involve in due course the removal of XL Holidays branding from all West Ham United platforms.\"</p> <p>At a time when the club has been criticised by its own fans over the appointment as manager of the former Chelsea player Gianfranco Zola, directors are aware of the sensitivity of reissuing replica shirts missing the sponsor's logo when supporters have already forked out for new kit at the beginning of the season.</p> <p>Despite widespread interest in sponsoring the club, West Ham has still not taken the decision over whether to accept new offers. The Hammers' financial director, Nick Igoe, yesterday insisted that Zola's transfer ambitions will not be affected by the off-the-field events. </p> <p>\"We are in an excellent financial state,\" said Igoe. \"This is unfortunate timing - we did our dealings in the summer as it is prudent to do. But we had some wind of this and we have been talking to people about the possibility of replacing XL. We will now begin to accelerate that.\"</p> <p>After selling Anton Ferdinand, George McCartney, Bobby Zamora and John Paintsil in the summer, West Ham will further reduce their squad in January. However, they insist that this decision lies with Zola and is not linked to the sponsorship issue and intend pursuing Jose Mourinho's former assistant Steve Clarke.</p> <p>Though their resources are sufficient, Zola is uncomfortable with a squad of 26 outfield players. However, if any big-name players are to leave Upton Park during the winter transfer window, reinvestment will be made, the club says. </p> <p>Those in Iceland who control West Ham's purse insist the club remains well-funded. \"There has been a \u00a330m investment from the owner [Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson] to fund the playing squad,\" said Igoe. \"That is a big, big commitment.\"</p>",
  "<p>Big bang theory? Every rugby player knows all about it, particularly the fly-half currently taking on the world single-handedly. One minute Butch James is steering South Africa to Test victories, the next he is back sloshing through the West Country ooze with Bath. In theory James is the future: the ultimate example of a have-boots-will-travel professional. In practice he has a message for subsequent generations: anyone who signs up to play non-stop throughout the year needs his head examined.</p> <p>The Springbok fly-half is able to walk unaided across the stained carpet in the Recreation Ground clubhouse, his handshake is firm and eyes clear, but once he sits down the truth soon emerges. A year ago this weekend he and South Africa were hammering England in a fateful World Cup pool game in Paris, since when James has been continually on the go, save for eight weeks rehabilitating a shoulder injury and the odd spare Tri-Nations weekend.</p> <p>Today's local derby with Gloucester will be the 34th competitive game of his endless winter - including 15 Tests - with a full Premiership season, a Heineken Cup campaign, a potential autumn tour with the Boks and a Lions series still to come. \"It's not sustainable,\" said James. \"It's pretty tough and I don't think it's advisable either. You're going to break down somewhere along the line. There's no way I could continue doing this.\"</p> <p>Hence his decision, which he says is irreversible, to quit international rugby next summer after the Lions series. As yet he is undecided whether to re-sign with Bath for the 2009-10 season or to rejoin the Sharks in Durban. If the West Country had more than a handful of warm sunny days per annum or there was surfing on the River Avon it would be a no-brainer. But James is just 29, the same age as Jonny Wilkinson, and at the peak of his game. If someone like him, a teak-tough No10 with a World Cup winner's medal in the bag, can no longer imagine combining Test and club rugby it says much about the demands of his chosen profession.</p> <p>The most likely scenario is that he will stay on in Bath, with a decision due in the next few weeks. \"Even if I did go back to the Sharks, the Lions would be the end of it. I need to give the body a break. You can feel when it's time and I think it'll be time next July.\" Mentally, as well as physically, the ceaseless grind is hard to take. \"Sometimes it's just the sight of another training pitch, especially when it's raining like it has been. It's not easy, even if the guys around you are helping you out.\"</p> <p>The biggest compliment you can pay James is that his burden rarely shows on the field. He was instrumental in last week's win over Bristol, controlling the play, sealing the No10 channel and kicking his goals, another responsibility thrust upon him since Olly Barkley moved to Kingsholm. His name implies a rogue outlaw - a mix of Butch Cassidy and Jesse James minus the horse - but he wears the metaphorical sheriff's badge. By his own admission he is a reformed hot-head. \"I wouldn't say I'm necessarily a better player but I used to run around like a chicken with its head cut off. I'm more in control nowadays.\"</p> <p>The result is a player with the judgment lacking in his old head-hunting days. Gloucester would love to reunite him with Barkley, their unfit new signing, but not everyone is so enraptured. \"I'm still public enemy No1 in the press at home,\" he said. \"They're always having a go at me, for playing badly or something else. I guess it comes with the game. If you want to read the paper when you've had a good game you've got to take it when you play badly.\" Either way, he prefers the UK. \"There's less pressure ... you don't have to worry about your parents ringing you up about what someone has said or written. It's a lot more fun over here at the moment.\"</p> <p>And, of course, the money is better. There is more to James, though, than cash-machine calculation. Talk to him about South Africa's World Cup triumph and he becomes misty-eyed. \"I often sit down and think about the World Cup, the games and the whole experience. Being a world champion is something no one can ever take away from me. Not many people ever have the opportunity to say that. We were a really good bunch of friends, too, which helps. You play a bit harder for your mates next to you.\" As a result he has been dispirited - \"it's just so sad that these things go on back home\" - to hear about the current off-field pressures bearing down on the incumbent Boks coach Peter de Villiers which James fears will stunt the team's future development.</p> <p>He has also noticed something else about his native land. \"There are a lot of guys at home who started their Test careers very young and you can see how sore their bodies are. I don't think there's any way they'll still be going into their early 30s. Someone like Schalk Burger really throws his body around in every single game. I don't think he's going to be able to play much beyond 28 if he wants to play with his kids one day.\"</p> <p>James, accordingly, has come to an understanding with his Bath boss Steve Meehan. A short break awaits later this month and a Christmas flit back to South Africa is also planned. \"I can't wait for the time to come when he tells me to clear off and take a rest.\" Serving two masters and earning shedloads of British pounds may sound attractive but the simultaneous equation exacts a heavy price. Those intent on having it all have been warned.</p>",
  "<h2>Games news</h2> <p>Since the demise of Joss Whedon's spectacularly successful TV series, fans of teenage vampire slaying have had to content themselves with the \"Season 8\" comic books, the usual tawdry selection of fan fiction, and a small quantity of crudely constructed video games, themselves now several years old. The announcement from developer Multiverse on plans to release a Buffy-based MMOG (that's massively multiplayer online game) should come as good news for those bereft of their weekly dose of Sunnydale. The rest of the announcement was less reassuring, with some peculiar talk of mixing 2D and 3D environments and releasing enhancements to the game in phases, with a public beta allegedly available by the end of the year. It was also confirmed that the planned Firefly game had merely been delayed rather than cancelled, bringing further tentative joy to Whedon-lovers.</p> <h2>Too Human, Xbox 360</h2> <p>In a plot that's less than one tenth as clever as its writers think it is, robots try and wipe out humans, who get cybernetic implants to help them fight back; but are they losing their humanity in the process? Wrapped up in a leaden bundle of recycled Norse mythology and trite voice acting, the real problems with Too Human are, appropriately enough, mechanical. To fight, you must push the right stick in the direction of those you wish to be dead. While initially fun, characters' stubborn refusal to target distant enemies makes combat partially random, a feature exacerbated by the aggressively wayward camera, which you'll instinctively try and control (as it is in every other game ever) with the right stick, only to find yourself stabbing more thin air. Onscreen instructions appear way too briefly to read them, you can't save up vital health orbs, and the unintuitive system for acquiring new skills forces you to read the dreaded instructions.

  "<p>Jacob Zuma, the leader of the ANC overcame a big obstacle to becoming South Africa's next president yesterday when a high court judge threw out fraud and corruption charges against him.</p> <p>Judge Chris Nicholson criticised prosecutors and upheld Zuma's claim that he was the victim of politically motivated charges, saying there was \"a ring of Kafka\" to the prosecution.</p> <p>Zuma was accused of racketeering, money laundering, corruption and fraud relating to arms deals with Britain, France and Germany. Nicholson threw out the prosecution on procedural grounds but ruled that there was nothing to prevent the state from relaunching the prosecution.</p> <p>But his criticism of the group around Thabo Mbeki, the president, for their handling of the prosecution made it almost impossible for the state to continue pursuing Zuma in the courts.</p> <p>In yesterday's judgement Nicholson said his ruling had nothing to do with Zuma's guilt, or innocence. But he said that the decision to prosecute Zuma appeared to have been politically motivated.</p> <p>\"I'm not convinced that the applicant was incorrect in averring political meddling in his prosecution,\" he said.</p> <p>He said Zuma should have been consulted before the national prosecuting authority resurrected corruption charges against him last year. The entire episode appears to have formed part of \"some great political contest or game,\" Nicholson said. \"There is a ring of the works of Kafka in this.\" The decision to \"prosecute the applicant is invalid and is set aside\", said the judge.</p> <p>There was jubilation in court as the judge completed his two-hour verdict, broadcast live on national television.</p> <p>Addressing an estimated 10,000 supporters outside the court house, Zuma said the case was a lesson to anyone who abuses power. \"It is a victory for democracy,\" he said. \"It is a victory for our justice system,\" he added, before yielding to pleas from the crowd to sing the anti-apartheid song Bring Me My Machine Gun.</p> <p>The ANC said the judgement vindicated their view that the prosecuting authority \"acted as though it was a law unto itself\" and that Zuma has been the \"subject of a vindictive prosecution\".</p> <p>Zuma, 66, was charged in 2005, but that case was dismissed on a technicality in 2006.

  "<p>The good times rolled last year for top executives in American boardrooms, pocketing solid pay rises in spite of the credit crunch, the sub-prime mortgage crisis and early signs of an economic slump.</p> <p>A veteran Silicon Valley technology entrepreneur topped the remuneration table. Larry Ellison, founder and chief executive of the business software company Oracle, took home $84.6m (\u00a348m).</p> <p>The billionaire America's Cup sailing fanatic fought off stiff competition to take the top-paid title. According to analysis by Associated Press, the 10 highest earners in the US included the bosses of three investment banks - Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley - and three energy and mining firms buoyed up by soaring commodity prices.</p> <p>Straitened economic conditions in the US only modestly dented the annual boardroom bonanza. A survey by Hay Group for the Wall Street Journal found compensation rose 3.5% to an average of $8.85m among chief executives of 200 top US corporations. There were few examples, however, of standout pay packages. Nobody made it into nine figures last year unlike, for example, Home Depot's Robert Nardelli who secured a $210m severance package in 2006, or Richard Fairbank of credit card firm Capital One, who scooped $280m in 2005.</p> <p>\"I don't think we've seen any particularly significant cases in the last 12 months,\" said Ryan Johnson, of employment consultants WorldatWork. The reason was straightforward - the stockmarket had a tough year which meant executive share options fared poorly.</p> <p>\"Most of the major indices were down 10% or 15% which meant you didn't have as much cashing in as usual,\" said Johnson. \"The amount of equity most US executives now have ties their personal compensation to the share price.\"</p> <p>The pay league runner-up was Merrill Lynch's John Thain who got a generous signing-on package when moving from the New York Stock Exchange. Thain received $83.1m despite the bank's losses of $19bn on mortgage-related securities, which have prompted it to sell assets and raise money from Asian sovereign wealth funds.</p> <p>In third place was Leslie Moonves of television network CBS - the maker of hits such as CSI and Everybody Loves Raymond - who got $67.6m. Behind him were the bosses of metals group Freeport-McMoRan and energy company XTO.</p> <p>US investors are not entitled to vote on executive pay packages in the way their counterparts in Britain are. Efforts to institute a \"say on pay\" vote by shareholders at annual meetings have largely failed, with a few exceptions - such as at computer maker Apple, telecoms firm Verizon and video rental empire Blockbuster - where resolutions have passed against the wishes of the board.</p> <p>Several vocal pressure groups continue to push for pay restraint. A report from the US Institute for Policy Studies, together with United for a Fair Economy, this week concluded taxpayers in effect subsidise boardroom pay to the tune of $20bn annually through loopholes allowing companies to pay executives offshore, to minimise capital gains tax or defer taxation.</p> <p>Sarah Anderson, co-author of the study, said the rewards enjoyed by energy bosses were attracting particular ire. \"They've really been cashing in even though executives admit they don't have any control over global oil prices.\" </p> <p>The presidential election has provided hope for campaigners. Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain say they support legislation presently stalled in Congress which would require companies to hold a \"say on pay\" vote annually.</p> <p>Obama favours closing a so-called \"carried interest\" loophole which limits capital gains tax on fees and bonuses. </p> <p>McCain has railed against \"rewards for failure\", when outgoing chief executives get huge payoffs, telling a group of small business leaders in June: \"Something is seriously wrong when the American people are left to bear the consequences of reckless corporate conduct, while the offenders themselves are packed off with another $40m or $50m for the road.\"</p>",
  "<p>Authors are often asked where they get their ideas from. Some will say that their plots come from newspapers, others simply from their imaginations. Most often, I think, fiction is derived from an anecdote told by a friend, though not perhaps with the intent of its being used as the basis of a story or novel. So it was with the journalist and folklorist Bertram Fletcher Robinson, who entertained his friend Sir Arthur Conan Doyle with horror stories of Devon while they were together on a golfing holiday. He told him legends of the spectral hounds that were said to roam Dartmoor, phantom creatures with red eyes, whose huntsman is Satan.</p> <p>\"My dear Robinson,\" Conan Doyle wrote to him later, \"It was your account of a west country legend which first suggested the idea of this little tale to my mind. For this, and for the help which you gave me in its evolution, all thanks.</p> <p>\"Yours most truly, A Conan Doyle.\"</p> <p>The story was The Hound of the Baskervilles and, to the great delight of Conan Doyle's readers - they were legion - Sherlock Holmes was its protagonist. Nothing unusual in that, perhaps, but for the fact that his creator had apparently killed Holmes years before. In 1896 he wrote of his detective: \"I have had such an overdose of him that I feel towards him as I do towards p\u00e2t\u00e9 de foie gras, of which I once ate too much, so that the name of it gives me a sickly feeling to this day.\"</p> <p>All in all, he wrote 56 short stories and four novels about Holmes, two narrated by Holmes himself, others in the third person and the rest told by Dr Watson. No wonder that, by the early 1890s, he wanted to try his hand at something else, in this case historical romances. \"It is with a heavy heart that I take up my pen,\" he has Watson begin what he hoped might be the final Holmes story, \"to write these last words in which I shall ever record the singular gifts by which my friend Mr Sherlock Holmes was distinguished.\" And Watson goes on to chronicle what Conan Doyle - with what relief we can imagine - called the \"final problem\". It is time for Holmes to confront his arch-enemy, the international crook Dr Moriarty, and he does so in Switzerland above a fearsome cascade, the Reichenbach Falls. For his friend and biographer Holmes has left a farewell note, anchored to a rock by his silver cigarette case. \"Any attempt at recovering the bodies was absolutely hopeless, and there, deep down in that dreadful cauldron of swirling water and seething foam, will lie for all time the most dangerous criminal and the foremost champion of the law of their generation.\" The cynical reader may say that Holmes's creator was leaving the way open for a possible resurrection of the nation's hero. </p> <p>Not that he ceased writing about Holmes once he had disposed of him. Publishers, editors and readers were dismayed by the great detective's death and, in an attempt to pacify them, he composed a Holmes play. It opened in Buffalo, New York, in 1899, toured all over the United States and was produced two years later in London. But although it was a success and a command performance was staged for King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra - the king was said to be a great admirer of Conan Doyle's early Holmes fiction - it failed to satisfy his public. They wanted more Holmes serials and more Holmes stories.</p> <p>Readers notoriously find it difficult, if not impossible, to imagine that their favourite authors can grow tired of a series character. For their part, they never tire and suppose that the writer is as spellbound by the hero he has created as they are. Conan Doyle was persuaded of this and at last he restored his detective to the public in fiction form. The first episode of the story or novella which he published in 1901 appeared in August. Queues formed outside the Strand magazine's offices and at bookstalls. Its circulation rose overnight by 30,000 copies. Holmes was alive again, or at least another story had been retrieved from Watson's casebook; for Holmes's chroncicler makes it plain that he is not bringing his friend back to life, only recounting a tale which had never found its way into print before. </p> <p>In his introduction to the Penguin Complete Sherlock Holmes, Christopher Morley writes of literature's most famous detective: \"Perhaps no fiction character ever created has become so charmingly real to his readers.\" Holmes, in spite of his absence from his author's pages for so long, had lost none of his charm, energy and intellectual brilliance on his reappearance. We find him, as we always wish to do, at home in 221B Baker Street in conversation with Watson, in this case at breakfast. Holmes is putting his sidekick through a rather patronising test to see if he has assimilated what he calls his \"methods\". Watson is to analyse the character of a doctor who called on the previous day, by studying the walking stick he has inadvertently left behind. This he does about as well as Holmes expects, which is about a quarter as well as he would have done had he studied the famous methods properly. The scene is thus ready for the arrival, soon to take place, of the anxious visitor, desperate to consult the one man in London he knows can solve \"a most serious and extraordinary problem\". This caller turns out to be a doctor of medicine, practising on Dartmoor. </p> <p>Himself a doctor, Conan Doyle was working as a general practitioner in Plymouth at the time, so he was in a position easily to explore the area. Making preparations for the novella based on his friend's ghost story, he went with Fletcher Robinson on a trip to the moor. They stayed at the Duchy Hotel at Princetown and made forays into the surrounding countryside where the author saw bronze age settlements, Fox Tor, the grim prison itself and, of course, those bogs in which it was said any human being or animal straying into them would be fatally sucked down into their murky depths. He soon had material for his story, taking its title from the name of a Baskerville who had married into a local family or, perhaps, from Harry Baskerville, the coachman who had driven Conan Doyle and Robinson's pony and trap about Dartmoor. Whichever it was, the end product became one of the most famous stories ever written.</p> <p>An author who relied to some extent on formula, Conan Doyle often featured in his fiction a protagonist who returned to his homeland after half a lifetime in foreign parts. These exotic countries would most usually be America, India, Australia or South Africa, giving him the opportunity to make his main character a prospector for gold or adventurer in some local war. Some protagonists return to exact revenge on the man or woman who, all those years before, was instrumental in sending them away - a few as blackmailers, others because they have inherited a fortune or a property in England. Such a one is the young Sir Henry Baskerville, who seems to have lived most of his life in America and Canada and, as a result of the deaths of two or three possible heirs, finds himself the owner of Baskerville Hall. His is \"the serious and extraordinary problem\". In spite of being told of his likely fate should he take possession, Sir Henry is determined to \"go to the home of his fathers\", a vast and gloomy pile in the middle of Dartmoor. Conan Doyle is said to have based it on his old school, Stonyhurst, in Lancashire. </p> <p>\"The avenue opened,\" he writes, \"into a broad expanse of turf, and the house lay before us. In the fading light I could see that the centre was a heavy block of a building, from which a porch projected. The whole front was draped in ivy, with a patch clipped here and there where a window or a coat of arms broke through the dark veil. From this central block rose the twin towers, ancient, crenellated and pierced with many loopholes ... A dull light shone through heavy mullioned windows, and from the high chimneys which rose from the steep, high-angled roof there sprang a single black column of smoke.\"</p> <p>Indoors, the dining room \"was a place of shadow and gloom. It was a long chamber with a step separating the dais where the family sat from the lower portion reserved for their dependants. At one end a minstrels' gallery overlooked it. Black beams shot across our heads, with a smoke-darkened ceiling beyond them. With rows of flaring torches to light it up, and the colour and rude hilarity of an old-time banquet, it might have softened: but now, when two black-clothed gentlemen sat in the little circle of light thrown by a shaded lamp, one's voice became hushed and one's spirit subdued ... \"</p> <p>Conan Doyle was an expert in setting a scene in which a drama, fraught with menace and horror, will unfold. But he always knows better than to gild the lily or, in this case, overload his narrative with doom, curses and blood-chilling foreboding, as some of his contemporaries would have done. In no story does he describe the countryside with such affectionate care and sensitivity as in The Hound of the Baskervilles. He writes of \"the red earth new turned by the plough and the broad tangle of the woodlands\", of \"the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood\", from which \"there rose in the distance a grey, melancholy hill, with a strange jagged summit, dim and vague ... like some fantastic landscape in a dream\". Later it is of \"black tors\" that he writes, \"craggy summits\" and \"melancholy downs\".</p> <p>Ever since the prison was built on Dartmoor in the early part of the 19th century, in order to house men taken in the Napoleonic wars, it has been almost a given to write of this beautiful region of Devon as if it were unrelievedly grim. And it is true that the place itself must be one of the most unprepossessing buildings in the west country. But Conan Doyle saw, and made his characters see, the secret loveliness of the moor \"when all was sweet and mellow and peaceful in the golden evening light\", while not neglecting the potential of the prison itself from which escape was so rare, yet the possibility of it such an ever-present threat to the denizens of Dartmoor. He introduced a desperate escaped convict into his story, without whom it could scarcely have been told in the form its author chose for it. He had made good use of his holiday with Robinson. </p> <p>Victorian writers of sensation fiction seem to have enjoyed creating a situation in which spectators or participants suffered from a trauma (though the word was unfamiliar to them) for the rest of their lives as a result of what they had seen. Without overdoing it, Conan Doyle extracts the maximum horror from the scene, told in retrospect, where the \"wild, profane and godless\" Sir Hugo Baskerville is set upon by the hound and slaughtered. Of those who observed it, \"One, it is said, died that very night of what he had seen, and the other twain were but broken men for the rest of their days.\" A curse is henceforward laid upon all future heads of the house of Baskerville. </p> <p>So what did the animal look like? \"A foul thing\", is how he describes it, \"a great black beast, shaped like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal eye has rested upon\". It was \"luminous and ghastly\", having \"dripping jaws\" and \"blazing eyes\". The artist Sidney Paget, who illustrated most of the Sherlock Holmes stories, drew his impression of it for the Strand magazine as it leaps out of its hiding place to savage its victim. Interested readers can see his drawing, magnified to poster size, on the tunnel wall at Baker Street tube station, the Jubilee Line southbound. Conan Doyle's description better fits an Irish wolfhound, but the dog in the picture is surely a German Shepherd.</p> <p>This was the creature destined to plague Baskerville heirs. Needless to say, the intrepid young Sir Henry is not put off by the curse - \"every Baskerville that goes there meets with an evil fate\" - nor by the mysterious death of the previous resident of the hall. And a credible explanation is given for that death. Sir Charles had a bad heart. He died from \"cardiac exhaustion\". Few but his own doctor knew that he had believed in the curse and the doom that overhangs his family. Dr Mortimer himself, on a visit to Sir Charles, has caught a glimpse of what he takes to be a \"large black calf\" and after his sudden death, almost immediately after, comes upon traces around the body.</p> <p>\"Footprints?\" asks Holmes.</p> <p>\"Footprints.\"</p> <p>\"A man's or a woman's?\"</p> <p>Dr Mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant, and his voice sank almost to a whisper as he answered:</p> <p>\"Mr Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound.\" </p> <p>This creature, \"the Baskerville demon\", has been seen by several others. All agreed that it was huge, luminous, ghastly and spectral, and \"could not possibly be any animal known to science\". It has brought about a reign of terror in the district. Even the hardiest refuse to cross the moor at night.</p> <p>Almost from the first it is evident that Holmes does not believe in the possibility of a phantom hound. Some human agency is at work here. He mentions devilry, which prompts Watson to ask him if he favours a supernatural explanation. \"The devil's agents,\" replies Holmes, \"may be of flesh and blood, may they not?\" In none of his Holmes stories are ghosts or spirits or demons allowed to intervene, and while this may seem exactly what we should expect from a writer of relatively modern fiction, Conan Doyle himself was not sceptical about paranormal phenomena. He attended spiritualist meetings and s\u00e9ances, and in later life took photographs of beings he believed to be fairies. But they never intruded into his detective fiction. Perhaps he was so deeply subsumed into the character of his most famous creation that when writing of him he was unable to do otherwise than believe in what Holmes believed in or express any convictions alien to Holmes's own.</p> <p>Hound or no hound, when Sir Henry Baskerville takes up his inheritance and goes down to Baskerville Hall, it is Holmes he would have accompany him. However, the detective is otherwise occupied at home. Or so he says. We who are familiar with the stories and Conan Doyle's techniques guess that he has other plans, that he probably intends to follow in disguise and keep his eye on the incumbent of the hall from nearby. He will not go himself, he tells Baskerville, but he will send his faithful assistant. \"There is no man who is better worth having at your side when you are in a tight place.\" Watson is willing enough, for the promise of adventure is always an attraction to him.</p> <p>Living at the gloomy hall, they will encounter those people Holmes has enumerated as suspects and those he considers \"entirely honest\", Dr Mortimer and his wife among the latter and a clutch of neighbours, local farmers and servants, any of whom may be guilty. Watson is recommended to take his gun with him. \"Keep your revolver near you night and day and never relax your precautions.\" This will be nothing unusual for the doctor. In many, if not all, of the Holmes stories, he takes care to be armed and will draw without hesitation if necessary. The fiction was written at a time, both innocent and sophisticated, when possessing firearms was almost indispensable in a gentleman. Holmes and Watson sometimes put an end to adversaries' lives, but no action ever seems to be taken against them. Perhaps these killings were regarded as judicial executions. In earlier stories Inspector Lestrade and his henchmen distrust Holmes's methods but later on the police show a respect for him just this side of idolatry. </p> <p>Yet those were the days when the British were famous for not arming their policemen. Today police officers bear arms in many situations and the machine-guns they carry pass almost unnoticed, while for a member of the public to possess even a 12-bore shotgun requires a licence, separate storage for the weapon from its ammunition, police inspections and other involved procedures. Watson quite casually carries his pistol in his pocket, as does Holmes his revolver, and it is as well they do in this case, so that side by side in a tight corner as they so often are, they can deal death to this creature which is \"as large as a small lioness\". And see too that justice is meted out to the human perpetrators. </p> <p>The outcome is no great surprise to the astute reader. But, as in all good mystery stories, this is unimportant. It is the characters that count, the sinister setting and the enduring marvel of Holmes's deductive powers. That his \"methods\" often fail to stand up - the preponderance of footprints as an immediate clue to identification, for instance - does nothing to lessen the entertainment they bring the reader. It is the same with his ability to detect the profession, marital status, domicile and much of the life history of a stranger come to seek his help before the newcomer even opens his or her mouth. He does it from the appearance of a shoe, the stain on a coat sleeve, a pair of spectacles. Often, some quite other and just as convincing interpretation might be placed on these clues - Watson has probably suggested it already - but we accept Holmes's analysis, for one of Conan Doyle's achievements is that we trust him. We trust this invented detective that many people to this day believe really existed, as much as we trust the words and opinions of experts writing in the newspapers. </p> <p>With The Hound of the Baskervilles, Conan Doyle brought Holmes back - in a manner of speaking. The explanation that this was a memoir of his friend that Watson was writing, not an account of a recent adventure, was inadequate for Holmes's millions of fans. The detective had to be resurrected and restored to his public, so Conan Doyle artfully contrived an outcome for the Reichenbach Falls encounter different from that which Watson and his public had been led to believe. When in Moriarty's clutches Holmes used his knowledge of baritsu, \"the Japanese system of wrestling, which has more than once been very useful to me\", and threw the professor into the abyss. His author brought him back for the collection called The Return of Sherlock Holmes and, later, for His Last Bow with a preface by Dr John H Watson MD: \"The friends of Mr Sherlock Holmes will be glad to learn that he is still alive and well, though somewhat crippled by occasional attacks of rheumatism ...\"</p> <p>Disabling illness sits uneasily with the vigorous athlete and intellectual giant we knew, but perhaps he had overdone the baritsu in earlier days. A remarkable aspect of these stories is that, though some are superior to others, none is very inferior and, above all, there is no noticeable decline in their quality as their author grew tired of his creation. The Hound of the Baskervilles is one of the best of them and a good introduction to the world's most famous detective.</p>",
  "<p>The Gorgeous Georgians have always appealed in lean times. During the depression years of the 1920s and 30s, there was a Georgian revival in furniture and interior decorating. Jane Austen novels were especially popular during the second world war, offering an escape to gentler certainties while the bombs rained down on the Anderson shelters. </p> <p>TH White's The Age of Scandal (1950) was written as a diversion from the dreariness of Attlee's first Labour government. \"I have been consoling my old age by running away from the Bondfields and the Shinwells and the Bevans, and by going back to the grand old days of Horace Walpole.\" It was a Tory requiem: \"one last, loving and living picture of an aristocratic civilisation which we shall never see again\". So adieu to wit and chandeliers, and hello inheritance tax. </p> <p>But progressives have found their colourful reflection in the era, too. Tony Richardson's film Tom Jones (1963) is a good-natured comic romp around an altogether different 18th century - a free and easy world of inns and barns, willing wenches and robust appetites. The Georgians here represent honest bawdiness before those po-faced and prudish Victorians masked earthiness with hypocrisy.</p> <p>Historians raised in the good times of 1960s prosperity were fascinated by an era that brought the Enlightenment and Britain's emergence as the world's leading economic power - though they were more interested in radicalism and riots than in balls and belles. The late, great Roy Porter charted the impact of Enlightenment ideas on sexual mores with unmistakable gusto. \"The libido was liberated and erotic gratification increasingly dissociated from sin and shame.\" Or, as the politician and pornographer John Wilkes put it: </p> <p>Life can little else supply <br>But a few good fucks and then we die.</p> <p>For Porter and his swinging generation of professors, the 18th century was \"a tonic time to be alive\". Perhaps it was, if you were a man.</p> <p>Women's history was in full swing in the academy by the time Stella Tillyard produced Aristocrats (1994), her study of the clever, complex Lennox sisters, and Amanda Foreman her biography of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire (1998). The bestselling appeal of these books lay in their dramatic narratives and evocation of milieu, like Gainsborough portraits brought to life, but both were informed by feminism. Nobility was far from modish as a subject of scholarly research, but both books recreated the Hanoverian elite from within, dramatising the tension between freedom and reputation, risk and retribution, for even the most privileged women. </p> <p>Now, with Saul Dibb's heavily marketed The Duchess, based on Foreman's book, the Palladian houses are thrown open, the pastel silks come rustling forth, and the aristocratic minuet is begun again.</p> <p>The film opens with the briskly arranged marriage of 17-year-old Lady Georgiana Spencer (the immaculate Keira Knightley) to the resplendently rich Duke of Devonshire (a dour and perplexed Ralph Fiennes), master of Chatsworth, Hardwick, Londesborough and Bolton Abbey, Lismore Castle, Chiswick House, Burlington House and Devonshire House, who is after an heir of the blood. Several daughters and miscarriages later, the Duke believes his fashion-plate Duchess has failed in her sole purpose, and he solaces himself by adopting his wife's companion, Lady Elizabeth Foster (the enigmatic and sexy Hayley Atwell), as live-in mistress. </p> <p>Belatedly providing the requisite heir, the fruit of a gruelling marital rape, Georgiana falls into the arms of rising Whig politician Charles Grey (a schoolboyish Dominic Cooper). However, the threat of never seeing her brood again drives Georgiana back to the Duke. Pregnant with Grey's child, she is forced into seclusion and must give up the infant at birth, even though she has generously raised one of the Duke's bastards in her own nursery. As a study of the crushing power of patriarchy and the remorseless operation of the sexual double standard, the film cannot be faulted. </p> <p>The Georgians routinely indulged behaviour in men that would be repugnant in women. Elite girls were expected to be innocent virgins on their wedding day to men of the world who had already practised on married women abroad, servant girls, the odd actress and prostitutes. A husband had a right to demand sexual servicing and there was no such crime as marital rape. Men's diaries are casual in reporting sex with vulnerable maidservants. Women were drilled to turn a blind eye to men's peccadilloes and indiscretions, whereas an iron chastity was expected of them. Forgiveness on the part of a wife was a sine qua non, but an equivalent forgiveness on the part of a husband was believed degrading and dishonourable.</p> <p>The sexual double standard flew in the face of Christian dogma, and commentators recognised the injustice of it, but they cited the excuse of pregnancy, and the risk of intruding bastards into the bloodline and inheritance. As Dr Johnson concluded, \"all the property of the world depends\" upon female chastity. </p> <p>A deeper instinct seems often at work too. Some men wanted to dominate absolutely what they felt they owned in common law, and could be enraged by any encroachments on their turf. Meanwhile they could be predatory themselves, showing scant sympathy for their victims, especially those of lower rank. As the elder Lord Sandwich put it: \"He that doth get a wench with child and marries her afterwards is as if a man should shit in his hat and then clap it on his head.\"</p> <p>A visceral misogyny was a deep-rooted feature of aristocratic society. The only incongruity is that the screen Georgiana should be so astounded to discover the selfishness of the male prerogative.</p> <p>So far, so orthodox in its feminism. If The Duchess doesn't make schoolgirls dream of careers in family law, then nothing will. Where the film fails its female audience and departs from recent scholarship is in the depiction of a woman who is so comprehensively a victim. Knightley's \"G\" is an innocent butterfly broken on the wheel of patriarchy. </p> <p>We are told that Georgiana is highly educated and fluent in several languages, but there is no sense that she has an intellectual hinterland. Her breastfeeding is presented as an expression of her natural warmth in contrast to her constipated husband, who shows tenderness only to little boys or his dogs. In fact, aristocratic women were inspired by their reading of Jean-Jacques Rousseau to dispense with wet nurses, and Georgiana herself helped reinforce the fashion. She was not just indulging a physical instinct, but flourishing her Enlightenment affinities and radical chic. </p> <p>Georgiana's Whiggery is presented as mere froth, a side effect of her attachments to men - though it is equally hard to imagine Dominic Cooper's lightweight Grey as a fiery 1790s radical, brilliant parliamentary orator and future prime minister who, in raffish old age, would pass the Great Reform Act of 1832. </p> <p>Knightley has barely a walk-on part in the contested Westminster election of 1784 - in reality the most notorious public episode of the Duchess's well-publicised life. Canvassing the streets for the Whig candidate, Charles James Fox, a man who was not even a relative, in a constituency that was not a family borough, the Duchess brought a torrent of abuse on herself. Obscene cartoons depicted her as Fox's lover, with a cuckolded Duke left holding the baby, or showed her exchanging kisses for votes, allowing gross liberties to the plebeian electors. Satirists attacked the front on which every woman was vulnerable - her sexual reputation. Nevertheless, Georgiana's family pressed her to continue the campaign. They criticised her for the absurd affectation of breastfeeding a daughter, not for street politics. </p> <p>The film's onset historical adviser, Hannah Greig of the University of York, is rueful but resigned to the focus on the bedroom. \"It is the Duchess's interior world, not her political role, which lies at the heart of this interpretation. Historians might wish that her politics had a greater airing; however, we should acknowledge the challenges of setting a film in the 18th century. There is just not the same level of general knowledge of Georgian history (it is not on the national curriculum) as there is of the first world war or the Nazis.\" Nevertheless, without the politics, Georgiana's life is a depressing study in defeat.</p> <p>The script acclaims the Duchess as \"the empress of fashion herself\", a trendsetter par excellence - \"what she wears tonight the world wears tomorrow\" - yet still contrives to see clothes as pathetic tinsel, gilded compensation for the lack of political rights. \"You have so many ways to express yourself,\" the Duchess tells the Duke, \"but we have only hats.\" </p> <p>However, if aristocratic consumerism had been so trifling, then leading manufacturers would not have fallen over themselves to secure female patronage. Great ladies were the \"legislators in taste\", believed Josiah Wedgwood; his marketing strategy and pottery empire were built on the conviction that where ladies led, the middle ranks would enthusiastically follow. </p> <p>The Duchess of Devonshire achieved a titanic celebrity in her own time. The Morning Herald and Daily Advertiser alone was publishing at least one story a week about her from 1781. Knightley's \"G\" seeks the adulation of the crowd to compensate for inner emptiness, like a prototype Marilyn Monroe or Judy Garland. In fact, the performance of fashion was an exercise in power for noble men and women alike - asserting the supreme status of the beau monde in diamonds, plate, carriages, dinners, servants and manners - and party politics. The public celebrity, libertine flamboyance and female exhibitionism cultivated by the leading Whig families were crafted to define the Prince of Wales's party in defiance of the \"Farmer George\" probity associated with his father, the King.</p> <p>Documentary realism is not essential to capturing the essence of the past on film. Fellini's Casanova (1976) is highly stylised, episodic and strange. Ribbons of black plastic represent the sea. But in the slow and stately lowering of the huge chandeliers, and Casanova's careful philosophical preparations for an orgy, the peculiarities of the courts of the European Enlightenment are indelibly captured. </p> <p>The most theatrical moments in The Duchess are often truest to period. \"The scissors!\" demands the flinty Duke on their wedding night, before he snips his bride out of the finery into which she had been sewn for the day. In a scene straight out of a contemporary cartoon, the Duchess staggers sozzled into the candles at an assembly and her starchy wig catches fire. The Duchess wears white stockings and pink garters in bed, as in Georgian erotica. The Duke cares not a whit whether a servant hears him having noisy sex or threatening his wife with exile. The deft touches suggest the knowledge of Greig, an expert on aristocratic society. </p> <p>Ingenious use is made throughout of the great Whig colours, the blue and the buff. The silks are tinted like Gloire de Dijon roses, while the servants' liveries are wittily matched to the woodwork.</p> <p>Underneath the set-dressing, however, the characterisation and script pulse with modern cod psychology. Only Fiennes manages a three-dimensional portrait of a mindset far removed from our own. Cooing to his pointers or complaining of \"funny mutton\", Fiennes shows a sly wit, and in his sorrowful exasperation transforms a lack of imagination into something approaching a tragic flaw. His performance leaves the choice impression that patriarchal power is complacent, supremely stolid and even a little dim. He languidly saunters away with the film, which might better be entitled The Duke</p> <p>The Duchess is custom-built to show that under the corsets beats the heart of a very modern girl who needs a bit of love and understanding - for as the film's poster trumpets, \"there were three people in the marriage\".</p> <p>\"That modern drama has overshadowed the historical context should perhaps be a call to arms for historians,\" reflects Greig. \"Surely historical narratives can capture an audience without this kind of marketing?\" Clearly, the script writers believe not. Instead we discover the Georgians are JUST LIKE US, but in gorgeous fancy dress.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Duchess (12A) is on general release.</p>",
  "<p>I came across Ellen when I was writing about Shaw,\" explains Michael Holroyd, setting out the genesis of his new group biography of the remarkable theatrical families of Ellen Terry and Henry Irving, A Strange Eventful History. \"I really didn't want to do another book of the magnitude of the Shaw, but she was interesting and I like writing about women, so I found myself jotting down a few notes about Ellen.\" Holroyd then abruptly stops himself. \"See how I fell into the first name thing? It's absolutely wrong. You must never call your subject by their first name. Never. Academics don't like it at all. So anyway, as I was saying,\" he continues with a barely concealed smile, \"it was impossible to write about Ellen without Irving elbowing his way in and trying to upstage her - and once that happened the rest of the families crowded in and I was in for the long haul.\"</p> <p>Holroyd's wry insistence on informality is not just to irritate academic biographers, it is indicative of a more ambitious and, although he probably wouldn't admit it, more serious literary programme. Before Holroyd's ground-breaking biography of the Bloomsbury writer Lytton Strachey in 1967, the default form was still based on the stately and portentous Victorian model. Of course there had been examples of waspishness, wit and even scandal, but it was Holroyd who first successfully combined rigorous scholarship, wide-ranging research and astute interpretation while also humanising the form through elegant narrative and emotional cognisance.</p> <p>The biographer Fiona MacCarthy said the publication of Lytton Strachey \"changed almost the whole biography scene ... After Holroyd, new things mattered: the pursuit of the whole person, families and friendships, hidden motivations, secret compulsions and sex, particularly sex.\"</p> <p>Holroyd's matter-of-fact acceptance of the full spectrum of sexuality attracted most attention, with a key scene being Strachey noticing a stain on Virginia Woolf's dress. \"Semen?\" he asked. It is difficult now to comprehend just what a breakthrough this represented but, of all people, Kenneth Williams in a 1969 diary entry gives some inkling. He recorded how he wept on finishing the book for \"this strange, gentle, unhappy and wonderfully civilised man who was so unable to find complete and shared love, and who was, at the end, surrounded by love. I think there are things in this book which have affected me deeply and I think that Holroyd himself has clarified (what were for me) some strange inconsistencies and worries in my own life.\"</p> <p>Holroyd says he's always liked what \"Dr Johnson called the 'significance of the trivial'. These are the things that make a book human.\" After Strachey he brought the same approach to monumental multi-volume biographies of the artist Augustus John (1974 and 1975) and George Bernard Shaw (1988-92). \"I like extraordinary characters. I like irregularity, extreme things happening. Even if they're not about celebrated people, perhaps especially if they're not celebrated people. \"</p> <p>Having dipped into the lives of Terry and Irving, Holroyd suspected there would be an interesting cast of characters around them, \"but it really was a Pandora's box. People changing gender, attempted suicides, attempted murders, drownings. A sensational novelist wouldn't include quite so much plot. But I did have an instinct that what people do on the stage affects their life off the stage. Follow them home after they have played melodrama and you'll find more melodrama.\" He says he has a theory that \"families don't really change that much. What is reported in the papers has changed, but the dynamics remain pretty constant.\" So despite the exotic structures of the Terry and Irving clans - for example Edward Gordon Craig, Terry's son, fathered 13 children with eight different women, including Chekhov's widow, and her daughter Edith was a militant lesbian - Holroyd has attempted to view them, more or less, as a unit \"that takes in all the divorces and affairs and the rest of the comings and goings. I might have a personal reason for this. I was an only child and my parents divorced and kept remarrying, and so I'd have these step-parents, but only for short periods of time. In a play of my life they'd only have a few lines. But of course they had lives outside of my experience, and while I couldn't follow these people in my life, I do follow the people in Terry and Irving's. It might be nothing, but I do wonder whether doing that has provided an extra satisfaction for me.\"</p> <p>Holroyd was born in London in 1935 and, after the divorce of his businessman father, Basil, and Swedish mother, Ulla, he was largely brought up by his paternal grandparents - whose own marriage was at times \"venomous\" - in Maidenhead. It was a \"quite solitary and spectacularly uneventful childhood. Apart from bits and pieces of the war.\" There had once been a family fortune based on his great-grandfather's Indian tea plantations, and although it had been dissipated over the generations, Holroyd was still sent to Eton where he says he \"didn't particularly distinguish myself\" but was nevertheless a national champion squash player.</p> <p>He says that when he left school he was \"a bit rudderless\" and his father, \"who was very keen that, unlike him, I shouldn't become bankrupt\", attempted to persuade him into studying science at university. \"But I was badly cast for science and didn't really know much about university beyond it being more schooling and I'd had enough schooling. So I refused, like a horse at a fence.\" His father then reasoned that if Michael could argue so stubbornly, he could become a lawyer. \"But that didn't help the finances either because in those Dickensian days, becoming an articled clerk meant you paid them, not them paying you.\" Next came National Service and a commission in the Green Jackets, followed soon after by a transfer to the Royal Fusiliers \"at the request of the Green Jackets\". His military career also included being, briefly, locked up in the Tower of London for \"missing a war\" (Suez) when the telegram asking him to report to embarkation went astray. </p> <p>Holroyd says he found the army \"bewildering\" and by his mid 20s had begun to undertake some Grub Street literary journalism with a notion of becoming a writer. His family didn't rule out the idea and put forward two career paths. His father suggested he should become a regular in the army, go out to India and the family tea plantations and then, \"maybe when I was 65, I could retire with a pension and begin to write\". His grandparents offered him a small amount of money to live on while he wrote a book. \"And if it got published that was fine, but if not I would have to come to my senses.\"</p> <p>He opted for his grandparents' strategy and began his book about the biographer Hugh Kingsmill, whom he had discovered at the Maidenhead public library, an institution he describes as \"my university\". \"I went there first in my early teens and it was a warm, welcoming place full of these authors in alphabetical order.\" He read Dostoevsky, Zola and Balzac when \"quite young, and the great thing was that no professor was picking them for me. That's how I came across Kingsmill, a biographer, who had edited this huge anthology of his favourite passages from English literature called The High Hill of the Muses. He wrote a long introduction that came from a lifetime of reading and the book became like a compass pointing me towards Wordsworth and Blake and everything else.\"</p> <p>The publisher Martin Secker, just before his retirement, took on the book - \"some people later told me that he was going blind by then. But I quite liked sniping comments like that. It showed you were getting on in the literary world\" - and it was published to warm reviews. When he started on Strachey he says his \"ignorance was a strength in that I didn't know I was doing something you shouldn't. I just followed what was interesting in the material. My main themes have always been the subject's work, death is usually in there and so is love. I found myself thinking more about these people's lives than my own and probably one or two people were disappointed in me.\"</p> <p>In the 60s and early 70s Holroyd lived with the talented but tormented writer Philippa Pullar and has written movingly and candidly about their difficult relationship in Mosaic (2004), the second volume of his autobiographical sketches. He has been married to the novelist Margaret Drabble since 1982 and they are one of the best-connected couples on the London literary scene, as well as Holroyd being the literary committee man par excellence. But when he began his Strachey research in the mid 60s, Holroyd didn't know any of the Bloomsbury group personally, although many were still alive. </p> <p>Leonard Woolf, for one, was not initially inclined to help him, but he eventually relented and even, cautiously, reviewed the 1967 first volume, complaining that Holroyd had placed too much emphasis on Strachey's love life. But by the time of the second volume the following year, Woolf was more impressed, praising Holroyd for \"bringing Lytton to life, his strange character, his wit and brilliance - and what was even more difficult - he brings to life the galaxy of strange men and women who for 15 years circled round Lytton\". </p> <p>Holroyd says he didn't realise \"how brave some of them were to have scandalous things - homosexuality had only just been legalised - written about them\". He showed all the relevant passages to his sources and obtained their written approval for publication. \"Some were easier than others. The most poignant was a man who asked me whether I thought he'd still be allowed into Lord's cricket ground.\" After publication Holroyd remembers receiving \"terrible homophobic letters from people saying I was promoting something that would cause cancer and things like that. Thank goodness times have changed. But you have to remember that people simply didn't know that Maynard Keynes was homosexual. \"</p> <p>At the same time as Holroyd was exposing other people's lives to the public gaze, he was doing something similar to his own in an autobiographical novel, A Dog's Life. When he showed the manuscript to his mother she declared it \"a hoot\". His father, however, \"was deeply hurt. The worst thing I did was to mock his driving skills, but he said if it was published I'd have a court case on my hands\". Holroyd withdrew the book in the UK but agreed to publication in America. As his father was always short of money he passed on part of his advance without revealing the source. \"But he found out and insisted on paying me back. In a manner of speaking. He gave me his Indian tea estate share certificates and so from then on I would get a report once a year from India saying why they couldn't pay a dividend. You know, political revolt, swarms of gigantic caterpillars ... \"</p> <p>By now a pattern had been set of a minor character in one book becoming the primary subject of the next. Strachey \"caught my attention\" in the background of the Kingsmill book. Augustus John's bohemia abutted Bloomsbury. John in turn painted portraits of Shaw who was in the same theatrical world as Ellen Terry.</p> <p>He describes Shaw as \"an Everest. He lived into his 90s and he thought a writer's business was to mind everybody else's business. It might have taken me 15 years to research it, but my argument is that it took him 95 years to live it.\" The writing of the Shaw biography became a news story in itself, with much interest in the size of his advance and disputes within the tiny world of Shaw studies. The publication of the books symbolised the boom in literary biography that he himself had begun with Strachey. \"There have been 40 years of very exciting times with very good people in the field,\" he says. \"The bar has been raised. But it has changed a little now.\" Looking at the explosion of \"life writing\" in universities, he says he wished people didn't make such a hard-and-fast distinction between fiction and non-fiction. \"I prefer creative and re-creative writing. You can't make anything up, but you have to try and recreate it.\"</p> <p>And he is sceptical of a trend that \"takes a single life, maybe not a famous life, but one representative of a section of society, possibly a victimised section of society. And you use that person to tell a social history. It is perfectly valid, but perhaps belongs more to history than biography.\" But what hasn't changed is the level of commitment needed to produce a good book. He says he never intended his study of Shaw to go on so long but equally knew he couldn't cut corners to make it any quicker. He was daunted by the ever-increasing scale of the Terry book, especially as he had surgery for bowel cancer while writing it. </p> <p>\"But it's always the same. You're longing to finish, but when you get to the end there is a sort of grief. And that should be the case if you have written a living book. You're always two people when doing these things. Starting off you're both researcher and writer, constantly second-guessing yourself as to what's useful. Then you become the confidant of the subject - you really do become intimate with them - as well as the cold-eyed biografiend.\" </p> <p>He remembers going to a literary festival in America not long after publication of the Shaw at which the theme was \"birth and death\". \"I was with Maggie, so we tossed a coin and I got death. I read a piece about Shaw on the brink of dying but having such a strong constitution that he was hanging on. Shaw says to the nurse, 'I wish I could die now', and his housekeeper, who had been with him for many years, heard him and rushed into the bedroom and wailed 'I wish it was I who was dying, not you Mr Shaw'. And suddenly I choked up and could hardly read. It took me 20 seconds or so to pull myself together and finish the passage. Those words really were both rather wonderful and terrible, and that was my grief coming out. But I immediately had two thoughts. The first was that, as an intimate of Shaw, I knew how much he would have despised such sentimentality. The second was as a storyteller - I knew it must have made for a really rather affecting performance.\"</p> <h2>Holroyd on Holroyd</h2> <p>\"DNL had been brought up in a conventional family where divorce was regarded with horror. And that was why, as Craig explained, he could not marry her. Not only had he been married but he was also divorced: and he regarded the process with the same contaminating horror as her parents did. So there was no alternative for them both but free love. This was unfamiliar territory for such a politely tutored girl. Still, she recognised Craig's boldness in this enterprise and was determined to match it with what she described as 'the immensely protective caution which even young and inexperienced women manifest regarding anyone to whom they are attached'. She was bound by something stronger than an attachment. 'I loved him passionately, whole-heartedly,' she was to tell Craig's son Edward many years later. 'I only wish he had not had quite so much devotion from so many.'\"</p> <p>When writing a big book it's no good standing back and presenting an uninterrupted panorama. You have to come in quite close every now and again. I like to insert these portraits in miniature of minor characters. The best way to introduce them and make them live is through comedy, although in Dorothy Neville Lees's case the tone is ultimately more tragic. And they must tell you something quickly about one of the leading characters. DNL represents quite a lot of Edward Gordon Craig's relationships with women. So you come in, get this intense close-up, and then you can go back out and return to the main story.</p>",

The government restored \u00a334m a year and this week's plan will now see each of the big six energy companies contribute an extra \u00a350m a year to fund home improvements. </p> <p>The package's key points are:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> If you are 70 or over, earn less than \u00a315,460, and receive one of a number of benefits, your power company will pay for cavity wall and loft insulation. Contact your power firm to confirm your eligibility.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> For the first time the power firms will be \"encouraged\" to top up existing loft insulation for the most vulnerable, although this is not mandatory. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The power firm will also offer to pay 50% of the cost of loft and cavity wall insulation for all other households regardless of income. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> On top of the help offered directly by the power firms, Warm Front is still offering grants to help the over 70s and to those on benefits of up to \u00a32,700 to install a new central heating boiler.

  "<h2>Cold callers raise the temperature</h2> <p>Like Patrick Collinson (On reflection, September 6) I have been asked for personal information by telephone cold callers.</p> <p>I was called by HM Revenue &amp; Customs so they could check highly sensitive information they held on me, but first I had to reveal private information to a complete stranger so she could be sure who I was! When I told her I did not deal with unsolicited callers she declared she was not an unsolicited caller - she was from Child Tax Credits! (?) I was given the impression she found me obstructive and could not supply a number for me to call back on. </p> <p>More distressingly, in December last year, I was called on my new pay-as-you-go mobile by a man from Orange who demanded private security information. When I refused, explaining quite reasonably why, he threatened to bar my phone if I would not comply with his request. I would not so he hung up on me mid-sentence and he had indeed blocked all my phone services. I managed to get it unblocked but apparently my file had been marked that I had been aggressive! </p> <p>The common thing between these callers was their absolute confidence in their right to demand private information and the fact that it had not occurred to them that this would be inappropriate, which suggests that other people quite happily tell them anything.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p>I got a similar call myself months ago, apparently from my bank. I was so angry that someone was ringing me and had the nerve to ask me to confirm my details without telling me who they were. I asked to speak to the manager, and tried to reason with him that it should be his staff who should be convincing me who they were before asking for my details. He agreed and apologised, saying more training would be provided for staff. What struck me most was that the staff member was taken aback when I asked who he was and where he was calling from!<br><strong>Kunle Ogunjobi,</strong> London</p> <h2>Local income tax is a fairer solution</h2> <p>Patrick Collinson's rant against local income tax (On reflection, September 6) is based on a flawed logic. That the single pensioner is living in a nice, mortgage-free house is no indication whatsoever of cash wealth. It is probable they have led a fairly frugal lifestyle, working, saving and managing their affairs efficiently so that they could retire in relative comfort without being a drain on the state. The \"struggling\" family next door have probably led a more profligate lifestyle, taken on debts that they could not afford to repay, produced children they could not afford to raise and are unlikely to be short of the supposed material \"essentials\" of modern living. One also has to consider the family of four will be using far more council-provided amenities/services than the single person. A tax just based on property values is totally inappropriate. Let us pay for what we use. <br><strong>Sue Rowe,</strong> via email</p> <p>Didn't it occur to Patrick Collinson that the single pensioner with a paid-off mortgage and \"some decent savings\" has also been one of two parents bringing up a family while struggling to pay off a massive mortgage, and at a time when interest rates touched a hefty 15%? Or that the childless single person has never troubled the education service (the schools budget accounts for the lion's share of council tax)? </p> <p>There are more single-occupant households today than ever before. All of them pay more than their fair share of council tax. Two, three or more wage-earners in a household pay just one whack of council tax, and that is where the unfairness lies. Nor is local income tax as complicated as Collinson claims; much of Europe uses it with no problems and with far better local services.<br><strong>Mike Whitley,</strong> Petham, Kent</p> <p>Patrick Collinson seems not to realise that pensioners might actually enjoy living in houses rather than flats. If you have a house and a modest income, the garden (and the creatures in it) may be your greatest pleasure. The wealthiest pensioners would simply pay any property tax increases and stay on, so the poorest would be hit disproportionately. Families with two children and a huge mortgage have chosen both of those things. Don't force pensioners to \"release\" their property for the families' benefit! Why not have fewer children and smaller properties in the first place?<br><strong>Jayne Lee Wilson,</strong> Liverpool</p> <p>Local income tax would be a gift to the tax avoiders/evaders and those in the cash-in-hand/black economy enabling them to contribute even less to society. A property tax is difficult to evade. Council tax bands should be abolished and all properties revalued at their true current price with no upper limit and index-linked. When a property is sold, solicitors would be required to certify the true price, which would become the new valuation. <br><strong>Patrick Ford,</strong> Carshalton, Surrey</p> <p>I live in an expensive area of London - West Hampstead. I don't want to leave the area and I can hardly downsize from a two-bedroom flat containing a lifetime of possessions, especially as one bedroom is my office. I earn an average annual income (as a freelance journalist) and am by no means wealthy. To me, local income tax is the most equitable way of raising local taxes and I don't see why it needs to be done by employers; can't it be handled with the annual tax return? </p> <p>Yes, I reach pensionable age this year; no, I cannot afford to retire; and no, I have no intention of moving. Isn't an Englishman's (or woman's) home their castle? <br><strong>Marcia MacLeod,</strong> London</p> <h2>Why should we help buy-to-let investors?</h2> <p>Guardian Money has regularly highlighted how the buy-to-let market has been partly responsible for soaring house prices, which have put home ownership out of the reach of most first-time buyers. Large capital gains profits have been made even larger by tax breaks, paid for by the rest of us, and some banks now find themselves in a particularly vulnerable position due to massive buy-to-let lending.</p> <p>I find it staggering that the new stamp duty exemption on properties up to \u00a3175,000 for a year does not exclude those bought for buy-to-let. This will surely now give an additional incentive for cash-rich investors, who can afford to wait for an upturn, to buy up many of the smaller properties which first-time buyers would aim for. Why should the majority of taxpayers have to subsidise buy-to-let investors with the still-existing tax breaks and now a gift of up to \u00a31,750 per property? Not so surprising perhaps, from the people who gave us the abolition of the 10% income tax rate, UK as a tax haven for billionaires and the billions/trillions spent on the Iraq war.

  "<p>A British soldier killed in a firefight with the Taliban yesterday was the third to die in Afghanistan this month. </p> <p>The soldier, from the 2nd Battalion the Parachute Regiment died in clashes with Taliban forces in Helmand province, the Ministry of Defence said last night. </p> <p>He was on a routine patrol yesterday morning when he was shot in the head during a gun battle. Next of kin have been informed.</p> <p>The death comes 48 hours after a decorated British war hero was killed as he tried to disarm a Taliban bomb. He was named yesterday as Warrant Officer Class 2 Gary O'Donnell, 40, of the Royal Logistic Corps. He died as he approached the device near Musa Qala in Helmand province.</p> <p>Recent months have been some of the bloodiest since coalition forces were sent to the country in 2001, and the latest death takes the number of British service personnel killed to 119.</p> <p>Task Force Helmand spokesman Lieutenant Colonel David Reynolds said of yesterday's death: \"Until you have experienced the death of a family member, it is hard to absorb the pain that this soldier's family, friends and comrades feel. His family are in the thoughts of</p> <p>everyone in Task Force Helmand and hopefully that will bring some comfort to them.\" </p> <p>Warrant Officer O'Donnell, a bomb disposal expert, from Edinburgh, was awarded the George Medal last year for the courage he displayed in Iraq in 2006. He was also hailed as a hero for his work in Afghanistan, including one operation over the summer during which he defused eight booby traps in one day.</p> <p>His commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Dave Wilson, paid tribute to an \"amazing\" man who was \"hugely talented and unbelievably brave\".</p> <p>O'Donnell, who saw his newborn son while on leave in the UK a few weeks ago, leaves behind three other children - Aiden, eight, and two teenagers from a previous marriage, Dylan, 16, and Kayleigh, 14. His widow, Toni, said: \"Gary was living the dream and we are all very proud of who he was, and he will be missed greatly.\"</p> <p>The soldier died while leading a small team sent in to neutralise an improvised explosive device found by a Royal Engineers search team to clear a route for 5 Scots Battlegroup.</p> <p>Wilson said: \"He was at the very top of his extremely dangerous and difficult trade. It was his passion and he took immense pride in making places safer for other people. The danger to his own life rarely seemed to affect him.\"</p> <p>In June, O'Donnell had to jam his fingers into a wooden clothes peg being used as a bomb trigger to stop the device detonating. In an interview he spoke of the need to \"keep a clear head and trust your own judgment\".</p> <p>O'Donnell was awarded the George Medal for two particular incidents in Basra, the second of which involved him spending four hours in a protective suit in boiling temperatures deactivating a bomb made of 23 large explosive charges.</p>",
  "<p>Georgia's attack on the breakaway region of South Ossetia was unnecessary and unprovoked and was encouraged by the United States, Russia's president, Dmitry Medvedev, said in an interview yesterday.</p> <p>\"For Russia, August 8 was like September 11 for the United States,\" he told a group of foreign journalists and academics. \"I would like to see major lessons from it for the world.\"</p> <p>He made clear that the lessons, as Russia sees them, are that the post-cold war \"illusion\" that a world with one super power is a safe and predictable place is now over.</p> <p>The 42-year-old president said George Bush had phoned him shortly after he had ordered Russian forces to drive the Georgians back. \"'You're a young president with a liberal background. Why do you need this?' Medvedev quoted Bush as saying. \"I told him we had no choice,\" he said. </p> <p>The Russian president's interview followed a day after a similar interview with the prime minister, Vladimir Putin. He seemed to be talking from the same script, though there were important differences between the two. The president was more blunt about his Georgian counterpart, Mikheil Saakashvili, calling him \"burdened with a host of pathologies\" and alleging he often appeared in public under the influence of drugs. </p> <p>\"Russia had to recognise South Ossetia as an independent state - a move widely criticised in the west - because otherwise Georgia might attack again. </p> <p>\"If he takes this blood once he would try again if he was not muzzled,\" he said. </p> <p>Medvedev accused the US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, of blocking a tentative deal made between Russia and Georgia to sign an agreement on the use of force. \"Rice met him and the boy changed miraculously afterwards. He started to postpone the agreement. He started preparations for war.\"</p> <p>The Russian president rejected Georgia's argument that if Nato had given it a membership action plan, as Bush wanted to do earlier this year (the move was blocked by France and Germany), Russia would not have dared to use force. \"I can assure you that as president I would not have wavered for a second to make the same decisions that I made back then,\" he said. </p> <p>He was firmer than Putin in disowning any parallels between today's Russia and the Soviet Union. Putin once described the Soviet collapse as the greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century. Medvedev, 13 years younger than his predecessor, said he felt no nostalgia. </p> <p>\"I don't want to live in a militarised country behind an iron curtain. It's boring. Been there and seen the movie. I've done that,\" he said. He took a more optimistic position on the effects of the crisis on Russia's relations with the US and the EU. \"I don't think this phase of confrontation will be lengthy,\" he asserted. </p> <p>Both men made it clear that Russia was not planning to take South Ossetia into the Russian Federation. Eduard Kokoity, the region's president, said on Thursday that he wanted his republic to join Russia now that it had declared independence from Georgia. Within an hour he had come under pressure to change his position, telling the Russian news agency Interfax that he had been \"misunderstood\". </p> <p>Nato is to review its relationship with the Georgian and Ukrainian governments at a summit in December and discuss whether to let them start membership proceedings. The issue is likely to sharpen divisions within the alliance and the Russians hope the advocates of delay will be stronger after Georgia's attack on South Ossetia.</p> <p>Starting the process of letting Georgia and Ukraine join Nato would be \"a seriously destabilising factor\", the Russian president said. \"We don't understand what Nato can gain by drawing in nations that are still at a crossroads, where the elites and people are split, where there has been no referendum, and where there is a major risk of separatism,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>All ailing governments have an atmosphere. In the mid-1990s, John Major's slowly expired amid pinstriped rebellions by Eurosceptics and Tory sleaze stories in the papers. In the early 90s, Margaret Thatcher's sickened more suddenly as poll tax protesters rioted and Michael Heseltine quietly plotted. In the early 70s, Ted Heath's was stalked and then strangled by the National Union of Mineworkers.</p> <p>Yet British Labour governments - less common than Conservative ones, less tolerated by the press and, perhaps, by British society as a whole - can seem particularly doomed and melancholy in their final stages. Thirty years ago the then Labour prime minister Jim Callaghan took delivery of two new official cars. Callaghan was a highly patriotic premier, and British manufacturing was in need of a lift after the recession of the mid-70s; so the cars had been ordered from British Leyland, the state-owned car maker. But to many of his government's critics British Leyland's workmanship exemplified all that was unhealthy about the economy under Labour in the 70s. The cars, when they arrived, were found to have 34 mechanical faults between them.</p> <p>They were sent back, repaired and fitted with \u00a3250,000 of security features, a considerable outlay at the time, especially for Callaghan's administration. When the cars were finally ready, the prime minister was taken in one to an official engagement. On the way, he opened one of its electric windows for some air. The window fell in his lap. He lost power nine months later.</p> <p>This example of how accident-prone prime ministers can become when their fortunes turn downward comes from the diaries of Bernard Donoughue, Callaghan's senior policy adviser during his three years as premier. Downing Street Diary is in some ways an old-fashioned political book, fat and exhaustive as the many lunches it recalls at Old Labour's favourite restaurant, the Gay Hussar in Soho. Its busy, opinionated pages describe a compelling but vanished political world, of \"dangerous Trotskyites\" infiltrating the Labour party, and vast nationalised industries, and fraught loan negotiations between Britain and the International Monetary Fund. </p> <p>Yet in other ways the diaries feel eerily current. They detail Callaghan's disastrous decision in 1978, seemingly so similar to Gordon Brown's last year, not to hold a general election during a surge of popularity for his government. They show ministers and advisers fixated by bad opinion polls. They feature a hungry new opposition leader who, whatever the government does, increasingly makes the political weather.</p> <p>\"I waited 30 years to publish, until everyone was off the stage,\" says Donoughue, a streetwise Westminster operator who since the 1970s has been a journalist, a City grandee, briefly a minister under Tony Blair, and is now a Labour peer. \"But you see lots of the same issues in the diaries that you see now: an energy crisis, public sector difficulties, trade unions being difficult. The present government is still not able to resolve many of the issues that were around in the 70s.\" </p> <p>Britain, Donoughue and his diaries imply, has not been reformed as completely since the 70s as later governments have liked to make out.</p> <p>Downing Street Diary also offers a vivid day-by-day account of how a government fails and what that feels like on the inside. In the beginning, however difficult a situation the new premier inherits, there is optimism. Callaghan became prime minister in 1976. Harold Wilson, the great showman of postwar Labour politics, had abruptly resigned after presiding ineffectually over Britain's worst economic downturn since the 1930s. A month into the new government, Donoughue could write admiringly: \"Jim has three layers: on the surface is Simple Honest Bluff Jim. Below that is a very cunning and secretive politician ... beneath that is somebody who does believe in the simple and honest virtues.\" When Brown replaced Blair last year, Donoughue felt that the same switch from flash to shrewdness was taking place: \"I thought, 'This is Callaghan after Wilson'.\" </p> <p>Callaghan, like Brown, immediately faced crises: out-of-control state spending, a weak economy, a vulnerable currency. And like Brown, at first he and his government appeared to relish them. Donoughue's diaries are full of dashes between meetings, and late-night sessions drawing up blueprints for national salvation. \"That was an appalling time,\" he says, \"I wouldn't wish it on anybody.\" But then he laughs. \"There is nothing in life - nothing - to equal having a position of influence in No 10. Both for the upside and the downside. And in the 70s there were things you could feel passionately attached to.\" </p> <p>Between 1976 and 1978 the Callaghan government, according to its defenders, rescued Labour and Britain from the abyss of the mid-70s and began to create a workable new version of British socialism. At this point Donoughue still believed the Tories were beatable. \"My view is that we must establish an image of Thatcher as a dangerous woman who will divide our society and create trouble,\" he wrote in February 1978. \"We are doing this now over immigration. I have pressed the PM to take it head-on and attack her for inciting racial hatred ... It is a gamble. She may ride in on the subterranean 'fascistic' instincts which are very widespread at a time of economic depression and individual frustration such as we have had in the past three years. But I think that we might damage her in a long general election campaign.\" </p> <p>Then things started to go wrong. There was the postponement of the election. There was the government's falling-out with the unions. And Callaghan became more uncertain and withdrawn. \"The PM was upstairs in the study all morning,\" Donoughue recorded a year later. \"He dealt with papers and ... fiddled around with this and that.\" He sees the same happening to Brown and his lieutenants: \"If things go wrong, you work harder. You lose perspective, and just get tireder.\"</p> <p>Official engagements abroad become a delicious relief from the struggle. The diaries turn lyrical when Donoughue goes to India and America. Callaghan, infamously, went to palmy Guadeloupe for a summit during the great waves of strikes in the Winter of Discontent. But the drabness and difficulties of domestic politics wait to ambush returning prime ministers: back from Guadeloupe, Callaghan held a testy press conference about the strikes in an airport corridor. \"Crisis? What Crisis?\" was the Sun's memorably merciless summary of his answers. </p> <p>And when governments seem inadequate, opposition parties often start to seem plausible. \"Mrs Thatcher's speech,\" Donoughue wrote of a Commons debate soon after Callaghan's return, \"was extremely effective, passionate and with a slashing attack on the excesses of union power. Typical of her at her best, articulating popular resentment and prejudices.\" </p> <p>A fortnight later he recorded: \"Question Time did not go too well ... The Tories are an unbeatable horse ... The PM ... just looked weak.\" Observers of Brown being taunted by David Cameron and George Osborne in the Commons this year will know what he means.</p> <p>At some stage failing governments pass a point of no return. For Callaghan, this came in early 1979, when the Winter of Discontent was at its iciest and his administration seemed numbed. Donoughue wrote on 18 January: \"The flow of [official] papers has completely stopped ... Whitehall has come to a total halt while they wait to see which way the cat will jump politically.\" He remembers now, \"It was like being on a liner in mid-ocean when all the engines have stopped. Just drifting silently. The civil service just backs off. If they thought Brown was going to lose power imminently, that would happen again.\"</p> <p>Another terminal symptom is the subtle act of disloyalty by a high-profile minister. \"People start positioning themselves for the future,\" Donoughue continues. \"Cultivating union support in case they should make a bid for the leadership. Not going on TV to defend the government. Making speeches that are more about the future than the present.\" Do David Miliband's activities this summer fit this pattern? Donoughue pauses. As a Labour peer, he will have a little positioning of his own to do should Brown fall. \"I wasn't sure.\"</p> <p>Of course, no two governments follow the same arc. The popularity and effectiveness of Callaghan's rose and fell with the period's volatile economy and industrial relations. Right up to the last days of the 1979 general election campaign, senior Labour and Conservative politicians and respected commentators suspected cunning old \"Uncle Jim\" might just win. The trajectory of the Brown administration has been much more relentlessly downward. </p> <p>But Donoughue has not quite written it off. \"In 79, at the start of the campaign, we were 22% behind in an Observer poll. On election day we lost by 7%. We clawed back 15 points. That's why Gordon should read about that period. Things were even worse then.\" The current government, he points out, has still got nearly two years to erase its 20% deficit in the polls. And if it doesn't? \"Opposition is always bad. You fight each other. If we go into opposition, we'll go in for 10 or 15 years.\"</p> <p>His party's often bleak history supports this prediction. At the fag end of Blair and Brown's long ascendancy, it is sometimes easy to forget that, well over a century since its foundation, Labour has only had half a dozen periods in office in Britain. And when Labour governments have most decisively lost general elections - 1931, 1951 and 1979 - each time it has then spent more than a dozen years in opposition. If a sinking Labour administration is one of British politics' sadder spectacles, then Labour's many decades out of office, dominated by prime ministers that never quite were, like Hugh Gaitskell, John Smith and Neil Kinnock, represent an equally fundamental form of failure.</p> <p>The day after the 1979 election, Donoughue recorded: \"As I walked across Horse Guards Parade to get my car from its privileged parking space for the last time, I was held up by a speeding cavalcade of black cars. Mrs Thatcher waved, unseeing, as she flashed by towards Whitehall. A second car was full of police. A third was ... driven by [Callaghan's] former driver... The latter peeled off across Horse Guards to the back of No 10 and [Callaghan's former private secretary] Ken Stowe leaped out and sprinted through the back gate... in order to be there, waiting inside the front door, with the applauding lines of staff, greeting his new prime minister.\"</p> <p>Power can taste flat to a beleaguered government. But it soon gets its fizz back when you lose it.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Andy Beckett is writing a book for Faber about British politics in the 1970s</p> <h2>Diary of a defeat</h2> <p><strong>21 December 1978:</strong> The No 10 Xmas party ... The PM led everybody in singing hymns in the pillared room. Everybody sang their heads off (except me, as I cannot sing!) and it was very jolly. The PM then made a nice speech, which I felt had a touch of suspicion that it might be his last Christmas in No 10. </p> <p><strong>9 January 1979: </strong>The general situation feels much worse, even though the oil tanker drivers are going to settle. The road haulage strike is deteriorating, and the railways are going to strike. Suddenly there is madness in the air, with unions threatening strikes long before the negotiating procedures have been completed. This looks very bad for the big claims that lie ahead - coal, gas, electricity, the local authorities and the civil service, as well as road haulage, all within the next seven weeks. We cannot take them all on at once. So they could sweep our counter-inflation policy away - and we don't have much else.</p> <p><strong>2 February: </strong>A depressing week. They are making progress in the talks with the TUC, but down on the ground it is terrible. These pickets are letting the sick die and preventing the dead from being buried. This has nothing to do with trade unionism. It is hard-faced, grab-what-you-can capitalism with a union card. The government has not come out of it well. </p> <p><strong>5 March: </strong>This is the fifth anniversary since we came into office. What hopes, what excitements, what boredoms and disappointments I have experienced. My main feelings now are of our impotence to move such a complex society in the right direction when the whole national personality is clearly deteriorating; and that this government is without motivation or impetus.</p> <p><strong>5 April: </strong>I am starting the campaign pretty tired. God knows what I shall feel like in a month's time. I hope the PM can survive. </p> <p><strong>10 April: </strong>The press has been appalling. It ignores what the PM says and just picks up stories to embarrass him. The same Tory \"lines\" also crop up each day in the Telegraph, Sun, Mail and Express. They are all written in Tory central office. </p> <p><strong>26 April: </strong>If we lose it will be for four reasons. Two self-inflicted: the winter strikes and the excesses of various Labour local authorities. One positive Tory feature, their tax cut policies. And a deeper secular trend of people \"wanting a change\". </p> <p><strong>2 May</strong>: The last day before the poll. And the weather is appalling - freezing cold, rain, hail and snow. In May! God really is a Tory. The forecast is bad for tomorrow as well. </p> <p><strong>3 May:</strong> This is the fatal polling day. On the way into town I called in at our local polling station. It seemed very quiet, just a trickle of old ladies. I could tell from the determined look in their eyes that they had not come to vote FOR anybody ... The early results from England were discouraging. Although it was not a surprise, I felt completely numbed. Not tired ... Not bitterly disappointed - I never really thought we would win. Just flat and numb. As if bereaved, as if somebody close to me had died, predictably but still a sad loss, leaving a void. </p> <p>We had lost. Mr Callaghan would have to resign as prime minister tomorrow morning.

  "<p>We are now at what we would call, in horseracing parlance, the end of the back stretch. The presidential debates - three of them, to be held on September 26, October 7 and October 15 - will constitute the clubhouse turn. Then, down the stretch they'll come for the final three weeks.</p> <p>What are the major lessons so far, the Big Questions, of this presidential election? Eleven months ago in these pages, I wrote: \"Let me offer what I think is the most important undercurrent question of next year's election: have Americans tired of conservatism, or have they merely tired of corrupt and incompetent conservatism?\"</p> <p>Unlike much of what I've written, those sentences actually hold up to time's remorseless glare. That, I think, is still the question.</p> <p>The problem is, we don't know the answer, and we won't know until probably the early hours of Wednesday, November 5. If Barack Obama wins, no matter how narrowly, we can speak of a nation that wanted a change, of course. If John McCain ekes it out, we can conclude that enough Americans were given enough reason to think twice. Conservative governance will continue.</p> <p>But for now that's all speculative, and the race right now isn't really about those things. Right now what we have is an extreme cage fight in which, on November 4, one or the other will crawl out, bloodied and beaten, but victorious. And soon thereafter the bloodied winner has to start actually being the president. Yes, it's nuts</p> <p>So which side is better equipped to win the cage fight? It's a more complex question than it seems, because the two campaigns have diametrically opposed ideas about how to achieve that victory. This is a unique situation. Usually, Republican and Democratic presidential campaigns have roughly the same theory of how to win. It's just that Republicans are better at implementing the theory. But this time, the Obama camp has a completely different theory. It's why they're not as nervous now as some of their extremely fretful supporters are.</p> <p>This is the field operation versus the news-cycle election.</p> <p>The McCain campaign is the news-cycle campaign. It is built around its television advertisements and attention-getting claims made on the stump that are all about winning that day's news cycle. </p> <p>The basic idea is, if you win enough news cycles, you've dominated the discourse, you've manipulated the news coverage, you've gotten your message out at the other fellow's expense, you've kept him on the defensive. Do all that and you're going to win. Many of these advertisements and claims are contemptible lies (see sidebar). The nature of McCain's campaign is all the more shameful considering that he's doing many of the exact things that were done to him by George Bush's campaign in 2000 -and employing some of the self-same people who did it to him to do it to Obama. </p> <p>As I write, the American political media are gently rousing themselves towards a state of backlash, and we will have to see where that leads. But as the old saying goes, a lie can get halfway around the world before the truth can even get its boots on, and so here we are. </p> <p>The McCain adverts have had a big effect. They started in earnest just as Obama was returning from his trip to Europe. These ads weren't lies, but were outlandishly wily attempts to paint Obama as a lightweight. The celebrity-Britney Spears-Paris Hilton ad was one that people liked to say turned them off, even as its message somehow sunk in. The day after he returned from what was by any objective measure a successful trip, Obama led McCain by 8 points in one major daily tracking poll. But within a few days it had tightened up considerably. The McCain team changed the story of Obama's trip.</p> <p>The news-cycle uber-stroke of the McCain campaign was to announce Sarah Palin as the vice-presidential choice the day after the Democratic convention concluded. Obama had given his well-received speech before 84,000 fans the night before. In previous elections, he would have been able to ride that momentum for a few days. But the McCain camp cut it off utterly. It helped also that no one knew the first thing about Palin. So the American cable news channels that Friday and most of that weekend were about \"Who is Sarah Palin?\" rather than being about \"Obama rides wave, McCain's turn next.\" When Palin turned out to be beloved of the rightwing electoral base and have an intriguing family life to boot, so much the better. Obama wasn't the story.</p> <p>Since the conventions, Team McCain has kept up its barrage, daily and sometimes hourly launching new attacks and continuing to promote false claims about Palin's \"record of reform\" (that she opposed federal funding for a bridge that she in fact supported until it became politically unwise to do so, that she fought federal \"pork-barrel\" spending that she had in fact sought for her state). </p> <p>The point is to press the advantage in the daily news cycle and create a narrative. Republican thinking was put on display, perhaps too candidly for the McCain campaign's tastes, by a Republican strategist, John Feehery, who is not with the campaign but who told the Washington Post: \"The more the New York Times and Washington Post go after Sarah Palin, the better off she is, because there's a bigger truth out there and the bigger truths are she's new, she's popular in Alaska and she's an insurgent. As long as those are out there, these little facts don't really matter.\" Little facts. Nice one.</p> <p>The success of the news-cycle strategy so far has a lot of liberals calling their cardiologists. And maybe with good reason. McCain is now ahead in some polls, tied in others. He has certainly won almost every news cycle since the conventions closed.</p> <p>But the questions about the strategy are these: are regular Americans paying much attention to these news cycles? And even if they are, do they believe everything they see on TV? This is where the field operation strategy comes in. </p> <p>In Denver, I attended a meeting between journalists and Obama campaign manager David Plouffe arranged by Time magazine. Plouffe laid out the theory: the Obama camp isn't that panicked about news cycles, we're looking longer term, he said. Team Obama has sunk massive amounts of money into a huge number of field offices in competitive states (some conservative states aren't worth fighting in and liberal states are in the bag already). At the last comprehensive count, the Obama campaign had 336 field offices around the country, and McCain 101. McCain has probably opened more recently, but the disparity is still striking.</p> <p>Some state-by-state comparisons are useful. In Ohio, Obama has 33 offices, and McCain nine. In Michigan, it's 22-11. Virginia, 28-6; Iowa, 23-6; New Mexico, 18-1; Missouri, 27-7. You get the picture. Florida is the only competitive state where McCain has more offices, 35-25. That 35 is deeply uncharacteristic for McCain, probably explained by the fact that much of the McCain vote in Florida will be elderly and will need to be driven to the polls on election day.</p> <p>In addition, the Obama campaign is counting on a large voter-registration effort that's been ongoing in key states since 2006. Twenty-eight of the 50 states enroll voters according to party affiliation, and in those states, Democrats have gained 2 million voters in the last two years, while the Republicans have lost 334,000. Numbers for 2008 alone look like this in some important states: Colorado, 66,516 Democrats to 13,352 Republicans; Florida, 209,422 Democrats to 77,196 Republicans; Iowa, 69,301 Democrats to 7,515 Republicans; Pennsylvania, 98,137 Democrats to just 289 Republicans. </p> <p>It takes a lot of time and money to register all those people and set up all those offices. The Obama people are betting that the investment will pay off. It is their belief, Plouffe said in Denver, that most people pay more attention to their co-workers and neighbours than they do to television talking heads. And with all those neighbours and co-workers spreading the word on election day, they say they feel good about the situation they've created. Field, they say, will trump news cycle.</p> <p>So there you have it. Are the Obama people right? The problems with their theory are that all this field-tilling is invisible to pundits, and that there's no way to measure its success until the votes start coming in. In the meantime, McCain is very much winning the visible war, which can be measured day-to-day. And, since he named Palin, enthusiasm on the right is sky high, so he'll have his army of volunteers now, too. </p> <p>One doesn't doubt that the Obama turnout will be impressive. But there are 51 daily news cycles between now and November 4. Obama certainly needs to win a few of them. So let's sort all that out first. Then we'll talk about the big picture.</p> <h2>Dirty tricks</h2> <p><strong>McCain campaign's misleading statements ...</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> It said Obama supported teaching sex education at kindergartens in Illinois. In fact, Obama voted for, but did not sponsor, legislation that would have allowed local school districts to provide \"age-appropriate\" sex education as a way of teaching young children to be wary of sexual predators. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> McCain said Obama would end new weapons programmes needed to keep America safe. Yet a McCain adviser has listed \"future combat systems\" as a programme that should be cut.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Palin has made her opposition to the \"bridge to nowhere\", a $223m span linking an Alaskan island, a centrepiece of the team's portrayal of her as a fiscally responsible governor. But Palin initially supported the project and abandoned it after the Congress did so. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> During Obama's trip to Europe this summer, McCain said his rival ditched plans to visit wounded troops in Germany because journalists were forbidden from accompanying him. Obama aides said they cancelled the visit because they did not want to use injured soldiers as campaign props.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> McCain has often claimed Obama would raise taxes. But non-partisan analysis found Obama would cut taxes for low- and middle-income households, while raising payroll taxes on those earning more than $250,000.</p> <p><strong>Democrats stretch the truth too ...</strong></p> <p>Obama and other Democrats have said McCain would keep US troops in Iraq for 100 years, referring to remarks McCain made in January. McCain was clearly describing a situation in which non-combat forces could stay in Iraq, similar to US deployments in South Korea, Germany and elsewhere after wars.<br><strong>Daniel Nasaw</strong></p>",
  "<p>Silvio Berlusconi's rescue plan for Alitalia was last night on the brink of collapse after the consortium he put together to save the airline's \"Italian-ness\" walked out of talks with unions.</p> <p>Alitalia would be the first European flag-carrier to go bust since Sabena, of Belgium, and Swissair in 2001, and is in the hands of a bankruptcy commissioner who was due to begin liquidation proceedings yesterday.</p> <p>In a desperate attempt to save the company - and to save face - the government gave the unions one more day in which to come up with their own proposal. Thousands of jobs were riding on the response.</p> <p>Last night, more than 100 cabin crew staged a protest in the international check-in area at Rome's Fiumicino airport. The demonstrators chanted \"dignity and respect\" and appealed to colleagues not to board flights.</p> <p>In a statement, the transport and employment ministers in Berlusconi's right-wing government promised to avert \"irreversible acts\" by either the bankruptcy commissioner or the all-Italian consortium. But employment minister Maurizio Sacconi, said: \"The scope for mediation has, I believe, been exhausted.\"</p> <p>Emma Marcegaglia, the head of Confindustria, Italy's employers' federation, said she had expected tough negotiations, but \"it was hoped that a deadlock could be avoided\". She was speaking after seven days of contacts between the unions and Alitalia's would-be investors had culminated in an entire night of fruitless discussion. A spokesman for the consortium, formed to take over the profitable parts of Alitalia, said the unions did not \"appreciate the grave situation of Alitalia or the need for profound discontinuity with the past\".</p> <p>The unions protested at what they claimed was a \"take-it-or-leave-it\" approach by putative investors. The representative of the UIL, the most moderate of Italy's three big trade union federations, said: \"We have an increasingly strong suspicion that [the consortium] wants Alitalia to collapse so as to grab it afterwards.\"</p> <p>Protests by the unions were strikingly reminiscent of those that drove away an earlier bid, from Air France-KLM in April. On that occasion the unions had an assurance from Berlusconi, who had just been re-elected prime minister, that a group of Italian investors was ready to buy the airline.</p> <p>Though it took several months for a consortium to emerge, 19 companies and individuals expressed a readiness last month to sink a total of \u20ac1bn (\u00a3797m) into a relaunched Alitalia. Under a plan drawn up by Intesa Sanpaolo bank, the existing firm's vast debts - at least \u20ac1.2bn - would be dumped on the taxpayer. </p> <p>The profitable bits of Alitalia would be hived off into a new airline that would also incorporate its main domestic competitor, Air One. And, at a later stage, it was intended a foreign partner would take a minority stake of 20%-25%.</p> <p>The investors made it clear from the outset they envisaged a much smaller and cost-effective airline, stripped of many of its intercontinental routes. They made it clear they would only go ahead if the unions signed their business plan. That meant about 5,000 job losses and, according to the union side, pay reductions of up to 40%. </p> <p>On Thursday, protests by Alitalia workers forced the cancellation of some 50 flights from Fiumicino and delayed scores of others.</p> <p>Unlike other troubled airlines, Alitalia is not just a victim of high oil prices. Even before the government began trying to sell it two years ago, it was reckoned to have lost at least \u20ac3bn.</p>",
  "<p>In the past you had to go to all the trouble of becoming a university student to witness first-hand the sick games psychologists dreamed up in order to demonstrate how predictably shallow human beings could be. Today we can watch the same dastardly social experiments almost every night of the week on our television sets.</p> <p>From I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, which replicates the rival conflict and eventual harmony of the Robber's Cave experiment of 1961 to Love Island's use of false consensus bias all reality TV is based on psychological conflict. Although it's hardly Abu Ghraib, future generations may wonder why we enjoyed watching strangers torture one another so much. Mind violence? We bloody love it.</p> <p>The infamous Stanford prison experiment in 1971 - which divided students into prison guards and prisoners in a mock prison and got out of hand when the guards started enjoying it too much - has been used several times by Big Brother. But one infamous psychological test is yet to make it to reality TV. Palo Alto, California high school teacher Ron Jones's 1967 experiment, known as The Third Wave, has quite possibly not made it into a cunning gameshow format because the one time it was attempted it successfully turned an average class of middle-class students into the living embodiment of Hitler youth.</p> <p>Based on Jones's experiment but poignantly transferred to present-day Germany, a brilliant new movie Die Welle (The Wave) serves as a warning of how simple psychological mind tricks can transform disaffected people into fascists. Director Dennis Gansel, whose acclaimed Before The Fall was about the nazification of young Germans in the 1930s, felt compelled to make the film for several reasons. He was interested in the fundamental psychology of group pressure and he felt that Germans, especially young Germans, were becoming too blas\u00e9 about the past.</p> <p>\"I am part of the so-called third generation,\" he says. \"We grew up with grandparents who'd been in the war; my Grandfather always caused family arguments by saying life under Hitler wasn't so bad. Researching the film we sat in on the history lessons of 16- and 17-year-olds. We realised how remote the second world war was to them and how bored they were by it.\"</p> <p>The Wave begins with a class grumbling about a project week studying autocracy and the inevitability that it's likely to go over the familiar ground of the Third Reich and Hitler. \"The Nazis sucked,\" one pupil says. \"We get it. We can't feel guilty forever.\"</p> <p>Faced with such indifference, the teacher - a left-leaning ex-punk who still listens to the Ramones as he drives to work - devises a plan to practically demonstrate the subject to his class. After getting them to agree to take part in a fun experiment he elects himself leader and tells them that for the week ahead they must address him as Mr Wegner and stand up whenever they speak. It begins innocently enough. He teaches them correct posture, how to breathe correctly and to answer questions succinctly; he encourages the stronger students to help the weak and demonstrates unity by getting them to march in time. Rather than rebelling, the class ends the day feeling empowered by the message of \"strength through discipline\".</p> <p>Wegner, like the real-life Ron Jones, is excited too and feels as if he's stumbled upon a new method of reaching his students. Next they're giving their movement a name - The Wave - deciding on white shirts as a uniform, inventing a salute that looks a bit like a dance move from a Steps video, designing a logo and - because this is 2008 - uploading a MySpace page. It's the best fun any of them have ever had at school.</p> <p>At this point The Wave not only starts spreading among people outside of the fictional class but looks like a movement that would appeal to anyone watching it. Articulating a common disillusionment, Marco one of the students complains that there is nothing to rebel against. \"Nothing means anything any more,\" he says. \"We all just want to have fun. What our generation lacks is a common goal to unite us.\"</p> <p>\"That's based on me when I was 17,\" says Gansel. \"I really wanted to be part of something that made a change. My father was always telling me, 'We changed society in Berlin '68.' And I was like, 'Yeah, yeah, fantastic but I want my moment.' This is something I saw a lot of in the teenagers we interviewed. Everybody's looking for something and it's as if there's nothing left for them. The film is exactly that: the danger of what happens when there is nothing to fulfil that desire.\"</p> <p>The Wave mirrors what happened in California where the group swelled to huge numbers before becoming violent and out of control. Ron Jones's solution was a radical one. He told his disciples that there were organisations like theirs simultaneously springing up throughout America and that they were to gather around a TV in the dining hall where they would see a live broadcast announcing their own presidential candidate. Instead, Jones jarred them to their senses by projecting a film of Nazi atrocities. The Wave's climax is different but similarly extreme, especially for a film that despite its far-fetched premise succeeds in getting natural and believable performances from its cast.</p> <p>\"We had to do it,\" says Gansel. \"A large part of The Wave seems very appealing - the togetherness and community. That was the reason for this very hard and harsh ending because we knew it would be very seductive for a young audience. But my point is that if you want to make a movie about seduction, and how dangerous it is, then you have to be seductive as a film-maker.\"</p> <p>In Germany, patriotism is rare and in recent times only resurfaced during the 2006 World Cup. \"Where I grew up, in Hanover, if you had a German flag in your neighbourhood those people would belong to a new Nazi movement or something like that,\" remembers Gansel. \"This rapidly changed in the summer of 2006; from one day to another there was something like a new courage and people were suddenly proud of Germany which never happened before.\"</p> <p>Although the national pride of 2006 has continued and the German flag is no longer seen as the sole preserve of the right-wing, The Wave has prompted a national debate about the country's identity and whether or not Nazism could happen again.</p> <p>\"We consider ourselves very liberal right now; our chancellor is a woman and we consider 60 years ago will never happen again on German soil. Everyone speaks like that but I think, and in a lot of discussions I heard it, that people are not so sure any more.\"</p> <p>For Ron Jones the aftermath from the account of his experiment being published was a call from religious leader and future mass cyanide poisoner Jim Jones looking for ideas for his Peoples Temple. Indeed it's not hard to imagine a wannabe dictator or cult leader gleaning knowledge from the experiment which is possibly why, until he was persuaded by The Wave's producers, he held on to the rights of his story for over 30 years - including resisting the overtures of TV companies wanting to make reality shows based on it.</p> <p>Like all great psychological TV shows and movies The Wave makes you think what you would do in the same situation. \"Before shooting I was convinced that if it was me I'd be a member of the resistance like Sophie Scholl in the second world war,\" Gansel says. \"Now, I'm not so sure.\" Go and see it and make up your own mind. Unless, that is, you've got plans on becoming a dictator with a fancy logo and a cool website \u00b7</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Wave is out on Friday</p> <h2>Brain pain<br>Seven brilliant onscreen psychological discoveries</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Dark Knight</p> <p><strong>Finding:</strong> Morals don't make you smarter than a psychopath without any. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Enron: The Smartest Guys In The Room</p> <p><strong>Finding:</strong> Clever people do as they're told even when they<br>know it's wrong.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Lost</p> <p><strong>Finding:</strong> We fear the unknown more than what we know to be real.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Lord Of The Flies</p> <p><strong>Finding:</strong> Group pressure can be deadly for those caught on the outside.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Truman Show</p> <p><strong>Finding:</strong> Every single thing you know could be a lie. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Sopranos</p> <p><strong>Finding:</strong> Structure and discipline help people to do terrible things.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here</p> <p><strong>Finding:</strong> Withholding privileges can lead to immature behaviour.</p>",
  "<p>My husband was off to Berlin for 10 weeks, so I had looked forward to a little more room in the bed at nights. But a couple of evenings ago, when I asked Rowena, my three-year-old daughter, to move up an inch, she refused. \"That's Daddy's bit,\" she replied. \"We need to leave it for when he gets back.\"</p> <p>With a weary sigh, I put my head back on my allotted half pillow, found my 1ft-wide strip of bed and rolled over. Rowena stretched out - as ever - and luxuriated across the middle. And thus it has been, pretty much since she was born. </p> <p>For we are a family of co-sleepers - members of a rather furtive tribe who hardly dare own up in public to such an unfashionable practice, at odds with the modern, routine-based childcare experts who think that children are best settled in their own rooms as early as possible to make them independent.</p> <p>Yet is our night-time routine - bath, stories, then at least two and sometimes all three of us into the big bed at 8.30pm, with the grown-ups sneaking out later to tiptoe downstairs for Newsnight - so bizarre? While the supernannies of modern England would chastise us for our poor habits, deliberate co-sleeping - not just children sneaking into Mummy and Daddy's bed when they think they can get away with it - is a practice as old as parenting itself. And it's arguably more natural than the current preoccupation with separating ourselves from our young.</p> <p>Co-sleeping is undoubtedly influenced by culture - in many parts of the world it is still the norm, not the exception. It was the Victorians who set the ground rules for children sleeping in their own bedrooms. According to the historian Nelleke Bakker: \"Character formation was considered the most important goal of child-rearing.\" </p> <p>Cuddling and night lights were out, separate rooms and formality were in.</p> <p>Incredibly, it was not until the early 70s that anyone challenged this way of parenting. When Jean Liedloff, an American writer, spent two-and-a-half years living in the South American jungle with the Yequana Indians, she found a way of life that changed her perspective on human nature. Her book based on her experiences, The Continuum Concept, quickly attracted attention for the way it encouraged parents to adopt a style that owed everything to their long-dead ancestors rather than the more recent ones. </p> <p>Liedloff believed that infants should be carried constantly until they naturally choose to start crawling, that breastfeeding should be on demand and that babies should sleep with their parents until they choose to leave. This, she maintained, would help them become strong, independent adults. Attachment parenting - as this style of parenting was dubbed - has certainly proved popular with some and was followed up in the UK by Deborah Jackson's Three in a Bed in 1989. </p> <p>For Veronika Robinson and her husband, Paul, co-sleeping has been an \"integral part of our parenting\". The couple, who live in Cumbria and co-edit The Mother magazine, have two daughters, Bethany, 12, and Eliza, 10. \"We slept with them both from day one,\" says Veronika. \"It was always our intention to co-sleep.\"</p> <p>During her first pregnancy, Veronika recalls being shown a \"really lovely cradle\", but after reading The Continuum Concept she and Paul decided this was how they would parent their own offspring. It went against her German background, where children were definitely unwelcome in the parental bedroom. \"Before then I suppose I hadn't given it much thought. But the more I learned about what a baby needs,\" says Veronika, \"the more I was sure that the only place my baby should be was in bed with me. Anything else seemed cruel.\"</p> <p>Bethany was born in a home water- birth in March 1996 and a few hours later Veronika and Paul took her into bed with them. \"She slept with us from then on. We had an independent midwife so there was no one to tell us not to or be disapproving.\"</p> <p>Two years later, Eliza arrived in January 1998, born by water-birth in hospital. The couple took every opportunity to hold their infant in the unit before Eliza was allowed to join her mother on the ward. \"As soon as I got her, I put her in my bed. The nurses warned, 'She'll fall out,' so I dragged the mattress off the bed and on to the floor and we slept there. I don't think the hospital had seen anything like it.\"</p> <p>From then on, the four slept together at home across two double mattresses on the floor of the couple's room. \"I was breastfeeding both children so it was much easier. I can't imagine how I would have coped had I had to get up to see to each one in different rooms when they needed me. And Paul was there to help with the nappies.\"</p> <p>There was the odd uncomfortable night: \"I can remember in the very early days lying there unable to get to sleep because I was next to three snorers,\" says Veronika, with a laugh. </p> <p>The girls finally left the big bed for their own beds and rooms when each was about five, although this was a fairly fluid arrangement. \"It took me a few years to adjust,\" says Veronika. \"But Eliza still sleeps with me some nights, although now the girls are bigger, there isn't so much room, so Paul has to swap for her bed. It's like musical beds here sometimes. People say children who co-sleep will become clingy, but we believe when children get a secure foundation, when their needs are met, they grow up to be secure.\" </p> <p>Yet there are serious critics of co-sleeping. Most modern child-rearing experts suggest that babies are best put in a separate cot for the first six months but kept in the parents' room to lessen the risk of cot death - advice given by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Royal College of Midwives. </p> <p>But when my own daughter was a few months old and I wasn't quite so frightened of rolling over and squashing her, I found myself breastfeeding at night in bed and then \"forgetting\" to put Rowena back in her cot. Hearing her soft breath was much more reassuring than my former habit of sneaking over to poke her to check she was still alive. More importantly, she slept better and deeper than in the cot - and so did I.</p> <p>Aware of public health advice, I mentioned to my midwife that we had returned to co-sleeping, only to be roundly cautioned. I was putting my child at risk, I was told. If we could make her go to bed and sleep through, we wouldn't need to co-sleep. </p> <p>Much modern guidance on the matter differentiates between bed-sharing (good) and co-sleeping (bad). According to Unicef's Baby Friendly Initiative (babyfriendly.org.uk): \"Bed-sharing encourages intimate contact between mother and baby, which facilitates a close and loving bond. Successful breastfeeding and better sleep are more common among mothers and babies who share the same bed. Evidence suggests that bed-sharing is common among parents with new babies both in hospital and at home.\" </p> <p>But by this, they don't mean the mother falling asleep too - not unless baby is sleeping in a cot clipped on to the bed. The report warns: \"In certain circumstances, mothers who bed-share may fall asleep whether they intend to [or not]. There is evidence to indicate that co-sleeping is associated with a greater incidence of accident or sudden infant death where certain risk factors are present.\" Of particular concern is the link between smokers and cot death and the danger that if you fall asleep drunk or drugged, you may fail to notice where - or on what - you are lying. </p> <p>Thoroughly ashamed and wary of the danger, my husband and I tried gentle routines. We tried baths and bottles and Beethoven, we tried controlled crying and spent one awful night listening to our little baby scream herself physically sick. In the end, it was too much. Rowena left the cot and came back into the big bed. Friends and acquaintances seemed genuinely shocked that we would want her in our bed. \"How will she learn to be independent?\" was that oft-repeated Victorian-sounding fear. </p> <p>We were lucky - unlike many, we had lots of support. My mother revealed that she had co-slept with my father, my two sisters and myself for years and that she had never banished a cot from the bedroom. My sister-in-law also revealed that her children had spent most nights in her marital bed. </p> <p>Instinct drove 38-year-old Michelle Burfitt, a secondary-school teacher from Swindon, to bring her son Rhys (now aged two) into bed when he was just two days old. Having gone through an unwanted caesarean in April 2006, when she heard her son cry out at night in the hospital, she didn't waste time buzzing for help as instructed. She just leant over and picked him up by his pyjamas. </p> <p>The midwife who arrived in her room not long after was horrified - \"You'll have ruined him by morning,\" she announced. Michelle admits that even though she knew this sentiment was an overreaction, she still felt bad. \"I was flabbergasted,\" she admits.</p> <p>Michelle followed the WHO advice for the first six months, keeping Rhys in a cot close to the bed she shares with her husband, John, 46. After seven months, she tried to move him into his own room. By eight months, his sleep had become so disturbed he was waking 15 times in a night. </p> <p>She adds: \"I read so many books and stressed myself. Looking back, I now think he was such a tiny thing, why would I want to separate myself from him anyway? As a society we want children to be integrated with our schedule and we miss the point and the value of having them.\" John took matters into his own hands and built a co-sleeper platform for their bed: a three-sided cot that could take a mattress. \"It was such a joy waking up with him and beside him,\" she says. \"Those memories are something I'll cherish.\"</p> <p>But Michelle, too, was finding it an awkward subject with other mothers. \"Some seemed to measure success as 'sleeping through the night in their own beds'. Sleep always seemed to be the first topic of conversation when you met up, and I didn't want to talk about it.\"</p> <p>She has heard, too, as I have, some couples' concerns that their own time for intimacy will be lost if at least one child is always snoring away in the middle of the bed. \"You make other times,\" she says, patiently, \"and intimacy doesn't always include sex.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, I have finally been able to own up to the truth: I like co-sleeping. I find it a natural way to parent, I find it easy to soothe my child when she's unwell and our breathing seems to calm each other down into instant sleep. Instinctively, and perhaps controversially, I also feel that as a working mother I am somehow making up for the lost daylight hours by being around her at night. </p> <p>Even on those nights when I have been edged out of bed almost completely, I don't complain about the way we sleep. \"When she does sleep in her own room,\" warns my husband, \"you'll be sorry.\" And I will.</p>",
  "<p>I have always been married. My mother harboured a specific plan for my marriage before I was even born. I was married generations before my birth, just as my wife, Saliha, was destined to be my companion before we ever met. We met but briefly and never alone before we were married. As it was, so it is and ever will be, because it works.</p> <p>Arranged marriage fascinates people in Britain. Rather like watching horror films, you are attracted for shock value. Or maybe it's just because you like to sniff and turn up your noses at something considered so irredeemably backward it makes you feel superior. But given the state of family life in Britain today, with binge-drinking adolescents, gangs and teenage violence, the time is ripe not to scoff.</p> <p>The Asian family is not a nuclear unit of parents and 2.4 children. It is an extended social unit that includes grandparents, in-laws, aunts and uncles and a long list of relatives, each with a specific title in relation to everyone else in the family. And Asian family values are focused on keeping the unit together - in one physical place if possible - and providing mutual support. The corollary is that you have to accept them on the same terms. It can be onerous, inconvenient, not to say downright demanding. </p> <p>Arranged marriages work in this framework of extended family. They are the heartbeat of Asian tradition. Without this pulse coursing through our lives, everything we know and think as British Asians atrophies and starts to die. </p> <p>A certain amount of debriefing is necessary at this point. Arranged marriages are not forced marriages. That is quite another phenomenon related to tribal customs. Some of these tribal customs are alive and well in places such as Bradford and Manchester. It is for the honour of the tribe that Asian girls are kidnapped, brow-beaten, tortured into marriages. It is due to obnoxious tribal customs that honour killings have come to be part of the British Asian experience. But tribal customs have nothing to do with Asian tradition. </p> <p>So what is an arranged marriage? How is that man deemed an appropriate life partner for that woman and vice versa? The process involves a lot of to and fro and both parties are free to reject or accept. Once the parties have reached a consensus, then both their families and the principals come to agree a marriage should take place. </p> <p>So arranged marriage is a social act because it is not personal and individual. It never involves just two people, each alone with their own angst and dreams. Marriage is much too important to be left to so precarious and potentially perverse and headstrong a basis as the dreams and delusions of a would-be bride and groom. Arranged marriage is not just a marriage between two individuals, but two families. </p> <p>Arranging a marriage is probably the most important social skill. It is also an art form. And its main practitioners are women. The art involves a subtle reading of human character and insight into the needs of those involved - not just at one stage of their lives but as it bears on the entire journey of their lifetime. </p> <p>Consider the case of two sisters whose lives are thrown into turmoil by political events. The partition of India was mass trauma. The sisters were uprooted from all the normality they had known and had to trek to Pakistan along with their extensive family. But making a new life in a new place sent family members hiving off in all directions to find jobs and opportunity. The bonds of family seemed to be weakening, indeed on the verge of destruction. So the sisters hatched a plan to countermand the forces that were shattering their tradition. If their first-born children were a boy and a girl then they would arrange their marriage to one another. In this way they could preserve the family and pass on to their offspring the solidity and support the sisters had once known.</p> <p>How could two women conceive of such a scheme for two people they had not yet conceived? And why would they imagine such a premature arrangement could possibly have a chance of succeeding? Well, consider that as sisters they shared a common heritage of values, socialisation, education and all the nurturing that goes into giving people a similar outlook on life and requirement of human behaviour. Who better to trust to pass these most cherished values and grooming on to a new generation than one's own sister? </p> <p>The force of events sundered the two sisters with a new partition: one emigrated with her husband and settled in Britain, taking with them her first-born son who was destined to become that new creation, a British Asian. The other sister remained in Pakistan, where in time she gave birth to a daughter, as a citizen of the \"land of the pure\". This new generation was shaped in different nationalities, circumstances and seemingly disparate times. And neither sister had ever mentioned this scheme to the offspring concerned. But the time came when the arrangement had to be put in place. </p> <p>There was, however, a problem. Having grown to manhood as a British Asian, the young man was far from content to learn of the future so long planned as his destiny. When he was taken on a purposeful visit to Pakistan and confronted with this choice, he rejected the suggestion. But when he saw his potential bride, he was immediately attracted to her. Would he, he asked her directly, make a suitable husband? \"Yes,\" she replied, \"but not for me.\" </p> <p>So there was a paradox: he rejected the idea of arranged marriage but wanted the person with whom the marriage was arranged. She accepted the idea but rejected the person. When his brother was presented with a similar choice, he rejected everything and simply walked away. But as the eldest son this easy option was not available to him. </p> <p>Arranged marriages can be a long, drawn-out affair. So, over three years, with letters flying between London and Lahore, endless discussions and much angst, minds were changed. Eventually, both parties were convinced that this was their best option. And that is how I came to be married.</p> <p>Arranged marriages are not about setting two people adrift together. Those who arranged my marriage did not depart from the scene. My mother still lives with me and has played a vital part in rearing my children. And my extended family is ever present, ever ready to share and ease the burdens, to support and encourage and to provide the safety net that does not permit the married couple to fall through the cracks. </p> <p>What I learned through my own experience is that marriage begins as commitment - love, sex, mutual respect, affection and friendship are the benefits that accrue over time. Instead of beginning at the pitch of pheromone intensity, arranged marriage gives time and space to appreciate another person without the insecurities of transience. </p> <p>In Britain, arranged marriages are exceptionally popular among young British Asians. But why would someone born and bred in modern Britain go for a traditional arrangement? I asked a young woman called Farzana at a cultural gathering in Bradford. \"Because,\" she replied, \"I don't want to humiliate myself by dancing to the tune of the dating game.\" Everywhere in Britain, Farzana told me, women get the same message: dress, dye your hair, make up your face, buy the right perfume and, most of all, be shapely, diet yourself to misery or starve yourself to death in a land of plenty, and all to get a man. It is inherently demeaning. In contrast, many young Asians think that arranged marriages enhance their personal freedom and dignity. Instead of learning womanly wiles to please and entrap men, they can become themselves and be introduced to men equally intent and committed to the concept of a life-long relationship. There is many an affront to human dignity that can be avoided by sharing the burden of finding a partner with caring relatives.</p> <p>Behind every arranged marriage is a story. I discovered many while writing Balti Britain, a book about the British Asian experience. But I also discovered that arranged marriages are not static, immovable objects in the flow of time. Like many other marriages, they are flexible and adept, malleable and serviceable to time and changing circumstances. The principles on which they work, the objectives they seek to fulfil, endure through time. Almost everything else is open to negotiation. </p> <p>So it is not surprising that the newest generation of British Asians, who are indeed more British than their parents and grandparents, have reinvented the whole concept of arranged marriage. The process now involves finding a partner first and then getting the family to arrange the marriage. And if education, work, membership of societies and clubs or the network of family gatherings does not offer the opportunity to encounter who is out there in need of a wife or a husband, there is always speed dating. At an Asian speed dating event, where the whole family is welcome, you can check people out without the embarrassment of being lumbered with the greatest bore, most insufferable scoundrel or impossible narcissist for an entire evening or longer. As my daughter, Maha, who ran an Asian speed dating company as a side line, assured me, it fills a vacant niche and gives young British Asians the means to honour the meaning of tradition, with modern modifications.</p> <p>And so it was that my daughter presented me with an immensely personable and exemplary young man and required me to arrange her marriage. Like the parents of her chosen one, my wife and I were a little at a loss about exactly what arrangement was required. But eventually our children gave us the prompt. What our children wanted was the arrangement of family, the cementing of bonds between two entities that would always be part of their lives because they could not conceive of being alone. </p> <p>The wedding provided all the nervous tension, angst and drama in the preparation one would expect. But in my in-laws I have acquired new family members, people who share a common outlook on life and on whom I know I can rely to be as interested and concerned as I always will be for the welfare of my child. The wheel turns, the meaning endures. </p> <p>To those who scoff at arranged marriages I only have this to say: look at your own dilemmas of family breakdowns, divorce, human despair and what your children are up to. And if you want to secure ongoing continuity of love, comfort and support in your old age, go for an arranged marriage. You could save yourself and do Britain a favour at the same time. </p> <p>Ziauddin Sardar's Balti Britain: A Journey Through the British Asian Experience is published by Granta, \u00a320.

  "<p>He looks calm, perhaps even a little stern - the image of the perfect soldier. But, slumped in a corner of the recreation room at the Mons barracks in Aldershot five years later, Adam Moran recalls something very different. The photograph of his platoon taken in Basra in April 2003 hides a \u201cworld of turmoil\u201d, he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand the army, couldn\u2019t stand it. I was misled. I was told at a careers thing in Birmingham that I would never have to wear a uniform and that I could go round the world boxing. I was told I\u2019d be a tracksuit soldier, that it would be the time of my life.\u201d</p> <p>Just a few weeks after passing out (completing basic training), Moran found himself on the frontline in Iraq. \u201cMy head was spinning,\u201d he says. Moran, now 29, was part of 3 Platoon 1 Company Irish Guards. In March 2003, as part of the Scots Dragoon Battle Group, the 34 soldiers in the photograph above (Moran is in the second row, fourth from left) were among thousands of allied forces dispatched from Kuwait across the deserts of southern Iraq as part of the US-led mission to overthrow Saddam Hussein. The men of 3 Platoon were among the first - they believe the first - into Basra, Iraq\u2019s second city and main port. They were given the task of first encircling, then by night pushing farther into Basra, taking on what remained of Saddam\u2019s army.</p> <p>Five years on, the number of British troops has dwindled from 45,000 to 4,000 based at an airport outside Basra city, and the Ministry of Defence is talking about cutting back further, to just a few hundred, in the first half of next year.</p> <p>But what has happened to the men of 3 Platoon? What do they remember of the \u201cMicks\u201d 2003 tour of Iraq? What, if anything, do they recall about the photograph, taken outside a temporary base near Basra University six weeks after they entered the country - and just days before President Bush, aboard an aircraft carrier off the coast of California, declared the war won on May 2? It shows them during a break between patrols, some of them teenagers thrust into weeks of fierce fighting, never having seen action before. More informal than many platoon photographs, there are no regimental banners or flags. The men, known to each other by their nicknames - \u201cRobbo\u201d Robinson, \u201cHappy\u201d Harris, \u201cPicky\u201d Pickford - are dressed in regular fatigues, guns clasped in front of them. \u201cIt\u2019s a working shot,\u201d one of them tells me, with pride.</p> <p>James Moulton bounds across the station concourse at Waterloo in London and, before we have time even to introduce ourselves, offers to do whatever he can to help track down the men he used to command. With his shock of black hair, Moulton is instantly recognisable from the photograph: hands on knees, he stares out confidently from the centre of the front row, the platoon captain, 27 years old. \u201cI can honestly say they were a wonderful bunch - honest, hard-working and decent,\u201d he says. \u201cJust don\u2019t listen if they tell you I spent all my time sunbathing - it\u2019s only half true!\u201d</p> <p>Moulton left the army in 2005 and since then has crisscrossed the globe, acting as a private security consultant in many of the world\u2019s trouble spots, from Haiti to Algeria, Angola to Iraq. \u201cI suppose it has been pretty eventful since I packed it in, but I fear it may be more a sign that I don\u2019t know quite what I want to do when I grow up than anything else.\u201d</p> <p>When I tracked him down, Moulton, now 32, was in Nigeria offering security advice and logistical support to workers in the country\u2019s oilfields. A few weeks later he answers his mobile and lets slip that he\u2019s now in Houston, Texas, having flown in from Iraq hours earlier. It\u2019s 3am. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what country I\u2019m in, let alone what time it is,\u201d he says apologetically.</p> <p>It becomes clear that he often thinks about his time in Basra. He talks about the \u201ccraic\u201d - the good times and the bond built up between the soldiers as the firefights intensified. But he is also keen to convey what he describes as the \u201cstrangeness\u201d of the two-and-a-half-month tour. \u201cIt was very different from anything else I\u2019ve done,\u201d he says. \u201cNot just dangerous, but slightly bizarre. We were out there doing a pretty difficult job, but it was the more mundane things that I often think about these days.\u201d</p> <p>One night they set up camp in what he thinks was a student accommodation block. \u201cI was in a room and it was obviously someone\u2019s home. Their things were there - family pictures and food in the cupboards. It felt quite invasive, and brought home that human side of it - that this was about real people.\u201d</p> <p>Another night, he was lying in a cramped and stuffy warehouse, head to toe with the other soldiers of his platoon. \u201cIt got to the point where you weren\u2019t sure whether it was your feet or someone else\u2019s that you were smelling, but you knew you had to get out. So a few of us took our mats up on to the roof and I was lying there with one of the other guys late one night and tracer bullets were flying over our heads - perhaps five metres above us. We were just chatting and smoking, and it suddenly hit me how normalised the whole thing had become.\u201d</p> <p>Initially, the platoon was given the task of providing security for a British army base at \u201cBridge Four\u201d on one of the main roads south out of the city. But soon they left the relative safety of the base, pushing farther and farther into the city, sleeping in their Warrior armoured vehicles and taking on well-armed Iraqi fighters along the way. They fought their way building by building, room by room, through Basra\u2019s university complex. At one stage, as the fighting became more ferocious, Moulton drove his Warrior down what the platoon had dubbed \u201cmortar mile\u201d. He stuck his head out of the turret in an attempt to draw enemy fire and locate Iraqi artillery. \u201cI remember one RPG [rocket-propelled grenade] went right across in front of us and another from the other side bounced off. There were a lot whizzing around our heads and into the vehicles, and we took a few direct hits. I was too busy trying to identify their positions to worry about being hit, but a few were quite close. It was pretty exciting.\u201d</p> <p>A week later, Moulton calls from Jordan to say he is helping set up a medical evacuation company that will get injured civilians out of Iraq. He says he has been up in Kurdistan for a while, \u201cplaying around with planes\u201d. We talk about his new business venture before the conversation turns back to the 2003 tour. Does he have any regrets?</p> <p>He pauses. \u201cOf course there are problems now - the main one seems to be a lack of planning about what we were going to do after the first phase. But I suppose I think I am pleased I was there, if anyone was, because - and I suppose this sounds pretty arrogant - I trust my judgment, I trust that I will try to do the right thing at the right time.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the others in the photograph are harder to locate. Neither the MoD nor the regiment keeps a record of what happens to soldiers who leave the army, and some simply cut their ties and move on.</p> <p>All that was known of the man with the moustache on the far left of the photograph was that he was probably called Jones and may have moved north, perhaps to Liverpool. His first name could be David. The soldier directly below him (third row from front, far left), slightly smiling, eyes narrowed in the sun, is known as \u201cJR\u201d Hartley, after a character in an 80s TV advert. JR\u2019s friends say he left the army a couple of years ago and now lives somewhere in Northern Ireland. A ring-round of Hartleys in the province gets nowhere; then someone phones back to say that Darren \u201cJR\u201d Hartley - or Big Daz - is working as a security guard, and passes on a mobile number.</p> <p>\u201cI met a woman and I wanted to start a family,\u201d Hartley says when he returns my call. He left the Irish Guards in 2005 and now works for Group 4. \u201cI didn\u2019t want them to be moving all the time and me being away, so I called it a day. I wanted somewhere they could call home.\u201d</p> <p>He was not only the first member of his family, but the first person in his village, to join the British army. \u201cI wanted to get away and we had got a sort of peace over here, so I thought why not join up and try to help other people who are in trouble.\u201d Now that he is back home in Northern Ireland, he is wary of talking freely about his previous career. \u201cSome people know - my mates and family - and they are fine with it, but it\u2019s better not to go on about it more widely. You still have to be careful.\u201d Many of the Irish Guards come from Northern Ireland and a few from the Republic; others, from the mainland and farther afield, tend to have Irish connections of one kind or another.</p> <p>Hartley\u2019s time with 3 Platoon seems a bit crazy now, he says. \u201cIt takes me right back when I see stuff on television about Iraq, and I definitely miss the craic of being with the lads... We were from all over the place, so being thrown together with all these different people was not what I had been used to back home. In the UK or on training exercises, we would go out at the weekends and got to know each other pretty well - we always had a laugh and a bit of piss-taking.\u201d But in Iraq, when the platoon was under pressure, often involved in 20 or 30 \u201ccontacts\u201d a day, he says the mood in the platoon changed.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a pretty serious time, so there weren\u2019t many jokes really. We were just supporting each other - when we got letters or food parcels from home, we would share stuff out or talk about what people were up to at home. Some of the boys didn\u2019t get letters, so it helped them.\u201d Hartley remembers his mother and sister sending him a message on forces radio. \u201cMy mum said hi and my sister sang me a song - Take Me Home, Country Roads, I think it was. I missed it because I was out on patrol, but the lads told me all about it and we had a laugh. It was that sort of thing that kept you going when stuff got a bit tricky.\u201d</p> <p>Days in Iraq melted into each other. \u201cWe were often going for 20, sometimes 24, hours at a time. Then we would try to grab a bit of sleep in the back of the wagon - the Warrior - maybe an hour or two before we were off again. I\u2019m 6ft 4in, so it was a bit rough.\u201d Hartley often catered for the crew - boil-in-the-bag ration packs of corned beef hash or lancashire hotpot - also in the back of the Warrior.</p> <p>One of the chief discomforts was the heat. \u201cThe highest temperature I remember was 56C, but mainly it was in the high 40s. It took a long time to get used to it, and we all spent a lot of time drinking water - and then peeing it out. I used to dream of finding a cold bottle of water on the wagon but because of the heat and the engines they were always warm.\u201d But what has stayed with him above all \u201cis the people and the shit they have had to put up with. I just think how lucky we are even to have stuff like running water.\u201d He recalls how the attitude of ordinary Iraqis changed as the tour went on. \u201cWhen we first went there, it felt like we were doing something worthwhile - the people would run up to us and cheer - but after a couple of weeks that changed. We had stuff thrown at us by Iraqis in the street.\u201d</p> <p>Initially the British forces prided themselves on their hearts-and-minds, helmets-off approach in Basra, which was so much less aggressive than their US counterparts in Baghdad. But over time, as welcome turned to hostility and militiamen loyal to the Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr began ambushing patrols and firebombing, there was a rethink. By May 2006 - three years after Bush declared victory - the British were calling a month-long state of emergency in Basra when more than 100 people were killed in sectarian clashes as a result of the occupation.</p> <p>Of the 34 soldiers in the picture, 14 have left the army. According to the Royal British Legion, this level of \u201cchurn\u201d - the number of soldiers who leave - is not unusual for operational units that have seen regular frontline action. Most of the others are still with the Irish Guards and based in Aldershot.</p> <p>The taxi driver who takes me from the station to the barracks says the arrival of the \u201cMicks\u201d (the Irish Guards\u2019 nickname) has changed the atmosphere in town. \u201cThe Paras could be a real pain, although they did police the town - they were the only ones allowed to cause trouble. The Irish Guards are different, good to have around, less bother.\u201d</p> <p>The 3 Platoon photograph is kept in the regimental album. A group who are still part of the platoon are waiting for me to talk over their experiences.</p> <p>Stevie King (second row, second from left) tells me how he got his first taste of war as night fell on April 6 2003. Holed up in the basement of a partially built housing complex near the centre of Basra, he was stuffing down the contents of his ration pack while others grabbed a couple of minutes\u2019 rest among the sand and rubble.</p> <p>\u201cI was only a pup and can say I was pretty scared - I can\u2019t see how anybody wasn\u2019t,\u201d says King, now 23. The unit came under attack from Iraqi snipers. \u201cThere was a bit of a commotion and we realised they were hitting us. We scrambled to cover and it went quiet again.\u201d What King didn\u2019t realise was that the short \u201ccontact\u201d had killed two soldiers from another Irish Guards platoon: 28-year-old Ian Malone and 20-year-old Christopher Muzvuru (Malone was from Dublin, Muzvuru Zimbabwean). They were among the first British deaths of the war. Five years later, King haltingly recalls the moment he found out what had happened. \u201cIt was devastating. It was a couple of hours later and we were taken to a classroom in Basra University and told that the two lads had died - I think that was when we all understood this was for real.\u201d</p> <p>King was one of the youngest soldiers involved in the invasion. On March 12, he celebrated his 18th birthday practising room clearances in Kuwait, where UK forces were stationed before crossing into Iraq. A few days later, he joined the rest of the platoon on the road to Basra.</p> <p>\u201cOnce I had my 18th birthday, I was eligible to go in. If we had moved before March 12, I would have had to stay behind because I was too young.\u201d</p> <p>When they reached Basra, King worked alongside platoon sergeant Ian \u201cPicky\u201d Pickford. \u201cI was just his bitch really,\u201d King says. \u201cThe sergeant always comes up from the rear and picks up the enemy or the wounded, and I was helping him.\u201d</p> <p>He has no regrets. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t swap what I learned in Iraq for anything. I still love the army, and that tour meant I had to grow up very fast. I went out there an older boy but came back a man.\u201d</p> <p>Stephen \u201cSammi\u201d Slater (middle row, third from right) had a grandfather, a great-grandfather and a host of uncles who had served in the armed forces, and his father had a career in the police. \u201cSince I was very little, I knew I wanted to be a soldier,\u201d he says. Iraq was his first tour and \u201ca proper eye-opener. I got shot at a few times. I hit the ground and hoped,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cBefore we went into Basra, we were based outside the city, making raids and coming out again. When we were coming back, I had got out of the wagon and an Iraqi tank aimed at it but missed - the shell landed about 10ft from where I was standing. I wasn\u2019t injured, but I was covered in lots of dust. The rest of the lads were behind a wall and all came running round asking, \u2018What\u2019s happened? What\u2019s happened? Are you all right?\u2019 but I was fine - maybe the odd scratch, but that was it.\u201d</p> <p>Slater laughs easily, especially at the recollection of his mates thinking he had been hit by a shell. All the same, it\u2019s the kind of thing you never forget, he says. When he came back from Iraq, his family and friends began to treat him differently. \u201cI used to be pretty quiet, but when I came back I started being more open. I\u2019ve been to Northern Ireland and then back to Iraq last year, but it was never like 2003. The excitement of being on the frontline and being exposed like that is something that will stay with me.\u201d</p> <p>Craig McDougall (front row, far right) recalls the day the portrait was taken. \u201cWe just sat down, got the photo took and then cracked on with our next patrol,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can see by the boys\u2019 faces that everybody is properly knackered, everyone looks like they have been working, but I like it for that - it\u2019s real.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe platoon commander was a bit crazy, a bit gung-ho, and he was always trying to push the wagons closer and closer to Basra,\u201d McDougall says. \u201cIt was a good laugh sitting in the back of the wagon hearing the rounds bouncing off the side and RPGs hitting the back doors. It\u2019s the best tour I\u2019ve done because there were very few rules or regulations out there. Now it is governed by rules and all that, and the situation has changed with suicide bombings and different tactics. Back then, there was a standing enemy who would take us on and we would take them on. There were no IEDs [improvised explosive devices] or suicide bombs - it was like good old-fashioned fighting, basically.\u201d</p> <p>When 3 Platoon returned from Iraq in summer 2003, they were given a couple of weeks\u2019 rest before setting off on a four-month tour in Northern Ireland. Then it was back to barracks in Aldershot for training, courses and preparation for the next trip. Three and a half years later, in 2007, the platoon served its second tour in Iraq. It was later that year that British troops withdrew from central Basra and made their base at the airport: they handed over security to the Iraqis and their role now is to train Iraqi troops.</p> <p>Noel Kerr (middle row, fourth from right), 30, served on both trips. \u201cThe second time we went, people didn\u2019t want to know you and were very hostile - the first time the kids would be coming over and talking to you, but this time they would stand back and sometimes throw things at you.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan \u201cRobbo\u201d Robinson (second row from back, far right), 31, now works as a recruiting sergeant at Belfast\u2019s Palace Barracks. \u201cBeing soldiers, particularly young soldiers who had never seen action, going to war was what we wanted to do more than anything. It is what we had joined up for.\u201d But as they gained first-hand experience of combat, the soldiers\u2019 attitude changed. \u201cWhen the two soldiers were killed, I think most of us realised that war is different from what you see in Hollywood - it came home just how real and dangerous it is. That you need to take it seriously, be properly trained and respect what you are doing.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, tough as the 2003 tour was, it convinced many of the soldiers, some of them teenagers, that the army was for them. In his new role as recruiting officer, does Robinson spell out both the reality of war as well as the attractions of army life? \u201cI don\u2019t tell the kids any lies about what I\u2019ve seen. They\u2019ll ask, \u2018Were you scared?\u2019 and of course I tell them I was. And I say that I have lost mates in action, but I don\u2019t go on about it - my job is to get people to sign up to the army, so I don\u2019t want to scare the crap out of them.\u201d</p> <p>Not everyone who signs up adapts well to army life. Sebert Henry (back row, far right) went awol when the platoon returned to the UK in 2003. No one seems to have been that close to him. \u201cHe was a good bloke, maybe a bit quiet, but a reliable soldier,\u201d says one of his fellow Micks. And no one seems to have heard from him since he left; when I run his name past the MOD, I draw a blank.</p> <p>There are a number of S Henrys listed in his home town of Birmingham, but an afternoon of phone calls confirms none of them answers to the name Sebert. Then a breakthrough: someone passes on an old address where they say Henry used to live, in Oldbury, in the West Midlands. But as I turn into the street, I am confronted not by a row of terraced houses but by a McDonald\u2019s drive-through and a Sainsbury\u2019s supermarket. </p> <p>Later, I ask Moulton what he remembers of Henry and why he\u2019d go awol. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to understand,\u201d he says, \u201cthat if you are a young man, perhaps you don\u2019t want always to be defined by something that happened in your early 20s, so you take a deep breath, move on and create a new life for yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Most left the platoon in more mundane circumstances. Ivor Hill (second from back row, third from left) moved back to Northern Ireland, where he works as a tyre-maker. Twins Mike and Mark Blakeway (respectively, middle row, third from left, and second row, fourth from right) have returned to the Black Country, where they have both found jobs and partners. Andy McGill (second row, second from right) left the army to become an electrician in Ballymena, but has decided civvy street isn\u2019t for him and will rejoin the Irish Guards later this year: \u201cI miss the excitement, the tours and my mates,\u201d he says.</p> <p>When he does so, he\u2019ll bump into some of the old hands from his platoon, including Sergeant Richie \u201cStricky\u201d Strickland (front row, second from left). \u201cI remember sitting by a tank and writing a \u2018bluey\u2019 [a letter] to my girlfriend, and we were engaged by an enemy tank and it didn\u2019t seem that big a deal - I just got up and carried on, which seems crazy looking back,\u201d he says of his time in Iraq.</p> <p>Sitting in his office overlooking the parade ground, platoon sergeant Ian \u201cPicky\u201d Pickford (front row, third from left) says he has nothing but respect for his men. \u201cOn night patrols, sometimes you got lucky and got a quiet one. Other times you would be engaged and it could get rough. We had some really young lads out there with us, and I was a bit worried about how some of them would shape up, but I can put my hand on my heart and say they did fantastic... It felt like I had been revising for exams and had finally got to test myself. Looking back, it was every schoolboy\u2019s dream.\u201d</p> <p>But not for Adam Moran, the would-be army boxer. When 3 Platoon returned to the UK in 2003, like Sebert Henry he decided he had had enough of the army and went awol. \u201cI was out for four and a half years, and was doing well,\u201d he says. \u201cI was a foreman for a groundworking company and was getting myself together. But then, three months ago, I was caught on a spot check on a motorway.\u201d</p> <p>Moran, 29, who now faces a court martial, makes clear that it was everyday army life that \u201cdrove him mad\u201d, rather than his experiences during the 2003 tour. \u201cI could deal with Iraq, because although it was hectic and we were under fire, at least the day was mapped out, you didn\u2019t have time to think. What I couldn\u2019t hack was all the ceremonial duties and general army life when we got back. I simply couldn\u2019t stand it, so I left.\u201d</p> <p>If the court rules against him, Moran could be sent to military prison. \u201cI have pleaded guilty to desertion,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich is a pretty serious offence... I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen - they may even try to keep me in, but I hope not. Army life just isn\u2019t for me.\u201d</p> <p>And what of Basra, five years on from 3 Platoon\u2019s incursion? There were a torrid few months earlier this year, when Shia militias ran riot after the British pulled out. However, the Iraqi authorities regained control thanks to massive support from US forces, and by the end of March Moqtada al-Sadr had ordered his followers to lay down their arms. According to the commander of British forces in southern Iraq, Major General Barney White-Spunner, the city is transformed - the port and the property market are booming. Iraqis take a gloomier view, but most concede that there are no longer obviously armed militiamen walking the streets.</p> <p>As for 3 Platoon, they are still at Aldershot barracks, preparing for a tour of Afghanistan in early 2010.</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 23 November 2018 to remove an inaccuracy</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>It's the smells of autumn that help you come to terms with summer's demise, the prospect of shortening days and the winter to come. The overriding aromas in the garden are those of decay as countless organisms actively break down spent vegetation and return goodness to the soil. Not so much an end as a beginning, an essential part of the garden's cycle.</p> <p>This is the time of the fungus, myriad forms erupting overnight. Their musty, organic smell mingles with the rich, sweet aroma of ripe fruit: plums and figs fallen to the ground, crimson and russet apples, and the opulent, almost decadent, perfume of fat pears.</p> <p>All along the hedgerows and on waste ground, blackberries ripen and turn black, their warm fruit bursting, exuding perfume and attracting Red Admirals to gorge at the feast. In the background there is wood smoke.</p> <p>Garden smells also excite the senses, many of them rich and fruity, some exotic: ornamental gingers, hedychiums from the foothills of the Himalayas, turn on their perfume as dusk descends. Heady, rich and deep, it is designed to attract moths. Hedychium gardnerianum has the best scent.</p> <p>Hedychiums once had a reputation for being tender, but are much hardier than was assumed. Providing their tuberous roots are protected from freezing they will survive and go on and on. Once this would have been achieved by keeping plants in pots, but after experiment, more adventurous gardeners leave them in the open ground and protect them with a thick mulch. I mound up bucketsful of gritty soil over their tubers to insulate them and keep them safe, scraping it gently away at the beginning of May.</p> <p>Actaeas are used to plummeting winter temperatures and need no such cosseting. It is now that they come into their own, tall wands of flower wafting perfume over full-blown borders or mingling with autumn anemones and Cyclamen hederifolium in the shadier reaches. Actaea simplex and its numerous cultivars, some with fashionable dark foliage, is the one to go for.</p> <p>For those who yearn for a reprise of summer, try Amaryllis belladonna - crystalline-pink lily flowers with a delicious, ambiguous scent somewhere between a boudoir and a sweet shop. Let yourself down easily.</p>",
  "<p>My parents went through a very nasty divorce when I was eight and as a result I lost my way for a while: I got in with a bad crowd and spent a lot of time standing on corners, smoking or pedalling on my bike - anything but going to school. But when I was 12, my mum met Kevin Clancy and that was a turning point in my life. He was in his thirties, had a nice car and a really nice house and I realised that I wanted to make more of myself. </p> <p>He's a friendly, warm guy and is quietly ambitious and strong. It must have been a nightmare for him when he met my mum - he had his own business in Bristol and we lived in Huddersfield so he had to commute at the weekend to see her - and of course he had my older brother and me to contend with. It's a mark of his character that he took us on. He never took me to one side and said \"Don't do that\" or \"Do this\" - instead he led by example and exuded a strength of character that I admired. The penny dropped with me that I should knuckle down and I went back to school. He bought me my first bike, took me to trials and laid the foundations for my success. I'm proud to have his name. </p> <p>Another mentor in my life has been Dr Steve Peters, a psychiatrist who has worked with all of the British cycling team. He changed me from being a good amateur to being a good pro. I met him three years ago when I was struggling. I had had a pretty bad time at the Commonwealth Games and was ready to pack it in, but he made me write a list of things that made me happy and unhappy about cycling. The unhappy list was long: I hated travelling, sharing a room and the pressure at the beginning of a race. He taught me to be logical and ask myself a series of questions before a race began: Is there any reason for being nervous? Are you one of the best cyclists in the arena? And finally, that if all else failed, I'd given my best and there was nothing more I could do. </p> <p>My confidence increased tenfold and as a result I took control of my life - in effect I became my own boss and that was incredibly liberating.</p> <p>He's a very powerful and persuasive person and he looks right into your eyes when he's talking to you. He has a big personality but likes to keep himself to himself too and like me, is very much a home bird. He's changed my life in other ways too. I've definitely lightened up and realised the importance of having fun. There's no way the GB cyclists would have had the gold-medal haul they had without him. I wouldn't have had the success I've had if I hadn't met him. He's very much in demand now, which I'm delighted about because he's a really good guy. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> On September 21 Ed Clancy will take part in the Sky Sports London Freewheel. He was talking to Deany Judd</p>",
  "<p>Here is a cautionary tale for anyone working in research. \"Captain Cook and Lord Nelson seem unlikely figureheads in the fight against climate change alarmists,\" said the Sun. \"Lord Nelson and Captain Cook's ship logs question climate change theories,\" announced the Telegraph. Oh that's handy. So perhaps we can just keep on burning oil regardless then? \"The ships' logs of great maritime figures such as Lord Nelson and Captain Cook have cast new light on climate change by suggesting that global warming may not be an entirely man-made phenomenon.\"</p> <p>I spoke to Dennis Wheeler, a geographer at Sunderland University and the man whose research triggered this coverage. Is he a leading figure in \"the fight against climate change alarmists\"?</p> <p>No. \"But now I've had emails from cranks around the world thinking I'm some kind of anti-global warming conspiracy theorist and a friend to them. I'm most certainly not. The newspapers grossly and crassly misrepresented everything we are doing.\"</p> <p>In fact, Wheeler had spoken only to the Sunday Times, which covered his work accurately. The rest of the newspapers copied the quotes, and the information, but rather grandly decided to change the purpose and the outcome of his research. \"It was odd reading articles which were written as if a reporter had spoken to me - I wasn't fully aware of the extent to which the media copy each other's newspapers - but worse was the brazen way they distorted our work. Not a single one of the journalists from any other newspaper contacted us to see if their take on the story was correct.\"</p> <p>In fact, the journalists concocted all kinds of connections entirely for themselves. \"Ships' logs, and thousands more like them, have revealed that recent global warming is not so unusual after all.\" Is that true? \"No. As I pointed out to the Sunday Times, the ships' log books I work with only give us information about wind force and wind direction, they basically do not give us information on temperatures, and if they do it's very scant and unreliable. We've simply never claimed indirectly or directly to have any direct evidence on changing temperatures.\"</p> <p>More from the Telegraph: \"The records also suggest that Europe saw a spell of rapid warming, similar to that experienced today, during the 1730s that must have been caused naturally.\"</p> <p>Wheeler? \"Your heart just sinks. Well, the central England temperature series, for example, have shown us that the 1720s and 1730s are a period of fairly rapid warming, but that's in recovery from the Little Ice Age, and we'd like to know more about that, but this has been known about since 1974. What we are trying to do is to shed a fresh light - a bit of background - on these long-known changes in temperature.</p> <p>\"Somewhere at the end they do quote me, but by then the headlines have done their job, and the message is lost in the willingness of so many people to believe global warming is not a major issue. And by the end it was unclear what my quote meant anyway, in its new context.\"</p> <p>How did the papers quote Wheeler? Thus: \"Global warming is a reality, but our data shows climate science is complex. It is wrong to take particular events and link them to carbon dioxide emissions.\" I could see how that quote might get misunderstood. </p> <p>\"Only out of context. I wasn't talking about the scientific community, I wasn't talking about climate change theory being wrong, I was talking about the media and others getting things wrong. Any new weather event is currently explained away as yet another facet of global warming, but there has always been freak weather. Like most people, I find it hugely irritating when people draw too much from single events.\"</p> <p>If you're an academic and your work has been \"grossly and crassly misrepresented\" by the newspapers, then I'm always very pleased to hear from you. </p> <p>Please send your bad science to <a href=\"mailto:bad.science@theguardian.com\">bad.science@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Stepping up to microphones in the TUC hall were those authentic voices now almost entirely absent from Labour politics. Many, these days, are women, and they speak for the workplaces of the third of people whose real living standards have fallen over the last five years. When they tell of years of pay settlements falling below inflation, it's not an abstraction. When they call for a windfall tax and a fairer sharing of the pain of this recession, it's not a political idea of fairness, it's bread and butter. But they went back to their workplaces empty-handed.</p> <p>The windfall tax that wasn't now joins the long list of Gordon Brown's year of disasters. Were he firm of purpose and clear in vision, he could have said no right at the start, explained why and immediately prescribed this week's package. It wasn't too bad, with a freeze in the bills for 600,000 households and free cavity-wall insulation and loft-lagging for many. But why let speculation linger all summer? Why negotiate feebly for months with the companies and then cave in? What's more, why let the Association of Electricity Producers say \"inevitably the bill will to some extent end up with the customer\"? But here is the shocker: the Treasury now admits that the companies can offset most of the \u00a3910m cost of these schemes against corporation tax. Not only is this not a windfall, the taxpayer is paying. Meanwhile, the companies have already given 20% dividend increases to their shareholders. </p> <p>Expect a rebellion when the energy bill comes to parliament from the 122 Labour MPs now signed up to Compass's call for a windfall tax, alongside another revolt on 42-day detentions. More rattling of sabres came yesterday, when it was revealed several MPs had written to the Labour general secretary calling for nomination papers for the leadership to be sent out. These are mainly not the usual suspects (apart from Frank Field), but sober middle-grounders, such as Fiona Mactaggart, the former Home Office minister; Siobhain McDonagh, the whip sacked yesterday who had never, in 11 years, voted against the government; another is an NEC trusty. Here was the first stone thrown: ranks of others want a new leader but fear the turmoil to come. </p> <p>Every week, polls rain down hammer blows on Labour MPs and ministers, most of whom seem too stunned to act. Wait and see, something may turn up, is the prevailing mood as the party conference approaches. But Thursday's Channel 4 poll from YouGov gave a frightening picture of what's happening in 60 marginal seats - not those with tiny majorities that are bound to fall, but the next tranche, with majorities between 6% and 14%. YouGov found a swing that would deliver David Cameron a majority of 150. As for Brown, 59% rate his performance poor, bad or dreadful, and only 10% excellent or good; 66% say he is out of touch and indecisive; more than 50% say he is incompetent and gloomy. </p> <p>The number of Labour MPs facing obliteration ought to galvanise action, but as yet they seem more like self-harmers than self-preservers. So is it all over? Some Labour pessimists now opine with world-weary fatalism that there is a time and tide in politics - and Labour is reaching the end of some natural cycle. Some draw comfort from this sense of forces beyond their control: it relieves the painful need for action. But they should pay careful attention to this poll. Like others currently, it reveals something important. Cameron's victory is not certain - yet. He has not yet sealed the deal.</p> <p>Look at this: 55% call him a lightweight politician, while only 22% think him a heavyweight. As many say the Tory party is not competent to run the economy as say they are. Compare where Cameron stands with where Blair was 18 months from winning in 1997. Cameron scores 40% as the person to make the better prime minister (Brown scores only 22%), but Tony Blair at the same time scored a regular 70%. Peter Kellner, the YouGov president, says the Conservative party is still a toxic brand. Labour defeatists may think it's all over, so they might as well go down with the captain, but it's not so. Or not quite yet.</p> <p>Labour could have been in mortal peril from an attack on its exposed left flank, but the Lib Dem leader bends with the wind he feels blowing towards the Tories. It's a tactical error to go for the maximum number of seats now instead of playing the long game and repositioning his party. But Nick Clegg seems to have little appetite for marching his party towards the great acres of radical ground vacated by Labour. Imagine if they were now building on their Iraq war advantage, along with their natural winners on ID cards, 42 days and other liberal issues. Chris Huhne's excellent liberal policy on punishment and prisons points the way they could go. </p> <p>But Clegg seems to be heading plum into the squashed centre ground, squeezed between the other parties. They have dropped the eye-catching 50% tax on the rich. They would tax the rich more on capital gains and pensions to redistribute to the 90% basic rate payers - but the complex package lacks political panache to become the totemic battle flag of a radical party. </p> <p>He is just as eager to emphasise bribing middle England, and the shrinking of the total tax take, with a smaller state, proclaiming the end of social democracy. Worried about protecting south-west rural Tory seats and home counties territory, Lib Dems calculate seat by seat and miss the big picture. What are they for? There is no need for another centre party - not even a nicer one. An avalanche of Labour votes might have fallen to a party ready to outdo Labour on social justice. </p> <p>As for the Conservatives' new clothes as \"progressives\", where is the Labour ridicule and mockery? The muted ripostes seem to spring from a self-conscious sense of Labour's own vulnerability on too many fronts. If others steal clothes Labour seems to have discarded, it's hard to complain. It's hard to be the party of the poor after redistributing that 10p tax from the lowest paid to the middle. The party of fairness is a tough claim, too, when Labour has nothing to say about outrageous kleptocracy while the poor pay more tax than the rich. So Labour is silenced by its own errors, unable to land blows on the other parties until it shakes off the last terrible year and gives itself one last chance to start again.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Sir Alex Ferguson delivered a withering assessment of Manchester City's new billionaire owners last night when he dismissed as \"all talk\" the club's aspirations to establish a new Big Five and questioned whether the top players would want to join Robinho at Eastlands, regardless of the vast sums of money on offer.</p> <p>The Manchester United manager cited Dimitar Berbatov's blunt refusal to entertain the idea of moving to City on transfer deadline day, instead signing at Old Trafford for \u00a330.75m, and he acknowledged Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's complaints about the manner in which the Abu Dhabi United Group have already revealed their \"fantasy football\" signings, a list that includes Cristiano Ronaldo, Cesc F\u00e1bregas and Fernando Torres.</p> <p>\"There's plenty of talk from them but I disregard it really because it is all talk,\" said Ferguson. \"We've seen it before and it will happen again. There's been a lot of talk at City but when it comes down to getting players they may find it difficult. They have talked about getting Cristiano Ronaldo, which is absolutely absurd.\"</p> <p>Ferguson rarely resists the temptation to remind everyone at the \"Temple of Doom\", as he calls the City of Manchester Stadium, about United's dominance and, perhaps being deliberately provocative, he made a comparison between the modern-day City and one of the sport's most expensive, and ultimately unsuccessful, experiments. \"History tells you something,\" he said. \"Sunderland, in the 1950s, were relegated despite having the most expensive team in the country - the Bank of England team, with every player bought for astronomical sums. You can buy 11 players and still not have a team.\"</p> <p>Ferguson was talking on the day that it emerged that City's new owners plan to buy a huge area of land around their stadium to develop other facilities and build a training ground. Garry Cook, City's executive chairman, has spoken about becoming \"bigger than Manchester United\" and the club also want to branch into financial services, the fashion industry, telecommunications and even open fast-food stores and bring out a range of cars and scooters, the aim being to become \"the Virgin of Asia and the world\".</p> <p>Ferguson, however, scoffed at Mark Hughes's claim that City's game against Chelsea today is now bigger than United's at Liverpool. \"I'm going to check what he had for breakfast,\" he said of the former United player. \"Something must have upset him. I said to [United's chief executive] David Gill today, 'Check how many games he [Hughes] played for us against Liverpool, will you?' Liverpool versus United is always the biggest game.\"</p> <p>It was put to Ferguson that City regard themselves as potential Champions League winners within three years. \"It depends how much money they are willing to throw at it to get the star players,\" he responded. \"But we're not worried. What you see at Manchester United is not an overnight situation. Our club has been built up over many years. We're not just here for today; we're going to be here for a long time. No matter where the challenge comes from, we'll still be here.</p> <p>\"We play the same way, have the same ambitions, we keep our feet on the ground, everyone has a humble approach and we shouldn't concern ourselves with what other people are planning to do because it doesn't always work. Yes, we've bought big players but I don't think you can see a cash cow from Manchester United in a way that could happen elsewhere, the way some clubs are talking.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Amy Winehouse</h2> <p><strong>Sylvia Young theatre school, London, 1997-1998. Sylvia Young, headteacher</strong></p> <p>Amy arrived for her scholarship audition at 12, rather shy and a bit apprehensive. Then she sang and all that was forgotten. She lit up the room, her voice was so rich and pure. I still have our comments on her audition: \"Very mature, big sound, excellent technique.\" I've always said she's a cross between a young Judy Garland and Ella Fitzgerald. </p> <p>Academically, Amy was extremely bright - her English teacher thought she would be a journalist or novelist because she was such a gifted writer. I think it was because she was so clever that she got bored so quickly. And when she was bored, she would misbehave. Never anything serious or malicious, never drugs or alcohol; she was just disruptive.</p> <p>We've kept in touch. I don't ask about her personal life, although I am sad that she should be miserable and troubled. I would never have expected it - she seemed such a nice, strong person. </p> <h2>Jude Law</h2> <p><strong>Alleyn's school, London, 1986-1989. Mike Jones, housemaster</strong></p> <p>Jude joined us at 14. He'd been at Crown Woods comprehensive, where he'd been bullied, so he came to us late. He didn't know anybody but it didn't faze him, he just hit the ground running, which shows his confidence. He quickly became involved in acting, and got rave reviews in the school magazine for some of the plays he was in. He was certainly bright, but some teachers weren't keen on his arrogance. He used to toe the line, but he was never afraid to give you his opinion if he felt he'd been treated unfairly. He wasn't that popular with some of his contemporaries, either. He was such a polished character, and they felt he thought a lot of himself. Some boys were jealous of the fact that he was quite popular with the girls, too. </p> <h2>Simon Cowell </h2> <p><strong>Dover college, Kent, 1973-1975. Lorenzo Smerillo, former assistant housemaster</strong></p> <p>Simon was a very unhappy, nicotine-addicted, skinny, scruffy, dishevelled, pimply teen - rather like most boys at any school. I found him amusing in a quirky way. He quite often had some wisecrack or other on the tip of his tongue. He was admired by some of the boys after he left school with his O-level or two because he got a job as a mail boy at some London record company. He has become quite pudgy from what I saw once on the box, and still does not know how to dress, but his sardonic wit is leaven to the morass of TV idiocy.</p> <h2>Damien Hirst</h2> <p><strong>Allerton Grange comprehensive, Leeds, 1976-1983.David Wood, art</strong></p> <p>Damien had some spirit. He didn't accept things as they were. If I'd only known at the time that he was going to make it really big, I'd have stashed away all his drawings, but you couldn't have said when he was doing his O- or A-levels that here was someone who would shake the art world. Some of his ideas were good and, as I look back, a little bit off the wall, but his work didn't stand out. It's been said that underlying Damien's work is a concern with death or the progress towards death. On one occasion I was getting the sixth form to discuss all sorts of things: music halls, puppets, ghosts. We'd been talking about music-hall jokes, the old-fashioned \"Why did the chicken cross the road?\" ones. Later, someone said to Damien, \"What's the purpose of life then?\" and he said, \"To get to the other side.\" I thought, you shrewd monkey.</p> <h2>Lily Allen</h2> <p><strong>The Cavendish school, London, 1996-2000. Rachel Santesso, music</strong></p> <p>I was 20 and had just moved to London when I met Lily. She was 11 and she came shuffling into my music room. The kids sat on the floor while I taught them from the piano, and Lily stood out because she looked so disgruntled. She had short, messy hair, huge, melancholy eyes and a tomboyish appearance. Sometimes I'd walk into the office and find Lily sitting there with a world-weary look on her face, waiting to be told off yet again.</p> <p>One day, I heard Lily singing Wonderwall to herself. I asked her to come in at lunchtime for singing lessons, and that was when I discovered how truly talented she was. Along with her beautiful voice, she was extremely musical and had an innate sense of phrasing and rhythm. When she finally performed at a school event, she made the audience cry. Afterwards, as everyone swarmed to congratulate her, I saw a look of sheer happiness on her face. </p> <h2>Boris Johnson</h2> <p><strong>Eton, Berkshire, 1975-1982. Colin Cook, geography</strong></p> <p>Boris wasn't in my class, but I knew who he was. He was an entertaining character. He was a scholar, and they have a special uniform, so he was in this white surplice, and he really didn't look comfortable. He had the mop of blond hair then, and shambled in the same way he does today. Some might have said he looked a scruff, but he was a very clever boy.</p> <h2>Matt Lucas</h2> <p><strong>Haberdashers' Aske's, Elstree, 1985-1990. Paul Hayler, geography</strong></p> <p>I came across Matt aged 11 because I used to run the school stamp-collecting club and he was a stamp collector. He was a live wire and a joker, and wore this blue baseball cap all the time because he lost his hair very early on. He stood out because of that, and he had the wit and good humour to go with it. </p> <h2>Thom Yorke </h2> <p><strong>Abingdon school, Oxfordshire, 1980-1987. Terence Gilmore-James, director of music</strong></p> <p>Thom was always small, physically - rather wiry hair, very unusual-looking because of his paralysed eye. That made him self-conscious, and he appeared to be rather forlorn and a little isolated. I don't think Abingdon was the first school where he encountered people looking at him, because he was unhappy before that and was probably teased a bit. But I think he found a haven in the music room. He loved to talk and express his opinions - if you ever got into an argument with Thom, it could be very interesting. But I don't think he had many people he felt he could confide in. He was a thinker and an experimenter. He wasn't a great musician - unlike Jonny [Greenwood, Radiohead's guitarist], for instance - although I think it's a slight exaggeration when he says he can't read music. He said he couldn't sing, but he has a great way of using his voice. People talk about the angst and alienation in his words. Over the years he's had to release all the frustrations within himself and the pain of the way he's been treated. He's a boy I think a lot of people didn't take much notice of, and of course now everyone does. </p> <p>When I hear songs like Sail To The Moon, I think back to the way Thom would sit there, hammering at the piano, lost in his world. We're still in touch. They invited me to the studio, but I'd feel like a usurper. It's no different from how it was when the teachers would gather outside the door listening. They couldn't play gigs in school because the head thought it was really quite dreadful and would pollute the boys' minds. So when the school asked them back to play a gig once they'd become famous, the boys very politely told them, \"FO.\"</p> <h2>Morrissey (aka Steven Patrick Morrissey)</h2> <p><strong>St Marys secondary modern, Stretford, Manchester, 1970-75. Aileen Power, English and art teacher</strong></p> <p>Steven had longish, curly hair, like an art student. I suppose he was reclusive, but the word that springs to mind is reverie - he was in his own world. I don't remember him as being opinionated and he certainly wasn't vociferous. But you realise that maybe things hit home that surfaced later on. I was and am very keen on the pro-life thing, and I showed the children pictures of aborted foetuses. Years later, he attended an anti-abortion rally, and obviously his revulsion for slaughter led him to champion animal rights. Steven had a soft, sonorous voice, and a couple of PE teachers said he was \"limp-wristed\".</p> <p>In The Headmaster Ritual, he sings about the brutality of his schooldays, but that's dramatisation. He was never in trouble, but the strap was used - probably too much. There was a coldness - if you were going to be punished, you went silently to the housemaster. It was quite brutal. </p> <p>Steven wasn't the cleverest, but he was a deep thinker. He had a feeling for English and literature, as well as for art. He had a sensitivity. I would have expected him to become a poet, but he surprised me with the music because we didn't have a music department. When he played at the Apollo, I wanted to find out what person he'd become. It was surreal, trying to link the artist with the reserved, seemingly strait-laced student. But perhaps he was always simmering, waiting to explode.\"</p> <h2>Tony Blair</h2> <p><strong>Fettes college, Edinburgh, 1966-1971. Colin Niven, French</strong></p> <p>I taught Tony French and German from the age of 13 to 16. He came top of the class in both, and I was delighted when he addressed the French parliament in French - a rare achievement for a British prime minister. His contributions to drama were very relevant to his political career. When he was 15, he appeared in Julius Caesar, playing Mark Antony, the supreme embodiment in Shakespeare of the subtle, skilled politician. Even then, Tony had this magnetic charisma and ability to sway people. He was a very gifted debater and won every round of the junior debating championship when he was 14. Some of the subjects that came up are rather interesting: \"This house would make smoking illegal.\" Of course, Tony did make smoking illegal. </p> <p>He was also a natural sportsman. I made him my cricket captain and I remember David McMurray, the master in charge of rugger, saying, \"Blair is the most courageous tackler I've ever seen.\" He didn't know fear and he'd hurl himself into the most terrifying situations. I thought he was very brave, because he'd suffered a lot of tragedy in his life, his mother having died and his father having had a stroke, and he was always cheerful. He had an engaging, slightly provocative nature, and an enchanting smile. The first ever girl to arrive at school was called Amanda McKenzie-Stewart; she was extremely pretty and clever and, not surprisingly, out of the entire school, she chose Tony as her boyfriend. At the time, he was very anti the combined cadet force, and very pro CND. That is an area where his views have shifted.</p> <h2>Damon Albarn and Graham Coxon</h2> <p><strong>Stanway school, Colchester, 1979-1986 (Albarn) and 1980-1986 (Coxon). Paul Nicholson, art</strong></p> <p>I taught Damon only a couple of times, but he was always around and I found him quite bigheaded. He was very popular, certainly with the girls. I'm not so sure about the lads. He was very confident, the sort of person who would think nothing of standing up in front of assembly and knocking out Guys And Dolls tunes. He was a bit of a poseur. Graham was the opposite - subdued, laid-back and very mature. They were very into music. Graham was always talking about the Jam and they'd go to gigs at Essex University. And they were both involved in school shows: Graham more bit parts and the music; Damon played the lead every time.</p> <h2>David Cameron</h2> <p><strong>Eton, 1980-85. Jeff Branch, English</strong></p> <p>I came across David as a young Etonian, aged about 14, and saw him for one tutorial session a week. He was outgoing, bright and generally enthusiastic - but then, most Etonians are. One couldn't say he stood out as a high flier. He was not necessarily a person one would expect to make a huge public mark. I remember Boris Johnson as well - he had an exuberance that was always likely to find a public outlet; that wasn't present in David.</p> <h2>JK Rowling</h2> <p><strong>Wyedean comprehensive, Chepstow, 1976-1983. John Nettleship, science</strong></p> <p>Joanne has said that no characters in Harry Potter are based more than 10% on any one person. I suppose the fact that I used to have long, black hair, is just a coincidence. To be honest, I think Snape, especially in the later books, is very like me.</p> <p>Joanne would have been about 12 when I taught her. Her days at Wyedean were pretty miserable. The school was like a prison, and then her mum came down with MS. Anne Rowling worked as my technician, and Joanne would come and wait at the science block for her mum so they could walk home together. It was obvious the child was very concerned about her mother - preoccupied. She was a very quiet child. I don't remember her ever answering a question - she would go to great lengths to avoid responding. I think she was tucking it all away in her head to use later in her stories. </p> <h2>Howard Marks</h2> <p><strong>Garw grammar school, Mid Glamorgan, 1956-1963. Alun John, chemistry</strong></p> <p>I taught Howard in the third and fourth forms, and always regarded him as a loner. He didn't stand out as being disruptive or a rebel. He had the basics of an extremely clever person even in those days. I never had to tell him off, and there were no signs that he was going to get himself into trouble. I was shocked when I heard what he'd done, but he's making a fortune out of it now. I think he's brilliant, for all the wrong reasons.</p> <h2>Salman Rushdie</h2> <p><strong>Rugby, 1961-1965. Geoffrey Boys, maths</strong></p> <p>I remember Salman on his first day because I walked into school with him. It was a cold winter's morning and he was a lonely little boy who'd just arrived from India. He was 13. All Rugbeians have a stiff upper lip, but he struck me as someone who was going to take a while to settle down. At the time we had a sprinkling of Asian boys, but he was noticeable because he came from a different background. My recollection is that he didn't distinguish himself at school in any dramatic way. I think he was an outsider.</p> <h2>Kate Winslet</h2> <p><strong>Redroofs theatre school, Maidenhead, 1986-1991. Carolyn Mayling, co-owner </strong></p> <p>Kate came to us when she was 11, and I taught her tap and modern dance until she left at 16. She had a burning passion for acting, and a sort of light behind her eyes. She wasn't fabulously good-looking but we always thought she was an extremely good actress. She played Wendy in Peter Pan, and the frog in a musical production of The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe - it was a dancing part and she was very good, in a green leotard and frog mask. She was very popular and the little ones adored her - we thought she might become a teacher. We made her head girl because she was a natural leader, and sensible. </p> <h2>Alex Turner</h2> <p><strong>Stocksbridge high school, Sheffield, 1997-2002. Mark Coleman, form teacher</strong></p> <p>Alex and Matt Helders [Arctic Monkeys' drummer] were in the same class. They were good mates. They were very popular. They were both bright, especially Alex. He was very good at English. Mr Baker, his English teacher, was very keen on words, on poetry, and I'm sure Alex must have got some inspiration from him. His lyrics are incredibly insightful. I didn't notice any strong interest in music, though. Sports were his thing. Alex was possibly the best in the school at basketball. When he was 14 he broke his arm in my PE lesson. He was in hospital for a week or so, and we had a whip-round and bought him a voucher for a CD, so there must have been some interest in music developing. They were ordinary, lovely lads who were a joy to teach. Everyone is very proud, and I get put on the guest list for gigs. Their fame was unexpected. They were never show-offs - when we had school talent contests, they didn't get involved. </p> <h2>David Miliband</h2> <p><strong>Haverstock comprehensive, London, 1976-1983. Oscar Gregan, maths</strong></p> <p>David should have got far better A-level results: it's no secret he got three Bs and a D. He wouldn't like me saying this, but he was head and shoulders over many students who are awarded A grades today. He wasn't what you'd call a character, but he was very articulate and had a strong presence. He showed brilliant attention to detail and great tenacity. </p> <p>He was outstandingly leftwing. I remember him being strongly against the invasion of the Falklands. In class, David was never lippy, but he could be demanding until he gained a clear understanding of the topic at hand. What I remember most was his perseverance and ambition. I remember a couple of people saying, \"He'll be prime minister one day.\"</p> <h2>Ricky Gervais</h2> <p><strong>Ashmead school, Reading, 1972-1979. Tony Burford, English</strong></p> <p>Everyone knew Ricky. He was the same at 17 as he is now. He'd say things that would make you cringe. He wouldn't do a voice, but would take on the persona of someone with bizarre or un-PC opinions. I knew he was joking, but I had the feeling that if someone heard him at the next table, they'd think he was awful. I was at once amused and terrified by him.</p> <h2>Paula Radcliffe</h2> <p><strong>Sharnbrook upper school, Bedfordshire, 1987-1992. Vaughan Caradice, maths</strong></p> <p>Paula was an outstanding individual. I taught her A-level maths and thought she'd apply to Oxbridge. She was extremely academic, but in the end she went to Loughborough for the athletics. </p> <p>She was 16 and had just become the world junior cross-country champion. She trained before and after school, but never skipped homework. Even your better students will have an off day, but I don't recall Paula ever missing a deadline. That's why she's achieved what she has. Obviously she didn't have a normal teenage life, but she had friends and was sociable. </p> <p>I recall once that I was doing an exam question on the board when Paula said very kindly and gently, \"You might want to have another look at that.\" When Paula says that, you have another look - and she was right: I'd made a mistake. </p> <h2>Andrew Flintoff</h2> <p><strong>Ribbleton Hall high school, Preston, 1988-1993. Cliff Antcliffe, English</strong></p> <p>I had a classroom that overlooked the sports field and I remember, just after he'd joined the school, watching this little boy batting. When they're young, the boys all crowd around the bat, but as I watched I could see the fielders moving farther and farther out as Andrew hit the ball harder and harder. He was always a very talented cricketer, but he was also level-headed. He went on the under-19s tour to South Africa just before his GCSEs, and I remember him saying, \"It's going to be really difficult doing my exams, but I'll do my best because cricket might not happen for me.\" He was a solid, average student. He still comes up to Preston to see his grandma. He was a really nice lad. </p> <h2>Nigella Lawson</h2> <p><strong>The Godolphin &amp; Latymer school, London, 1976-1978. Bill Vellutini, English </strong></p> <p>She was very attractive: a mass of hair, a figure - although not as voluptuous as now. She was also clever, charming and really with it. She loved to talk in class - the sort of natter that goes on behind the teacher's back. Nigella came from a moneyed background, but she never flaunted it. She loved French and I thought she'd do something with languages. There was no indication she'd end up in food. </p> <h2>U2</h2> <p><strong>Mount Temple comprehensive, Dublin, 1971-1978. Dr Albert Bradshaw, music</strong></p> <p>Bono was always wildly enthusiastic about anything he undertook. He threw himself into it 300%. Musically, they were only learning their trade, but they had their own ideas. They were individualistic. Although they were kids, they worked frantically hard rehearsing. The principal gave them permission to use a room to practise in. I remember hearing a crowd of kids outside one Wednesday. They were giving a performance in the schoolyard. You see children with a great passion, but then life moves them in different directions. They kept on with it.</p> <h2>Daniel Craig</h2> <p><strong>Hilbre high school, Wirral, 1979-1984. Hilary Green, drama</strong></p> <p>My fondest memory of Daniel is his performance as one of the ugly sisters in Cinderella. It was a delight to see a young man who could exhibit such power and maturity on stage, letting his hair down and revelling in the comedy. He and his friend Richard, who was the other sister, had the audience in fits of laughter. Contrary to general opinion, most competent actors can make a reasonable stab at tragedy - comedy takes real talent. Underneath the tough exterior of 007, there is a tremendous sense of fun. \u00b7</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Interviews by Liese Spencer, Becky Barnicoat, Heidi Blake and Dave Simpson.</p>",
  "<p>The \"social scourge\" of excessive boardroom pay has prompted widespread debate in the European Union as workers see their purchasing power eroded by rising prices and low wage increases. European political leaders have demanded a legal and fiscal clampdown.</p> <p>Shareholders, especially retail investors, are pressing for greater corporate disclosure of remuneration policy - including links to performance and individual directors' pay packages - as well as votes on the issue at annual meetings.</p> <p>The pay debate has been exacerbated by the credit crunch, which has exposed undue risk-taking in the search for higher bonuses by highly paid investment bankers and high-profile severance packages for failed executives, deepening the sense of outrage in mainland Europe, which is culturally more egalitarian than the US or Britain.</p> <p>Even before Pat Russo, chief executive of serially loss-making IT firm Alcatel-Lucent, quit in late July with a contractual pay-off of up to \u20ac6m (\u00a34.8m), French president Nicolas Sarkozy had produced draft laws to curb such \"golden parachutes\".</p> <p>The Dutch government has introduced legislation for a 30% tax on bonuses of more than \u20ac500,000 and a 15% increase in employer's fiscal contributions to executive pensions, partly influenced by the multimillion pay-off for ABN Amro chief Rijkman Groenink. In Germany, where workers' pay rose only 4.3% between 2003 and 2007 as firms laid off hundreds of thousands of employees, Social Democrats are demanding a \u20ac1m ceiling on tax-deductible boardroom remuneration.</p> <p>It is the widening gap between boardroom and shopfloor remuneration in a deteriorating economic environment that is fuelling the furore. The growing evidence is that mainland European companies are following the lead of their British counterparts by setting executive remuneration packages, including stock options, at a level commensurate with global - not national - peers in an effort to retain and incentivise directors.</p> <p>Executive pay in the EU averages \u20ac5m a year. French chief executives are said to be the highest paid, with packages worth \u20ac6m after a reported 58% leap in 2007. A recent survey by the German DSW investor lobby found that German executive pay had risen 7.75% in 2007 to just below \u20ac3m, with Josef Ackermann of Deutsche Bank the top earner with \u20ac14m, though Wendelin Wiedeking of unlisted Porsche earned more than four times that.</p> <p>It is this degree of corporate generosity that prompted Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of the EU's euro group, to label it a \"social scourge\".</p> <p>Disclosure practices vary widely across the European Union despite a four-year-old non-binding European commission recommendation to increase corporate remuneration transparency on individual executive pay and remuneration policies as a whole.</p> <p>A European commission report last year found greater transparency had ensued but responses had been patchy, with only a third of member states enabling even an advisory shareholder vote on executive remuneration. In Germany, where only 40% of the top 30 firms in the Dax have remuneration committees and most annual reports detail only the package of the highest earner, even that stipulation causes anger among directors.</p>",
  "<p>I was sitting in a field. I was 17. I was watching a single bubble float across my field of vision and I didn't think, Oh, that's a bubble. I saw it as an object that could bring happiness.</p> <p>You can create great globes of beauty flying off your lips. The wall of a bubble can be 1,000 times thinner than a piece of paper.

The search could go on for ever.</p> <p>There are places in this country that want bubbles and places that need bubbles. Brighton wants bubbles. Swindon needs them. I once used a bubble gun during a traffic jam on the M1. People got out of their cars and started popping them. It was the happiest moment on the M1 ever.</p> <p>My father passed away and asked that his ashes were mixed into bubble solution and those bubbles sent off a cliff in Cornwall. It was very special. He worked in the City. It wasn't as if he was into bubbles, but the fact that he asked that was a massive affirmation of my career. Since then, my dad has become synonymous with the wind.

  "<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337550534\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/09/12/Alexis1111.jpg\" alt=\"Alexis Petridis - Prep Talk\" width=\"220\" height=\"310\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph by David Newby</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Newby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Recently, a friend and I went to see Vampire Weekend, the New York band whose schtick revolves around playing up their Ivy League background: performing songs about Hyannis Port and Provincetown, campuses and 17th-century architecture, posing for photographs in front of blackboards, making videos in yacht clubs etc. \"Can you imagine,\" asked my friend, \"what this band would be like if they were British?\" We exchanged horrified looks. Varsity toffs singing knowing little songs about formal hall and May Week and boatie dinners, posing for photographs in punts and in the porter's lodge. I'd give them five minutes before the audience that lapped up Vampire Weekend stormed on stage and tried to strangle them.</p> <p>There's a similar disparity in fashion. There isn't really a British equivalent of the preppy look, or rather there is, but it's the Hackett rugby shirt, cord jacket and deck shoes of the Bloody Good Bloke, and nobody apart from other Bloody Good Blokes wants to look like that. Conversely, preppy is a fashion staple - this summer, style magazines have teemed with shoots involving cable-knit V-neck jumpers, blazers and button-down shirts - but it never really goes away. It's long transcended its Wasp-y origins: not something you can say about its Brit equivalent, which remains the sole property of Sloanes. </p> <p>I wondered if all this was to do with America's tendency to cultural imperialism versus Britain's tendency to cringe at its own culture, then I realised it was more straightforward. The preppy look is about a mod-like attention to detail, the Bloody Good Bloke doesn't care or think about clothes. Which is why the preppy looks pretty good and Bloody Good Bloke looks bloody awful.</p>",
  "<h2>Laura on Lancashire</h2> <p>In the decade or so that we have known each other, Alice and I have found little to squabble about. We have lived together, worked together, DJed together; we have rejoiced in our shared love of strong tea, Girls Aloud-style dancefloor manouevres and a habit of listening to Kate Rusby's Blooming Heather when drunk. But there has been one thing that has threatened to destroy our mighty friendship: the fact that I hail from Lancashire, while Alice is a Yorkshirewoman. Some of you might be hard-pushed to say what differentiates the red rose county from the white, but there is in fact a long-standing rivalry between the two, much of which stems back to the Wars of the Roses, which began in 1455. Yes, if there's one thing we're good at in the north it's holding a grudge. </p> <p>So, after 10 long years of bickering, Alice and I decided to head back to our homelands to settle, once and for all, whose county is best. We would travel in style, we thought, motoring around in a 1961 E-type Jaguar and staying at each county's finest hostelries. But, in an isle not short on boutique hotels and fine dining, each of us would have to choose examples of cuisine and culture that were distinct to our native county. And if we still could not find a winner, we would have to fight it out atop the Pennines. </p> <p>Most people side-step Lancashire. It is, after all, a county that exists in the collective imagination as a grim, dark, sooty place, a jumble of suet and flat caps, pigeons and rickets. My mission was to show Alice that Lancashire is in fact a place worth visiting, that there is an exquisiteness not only in the landscape of my home county, but also in the region's industrial heritage; the mills and the mines may have closed, but what lingers behind - the factory chimneys of Blackburn and Burnley, the terraces, the canalways - have a strange beauty of their own. </p> <p>I begin by taking her through the Forest of Bowland, a designated area of outstanding natural beauty, and up to Pendle Hill, which has close associations with the Quakers (the movement's founder, George Fox, experienced a visitation from God here in 1652) and with the Pendle witch trials of 1612, when 12 people were accused of murder, 10 found guilty and sentenced to be hanged. It is a stunning part of the country with its leaf-shadowed lanes that wend up to the hill itself, and its views out over the region, that always kindle in me a feeling of flickering pride and warm nostalgia.</p> <p>Though many assume Lancashire to be in perpetual impoverishment, it actually has its fair share of glitz. For evidence you need look no further than the Ribble Valley, where the splendour of Northcote Manor and Eaves Hall have now been joined by Stanley House in Mellor, a boutique hotel with 12 fabulously decorated rooms, manicured lawns and an elegant restaurant, Cassis. Not far away on the outskirts of Preston, you'll find Whitestake Farm, a five-star B&amp;B with an holistic spa, offering pedicures, mud envelopments and a rather excellent aromatherapy massage. </p> <p>After all that frou-frouing, I decide that it is time to introduce Alice to some regional cuisine. People think northern food has little to recommend it, that we eat offal and tripe and stodge-soaked-in-gravy, but I take her to the Three Fishes at Mitton, one of three pubs in the Ribble Valley specialising in Lancashire fare. </p> <p>Later, with the light fading, we head to Queen Street Mill in Burnley. I love this place, a former cotton mill co-operative that ceased production in 1982. I don't think anywhere in the world could smell quite so distinctively Lancastrian to me; it's there in the damp of the cotton and the oil of the machines, in the scent of the engine cooling down and the dust that gathers in the factory corners. Though the looms stand silent now, the whole place seems to echo with the ghosts of these machines, and with the lives that hung so heavily on Lancashire's cotton industry. </p> <p>Friday night takes us to Heywood, for a Northern Soul night. Northern Soul reached the height of its popularity here in the 1960s and 70s, when people flocked to Wigan Casino and Manchester's Twisted Wheel to perform spins and flips and backdrops to rare soul records. There is still a thriving soul scene all around the north-west, with nights held every weekend, from the Monaco in Hindley to St Helen's Soul Club. I used to love going to Northern Soul nights when I was a teenager, and I wanted Alice to experience a taste of this too - to see people 20 years older than us wearing great billowing trousers, talcum powdering the floor and dancing the whippersnappers into a cocked hat. And as we watch, my heart swells and bobs with that same feeling I had looking out over Pendle Hill, standing in the weaving shed in Burnley, holding my eccles cake, its warmth and its grease pressing through the paper bag; that there is nowhere I love more than Lancashire. </p> <p><strong>Alice's verdict</strong></p> <p>I was going to give no quarter to our neighbours but, predictably, they got me at my weakest point: the stomach. It started with a bowl of fresh peas, still in their pods, and some Morecambe Bay shrimps at The Three Fishes (or, as our delightfully clueless taxi driver insisted, \"The Three Pigeon Kingfishers. Yes?\"), and I was theirs by the time I spotted the tray of eccles cakes in the window of the bakery on the road to Blackburn. </p> <p>But in the end it was two, quite different things that made me think a little portion of my heart could be left over the Pennines. The first was a post-downpour drive over Pendle Hill, where the witches lived, now skirted by sweet villages on either side, but topped with a proper stretch of blasted heath. The swifts were swooping and the sun shone through the rain-washed leaves, lighting them up like glass. </p> <p>And then, the Queen Street Mill in Burnley on another soggy afternoon. They were shutting up and the place was empty of visitors but while Laura did something Lancastrian with bobbins, a lovely man called Conrad ushered me through a door I hadn't noticed, into the weaving shed. My own patch of Yorkshire happens not to be an industrial one, so this felt thrillingly exotic. The walls were white and bare and cool, cloudy light came in through the skylights. Beneath them, rows and rows and rows of black looms sat. There used to be thousands in Burnley, Conrad said. And these, I think, are all that are left, just quiet and still, like they're waiting. I might go back and see them again some time.</p> <h2>Alice on Yorkshire</h2> <p>Let's face it, it's not like people don't know about Yorkshire. Stretching itself out like a contented fat cat across a good wedge of the north, there's plenty to know. But I can't think, if I didn't know it from the inside out, which one of its public faces would ever entice me across its borders. The grumbling Geoffrey Boycotts? Devastated mining towns? The strange dales'n'moors nostalgia of Heartbeat and Last of the Summer Wine? But I know there's more to it than that. It's pretty, but never merely pretty, because it gets wild out on those hills; it can be flash, but it'll kick its shoes off by the end of the night; I would concede that it can be a touch reserved, a mite self-satisfied, it holds its habits and keeps them close. But like anyone or anything who knows where it's from and what it's about, it's got plenty of soul. </p> <p>As we cross the border into Yorkshire, the sun comes out. And then goes in again. As we're driving over (or, rather, willing the tyres to cling on to) the bottom corner of the Dales, the beautiful views on either side of the road are obscured once again by the north's apparently default mix of swirling mist and sweeping rain. The sheep just stand there, looking stoic. But there's blue sky over the gentle dips and climbs of Nidderdale and by the time we hit Pateley Bridge people are heading for a stroll along the river, or up and down the high street, unaware there's a monsoon going on up the road.</p> <p>We press on to Harrogate, which some people like to describe as the Bath of the north (with a short \"a\", mind. I'll be having none of this \"Baaarth\" nonsense) on account of it being a spa town and the kind of place that likes to think of itself as elegant. It's a risky call. Harrogate can be seen as the worst of Yorkshire: conservative, a touch stodgy, a mite self-satisfied. But I love it for its Victorian Turkish baths, a lavishly tiled 19th-century take on Ottoman style, perfectly preserved. But there's nothing namby pamby about them: no tea lights or whale music. You're here to get wet and hot and dry and cool and that's it. </p> <p>And then there's Betty's tearoom, which could feel a touch cliched - with its white pinnied waitresses and potted plants - but doesn't, because they really, really mean it. Also, the cakes are ace. All of them, but we're here to eat Yorkshire curd tart, a curds, raisins and nutmeg confection, which you can get anywhere in the county and hardly anywhere outside it, unlike the Eccles cake, for example, which flashes itself about all over.</p> <p>Then we're off again, hurtling towards urban, heady Leeds, where the outfits are slick and so are the streets (it's raining again). Everyone knows about the Harvey Nichols, latte and loft apartments makeover of Leeds and I'm just showing off, really. Manchester isn't really in Lancashire, so Laura can't compete. </p> <p>We check in to Residence 6 - luxury serviced apartments in the old post office building - and swan about a bit drinking complimentary champagne before heading out, avoiding the squalls of hen parties. First it's Boutique where a delightful barman encourages us to let him create a drink for us which means we end up with something delicious made of gin and passionfruit that we will never be able to replicate. Then we move on to Room where, even though we're hopelessly late and the only people eating in a venue that obviously wants to stop being a restaurant and start being a club, the food is so good it stops me drinking cocktails for a whole hour. My starter is called beans on toast. It turns out to be some kind of crushed bean served with goats cheese on fancy grilled bread. That, I think, is the north, Leeds style. We retire to the downstairs guestlist-only bar to contemplate this over further cocktails.</p> <p>On Sunday afternoon our cake odyssey concludes with a slice of Botham's Yorkshire brack in the cosy cottage behind Staithes Gallery. (It's famous for its artists, Staithes, right back to the start of the last century. We're staying in the converted studio.) We're here because in Staithes you're as tucked into the top corner of Yorkshire as it's possible to be - a few steps down the cobbled street and you're wetting your feet in the grey North Sea, and the beck that cuts through the dark cliffs and runs past the bottom of the yard is the border between North Yorkshire and Redcar and Cleveland. I love this coast, how forbidding it is, and how fierce. And how people grasp on to it anyway. The village here is vertiginous, weather-lashed and huddled up. Sitting at the kitchen table with the kindling taking in the stove, the sound of a fishermen's choir comes in through the window, mingling with the gulls.</p> <p><strong>Laura's verdict</strong></p> <p>It was Staithes that did it. It was the kippers and poached eggs we ate for tea, and the rockpools cluttered with whelks, and the sound of the fishermen's choir and the slices of brack and the pints of Smuggler's Ale. It was enough, all in all, to make me reconsider my stance on the white rose county. The curd tart may not hold a candle to the eccles cake, and I'd sooner be out on the floor at a Northern Soul night than dolled up to the nines in some fancy Leeds cocktail bar, but Staithes, with its simple seaside beauty, was what convinced me that they're not all ne'er-do-wells on the dark side of the Pennines. </p> <p>The character of the local landscape is not so very different to that round Pendle, and the closer we draw to the coast, the more it glowers and the more I love it. The south does pretty and soft and hilly, but what gets me about the north, what makes my heart twist whichever side of the Pennines I'm on, is its hardness, it roughness; it's there in the skyline of Burnley, and in the way the Pennines shoulder those dark, dark clouds, it's in our pies and our pastries and our hard, flat vowels, and it's there, most definitely, in the houses of Staithes, clinging strong and white-knuckled to the grey coast of Yorkshire.</p> <h2>Way to go</h2> <p><strong>Getting around</strong><br>Summer Wine Classic Car Hire (01484 688244, <a href=\"http://www.summerwineclassics.co.uk\">summerwineclassics.co.uk</a>) supply a Jaguar E-type for \u00a3275 per day, or \u00a3620 for 3 days, then \u00a3165 for further days.</p> <p><strong>Where to stay</strong><br>Stanley House, Mellor (01254 769200, <a href=\"http://www.stanleyhouse.co.uk\">stanleyhouse.co.uk</a>) doubles from \u00a3165 B&amp;B.

  "<p>The Vertigo Years is an ambitious book - a one-volume assessment of the gravity-eroding, giddying sweep of European cultural, social, political and spiritual change that permeated the first 15 years of the 20th century. But Philipp Blom has pulled it off triumphantly. </p> <p>The vertiginous atmosphere of a tumbling prewar society - at the same time exciting and frightening - is described with atmospheric clarity. The combination of easily worn scholarship, fascinating character studies and fluent story-telling that is often very funny makes this a hugely enjoyable and illuminating book.</p> <p>The reader is invited to suspend all knowledge of the events of a post-1914 world and to follow Blom's own set task to \"unravel the world from within\". He begins by challenging an often-uncontested interpretation of recent European history - that the 20th century did not arrive until the outbreak of the first world war. By 1914, Blom argues, everything was already in place for the changes that would make the post-1918 world unrecognisable to a Victorian. During the vertigo years \"certainty became a rare commodity\", as Freud's work in identifying the power of the unconscious mind coalesced with the breakdown of European 19th-century confidence. </p> <p>Blom provides a simple thesis that the century began in its proper chronological context. War came only as a catalyst for permanent change to the already crumbling structure of Europe, rather than as an interruption to a mistakenly interpreted idyll. Just as the golden summers of the English Edwardian era were a figment of hindsight (most of them were rainy and damp), the political, cultural, social and sexual Europe of 1900-14 was as unsettled as the British weather.</p> <p>Each of the 15 years is given a chapter of its own that begins with one year-defining event. The gateway to the stupendous Paris exhibition of 1900 was dominated by a vast statue of a mature, buxom woman - optimism for a new century as well as a symbolic bluff intended to disguise France's national insecurities. In 1901 Queen Victoria's \"narcissistic, insecure, ambivalent\" grandson, Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany, closed his grandmother's eyes for the last time. Victoria was buried with her personal mementos and portraits, the clutter of a Victorian drawing room crammed into the coffin with her. Blom gives a deliciously appalling description of the excesses of the reign of her son and heir Edward VII - called by a contemptuous Henry James \"Edward the Caresser\" - who succeeded her.</p> <p>Intolerance runs like a poisonous seam through all levels of society. Descriptions of racial and religious bigotry, practised and defended in France after the deeply disturbing antisemitic Dreyfus affair, are followed in a later chilling chapter by the international conference on eugenics, the study of race control, held at University College London, in the heart of Bloomsbury's elegant leafy squares. Proposals for ethnic cleansing had begun. Xenophobia was already rife in England in 1906. The Daily Mail advised its readers to check the passport of a \"Swiss\" waiter in case he was in fact German. \"Over-curious hairdressers\" and silent cabbies were viewed as covert spies.</p> <p>Corruption at the highest levels was apparent in the shocking sexual persecution of the kaiser's influential, probably homosexual adviser and one-time friend, Philipp Eulenburg. The stark poverty and inter-societal misery and violence experienced by a Russian peasant coexisted with the court of the weak, indulgent and egocentric tsar. As Blom points out, it is remarkable that the 1917 revolution did not take place years earlier.</p> <p>The bloodshed of the first world war is put into context by the butchery of preceding years, masterminded from within but occurring outside Europe in various dependent territories. The atrocious treatment by the British of the Boers is matched by Blom's horrifying descriptions of the human rights outrage of the Belgian Congo. As the mendacious King Leopold spun stories to the press, his employee, \"The Keeper of the Hands\", recorded the tally of amputees punished for failing to deliver their daily quota of rubber. Although two or three heroic men spoke out in the victims' defence, men do not come out well from Blom's survey, which is, in part, a study in praise of women.</p> <p>The weakness, posturing, duelling and sexual ambivalence that affected men in prominent positions seem to be prevalent in every country and leads to the terrifying psychosis of Ernst Wagner in the penultimate chapter. Blom is fascinating on the sexual shifts by which men came to resemble women and vice versa. He recognises women as the pioneers of the new century in political advancement, in the arts and also in the sciences, with Marie Curie winning a Nobel prize. The essential drivers of change in the 20th century, Blom writes, were \"machines and women, speed and sex\".</p> <p>The Vertigo Years carries with it not only an unsettling reminder of the cyclical nature of history, of complacency and greed, but also of mankind's salvation through creativity and compassion. Blom is a writer equally at ease with \"the creative ferment\" and the political swirl of 1900-14, years from which enduring innovations in art, literature, music and science erupted. An exhilarating chapter on the speed generated by the many new means of transport and the botched attempts at the first electric chair is matched by descriptions of the influences of Nietzsche, Schiele and Picasso. The work of Stravinsky and Diaghilev for the Ballets Russes shocked and entranced post-Victorian sensibilities. Many of Blom's studies of characters both famous and obscure stand on their own as short biographies, including suffragette Mary Gawthorpe, Austrian dramatist Hugo von Hofmannsthal, and a wonderful study of the celebrity aura that whirled around the actress Sarah Bernhardt. </p> <p>The Vertigo Years is reminiscent of George Dangerfield's masterly The Strange Death of Liberal England, but Blom has expanded that portrait to cover the whole of Europe in a work of narrative history at its best. </p> <p>\u00b7 Juliet Nicolson's Perfect Summer: Dancing into Shadow in 1911 is published by John Murray</p>",
  "<p>Perhaps best known for his 1997 first novel, Ingenious Pain, which won the Impac and James Tait Black prizes, Andrew Miller has built up a respectable backlist without quite finding the profile and readership that his early success might have led one to expect. A diligent researcher with a sharp eye for detail, he specialises in emotional withdrawal: whether focusing on an icy 18th-century surgeon or a traumatised 20th-century photographer, he tends to settle on characters whose numbness is really a stalled response to powerful feelings - an inner conflict that his novels duly uncover and, to varying degrees, resolve. Miller writes well about the ordinary sadnesses that weigh on his seemingly affectless heroes, and his historical novels have an enjoyably playful streak. When depicting the near-present, however, he can be dourly portentous, bringing in material - the Rwandan genocide in The Optimists, for example - that is too substantial for his decorously low-key gloom.</p> <p>One Morning Like a Bird, his fifth novel, takes the downbeat style of his last two books to an unexpected setting: pre-war Tokyo. The central character, Yuji Takano, is a young man with pretensions to being a \"literary gentleman\", and his main problem, in 1940, is his father's decision to cut off his allowance. Yuji knows what his contemporaries are being sent to do in China, and has the measure of the nationalists running Japan: his father, a law professor, was drummed out of his job for holding democratic views. But the embattled Takano family can still scrape together enough influence to keep the sickly Yuji out of the army, so instead of keeping an eye on political developments, he spends his days drinking with friends from university, half-heartedly pursuing a hated neighbour's young wife, and fretting about his failure to assemble a follow-up to Electric Dragonfly, his poorly selling book of poems.</p> <p>Writing in the present tense and the third person, Miller sticks scrupulously to Yuji's point of view, which makes it hard at first to orient yourself in the novel's social world. Gradually, though, it's made clear that the reticence and formality that govern the Takano household have little to do with what Yuji thinks of as \"the curious western theory of Oriental inscrutability\". His distant father and housebound mother have been that way since the great earthquake of 1923, which took the life of his adored older brother, Ryuichi. Yuji has found a more approachable father-figure in the person of Monsieur Feneon, a French trader who runs a film club for language students. He's particularly impressed by Feneon's claimed ownership of a manuscript letter from Arthur Rimbaud, though he also takes a detached interest in Feneon's daughter, Alissa, the only western person of his own age he's met.</p> <p>The first third of the book sets all this up in a leisurely fashion. Yuji maunders around, attending family get-togethers and worrying vaguely about the indignity of writing advertising copy. Then, just as the reader is growing impatient with Miller's self-absorbed, passive hero, there are developments on several fronts. A dissolute publisher invites Yuji to write an essay on a fascist writer named Ishihara, who offers the young poet entry to a corrupt artistic circle centred on an ultra-nationalist general. Yuji spends a night with Alissa, treating her coldly afterwards and not noticing that his friend Junzo is in love with her. His hated neighbour is shipped back from China with a missing foot and stories of Japanese atrocities. And each neighbourhood is ordered to prepare for bomber raids - raids that, as the reader already knows, will eventually bring about even more destruction than the earthquake that haunts Yuji's family.</p> <p>Miller's old Tokyo is a densely realised environment. You're soon persuaded that he knows, say, which 1920s jazz records would be found in a dusty cupboard in a quasi-westernised home in the winter of 1940. His writing aims for leanness but frequently rises to a discreet poetic flourish at the end of a paragraph; although there are jokes here and there, the effect overall is rather clinically tasteful. As you'd expect, Yuji is eventually coaxed out of his prolonged emotional immaturity, and Miller writes observantly about the pleasures of early parenthood. But the novel's grand themes - the fallibility of the intelligentsia, the difficulty of living in more than one culture, the choice between art and life - sometimes seem like little more than intellectual grace notes. The war itself ultimately functions as a backdrop, and the over-neat tying up of Miller's plotlines makes his earlier obliqueness look mannered and evasive.</p> <p>His novel is also filled with sly references, some keyed to Yuji's reading, others more contemporary. At one point, Feneon departs for Singapore, where he plans to stay with \"a man called Farrell\" - an allusion to JG Farrell's The Singapore Grip (1978), a novel set in the same period. In contrast to Farrell's cartoonishly sketched soldiers, Miller's Japanese characters are densely believable, and his recreation of their world is a real achievement. At the same time, anyone who's read Farrell's book might wish that Miller had taken a few hints from it and let himself be funnier, messier, more full-blooded.</p>",
  "<p>French Connection, the struggling clothing group, said it was \"disappointed\" to see underlying losses more than double to \u00a35.4m as the company grappled with muted wholesale trade, an underperforming menswear brand and heightened levels of high street discounting and input costs.</p> <p>A strong performance in French Connection's own womenswear lines - comparable sales in Britain and North America up 8% for the six months to July 31 - was entirely offset by continued lacklustre performance from menswear and other lines. Like-for-like sales at the group's stores and concessions were flat.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in French Connection's wholesale business, orders for the spring/summer season had been slow in the UK, though they have recovered since the half-year. Margin was hit by slightly higher levels of discounting activity, particularly in the US, and a strong euro, which made it more costly for the group to source almost a third of stock. </p> <p>Underlying pre-tax losses, after stripping out the benefit of a \u00a31.9m property disposal, widened from \u00a32.5m to \u00a35.4m. After the decision to maintain a 1.7p interim dividend, the group's cash pile is \u00a334.8m - worth about 36p a share.</p> <p>Its shares closed down 1p last night at 64.5p. They were trading at almost 200p 12 months ago.</p> <p>Founder and executive chairman Stephen Marks conceded that half-year losses were disappointing, proving a drag on his turnaround plans. </p> <p>Analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort said: \"We think French Connection will be lucky to break even ... this year.\" Philip Dorgan, at Panmure Gordon, said: \"We foresee losses at the pre-tax level for this year and next ... French Connection should cut its dividend. We estimate that it should cut it in half, which takes the dividend yield down to the less attractive level of 4%.\"</p> <p>Chief operating officer Neil Williams noted that house broker Numis Securities was forecasting full-year pre-tax profit of \u00a3500,000. He insisted: \"We need to go significantly backwards from there if we were not to be paying the final dividend.\"</p> <p>French Connection made pre-tax profit for the year to January 31 of \u00a33.1m and paid a full-year dividend of 5p a share.</p> <p>Commenting on current trading, Marks said: \"Expectations are for a continuation of the difficult retail environment ... against this background growth will be difficult to achieve for the second half.\" The company hopes benefits from a new team behind the French Connection menswear business will result in a marked improvement in spring/summer next year. </p> <p>\"Whilst there is some light at the end of tunnel, progress is unlikely to show through until next year at the earliest as a result of the weakening consumer backdrop and margin pressures,\" said Kaupthing analyst Matthew McEachran.</p>",
  "<p>It was autumn of 1986 and I was 30 years old, happily settled with a successful career in engineering. I had no idea at the time, but I was about to enter a 19-year-period of unhappiness and bad luck. </p> <p>I was working briefly on a farm, while I moved house, when a forklift truck pinned me against a wall and broke my back. I found out later that the farmer's 12-year-old son had jumped on to the truck and lost control at the wheel. </p> <p>My back was so badly injured I didn't get up for a year. The pain was as intense as electrocution, prickling through my body like heat as my muscles went into spasm. I felt like a zombie; I'd wake each day, pop two painkillers and shut down completely. My parents would come in and try to make me more comfortable, and I would shout at them to go away. Everything made the pain worse. I demanded that they take down the photos of me as a child winning sports races that covered the walls. All I could think of was the exhilarating feeling of sprinting 100 metres - now I wouldn't be able to walk it. I couldn't bear to think about the life I would never know again. </p> <p>The final blow came when the council told me the housing benefit I had been on wasn't rightfully mine. I was presented with a bill for \u00a35,000 that wiped me out both financially and emotionally. The stress that followed triggered two heart attacks. A friend said to me, \"Ken, do you think you might be haunted? With all the bad luck you've had, it seems like it.\" </p> <p>When I was taken into hospital in 2005 and told I'd had a stroke, it felt like yet another wretched episode in the disaster that was my life. I was bedridden once more, paralysed down one side, with only a pad and pen to communicate. But on my first day, after writing a note to the nurse, I found my right hand wandering across the page. I've never been a doodler. The closest I'd come was copying a cartoon as a child, and I hadn't drawn since. That's why it was so strange. The act was unconscious; only when a nurse asked me what I was doing did I look down to see patterns all over the paper. </p> <p>From then on I was waking every night at 2am and drawing until dawn. I asked the doctor what was going on and told him that it didn't feel normal - that I'd never drawn before in my life but suddenly couldn't stop. He explained that very occasionally, following a stroke, a person's brain rewires itself to avoid the damaged area. Sometimes this can expose a new ability in a patient: in my case, drawing. </p> <p>I was told the condition would probably wear off, but back at home I carried on making pictures, this time on my computer. I'd never had the slightest interest in art in my life. I was a practical person, an engineer by trade, and now, suddenly, memories and thoughts appeared to me as abstract images. It's hard to explain what I was feeling. It wasn't an impulse, just something that happened. Drawing had become like breathing: something I did instinctively and without choice. </p> <p>In 2007, I heard about Second Life, the online virtual world. Inside, I discovered art galleries selling digital art for real money and I decided to show my work for the first time. They snapped up 12 pieces straight away. Two months later, someone contacted me saying they had bought two of my pictures online and wanted one in real life. The potential of what I was doing dawned on me. </p> <p>Now I'm a professional artist - in my first year I've earned around \u00a330,000. I have been contacted by multinational companies, including IBM and Java, who want my pictures for their offices. I've been featured in art magazines; got my work in five virtual worlds, and galleries across the north-east.</p> <p>Yet a bogeyman lurks in the background. I try not to think about how I would feel if I woke up and whatever skill the stroke left me with had fled. It would be like being picked up and dropped from a great height back in to the miserable life I was living before. </p> <p>I cursed the stroke at the time, but it has changed my life in ways I could never have imagined. For the first time I have interests and my self-respect is growing. A Dutch friend who deals art to big hotel chains said my work is unique and that I should never give up. I told him, I'm not one to do that.</p>",
  "<p>Batman unwinds in the Batcave, Iron Man chills in his billionaire's play pad and Superman relaxes in his Fortress Of Solitude. But where would you expect to find a group of off-duty British superheroes? Hiding out in the Post Office tower keeping watch over London? Working undercover somewhere? Or down the pub?</p> <p>For Electroclash, Timebomb and The Hotness, the capes populating ITV2's new sitcom, No Heroics, it's definitely the pub. As the show's writer and producer Drew Pearce explains, \"The pub is definitely a character. That's still where people in Britain hang out. It was very important to make it very British - somewhere like the Phoenix in Charing Cross Road, where it looks like it's got 50 years of history.\" </p> <p>The Fortress feels like the quintessential slow-pint British boozer, albeit one with a slightly more stringent door policy: \"No Masks. No Powers. No Heroics.\" After 10 minutes inside, watching Nicholas Burns, Rebekah Staton, James Lance, Claire Keelan and Patrick Baladi (a great sitcom cast who've been in everything from The Office to Pulling, The Book Group and Nathan Barley), it's easy to forget you're on set in Ealing Studios and not actually a capes-only boozer. </p> <p>Nicholas Burns (AKA The Hotness) agrees: \"I happen to like sitting in a pub all day in real life - unfortunately the drinks aren't real.\"</p> <p>It's only once you start looking around and spot the Shazamstell Light and Von Doomenbrau (\"serve chilled\") on tap, the bottles of Ozymandias champagne and Logan's rum behind the bar, or the packs of Stronts and Zarjazz smokes that it really sinks in: this is geek heaven, writ super-large. There are tons of little touches like this littered around the set, drawing not only on decades of American superhero comics, but also the 2000AD British tradition that's been absent from all the recent Hollywood blockbusters. A portrait of Grant Morrison (Pearce admits how much he's been influenced by his out-of-print British superhero series Zenith - \"It's the germ of it\"); an advert nodding to the mighty Alan Moore (\"A wonderful night for a Moore's\"); a mocked-up cover for a Pull List comic they've had made up, very much in homage to 2000AD. They're all details that might not get more than a second of on-screen time, but they serve as a kind of background dirt under the show's fingers (or at the very least, will give Pearce a very long list to run through on the DVD extras).</p> <p>As Patrick Baladi (AKA Excelsor: think a British Superman played as an obnoxious rugger bugger) puts it, \"Drew's very nerdy about it all!\" But it was important to Pearce, a lifelong comics fan, that this attention to detail rewarded fans without alienating casual viewers: \"One of the weirdest compliments I had for the pilot was from a friend. She said, 'I thought I was going to hate it because it's about superheroes, but it's more like Friends!'\"</p> <p>With a high-concept like \"off-duty British superheroes,\" he continues, \"the sell is as much to the audience as it is to the channel - why should someone find it or watch it? You go to all this effort to create this universe, and it might start and end with these five-and-a-half weeks of shooting.\" </p> <p>By opening and closing the episodes with the four main heroes back in their booth, No Heroics anchors the offbeat gags with the familiar. It's four people sitting in a pub, but with the added fun of watching The Hotness take a bus on his way to foil some crime; She-Force trying to hide her powers when she accidentally snaps the photocopier in her day job; or Timebomb using his flash-forward skills to sneak a blowjob in the Fortress loos (\"I'm looking forward to the alternate universe where they give a Bafta for the Best Gay Superhero Toilet Scene - I really think we've got a shot,\" Pearce adds). Like Friends or Cheers, every episode brings you back to a familiar place. Somewhere where everyone knows not just your name, but your powers, as it were. </p> <p>\"The interesting thing about doing genre comedy is how you satisfy on a genre level and how you satisfy on a comedy level as well,\" Pearce enthuses. \"Buffy got to take the piss out of itself and be entirely sincere - an amazing sleight of hand trick. That's why the mundanity of this is so important, the playing underneath it rather than playing over the top of it ...\" </p> <p>He points to Shaun Of The Dead as the best genre success of the last few years, suggesting that it was its uniquely British undercutting of horror conventions in tandem with a completely faithful understanding of the genre conventions that made it work. \"I think that's the way to get it made in the UK. It would be lovely to see us being able to own big, sincere one-hour shows.\" </p> <p>With a CV including everything from time on the Popbitch mailout, to the Face, The Big Breakfast, SM:TV and MTV's Bedroom Diaries, (as well as a sideline career as a \"failed country musician\"), it's probably no surprise that the underlying theme of Pearce's No Heroics is our obsession with fame. The characters - especially The Hotness - are all glued to Power Hour, a kind of E! channel for heroes. It's a theme that will be explored further if they get the elusive second series. </p> <p>\"British comedy is best when it's about failure,\" Pearce argues, \"it's an old cliche, but it's pretty much true. I love nothing more than watching an entire series of Entourage in a weekend, but Entourage would be so hard to do in the UK - you would just want to kill them all! It will be interesting to see how we'd navigate success if we go on, because success at the moment is represented by Excelsor, who is literally the biggest twat in the whole thing!\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>No Heroics, Thu, 10.30pm, ITV2</p> <h2>Clash of the titans</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong><strong>Electroclash AKA Sarah, played by Claire Keelan </strong><br>(A Cock And Bull Story, Sorted, Nathan Barley)</p> <p>Has the power to talk to machines.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong><strong>Excelsor AKA Devlin, played by Patrick Baladi</strong><br>(Moving Wallpaper, Teachers, The Book Group)</p> <p>He can fly.

The code then insisted banks offer comparable terms in old accounts to those on new deals with \"similar\" features, or switch the account to one with much the same terms. </p> <p>If there was no account, banks were tasked to contact account holders to offer help in switching to superior savings. Account holders could complain to the ombudsman, while the Banking Code Standards Board would reprimand banks - in 2000 Bristol &amp; West, now part of Bank of Ireland, got into trouble for failing to keep the interest rate on \u00a315.5m of savings in superseded accounts at the same level as a similar account in its current range.

  "<p>The National Black Police Association is threatening to run a public campaign urging ethnic minorities to boycott the Metropolitan police in an escalation of the race row engulfing the force.</p> <p>Leading members have drawn up battle plans after a week in which the internal disputes of the Met have spilled out in public in a bitter war of words. The NBPA told the Guardian it is planning a march on Scotland Yard of black and Asian officers from across the country, a vote of no confidence in the management and a campaign warning young would-be officers from diverse backgrounds not to join the Met.</p> <p>The move came after Sir Ian Blair, the Met commissioner, temporarily relieved assistant commissioner Tarique Ghaffur, the most senior ethnic minority officer, of his duties. Ghaffur is suing the Met for racial discrimination.</p> <p>Last night the Metropolitan Police Authority announced it was investigating Commander Ali Dizaei, the president of the NBPA, for misconduct after allegations that he had helped the legal team defending a woman from a Met prosecution for death by dangerous driving.</p> <p>Dizaei denied any wrongdoing. \"They want to put me under investigation to put me under control.

  "<p>It is one of Michelangelo's most famous sculptures. Moses sits with the tablets of stone tucked under his right arm, a rope of thick beard between his fingers. But there is a curious feature. From the lawgiver's forehead protrude two tuber-like objects, small horns that seem like an incongruous loan from some pagan deity.</p> <p>According to the Bible, when Moses descended from Mount Sinai for the second time, the skin of his face was glowing. The Hebrew verb karan comes from the noun keren, which can mean either a ray of light or a horn. And in the fifth-century Latin Vulgate translation the face of Moses is described as cornuta (horned), hence Michelangelo's depiction.</p> <p>But there is a dark side to such imagery. Among the credulous it would have reinforced the stereotype of Jews as the devil's brood. The poet Ruth Fainlight wrote a poem, Horns, based on an experience in a Welsh village during the second world war when other children tried to look for her horns. More recently, Sacha Baron Cohen, in the guise of Borat, satirised the tradition by singing a song with the lyrics: \"Throw the Jew down the well... You must grab him by his horns.\"</p> <p>The horns of Moses represents one of the more egregious examples of a translation error. Our knowledge of religions often derives from translations of their sacred texts, but these do not always convey the exact meaning of the original.</p> <p>The sixth of the Ten Commandments is often quoted as \"You shall not kill,\" following the version in the King James Bible. But the English goes beyond the actual Hebrew. As the American scholar Robert Alter notes in his translation of the Torah, \"the Hebrew verb ratsach means murder, not kill, and so the ban is specifically on criminal acts of taking life\".</p> <p>Even a faithful translation can lead to misconceptions. The saying \"an eye for an eye\" - first appearing in Exodus - is commonly cited as evidence of a supposedly primitive Old Testament revenge ethic. According to Jewish tradition, however, the formula was never taken literally, and rather lays down a civic system of monetary compensation for injury, as elaborated in the Talmud. Maimonides, the influential medieval authority on Jewish law, observed that, from the time of Moses, no rabbi ruled that a man who blinded another should in turn be blinded himself. To treat \"an eye for an eye\" literally is to distort Judaism, at least as it has been practised for some 2,000 years.</p> <p>A translation beguiles us with the promise of instant access to another culture. But the bare text is insufficient without knowing how it is to be interpreted. It should be read in conjunction with a commentary familiar with the nuances of the original language and the traditions of exegesis. Otherwise there is a risk of making snap judgments based on flimsy knowledge.</p> <p>If, say, I want to look up what the Qur'an says about Jews or Christians, in no time at all a search of an online concordance will produce a series of references, But a string of isolated verses will leave me little the wiser if I don't know the context in which they were written, how they have been interpreted historically, and - especially - how they are elucidated now.</p> <p>It is well to remember that the meaning of a text is not necessarily set in stone and scope remains for reinterpretation. Some, for example, argue that the principle in Leviticus of loving one's neighbour is a tribal sentiment applying only to fellow Israelites. It occurs in the context of a set of social laws that refer variously to \"your brother\" and \"your people\" - while also including the injunction to love the resident \"stranger\". (On the other hand, a verse in Exodus which clearly indicates a fellow Israelite uses a different word for \"neighbour\" from that in the Leviticus passage.) </p> <p>Ultimately, the original connotations of \"neighbour\" remain a matter of scholarly debate, but there are certainly strands in classical rabbinic thinking that allow a broader definition to emerge. Alter is clear - he translates the line to: \"And you shall love your fellow man as yourself.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Simon Rocker is a journalist with the Jewish Chronicle</p>",
  "<p>Questions were raised yesterday about Robert Mugabe's commitment to Zimbabwe's historic power-sharing deal after it was revealed that hours before agreeing to a coalition administration with his arch foe, Morgan Tsvangirai, the president told traditional chiefs he could never work with the opposition.</p> <p>The revelation came as the two sides attempted to hammer out the composition of a coalition cabinet ahead of a formal signing of the power-sharing agreement on Monday that is expected to end the Zimbabwean leader's 28 years of political domination.</p> <p>Mugabe, Tsvangirai and the head of a smaller opposition faction are wrangling over the division of 31 cabinet seats.</p> <p>Sources in Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) said the party expected to secure control over the police and intelligence agency - which were central to the state-orchestrated campaign of killings and other violence against the opposition during the recent election - while Mugabe's Zanu-PF will oversee the military through the defence ministry.</p> <p>Such an arrangement could prove crucial to the MDC which plans to force fresh elections in about two years, laying the path for Mugabe's final political demise as it appears unlikely he could ever again win a legitimate ballot in Zimbabwe.</p> <p>But Mugabe's commitment to the deal was swiftly called into question when it was revealed that hours before agreeing to the power-sharing arrangement he told a meeting of traditional chiefs that the MDC and Zanu-PF \"will never mix\".</p> <p>\"Putting Zanu-PF and the MDC together to work together is like mixing water and fire,\" he said. \"It is quite difficult for these parties to be friends especially if one party is being supported and sponsored by the outside countries that are pushing for a regime change agenda. They want Mugabe to go.\"</p> <p>If Mugabe does sign the coalition agreement on Monday, the allocation of portfolios will help determine how much power he continues to wield as president. But his grip will in any case be greatly weakened, with Tsvangirai destined to take over the daily running of government as prime minister and the combined opposition holding a majority in cabinet, albeit by only one seat.</p> <p>Mugabe will chair the cabinet while Tsvangirai heads a new council of ministers that will undertake the daily administration of the country.</p> <p>The combined opposition's majority in both bodies means Mugabe and his party can be outvoted in government and parliament, further whittling down the president's political control provided the two MDC factions work together. But that may prove difficult given the animosity between Tsvangirai and the leader of the rival MDC grouping, Arthur Mutambara, who is to serve as one of two deputy prime ministers.</p> <p>Perhaps crucially, the MDC also won its demand for the negotiation of a new constitution within 18 months which will lay the ground for fresh elections.</p> <p>In the meantime, the new administration will face formidable challenges.</p> <p>Desperate Zimbabweans are looking to a new government for relief from hyperinflation running above 20 million percent, widespread food and fuel shortages, and mass unemployment.</p> <p>David Coltart, legal affairs secretary for the smaller MDC faction, said the additional challenge for the new government would be for former foes to work together.</p> <p>\"The grave humanitarian and economic crises are enough to test any government. The new cabinet that will have to address these challenges is composed of protagonists - virtually all of the cabinet ministers to be appointed by the MDC [factions] have at some stage in the last nine years been brutalised on the instructions of those they will now have to work with. Zimbabwe remains highly polarised and it will take statesmanship on all sides to make this work,\" he said.</p> <p>Many in the MDC also remain deeply hostile to Mugabe, reflected in the jeering of its MPs as the president opened parliament last month.</p> <p>The agreement has met with scepticism from some of Mugabe's opponents who have accused Tsvangirai of making too many concessions.</p> <p>Lovemore Madhuku, head of the National Constitutional Assembly, which has been at the forefront of pressing for political reform, said he feared Mugabe would outmanoeuvre his opponents and retain control.</p> <p>\"I believe that under this arrangement the MDC will now be neutralised as a political force. But we will have to wait to see how the union will work but generally the people of Zimbabwe were also looking for some kind of settlement,\" he said.</p> <p>The European Union yesterday said it would consider whether to extend sanctions against Mugabe and other Zanu-PF leaders following the agreement.</p> <h2>Power-sharing: Opposition divisions may be key</h2> <p><strong>How will power-sharing work?</strong></p> <p>Robert Mugabe remains president but with greatly reduced powers. He will chair an advisory cabinet. Morgan Tsvangirai will be prime minister and oversee day-to-day rule through a council of ministers. Tsvangirai will also sit in the cabinet, where the opposition will have a majority of one, allowing it to set policy. Cabinet seats are based on March's parliamentary election. Mugabe's Zanu-PF will have 15 seats, Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change has 13 and a breakaway MDC faction, led by Arthur Mutambara, has three. The opposition also has a majority of MPs.</p> <p><strong>Will it work?</strong></p> <p>There are challenges, not least the bitter legacy of the elections. MDC leaders must work with men who led the murder and torture of MDC activists and their families. There is deep distrust between the two MDC factions. Much will depend on whether Tsvangirai can assert control over the council of ministers. If Tsvangirai does not make power-sharing work, he will quickly lose the people's confidence. </p> <p><strong>So is this the end for Mugabe?</strong></p> <p>Although he has had to concede much of his power, Mugabe is adept at exploiting divisions, notably within the MDC. But some key levers of power, such as the police, will be under MDC control. Meanwhile, a new constitution is to be put in place that could see fresh elections held in as little as 18 months.</p>",
  "<p>Global warming, global terrorism, food crises, water crises, oil conflicts, culture wars - \"civilisation\" seems to be accelerating towards self-destruction. These are circumstances in which art and artists tend to get political or, alternatively, resign themselves to insignificance. In literature, the phenomenon is exacerbated by the difficulty many people have reading for anything beyond content and immediately communicated emotion. As Borges once remarked, since most critics have little sense of the aesthetic, they have to find other criteria for judging a book - political persuasion being the most obvious.</p> <p>At such a moment, it may be worth looking at the work of a man who had a rather unusual take on the relationship between art and politics, who saw the two as intimately related and mutually conditioning, art being allowed a certain, perhaps even pervasive, influence, but not in the crass sense of grinding an axe, or even exploring controversial situations; on the contrary, art might be most \"useful\" when, to all intents and purposes, most \"irrelevant\".</p> <p>Gregory Bateson (1904-80) was born into a family with a history of spirited scientific controversy. His father William, a distinguished naturalist, was responsible for coining the word \"genetics\" and had been both translator and vociferous champion of Mendel's pioneer work on hybrids and heredity. Gregory was named after the Austrian monk, no doubt with the hope that he would follow in his footsteps.</p> <p>It wasn't to be. Explaining to his disappointed father that he was giving up zoology for the relatively new subject of anthropology, the young Bateson spoke of his need for \"a break with ordinary impersonal science\". He had grown up in a house where William Blake's paintings hung on the walls, where art and poetry were revered as the acme of human achievement yet at the same time considered, as his father put it, \"scarcely within the reach of people like ourselves\". Gregory's elder brother, Martin, who aspired to become a poet rather than a scientist, argued bitterly with his father and eventually killed himself in a scenario that might have been invented to demonstrate the limitations of \"impersonal science\". Infatuated with a girl who never gave him the slightest hope, he shot himself by the statue of Eros in Piccadilly Circus, a suicide note and a poem in his pocket.</p> <p>After his brother's suicide, an artist's life must have seemed impossible to Gregory. On the other hand, and rather paradoxically, art was the achievement to which his dogmatic, scientific family attached the greatest value. Bateson's choice of anthropology can be seen as a way of combining the scientific and artistic. In the opening page of his first book, Naven, a study of the Iatmul people of New Guinea, he reflected on the advantages of a novelist's eye when it came to describing a foreign culture: \"The artist . . . can leave a great many of the most fundamental aspects of culture to be picked up not from his actual words, but from his emphasis.\" He can \"group and stress\" words \"so that the reader almost unconsciously receives information which is not explicit in the sentences and which the artist would find it hard - almost impossible - to express in analytic terms. This impressionistic technique is utterly foreign to the methods of science.\"</p> <p>At once it was clear that Bateson's instinct was to grasp, as an artist might, a sense of the wholeness of a culture, rather than to report particular facts. It's not surprising that his second project, in Bali, undertaken with his wife, Margaret Mead, was the first to make systematic use of photographs in an ethnographic study. Ever resistant to the analytic and reductive, Bateson stressed that the photographs should always be seen in relation to each other: </p> <p>In this monograph we are attempting a new method of stating the intangible relationships among different types of culturally standardised behaviour by placing side by side mutually relevant photographs. Pieces of behaviour, spatially and contextually separated - a trance dancer being carried in a procession, a man looking up at an airplane, a servant greeting his master in a play, the painting of a dream - may all be relevant to a single discussion; the same emotional thread may run through them. </p> <p>Over his lifetime, Bateson was involved in a wide range of studies, the early anthropological explorations being followed by work on families and mental health problems (when he invented the idea of \"the double bind\"), studies in cybernetics and communication, and even in the \"language\" of dolphins and other creatures. What seems to have fascinated Bateson was the question: how does a complex culture maintain a relatively steady state, adapting to outside change and correcting internal imbalances? Perhaps, having been brought up in a family always engaged in public polemics and torn apart by the conflict that led to his brother's suicide (another older brother was killed in the first world war), Bateson was looking for the sort of mechanisms that can prevent tension from blowing up into tragedy; hence the rather surprising way he would often mix his anthropology with diagrams of such things as thermostatic cut-out systems, or steam engine governors. In any event, it was his eye for the way negative situations are, or are not, defused before the worst can happen that led to his formulating some interesting reflections on art.</p> <p>In New Guinea, Bateson had been observing the different behaviour patterns of men and women among the local people. The more the men were exhibitionist and boastful, the more the women became quiet and contemplative. It was clear that this reciprocal process was potentially dangerous: competing with each other to show off, the men became extremely aggressive, while it sometimes seemed that the women risked sinking into catatonia. </p> <p>Bateson called his book Naven after the series of bizarre rituals that he came to see as \"correcting\" this behavioural process and guaranteeing stability. In these complex ceremonies men dressed up as women and vice versa. The women assumed the traditional behaviour of the men while the men were abject and passive, even submitting to simulated rape. Crucially, Bateson observed, no one was conscious of what the social function of the ceremonies might be. For the participants, the rituals had religious significance and that was that. Where competing behaviour patterns could push people to extremes, Bateson concluded - and he mentioned such things as the arms race and sadomasochism - corrective influences would very probably be doing their work unacknowledged. It might in fact be important that people remained unaware of what was happening. </p> <p>Turning to modern western societies, the key difference Bateson noted was the prodigious empowerment of the conscious, purposeful mind at the expense of less conscious practices and traditions. Much of his work (excellently anthologised in Steps to an Ecology of Mind) now focused on problems of epistemology: what knowledge we have, how we get it and how it is organised. While man was a complex mesh of mind and matter, and human society a dense labyrinth of interlocking systems, human consciousness, Bateson speculated, contained only very limited information about the whole. Since technology had hugely increased the power of conscious purpose to intervene in the world and alter the environment, the danger was that each \"improvement\" of our situation - a vaccine, an insecticide, a dam - would in fact upset a delicate balance. Back in the 60s, Bateson was among the first to appreciate the dangers of man-made climate change.</p> <p>Where does art come into this? The curious nature of Bateson's \"epistemological\" approach was that it prevented him from proposing remedies to the problems he identified. His thinking contained a kind of catch-22: the conscious mind, his own included, was of its nature incapable of grasping the vast system of which it was only a very small and far from representative part; hence any major intervention to \"solve\" a given problem would always be ill-informed and inadvisable. The only possible solution would be a radical change in our way of thinking, or even our way of knowing, a new (or ancient) mindset in which conscious purpose would be viewed as only a minor and rather suspect part of mental life.</p> <p>Dreams, religious experience, art, love - these were the phenomena that still had power, Bateson thought, to undermine the rash/rational purposeful mind. Of these four, art enjoyed the special role of fusing different \"levels of mind\" together: there was necessarily consciousness and purpose in the decision to create, but creativity itself involved openness to material from the unconscious, otherwise the work would be merely schematic and transparent.</p> <p>Discussing a Balinese painting that at the most immediate level shows a cremation procession, but can also be read as a phallic symbol (the tall cremation tower in the centre has an elephant on each side at the base) or as an account of Balinese social organisation (the etiquette and gaiety of the funeral crowd smoothing the turbulence of grief), Bateson remarks that the painting is profound because not \"really\" about one or the other, or even all three, but about their connectedness. \"In a word, it is only about relationship and not about any identifiable relata.\" </p> <p>Similarly, a novel whose characters develop in a mutually defining play of identities, each changing in response to the others, expressing together a collective ethos of which none is fully representative - one thinks of the Karamazov brothers and their appalling father - undermines the notion that anyone can grasp the overall pattern of which they are a part. So, quite apart from any political content, narrative can induce a contemplative respect for the mysterious interconnectedness of the world, something that, hopefully, might lead to more cautious behaviour and a little less enthusiasm for dramatic intervention. It was a defining moment in Bateson's own career when, having elaborated a series of ideas about mental illness that led to the development of modern family therapy, he withdrew from the field, shocked by the hands-on interventionist approach that his research colleagues had begun to employ.</p> <p>Did Bateson really imagine that humanity might be enchanted into a less destructive, more meditative mode by reading stories and looking at pictures, or better still listening to music, which was pure complex interrelation without any suspicious content? </p> <p>Probably not. Perhaps, true to his own reasoning, he wasn't trying to \"be practical\", but to offer an attractive idea we might enjoy reflecting on. One of the characteristic aspects of his work is his attempt to draw science into the realm of aesthetics. Having likened the prospect of benign government intervention in social behaviour to the task of reversing an articulated lorry through a labyrinth, he concludes: \"We social scientists would do well to hold back our eagerness to control that world which we so imperfectly understand. The fact of our imperfect understanding should not be allowed to feed our anxiety and so increase the need to control. Rather our studies could be inspired by a more ancient, but today less honoured, motive: a curiosity about the world of which we are part. The rewards of such work are not power but beauty.\"</p> <p>Rebelling to the end against his father's tendency to place artistic genius on a pedestal and beyond the reach of ordinary minds, Bateson invites us all, whatever we may be up to, to put beauty before \"practicality\". His achievement was to offer convincing scientific arguments for our doing so.</p>",
  "<p>Andrew Motion was reported this week as having described being poet laureate as not only \"incredibly difficult and entirely thankless\", but also \"very damaging to my writing\"; though he has since indicated that it was the need to compose verse for occasions such as the Queen's diamond wedding anniversary he was referring to, and he sees some of the laureate's bundle of responsibilities, notably \"the chance to speak up for poetry\", as \"extremely valuable\".</p> <p>As his 10-year term comes to an end next year, speculation about his successor has already begun; but a redefinition of the job - currently an odd mix of royal flatterer, PR man for verse and fixture on arts committees and prize panels - is clearly required too. Here are some options.</p> <p><strong>The bardic bureaucrat</strong><br>As proposed by Ian McMillan in a Guardian article resembling a manifesto. He suggested that the poet laureate should become a civil servant, \"paid a decent salary\"; he or she would \"work from the heart of government to influence areas from literacy to public health, from road-building policy to the Ministry of Defence\". McMillan, himself a ubiquitous media presence, Barnsley FC mascot and proven composer of occasional verse, is well-equipped to be a writer in residence in Whitehall on these lines - although, unlike other contenders, he has never won a major poetry award. </p> <p><strong>The prophet</strong><br>A move in the opposite direction: towards reclaiming the poet's traditional shamanic status (recently glimpsed only in Ted Hughes's laureateship) from rockers and rappers. Here the laureate no longer has any obligations to royalty or government, becoming a Cassandra addressing Britain's history and destiny; he or she is free to be wild in language, ideas, behaviour and appearance, and addiction to sex, drugs or visionary rapture might well be an asset. Geoffrey Hill is the outstanding candidate if this option is chosen, but Rowan Williams is a published poet and might find the post thus defined more attractive than trying to prevent the church falling apart. </p> <p><strong>The trouble-maker</strong><br>Retaining much of the prophet's capacity to unsettle, but without the hint of vatic madness and implicit claim to paranormal powers. Compatible with Motion-like promotion of poetry and work in schools, but the laureate becomes conscience not cheerleader, an awkward, questioning outsider rather than a suave insider. Carol Ann Duffy would anyway cause a stir by being the first woman and first openly gay laureate, and her ability to inflame was shown in the recent \"Education for Leisure\" censorship row. Tony Harrison, never shy of public themes or writing abrasively, would fit the bill too.</p> <p><strong>The media tart</strong><br>Part of the current job, but unbundled from the \"thankless\" royal chores. And not to be sneezed at: John Betjeman was best known to the public from the telly. Simon Armitage has followed him in making TV films, and is as popular with broadcasters as Motion, with gigs including presenting Radio 4 series and popping up on TV coverage of the Mercury prize. He also showed an ability to write public verse as the official Millennium poet. McMillan, the presenter of Radio 3's The Verb, is the obvious alternative.</p> <p><strong>The all-rounder</strong><br>Disconnecting the post not only from royal patronage, but also from verse - its status is, after all, a relic of a bygone time when poetry was the unchallenged queen of literary arts. So it would resemble the children's laureateship, open to authors in any genre, and be transformed into a champion of all writing. It could be anyone from Alan Bennett to Dizzee Rascal, but choosing a boundary-crossing writer would have clear advantages and most poets now meet that criterion - combining verse with plays, novels, memoirs and other forms of non-fiction.</p> <p><strong>The language laureate</strong><br>A more prominent platform for a figure such as Michael Rosen, Stephen Fry or Lynne Truss to do what he or she already does as writer and broadcaster: cherishing and celebrating English, but also condemning abuses of it. A one-person academy and grammar and vocab coach to the nation, overseeing all public language, from politicians' speeches to sports commentaries to signage in shops or transport hubs. </p> <p><strong>The praise-singer </strong><br>Retaining the current link to the monarchy, but with what's praised extended to other areas of national life including landscape, nature, architecture and traditions. Perhaps best suited to a master of poetic forms such as John Fuller; but potentially combinable (looking back to Ben Jonson's responsibilities as creator of masques) with a guiding involvement in all national spectacles, including the 2012 Olympics ceremonies - in which case the laureate could be someone gifted in music as well as literature, eg Don Paterson, or have theatre, musical or opera experience.<br><strong>John Dugdale</strong></p> <p>David Musgrave is a literary kind of artist and the proof is his illustrated version of Kafka's Blumfeld, an Elderly Bachelor, published this month in a standalone edition by Four Corners (<a href=\"http://www.fourcornersbooks.co.uk\">fourcornersbooks.co.uk</a>). Blumfeld is the story of two small bouncing balls that invade the flat of the eponymous bachelor. The colourful endpapers depict Blumfeld's balls in all their blue-and-white stripey glory, against a blue-and-white striped background - an effect technically known as headache-inducing. </p> <p>Blumfeld is part of a series, called Familiars, that includes The Picture of Dorian Gray, illustrated by Gareth Jones, and continues this Halloween with Dracula, pictures by James Pyman. Jones has illustrated Dorian Gray with 70s adverts for Gitanes cigarettes - which is kind of leftfield, or Left Bank, but works. Musgrave's approach is even more tangential. At first glance, his freehand illustrations to Blumfeld appear to be fragments of Neolithic tablets: perhaps a comment on the fragmentary nature of this particular story. Kafka's executor, Max Brod, disregarded Kafka's instructions to destroy his papers, and many of us now worry that we should not read these posthumous works at all. Our anxiety is surely misplaced. Brod was an observant Jew and could never destroy something that contained any form of writing, and Kafka knew this.<br><strong>Nicholas Bkincoe</strong></p> <p>Although the shortlist for this year's Man Booker prize was made public on Tuesday, the judges' meeting took place on the previous Wednesday, and authors, agents, publishers and booksellers were notified then. The advantage of this innovation was that the six finalists' publishers were able to reprint them and have stickered copies in shops after the announcement. Keeping the news secret, though, was a challenge for some (\"It was really difficult - I'm such a blabbermouth,\" said one shortlistee), and the agent Derek Johns, who looks after both Sebastian Barry and Linda Grant, reckons that \"as many as 300 people\" may have been in the know. Given this, the lack of leaks was remarkable; but could the feat be repeated next year when going early will no longer be a surprise? Certainly bookies will be suspicious of large bets in the days before the shortlist is unveiled. <strong>JD</strong></p> <p>Including two authors from Hachette-owned imprints (Amitav Ghosh, Linda Grant), one apiece from Penguin (Steve Toltz) and HarperCollins (Philip Hensher), and two from indies (Aravind Adiga from Atlantic, Sebastian Barry from Faber), the shortlist is notable for the absence of any authors from Random House or Picador, which between them have won the prize in three of the four previous years. Also striking is the length of several of the books, perhaps reflecting chairman Michael Portillo's stated enthusiasm for novels that are \"quite epic\". With both Hensher's book and Toltz's topping 700 pages, average length on the 2008 shortlist is 480 pages, compared with 355 in 2007. <strong>JD</strong></p>",
  "<p>Mrs Oedipa Maas came home from a Tupperware party to find that she had been named executor, or she supposed executrix, of the estate of her former lover, Pierce Inverarity, a California property mogul who once lost $2m in his spare time.

A drop-out called Miles appeared from behind a statue of a nymphet. \"I'm lead singer with the Paranoids,\" he said. \"I'm too old to Frug.\"</p> <p>\"You can leave all the enigmatic shit to me,\" said another man, who introduced himself as Metzger. \"I live inside my looks. I was once a child actor called Baby Igor. How about we play Strip Botticelli?\"</p> <p>Oedipa went to her room and put on several more layers of clothes. It could have been a good gag but she blew it and went to bed with him anyway. That was the problem with post-modernism. No self-will, no motivation, no character. She wondered if she should confess her infidelity to Mucho, but why bother when he might have been writing the story? Things did not delay in becoming more curious when they came across Pierce's stamp collection, thousands of coloured windows into time and space, ex-rivals for her affections that would be broken into lots.

I made it up.\" She longed for meaning. Maybe she could find it in Zapf's bookshop. Who were the Tristero assassins? Had she given them life? Had someone been smoking too much dope? She came across a man drawing the Tristero sign of the horn. Why? She visited John Nefastis, the man who postulated Maxwell's Demon with his perpetual motion machine. \"Entropy connects the laws of thermodynamics to information flow,\" he said.</p> <p>\"There's a conspiracy theory,\" Genghis Cohen, the stamp expert, explained. \"All Pierce's stamps are deliberate Tristero errors.\"</p> <p>Metzger was not that bothered at Oedipa's leaving, but then why should he be? He'd had enough and he had never existed without her. Besides he had a 15-year-old nymphet to fuck. Oedipa looked at some deaf-mutes, went to a fag club and dropped in on Mucho. He had dropped out on acid.

  "<p>Phil Nicholas spent the final day of his Italian holiday in Pisa. After negotiating the city's traffic-clogged streets, he found a parking space close to the centre, put some euros in the meter and was soon among the throngs admiring the Piazza dei Miracoli.</p> <p>Then last week he received a letter from Pisa's police - in English - demanding \u20ac113 (\u00a391) for \"circulating in a restricted traffic zone\". If he doesn't pay in 60 days the fine rises to \u20ac185. \"I can't remember seeing any signs at the time,\" he says. \"It just seems like a tax for unwary tourists.\"</p> <p>He's not alone. Just days after he wrote to Guardian Money, we heard from Barry Delaney, from Cheshire. He too was contacted by the Pisa authorities last week, demanding payment for entering a limited zone. The notice gave details of a website to view a photo of the violation - but when he tried to find it, the photo \"could not be presented\".</p> <p>What surprised both men is that the fines were not for violations this summer, but date back many months. In Delaney's case, the alleged violation occurred in June 2007. \"I feel strongly that after such a long time, without apparent evidence, I am being presented with a hefty bill.\"</p> <p>In both cases the drivers were using hired cars. But motorists using their own cars cannot escape.</p> <p>So what is their position now? Are the police taking the pisa, or are these genuine fines? Can foreign authorities access your data at the DVLA? And what happens if you fail to pay? Finding answers to these questions is extraordinarily difficult. Despite a 2005 EU directive - the Mutual Enforcement of Financial Penalties - in reality a picture emerges of ad hoc arrangements and widespread confusion.</p> <p><strong>Are these fines a scam?</strong> In some cases, they are. In August 2004, Guardian Money revealed hundreds of tourists returning from Spain had been sent demands for \u20ac129 to pay non-existent motoring offences. Most were for \"violations\" in the Canaries. The Office of Fair Trading called it a \"convincing scam\", and told holidaymakers not to pay.</p> <p>But the fines from Italy look more genuine. According to the Italian government tourist board, ENIT, \"zona traffico limitato\" areas are in operation in most major cities. Cameras snap vehicles crossing the zone and send the photos to the municipal police computer, which generates a ticket.</p> <p>Back in Britain, the DVLA is forbidden from giving details of UK drivers to foreign enforcement agencies. But the Italians and other police authorities across Europe have found a simple way to circumvent this rule. The DVLA is obliged to release information to anyone in the UK who has a reasonable cause to need it, so foreign authorities have simply hired UK companies to chase fines on their behalf. Probably the biggest is Euro Parking Collection (EPC), which acts for municipalities across the Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland and Scandinavia, and is running a pilot scheme with Florence in Italy.</p> <p><strong>Can you be forced to pay?</strong> EPC says it has a 50% success rate in making British drivers pay, although it describes itself more as a notification, translation and collection service than an enforcement body.</p> <p>EPC legal manager Stuart Hendry says it sends a translated charge notification to the UK address it obtains from the DVLA. He says that no matter where the offence occurs drivers have the same appeal rights as a UK domestic offender. If the driver ignores it, the notice goes back to the issuing authority, which then decides whether to begin cross-border legal action. Hendry admits that few authorities will be bothered to pursue a single fine.</p> <p>\"If you don't pay a notified fine, the legislation is in place to enforce these fines in most countries, but it's a question of practicality and whether it's financially worth pursuing.\" That suggests you can safely ignore it - but beware that it may be treated as a criminal offence and your details held in the country concerned. Ultimately, your car could be seized on your return. </p> <p>Tim Shallcross, head of technical policy at IAM Motoring Trust, says: \"If I knew I'd committed an offence abroad, even unwittingly, and I wanted to return to that country later, personally I wouldn't chance it. I'd pay the fine.\"</p> <p>In Delaney's case it looks like he has a strong case for refusing to pay. According to Hendry, authorities in most European countries are obliged to send a notice within 12 months of the alleged incident. </p> <p><strong>Won't the hire car company simply take it off my credit card?</strong> Yes and no. It's down to individual car hire contracts and local legislation. In the UK, if you are caught, say, in a bus lane, the liability to pay rests with the hire company, according to the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association. It will pay up as soon as it receives the charge, then claim it back off the credit card used for the booking. But if the offence is speeding, then the car hire company sends the details of the hirer for the police to pursue. It's likely that, in Italy, the hire companies were obliged to send address details to the police rather than take fines off the hirer's credit card.</p> <p><strong>Why are the fines coming from Italy and not France or Spain?</strong> It's another legal peculiarity. In France, Spain and Germany the police cannot outsource the collection of fines, so they can't obtain data from the DVLA. But that's not a licence to drive like a lunatic in those countries; on-the-spot fines are far more prevalent than in the UK. </p> <p><strong>What about all those Europeans over here? I bet they never pay fines</strong>. Wrong. Euro Parking's biggest client is Transport for London (TfL), and since 2005 has chased European drivers for unpaid congestion charges. </p> <p>A TfL spokesperson says EPC regularly recovers around 40% of the penalties issued. </p> <p>But looked at another way, that means the drivers of six out of 10 foreign-registered vehicles don't cough up. The Germans, it seems, are the worst. There are nearly 30,000 unpaid congestion charge notices against German vehicles, followed by Poland (15,376) Italy (11,846) and Spain (9,493).<br><a href=\"mailto:money@theguardian.com\"><br>money@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>As if contending with Hurricane Ike wasn't enough, some Brits on holiday in Cuba are finding themselves stranded without cash after discovering that banks, hotels and shops won't accept their credit cards.</p> <p>Ann Howard and her husband, Andrew Morrison, this week told Guardian Money how their trip last month almost became a nightmare after no one would take their plastic. But why on earth would the island turn its nose up at Virgin Money and Egg credit cards, bearing in mind they display the globally recognised MasterCard and Visa logos? Heavens, you can even fly Virgin Atlantic to Cuba's capital, Havana.</p> <p>The answer, it seems, is that the US blockade of the island is having far-reaching and arguably unjust consequences for us here on the other side of the pond. The US government operates an embargo against Cuba and, as a result, credit cards and travellers' cheques issued by American banks are not accepted. However, many people will be unaware that this policy also includes the UK divisions of US banks such as MBNA and Capital One.</p> <p>A number of well-known credit cards that we would think of as \"British\" ultimately have a US company behind them. For example, Egg was last year taken over by the US banking giant Citigroup, while the Virgin Money card is issued by MBNA Europe, owned by Bank of America Corporation. MBNA issues cards for scores of UK companies and organisations, including Alliance &amp; Leicester, and many charities and football clubs.</p> <p>Ann and her husband enjoyed their 18-day holiday to Cuba - and were fortunate enough to avoid the hurricanes which have battered the island during the last few days - but almost had to fly home after discovering, to their cost, that no-one would touch their cards. \"Although we took some cash, we were relying on our cards to get funds while we were there,\" says Ann, of south-east London. \"Fortunately, the travel agent came to our rescue, but we were without sufficient money for seven days.\" The couple eventually managed to get some cash transferred from Ann's current account to the card of the agent's Cuban rep.</p> <p>She says the card companies told them they do not do business with Cuba because their systems cannot be relied on. But this is likely to be a red herring; the real answer is that, as a spokesman for MBNA explains, \"cards from US-issued banks are not accepted at all in Cuba. That is US law\".</p> <p>A Virgin Money spokesman says MBNA \"has to abide by American law\". Egg says: \"We are sorry for any inconvenience suffered by our customer. However, Egg is a UK registered company with a US parent ... and is therefore subject to certain US laws.\"</p> <p>The UK Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office's advice is: \"Check with your bank to confirm that your debit/credit/cashpoint cards will be accepted.

  "<p>Charlie Hodgson had the final word of a kicking contest with a drop-goal which allowed Sale's stellar squad to escape with victory last night. Mathew Tait, Dwayne Peel and Kristian Ormsby all made their home debuts but the stars of the night were the kicking boots of Glen Jackson - for Saracens - and Luke McAlister, until, with nothing on the game clock Hodgson, still nursing the mental bruising of touring with England in the summer, chipped over from in front of the posts.</p> <p>\"We have had a very long discussion with him and he has come back stronger,\" said Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9, the Sale director of rugby, of Hodgson. \"Last week he scored a try to win the game, this time it was a drop-goal in injury time.\"</p> <p>Sale's rotation system gave Richard Wigglesworth his first start after a summer to forget. Dropped by England for the final Test in New Zealand then omitted from Martin Johnson's first elite squad, the scrum-half is also playing second fiddle at Sale after Peel's arrival.</p> <p>Very much in Johnson's mind is the scrum power of Andrew Sheridan, who missed the opening weekend with hamstring problems, but who last night got a taste of autumn Tests to come when he packed down opposite Census Johnston, one of three Saracens pencilled in to play for the Pacific Islands at Twickenham.</p> <p>Their first collision brought a penalty to Sale but it was from two penalties at the breakdown that Saracens eased into a six-point lead from Jackson's boot - Saracens seemingly better versed in the new laws, while Sale scratched their heads.</p> <p>A third Jackson penalty took the lead to nine points before Sale gained a foothold outside their 22 long enough for Hodgson to land his first penalties and cut the half-time lead to three.</p> <p>In 40 minutes the talented Sale back line had produced just one move of bite, McAlister cruising through midfield with Tait coming up on the outside, but the New Zealander was more productive with the boot when he took over from Hodgson, twice edging Sale ahead.</p> <p>If Saracens edged the first half, at least until their scrum-half Neil de Kock hobbled off, then the second had already gone to Sale before Hodgson settled things, although Saracens came closest to the only try of the night.</p> <p>Richard Haughton carved his way through 60 yards of Sale shirts, Johnston barged another 10 and Andy Saull, just out of the Saracens academy, thought he got over.

  "<p>'If we can't just laugh at the venality of the people in our families sometimes,\" says Alexander Waugh, \"then I think we would all end up slitting our wrists.\" For Evelyn Waugh's grandson, the ability to laugh about just about anything is a vital part of his inheritance. Alexander was just a toddler when his grandfather, Evelyn, one of the most successful English novelists of the last century, keeled over and died in the downstairs loo of his house in Somerset. He has a photograph of himself on the great man's lap and a strong impression of the house, Combe Florey, but no actual memory of the character who did so much to shape his own life.</p> <p>Alexander's late father, Auberon, the celebrated and controversial journalist, passed on some mixed messages, but like Evelyn's other children he was deeply loyal. Alexander, in turn, named his own son Auberon (pronounced Orbr'n - \"never to be confused with Oberon, a jealous fairy out of Shakespeare\"). I've been warned by his publisher that he doesn't want to talk about his forebears. Our conversation should concentrate on another family story, that of the turbulent and tragic Wittgensteins, for this is the subject of his new book. And that's fine, because what he says about the Wittgensteins sheds a bright light on family dynamics, including his own.</p> <p>As it turns out, though, there is no avoiding the subject of Evelyn Waugh. Combe Florey, where Evelyn is buried, has just been sold to a banker by Alexander's mother, Auberon's widow, Teresa. \"It's sad,\" Alexander says in the car on the way from the station. But while she has chosen to move away from the past, Alexander is holding on. As a new film of his grandfather's best-loved novel, Brideshead Revisited, opens in cinemas and attempts to repeat the extraordinary success of the 1980s television adaptation, Alexander is about to become the custodian of an enormous quantity of papers.</p> <p>His memoir, Fathers and Sons, published a few years ago, worked hard to remove blame from Evelyn, sometimes defending him outright, at other times offering a charitable interpretation. \"I think he had low blood-sugar levels, all the chemicals were wrong,\" is how he answers a question about Evelyn's coldness to his children. \"He was drinking too much and taking sleeping pills and at times he felt dreadful. They really irritated him and he was tough with them, but he didn't whip them and bash them.\"</p> <p>We settle down to talk around the large kitchen table in his secluded farmhouse, a few miles from Taunton in Somerset, while he unpacks the shopping. Children wander in and out as Alexander considers how best to cook a large brill. The house is cosy and fashionably shabby, with well-worn furniture and interesting pictures and maps on the walls and a huge Steinway piano where Alexander will later play me snatches of Ravel. </p> <p>Now in his mid-40s, slightly scruffy and a bit round with thinning hair, he seems well-suited to his role as country gentleman and family man and stops to talk to the driver of a passing tractor when we venture outside and down the lane after lunch. His voice can sound a bit Prince Charles-ish, but while unmistakably posh the household feels relaxed and he is full of gratitude to me for having come to see him here - thus avoiding the necessity of a visit to London, which he avoids whenever he can. </p> <p>Alexander holds two previous generations of Waughs responsible for the defects in Evelyn's character. The first Alexander Waugh, Evelyn's grandfather, was a sadist and bully suspected in the family of having sexually abused his three daughters. Arthur Waugh, Evelyn's father, a publisher, was a gentler soul but his infatuation with his elder son, Alec, was a slight from which Evelyn never recovered and which he visited on his own children in his shameless preference for Auberon's sister Meg.</p> <p>\"Evelyn had a huge circle of friends who adored him, they loved him,\" Alexander says. \"I think he was an extraordinarily weird man and quite uncomfortable to be with ... He was a man of great exaggeration so that his warm sides, his funny sides, his generous sides, were much bigger than many other people's. Similarly, his rudeness was so outrageous and so appalling that he made some very, very bitter enemies and I think that's what's interesting about him.\"</p> <p>Humour, for Evelyn's admirers, is his saving grace. \"It is a form of kindness,\" says Alexander. \"When you see someone making a joke, it means they're not being selfish and wrapped up in their own thoughts. It's a sharing, like having a really good conversation or a delicious meal. I also think that humour is a form of supreme intelligence because everything's wonky and crap actually and inexplicable and cheap and foolish, and you've got a choice. You can be earnest and serious but I don't think you're going to get to the bottom of anything. But in jokes, I think you can say an awful lot of things.\"</p> <p>When Fathers and Sons was published, Alexander did the literary festival circuit with a witty talk that turned tales of paternal indifference and cruelty into hilarious anecdote. But is it really funny, I ask, that Evelyn poisoned his children's pet rabbits with goblets of vodka intended to perk them up on New Year's eve? Or that Laura (Evelyn's second wife) was less interested in her children than in her loss-making herd of cows? \"I think the important thing is to see that it's funny, for the health of the people involved. Those who don't know any of the characters in that book, I'm perfectly happy for you to read it and either be horrified or find it funny, whichever you want. I would say that, for the people involved, it's quite important to be able to see the funny side because otherwise I think all family life is tragic and very upsetting.\"</p> <p>Once a year, Alexander receives a cheque from the Waugh estate, usually about three or four thousand pounds, representing his 1/24th share of the royalties. So many copies of Evelyn's novels were published in his lifetime that he doesn't expect the figure to shoot up but, modest as the sum is, he takes pride in it. Being a Waugh, he explains, is \"not like being a Hitler or a Mosley or anything. I mean they weren't really anything these Waughs, apart from being very good writers. They entertained people and they gave people pleasure.\"</p> <p>Comedy, or anything approaching a joke, is harder to come by in Waugh's new work, a biography of the Wittgenstein family. Conceived as the first life of the philosopher's brother Paul, who lost his right arm in the first world war but went on to become a renowned concert pianist, it tells the dramatic story of the rise and fall one of Vienna's richest families.</p> <p>Karl Wittgenstein was a vastly successful steel magnate and collector of musical manuscripts, and much of the plot concerns the rift that opened between his sons Paul and Ludwig and their sisters in the 1930s, when they clashed with the Nazis over their inheritance. But when asked which is the single most important relationship in the family, Alexander doesn't hesitate: \"The father-son relationship is always [the most important] for boys ... the father had this stinking temper and dominated the whole thing like crazy and because he made so much money, he was built up after his death to be a super-figure that they all had to revere. And he was obviously quite a nasty man. I think all that striving to succeed and the whole madness of being a concert pianist when your arm has been chopped off was all the influence of the father.\" </p> <p>No fewer than three other brothers committed suicide, while Ludwig moved to England, but his profound estrangement from Paul, and Paul's unending quarrel with his sisters - not to mention his rows with Ravel, Prokofiev and Benjamin Britten, all of whom composed one-handed works for him - make it a story of painful and lasting divisions.</p> <p>\"I think it would be very easy to read the book fast and say, well, this book is about a lot of very rich, rather spoiled, rather unattractive people,\" Waugh says, \"but I hope the humanity of all of them comes through. I certainly felt sympathy with the lot of them. They were such different times, the circumstances were extraordinary.\"</p> <p>In certain respects, Alexander Waugh seems to cherish the aspect of a Victorian paterfamilias. To enter his study, known as \"the library\", his children must knock and address him as \"Sir\" and they get booed for watching TV (though Facebook seems to be allowed). But the warm domestic atmosphere of his home belies the bleak language he uses to describe family life in the abstract. He met his wife, Eliza, when they were both students at Manchester University, and they have three children - Mary (15), Sally (13) and Bron (10). Mary may or may not still be in bed when I arrive but all three join us for a hot, sit-down lunch. \"I think every generation is better than the last,\" he says, \"not just at being good parents but cleverer, smarter. Everything's getting better all the time.\"</p> <p>Does that means he is cleverer than Evelyn Waugh?</p> <p>\"Yeah. I think I probably am, well I'm sure I am. But that's not the same thing as saying I can write a better novel. I would say I could probably write a better non-fiction book but that's not really the point about being cleverer. I'm wiser than he is. I think he did things that weren't wise at all. His inability to control himself wasn't great and people would argue vehemently with this but I would say his Catholicism was highly unwise ... I think nowadays maybe a wiser person might be able to be very religious and allow their children the freedom to make those sort of decisions [themselves] without it being rammed down their throats.\"</p> <p>But despite such apparent faith in progress and his evident fondness for his own father's memory - (\"I adored him, most of my memories are very, very warm\") - he holds to the belief that father-son relationships \"never really work\". </p> <p>Martin Amis calls it \"the argument that never really ends,\" and Waugh agrees that the relationship isn't over \"until both parties are dead\". He believes writing and thinking about other families helps to sort things out in your own life but remains very pessimistic about the prospects for his own son.</p> <p>\"He's a delightful boy. He adores me and I adore him, but I've told him to his face that we're not going to be great friends for ever, and in a way it is sad but it's so inevitable that I just wonder if it's better to warn him in advance. I think the thing is entirely Darwinian, it's evolutionary. </p> <p>\"It's absolutely right that a son should grow up to battle with his father and resent him and try to overpower him to some extent - not precisely castrate him, as the ancient Greek gods did to one another, but castrate him metaphorically and that is how the species keeps improving as it goes on. It's ridiculous the idea that you can be a perfect father and that's what was wrong with those Wittgensteins.\"</p> <p>The pressure on girls is less intense, he believes. \"There are fewer demands on daughters. They don't have to do anything ... I feel quite ambitious for all three of my children but I feel more worried in professional terms for Bron. I feel that somehow as a boy he's got to stand out, poor fellow, and maybe I'm way out of track here but I'm telling you what I feel.\"</p> <p>In the end, then, it is Evelyn Waugh's brazen honesty for which we must thank him, his unsentimental admission that family life did not please him. While we may be able to soften the facts, Alexander seems to say, we can't really change them. \"I think there's a fallacy about families. Every family sets out with this sacred idea of a happy unit and it's largely built up by Hollywood and we forget that 40, 50, 60% of what family's about is really all quite sad. But we're pushing all the time, particularly modern families, to create this Father Christmas happy illusion of what a family's really about. </p> <p>Of course it has very, very happy moments but, by God, it has endless tension, boredom, strife, irritability and competitiveness among siblings, and I think you've got to work hard to keep the whole thing together.\"</p> <p>And, of course, tell jokes.</p> <p>The House of Wittgenstein by Alexander Waugh is published by Bloomsbury on Monday, priced \u00a320.

This restaurant and hotel stands by the river Monnow in Skenfrith, a village with a fine church and ruined castle, presumably intended to keep the Welsh under control - no chance. It must rank among the most picturesque spots in Britain. The wood panelled dining room and bar have an almost chalet-like feel, smart but informal, and the kitchen serves fine food to partner the spectacular wines. About 12 miles from Abergavenny, dangerously close to the English border in fact.

Franco was also consultant chef here for many years. His influence still shows in Lady Llanover's salt duck and the vincisgrassi - a lasagna-like confection flavoured with porcini, parma ham and truffle. Monmouth is 15 miles from Abergavenny.

Google up the reviews but basically the essential information is this. The sort of dishes you can expect to find will have a strong bias toward offal and fish, calf's sweetbreads with potato and olive cake, Scottish girolles on toast with garlic butter or seared scallops in salad with sesame dressing to start, then turbot with mussels and saffron or roast pigeon with pastilla of the legs as a main. Dessert might be greengages with ginger custard or spiced sponge cake with wimberries and honey ice cream to finish. The damage?

  "<p>Newcastle United's owner, Mike Ashley, last night failed in a dramatic attempt to lure Kevin Keegan back to the club as manager, little more than a week after the former England coach quit saying conditions there made his job intolerable.</p> <p>Keegan and Ashley spent yesterday evening locked in talks, their first since the acrimonious split. But the prolonged discussions failed to end in a rapprochement and, with no further meetings planned, the always slender likelihood of Keegan resuming the job he left just nine days ago now appears remote.</p> <p>On one of the more surreal days in Newcastle's often bizarre history, Keegan travelled to London yesterday to meet Ashley, the billionaire owner of Sports Direct, in a borrowed West End office and it is understood that having initially discussed a severance deal the subject of his potential reinstatement was raised.</p> <p>Yet as bookmakers stopped taking bets on Keegan being back in charge for today's game at home to Hull, those talks were seemingly becoming strained. Shortly after 8pm Ashley departed the building by the front door and refused to comment to reporters before being driven away. Keegan apparently slipped out undetected by a rear exit and, at around 10.30pm, the League Managers Association issued a statement on his behalf.</p> <p>\"The League Managers Association can confirm that talks to resolve several issues were held today between Kevin Keegan and Mike Ashley of Newcastle United Football Club,\" it said. \"However, the discussion failed to reach a satisfactory conclusion.\"</p> <p>Ashley had been in New York when Keegan resigned after a row with Dennis Wise, Newcastle's director of football, and Derek Llambias, the club's managing director, last week and yesterday was their first face-to-face meeting since.</p> <p>While Ashley is understood to have been taken aback by the outraged reaction of Newcastle fans to Keegan's departure - protests are planned at St James' Park today - it was always difficult to envisage a compromise being achieved which would have enabled Keegan to enjoy a satisfactory working relationship with Wise.</p> <p>There had been suggestions he would be asked to return in a shamelessly populist advance of a takeover by the Indian billionaire Anil Ambani's Reliance group. Last night, however, a spokesman for the group said: \"We are no longer interested in buying Newcastle because of the turbulent conditions which currently exist there and because we have been unable to have satisfying talks with anyone from the club.\"</p> <p>Ambani may now turn his attentions to Everton. This week his representatives contacted Bill Kenwright, Everton's owner, and asked if he would be willing to enter talks. Kenwright, who has appointed Keith Harris of Seymour Pearce to flush out potential investors, is understood to have responded positively and could meet Ambani's representatives next week.</p> <p>Ashley, meanwhile, insists he is in control of Newcastle for the long haul and has a five-year plan for the club. With Keegan no longer part of that blueprint, his immediate task is to appoint a replacement manager and he already has a three-man shortlist comprising Paul Ince, Gus Poyet and Didier Deschamps. With yesterday's meeting in London on the agenda the recruitment process had been placed on hold but now that Keegan appears out of the equation Ashley is expected to address the issue at a board meeting on Monday. </p>",
  "<p>Just breaking late Friday afternoon east coast time: Todd Palin <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jOTk11gvqDAgD0cY3i4WjI_2YOxwD935CRTG0\">was subpoenaed</a> by the Alaska legislature in the Troopergate story. One Republican joined two Democrats on the five-member legislative panel in voting for the subpoena.</p> <p>There's not much info beyond that right now; the AP story I link to above has the necessary background. The apparent risk here for Sarah P. is that her husband somehow made improper use of the levers of state government in going after the brother-in-law. It's a bit of a relief for Palin herself that she wasn't subpoenaed, but if the husband has to answer questions under oath about his role, that's at least a headache.</p>",
  "<p>It was billed as a victory rally and held in Old Billingsgate on the edge of the Thames, the very heart of historical London. </p> <p>Flyers dropped through the letter boxes of thousands of homes, inviting people to \"celebrate a turning point in medical history\". </p> <p>Spotlighted on the podium against a darkened Grand Hall on the night of March 24 last year was a charismatic figure with prematurely white hair and such impassioned oratorical skills that the several hundred in the audience seemed enthralled as he denounced modern medicine, accused the pharmaceutical industry of murderous intent and hailed vitamins and minerals as the cure for all diseases. </p> <p>This was Matthias Rath, the vitamin promoter who has been accused of endangering the lives of Aids sufferers in South Africa and who was now embarking on a further chapter of his business plan.</p> <p>Rath, who says he was born in Germany although documents he filed at Companies House say he is Dutch, obtained his basic medical degree in 1985, after studying in Munster and Hamburg. </p> <p>The 53-year-old became a researcher first at the University Clinic in Hamburg and then, during 1989 and 1990, at the Berlin Heart Centre.</p> <p>After this, however, Rath followed a path which led him to repudiate modern medicine and set himself up as the guru of a movement which claimed it could cure all the world's diseases with simple concoctions of micronutrients - vitamin and mineral pills which he sells across the world through his websites.</p> <p>Rath left Germany to work at the Linus Pauling Institute in California. Pauling, the then 89-year-old double Nobel Prize winner - for chemistry in 1954 and peace in 1962 (for campaigning against above-ground nuclear testing) - was convinced that vitamins and minerals could cure diseases. Towards the end of his life (he died in 1994), he attempted to prove that high dose vitamin C could kill cancer.</p> <p>Among Rath's claims on his website and in all his publicity materials is his assertion that Pauling chose him as his successor. </p> <p>Those at the institute in the 1990s say Pauling may have thought of him as a leader in the context of micronutrients, but no more than that - and that the Nobel laureate always said it was not for him but for the institute to decide his successor. </p> <p>Not long after Pauling's death, in what was to become a long chapter of legal actions against his critics around the world, Rath sued the institute for interfering with his business relationships. </p> <p>He lost and the institute counter-sued for libel and interfering in their business relationships. The case was settled out of court in 1994 and all agreements between Pauling and Rath were nullified. Rath was assigned some patents and ordered to pay the institute $75,000 (about \u00a343,000).</p> <p>By now, he had his own self-styled foundation, which he claims is non-profit-making and seeks donations for research, although it is thought to make millions from sales of his products. </p> <p>His basic health formula, called Vitacor Plus in the UK and dispatched from a trading estate in Slough, was selling last year to those who attended the Billingsgate rally at \u00a326.50 for 90 pills.</p> <p>He set up in the UK early on, as Matthias Rath Ltd, with a registered address in Guildford, Surrey, in July 1998.</p> <p>The business was categorised as \"manufacture of other food products\". Rath, declaring Dutch nationality and an address in the Netherlands, was a director and the company is still active.</p> <p>In 2000, however, he fell foul of the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)over a newsletter with the heading \"GOOD HEALTH - do it yourself\", which claimed that Rath's vitamins could prevent a range of conditions, from heart attacks to strokes and high blood pressure. </p> <p>Two years later, the ASA made a second ruling. This time it was against a claim published in Britain by a California-based organisation called the \"Health4Us Foundation\" - which appears to provide publicity for the Rath Foundation - that Rath's \"remarkable natural approach is capable of controlling the spread of cancerous cells in the human body without damaging healthy cells\".</p> <p>Other rulings have followed. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US in the same year ordered Rath to take his unproven therapeutic claims for Vitacor Plus and Diacor off his website. </p> <p>In 2003, the regional court in Berlin banned Rath from calling himself in his adverts \"the renowned doctor\" and/or \"the renowned scientist\", after a court case in which medical and scientific witnesses said he was neither.</p> <p>In the same year, Rath's theories and micronutrients were disavowed by the respected and influential Swiss Study Group for Complementary and Alternative Methods in Cancer.</p> <p>\"After examining the literature and other available information,\" it said, the group \"have found no proof that the vitamin preparations of Dr Matthias Rath have any effect on human cancer. </p> <p>\"They advise against their use in cancer prevention and treatment while recommending a diet rich in fruit and vegetables.\"</p> <p>The distressing case of a young boy with cancer was making headlines in Germany in 2003. </p> <p>Dominik Feld, nine, had bone cancer, but his parents would not accept the doctors' decision that his leg had to be amputated to save his life. His chances of surviving with chemotherapy were one in five, their consultant said. The parents, Josef and Anke Feld, opted for Rath's natural remedies instead. </p> <p>A protracted legal tussle ensued, as social services obtained an order for the boy to be taken into care and then the parents succeeded in the high court in regaining custody of their child. </p> <p>At rallies and demonstrations outside every court hearing, protesters demanded the parents' right to continue giving the child Rath's \"cell therapy\". </p> <p>Rath claims the boy got better, but clinicians say the cancer spread and he was returned to hospital for further treatment. Eventually his parents flew him to an alternative therapy clinic in Mexico, where he died in November 2004.</p> <p>That year, Rath turned up in South Africa, the country worst hit by the Aids epidemic with a long history of the use of herbal and traditional remedies and a government that was prevaricating over the introduction of Aids medicines. President Thabo Mbeki had outraged the global medical establishment by publicly voicing his doubts over both the disease and its treatment. He had flirted with the Aids deniers in the United States, who say there is no proof a virus causes Aids. </p> <p>Mbeki preferred to view Aids as a disease of poverty, which required economic development, not the expensive drugs with unpleasant side-effects which were by then keeping those with HIV alive in rich countries.</p> <p>Rath followed his usual modus operandi; prominent adverts were placed in influential newspapers, denouncing the profit-hungry pharmaceutical industry and suggesting that natural remedies would heal the world. </p> <p>But as elsewhere, the South African advertising standards authority instructed newspapers not to run the ads - although some disobeyed.</p> <p>By 2005, Rath had forged an alliance with Sanco, the South African National Civics Organisation. </p> <p>Sanco's operatives were handing out vitamins to people with Aids in the township of Khayelitsha and, according to his own account, also Western Cape and KwaZuluNatal.</p> <p>The Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), which was gradually making progress in its fight for free Aids drugs for South Africans, was appalled at the claims Rath was making - that vitamins could reverse the course of Aids - and by the discovery that some people had stopped taking their Aids medicines in favour of Rath's product VitaCell. </p> <p>Doctors working for M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, which opened the first clinic offering free antiretrovirals in the country in Khayelitsha, testified that some patients had died. </p> <p>To add to the anxiety, Rath had been seen with the health minister, Manto Tshabala-Msimang, who was later to back the healing properties of lemon, garlic and beetroot over ARVs. </p> <p>There were suspicions that Rath was hoping for a government contract to provide vitamins to Aids sufferers.</p> <p>Rath said he was carrying out a study. He has now published results on his website, claiming 748 patients received VitaCell. He says all had advanced Aids and none were on antiretroviral drugs - although there is sworn testimony that some were and stopped taking the drugs. Rath claims the symptoms of the participants universally improved.</p> <p>TAC took an action to the courts against Rath and won a ruling in June that the study was illegal, because it did not have approval to use a product with a claimed therapeutic effect. </p> <p>The court also ruled that the South African government had breached the law by failing to clamp down on those peddling unlicensed remedies. </p> <p>Rath is now appealing against the South African decision, while expanding his global reach. </p> <p>The victory rally in Billingsgate last year was funded by the \u00a3100,000 proceeds of a legal action against the British Medical Journal which made an error in its coverage of the Dominik Feld case. </p> <p>Rath used his \"natural health victory lecture\" in Billingsgate to lambast the BMJ and launch a very personal attack on its editor, accusing them of hiding \"the scientific facts about the health benefits of vitamins\".</p> <p>The Rath Foundation website is now available in 17 languages. It is proactive in eight countries - the US, the UK, South Africa, Germany, Netherlands, France, Spain and most recently, Russia. </p> <p>In a repeat of the characteristic pattern, a large advertisement, looking very much like editorial, appeared in Izvestia in February under the heading \"Russia can become a health care model for the world\". </p> <p>While Russia is under threat from the US and parts of western Europe, the greatest threat to world peace is the drug industry, it says. But it has the opportunity to reduce common diseases, such as cancer, heart disease and strokes, to a fraction of the present level - through natural health approaches.</p>",
  "<p>The two hurricanes that have ripped through Cuba over the past week have received less than a <a href=\"http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=20ca99fd-97e4-4f76-abe6-a807b1bd1110\">passing blink</a> from international news organisations. This is in stark contrast to the mountains of <a href=\"http://news.google.co.uk/news?hl=en&amp;q=%22hurricane%20gustav%22%20new%20orleans&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn\">press coverage devoted to the evacuation of New Orleans</a> this month. Then again, the American-Cuban relationship has never been balanced.</p> <p>Last week, Hurricane Gustav ripped through the western half of the Cuban island at Category 4 force, while this week Havana narrowly escaped a direct hit by the eye of Hurricane Ike raging initially at the same level, though it was later reduced to Category 1 status. Despite that considerable mercy, Ike ravaged the whole island, from Guant\u00e1namo in the extreme east to Pinar del Rio in the far west. </p> <p>Cuba is <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jmSQr1vje6Z4LBCZAkEcNvN9WUKgD9346UHO0\">well prepared for hurricanes</a>, and the government routinely calls for mass evacuations when hurricanes descend. The <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/09/12/news/CB-Cuba-Hurricane-Ike.php\">current death toll</a> lies at seven in Cuba, but the <a href=\"http://www.redcross.org.uk/donatesection.asp?id=85241\">actual and potential destruction</a> belies those figures. Gustav tore out at least 120,000 houses in Cuba's western provinces, leaving crops and food supplies \u2013 already in short supply in a country where rationing still exists \u2013 heavily depleted. That was last week, before Ike had screamed its way across Cuba's countryside and cities.</p> <p>No one yet knows the price Cubans will pay for these hurricanes. Fidel Castro has likened their impact to <a href=\"http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2008/septiembre/mier3/Reflections-3sept.html\">a nuclear attack</a>. Few images of the country have reached us. Communications with friends in Havana and the coast were severely limited by the cutting of power supplies, the evacuations to mass shelters and, perhaps more than any other factor, the fear of what was, and is, to come. The Cuban army has been out in force with building materials and food, but the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/10/AR2008091002723.html\">scale of the destruction is vast</a>, and nobody yet knows quite how it will be tackled. Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, Russia, and even East Timor have offered assistance. George Bush remains <a href=\"http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/06/22/usdom16239.htm\">ominously quiet</a>.</p> <p>Barack Obama, by contrast, has called for an immediate 90 day suspension of the US-Cuba trade embargo. <em>El Bloqueo</em>, as it is known in Cuba, was imposed on February 7, 1962 by John F Kennedy's government following the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in which Cuba played its role in the escalation of the cold war between Russia and the US. Cuba's immediate presence within howling distance of American waters caused such alarm to the US government that it felt compelled to introduce financial, travel and trade restrictions on its island neighbour.</p> <p>In 1992, the US passed the Torricelli Act, also known as the Cuban Democracy Act, since its stated purpose was to bring democracy to the Cuban people. In fact, it forbade American companies from trading with Cuba, prevented foreign ships which used American ports from travelling to Cuban ports for 180 days, interned ships returning from Cuba and, on a human level, banned Cuban families who lived in the US from sending much-needed cash back to their families in Cuba.</p> <p>The hope was that Cuba would suffer an acute economic collapse. In 1996, the Helms-Burton legislation was passed, and Bill Clinton later tightened it further. Among its many strangleholds, it places wide-ranging restrictions on US citizens trading or doing any form of business with Cuba. This law, which the UN general assembly has condemned roundly for many years, applies both to US firms as well as to overseas firms owned or controlled by \"US persons\". In 2006, President Bush created a task force designed to <a href=\"http://hrw.org/reports/2005/cuba1005/\">enforce and pursue violators of the embargo</a> even more aggressively, with potential penalties resulting in 10-year jail terms as well as huge fines. </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.righttofood.org/new/PDF/Cuba.pdf\">2007 report</a> [PDF] by the UN special rapporteur on the right to food highlights the devastating impact that the embargo has had on Cuba's food production and importation. The report states, by way of example:</p> <blockquote> <p>Over 80% of dairy imports to Cuba consist of milk powder for use in the social programme, imported from New Zealand and the European Union. Rice is shipped from China and Vietnam, taking 45 days to reach Cuba. By way of comparison, it would cost one-third of the price to ship from the United States and would only take two days. Increased transaction costs also affect the import of food. US products must be paid for in advance in cash or through letters of credit drawn on third country banks. The [Cuban] government estimates that incremental (transaction) costs for food and agricultural imports incurred in 2006 due to the embargo amounted to $62.8m.</p> </blockquote> <p>An embargo \"to bring democracy\" is a tool of warfare, and needs to be recognised as such. Cuba, however, is dealing with enough of her own demons at present. Whirling winds have wreaked a war-like devastation on a land that has stayed determined to seek its own course through history. It is high time the embargo is lifted, not just for 90 days, but for good. According to the Cuban government, the embargo has cost the Cuban economy over $89bn since its introduction and resulted in $258m of losses in the food sector from May 2006 to April 2007. </p> <p>The response from the US government remains dogmatic. Secretary of state Condoleezza Rice has refused to lift the blockade, saying that Bush would be prepared to respond \"to a Cuban regime that is prepared to release political prisoners [and] has a process to get to free and fair elections.\" She added: \"We can see nothing that suggests that has come about.\" The irony of both of these comments is extreme: Guant\u00e1namo and Florida are close to many Cubans, both physically and emotionally. Neither of those places conjures up the release of political prisoners or free and fair elections.</p> <p>Instead, the US has offered \"assessment\" by one of its specialists to determine what level of humanitarian relief Cuba will require in the wake of the hurricanes. The Cuban government has refused this offer, asking that the embargo be lifted so that it can buy the materials it needs to help itself.</p> <p>It is time the Americans stopped holding hostages. Democracy can't be bartered in a capital market, nor imposed in a court of war. If democracy is a tool intended to inspire and help people to determine their own fate, the Cubans need to be allowed both to build and to determine their own. If common sense and fairness cannot prevail upon the US government to change its mind, these hurricanes and the rest of the world certainly should.</p>",

International authorities on Aids welcomed the outcome. Prof Brian Gazzard, one of the UK's leading HIV/Aids experts, who advised the Guardian on its case, said he was delighted at the result. \"The widespread provision of anti-retrovirals in sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most important public health measures of this century,\" he said. The confusion caused by suggestions that giving undernourished people vitamins and minerals was an alternative to taking Aids drugs was \"extremely harmful\".</p> <p>Mark Wainberg, director of the McGill Aids centre in Montreal, said: \"It is clear that he [Rath] has done enormous harm to people with HIV.\" Rath was linked to the Aids deniers who convinced people, he said, that Aids was not dangerous and that \"you can treat yourself with medicines that are a complete waste of time\".</p> <p>John Moore, professor of microbiology and immunobiology at Cornell University in the United States, said: \"The promotion of micronutrients and vitamin pills as effective remedies for HIV harms infected people. If they stop taking the anti-retroviral drugs that we are know are effective, their health suffers.\"</p> <p>After the high court awarded initial costs of \u00a3220,000 to the Guardian, its editor, Alan Rusbridger, said: \"We are very glad that Rath has dropped his libel action, doubtless designed to discourage other journalists - in Britain and abroad - from looking too closely at his dubious claims and methods. We will seek to recover the costs of defending our journalism.\"</p> <p>The Guardian articles appeared in January and February last year in the Bad Science column written by Ben Goldacre, who said Rath \"aggressively sells his message to Aids victims in South Africa that Rath vitamin pills are better than medication\".</p> <p>Goldacre praised Zackie Achmat, founder of the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) in South Africa, for winning his long-running battle with the government for the distribution of free Aids drugs. This victory, said one of the articles, was deeply damaging to Rath and his colleague Anthony Brink, a barrister and former spokesman for Rath's organisation who actively campaigns against anti-retroviral drugs.</p> <p>Rath wanted to exclude from the court's consideration part of one of Goldacre's articles, which mentioned Brink's attempt to have Achmat indicted for genocide at the international criminal court in The Hague. In February, Mr Justice Tugendhat ruled that the entire article must be considered. Had the case proceeded, the court would have been presented with details of Brink's complaint to The Hague, which called for Achmat to be permanently confined \"in a small white and concrete cage, bright fluorescent light on all the time to keep an eye on him\" and force-fed his Aids drugs or, \"if he bites, kicks and screams too much, dripped into his arm after he's been restrained on a gurney with cable tied around his ankles, wrists and neck\". The complaint was described by the Rath Foundation in January last year as \"entirely valid and long overdue\".</p> <p>Rath, who describes himself as German-born though is also listed as Dutch in Companies House documents, began operating in South Africa in 2004.</p> <p>In a pattern that has been repeated in other countries, he began by running newspaper adverts attacking the pharmaceutical industry and promoting natural remedies for diseases. Eventually he was stopped by the South African advertising standards authority for making unsubstantiated claims about the benefits of vitamins in the treatment of Aids.</p> <p>In 2005, Rath began to offer his nutritional supplement VitaCell to people with Aids in Khayelitsha, a township outside Cape Town. He claims he was running a trial, that participants were suffering from advanced Aids and that none were on or had been on anti-retroviral drugs. Some died, however, and relatives have given statements claiming that some of them had been on ARVs but were told to stop using them.</p> <p>In June this year, TAC won a ruling from the high court that the trial was illegal. VitaCell was being promoted as a medicine, the court said, and therefore it needed permission. The court also ruled that the South African government had breached the law by not clamping down on unlicensed remedies. Rath has been given permission to appeal against this ruling.</p> <p>The Rath Foundation recently expanded its reach into Russia, where Aids has been on the increase. In an advertisement in Izvestia in February, Rath attacked the pharmaceutical industry and suggested that heart attacks, strokes and cancers could be cut to a fraction of the present level through \"natural health approaches\".</p>",
  "<p>While John McCain campaigns far away from Washington, his Senate colleagues are quietly crafting an energy deal that could give his rival Barack Obama a boost of momentum in the election's final days.</p> <p>The energy pact was first sealed by 10 senators, all of them concerned that the bitter political stalemate over offshore oil drilling had drowned out any dialog over diversifying American energy sources. </p> <p>The senators drew up a plan that included concessions for both right and left: Republicans got new coastal oil drilling in four eastern states and the Gulf of Mexico, while Democrats got to keep the ban on drilling in Alaska's Arctic wildlife refuge and more green energy incentives.</p> <p>\"We've tried to address all of the above\" when it comes to increasing energy availability, Republican senator Saxby Chambliss, an original backer of the deal, said today. \"Obviously, you're going to get a lot of criticism when you do that.\"</p> <p>At first the deal got plenty of criticism, from environmentalists and pro-business conservatives alike, and little traction on Capitol Hill. </p> <p>But as high gas prices pushed economic anxiety to the forefront of the campaign season, more and more senators signed on. Obama offered his cautious endorsement last month.</p> <p>The \"gang of 10\", as the dealmakers called themselves, became 16, and today a \"gang of 20\" \u2013 with one senator jokingly offering a gang sign of three fingers in the air, to form an E for energy. </p> <p>The plan's biggest opponent remains McCain, whose camp disapproves of its tax increases on oil companies to offset its $84bn price tag. No less a conservative elder than Rush Limbaugh warned McCain's fellow Republicans not to back the deal out of \"stupidity\" and \"selfishness\".</p> <p>But even Joseph Lieberman, the former Democrat who is one of McCain's closest allies, is warming to the energy plan. \"I think we've got a fighting chance of getting something done here,\" he told the Hartford Courant newspaper yesterday.</p> <p>Perhaps recognising the benefit of increasing pressure on McCain, Democratic leaders are now likely to hold a vote on the plan next week. \"No one expects the product of their work to be perfect,\" Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said today. \"Compromise never is.\" </p> <p>At a congressional energy summit on Capitol Hill today, the energy deal's supporters got advice from clean-tech and energy experts on both sides of the ideological spectrum.</p> <p>Dan Reicher, the director of energy at Google and a member of the group Clean Tech for Obama, told the senators that no option to increase energy supplies \u2013 even oil drilling \u2013 should be refused. </p> <p>\"We do need to do everything,\" he said, adding a meaningful caveat: \"If I had to weight this, I'd say there's a big opportunity to first cut demand, so it's traditional or alternative supplies that we meet that demand with.\"</p> <p>Members of the \"gang of 20\" used the energy summit to tout their plan, displaying confidence in its ability to win Senate approval before this year's session ends in two weeks.</p> <p>The prospect of isolating McCain from fellow Republicans who support the deal, with Obama lending his support for the compromise, could entice even more Democrats to come on board.</p> <p>Even if the pact can pass, however, it would still have a long way to go before becoming law. Approval would still be required in the House of Representatives, where liberals and conservatives have a stronger pull on their respective parties and could unite to bring down the plan.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7609487.stm\">expulsion</a> of the US ambassador to Bolivia by the country's President Evo Morales represents a further escalation of the country's crisis that some are predicting could result in civil war.</p> <p>Bolivia has seen large and increasingly violent protests in recent weeks by Morales' political opponents in the east of the country. These had previously held a series of referendums supporting autonomy for their regions, which Morales has denounced as illegal. He convincingly won a recall referendum on a new constitution last month, but most of his opponents were also re-elected to their positions as regional governors from where they continue to challenge his authority.</p> <p>This week anti-Morales protesters blockaded roads and begin to occupy factories calling for greater autonomy as well as more control over revenues of natural gas in their areas. The government has sent the military to protect gas fields and infrastructure from demonstrators. On Wednesday a pipeline was bombed by saboteurs, forcing them to cut natural gas exports to neighbouring Brazil by 10%. </p> <p>The struggle pits Bolivia's poor indigenous majority against richer Bolivians of European origin. Although a minority in the country as a whole, these form a majority in the eastern provinces, which are also where the country's gas reserves are concentrated. They object to Mr Morales' plans to give more power to the country's indigenous and poor communities by carrying out land reform and redistributing gas revenues. </p> <p>Two years ago Morales <a href=\"http://commentisfree.theguardian.com/john_crabtree/2006/05/bolivias_gas_grab.html\">sent troops</a> to occupy a number of foreign-owned oil companies in the eastern region and announced that he was nationalising them. He called for an end to \"the pillage of our natural resources by foreign companies\" and said that the resources should be used for the benefit of the Bolivian people. His main target was the <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/may/05/boliviatheviewfrombrazil\">Brazilian</a> <br>state-owned company Petrobras, which had invested $1bn in Bolivia and promptly announced that it was suspending future plans.</p> <p>Brazil is the main consumer of Bolivian gas and Morales's move led to a rift with Brazil's President Lula, although the two have since settled their differences. However, the eastern secessionists pose a significant threat to Morales's position and his expulsion of the US ambassador further raises the temperature. In a speech yesterday Morales said: \"The ambassador of the United States is conspiring against democracy and wants Bolivia to break apart.\"</p> <p>The US government has denounced the charge as \"baseless\", but the war of words points to a further ideological polarisation, which is radicalising both sides. Morales has already rejected the rejected the idea of a free trade agreement (FTA) with the US to replace the current trading arrangements and has signed deals with Cuba and Venezuela instead. As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/enriquemendizabal\">Enrique Mendizabal</a> has pointed out this makes little sense from an economic standpoint and is likely to leave the Bolivian economy increasingly reliant on the profits of its natural gas sector to subsidise government expenditure and cash transfers.<br> While <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gott\">Richard Gott</a> has rightly slammed the opposition groups as elitist, anti-democratic and in some cases overtly racist, it would be wrong to underestimate the threat that they potentially pose to Bolivia's government or how damaging the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/12/bolivia.usa\">latest stand-off</a> could be to the country.</p>",
  "<p>While plenty of people somewhere in the US support Sarah Palin, there are also plenty of us for whom she has inspired new-found depths of loathing. Thank God that Charlie Gibson, in as professional a manner as possible, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/11/sarah-palins-charlie-gibs_n_125772.html\">showed her up</a> for the moron that she is. (As Press Box columnist Jack Schafer so succinctly <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2199999/\">put it</a>: \"Never mind about [Palin] not being ready to be president. She wasn't even ready for this interview.\"</p> <p>But is that even going to register with the other half of the country\u2014those people who have given Palin such a boost in the opinion polls? Considering that this election is <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/09/mccain_manager_this_election_i.html\">not about issues, but about image</a>, to paraphrase Rick Davis, a top McCain adviser, I fear it may not. </p> <p>Because really, even before the interview, there was just so much to dislike about her \u2014 and McCain too. By choosing the dimwit from Wasilla, the Republican presidential hopeful signalled his disrespect for women: Did he really think we'd vote for her just because she happens to have certain anatomical parts? He also signalled his alarming disregard for the country at large: Does he really think someone with little experience outside of Alaska \u2014 a sleazy opportunist with questionable ethics and poor diplomatic skills who clearly had <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/11/palins-abc-interview-stum_n_125818.html\">no idea</a>, last night, what the Bush doctrine was \u2014 will be able to lead if he's unable to?</p> <p>But really, it's the \"hockey mom\" who is so stubbornly \u2014 and smugly \u2014 anti-intellectual that I really want to eviscerate here, so let me stick to enumerating her many failings.</p> <p>First, and perhaps most importantly \u2014 not to mention unassailably \u2014 in addition to being an anti-intellectual, she's an anti-politician. Rather than being able to bridge any partisan divides, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/04/us/politics/04alaska.html?pagewanted=1\">she created enemies left and right</a> \u2014 on both the left and the right \u2014 in her home state. A number of local Republicans have spoken out against her, emphasizing her unwillingness to engage with anyone who doesn't share her point-of-view. If she couldn't even win over the Republicans in her home state, how are we supposed to believe she can help to improve what McCain referred to as the \"bipartisan rancour\" of things on Capitol Hill? How are we supposed to believe she will be able to charm foreign leaders from countries she <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0808/Palins_travels.html\">probably knows nothing about</a>, whose language she literally and figuratively will not be able to speak?</p> <p>There's also the problem of her being an anti-feminist, who doesn't think women should be able to control their own bodies \u2014 or their lives. (Which is to say she <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/30/johnmccain.palin2\">opposes abortion</a>, even in the case of rape and incest.)</p> <p>She's <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/05/opinion/05palin.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss\">anti-polar bear</a>: She wants to take the animal off the endangered species list.</p> <p>She's anti-science. A creationist, she believes in Intelligent Design \u2014 which implies she <a href=\"http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/08/mccains-vp-want.html\">doesn't \"believe\"</a> in the scientifically-proven phenomenon known as evolution. And \u2014 again, despite scientific evidence \u2014 she thinks <a href=\"http://www.newsmax.com/headlines/sarah_palin_vp/2008/08/29/126139.html\">humankind has no impact on climate change</a>.</p> <p>For a person with so many bozo opinions, it's ironic to note that she is also opposed to free speech: As mayor of Wasilla \u2014 the town that didn't have quite 6,000 inhabitants when she presided over it \u2014 she <a href=\"http://frontiersman.com/articles/2008/09/08/breaking_news/doc48c1c8a60d6d9379155484.txt\">discussed banning books</a> with the city librarian (who told her, in no uncertain terms, that she would fight tooth and nail if it came to that).</p> <p>In movies, it's usually the villains \u2014 the overly stern headmasters, the evil stepmother, the cruel prison guards \u2014 who try to limit the reading materials of the people whose lives they unfortunately control. In real life, it's usually the genocidal dictators like Hitler and Mao Zedong. They know that people with knowledge are powerful and won't put up with their tyranny for very long. (Kind of like Sarah Palin's God, in the Garden of Eden, didn't want Adam and Eve to eat the apple and become smarter than He was.)</p> <p>Unfortunately, it seems, approximately half of the United States could care less about knowledge or basic intelligence. If they cared, they wouldn't be in favour of someone as ignorant as Palin. And yet, they seem to like her in part because she is an anti-intellectual \u2014 which they think makes her \"one of them\". (Ask how many Alaskans think she is one of them, and I'd bet you'd get a surprising answer, given how many local leaders have had <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/washingtondc/la-na-palinstyle8-2008sep08,0,1799574,full.story\">negative things to say about her</a>.)</p> <p>We've had the ignoramus George Bush in the White House for eight years because too many Americans voted for that anti-intellectual. The last thing we need now is another arrogant, self-satisfied, inexperienced puppet in the White House. Come on, my fellow Americans who are backing Palin. It's time to wise up.</p> <p>Although, of course I'm not entirely against the former beauty pageant contestant. If she wants to run for Miss Wasilla again, I'd be more than happy to support her. And in fact, I even think she'd be capable of doing a more serious job\u2014which is why I'm going to join the Facebook group \"Sarah Palin for Deputy Undersecretary of Agriculture, Wolf/Moose Affairs.\" Just don't put her in charge of polar bears.</p>",
  "<p>Fox News host Bill O'Reilly was cutting in his disapproval after Jamie Lynn Spears, the 16-year-old sister of pop star Britney, announced her pregnancy last year. So plenty of sharp-eared bloggers were ready <a href=\"http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2008/09/bill-oreilly-might-want-to-rethink-this/\">to call him out</a> when O'Reilly cautioned this month against judging the family of Sarah Palin in the wake of her teenage daughter Bristol's pregnancy.</p> <p>If O'Reilly considered young Spears' parents \"pinheads\" who have \"little control over\" their daughter, what made Palin's situation different?

I stand by that remark. There's no evidence that the Palins did not supervise their daughter or their other children.</p> </blockquote> <p>Without pulling the younger Palin back into any campaign discussion, I can't help but wonder: Is O'Reilly saying teenage pregnancy is fine as long as it's parentally sanctioned?</p>",
  "<p>Matthias Rath <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/12/matthiasrath.aids2\">today pulled out</a> of a legal case against the Guardian which has cost the organisation \u00a3500,000 to defend. I am proud that we fought it. Rath is an example of the worst excesses of the alternative therapy industry; UK nutritionists make foolish claims on poor evidence \u2013 they can make your child a genius with fish oils, or prevent heart attacks in the distant future \u2013 but Rath transplanted these practices into the world of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/feb/17/badscience.uknews\">HIV/Aids</a>, where evidence really matters. </p> <p>The potential consequences of his actions are outrageous, but he is by no means untypical. This sector has engineered a beneficent public image for itself, a warm and friendly cottage industry; but that fantasy is not borne out by the facts.</p> <p>First, despite claims about the true evils of \"big pharma\", presented as if they were evidence that vitamin pills are effective, there is little difference between the vitamin and pharmaceutical industries. Key players in both include multinationals such as Roche and Aventis; BioCare, the vitamin pill producer that media nutritionist Patrick Holford works for, is part-owned by Elder Pharmaceuticals, and so on. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/15/3\">food supplement market</a>, comprising products like vitamin pills and herbal supplements, is worth $50bn worldwide (against $600bn for pharmaceuticals). It has lobbied angrily and successfully against safety regulation, and the vitamin industry is also legendary in the world of economics as the setting of the most outrageous price-fixing cartel ever documented: during the 1990s the main offenders pleaded guilty and had to pay $1.5bn, the largest criminal fine levied in legal history. </p> <p>That's quite some cottage industry, and it is tightly linked to the \"nutritional therapists\" community. Bant, their UK membership organisation, recently changed its code of conduct in accordance with the wishes of pill manufacturers, so that members can now take undisclosed financial kickbacks for the pills they prescribe to patients. Doctors are struck off the GMC register for this activity, and rightly so. </p> <p>Last year I went to a public meeting hosted by Matthias Rath in east London. He spoke for three gruelling hours, and every time he mentioned the side-effects of a treatment prescribed by doctors, the people in the seats behind me growled the word \"murderers\" in a venomous tone. Their hatred was intense, and it was unnerving to sit near them. </p> <p>How do people become so extreme in their views? How have they been isolated from the realities of the miracle cure industries? A combination of wishful thinking, successful PR, and legal muscle. </p> <p>When I attempted simply to write that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/31/sciencenews.blogging\">Dore miracle cure</a> for dyslexia had not cured three people, we received several legal warning letters, delaying the piece by a month. An academic who dared to criticise the evidence base for the programme received a threatening legal letter delivered by hand to her home address. </p> <p>Gillian McKeith has made <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/feb/12/advertising.food\">repeated legal threats</a> against websites who have dared to discuss her work, and her lawyer husband has threatened an academic who suggested testing her ideas. She also has a legal case hanging over the Sun that has seen little movement in three years. </p> <p>When chiropractors had their practices challenged in the New Zealand Medical Journal they simply sent a threatening legal letter (\"Let's hear your evidence,\" said the editorial in response, \"not your legal muscle\"). A herbal pill entrepreneur \u2013 and academic \u2013 had Professor David Colquhoun's website removed from UCL servers after he dared to question her evidence. The Society of Homeopaths had a blogger silenced by threatening his web host. </p> <p>I could go on. And of course, deterring dissent goes wider than the use of libel law. There is also the bizarre smear operation against critics of the food supplement industry, and an elaborate campaign conducted by homeopaths against Professor Edzard Ernst, an academic who has simply dared to examine the evidence for their claims, which ended up with his employers at Exeter University being harassed to silence him. </p> <p>Meanwhile the alternative therapists who run university BSc courses refuse to release their lecture notes, or let anyone see their exam papers, in a desperate attempt not to engage with critical appraisal from the worlds of scientific evidence of which they purport to be a part. </p> <p>This is not just unpleasant, it is also unhealthy. Ideas improve when they are challenged and questioned. I am a doctor, journalist and academic. I criticise the activities of doctors, journalists and academics in each of my jobs, and I welcome other people criticising my ideas. </p> <p>Nothing could be more anti-democratic or stifling to debate than using money, law and power to regulate what can be discussed, and yet those who do it have the gall to represent themselves as the outsider, the little man, concerned with the medicine of the people. In reality they behave like nothing more than commercial entities. </p> <p>The food supplement pill industry is phenomenally powerful, extremely lucrative and incredibly influential, but it has shown itself to be philosophically and commercially incapable of critical self-appraisal. Rath is its product. It is inconceivable that any individual within that industry would be brave enough to stand up and criticise his activities \u2013 and for that, more than anything else, it should be condemned.</p> <p>Ben Goldacre, a medical doctor and author of the book Bad Science, writes the Bad Science column in the Guardian<br>bad.science@theguardian.com</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337554661\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1790935088_gdn-nat-080912-sf-rath-01-VFa-4x3.flv\"/> </video>   <p>It was billed as a victory rally and held in Old Billingsgate, on the edge of the Thames and in the heart of historical London. </p> <p>Fliers were dropped through thousands of letterboxes, inviting people to \"celebrate a turning point in medical history\". </p> <p>A charismatic figure with prematurely white hair was spotlit on the podium in a darkened Grand Hall on the night of March 24 last year.</p> <p>His impassioned oratorical skills were such that the several hundred people in the audience seemed enthralled as he denounced modern medicines, accused the pharmaceutical industry of murderous intent and hailed vitamins and minerals as the cure for all diseases. </p> <p>The man was Matthias Rath, the vitamin salesman who has been accused of endangering the lives of Aids sufferers in South Africa and who was embarking on a further chapter in his business plan.</p> <p>Rath, who says he was born in Germany - although documents he filed at Companies House say he is Dutch - obtained his basic medical degree in 1985 after studying in Munster and Hamburg. </p> <p>The 53-year-old first became a researcher at the University Clinic, in Hamburg, and then, during 1989 and 1990, at the Berlin Heart Centre.</p> <p>After this, however, Rath followed a path that led him to repudiate modern medicine and set himself up as the guru of a movement claiming it could cure all the world's diseases with simple concoctions of micronutrients - vitamin and mineral pills which he sells across the globe through the website of the Dr Rath Foundation.</p> <p>He then left Germany to work at the Linus Pauling Institute in California. </p> <p>Pauling, the then 89-year-old double Nobel Prize winner - for chemistry in 1954 and peace in 1962 - was convinced that vitamins and minerals could cure diseases. Towards the end of his life (he died in 1994) he attempted to prove that high dose vitamin C could kill cancer.</p> <p>Among the claims on Rath's website and in all his publicity materials is his assertion that Pauling chose him as his successor. </p> <p>Those at the institute in the 90s say Pauling may have thought of Rath as a leader in the context of micronutrients, but no more than that.</p> <p>They also say the Nobel Laureate always said it was not for him, but for the institute, to decide his successor. </p> <p>Not long after Pauling's death, in what was to become a long chapter of legal actions against his critics around the world, Rath sued the institute for interfering with his business relationships. </p> <p>He lost, and the institute counter-sued for libel and interfering in its business relationships. The case was settled out of court in 1994, and all agreements between Pauling and Rath were nullified. Rath was assigned some patents and ordered to pay the institute $75,000.</p> <p>By now, he had his own self-styled foundation, which he claimed to be non profit-making and seeking donations for research, although it is thought to make millions from sales of his products. </p> <p>His basic health formula, called Vitacor Plus in the UK and dispatched from a trading estate in Slough, was selling last year to those who attended the Billingsgate rally at \u00a326.50 for 90 pills.</p> <p>He set up in the UK early on, as Matthias Rath Ltd, with a registered address in Guildford, Surrey, in July 1998.</p> <p>The business was categorised as \"manufacture of other food products\". Rath, declaring Dutch nationality and an address in the Netherlands, was a director, and the company is still active.</p> <p>In 2000, however, he fell foul of the Advertising Standards Authority over a newsletter with the heading: \"GOOD HEALTH - do it yourself\".</p> <p>The newsletter claimed his vitamins could prevent a range of conditions from heart attacks to strokes and high blood pressure. </p> <p>Two years later, the ASA made a second ruling. This time, it was against a claim published in Britain by a California-based organisation called the \"Health4Us Foundation\", which appeared to provide publicity for the Rath Foundation, that Rath's \"remarkable natural approach is capable of controlling the spread of cancerous cells in the human body without damaging healthy cells\".</p> <p>Other rulings have followed. In the same year, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US ordered Rath to take his unproven therapeutic claims for Vitacor Plus and Diacor off his website.</p> <p>In 2003, the regional court in Berlin banned him from calling himself \"the renowned doctor\" and/or \"the renowned scientist\" in his adverts following a court case in which medical and scientific witnesses said he was neither. </p> <p>In the same year, Rath's theories and micronutrients were disavowed by the respected and influential Swiss Study Group for Complementary and Alternative Methods in Cancer.</p> <p>\"After examining the literature and other available information,\" it said, it had \"found no proof that the vitamin preparations of Dr Matthias Rath have any effect on human cancer\".</p> <p>It advised \"against their use in cancer prevention and treatment while recommending a diet rich in fruit and vegetables\".</p> <p>In Germany, the distressing case of a young boy with cancer was making headlines in 2003. </p> <p>Nine-year-old Dominik Feld had bone cancer, but his parents would not accept doctors' decision that his leg would have to be amputated to save his life. </p> <p>His chances of surviving with chemotherapy were one in five, his consultant said, and his parents, Josef and Anke Feld, opted for Rath's natural remedies instead. </p> <p>A protracted legal tussle ensued as social services obtained an order for the boy to be taken into care and the parents succeeded in a high court action to regain custody of their child. </p> <p>At rallies and demonstrations outside every court hearing, protesters demanded the parents' right to continue giving the child Rath's \"cell therapy\".</p> <p>Rath claims the boy got better, but clinicians say the cancer spread and he was returned to hospital for further treatment. Eventually, his parents flew him to an alternative therapy clinic in Mexico, where he died in November 2004.</p> <p>That year, Rath turned up in South Africa, the country worst-hit by the Aids epidemic. It had a long tradition of the use of herbal and traditional remedies and a government that was prevaricating over the introduction of Aids medicines.</p> <p>The president, Thabo Mbeki, had outraged the global medical establishment by publicly voicing his doubts over both the disease and its treatment. He had flirted with Aids deniers in the US, who say there is no proof that a virus causes Aids.</p> <p>Mbeki preferred to view Aids as a disease of poverty, which required economic development, and not the expensive drugs, with unpleasant side-effects, that were by then keeping those with HIV alive in rich countries.</p> <p>Rath followed his usual modus operandi - prominent adverts were placed in influential newspapers, denouncing the profit-hungry pharmaceutical industry and suggesting that natural remedies would heal the world. </p> <p>But, as elsewhere, South African advertising standards officials instructed newspapers not to run the ads, although some disobeyed.</p> <p>By 2005, Rath had forged an alliance with Sanco, the South African National Civic Organisation. </p> <p>Sanco's operatives were handing out vitamins to people with Aids in the township of Khayelitsha and also - according to Rath's own account - Western Cape and KwaZuluNatal.</p> <p>The Treatment Action Campaign, which was gradually making progress in its fight for free Aids drugs for South Africans, was appalled at the claims Rath was making - that vitamins could reverse the course of Aids - and the discovery that some people had stopped taking Aids medicines in favour of his VitaCell product. </p> <p>Doctors working for Medecins Sans Frontieres, which opened the first clinic offering free antiretrovirals in the country in Khayelitsha, testified that some patients had died. </p> <p>To add to the anxiety, Rath had been seen with the health minister, Manto Tshabala Msimang, who was later to back the healing properties of lemon, garlic and beetroot over ARVs. </p> <p>There were suspicions that Rath was hoping for a government contract to provide vitamins to Aids sufferers.</p> <p>Rath said he was carrying out a study. He has now published results on his website, claiming 748 patients received VitaCell. </p> <p>He says all had advanced Aids and none were on antiretroviral drugs, although there is sworn testimony that some were and had stopped taking the drugs. Rath claims the symptoms of the participants universally improved.</p> <p>TAC took an action against Rath to the courts and, in June this year, won a ruling that the study was illegal because it did not have approval to use a product with a claimed therapeutic effect. </p> <p>The court also ruled that the South African government had breached the law by failing to clamp down on those peddling unlicensed remedies. </p> <p>Rath is now appealing against the South African decision, while expanding his global reach. </p> <p>The victory rally in Billingsgate was funded by the \u00a3100,000 proceeds of a legal action against the British Medical Journal, which made an error in its coverage of the Feld case. </p> <p>Rath used his Billingsgate lecture to lambest the BMJ and launch a personal attack on its editor, accusing the magazine of hiding \"the scientific facts about the health benefits of vitamins\".</p> <p>The Rath Foundation website is now available in 17 languages. It is proactive in eight countries - the US, the UK, South Africa, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Spain and, most recently, Russia. </p> <p>In a repeat of the characteristic pattern, a large advertisement, looking very much like editorial, appeared in Izvestia in February under the heading: \"Russia can become a healthcare model for the world\". </p> <p>While Russia is under threat from the US and parts of western Europe, the greatest threat to world peace is the drug industry, it says. </p> <p>But, it adds, Russia has the opportunity to reduce common diseases, such as cancer, heart disease and strokes, to a fraction of the present level - through natural health approaches.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/kbank/profiles/jaruzelski/\">Wojciech Jaruzelski</a> cuts a dignified, vulnerable figure these days, living in quiet retirement at the age of 84. At first sight the decision by Polish prosecutors to put him on <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5grOmEVUhtPUMjamLmqIKRUQa2BxAD9354IB00\">trial</a> for his role in declaring martial law in December 13, 1981 looks vindictive. True, it ended the intoxicating era of freedom created by the Solidarity trade union movement, which had jemmied open the communist party's grip on power. But it prevented a far more traumatic outcome: full-blown Soviet invasion. And it was also the Jaruzelski government that enabled Poland's lasting return to democracy in 1989, with the round table talks in which the communist regime negotiated its own peaceful demise.</p> <p>Yet General Jaruzelski did not seem a dignified, vulnerable, altruistic figure in the terrifying days after 1981. Along with other activists in \"Solidarity with Solidarity\" I shivered outside the Polish embassy in London, chanting \"Bez solidarnosci nie ma wolnosci\" (No freedom without solidarity). We knew that many of our friends in Poland were on the run or among the thousands interned. Dozens of Polish patriots were beaten to death by riot police and other goons. In their search for informants, the secret police used their habitually nasty tactics to turn sister against brother, husband against wife, parent against child. The trauma and distrust of martial law and its aftermath still poisons public life in Poland today. </p> <p>It would be quite wrong to portray Jaruzelski simply as a victim of events, let alone a patriotic altruist. Other Poles in high positions under communism faced tough choices too \u2013 and chose differently. Colonel <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/ryszard-kuklinski-549438.html\">Ryszard Kuklinski</a>, another Polish officer, chose to spy for the west \u2013 and gave warning of the plans for martial law. Whether he was a hero or a traitor is still a divisive question in Poland today.</p> <p>It would also be wrong to see the round table talks as an unqualified success. From the point of view of many Poles today, the negotiations were unfair and the result a shameful fudge, in which weak-willed opposition leaders (some of them with a dodgy past and open to blackmail) allowed the communist usurpers to make a sham departure from power. Some 20 years later, it is remarkable how well the old regime has fared in Poland, particularly in business but also in politics. </p> <p>Reasonable people can disagree about how harshly to judge the past. Writing off the whole of communist rule in Poland as illegitimate is not as tidy as it seems. Real people lived real lives and had real achievements. Even the most hawkish Poles do not say that the university degrees they gained under communism were valueless.</p> <p>But a couple of things are clear. At least Poland is debating its past, and the difficult calculus between justice and mercy. That is a sharp contrast with modern Russia, where the regime is busily obfuscating history: producing a <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/08/31/europe/stalin.php\">new textbook</a> for example, which makes Stalin out to be a tough-minded leader who made difficult decisions for what he thought was the good of the country. Secondly, prosecution is not guilt. Jaruzelski will have a chance to put his side of the argument. The prosecutors will put theirs. If he dislikes the verdict, he can appeal. If voters don't like the outcome, they can elect representatives who can change the law. That is how things are supposed to work \u2013 and that's just what didn't happen during the years Jaruzelski was in power.</p>",
  "<p>Malaysia's most prominent political blogger was arrested today at his home for posting anti-government comments on the <a href=\"http://mt.m2day.org/2008\">Malaysia Today</a> website.</p> <p>Raja Petra Kamarudin, the British-born founder and editor of the site, could be detained indefinitely without trial under an emergency law brought in after a series of attacks on senior political figures.</p> <p>\"They came here and arrested him under the internal security act (ISA) for inciting hate in his articles on Islam,\" his wife, Marina Le Abdullah, told foreign press agencies.</p> <p>A statement on Malaysia Today said police \"ransacked RPK's bedroom and took away some documents and CDs\".</p> <p>Hours later, police made a second arrest. Tan Hoon Cheng, a Chinese reporter, was detained under the ISA in connection with comments in the Sin Chew Daily, where he reported that a member of the ruling party had referred to ethnic Chinese as \"squatters\".</p> <p>The Malaysian home minister, Syed Hamid Albar, said authorities had been forced to act because Raja Petra had written numerous allegedly offensive pieces, including one that was claimed to ridicule Islam. \"We have called and advised him many times about his statements, but he still continues writing in a way that could pose a threat,\" the minister told the national Bernama news agency.</p> <p>Two weeks ago, authorities blocked the Malaysia Today website, in a move that was met with outrage from journalists and bloggers worldwide. Raja Petra continued to publish online via an alternative link.</p> <p>On September 6, he predicted his arrest, saying he had been told by friends that he would be detained under the ISA if he persisted. His arrest came a day after the Malaysia Today block was lifted.</p> <p>Articles calling for the release of Raja Petra and condemning the ISA have appeared on the site. Amnesty International urged the Malaysian government to revoke the ISA, under which more than 60 people are being held.</p> <p>\"The Malaysian government is using this law as a repressive measure to control dissent,\" said Donna Guest, the organisation's deputy Asia-Pacific director. \"It should be revoked immediately, and Raja Petra, along with those others currently being held in indefinite detention, should be either charged with an offence and brought to fair trial or released immediately.\"</p> <p>One blogger called for peaceful demonstrations and \"planned vigils\" to be held on September 15 in a show of support. </p> <p>In May, Raja Petra was charged with sedition for allegedly implying that the deputy prime minister was involved in the killing of a Mongolian woman. His trial is due to begin in October.<br> There is increasing political tension in Malaysia, with threats by the leader of the country's resurgent opposition, Anwar Ibrahim, to take power by September 16 - Malaysia's national day.</p> <p>In March, the ruling National Front party, led by Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, lost its two-thirds majority as opposition parties made big gains in parliamentary elections. Abdullah has been in power since 2003.</p>",

It's first game - a stunning 3D beat-em-up - <a href=\"http://www.plainsightgame.com\">Plain Sight</a>, is soon to be released on the Xbox 360. It focusses on the Machiavellian tendencies of a little sword-wielding robot with suicidal tendencies. I spoke with Beatnik's Robin Lacy to find about the joys of the Microsoft's free XNA development platform - a boon for indie developers - the relative merits of Xbox360 distribution over PC, and more.<br><br><strong>Explain your game to my mum in 140 words.</strong><br>Plain Sight is a game about cute robots, flaming swords and blowing yourself up. The basic rules are simple: You're a little robot and you start with one point - that's pretty rubbish, so you want more. To get more points you have to steal them off other players \u2013 this you do by killing them with your sword. The more points you steal the bigger, faster and generally better you are. However the points only count toward your final score if you blow yourself up. The more you take out, the higher your banked score.</p> <p>Respawn and repeat.</p> <p>Think of it as 'The Weakest Link' with suicidal sword wielding robots.<br>Plain Sight is written in XNA, which means it works on both PC and Xbox 360. We're going to be having an open beta in mid November for the PC.<br> <br><strong>How do players control the game?</strong> <br>The game is playable with an Xbox 360 controller or a mouse and keyboard.<br> <br><strong>What is your background?</strong><br>No-one at Beatnik Games has much experience in the videogame industry and we're all relatively young.<br> <br>Well, the development team all have academic experience, but as everyone is pretty young we're virtually new to the world of game creation at a professional level. I'm not worried though, because it's really given us the drive to make something special and show that, by approaching the industry with a full set of fresh eyes, we can actually gain a huge advantage.<br> <br><strong>Name your competitors.</strong><br>The indie games scene is great, there's no in-fighting or anything like that, and everyone is incredibly supportive; so, from that perspective, we have no competitors. However, if you're looking at the whole games industry as a food chain, we're very much at the bottom of it, so everyone's a competitor.<br> <br><strong>How many players do you have now and what's your target in 12 months?</strong><br>The response already has been staggering. I don't want to jinx ourselves by predicting sales figures but, from what we've seen from the beta-test applications, we're feeling optimistic.<br> <br><strong>What's your biggest challenge?</strong><br>Writing our game engine from scratch. We decided early on that we were going to write the core game software ourselves. This gave us much greater control over what the Plain Sight would be capable of and allows us to focus on what features were important to the game. Unfortunately, it's incredibly hard and takes a great deal of time. Once it's all done, we (thankfully) won't have to go through all that again for the next game!<br> <br><strong>What's the weirdest development experience you've had thus far?</strong><br>We recently had a very bizarre bug where walking the character slowly over the edge of a building would turn everything a bit yellow and send you falling through the world. We eventually tracked the problem to corrupt data in the character model, but it was pretty worrying for about an hour and definitely very weird.<br> <br><strong>Are indie games the latest killer app?</strong><br>I think indie games fill a void in the current game market. Currently the multi-national developers spend a great deal of time and money re-hashing old IP's and game concepts. Indie game studios are usually much more experimental and more willing to take risks. The console manufacturers realise this and have spent a great deal of time encouraging the development of smaller games.</p> <p>For example, Microsoft has a new 'community games' initiative where anyone can upload their game to Xbox 360. They've also provided a free development platform called XNA which we have used to make Plain Sight; without XNA we'd have to spend many thousands of pounds on a development kit.<br> <br><strong>What's your distribution/publishing plan?</strong><br>We're currently spending nearly all our time on the PC port. The PC platform is the easiest to publish for as you either have the option to self publish (through your own website) or use one of the many online publishing platforms (such as steam or gametap). We haven't yet decided which will be best for us.</p> <p>As the game is XNA and compatible with Xbox 360 we'll obviously be looking into XBLA or Microsoft's community games initiative.<br> <br><strong>Are you the next big thing?</strong><br>Maybe the next big small thing will do for now.</p>",
  "<p>Even before his arrest, Malaysia's most political blogger, Raja Petra Kamarudin, was attracting hundreds of readers to <a href=\"http://mt.m2day.org/2008/\">Malaysia Today</a>, a website renowned for its controversial articles and slurs on various political figures. </p> <p>Raja Petra predicted his own arrest on the site. When his prophecy <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/12/malaysia.pressandpublishing\">came true today</a>, supporters started a flurry of blog posts condemning his detainment. </p> <p>Two weeks ago, the government ordered the Malaysian communications and multimedia commission to shut down Malaysia Today for allegedly inciting hatred of Islam in an article. It is believed this was the first time the government had ordered the closure of a website in the country.</p> <p>Although the block was removed yesterday, Raja Petra has been detained under a colonial-era and draconian law called the internal security act (ISA), which allows for him to be detained indefinitely without trial. </p> <p>Bloggers have called the authorities \"cowards\" and attacked the use of the ISA. Several are planning demonstrations to show their solidarity for Raja Petra.</p> <p>In response, his wife has posted a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJJ8b1g0J5Y&amp;eurl=http://dinmerican.wordpress.com/\">YouTube clip</a> in which she urges supporters to \"give him a prayer\" and \"not to take to the streets\".</p> <p>His arrest has brought to the world's attention a law that Amnesty International has said should be revoked immediately, and is likely to have encouraged those who read Malaysia Today to fight for their rights and voice political concerns. It will be interesting to see for how long Petra Raja will be detained and what will become of Malaysia Today.</p>",
  "<p>The good times rolled last year for top executives in American boardrooms, pocketing solid pay rises in spite of the credit crunch, the sub-prime mortgage crisis and early signs of an economic slump.</p> <p>A veteran Silicon Valley technology entrepreneur topped the remuneration table. Larry Ellison, founder and chief executive of the business software company Oracle, took home $84.6m (\u00a348m).</p> <p>The billionaire America's Cup sailing fanatic fought off stiff competition to take the top-paid title. According to analysis by Associated Press, the 10 highest earners in the US included the bosses of three investment banks \u2014 Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley \u2014 and three energy and mining firms buoyed up by soaring commodity prices.</p> <p>Straitened economic conditions in the US only modestly dented the annual boardroom bonanza. A survey by Hay Group for the Wall Street Journal found compensation rose 3.5% to an average of $8.85m among chief executives of 200 top US corporations. There were few examples, however, of standout pay packages. Nobody made it into nine figures last year unlike, for example, Home Depot's Robert Nardelli who secured a $210m severance package in 2006, or Richard Fairbank of credit card firm Capital One, who scooped $280m in 2005.</p> <p>\"I don't think we've seen any particularly significant cases in the last 12 months,\" said Ryan Johnson of employment consultants WorldatWork. The reason was straightforward \u2014 the stock market had a tough year which meant executive share options fared poorly.</p> <p>\"Most of the major indices were down 10% or 15% which meant you didn't have as much cashing in as usual,\" said Johnson. \"The amount of equity most US executives now have ties their personal compensation to the share price.\"</p> <p>The pay league runner-up was Merrill Lynch's John Thain who got a generous signing-on package when moving from the New York Stock Exchange. Thain received $83.1m despite the bank's losses of $19bn on mortgage-related securities, which have prompted it to sell assets and raise money from Asian sovereign wealth funds.</p> <p>In third place was Leslie Moonves of television network CBS \u2014 the maker of hits such as CSI and Everybody Loves Raymond \u2014 who got $67.6m. Behind him were the bosses of metals group Freeport-McMoRan and energy company XTO.</p> <p>US investors are not entitled to vote on executive pay packages in the way they are in Britain. Efforts to institute a \"say on pay\" vote by shareholders at annual meetings have largely failed, with a few exceptions \u2014 such as at computer maker Apple, telecoms firm Verizon and video rental empire Blockbuster \u2014 where resolutions have passed against the wishes of the board.</p> <p>Several vocal pressure groups continue to push for pay restraint. A report from the US Institute for Policy Studies, together with United for a Fair Economy, this week concluded taxpayers in effect subsidise boardroom pay to the tune of $20bn annually through loopholes allowing companies to pay executives offshore, to minimise capital gains tax or defer taxation.</p> <p>Sarah Anderson, co-author of the study, said the rewards enjoyed by energy bosses were attracting particular ire. \"They've really been cashing in even though executives admit they don't have any control over global oil prices.\" </p> <p>The presidential election has provided hope for campaigners. Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain say they support legislation presently stalled in Congress which would require companies to hold a \"say on pay\" vote annually.</p> <p>Obama favours closing a so-called \"carried interest\" loophole which limits capital gains tax on fees and bonuses. </p> <p>McCain has railed against \"rewards for failure\" when outgoing chief executives get huge payoffs, telling a group of small business leaders in June: \"Something is seriously wrong when the American people are left to bear the consequences of reckless corporate conduct, while the offenders themselves are packed off with another $40m or $50m for the road.\"</p>",
  "<p>Zackie Achmat was 14 when he took his first direct action.</p> <p>It was 1976, and he felt fellow pupils at his \"coloured\", or mixed-race, school (where he was sent because of his Malaysian and Muslim roots) were not sufficiently supportive of the anti-apartheid education boycott spreading from the black townships around Johannesburg. So he set fire to the school and nobody went to classes.</p> <p>Thirty years later, he is still using direct action in pursuit of what he believes is right. </p> <p>In recent years, his struggle has focused on liberating South Africa's poor from what amounted to the death sentence of Aids. </p> <p>The HIV-positive activist founded the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) 10 years ago as a direct challenge to Thabo Mbeki's outlandish views on the causes of Aids and refusal to provide conventional treatment through the public health service despite South Africa having one of the highest HIV infection rates in the world. </p> <p>Achmat was radicalised by his communist father and shop-steward mother in his youth. He was sent to prison for three months after setting the school on fire and, by the time he was 18, had been in and out of jail four times for political activities. </p> <p>With liberation from apartheid \u2014 and about the time he discovered he was HIV-positive \u2014 Achmat founded the National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality which, in the early 1990s, played a central role in ensuring that Calvinist laws banning gay and lesbian sex were overturned in the new constitution. </p> <p>Its guarantees of equality became the levers for overturning laws banning sodomy and requiring the government to recognise same-sex marriages. </p> <p>Then came the TAC. Achmat's anti-apartheid background gave him a legitimacy in criticising the ruling African National Congress leadership despite its attempts to paint him as a stooge of the pharmaceutical industry.</p> <p>TAC began by campaigning to force drug companies to lower their prices. The big US and European manufacturers charged several times the cost of generics from India, but pressured the South African government to block imports of the cheaper drugs.</p> <p>Achmat challenged the ban on generic drugs by flying to Thailand to buy thousands of capsules of Fluconazole, a treatment for thrush, at 4p a capsule. </p> <p>Pfizer was selling its patented version in South Africa for more than \u00a35 a capsule. Achmat was arrested for illegally importing drugs, but the ensuing publicity forced Pfizer to donate its version to public hospitals in South Africa, setting off a wave of price cuts for anti-Aids drugs by other firms. </p> <p>But Achmat's greatest impact has been in leading the campaign that shamed Mbeki and his health minister into putting aside their views on Aids and finally providing the life-saving drugs to the poor. </p> <p>His struggle to see antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) in public hospitals has often been as bitter as his resistance to apartheid. </p> <p>He called the health minister, Dr Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, a murderer for blocking the distribution of anti-Aids drugs. Two years ago, he was arrested for occupying government offices to demand that the minister and others be charged with culpable homicide over the death of an HIV-positive prisoner who was denied ARVs.</p> <p>Achmat's campaign led to him clashing with controversial the vitamin salesman Matthias Rath on numerous occasions, with both men taking legal action against each other. </p> <p>Through all this, he was battling the virus and refusing ARVs until every South African had access to them for free. But when he became seriously ill, Nelson Mandela appealed to him to abandon his pledge, which he did five years ago. </p> <p>In January, Achmat married his partner, Dalli Weyers. An appeal court judge, Edwin Cameron, officiated at the ceremony and the master of ceremonies was Ann Grant, a former British high commissioner to South Africa.*</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> *This article was amended on Wednesday September 17 2008 to remove a reference to Edwin Cameron wearing make-up and to correct his position from high court judge to appeal court judge.</p>",
  "<p>For this Sunday's Observer Music Monthly, I spent time with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/14/folk\">Seasick Steve</a> on his old stomping grounds in Memphis and Clarksdale. I got to thinking about hobo songs, road songs and train songs, what you might call rambling songs. Woody Guthrie came to mind, of course, and Rambling Jack Elliot, and the early, freewheelin' Dylan of 'One Too Many Mornings' and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSGy5Fo049g\">'Don't Think Twice, It's All Right'</a>.</p> <p>When I got home, though, I went searching for Steve Goodman's 'City of New Orleans', which I hadn't heard for years. (Woody Guthrie's son, Arlo, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PBgIcKkSSg\">cut the best-known version</a>, but I've always preferred the original.) It's a windswept ballad about the train of the same name that ran from Chicago to New Orleans: a classic train song, full of place names and the memories that they hold. Lyrically, it carries that sense of freedom tinged with regret that all great rambling songs contain. (It's there in 'On the Road', too, and in Kerouac's great hobo song, 'Home I'll Never Be', which Tom Waits covered on 'Orphans'.) But, 'City of New Orleans' is also a lament for the passing of the era of mass rail travel in America. Or, as Goodman puts it, 'this trains got the disappearin' railroad blues'.</p> <p>I doubt, though, that Goodman, who died in 1984, ever hopped a freight train in his life. He came from a comfortable, middle-class background in north Chicago - a boho, then, rather than a hobo. The song is a testament to his song-writing skill and to the power of his imagination. Which brings us to the vexing question of authenticity. While Seasick Steve is the real deal, whose songs hark back to his years living rough, I would contend that the best hobo song ever was written by Roger Miller, a mid-Sixties smoothie whose forte was novelty hits \u2013 'England Swings' and 'You Can't Roller Skate in a Buffalo Herd' spring to mind. When he sat down to write <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhApYxZisBI\">'King of the Road'</a>, though, he hit lyrical pay dirt. </p> <p>Everything about the song is damn near perfect: the melody, the lyrics, the nonchalant swing in his voice that hits just the right note of defiance and regret. It's a song that possesses the economy and observational eye for detail of a great American short story. And talk about a great opening verse: </p> <p>'Trailers for sale or rent,<br> Rooms to let, fifty cents,<br> No phone, no pool, no pets<br> I ain't got no cigarettes\u2026'</p> <p>It's a song from another time, from Seasick Steve's favourite time, as it turns out. When I mentioned 'King of the Road' to him towards the end of our interview, he started humming it straight away, then rolled into the song about half way though. </p> <p>'I smoke old stogies I have found<br>Short, but not too big around<br>I'm a man of means by no means<br>King of the road.'</p> <p>Steve's face lit up as the lyrics came back to him. </p> <p>'I know every engineer on every train<br>All of their children, and all of their names<br>And every handout in every town<br>And every lock that ain't locked<br>When no one's around\u2026'</p> <p>He slapped his thigh and sipped his whiskey. 'That lasts part's a bit hard,' he said. 'Never done nuthin' like that. Just about everything else that's in the song, though, I've done at one time or another. I've lived that god damn song. That's a hell of a song, man. I love that song. I might just have to do that song at the Albert Hall.'</p> <p>We talked about 'City of New Orleans', too, and about 'Gentle On My Mind', a great rambling song that was written by the neglected John Hartford, and was a big hit for Glen Campbell in 1968. It's also a favourite of Seasick Steve's. 'That's a great hobo song, too,' he said, smiling. 'The words of that song, man, that's it! That's the life right there. I'm sure that song influenced me.' </p> <p>So, there you go, two of the best hobo songs of all, according to Seasick Steve, were written by guys who imagined, rather than led, the life. Go figure. A few hours later, though, when Seasick Steve picked up an acoustic guitar in a friend's living room in Clarksdale, and sang 'King of the Road' and 'Gentle On My Mind', you could tell he's lived them. They became Seasick Steve songs, not rough- and-ready like his country-blues stomps, but intimate, tender-hearted ballads, tinged with longing and regret. When he closed his eyes, I sensed he is singing to himself, his younger, wilder self.</p> <p>It was a real privilege to be there and to hear those songs, and to feel that, in some way, our rambling chat earlier in the evening had been a catalyst for them.</p>",
  "<p>Saudi Arabia's top judiciary official has issued a fatwa authorising the murder of owners of satellite TV networks that broadcast \"bad programmes\".</p> <p>Sheik Saleh al-Lihedan, 79, chief of the kingdom's highest tribunal, the supreme judiciary council, said satellite channels caused the \"deviance of thousands of people\".</p> <p>He was answering listeners' questions during the daily radio programme Light in the Path, in which he and other clerics make rulings on what is permissible under Islamic law. One caller asked yesterday about Islam's view on satellite TV channels that broadcast \"bad programmes\" during Ramadan.</p> <p>\"What does the owner of these networks think, when he provides seduction, obscenity and vulgarity?\" said Al-Lihedan. \"Those calling for corrupt beliefs, certainly it's permissible to kill them. Those calling for sedition, those who are able to prevent it but don't, it is permissible to kill them.\"</p> <p>One of the most viewed Arab satellite networks is Rotana, which broadcasts films and music videos. It is owned by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, a billionaire businessman and member of the Saudi royal family whom Forbes ranks as the world's 13th richest person. Several other networks are owned by Saudi princes. Al-Lihedan did not specify particular channels in his judgment.</p> <p>Fatwas are regularly issued on everyday issues, although they do not have the weight of law.</p> <p>Al-Lihedan sparked controversy previously when he issued a religious decree permitting Saudis to join jihadists to fight US troops in Iraq.</p>",
  "<p>The \"social scourge\" of excessive boardroom pay has prompted widespread debate in the European Union as workers see their purchasing power eroded by \u00adrising prices and low wage increases. European political leaders have demanded a legal and fiscal clampdown.</p> <p>Shareholders, especially retail investors, are pressing for greater corporate disclosure of remuneration policy, inc\u00adlu\u00adding links to performance, and individual directors' pay packages as well as votes on the issue at annual meetings.</p> <p>The pay debate has been exacerbated by the credit crunch, which has exposed undue risk-taking in the search for higher bonuses by highly paid investment bankers and high-profile severance packages for failed executives, deepening the sense of outrage in mainland Europe, which is culturally more egalitarian than the US or Britain.</p> <p>Even before Pat Russo, chief executive of serially loss-making IT firm Alcatel-Lucent, quit in late July with a contractual pay-off of up to \u20ac6m (\u00a34.8m), French president Nicolas Sarkozy had produced draft laws to curb such \"golden parachutes\".</p> <p>The Dutch government has introduced legislation for a 30% tax on bonuses of more than \u20ac500,000 and a 15% increase in employer's fiscal contributions to executive pensions, partly influenced by the multimillion pay-off for ABN Amro chief Rijkman Groenink.</p> <p>In Germany, where workers' pay rose only 4.3% between 2003 and 2007 as firms laid off hundreds of thousands of employees, Social Democrats are demanding a \u20ac1m ceiling on tax-deductible boardroom remuneration.</p> <p>It is the widening gap between boardroom and shopfloor remuneration in a deteriorating economic environment that is fuelling the furore. The growing evidence is that mainland European companies are following the lead of their British counterparts by setting executive remuneration packages, including stock options, at a level commensurate with global \u2014 not national \u2014 peers in an effort to retain and incentivise directors.</p> <p>Executive pay in the EU averages \u20ac5m a year. French chief executives are said to be the highest paid with packages worth \u20ac6m after a reported 58% leap in 2007. A recent survey by the German DSW investor lobby found that German executive pay had risen 7.75% in 2007 to just below \u20ac3m, with Josef Ackermann of Deutsche Bank the top earner with \u20ac14m, though Wendelin Wiedeking of unlisted Porsche earned more than four times that.</p> <p>It is this degree of corporate generosity that prompted Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of the EU's euro group, to label it a \"social scourge\".</p> <p>Disclosure practices vary widely across the European Union despite a four-year-old non-binding European commission recommendation to increase corporate remuneration transparency on individual executive pay and remuneration policies as a whole.</p> <p>A European commission report last year found greater transparency had ensued but responses had been patchy, with only a third of member states enabling even an advisory shareholder vote on executive remuneration. In Germany, where only 40% of the top 30 firms in the Dax have remuneration committees and most annual reports detail just the package of the highest earner, even that stipulation causes anger among directors.</p>",
  "<p>The desire of the Murdochs to keep things in the family means its members appear close to the top of both of the lists for the youngest and oldest directors of Britain's leading companies.</p> <p>James Murdoch is only 35 years old but pulls in \u00a32.9m a year as chief executive of BSkyB, while his 77-year-old father, Rupert, takes home a modest \u00a354,700 for his non-executive role at the same company. His main earnings come from his role as chairman and part-owner of BSkyB's main shareholder, News Corporation.</p> <p>Murdoch junior is beaten in the stakes for the youngest FTSE-100 director only by 32-year-old Alejandro Santo Domingo D\u00e1vila, a non-exec at brewing group SAB Miller, where he receives \u00a355,230.</p> <p>The oldest director in the FTSE 100 is 78-year-old George Mallinckrodt, the head of private banking at Schroders, another company that likes family connections. Mallinckrodt, who earns \u00a3116,000, is joined in the list of elder statesmen by the 76-year-old Eton-educated Baron Bruno Schroder, a non-exec at Schroders who happens to be his brother-in-law. </p> <p>Another stalwart on the list of oldest directors is Sir Ken Morrison, who received \u00a3736,000 last year in his capacity as chairman of the supermarket group. The no-nonsense Yorkshireman who turned a market-stall business into a retail empire has now retired. </p> <p>Sir Brian Pitman, the 77-year-old former chief executive of Lloyds TSB, remains as active as ever in the City, picking up \u00a367,000 for his non-executive position on the board of Carphone Warehouse and a further \u00a358,000 at ITV.

  "<p>It was a familiar scene in a state along the drug-torn Mexico-Texas border -- a group of men lying face down with their hands tied behind their backs -- except these 35 men were wearing the dark blue pants and light blue shirts issued to the local police.</p> <p>Soldiers and federal agents captured the cops in Torreon, Coahuila, after a shootout this week in which 28 city patrol pickups were sent to free five Gulf cartel operatives just arrested by federal police, authorities said.</p> <p>On Thursday, the 35 police were charged with attempted murder and drug crimes and moved from jail to a state prison.</p> <p>And it was just one of several cases of high-profile police corruption or misconduct this week.</p> <p>On the opposite side of the country, where Mexico borders Guatemala, another big police bust this week netted 26 agents, including the Tabasco state police chief. They were allegedly on a payroll doled out to officers by the Zetas, a paramilitary group linked to the Gulf cartel.</p> <p>And in the beach resort of San Jose del Cabo, six officers are under house arrest for allegedly beating an American tourist to death at the local jail in August. </p> <p>Federal police and army soldiers are increasingly taking on local and state law enforcement groups that have sold out to drug traffickers and kidnappers, analysts say. And the criminal groups are rapidly spreading their influence far beyond the US-Mexico border, where police collusion with narcos has been legendary.</p> <p>The sudden airing of high-profile cases shows not just the familiar pattern of corrupt cops, but also the takeover of local and state law enforcement by the cartels and kidnappers, one security consultant said.</p> <p>\"What is new in terms of the narcos is that they have the money to buy off the local police force anytime they want to,\" said Jon French, head of the Mexico City firm Problem Solvers. \"You had corrupt police in the past, but not to this extent because you didn't have such a narco problem.\"</p> <p>With the 350,000 state and local police outnumbering their drug-fighting federal counterparts by nearly 20-to-1, President Felipe Calderon faces an uphill task to neutralise corrupt local forces, analysts said.</p> <p>But the corruption is not limited to poorly paid local and state police. A federal police commander was among those arrested in Tabasco, and Mexico City authorities implicated a female officer from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in a kidnapping ring that often killed its young victims.</p> <p>French said the record level of drug violence and busts of corrupt police has a counter-intuitive upside: Calderon's drug crackdown is fuelling the narco turf war and the internecine slayings among the cartels and their official protectors.</p> <p>Police involvement in the complex turf war among the Gulf, Sinaloa, Juarez and other cartels has also led to a record 450 police deaths this year, including 75 in August.</p> <p>\"I would be worried if there was no news at all on this front because that would mean the narcos were in control,\" said French, who gives security advice to US and Mexican business executives.</p> <p>But other security experts see it differently: the record 3,500 drug-related killings this year and the growing co-optation of local and state forces show that the government has lost control of wide swaths of Mexican territory.</p> <p>As drug traffickers' power grows through new businesses like kidnapping, protection rackets and even the distribution of pirated goods like music CDs and videos, so does their power to corrupt police, analysts said.</p> <p>\"The power of organised crime is growing and spreading to new territories,\" said Arturo Yanez, a former adviser to the federal government on security issues. \"With it, we see the weakening and the disintegration of law enforcement institutions.\"</p>",
  "<p>Even before Nasa finishes its study into the possibility of flying the space shuttle beyond its scheduled retirement in 2010, top agency officials have concluded that extending the life of the orbiter fleet won't solve the problem of keeping the international space station operable for US astronauts.</p> <p>Instead, Nasa officials have decided that they must convince Congress to allow the agency to buy Russian Soyuz spacecraft to serve as transport vehicles and lifeboats for US space farers and their international partners.</p> <p>Without the Soyuz, Nasa says in a congressional briefing paper obtained by the Orlando Sentinel, it will have to abandon the station when the current contract with Russia ends in October 2011 and cede control of the $100bn facility to Moscow.</p> <p>\"Continuing to fly the space shuttle past 2010 is not the answer to this situation,\" the paper says. \"The Soyuz option is simply the only sure solution ... or else the US has no choice but to de-crew all US astronauts (and de-facto the Canadian, European and Japanese astronauts) from the international space station in 2011.\"</p> <p>The paper is part of a last-ditch effort by the agency to overcome congressional resistance to waiving a law banning high-tech purchases from Russia because of Moscow's nuclear dealings with Iran.</p> <p>Administrator Mike Griffin has personally visited senior members of Congress this week, pleading for the waiver. Nasa says it needs the waiver this year to give Russia the three-year lead time needed to build more Soyuz after the current US supply runs out.</p> <p>Despite the dramatic appeal, the waiver is far from certain. Moscow's recent invasion of Georgia has chilled US-Russia relations.</p> <p>Congressional aides in both parties said the key concern is time. </p> <p>Congress plans to quite in three weeks to hit the campaign trail, which means Nasa must compete with other priorities, such as energy. And anti-Moscow sentiments run high.</p> <p>\"If any one senator objects, it's going to be hard to get it done in the next three weeks,\" said Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat from Florida, who said he's planning several legislative manoeuvres to get the waiver passed.</p> <p>\"We don't like the position that we're in, but we don't have any choice if we want to access our own space station,\" he said.</p> <p>The Nasa lobbying effort also appears to undermine a newly initiated study of what it would take to keep the shuttle flying past 2010. Last week, Griffin confirmed he expected such a request from the next presidential administration.</p> <p>Griffin privately had begun to question the wisdom of the 2010 deadline. In a confidential e-mail to his top advisers on August 18, he slammed the White House for what he called a \"jihad\" to shut down the shuttle and a desire to see the space station languish.</p> <p>In that e-mail, Griffin also rejected the idea, advanced by some in the administration, that the Russians would be unable to run the space station without the United States. \"We need them,\" he wrote. \"They don't need us.\"</p> <p>Griffin later said that the e-mail was taken out of context and that he supported the administration policy of retiring the shuttle in 2010 and relying on the Russians to keep US astronauts on the space station. </p> <p>According to administration officials, Griffin was called to the White House this week to discuss how to press ahead with White House policy and pursue the congressional waiver.</p>",
  "<p>Jacob Zuma today took a giant step towards South Africa's presidency after he was effectively cleared of corruption charges. He must now be considered the overwhelming favourite to succeed Thabo Mbeki as president in 2009 \u2013 having spent years winning over the millions of black South Africans who have gained little from post-apartheid rule.</p> <p>The 66-year-old will be delighted by the decision of judge Chris Nicholson, who ruled that government prosecutors were wrong to charge Zuma with corruption. The ANC leader will no doubt see it as yet another victory against a plot to keep him from office.</p> <p>Just how the enigmatic politician has continued to build his influence, despite numerous court appearances, has to be a cause for concern. At his trial for rape in 2006, of which he was acquitted, Zuma revealed beliefs that might not be expected to boost the career hopes of a would-be president.</p> <p>He told the court that his accuser, the 31-year-old daughter of a family friend, had led him to believe she wanted sex by complaining that she had no boyfriend, and by not crossing her legs while wearing a knee-length skirt.</p> <p>He saw little risk in unprotected sex with the HIV-positive Aids activist, the court heard, because he had showered afterwards. The nature of his defence did nothing to endear him to women's equality campaigners, nor those fighting the rampant spread of Aids in southern Africa - particularly as he is chairman of the country's Aids council. But it did little to dampen the enthusiasm of his supporters, who provided a jamboree atmosphere outside the Johannesburg courthouse during last year's trial, chanting \"Burn the bitch\" as his accuser arrived in court.</p> <p>Pandemonium erupted when the not-guilty verdict was announced. Ten men in leopard-skin skirts jumped on the benches, dancing and singing My President in his praise.</p> <p>Zuma was born in Inkandla, KwaZulu-Natal province, in 1942. After his father's death at the end of the second world war he accompanied his mother to Durban, where she became a domestic worker. He received no formal schooling. Influenced by a relative who was a fervent union member, he joined the African National Congress in 1959.</p> <p>Zuma rose in the ANC's military wing to become head of intelligence. Like Nelson Mandela, he was imprisoned on Robben Island for conspiring to overthrow white rule, spending 10 years in jail before going into exile.</p> <p>As an ethnic Zulu, his position in the ANC strikes a balance in an organisation perceived to be dominated by the Xhosa tribe of Mandela and Thabo Mbeki, who is now president.</p> <p>He retains a solid core of supporters, particularly among the least educated and unemployed.</p> <p>Zuma, who has two wives as is common in Zulu culture, was South Africa's deputy president for six years before being sacked in June 2005 over corruption allegations. His financial manager, Schabir Shaik, a friend from the anti-apartheid years, was convicted of fraud and corruption. The judge in the case said the two had a \"generally corrupt\" relationship.</p> <p>Zuma's support has traditionally come from his Zulu heartland, trade unions and left-leaning politicians who are increasingly unhappy with the free market macro-economic policies of Mbeki.</p> <p>His supporters, stoked by a belief that the court cases are politically motivated, are increasingly coming from a broader church, including young people and even the women's league of the ANC.</p> <p>In December last year, one of South Africa's most prominent businessmen, Tokyo Sexwale, a billionaire who until recently was also a candidate for the ANC leadership, threw his weight behind Zuma.</p> <p>The media limelight that Zuma has both enjoyed and endured has allowed him to set out his stall, demonstrating his common touch. He has shown a flair for dancing at political events, adopting an ANC anthem, the lyrics of which roughly translate as \"bring me my machine gun\".</p>",
  "<p>\"The Pope spoke at a synagogue in Berlin that was destroyed by the Nazis and apologized for the destruction. Then he politely wondered if, by any chance, during the rebuilding, anyone had found his wallet\".<br> That one was US comedian Bill Maher's. He got in hot water for it. But not as hot as Italian comic Sabina Guzzanti, who is now threatened with a five-year stretch in chokey for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/12/italy.catholicism?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=worldnews\">cracking jokes about ex-Cardinal Ratzinger</a>. In Italy, insulting the Pope \u2013 and indeed contempt for the president \u2013 is an offence punishable by one to five years in jail. Guzzanti's crime was to remark (with reference to the Catholic church's attitude to homosexuality) that \"in 20 years Ratzinger will be dead and will end up in hell, tormented by queer demons - not passive ones, but very active ones.\"<br> The nature of this wisecrack is ironic, given that another low-level furore about Pope jokes, back in 2006, related to rumours that Benedict XVI might himself be homosexual. Those cracks came at the expense of his good-looking right-hand man, Monsignor Georg Ganswein \u2013 pointedly called \"Gay-org\" by the Vatican gossip-mongers. As a Time magazine blogger wrote at the time, \"when you're a Pope who declares that even closeted, chaste gay men cannot be priests, it's pushing your luck to clothe yourself in Prada, bedeck your Pope-mobile with luxurious Natuzzi Italian white leather, and surround yourself with assistants who look like they strayed from the pages of L'Uomo Vogue.\" If it were up to Italian prosecutors, that blogger would be breaking rocks as we speak. To the rest of us, it isn't so much an offence to joke about the Pope (or about Silvio Berlusconi; or about, say, the Ayatollahs) as a moral imperative. Any powerful institution that decrees it must not be laughed at (as per the Vatican's 1929 treaty declaring the Pope \"sacred and inviolable\") should henceforward be exposed to relentless derision. That's how tyrannies are kept in check. Fortunately, most such institutions make it easy for us. Anti-Bush humour was verboten in the States for a while \u2013 remember all those schoolchildren expelled for wearing <a href=\"http://www.kidspeakonline.org/zachary.htm\">anti-Bush t-shirts</a>? \u2013 but there's only so long you can discuss Dubya with a straight face. Likewise the Pope. How can you not laugh at a Hitler Youth veteran in a frock <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5412166.stm\">earnestly redefining never-never-land</a>? Telling jokes about that isn't a crime, it's the only sane response.</p>",
  "<p>I can't speak for anyone else, but for me the Liberal Democrat conference next week is the most important one in years. The struggle within the party is much more nuanced than the media's left/right caricature would suggest \u2013 nonetheless I suspect that the strategic direction of the party will be set in motion one way or another this month.</p> <p>First of all there is the question of tax cuts, and related to that Nick Clegg's leadership style. I have to admit to still being <a href=\"http://www.theliberati.net/quaequamblog/2008/09/08/nick-clegg-dismisses-u-turn-on-tax-as-mere-details/\">absolutely livid</a> over the debacle this weekend which saw Clegg claiming that the \"<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/liberaldemocrats/2697033/Nick-Clegg-promises-larger-Lib-Dem-tax-cuts.html\">vast bulk</a>\" of any savings in government expenditure that the party ends up identifying will be ploughed into tax cuts to \"middle income earners\" only to go back to the more usual formula of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/the_westminster_hour/7603270.stm\">prioritising the party's alternative spending plans first</a> before looking to cut taxes for people on \"low and middle income earners\". Clegg's insistence that the difference between the two position is \"mere detail\" is simply unsustainable.</p> <p>As a party which is continually accused of promising the Earth on the basis that we won't ever have to deliver on our promises, the Lib Dems have had to be extraordinarily careful when discussing tax policy. We take great pains to ensure that our manifestos and tax policy papers are fully costed. All that is in danger of being undone. If things seemed <a href=\"http://www.libdemvoice.org/clegg-launches-make-it-happen-with-call-to-cut-taxes-3028.html#comment-56169\">vague</a> back in July when the party launched its pre-manifesto document, they are even worse now. Having created so much confusion, it is absolutely crucial that next week Clegg comes down firmly on one side or the other. And in doing so he mustn't be tempted to leave himself enough wriggle room to start his infamous habit of \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/21/ichbineinclegghead\">thinking aloud</a>\" in public again. Enough is enough.</p> <p>Another crucial test will be how conference responds to the proposals for a <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/policies/fast-track-britain-building-a-transport-system-for-the-21st-century-393842;show\">national road user charging scheme</a>. Even Labour has now gone cold on this idea, yet the Lib Dem parliamentary party appears dominated with people still enamoured of it. The scheme will be expensive to administer, force every motorist in the country to install a GPS transponder and crucially, will take 10 years to introduce. Yet it will not achieve a single environmental objective that petrol duty does more efficiently. Indeed, given that it will be as concerned with alleviating congestion as reducing carbon it could very likely lead to an increase in emissions.</p> <p>The Lib Dem conference is set to coincide with the start of former millionaire donor Michael Brown's fraud trial. While <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/07/liberaldemocrats.partyfunding\">Robert Mann's tear jerking account</a> of why Brown's ability to con him as well as the Charles Kennedy means that the party should give him \u00a3600k does not convince (caveat emptor?), the fact is this debacle has done the party incalculable harm in the eyes of the public.</p> <p>In the US, both presidential candidates are competing with each other on the basis of who is running the cleaner campaign. In the UK, parties have thus far played a game of blaming each other for not cleaning up their own acts. Clegg should use his speech next Wednesday to break this deadlock by unilaterally imposing <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Sky-News-Archive/Article/20082851308583\">his own policy</a> of an annual \u00a325,000 cap on donations from individuals and companies on the party's own coffers.</p> <p>Finally, along with my colleague <a href=\"http://www.libdemvoice.org/conference-policy-motion-giving-citizens-a-voice-in-parliament-3298.html\">David Boyle</a> I have a policy motion of my own at this conference. This motion seeks to commit the party to a package of measures to give the public a greater say in policy making. Significantly, the final say would remain with Parliament, but it does propose greater petitioning powers, the establishment of citizen-initiated bills and the right to \"call-in\" legislation and hold a referendum on it if a million people petition against it.</p> <p>In many ways the debate over this motion gets to the very soul of the party. We consistently call for more power to the people but have a disappointing track record of only saying this sotto voce, notably during the 2005 general election. This leads commentators such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/05/scotland.snp\">Simon Jenkins</a> to be very cynical about whether we genuinely believe in it.</p> <p>This motion is quite a modest measure (it doesn't come close to proposing the sort of full <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative\">initiative and referendum system</a> that they have in places such as Switzerland and California), yet it appears to be causing people consternation. The <a href=\"http://www.libdemvoice.org/diana-wallis-mep-writes-time-for-the-liberal-democrats-to-let-the-people-in-3615.html\">refrain</a> is that if you give citizens too much power, they will only use it to impose regressive measures and block progressive ones. The experience of such systems worldwide simply doesn't support that hypothesis, yet it remains a persistent concern.</p> <p>Are the Liberal Democrats <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicals_(UK)\">Radicals</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_(British_political_faction)\">Whigs</a>? Are we about empowering people or providing for them? These are the fundamental questions that go to the heart of the party. Over the next seven days, to at least some extent, these questions will be answered one way or another.</p>",

  "<p>By 1pm BST on Sunday afternoon, when Lewis Hamilton and Felipe Massa settle down to the next round of their championship battle, formula one fans will finally have something else to think about other than the controversy that marred the Belgian grand prix. If they're still watching the sport, that is.</p> <p>Having adjusted to the fact, over recent years, that formula one no longer made the headlines in Britain's national media, last year's prominence of the sport was a shock. We owed it, of course, to Hamilton's explosion of talent. And to the FIA for the monumental penalty levied against McLaren over the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/dec/14/motorsports.sport\">spying scandal</a>. And to Fernando Alonso's breakdown of relations with his team. And to Max Mosley's sexual predilections. Now, after one of the most eye-blinking, play-that-again on-track sparring matches of recent history, we take a step back and there's another reason for the sport to be analysed and debated - and for people to say they'll never watch a race again. </p> <p>Whether you feel the penalty levied against Hamilton was the cause of a hidden bias towards Ferrari, or whether you think that he gained an advantage and according to the letter of the law deserved to lose his victory, you will have an opinion on this incident. I've spent hours watching videos and trawling over blog posts since Sunday evening, at times heartened by the passion fans feel for the sport and at others disgusted by the xenophobia on display. </p> <p>For some it's a clear-cut case of discrimination and dark forces at work. Personally, I'm not so sure. After years of covering other championships and being lobbied by drivers against stewards' injustices, questioning many a judgment myself, I learned that we'll never be privy to all the evidence. In most circumstances, we owe it to the sport's 'police' to accept their analysis, and it's worth mentioning that most drivers were on the FIA's side. </p> <p>When it comes to the penalty applied, however, it's easy to be less forgiving. There was the choice between a drive-through converted to a 25-second penalty, or a 10-place grid drop at the next race. The former would have a dramatic influence on the drivers' championship standings for a misdemeanour that didn't alter the result of the race, the latter less so. In my view, and that of many others, they picked the wrong one.</p> <p>But as those of us who haven't walked away are still trying to calm down ahead of the last European race of the season, we should take our lead from the man at the centre of the brouhaha. Hamilton is displaying the same maturity in his outlook that he is in his racing. The confidence that allows him to dive past rivals in the wet (and it's been throwing it down at Monza, too) is the same confidence that sees him put the weekend behind him and focus on beating Massa in Ferrari's backyard. He says he doesn't want revenge, he says he's going to make \"damn sure\" his championship bid isn't influenced by the penalty and he knows that he's got thousands of supporters \u2013 including a few Italian ones \u2013 on his side.</p> <h2>British motor racing loses its Seat</h2> <p>Spanish manufacturer Seat's decision to pull out of the British Touring Car Championship and axe its one-make Cupra series \u2013 saying the marketing spend is to be invested elsewhere - is a blow to motor racing in Britain. Although the sport has an abundance of junior categories, the Cupra championship has been crucial to progressing the careers of drivers such as Mat Jackson (through prize money alone), and will leave a big hole. The BTCC itself needs names such as Jason Plato and Darren Turner to remain on its roster and could do with poaching some of the World Touring Car teams or drivers, who might make a bigger impact racing in their home country than on the world stage. </p> <p><strong>Last weekend's action</strong><br>Hamilton wasn't the only driver to be hit with a severe penalty at Spa Francorchamps, as the GP2 series leader Giorgio Pantano was disqualified from both races for hitting a fellow driver in race one. The move was certainly naughtier than Hamilton's, but it sets the championship up for a stunning finale in Pantano's home race at Monza this weekend. Bruno Senna also failed to score points in either race and still has a good chance of beating Pantano, so this weekend is set to be as thrilling as they get. </p> <p><strong>This weekend's action</strong><br>Another title to be decided this weekend is the Le Mans Series drivers' crown. Peugeot's two cars have taken four out of four wins so far, gaining revenge on Audi after their Le Mans 24 Hours disappointment. But the Audi pairing of Alex Premat and Mike Rockenfeller are just two points shy of Peugeot's lead team of Nicolas Minassian and Marc Gene, and could easily snatch that trophy from them at Silverstone. After years of Audi dominance, it's fantastic to see some intrigue in the world of prototypes even if home hero Allan McNish, in the second Audi, has no chance of claiming the spoils.</p>",
  "<p>Remember 1994? Blur's Girls &amp; Boys was at the top of the charts, a new sitcom called Friends started to air and I spent a lot of time in the college computer room emailing my then boyfriend, and getting wildly excited when we found we were emailing at the same time.</p> <p>We'd exchange emails, rapidly click \"check for mail\" and, with only five minutes to wait between messages it was almost like we were having a real conversation!<br> Times have changed, and now instant-messaging software is everywhere. Skype, Windows Live messenger, AOL Instant Messenger and Jabber have a combined total of almost 1 billion users.</p> <p>And that doesn't include the 783 million registered users of Tencent QQ, a messaging service most popular in China.</p> <p>Multi-protocol instant message programmes like <a href=\"http://www.adiumx.com/\">Adium</a> or <a href=\"http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/\">Trillian</a> have been created, to allow people with multiple accounts on different messaging systems to read their messages without keeping half a dozen separate programs running.</p> <p> Online games like World of Warcraft have their own instant chat systems, no internet dating site would be complete without one, and even Facebook has recently jumped on the bandwagon.<br> With all these opportunities for real-time chat, it's easier than ever to make friends online with people in different cities, different countries, and different timezones. But are instant messenger friendships 'real' friendships?</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/sep/11/facebook.myspace\">study last year suggested not</a>, saying that \"90% of contacts who the subjects regarded as close friends were people they had met face to face\".</p> <p>That's not very surprising. What interests me is that other 10%: people who had not met face-to-face but nonetheless considered each other close friends.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=15114)\">Another study</a> found that 75% of online role-playing gamers \u2013 a technophile group, admittedly \u2013 had made good friendships online.<br> This raises the question of what a \"real\" friendship is. My college boyfriend and I might have communicated by email, but we did spend plenty of time together IRL \u2013 \"in real life\". But among my geek friends \u2013 mostly younger than me \u2013 I'm practically unique in never having made friends with someone I met purely online. My instinct remains that real-life friendships must surely be more solid, more authentic, than purely online encounters. But my experience of instant messenger communication is slowly making me change my mind.</p> <p>My dear friend Andrea \u2013 who lives in New York \u2013 and I have probably spent a total of 24 hours in one another's physical company. But, after \"meeting\" online while working on a project together several years ago, we talk almost every day.</p> <p>In a way, this friendship seems purer than a real-life one: Andrea doesn't have to come over to my place to chat, and deal with my washing-up aversion, my bad-hair days, or the mess that accumulates when I'm working. We can share ideas, insights, complaints and triumphs throughout the day, becoming <a href=\"http://rooreynolds.com/2008/03/12/ambient-skype/\">quasi-ambient communicators</a> in a way that would probably drive me crazy if we were in the same room all the time.<br> This form of communication does change friendship, of course. In a way, it makes us more likely to take one another's side.</p> <p>If we were living closer together we'd probably by now have spent a lot of time not just with each other but also with each other's friends, partners and families. And, when we reported an argument or a falling-out, that more rounded view might make us less sympathetic.</p> <p>As it is, we are each other's only windows on our worlds; this doesn't make the friendship less 'real', but it does make it different.<br> I can't, of course, go round to Andrea's place to babysit her children. She can't bring me chicken soup when I'm ill. But the affectionate cheerleading of an online friendship are, nonetheless, pretty comforting.</p>",

  "<p>Residents in parts of Texas were today told to evacuate their homes or face \"certain death\" from flooding caused by the oncoming hurricane Ike.</p> <p>Forecasters issued the warning to people living in homes facing the Gulf of Mexico along a low-lying stretch of Galveston Island and the neighbouring Bolivar peninsula.<br> A wall of water being pushed onshore by the storm could cause floods of up to 7 metres (22ft) above sea level, enough to cover many houses on the island, according to the National Weather Service.</p> <p>\"Persons not heeding evacuation orders in single-family, one- or two-storey homes will face certain death,\" the service said in a local bulletin. \"Many residences of average construction directly on the coast will be destroyed.\"</p> <p>Almost a million people along the Texan coast have been ordered to evacuate their homes before the powerful hurricane strikes the heart of the US refining industry early tomorrow morning.</p> <p>The storm has already killed more than 70 people in the Caribbean, including 66 Haitians and four Cubans. It has also caused billions of pounds worth of damage across the region, with 80% of homes in the Turks and Caicos Islands said to be damaged. </p> <p>At 12 midday GMT today, Ike was about 230 miles (370km) south-east of Galveston, with winds above 100mph.</p> <p>The hurricane's predicted path will take it through Galveston and on to Houston, the fourth largest city in the US.</p> <p>But the authorities have ordered most people in Houston not to leave the city in an attempt to avoid total gridlock on the roads.</p> <p>The decision to order Houston residents to stay put is a stark contrast to how officials responded to hurricane Rita in 2005. Then city residents were told to leave while the population of Galveston Island was still clogging the roads. It proved to be a tragic decision: 110 people died during the evacuation while nine died in the category four storm that followed.</p> <p>Yesterday, as cars and trucks streamed inland, waves were already crashing over the beach on one end of Galveston Island, about 50 miles south-east of Houston.</p> <p>The hurricane is currently a category two storm but is expected to make landfall as a category three storm with winds of up to 130mph.</p> <p>Ken Reeves, forecast manager at AccuWeather.com, said: \"In contrast to the major hits in the Gulf over the past several years, including Katrina, Ike will not weaken significantly before landfall. As a result the damage potential is exponentially higher.\"</p> <p>Texas is home to the United States' biggest oil refinery and Nasa's Johnson Space Centre, which both lie in areas vulnerable to wind and floodwaters.</p> <p>Weather forecasters warned that Ike is so large that it could inflict a punishing blow even to those areas that escaped a direct hit.</p> <p>\"It's a big storm,\" the Texas governor, Rick Perry, said. \"I cannot overemphasise the danger that is facing us. It's going to do some substantial damage. It's going to knock out power. It's going to cause massive flooding.\"</p> <p>\"We're not talking about gently rising water,\" judge Ed Emmett, Harris county's chief administrator, said. \"We're talking about a surge that will come into your homes.\"</p> <p>Hurricane warnings were in effect over a 400-mile stretch of coastline from south of Corpus Christi to Morgan City, Louisiana. Tropical storm warnings extended south almost to the Mexican border and east to the Mississippi-Alabama line, including New Orleans.</p> <p>Most of the evacuations were limited to sections of Harris county outside Houston, as well as nearby Galveston Bay. But the 2 million residents of the city itself and 1 million in other areas of the county were asked to remain at home.</p> <p>\"We are still saying: please shelter in place, or to use the Texas expression, hunker down,\" said Emmett. \"For the vast majority of people who live in our area, stay where you are. The winds will blow and they'll howl and we'll get a lot of rain, but if you lose power and need to leave, you can do that later.\"</p> <p>Nasa closed the Johnson Space Centre, including mission control, and set up temporary headquarters near Austin and Huntsville, Alabama.</p> <p>Wholesale fuel prices rose 30% yesterday out of fear of the damage Ike could cause the refining industry. The upper Texas coast accounts for a fifth of US refining capacity.</p> <p>Ike would be the first major hurricane to hit a US metropolitan area since Katrina devastated New Orleans three years ago. For Houston, it would be the first major hurricane since Alicia in August 1983 came ashore on Galveston Island, killing 21 people and causing $2bn in damage.</p>",
  "<p>A South African judge today ruled that government prosecutors were wrong to charge Jacob Zuma, the head of the ruling African National Congress (ANC), with corruption.</p> <p>The controversial ruling effectively clears the way for the 66-year-old to succeed Thabo Mbeki as the country's president. </p> <p>Judge Chris Nicholson reserved strong criticism for prosecutors and political leaders, including Mbeki.</p> <p>His ruling said there was reason to believe the decision to charge Zuma had been politically motivated and that the party leader should have been consulted before the national prosecuting authority sought his conviction.</p> <p>As the head of the ruling ANC, Zuma, a former freedom fighter, is likely to run for president next year when Mbeki's second and final term ends. </p> <p>The party's political dominance all but assures its leader of victory in the presidential race. </p> <p>Following a two-hour-long reading of his ruling, the high court judge said that the decision to \"prosecute the applicant [was] \u2026 invalid and is set aside\". </p> <p>\"I'm not convinced that the applicant was incorrect in averring political meddling in his prosecution,\" he said, expressing concern that prosecutors were influenced by members of Mbeki's cabinet.</p> <p>He said it was \"improbable\" the ministers had acted without Mbeki's knowledge and agreement, adding that the episode seemed to have formed part of \"some great political contest or game\". </p> <p>Leading ANC officials and Zuma supporters in the packed courtroom broke into cheers in scenes broadcast on national television. The jubilant Zuma embraced his lawyer. </p> <p>Nicholson warned that his ruling did not touch on guilt or innocence, and said prosecutors could file charges again once they had met the requirement of consulting with Zuma. </p> <p>However, the national prosecuting authority will come under huge pressure not to file charges again. </p> <p>Parliament is pushing through legislation to scrap its elite investigating unit, the Scorpions, in response to ANC anger over what it sees as a persecution of Zuma. </p> <p>Even some business leaders have suggested that charges against Zuma should be dropped in the interests of future political stability in Africa's economic powerhouse. </p> <p>Tensions in South Africa have mounted over recent weeks, with Zuma supporters threatening to make the country ungovernable if his trial went ahead. </p> <p>Influential ANC Youth League leaders said they were prepared to kill and die for Zuma. </p> <p>He is hugely popular among poor South Africans who feel alienated by Mbeki's perceived intellectual aloofness and are tired of waiting for their living conditions to improve 14 years after the end of apartheid. </p> <p>Even though Mbeki is barred by the constitution from running again for the nation's presidency, he competed against Zuma for the party leadership, apparently trying to exercise control over who should succeed him. </p> <p>Mbeki's spokesman, Mukoni Ratshitanga, said he could not immediately comment on the Zuma judgment because of its length. </p> <p>\"One would have to look at the judgment before any comments are made, if comments are necessary,\" he added. </p> <p>Zuma was initially charged with corruption in 2005, but that case was dismissed on a technicality in 2006. </p> <p>He was charged again in December 2007 - days after being elected as the ANC president - with racketeering, corruption, money laundering and fraud related to a government arms deal in the late 1990s. </p> <p>Zuma \u2013 who was acquitted of rape in 2006 - has used his legal battles to burnish his populist reputation, portraying himself as a victim of a plot by the elite to keep the son of a maid out of the president's office.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Philadelphia.</p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Jayson Musson aka PackofRats, Michael Stern aka SQUID, Kurt Hunte aka No Body's Child (NBC), Jon Folmar aka Jon Thousand, Si Young Lee aka DJ Si Young, Naeem Juwan aka MC Spankrock aka \"The Freshman\".</p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> The late-80s/early-90s hip-hop revival, spearheaded by the Cool Kids and Kid Sister, continues apace with Plastic Little, who have performed alongside Mark Ronson and Jay-Z, done remixes for everyone from Hot Chip to Just Jack and are playing some US shows with Santogold this month. Named after a Japanese anime, their fun-size, comical raps, between-song skits, facetiously deployed samples from the most unlikely sources (A Whole New World from the 1992 Disney movie Aladdin, anyone?) and party jams recall the surreal-hop heyday of Digital Underground, the Pharcyde et al (they even reference Jurassic 5 on one of their tracks). They're based in Philly where two of their members used to be in a more politically motivated outfit called Pro-Toulouse. PL's comedy quotient is higher, but there is a sort of seriousness of intent here, or a message beneath the mirth, a suggestion confirmed by the discovery that frontman Musson moonlights as a <a href=\"http://www.freenewsprojects.blogspot.com\">serial blogger</a>, not to mention satirical artist: see <a href=\"http://www.jaysonmusson.com\">www.jaysonmusson.com</a>, where you will learn that \"Jayson Scott Musson has shown his artwork in many places throughout the bright land of America, to the critical acclaim of many bohemians and alcoholics from coast to coast\".</p> <p>So much for their extracurricular activities \u2013 what about the music? The first thing you will hear from Plastic Little will be Cheap Thrills, a collaboration with British DJ/producer Herve based on a chunky sample/sampled chunk of Michael Jackson's Thriller \u2013 their songs are full of references to other musicians and assorted pop-cultural detritus. Cheap Thrills features a crisp 4/4 beat and a soulful female vocal from someone called Lady Ni that makes the whole thing sound like Keisha Buchanan being bounced around by Quincy Jones and Daft Punk with rude interjections from our Philly-rap heroes.</p> <p>Their songs are colourful, vivid and visual, but if the lyrics don't quite spell this out, try one of their videos. The one for their track <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKJb4iZ3eoQ\">The Dopeness</a> is great, albeit ghoulish, especially the bit where the men in the band give birth to themselves. Not for the squeamish, although the Choose Life brigade will be delighted.</p> <p>For Plastic Little, who are apparently on \"an epic quest to get laid\", being risqu\u00e9 is their shtick. Drizhollering contains references to fisting (and Fischerspooner). The a cappella opening to Brooklyn goes, \"Oh Brooklyn, if you were a girl I'd eat you out, and for five days I wouldn't wash my mouth\" while the intro to Cum Quick is as subtle as its title suggests. Then they don't so much step over the line as pull their pants down and defecate on it. \"Why date her, if I can rape her?\" they ask on Hola Plastique, nabbing a few couplets from the Smiths' Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now as they go. They're potty-mouthed miserabilists: Get Close is performed over the Cure's Close to Me. We're not sure what they're trying to achieve with these shock tactics and stun samples, but it's entertaining as hell.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"The purest, most unaffected fun available in hip-hop right now.\"</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> They're gonna part-ayy like it's 1989.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Feature Sarah Palin as a lipstick pitbull in their next video.</p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> Soundtrack the next Disney movie.</p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> Debut album Welcome to the Jang House is released by Half Time on September 29, the same day as the Herve single Cheap Thrills, released on Ministry Of Sound.</p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> Digital Underground, the Pharcyde, Jurassic 5, De La Soul.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/plasticlittlerap\">www.myspace.com/plasticlittlerap</a></p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> The Asteroids Galaxy Tour.</p>",
  "<p>Holidaymakers may have been in the dark about the imminent collapse of XL Leisure, but to City punters it was an odds-on bet - a near certainty. </p> <p>Bookmaker Paddy Power had taken so many wagers on the company going bust that by 7pm yesterday it was forced to close the book. It had been taking bets on which airline would be next to fail - XL was not even on the original list but was added at punters' requests, at a starting price of 10-1. Even when the odds came down to 4/6, gamblers were still putting hundreds of pounds on the company's likely collapse. </p> <p>A spokesman for the betting firm said today that it would be paying out a total of \u00a310,000 to punters. The largest single wager on XL was \u00a3500 at 4-1, which paid out \u00a32,000.</p> <p>The rising price of fuel has led to persistent rumours about the health of the airline industry. But the specific focus on XL could have been sparked by a little-noticed announcement to the Icelandic stock exchange on Wednesday.</p> <p>The announcement was made by Icelandic transport group Eimskipafelag Islands - known as Eimskip - and referred to a loan it had made when it sold XL Leisure to a management buyout in 2006. Eimskip had made a loan guarantee of \u20ac207m (\u00a3165m) to the buyers of the airline and was concerned that the \"conditions in the aviation market and information of the operation of XL\" would make it more likely that it had to honour the guarantee. </p> <p>To protect itself, Eimskip had lined up a group of \"significant investors\" - led by local multimillionaire businessmen and father and son duo Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson and Bjorgolfur Thor Bjorgolfsson to takeover the loan.</p> <p>The decision by the pair to step in is no coincidence. They are both investors in Eimskip.</p> <p>The older of the pair - Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson - is known to West Ham fans as the owner of the club since he bought a stake owned by another Icelander Eggert Magnusson. XL also sponsors the club's kit. He is better known in the business community as the chairman of Landsbanki, the Icelandic bank which backed the buyout of XL two years ago. With his son, he controls 40% of the bank which no longer has any direct exposure to XL.</p> <p>Another of their banking ventures does, however. The pair also control Straumur-Burdaras, the bank which has admitted it is owed \u20ac45m by XL. Conceding that the amount is \"not insignificant\", the bank stressed it was small in the context of Straumur's capital base of \u20ac1.5bn. The younger of the two, Bjorgolfur Thor Bjorgolfsson, is chairman of Staumur and in fact richer and more powerful locally than his father.</p> <p>Such inter-relationships are commonplace in Icelandic business, a small community that has sought investments overseas as its local opportunities have run out.</p> <p>Further links can be found. The brains behind XL Leisure is Magnus Thorsteinsson who until December was the chairman of Eimskip, the company which sold XL in 2006. He is also a close business associate of Bjorgolfur Thor Bjorgolfsson with whom he set up a brewery in Russia which was later sold to Heineken. Eimskip used to be known as Avion Group. </p> <p>It was from the money that was made in Russia that they were able to buy Landsbanki, which marked a return to Icelandic banking circles by Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson. In 1991 he had been sentenced to 12-months' imprisonment, suspended for two years, for his part in the Hafskip shipping collapse. </p>",
  "<p>Early starts? So last year. Eating at your desk? Overrated. Going to an office? Waste of time. Work as we know it (or WAWKI, obviously) will never be the same again. I know this might seem a grand claim for a Friday, but bear with me. You see, a few years ago the CBI released shocking research suggesting - nay, stating - that <a href=\"http://www.personneltoday.com/articles/2005/09/12/31537/cbi-highlights-downside-of-flexible-working.html\">flexible working was a Bad Thing</a>. </p> <p>Deputy director general, John Cridland, was even reported as saying the survey provided \"a disturbing insight\" into the impact of new employment legislation and that \"unjustified employment law, just to placate the trade union movement, must be resisted\". So far, so WAWKI.</p> <p>Fast forward to 2008 - last Monday, to be precise - and what do we find? Only that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2008/sep/08/worklifebalance.economicgrowth\">the CBI has gone and changed its mind</a>. \"Employers are embracing flexible working even as the economy heads into more uncertain times,\" Cridland now says. \"Teleworking is a useful way to avoid a laborious commute, balance family commitments and even reduce carbon emissions\". Balance?! Family commitments?! Lordy, it's just not WAWKI.</p> <p>What should we conclude from this alarming about-turn, on view thanks to the marvellous power of internet archiving? One, employers will squeeze every last drop of productive energy from employees. Cooping us up in offices and not ever letting us out, or letting us roam free with a CrackBerry ensuring we remain virtually tethered to the desk - it's all the same to the Man. Two, whatever employers do to us, we'll still resent them. </p> <p>Really, though, I should be grateful to be in a job. Disturbing analysis from the Social Market Foundation suggests government plans to use private contractors to tackle long-term unemployment could unintentionally result in the most vulnerable jobseekers being <a href=\"http://uk.news.yahoo.com/epolitix/20080908/tpl-welfare-reforms-have-flaws-0a1c1a1.html\">\"parked\"</a>. </p> <p>And, sadly, things are not much more cheery at the other end of the labour market. Cranfield School of Management has found that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/sep/07/banking.women \">just 5% of bank managing directors are female</a> (compared to the still pitiful 11% of FTSE directors and 19% of MPs). Those who have got to the top may have made big sacrifices - almost half of the women in a senior position in investment banking have no children. </p> <p>So thank goodness for the rousing words of Herta von Stiegel, a senior banker who has worked for JP Morgan, Citibank and AIG. \"I have led some of the most complex deals in corporate finance, and I can tell you there is no need to push 24/7. If you are organised, you can structure yourself better,\" she says. </p> <p>\"We do not want the same treatment as men; we want to cater for people's diversity. In my view, that takes enlightened men and brave women\". It almost makes you want to jack in the day job to become a banker - an outcome I can only describe as definitely not WAWKI.</p>",

  "<p>Only news of a Freebie and the Bean remake directed by Terrence Malick could have astonished me more. David Gordon Green, who secured my swooning admiration for his serenely beautiful first feature George Washington in 2000, and a basic level of fandom ever since for his high arthouse cine-Americana, has taken the directorial reins, or maybe just taken the cheque, for a stoner comedy thriller produced by Judd Apatow. Seth Rogen and James Franco play two dopeheads on the run from serious bad guys. Really, it could have been directed by anyone, although one gentle mini-montage of Rogen and Franco clowning around in a forest at dawn does look a bit like what I must now think of as the Master's early work. Watching this without having got stoned first is like watching a 3D movie without the special glasses. There are a few moderate laughs (and a nice Jude Law gag) but the full-on gory violence is disconcerting and unfunny.</p>",
  "<p>A <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1019877.html\">disturbing report</a> published this week highlights yet another facet of Israel's regime in the occupied territories that is seeing Palestinian lives ruined and families torn apart. As if the alienation of the Palestinians from their pre-1948 homelands wasn't crushing enough to those affected, the <a href=\"http://www.hamoked.org/\">Hamoked-B'Tselem</a> study reveals an alarming increase in forcible transfers of West Bank residents to the Gaza Strip, effectively making refugees twice over of those falling victim to this punitive policy. </p> <p>Palestinians whose registered address is in Gaza are now prohibited from living in the West Bank, regardless of how long ago they made the move eastwards. Thanks to Israel's flouting of the <a href=\"http://www.palestinefacts.org/pf_1991to_now_oslo_accords.php\">Oslo agreements</a>, the process of updating Palestinians' addresses on the population registry has been indefinitely frozen, making criminals of everyone who falls foul of the rule. The effect has been to separate husbands from their wives and parents from their children, and to add yet another layer of hardship to the already gruelling circumstances in which the Palestinians live. </p> <p>According to the authors of the paper, the reason behind the Israel authorities' recent escalation of enforcing this law is based on a desire to do everything within their power to drive a wedge between the West Bank and Gaza, and to turn them into separate entities. This is, again, in direct contravention of the Oslo Accords, which state that the two areas are to be treated as one geographical unit; but at the same time it is entirely in keeping with Israel's strategy of cutting off Gaza as a way of punishing the Hamas government. </p> <p>B'Tselem's Jessica Montell, who presented the findings at a press conference on Wednesday, pointed out that Israel is not acting alone when attempting to isolate and demonise Hamas: \"The United States and Europe worked closely with Israel to form a united position towards the Hamas government, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/23/israelandthepalestinians.world\">siege on Gaza</a> [which] stemmed from that\". Montell described the latest moves to clamp down on so-called \"illegal aliens\" in the West Bank as an \"exacerbation\" of this ostracising approach towards the Hamas leadership. </p> <p>However, as was shown by way of written and video testimony from Palestinians affected by Israel's increasingly heavy-handed tactics, it is ordinary civilians who are suffering the most. Hadeel al-Bardawil, a 22-year-old mother of two, has been forcibly separated from her husband for over a year, during which time their second child (whom her husband Jamal has never seen) was born. Neither she nor her husband can convince the Israeli authorities to grant them permits to visit one another in either the West Bank or Gaza, and the impact on the entire family has been immense. </p> <p>\"My children now run to their uncles and call them 'daddy'\", she said. \"I want them to be with their father like other children; all that I ask for is to live my life in dignity with my family\". </p> <p>Her story is by no means unique. Another man described his plight as \"abnormal \u2013 I haven't seen my daughter for over a year\". When asked by the interviewer whether he had phone contact with her, he replied bitterly \"We're sick of the phone; everyone always cries\". Dozens of similar cases have been brought to the attention of Hamoked although, according to Montell, the number of people affected by the policy could run into \"many thousands\". </p> <p>On top of the denial of permits for families to be reunited, there has been a spate of forcible transfers of Gaza-registered civilians out of the West Bank and into the Gaza Strip, by way of house-to-house searches and other methods of tracking down so-called \"illegals\". </p> <p>Article 49 of the <a href=\"http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/genevaconventions\">Geneva conventions</a> expressly forbids occupying powers from \"forcible transfers, as well as deportation of protected persons [to anywhere else]\u2026 regardless of the motive\". <a href=\"http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGMDE150012004?open&amp;of=ENG-ISR\">Amnesty International</a> go further in their condemnation of the practice, stating that forcible transfer also violates article 33 of the Geneva conventions, which prohibits collective punishment. However, Israel's penchant for ignoring the statutes of international law is nothing new; the current policy being only the latest in a long line of contraventions, and those enforcing it are unlikely to be swayed by censure from human rights groups and NGOs. </p> <p>Instead, pressure should be brought to bear by those who, at present, are bankrolling and rubberstamping Israel's ever-more exacting regime in the occupied territories. Governments that declare themselves champions of human rights and staunch defenders of victims of abuse are, in effect, giving Israel carte blanche to proceed at will in their denial of basic freedoms to the Palestinians. </p> <p>As one desperate Palestinian mother put it during her testimony, \"[Why don't they just] put me in a cage? At least I'll know I'm in prison, and that I've got a problem; and then I'll give up. Where [else] in the world does a wife have to live apart from her husband for no reason?\" Her life in limbo is a constant nightmare, and every government cosying up to Israel, while it attempts permanently to divide the West Bank and Gaza, is just as responsible for her plight as the Israeli authorities themselves.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337537175\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>The historic power-sharing deal agreed in Zimbabwe gives the Movement for Democratic Change control over the cabinet and the police force that has terrorised its supporters and activists for years, opposition officials said today.</p> <p>But the president, Robert Mugabe, is to retain control of the military under the deal, which is due to be signed on Monday when full details will be revealed, according to the officials.</p> <p>The deal is expected to result in a de facto amnesty for the military and Zanu-PF party leaders responsible for their bloody campaign against opposition supporters and activists. Their attempt to overturn the opposition's election victory in March left hundreds dead and thousands badly injured.</p> <p>The deadlock in talks mediated by the South African president, Thabo Mbeki, was broken when the MDC leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, proposed a new council of state made up of Mugabe, two of his Zanu-PF deputies, Tsvangirai and two of his deputies, according to two opposition officials.</p> <p>Tsvangirai, 56, will be in charge of the cabinet and the 84-year-old Mugabe will be in charge of the council, which will act as an overseer of the cabinet's activities. But Mugabe will have no veto powers on the council.</p> <p>The MDC officials told the Associated Press that some members of their party were unhappy with the compromises. Tsvangirai had been demanding that Mugabe, Zimbabwe's leader since independence 28 years ago, become solely a ceremonial president after losing the last credible election six months ago.</p> <p>Mugabe has made no statement on the deal, but addressing traditional chiefs before talks resumed on Thursday, he had insisted: \"We will never allow the MDC to govern this country.\"</p> <p>Opposition officials said the deal gives the MDC 16 seats in the cabinet to Zanu-PF's 15. Tsvangirai's party will get eight deputy ministries, Mugabe's six, and one will go to a breakaway opposition faction led by Arthur Mutambara.</p> <p>One official said the deal included disbanding Zimbabwe's feared central intelligence organisation, which like the police falls within the remit of the ministry of home affairs, and replacing it with a smaller national security authority.</p> <p>Mbeki, who has staked his dwindling political reputation on brokering a deal, said: \"I am absolutely certain that the leadership of Zimbabwe is committed to implementing these agreements.\"</p> <p>British reaction was muted last night, with the government waiting to see the detail. \"We are following the situation closely,\" said a Foreign Office spokesman. \"We look forward to seeing the detail of the agreement announced by President Mbeki this evening. Our overriding concern is the welfare of the Zimbabwean people.\"</p> <p>If the agreement results in a real shift in power, it is likely to unlock the hundreds of millions of pounds in foreign aid desperately needed to shore up Zimbabwe's economy, which is collapsing under the weight of hyperinflation that has been a key factor in Mugabe conceding authority.</p> <p>Tsvangirai's party won the most votes in legislative and presidential elections in March, but according to election officials he did not win enough to avoid a run-off against Mugabe. Tsvangirai dropped out of the June ballot after his supporters were subjected to a state-sponsored campaign of intimidation and violence. Mugabe refused to remove the MDC leader's name from the election papers and claimed a crushing victory.</p>",
  "<p>Women of a certain age will be replacing their wardrobes and Geordie football fans will be crying into their Newcastle Brown Ale. Scientists have discovered that the fashion mantra that wearing vertical stripes makes you look thinner is not true. In fact, horizontal stripes are more flattering to those with a less than perfect physique.</p> <p>The accepted wisdom from fashion gurus is that an outfit with vertical stripes appears to elongate your figure by drawing the eye up and down. Horizontal stripes supposedly do the opposite, making that unruly paunch look even larger than it actually is.</p> <p>But when Dr Peter Thompson, a psychologist and expert in visual perception at the University of York, tested the optical illusion he found the opposite was true. \"Horizontal stripes don't make you look fatter,\" he said.</p> <p>His test involved showing pairs of pictures of women to volunteers. In each pair, one woman was wearing a dress with vertical stripes and the other was wearing horizontal stripes. In each pair the vertically striped figure was the same woman, but the horizontally striped figure was either slightly fatter or thinner. The subjects had to choose which they thought looked more rotund.</p> <p>By analysing the choices made by around 20 subjects he found that the vertically striped figure had to be 6% slimmer for them to judge the two women to be the same size. When both images in the pair were of identically sized women, people tended to judge the horizontally striped woman to be slimmer \u2013 contrary to received wisdom.</p> <p>Thompson, who presented his work at the British Association Festival of Science, said the effect is a version of the Helmholtz illusion, an optical effect in which a square with horizontal stripes appears taller and thinner compared with an identically sized one with vertical stripes.</p> <p>The man who discovered the illusion, the 19th century German physicist and physician Hermann von Helmholtz, gave out different fashion tips. \"Helmholtz actually said that women wear horizontal stripes to make themselves look taller so in the 19th century wearing horizontal stripes had a completely different belief attached to it than it does now,\" said Thompson.</p> <p>Another fashion tip for those who want to appear more lithe appears to be reliable, though. According to Thompson, wearing a black dress is a good strategy for hiding those excess pounds because of a separate optical illusion. </p> <p>\"Wearing black is a good thing,\" he said, \"That one works because we know that a black circle on a white background looks smaller than a white circle on a black background.\"</p> <p>However, Thompson's study of optical illusions casts doubt on another piece of popular wisdom. He believes that the standard advice from estate agents to show off your house with clear, uncluttered rooms is wrong. Filling up rooms with furniture should make them appear slightly bigger than they actually are, he said. Patterned wallpaper has the same effect.</p>",
  "<p>What's black and white and full of students? The punchline is ... our database. Funny or not, a campaign by TV Licensing to remind the inhabitants of the 317,000 student rooms on university campuses that they too have to pay the licence fee seems to have been effective. From 2003 TV Licensing (the trade name of the companies contracted to the BBC to collect the charge from owners of sets) used mail shots, online advertisements, trails on the BBC and posters. Their student campaign may help explain an increase in licences of 8% in the first year it ran and 24% in the subsequent year; two years on, 94% of a sample of students recalled the campaign. </p> <p>Each year the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising (IPA) publishes a study called Advertising Works! The exclamation mark recalls the old adman's adage that half of all advertising budgets are wasted, but nobody knows which half. Creative people tend to exaggerate their impact on the world and advertising, a multibillion industry that conventional economics can't quite explain or justify, is no exception. Yet a body of evidence does exist correlating media campaigns and, say, changes in market share or consumption of certain brands \u2013 they are convincing enough for Marks &amp; Spencer, the Halifax and other well-known companies to spend hugely. </p> <p><strong>Changes in public behaviour</strong><br>The IPA also has a large bank of studies of campaigns carried out on behalf of Whitehall departments and here too there are striking associations between the cost of campaigns and certain changes in public behaviour. Their studies have been mined for a new book*, published with the support of the Central Office of Information (COI). </p> <p>In a foreword, Sir Gus O'Donnell, the cabinet secretary, calls it groundbreaking and for once that large adjective is spot on \u2013 though you are left wondering why no one before has tried to evaluate just what central government gets for an advertising spend that comes behind only the soap giants Procter and Gamble and Unilever. (No one knows how much the state, including councils and peripheral bodies, spends in total.) </p> <p>The book lists campaigns to encourage people to pay their taxes on time, to become teachers and Northern Ireland police officers, to lock up their cars, to join the army, and \u2013 this one targeted on younger men \u2013 not to drink and drive. The signs of their effectiveness are there for all to see. </p> <p><strong>Desired effect </strong><br>Yet Peter Buchanan, the deputy chief executive of the COI, who masterminded the project, makes no heroic claims on behalf of government advertising, welcome though the evidence of its effects is. Himself an adman by background \u2013 he worked on the Nestle, BP and Procter &amp; Gamble accounts while at Saatchi and Saatchi \u2013 he notes that commercial advertising works by getting people to try a new brand or switch from one brand to another. Giving up smoking or joining the armed forces are by contrast \"life changing\" events \u2013 death defying in one case, you might say, and life threatening in the other. </p> <p>You are necessarily dealing here with a different order of message and desired effect. Impact is usually measured first through people's recall of the campaign and then whether they say their behaviour has changed. Ultimately, real changes in behaviour ought to be measurable by road accident statistics or, say, a declining cancer death rate. \"Government advertising,\" says Buchanan, \"is most effective where it goes with the grain of society.\" </p> <p>The book offers case studies and a toolkit rather models. Sometimes shock tactics work \u2013 such as the original Aids awareness advertising 20 years ago. Sometimes, advertising works best if it seems to be offering helpful facts, proffered in a low-key way. </p> <p>\"Over the years, I don't think government's capacity to influence behaviour has been reduced.\" But Buchanan, who began his own career back in the mists of time working for British Leyland cars, notes the rules of the road for his colleagues \u2013 to ensure their knowledge of people's thinking and doing is up to date, to \"understand where the target audience is\". </p> <p>A government advertising campaign rarely works alone. From 1998 successive campaigns sought to persuade younger graduates to teach, but increases in teacher pay and warm words from ministers about the profession helped. In the book it's claimed the advertising campaign paid for itself 86 times over \u2013 but that's based on a complex and hypothetical valuation to do with the cost of paying supply teachers for all the slots actually occupied by the additional teachers recruited, minus those who fell by the wayside before their training and probation was up (a surprising third). </p> <p><strong>Quality of public services</strong><br>Rebecca Morgan and John Poorta of the agencies Lowe Worldwide and Leo Burnett say \"the fact is that advertising has proved a truly efficient form of government investment\", arguing that as well as financial savings, campaigns have saved lives and improved the quality of public services by retaining and recruiting staff. And yet pinning down precise causes is hard. These two admit that money spent nationally on advertising smoke alarms could have been given to local fire and rescue services. </p> <p>They say: \"it is clear the campaign was a focusing agent, to get the issue on the agenda of house dwellers nationally so that when local fire brigades [undertook] their own local fire alarm drives, people were more predisposed to listen.\" Buchanan emphasises knowing the audience \u2013 remembering, for example, that some 30% of the population, often those the state wants most to reach, are not online or regular users of the web. </p> <p>On the other hand young people, another regular target group for messages, are often sophisticated in their use of media. The COI itself, when giving advice to departments, is media neutral. What Buchanan wants them to do, more than anything, is think hard before they write the briefs that the COI will use in negotiating with advertising agencies: planning and research in advance are critical, both for ministers and policy civil servants. \"Lack of time is the great enemy\" to campaign effectiveness, he concludes. </p> <p>* How public service advertising works, <a href=\"http://www.warc.com\">World Advertising <br>Research Center</a>, \u00a332 </p> <p>This article appears in this month's edition of the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public\">Public</a> magazine</p>",
  "<p>Anyone in Downing Street hoping to curry favour with Gordon Brown could do a lot worse than slip into his red box a copy of Peter Kellner's essay in the forthcoming Fabian Review. Kellner has managed to come up with six reasons why Labour could win the next election.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/columnists/maguire/2008/09/10/yougov-polling-guru-peter-kellner-reckons-could-win-next-general-election-115875-20730722/\">Kevin Maguire</a> mentioned it in the Daily Mirror a couple of days ago, but the full article is now available on the <a href=\"http://fabians.org.uk/general-news/general-news/kellner-reasons-cheerful\">Fabian Society website</a>, and it's worth a read. </p> <p>To summarise, here are Kellner's six points:</p> <p><strong>1.</strong> There's an inherent bias in the electoral system in favour of Labour. The Tories need a 6% lead just to get the same number of seats.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Governments normally lose popularity midterm and stage some kind of recovery as the election approaches.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Labour is not doing as badly as the Tories were in the mid-90s.</p> <p><strong>4. </strong>Labour is unpopular not because of a mistake like joining the ERM, but because of the state of the world economy. If the situation recovers, Brown could persuade people that he has steered Britain through a period of turbulence.</p> <p><strong>5. </strong>Cameron, though popular, is seen as shallow.</p> <p><strong>6. </strong>The Conservative party is still a tainted brand.</p> <p>Kellner is president of YouGov. During the London mayoral election, when other pollsters were describing Boris Johnson and Ken Livingstone as neck and neck, YouGov and Kellner were criticised for reporting that Livingstone was well behind. They turned out to be spot on.</p> <p>But is Kellner right this time? For what they're worth, here are some quick observations.</p> <p><strong>1.</strong> True <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/mar/11/unfairvotingsystem\">(as we've reported before)</a>, although the Tory lead is currently much bigger than six points.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> True, but to recover and win an election when you're as far behind as Labour is now would be unprecedented.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Debatable. Kellner says that the Labour vote only fell by around 40% in Crewe &amp; Nantwich and Glasgow East, whereas, in 1994, when the Tories lost Dudley West, their vote fell by 80%. Mike Smithson at Politicalbetting.com argues that Kellner is ignoring the significance of the <a href=\"http://politicalbetting.com/index.php/archives/2008/09/10/is-crewe-the-answer-to-maguire-and-kellner/\">relatively high turnouts in the 2008 byelections</a>. He has a neat theory about the <a href=\"http://politicalbetting.com/index.php/archives/2008/09/12/are-we-seeing-the-ending-of-the-tory-voters-strike/\">Tory voting strike</a> coming to an end.</p> <p><strong>.4</strong> Two things to say. I haven't yet read a really authoritative explanation as to why Labour's poll figures have collapsed so dramatically in the last 12 months, but I don't think the economy is the only explanation. The 10p debacle \u2013 ie taking money from five million poor people \u2013 must have had something to do with it. That may have been Brown's ERM.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/peter_riddell/article4727386.ece\">And Peter Riddell reported in the Times yesterday</a> some poll findings suggesting that the voters won't give Brown any credit if things get better. </p> <blockquote> <p>Populus asked voters if they agreed that \"if the economic situation improves dramatically over the next year or two, Labour will have a good chance of winning the next election\". Only 31% agreed, including 63% of Labour voters. But 67% of all voters, including 36% of Labour ones, agreed that \"even if the economic situation improves dramatically over the next year or two, there are many other reasons why it is time for a change\".</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>5. </strong>True, but voters said much the same about Tony Blair before 1997.</p> <p><strong>6.</strong> True, but YouGov's own figures, which you can find <a href=\"http://www.yougov.com/extranets/ygarchives/content/archivesPolitical.asp?rID=2\">here</a>, show that the Tories as a party are ahead of Labour on issues like education, taxation, law and order, asylum.</p> <p>What do you think?</p>",

I personally don't believe that's the case.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.caa.co.uk/\">CAA</a> is working with other airlines and tour operators to organise repatriation flights for package holiday travellers stranded abroad.</p> <p>It reckons there are 50,000 tour operator customers of XL already on holiday abroad, a further 10,000 overseas who had booked with XL Airways, and 25,000 with other tour operators who shared the XL flights.</p> <p>Wyatt reckons there are fewer stranded passengers than the CAA estimates but that the organisation faces a massive challenge in getting them back home.</p> <p>\"The CAA, believe me, will have a huge challenge on their hands to re-protect 67,000 people that are overseas now - 67,000 people who could have flown back on XL Airways, that are going to come back on God-knows-what carriers that the CAA find.\"</p> <p>\"It's going to be the most challenging airlift, I believe, that anyone has undertaken.\" </p> <p>Other airlines have already scrambled to help the CAA. BMI was one of the first off the ground with an Airbus A320 sent out of Heathrow at 6.30am to bring stranded passengers back from Minorca.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/ryanair\">Ryanair</a> is giving a fully staffed plane to the effort and will bring customers back for free. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/easyjet\">Easyjet</a> is charging a flat rate of \u00a375 - with one check-in bag - for XL customers stranded at overseas airports. The deal is open for the next seven days to any XL passenger who is not covered by ATOL protection.</p> <p>XL, which has a three-year sponsorship deal with football club West Ham that is worth \u00a32.5m annually and is only in its first season, ran flights to more than 50 destinations across Europe and Africa and sells through tour operator brands including The Really Great Holiday Company and Aspire Holidays.</p> <p><strong>Consumer protection<br></strong><br>Anyone who booked an inclusive holiday with XL or a charter flight through four of XL's numerous brands - The Really Great Holiday Company, Kosmar Villa Holidays, Freedom Flights or Aspire Holidays - will be covered by <a href=\"http://www.atol.org.uk/\">ATOL</a>'s financial protection scheme.</p> <p>But anyone who booked direct with XL Airways - whose flight numbers begin XLA - will have to either buy their way on to the CAA's specially organised flights or make their own way home.</p> <p>Package holidaymakers who booked with XL's Medlife business are also not covered by ATOL and anyone already abroad will not automatically be brought home.</p> <p>Other airlines are already reporting a massive increase in demand for flights as customers of XL, based in Crawley, West Sussex, try desperately to make alternative arrangements. The cost of a flight from Glasgow to Tenerife, for instance, has more than doubled to between \u00a3500 and \u00a3800. Prices for flights this evening have risen as high as \u00a31,800.</p> <p>The websites of both ATOL and the CAA, meanwhile, crashed this morning under the sheer weight of demand from worried XL customers. The helplines organised by the CAA, meanwhile, appeared permanently engaged.</p> <p>Anyone who booked their flights or a Medlife holiday with any credit card or a Visa debit card will be able to reclaim their money from their card issuer.</p> <p>Many passengers may also be covered by their travel insurance.</p> <p>Transport secretary Ruth Kelly said: \"The CAA have a wealth of experience in dealing with these sorts of situations and are putting systems in place to get people home, while the government stands ready to provide the CAA with operational assistance should they need it.\"</p> <p>The CAA has recommended that anyone expecting to travel with XL should not travel to the airport. But the first indication that anything was wrong for many holidaymakers came as they reached the check-in desks this morning only to discover that their flight had been cancelled. </p> <p>The company is the 26th travel firm to go bust in less than a year, forced under by the twin pressures of rising fuel costs and tough financial markets. Earlier this week <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/sep/11/theairlineindustry.spain\">Seguro Travel, which offered package deals to Gran Canaria and Costa Brava from Glasgow Prestwick airport, ceased trading</a> after the Spanish airline which operated 80% of its flights - Futura - launched insolvency proceedings in Palma on Monday. Budget airline <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/aug/29/zoom.air.travel\">Zoom, meanwhile, collapsed last month</a>.</p> <p><strong>'A huge failure'</strong></p> <p>XL's administrators Kroll said in a statement that its numerous businesses \"entered into administration having suffered as a result of volatile fuel prices, the economic downturn, and were unable to obtain further funding\".</p> <p>In a statement, XL's backers Straumur-Burdaras Investment Bank said it \"deeply regrets\" the collapse of the company and it is owed about \u20ac45m (\u00a335.8m) by the business.</p> <p>\"It is not clear at this stage to what extent this may be recovered,\" the company added.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/barclay\">Barclays</a>, meanwhile, is understood to be owed just under \u00a310m by the business.</p> <p>Straumur has bought out XL's German and French subsidiaries, whose customers are unaffected by the collapse of the UK operation.</p> <p>A spokesman for ATOL described XL UK's collapse as \"a huge failure\" and urged holidaymakers to be patient.</p> <p>\"With XL Airways no longer operating we are having to bring in substitute aircraft to bring people home. We ask people to be patient while we organise that ... bear with us, this is a huge failure. Our priority is the stranded passengers abroad and getting them back to the UK.</p> <p>\"Clearly if people do incur some additional costs, if they are delayed in their return, then they can put a claim in to the CAA under the ATOL scheme.\"</p> <p>In a statement, rival travel company <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/tuitravel\">TUI</a> - owner of Thomson and First Choice - called on the government to strengthen the protection given to holidaymakers when they book their trips, especially for holidaymakers who book online.</p> <p>\"In the current environment where the price of oil has increased substantially, we are continuously seeing airlines with less than robust business models failing,\" said Peter Long, chief executive, TUI Travel. \"This week alone both Futura and now XL have had to suspend or cease operations. Unfortunately, many people believe that they will be protected when this arises and this is not the case.\"</p> <p>\"Scheduled airlines, low cost airlines and online intermediaries, unlike tour operators, are not bonded which leaves their customers stranded or unable to get their money back in the event of failure. We at TUI Travel, as the leading European leisure travel company, will help where we can but it is time that the government realised that there needs to be a level playing field for all providers of overseas leisure travel arrangements.\"</p> <p>XL Leisure spans XL Airways UK Limited, Excel Aviation Limited, Explorer House Limited, Aspire Holidays Limited, Freedom Flights Limited, Freedom Flights (Aviation) Limited, The Really Great Holiday Company, Medlife Hotels Limited, Travel City Flights Limited and Kosmar Villa , all of which have been placed into administration.</p>",

The fire brigade is now dealing with the hot spots to make sure they don't flare up.\"</p> <p>French authorities said the main area of the fire \u2013 which reached temperatures of around 1,000C (1,832F) - was extinguished at 7am UK time, 16 hours after it had started. Firefighters then spent two hours putting out minor fires nearby.</p> <p>Thirty-two people were evacuated after the fire started just before 2pm UK time on a train carrying lorries from Folkestone to Calais.</p> <p>The blaze was thought to have started when a lorry on board caught fire and the inferno quickly engulfed other vehicles.</p> <p>Rescue teams arrived at the scene, about seven miles from the French end of the 31-mile undersea link, and 32 passengers - mostly lorry drivers and including seven British nationals - were evacuated through a service tunnel.</p> <p>Fourteen people were taken to hospital, some with respiratory problems due to smoke inhalation. There were no passenger trains in the tunnel at the time but there were truckers aboard the stricken freight train.</p> <p>One, Patrique Lejein, told reporters: \"We heard two loud bangs, like explosions, and suddenly thick smoke swept through the carriage. The train came to a grinding halt, we were all thrown forwards, the lights went out, and there was total mayhem - people just started to panic. We didn't know what had happened.\"</p> <p>He said the emergency exit jammed, and one passenger had to take a hammer to a window to get people out.</p> <p>Eurostar last night cancelled all today's train services causing huge tailbacks to motorists in Kent.</p> <p>Industry sources indicated some trains may start operating through one tunnel at the weekend at the earliest, meaning delays and cancellations would be inevitable.</p> <p>Eurostar will exchange tickets or refund money for those who do not want to travel after the incident. About 30,000 people were due to travel on 50 services between London, Brussels and Paris today.</p> <p>Two thousand passengers were stranded yesterday afternoon before Eurostar services were brought back to stations in London, Paris and Brussels. Another 15,000 who had been hoping to use the cross-Channel link last night were told their trains had been cancelled.</p> <p>At rush hour at Paris's Gare du Nord, there was anger and confusion as hundreds of mostly British passengers tried to find other ways to get home. John Jefferson, a pensioner from Cheshire, was part of a group of retired tourists who had just ended a holiday in the Loire.</p> <p>Their tour operator organised a coach to collect them from the Paris station and they were to travel by ferry, hoping to reach home by 4am.</p> <p>Jefferson said: \"Eurostar haven't handled this very well at all. There wasn't any sign of any significant management staff. You had about 300 confused and angry people [at the station] and Eurostar didn't seem to have any alternative plan. We were pretty cross they didn't seem interested.\"</p> <p>Other tourists from Britain were calling holiday firms trying to arrange last-minute accommodation in Paris.</p> <p>Kevin Parsons, a businessman from Buckinghamshire, joked that one of his colleagues had been told that they could sleep on the train. \"I'm past caring now,\" he said. \"But most guys in our group have families and they just want to get home to them.\"</p> <p>At about 7pm Paris time, Eurostar officials at Gare du Nord began handing maps and lists of local hotels to stranded British passengers. The company said it would reimburse them for taxis and hotels.</p> <p>One report on French radio noted: \"England is temporarily an island again.\"</p> <p>Severe tailbacks were reported near the tunnel in Kent and police advised drivers to avoid the area. Kent police later implemented Operation Stack on the M20, closing the coastbound carriageway between junctions eight and nine so that lorries could be parked on it. Non-freight traffic was diverted off the M20 at junction eight on to the A20.</p> <p>\"We are pulling out all the stops but it is going to be extremely busy,\" said Keith Southey, a spokesman for the Port of Dover. \"If people really need to travel then they have got to be prepared for delays.\"</p> <p>The tunnel was severely damaged by a fire on a shuttle train carrying lorries in November 1996. A total of 450 firefighters tackled the flames for just over seven hours but the concrete lining over about half a mile of tunnel was wrecked and \u00a3200m worth of damage was done.</p> <p>In August 2006, fire broke out on a lorry on a freight train about 7.5 miles from Folkestone.</p> <p><strong>Backstory</strong></p> <p>Eurostar started operating in 1994, since when it has carried more than 81 million travellers, including 8.26 million last year. It runs up to 17 services daily to Paris and 10 to Brussels through the Channel tunnel, the 31-mile link that is the longest undersea tunnel in the world.</p> <p>The tunnel cost \u00a310bn at today's prices to build - an 80% cost overrun - and the operating company has struggled under the debt burden ever since, though a restructuring deal last year eased the pressure.</p> <p>The tunnel's early years were dogged by punctuality problems and safety concerns, particularly after a fire in November 1996 created such damage that the tunnel was not fully operational for another six months.</p> <p>Services moved from Waterloo to St Pancras International in November last year and the journey time between London and Paris was slashed from 3 hours to 2 hours and 15 minutes thanks to the new high-speed link through Kent.</p>",
  "<p>Nine out of ten people will be better off under Liberal Democrat plans to cut taxes for the poorest, according to Nick Clegg.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat leader hopes the pledge will become the centrepiece of the party's autumn conference, which begins in Bournemouth tomorrow.</p> <p>Setting out his ambitions to in effect rebrand the Lib Dems from a third party wedded to tax-and-spend initiatives to a low-tax party with mass, mainstream appeal, he today called on activists to focus on the concerns of ordinary voters.</p> <p>Previously Lib Dem conference-goers have exposed the party to ridicule by demanding the legalisation of cannabis and the lowering of the pornography age limit from 18 to 16 years.</p> <p>\"This conference is very much about making sure our policies are bang up to date, really answering the needs and the everyday challenges facing British families,\" Clegg said.</p> <p>\"And I think the whole party's very committed to doing that, the constant need to make sure we are on the side of the vast majority of British families who are now going to find life a lot tougher than it has been for some time.\"</p> <p>Ahead of what will be his first autumn conference as leader, Clegg told a newspaper yesterday that any future tax cuts should start \"from the bottom up\".</p> <p>Lib Dems are gearing up for a fierce debate on tax at the seaside gathering as the leadership attempts to shake off the party's tax-and-spend reputation.</p> <p>Activists will be asked to approve plans to cut government expenditure by \u00a320bn. Clegg wants to use a chunk of these savings to cut taxes for low- and middle-income families.</p> <p>With badly stretched household budgets top of most voters' priorities, the leadership is convinced the shift is key to the party's electoral fortunes.</p> <p>They hope it will be a valuable contrast with a Labour government blamed for the economic strife and a Tory party, stung by previous defeats, refusing to rule out even having to raise taxes.</p> <p>But before wooing the electorate, Clegg must convince the left of his party to entirely reverse a strategy used in the last three general elections.</p> <p>His predecessor, Sir Menzies Campbell, saw off dissent to secure a commitment to a 4p cut in income tax funded by a big hike in green taxes and a crackdown on loopholes for the super-rich.</p> <p>That move, which included dropping the policy of a 50p rate for high earners, was tax-neutral - involving no reduction in public spending.</p> <p>Clegg wants to take the party a significant step further - seeking \u00a320bn of savings, from areas such as the NHS IT scheme, the Eurofighter project, ID cards and government advertising.</p> <p>The money will instead be spent on elderly care, extra resources for children from vulnerable backgrounds and housing.</p> <p>But Clegg has said that whatever is left would be channelled into tax cuts.</p> <p>\"The headroom that is left, the money that is spare, if you like, we will not seek simply to carry on spending,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We will seek to hand that back down from the bottom up, for people on ordinary incomes.\"</p> <p>Asked how much it would be, he said: \"It'll be in the billions, but I'm not going to specify that now.\"</p> <p>The conference will likely shine a spotlight on Clegg's leadership. Sections of the party have been unimpressed with his performance, <br>particularly his handling of the EU treaty referendum issue, which ended in a Commons revolt and three high-profile resignations.</p> <p>In an interview with the London Evening Standard yesterday, Clegg acknowledged the public was still \"getting to know him\".</p> <p>It followed a members-only survey by the Liberal Democrat Voice website that found one in three activists believed he had failed to make an impact since becoming leader.</p> <p>Chris Huhne, the man beaten to the top job and with whom Clegg became embroiled in a spat over the leadership at last year's conference, is one of those whose seats are vulnerable to the Tories.</p> <p>And there is bound to be a keen focus on the reception given to Treasury spokesman Vincent Cable, whose spell as caretaker leader proved a hit with the public, leading some to question whether he would not have been a better choice as leader.</p> <p>The past year has been a difficult one for the Lib Dems. The party has failed to make any significant advances in the polls while Tory ratings have soared and Labour's have declined.</p> <p>However, Clegg today insisted the party's mood was \"very good\" and rejected suggestions that the party was being squeezed by David Cameron, the Conservative leader.</p> <p>The conference is due to debate a number of other proposals, including moves to increase local accountability by making councils responsible for overseeing policing and to reverse the ban on standing at football matches. </p> <p>Eyebrows may also be raised at a proposal to put any new law to a referendum if a million voters object to it.</p> <h2>Guardian/Observer events at the Lib Dem conference</h2> <p><strong>Guardian debate: The next election - Threat or opportunity?</strong><br>Panel: Sir Menzies Campbell, Chris Huhne, Sarah Teather and Prof John Curtice<br>Monday September 15, 1pm-2pm<br>De Vere Suite, Royal Bath Hotel, Bournemouth</p> <p><strong>Observer interview: Andrew Rawnsley interviews Vincent Cable</strong><br>Tuesday September 16, 6.30pm-8pm<br>De Vere Suite, Royal Bath Hotel, Bournemouth</p>",
  "<p>It's 30 years since the Human League released their genre-defying debut single, Being Boiled. In 1978 it had no impact on my life whatsoever - it was never played on Ed \"Stewpot\" Stewart's request show, my one cultural reference point at the time. It was in the mid-80s, when I was in my early teens, that I managed to get a secondhand copy from Astonishing Sounds in Blackburn. The Human League's heavyweight hits had been ubiquitous in the preceding few years and I had soaked them up, but Being Boiled was different - darker, more atmospheric, less Smash Hits. </p> <p>Paper-round earnings funded the rapid gathering of the band's early output and one B-side, a curious instrumental track called Dancevision, really caught my ear. \"Recorded opposite Kelvin Flats, Sheffield on a budget Sony 2-track Nov 77 by Ian and Martin (sic) as The Future,\" the sleeve cryptically noted. It was hard to get information about what the Future was in the days before the internet: you had to go into the right record shop and hope the people behind the counter would share what they knew. \"They used to be called the Future, before Phil, but you can't get any of that stuff,\" I was told - it seemed the Future had morphed into the Human League sometime in 1977.</p> <p>I discovered my first unreleased tracks by the Future through the world of cassette bootlegs, with their lurid photocopied inlays and erroneous tracklistings. Through the tape hiss, the electronic music pulsated mechanically; it seemed almost steam-driven in sharp contrast to the sleeker synthesised sounds of the later Human League. I was hooked, but frustrated: I wanted to hear more, but there was no more to hear. Influenced by what I heard, I started recording myself, buying the cheap unwanted analogue synthesisers that littered the junk shops of the north-west, the instruments that made the very sounds I was listening to.</p> <p>Fast forward to 2003, and my records with Liberty X and Kelis both liberally sampled large chunks of the Human League's music. Through this, I met Sean Turner, curator of the Blind Youth website, which details the early career of the Human League. He had built up an amazing archive with the help of Dave Beevers, the Human League's musical director and gatekeeper of HL Studios. I was given several CDs of unreleased tracks, stretching right back to 1977. Here was the music I'd waited so many years to hear.</p> <p>My fandom kicked in again, and knowing the band hadn't always seen eye to eye with each other, I was pushing my luck when I approached them with the idea of doing a compilation of the Future. They agreed, and I was then in the strange position of juggling my own commitments with putting the compilation together - I'd be making phone calls to check we had the definitive version of Dada Dada Duchamp Vortex while I waited to go on Ant and Dec's TV show.</p> <p>The music on the album we've put together reveals the missing piece of the Human League's history and finally rescues it from the fate of being remembered only from those hissy bootleg tapes. With so little to do in Sheffield in the 70s, the Future used their imaginations to fashion music which took in all their disparate influences, from Bowie and sci-fi to the Michael Zager Band and Philip K Dick. From the early avant-garde tape experiments of Blank Clocks and Looking for the Black Haired Girls through to early synth-pop prototypes like Dance Like a Star, you can hear the gradual development of a band still years from megastardom. </p> <p>More than 20 years since I first heard the music of the Human League, it amazes me how much of an influence it's been on my life and my approach to music. Hopefully now, more people will be able to hear some of the music that shaped the future.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Golden Hour of the Future: Recordings By the Future and the Human League is released on September 22 on Black Melody.

  "<h2>Who are XL?</h2> <p>XL was the UK's third largest tour company, with brands including Freedom Flights, XL Airways, the Really Great Holiday Company, and Medlife Hotels. Through XL Airways it offered flights to 50 destinations, mainly in the Mediterranean.</p> <p>In June, it was reported it had made a \u00a324m loss in the last financial year and before its collapse it had been in talks with lenders to try and find a refinancing package, </p> <h2>How many people are affected?</h2> <p>The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) estimates that almost 300,000 customers will be affected by the collapse. There are around 50,000 customers currently abroad who booked their holiday through an XL operator, 10,000 who flew with XL Airways, and 25,000 holidaying with other tour operators who shared the XL flights. A further 200,000 people had booked holidays and flights for future dates.</p> <h2>What happens to people who are abroad?</h2> <p>The administrators say holidaymakers who bought package deals through XL should be able to stay in their hotel or villa and complete their holiday, and that in most cases the CAA will pay for this accommodation. Customers who are charged for their hotel or for transfers to the airport have been advised to keep any receipts as they may be eligible for a refund from the CAA.</p> <h2>Will they be able to get home?</h2> <p>XL's planes have been grounded and will not fly again, but the CAA is working with other airlines and travel companies to organise flights back to the UK. Customers who booked chartered flights or package holidays through one of XL's tour operators, or through a travel agent, will be able to fly back for free under the CAA's Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (Atol) scheme. Several airlines have already offered planes for the repatriation of passengers.</p> <p>Customers who booked direct with XL Airways (their flight numbers begin XLA) may be able to get a seat on one of these planes, but they will be charged for their journey. This is because they are not covered by the Atol scheme. The CAA was not able to say how much the fee might be.</p> <p>EasyJet has said where it has routes it will fly passengers not covered by Atol back to the UK for a flat rate of \u00a375, as long as they were due to return home before Saturday September 20. While Flybe is offering flights back from Alicante, Faro, Malaga and Palma for \u20ac90 (\u00a371).</p> <h2>What about people who have not started their holidays? </h2> <p>They will have to make alternative plans - XL planes won't be going anywhere and its accommodation will no longer be available. Other airlines have already reported a massive increase in demand for flights as XL customers try to make alternative arrangements - and prices are rising as a result. The cost of a flight from Glasgow to Tenerife, for example, has more than doubled to between \u00a3500 and \u00a3800. Prices for flights this evening have risen as high as \u00a31,800.</p> <h2>Will people get their money back?</h2> <p>Many will, but some will lose out. Customers who benefit from the Atol scheme should not be out of pocket. The CAA will provide a flight home, and will consider refunds for expenses that should have been covered by the package deal - such as transfers to the airport for the flight home. The Atol scheme will also offer a full refund to those who have not yet started their holiday. More details can be found <a href=\"http://www.caa.co.uk/atol.html\">on the Atol website</a>. </p> <p>However, holidaymakers who booked with XL Airways or Medlife Hotels will not be entitled to a refund, as these bookings are not covered by Atol. Whether they can get any kind of compensation will depend on how they paid for their holiday. </p> <p>Those who paid more than \u00a3100 on a credit card will be covered by section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, and will be able to get their money back from their card provider. Those who used a Visa debit card, or paid less than \u00a3100 on a credit card, should be able to get a refund under the chargeback scheme - users of other debit cards, however, have no protection.</p> <p>Holidaymakers who have travel insurance should check their policies, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/sep/12/consumeraffairs.travelinsurance\">the majority will not be able to make a claim</a>, as cover against airline failure does not come as standard. </p> <h2>What do they need to do now?</h2> <p>XL customers can <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/12/theairlineindustry.travelleisure1\">click here for more information</a> on what they should do, including phone numbers for hotlines set up to help stranded holidaymakers.</p>",

Firefighters then spent two hours smothering minor fires nearby, he said.</p> <p>Thirty-two people were evacuated after the fire started just before 2pm UK time on a train carrying lorries from Folkestone to Calais. </p> <p>Gerard Gavory, the sub-prefect of Calais, said this morning: \"The fire has been brought under control - it is not entirely out but we have mastered it. </p> <p>\"We had 200 firemen involved in the operation from our side and maybe 100 from the English side although I can't give you a precise figure. </p> <p>\"It is under control. That is a new piece of information. But we have to do more investigations and these will take a few hours.\"</p> <p>French firefighters rushed into the tunnel after an alarm was triggered on a freight shuttle train yesterday afternoon. </p> <p>The blaze was thought to have started when a lorry on board caught fire and the inferno quickly engulfed other vehicles.</p> <p>Rescue teams arrived at the scene, about seven miles from the French end of the 31-mile undersea link, and 32 passengers - mostly lorry drivers and including seven British nationals - were evacuated through a service tunnel.</p> <p>Fourteen people were taken to hospital, some with respiratory problems due to smoke inhalation. There were no passenger trains in the tunnel at the time but there were truckers aboard the stricken freight train.</p> <p>One, Patrique Lejein, told reporters: \"We heard two loud bangs, like explosions, and suddenly thick smoke swept through the carriage. The train came to a grinding halt, we were all thrown forwards, the lights went out, and there was total mayhem - people just started to panic. We didn't know what had happened.\"</p> <p>He said the emergency exit jammed, and one passenger had to take a hammer to a window to get people out.</p> <p>Eurostar last night cancelled all today's train services causing huge tailbacks to motorists in Kent.</p> <p>Industry sources indicated some trains may start operating through one tunnel at the weekend at the earliest, meaning delays and cancellations would be inevitable.</p> <p>Eurostar will exchange tickets or refund money for those who do not want to travel after the incident. About 30,000 people were due to travel on 50 services between London, Brussels and Paris today.</p> <p>Two thousand passengers were stranded yesterday afternoon before Eurostar services were brought back to stations in London, Paris and Brussels. Another 15,000 who had been hoping to use the cross-Channel link last night were told their trains had been cancelled.</p> <p>At rush hour at Paris's Gare du Nord, there was anger and confusion as hundreds of mostly British passengers tried to find other ways to get home. John Jefferson, a pensioner from Cheshire, was part of a group of retired tourists who had just ended a holiday in the Loire.</p> <p>Their tour operator organised a coach to collect them from the Paris station and they were to travel by ferry, hoping to reach home by 4am.</p> <p>Jefferson said: \"Eurostar haven't handled this very well at all. There wasn't any sign of any significant management staff. You had about 300 confused and angry people [at the station] and Eurostar didn't seem to have any alternative plan. We were pretty cross they didn't seem interested.\"</p> <p>Other tourists from Britain were calling holiday firms trying to arrange last-minute accommodation in Paris.</p> <p>Kevin Parsons, a businessman from Buckinghamshire, joked that one of his colleagues had been told that they could sleep on the train. \"I'm past caring now,\" he said. \"But most guys in our group have families and they just want to get home to them.\"</p> <p>At about 7pm Paris time, Eurostar officials at Gare du Nord began handing maps and lists of local hotels to stranded British passengers. The company said it would reimburse them for taxis and hotels.</p> <p>One report on French radio noted: \"England is temporarily an island again.\"</p> <p>Severe tailbacks were reported near the tunnel in Kent and police advised drivers to avoid the area. Kent police later implemented Operation Stack on the M20, closing the coastbound carriageway between junctions eight and nine so that lorries could be parked on it. Non-freight traffic was diverted off the M20 at junction eight on to the A20.</p> <p>\"We are pulling out all the stops but it is going to be extremely busy,\" said Keith Southey, a spokesman for the Port of Dover. \"If people really need to travel then they have got to be prepared for delays.\"</p> <p>The tunnel was severely damaged by a fire on a shuttle train carrying lorries in November 1996. A total of 450 firefighters tackled the flames for just over seven hours but the concrete lining over about half a mile of tunnel was wrecked and \u00a3200m worth of damage was done.</p> <p>In August 2006, fire broke out on a lorry on a freight train about 7.5 miles from Folkestone.</p> <p><strong>Backstory</strong></p> <p>Eurostar started operating in 1994, since when it has carried more than 81 million travellers, including 8.26 million last year. It runs up to 17 services daily to Paris and 10 to Brussels through the Channel tunnel, the 31-mile link that is the longest undersea tunnel in the world.</p> <p>The tunnel cost \u00a310bn at today's prices to build - an 80% cost overrun - and the operating company has struggled under the debt burden ever since, though a restructuring deal last year eased the pressure.</p> <p>The tunnel's early years were dogged by punctuality problems and safety concerns, particularly after a fire in November 1996 created such damage that the tunnel was not fully operational for another six months.</p> <p>Services moved from Waterloo to St Pancras International in November last year and the journey time between London and Paris was slashed from 3 hours to 2 hours and 15 minutes thanks to the new high-speed link through Kent.</p>",
  "<p>Tens of thousands of British holidaymakers have been stranded by the collapse of the UK's third largest tour operator.</p> <p>XL Leisure Group, based in Crawley, West Sussex, called in the administrators in the early hours of the morning after the failure of last minute talks with its financial backers Icelandic investment group Straumur.</p> <p>Its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/theairlineindustry\">fleet of planes have been grounded</a>, leaving an estimated 85,000 people stranded abroad, while a further 200,000 have made advance bookings with the company, many of whom will lose out.</p> <p>The company, which has a three year sponsorship deal with football club West Ham that is worth \u00a32.5m annually and is only in its first season, flies to more than 50 destinations across Europe and Africa and sells through tour operator brands including The Really Great Holiday Company and Aspire Holidays.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.caa.co.uk/\">Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)</a> is working with other airlines and tour operators to organise repatriation flights for package holiday travellers stranded abroad.</p> <p>It reckons there are 50,000 tour operator customers of XL already on holiday abroad, a further 10,000 overseas who had booked with XL Airways, and 25,000 with other tour operators who shared the XL flights.</p> <p>Anyone who booked an inclusive holiday with XL or a charter flight through four of XL's numerous brands - The Really Great Holiday Company, Kosmar Villa Holidays, Freedom Flights or Aspire Holidays - will be covered by <a href=\"http://www.atol.org.uk/\">ATOL</a>'s financial protection scheme.</p> <p>But anyone who booked direct with XL Airways - whose flight numbers begin XLA - will have to either buy their way on to the CAA's specially organised flights or make their own way home.</p> <p>Package holidaymakers who booked with XL's Medlife business are also not covered by ATOL and anyone already abroad will not automatically be brought home.</p> <p>Other airlines are already reporting a massive increase in demand for flights as XL customers try desperately to make alternative arrangements. The cost of a flight from Glasgow to Tenerife, for instance, has more than doubled to between \u00a3500 and \u00a3800. Prices for flights this evening have risen as high as \u00a31,800.</p> <p>The websites of both ATOL and the CAA, meanwhile, crashed this morning under the sheer weight of demand from worried XL customers. The helplines organised by the CAA, meanwhile, appeared permanently engaged.</p> <p>Anyone who booked their flights or a Medlife holiday with a credit card or Visa debit card will be able to reclaim their money from their card issuer.</p> <p>Many passengers may also be covered by their travel insurance.</p> <p>Transport secretary Ruth Kelly said: \"The CAA have a wealth of experience in dealing with these sorts of situations and are putting systems in place to get people home, while the government stands ready to provide the CAA with operational assistance should they need it.\"</p> <p>The CAA has recommended that anyone expecting to travel with XL should not travel to the airport. But the first indication that anything was wrong for many holidaymakers came as they reached the check-in desks this morning only to discover that their flight had been cancelled. </p> <p>The company is the 26th travel firm to go bust in less than a year, forced under by the twin pressures of rising fuel costs and tough financial markets.

  "<p>One of the marks of irrationality is failure to profit from experience. One of the marks of infantilism is a kneejerk desire to get one's own back, even at the expense of harming oneself. One of the marks of adolescent braggadocio is posing in front of a phalanx of press photographers without a shirt on, brandishing a gun or something equally <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/fotostrecke/fotostrecke-23978-2.html\">ithyphallic</a>, such as a very large fishing rod. </p> <p>Join up all these dots and you get a picture of Russia's posturing, pouting,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/gallery/2007/aug/14/russia.internationalnews?picture=330573277\">pectoral-flashing</a> Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>Mark one: Russia, despite violently denying self-determination to <a href=\"http://hrw.org/english/docs/2000/06/02/russia611.htm\">Chechnya</a>, has encouraged and rewarded it in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the break-away regions of Georgia. </p> <p>Now, to the amusement and delight of observers, it appears that little Tatarstan, the oil-rich region in the very heart of Russia, <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/09/10/asia/separatist.php\">wishes to become independent</a> <br>after the model of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. And no doubt other regions - including Chechnya again, when it has recovered from the pulverising Russia has given it - will begin to ask for the same courtesy as Putin has extended to the former regions of Georgia.</p> <p>Put this another way: Russia's efforts to weaken its neighbours and incrementally recover the empire lost upon the demise of the Soviet Union is proving to be its own undoing, because the more it nibbles at those neighbours by such means as it has used over Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the more it will encourage just such breakaway movements from within and around itself.</p> <p>So there is a lesson here: what you do can backfire. Now let us apply that lesson to Russia's renewed aid to Iran to build a<a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-35389620080909\">light-water reactor in Bushehr</a> in Bushehr, capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium, and to training Iranian nuclear scientists in Moscow. </p> <p>This strengthening of ties is seen by commentators as a Russian reaction (getting its own back; mark two) to US and western support for Georgia. But (mark one again) \"What you do can backfire\": Russia is helping Iran become a nuclear-weapons nation; Russia is helping a Muslim state (perhaps forgetting its own Muslim populations - for example in Chechnya - who might wish to secede, and who might invoke the aid of co-religionist neighbours in doing so) to acquire nuclear weapons. Hmmm\u2026 any chance that this might backfire too, literally as well as figuratively?</p> <p>And now (mark three) as to braggadocio. Some, including Putin, think it really cool that he ordered the invasion of Georgia while reclining at ease in his VIP seat in Beijing's Olympic stadium. He can cock a snook at everyone because he has his fingers on the taps of the pipes that send gas to Europe: if we get out of hand he can turn his hand, and we will squeal. This, though, (back to mark one yet again) can backfire: his pipeline westwards transmits gas, but the invisible pipeline running in the opposite direction transmits money. If he turns off the gas, he thereby turns off the money; and like the Middle Eastern countries waxing fat on the money we lavish on oil and gas, he is as drunk and dependent on the cash as we on the energy.</p> <p>Anyway, the point of mentioning all this is that in Putin's Russia we see the ballooning strength of yet another delinquent power. With China, Russia, religious fundamentalism, and the current (and possibly Palin-esque) US blundering around the crockery shop, most of the possibilities for our fragile world accordingly seem to be shattering ones.</p> <p>But - damn! - I forgot that I am not allowed to criticise Russia in this way, because of the crimes and follies of the US and the west in invading countries and encouraging break-away states and doing what it can to annoy its enemies. That is, I forgot the principles of blogic (ie the logic of the blogosphere): that if the west does anything wrong, then no one who lives in the west can criticise anyone else. </p> <p>Except - note this: westerners can and do disagree with what their own governments are doing, and their investigative journalists can investigate and criticise without the risk of getting murdered as a result - unlike journalists in Putin's Russian wonderland. In this little fact lies the token of a big difference, relevant to deciding which side one would take if forced.</p>",
  "<p>Passengers stranded at airports by <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/business/2008/sep/12/theairlineindustry.travelleisure2\">the collapse of XL</a>, Britain's third largest holiday firm, were today faced with having to fork out hundreds of pounds to go on holiday. </p> <p>Melanie Beadle, 42, from Mitcham, south London, who was going to Florida for two weeks with family and friends, said: \"We've now got to find somewhere that will give us a flight without costing us another mortgage. I feel devastated actually, really disappointed.\"</p> <p>She broke down in tears when told the company could not guarantee her accommodation. \"I can't believe this has happened to us, they have ruined everything.\" Her partner Terry Baldwin, 42, said: \"They're saying they were in talks last night. Why didn't they tell us before? They could have warned people. They still have the cheek to send us all the deal offers like car hire and passes to the theme park.\"</p> <p>Simon Ray, 62, from Ipswich, Suffolk, decided that paying twice for his Disneyworld Florida holiday for his wife and two children was too much. He said: \"They [XL] don't even know if the hotel has been paid for and I'm not paying for the hotel twice. They wanted us to pay \u00a35,000 more for our holiday. They just pulled the plug and have gone, leaving us all here. No one is helping us and it's not very professional.\"</p> <p>Mildred and Steve Simpson, from Islington, north London, were also meant to be flying to Florida, along with their 14-year-old daughter, Mary.</p> <p>Mrs Simpson, 46, said: \"We booked everything through XL Leisure Group; our flights, hotel, even our tickets to Disney World. We're absolutely gutted.</p> <p>\"We booked our insurance through another company though, so we should still be able to get other flights. We've been told we might as well try and book into the same hotel as it'll be empty now as everyone will have booked in through XL.\"</p> <p>Robert and Kelly Spurgeon said they had not been given any information other than that alternative flights to their destination of Tenerife could cost them anything up to \u00a32,000 each.</p> <p>The couple, from Norwich, said they had learnt that XL had gone into administration on the news in their hotel this morning but had thought they should come to the airport anyway.</p> <p>Mr Spurgeon, 30, who was also travelling with his five-year-old niece and seven-month-old son, said: \"We're meant to be staying in a timeshare so it's just waiting for us. I booked the flights through XL directly on my debit card so it doesn't look like I'm going to get anything back.</p> <p>\"We've not been told anything but my wife's been quoted \u00a32,000 for alternative flights. It's not the end of the world but it was going to be our son's first holiday so it would have been nice to have gone.\"</p> <p>At the Gatwick XL airways check-in desk, contracted staff were on hand to break the news to passengers. \"We've had people upset and disgruntled but there's been no moaning really,\" said an XL check-in attendant. \"There's not much we can tell them. Flights are cancelled, all of them. That's it.\"</p> <p>However, the screens in the North Terminal still listed two XL flights to Sanford in Florida and others to Tenerife, Skiathos and Hurghada. </p> <p>Around 2,000 passengers at Manchester Airport have been hit. </p> <p>A spokesman for Manchester Airport said: \"Passengers have two choices. They can either accept their fate that they are not going on holiday or they can try to rebook with another airline.\"</p> <p>XL Leisure Group chief executive Phil Wyatt said today he was \"devastated\" at the collapse of the holiday company and claimed his management team had \"worked night and day\" to try to refinance it.</p> <p>The company flies mainly from bases at Gatwick, Manchester and Glasgow airports.</p> <p>Business analysts were today warning that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/theairlineindustry\">the worst may not be over for the industry</a> with more carriers and tour operators expected to go under as the cost of aviation fuel soars. </p> <p>XL's demise follows the collapse of budget airline Zoom last month.</p>",
  "<p><br>Fabulous at fifty ... Prince, Madonna and Michael Jackson. Photographs: Frank Micelotta/Getty Images, Dave Hogan/Getty Images and Barbara Gindl/EPA</p> <p>At Fashion Rocks, Rihanna unveiled her unashamedly Europop cover of Madonna's Vogue \u2013 but website Hypeful went one, two, three times better. In honour of Madge and her brothers from another mother, Michael Jackson and Prince, turning the big five-oh, they gave us (yes you guessed it) <a href=\"http://www.hypeful.com/2008/09/04/the-big-5-0-150-cover-songs-of-madonna-michael-jackson-prince/\">50 covers each from the trio</a>. We've cherry-picked the most interesting ...</p> <p>Let's start with her Madgesty first...</p> <p>Iggy Pop and The Stooges raucous version of <a href=\"http://www.hypeful.com/wp-admin/mp3s/Burning%20Up%20_%20Ray%20of%20Light.mp3\">Burning Up</a> can perhaps be traced back to Madonna-obsessive bassist Mike Watt. His version can be heard on Sonic (nee Ciccone) Youth's Whitey Album (see also <a href=\"http://hypeful.com/wp-admin/mp3s/50popcovers/Get%20Into%20The%20Groove%20(Madonna).mp3\">Sonic Youth's Into The Groove</a>) which he recorded way back in the mid-80s. No wonder she got them to play at her Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame induction.</p> <p>Meanwhile it's no surprise <a href=\"http://hypeful.com/wp-admin/mp3s/50popcovers/Gone-1.mp3\">Juliana Hatfield</a> chose the contemplative 'Gone'. After being on the receiving end of major label shenanigans (Atlantic refused to release her 1997 album God's Foot), the lyrics about \"selling out\" and \"dream[ing] away your dream\" resonate. </p> <p>Malcolm Middleton's King Creosote-like take on <a href=\"http://boxstr.com/files/1737873_hyvkb/MiddletonStay.mp3\">Stay (from Like a Virgin)</a> is eye-wettingly pretty. In Madonna's version the track is yearning and pleading, but Middleton's has a veneer of fatalism and desperation about it. When he sings \"If you go/ I'd think of dying instead,\" you feel like he means it. </p> <p>Elsewhere, Annie Hardy puts her potty mouth to one side for Giant Drag's <a href=\"http://lusciousjackson.net/2008.08.16/Father.mp3\">psychedelic take on Oh Father</a>, <a href=\"http://hypeful.com/wp-admin/mp3s/50popcovers/Like%20a%20Virgin%20(Madonna)%20+%20Last%20Nite%20(The%20Strokes).mp3\">Ryan Adams takes the fun out of Like A Virgin</a> by trying to be too funny and there's no big surprise that that <a href=\"http://hypeful.com/wp-admin/mp3s/50popcovers/LikeAPrayer.mp3\">religiously conflicted Tori Amos</a> chose Like A Prayer.</p> <p>Over to the Michael Jackson collection! </p> <p>Ignore the Mika and KT Tunstall versions, it's <a href=\"http://hypeful.com/wp-admin/mp3s/50popcovers/IWantYouBack.mp3\">Nicklecreek's stripped down, bluegrass take</a> on I Want You Back which really thrills, sounding like the kids from Little House On The Prairie doing the Motown classic. You can almost hear the enthusiasm dripping out of your speakers. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hypeful.com/wp-admin/mp3s/Thriller%20(Michael%20Jackson%20cover).mp3\">Lightspeed Champion's take on Thriller</a> is notable for Dev Hynes' arrangement of the tune. Replacing the bold synth lines with Eugene McGuinness' violin gives the song a ramshackle, grot-rock sound. </p> <p>Ian Brown does a loveable double header of Thriller and Billie Jean. As lilting as the former is, it's <a href=\"http://hypeful.com/wp-admin/mp3s/50popcovers/ian_brown-billie_jean_session.mp3\">his version of Billie Jean</a> that is more memorable. With the spirit of Madchester looming, it's also delightfully daft - when singing the tracks paternity questioning lyrics, Brown sounds like a dodgy dad avoiding eye contact on the Jeremy Kyle show. Speaking of \"daft\", who could forget Charlotte Church and Amy Winehouse's <a href=\"http://hypeful.com/wp-admin/mp3s/50popcovers/Beat%20It.mp3\">tense take on Beat It</a>? Well here it is in all its glory. Was Winehouse drunk? Maybe, but with the visual element taken away, she sounds more lucid than memory serves. Although, admittedly, we still can't understand what she's singing about.</p> <p>And so finally, onto Prince. As Sinead O'Connor, Chaka Khan and Cyndi Lauper proved, you can't go too wrong with a Prince song \u2013 although <a href=\"http://hypeful.com/wp-admin/mp3s/50popcovers/Raspberry%20Beret.mp3\">Beck certainly tries</a>. After threatening to do Do Me Baby (thankfully he doesn't) he takes the psychedelic Raspberry Beret and gives it some impromptu, busker-like love. The spectre of a self-satisfied, irony-heavy slacker audience rears it head when Mr Hansen says it's a song by The Purple One but he wants to dedicate it to the other Purple One... Barney The Dinosaur. Does this guy ever stop? Oh my aching sides, etc...</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rockmusicdaily.com/media/bsides/Darling_Nikki.mp3\">Foo Fighters' Darling Nikki</a> is wonderful - partly because it's such a surprising choice and partly because Grohl sounds so engaged. Noted Prince-heads, the band also covered Vanity 6's Drive Me Wild but this is their definitive one. They bring out the songs' gothic charm and whip cracking menace. And it helps that the Nicest Guy In Rock sounds genuinely terrified/intrigued by deviant Nikki's naughty ways.</p> <p>I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man was demoed at the same time as When You Were Mine and it's Prince at his most New Wavey. My Morning Jacket retain the song's <a href=\"http://hypeful.com/wp-admin/mp3s/50popcovers/I%20Could%20Never%20Take%20the%20Place%20of%20Your%20Man%20(Prince).mp3\">country-rockin' grace</a>. The recording is not great but listen carefully and there are some great harmonies going on in the background.<br> The ever inventive Of Montreal do a pretty straightforward I Would Die 4 U, Well, straightforward aside from what sounds like North Sea drilling going on in the background. Much better is their <a href=\"http://hypeful.com/wp-admin/mp3s/50popcovers/Purple%20Rain%20(Prince).mp3\">air-punching version of Purple Rain</a>. It's a song which, like Billie Jean, is pretty hard to mess up. <a href=\"http://hypeful.com/wp-admin/mp3s/50popcovers/01%20Purple%20Rain%20(Prince%20Cover).mp3\">Kate Nash tries, though</a>, by cracking up mid-song and (quite literally) bursting into falsetto. </p> <p>Meanwhile <a href=\"http://www.jessicalynncombs.com/media/Ani_Difranco_Aimee_Mann_-_When_Doves_Cry_Live_.mp3\">Ani DiFranco and Aimee Mann's When Doves Cry</a>, depressingly sounds like Jack Johnson playing at FarmFest in 1992. Patti Smith's <a href=\"http://www.suzaneraslan.com/resonator/Patti_Smith-When_Doves_Cry.mp3\">surprisingly funky version</a> is much prettier, putting the songs parental angst to the core. </p> <p>What else? Well Gary Numan's <a href=\"http://hypeful.com/wp-admin/mp3s/50popcovers/07%20U%20Got%20The%20Look%20(prince).mp3\">industro-pop version of U Got The Look</a> is pretty shocking - it sounds a little too much like Tom Jones's steroid take on Kiss for our liking. Perhaps our favourite of the bunch, though, is <a href=\"http://www.subverse.org/Music/Sunday_Mix_5_20_2007/Paisley%20Park%20(Prince%20cover).mp3\">Richard Swift's lovely Paisley Park</a>. In keeping with the song's Beatles-indebted spirit, he takes it to the next level. The result? Erm, it sounds like a Muppets song. Marvellous.</p> <p>What's your favourite? And has the list missed any great covers? Let us know.</p>",

  "<p>This week marks the 20th anniversary of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Delors\">Jacques Delors</a>' speech to the Trades Union Congress outlining the basis of a \"<a href=\"http://www.etuc.org/r/816\">social Europe</a>\" in which solidarity and co-operation would exist alongside economic competition and enterpreneurship. The British Labour movement, having endured nearly 10 years of Thatcherism, embraced the possibility of a political arena where they could fight for workers' rights. </p> <p>The EU, largely speaking, has been a positive force for workers, enshrining in its work the trade union values of social inclusion and solidarity, welfare states and public services, and worker participation and collective bargaining. Through <a href=\"http://www.civitas.org.uk/eufacts/OS/OS10.htm\">various decisions</a>, in particular those applying the Social Chapter introduced as part of the Maastricht Treaty, the EU has provided and safeguarded important rights including maternity pay and parental leave, paid holiday as well as a series of health and safety legislation. </p> <p>Our European social model proves it is possible to maintain economic growth alongside high levels of employment with high social security spending and quality public services available to all. Indeed, recent levels of economic growth in the EU are better \u2013 and certainly more equitable \u2013 than the deregulated USA.</p> <p>However, in recent years, social Europe has floundered. Its previous achievements remain on the statute book, but new ones are few and far between. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barroso_Commission\">Barroso Commission</a> has had a somewhat one-sided focus on market liberalisation which, combined with the lack of progress in the review of the decade-old directive on working time and the delays in adopting a directive on vulnerable temporary agency workers, is leading to rising trade union dissatisfaction. This is in danger of expressing itself in a growing scepticism about the value and purpose of European integration. </p> <p>The political repercussions have started to be felt. In September last year, trade union frustration at the lack of progress in resolving the Working Time and Temporary Agency Workers directives and the protocol negotiated by the UK on the Charter of Rights, boiled over, with TUC Congress approving a motion tabled by the normally pro-European GMB, calling for a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. </p> <p>Moreover, the \"Vaxholm\" and \"Viking\" and other cases, where the European Court of Justice appeared to rule that an employer's right to \"freedom of established\" took precedence over the right of unions to strike, were perceived by the ETUC as a further slap in the face.</p> <p>But the balance sheet can be changed. It is ultimately the results of political choices expressed in legislation that determine how social Europe is, and the court simply clarifies the meaning of existing legislation, which has been to have unexpected loopholes which can and must be corrected. </p> <p>Legislative priorities also include the need to build on the government's compromise between business and unions and break the deadlock on temporary agency workers \u2013 a major priority which should be adopted by the European Parliament before the end of this year. They also include the revision of the Working Time directive, proposals for stronger anti-discrimination legislation, amendments to the European Works Council Directive, which gives 10 million workers across the EU the right to information and consultation on company decisions, and consultation rights for workers on cross-border takeovers.</p> <p>The Tories oppose these advances for social Europe and are seeking to turn back the clock on EU laws that protect workers. David Cameron has pledged that a Tory government would take Britain out of the Social Chapter \u2013 a bold promise that offers a clear dividing line between Labour and the Conservatives and, unwittingly, highlights one of the strengths of having social protection legislation at EU rather than national level. As restoring Britain's opt-out would require the agreement of every EU country, it would be very difficult for Cameron to repeal the Social Chapter.</p> <p>We cannot return to the isolationist stance of the 1980s when Labour clung to the wrong-headed mantra that the EU was a \"capitalists' club\". This is a recipe for political impotence, and would leave us isolated from our socialist colleagues in the European Parliament and fellow trade-unionists in the ETUC. Rather, we should join with them to ensure that our single European market is not a free-for-all for multinational companies but is a rules-based, socially just economic system that protects the weak and vulnerable from the full harshness of unrestrained market forces. The EU is a political and social and project \u2013 as Delors put it in his TUC speech: \"No one falls in love with a market\".</p> <p>This is the battle that Labour MEPs are engaged in week-in and week-out in the European Parliament in adopting, rejecting or amending European legislation. The common rules that we have laid down for the common market on consumer protection, environmental standards, workplace rights, health and safety legislation and such like is fundamental to this. We do not win every battle, but with our colleagues in the Socialist Group in the European parliament we can, and do, make a real difference.</p> <p>Delors' speech in 1988 prompted Ron Todd, the TUC chairman at the time, to comment that after nearly 10 years of Thatcherism the EU was \"the only card game in town\". After more than a decade of a Labour government, Europe is self-evidently no longer the only game in town. But like national politics, it remains a political battleground that makes decisions that affect our daily lives. Abandoning this battlefield would leave the way clear for the unrestrained and unregulated free trade that the Conservatives dream of. The social vision of Europe is central to the intellectual armoury of the centre-left and is too important not to fight for \u2013 and, as the Socialist vice-president of the Commission, Margot Wallstrom, recently said, \"the right of collective bargaining and action is not secondary to internal market rules\". It's time to make this a reality.</p>",
  "<p>A hawkish and occasionally combative Sarah Palin warned last night she might commit US troops to a war against Russia in defence of Georgia and Ukraine in her first interview since John McCain chose her as his running mate.</p> <p>Palin, who admitted last night she made her first trip outside North America last year, also said she was certain she was ready to step in for McCain as president, if the Republican nominee were to be incapacitated. She said repeatedly she would not hesitate to use all options in an international crisis or resort to force against Islamist extremists.</p> <p>\"I have the confidence in that readiness and knowing that you can't blink. You have to be wired in a way of being so committed to the mission, the mission that we're on, reform of this country and victory in the war, you can't blink,\" Palin told ABC television.</p> <p>Palin's interview was carefully stage-managed to counter criticism that she lacks foreign policy experience and to deflect media scrutiny of her personal life. But her occasionally stilted answers and uncompromising view of the world could sit uneasily with American voters, weary of the war on Iraq and the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan.</p> <p>In sometimes tense exchanges, Palin demonstrated a more bellicose posture towards Russia than the Bush administration during the conflict with Georgia. She also supported military action against Islamist extremists in Pakistan even without the support of the Islamabad government.</p> <p>Asked whether Nato membership would commit the US to going to war on behalf of Ukraine and Georgia if they were attacked, Palin said: \"Perhaps so. I mean, that is the agreement when you are a Nato ally. If another country is attacked, you're going to be expected to be called upon and help. What I think is that smaller democratic countries that are invaded by a large power is something for us to be vigilant against.\"</p> <p>She advocated speeding up full Nato membership for Georgia and Ukraine despite warnings from Moscow that it views attempts to expand US influence among the former Soviet states as provocative. Russia's invasion of Georgia was \"unprovoked\", she said and warned that America could not allow Moscow to control vital energy supplies. \"We've got to keep an eye on Russia. For Russia to have exerted such pressure in terms of invading a smaller democratic country, unprovoked, is unacceptable,\" she said.</p> <p>Last night's broadcast was the first of four programmes based on interviews with Palin conducted in her home town of Wasilla and Fairbanks both in Alaska.</p> <p>The broadcasts will include footage of Palin's soldier son, Track, who was scheduled to deploy to Iraq yesterday. The Alaska governor, who touts herself as a moose-hunting, salmon-fishing, hockey mom turned political reformer, has faced a steady drip of negative stories about her record and her family including daughter Bristol, who is pregnant at 17.</p> <p>Until the interviews, she had not taken questions from reporters, and at campaign rallies stuck closely to a scripted speech that is largely a distillation of her address to the party convention.</p> <p>McCain's strategists are working hard to capitalise on Palin's appeal to Republican women as well as some former supporters of Hillary Clinton. Palin's instant popularity and the success of Republican effort to present her as a feminist icon, have put the Democrats off balance.</p> <p>Meanwhile Barack Obama made a belated personal appeal to Bill Clinton yesterday for advice on how to mount a fightback and reverse a slide in the polls.</p> <p>Talking to journalists before they began lunch, Clinton said: \"I predict that Senator Obama will win and win pretty handily.\"</p> <p>Obama added: \"You can take it from the president of the United States. He knows a little something about politics.\"</p> <p>Obama said he saw parallels between his campaign and Clinton's in 1992: a relatively unknown politician fighting the Republicans against a backdrop of an ailing economy. After the lunch, a joint statement issued on behalf of the two by Obama's team, said: \"They discussed the campaign briefly, but mostly talked about how the world has changed since September 11 2001. They also spoke about what the next president can do to help make the economy work for all Americans, as it did under president Clinton.\"</p>"
