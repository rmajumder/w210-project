  "<p>On September 16 2007, private forces working for the secretive mercenary company Blackwater went on a shooting spree in Baghdad's Nissour Square that left 17 Iraqi civilians dead, among them women and children. This revelatory account of the emergence of Blackwater as one of the most powerful players in America's \"war on terror\" - with a military base, a fleet of aircraft and 20,000 troops - delves into one of the most chilling outrages of our time: the privatisation of war. Taking us from the bloodied streets of Iraq to hurricane-ravaged New Orleans, Scahill demonstrates the widespread outsourcing of military tasks to a private company. Bankrolled by right-wing millionaire Eric Prince, and with expensive Washington lobbyists helping to score millions in government contracts, Blackwater's corporate goal is \"to do for the national security apparatus what FedEx did to the postal service\". Free from the rules that limit regular soldiers, companies like Blackwater are finding opportunity where others see only adversity.</p>",

  "<p>The number of times I've started this letter in my head then metaphorically ripped it up, and yet I'm compelled to write it again. In a better, more logical, less desperate way. But each subsequent version is equally self-indulgent, foolish and gets chucked in the metaphorical bin.</p> <p>Yet while there remains the narrowest sliver of doubt, I am compelled to chase the right words, to chase you. I am compelled to tell you that I love you, in case you have changed your mind. In case, like me, you want to get in touch but think you shouldn't because we said we wouldn't. In case you have the same ache that I have; a high-pitched, ringing tinnitus of a thing that sends me to my bed but stops me sleeping.</p> <p>S is too young and self-absorbed to notice, but poor, kind, sensitive B can sense the misery seeping out of my bones. At 12, he's helpless to diagnose and prescribe, so he strokes my arm and kisses my cheek, offers cups of tea and succeeds only in making me feel more wretched that its the summer holidays and I'm worrying the sunny days out of him.</p> <p>P knows nothing of you; knows little any more about him and me. Only that our marriage is shakier this summer than last. While there is ambiguity with you, there is certainty for both of us that the marriage has run its course. Except we have yet to reach the point where going on is no longer viable. For now, we continue to make domestic arrangements, pursue family days out. The facts have yet to be faced, the detail has yet to be drawn. And while I wait for the inevitable, I can't describe the leaps I make at the tring of an incoming text or the number of times a day, an hour, I check my mobile since our resolution to \"leave it\".</p> <p>\"Do you want to leave it?\" is a fine example of how infinitely inadequate text-speak really is. Its a shorthand with a casualness that belies the enormity of letting you go.</p> <p>The final few texts to you were demanding and aggressive when I read them back, but thats not how they were sent. They were sent with kisses and affection. Remember the one: \"Any words of love and lust as I make my way to the office?\" I was thinking of the outrageous knights and stallion text you sent, which arrived at the exact moment my boss walked into the office and how we laughed about it in bed that evening. But there's not enough screen space to say all that. I simply sounded too needy.</p> <p>Texts strip a sentence down to a series of abbreviations that can easily be misinterpreted: \"Pls spend all day thinking about when/where we can meet\" reads back like a barked order, but as I pressed send there was only a delicious dream in my head of us holed up somewhere remote. Now I can't help thinking that if my texts had been less persistent, if I hadn't kept texting suggestions for when/how we could meet, I'd still be anticipating our next kiss.</p> <p>Of course, I shan't get in touch. Your text said you were struggling with \"us\" in the new circumstances. I was too, but in the opposite way. After three weeks without you, I needed to look into your deeply blue eyes, talk to you, kiss you as we talked. But you couldn't lie to your partner to be with me. I'm acutely aware that, before that reckless first kiss, you were planning a way of spending more time at home, and now you are there.</p> <p>That you haven't been in touch since that final text confirms to me that I need to concede defeat. But then you wouldn't dream of breaking your word even if you had changed your mind. So I return again and again to that sliver of ambiguity. You promised to pursue me. You said, \"One day we will go to Lucy's for lunch then make love by the lake.\" There was a sense of longevity in your assertion.</p> <p>I need to check that you're quite sure you don't want to see me anymore. Quite, quite sure. Texts are easy to misinterpret. This letter is not. It is self-indulgent, foolish. Probably best not sent.</p> <p>\u2022 We will pay 100 for every \"Letter to ... \" we publish.

  "<p>\"We have become irrevocably more global.\" This sentiment is often repeated, but it was uttered in an unusual context earlier this month by the new president of the International Federation of Philosophical Societies, William McBride, at the conclusion of the five-yearly World Congress of Philosophy in Seoul. We're used to thinking about the globalisation of business and culture, but not of ideas.</p> <p>Whereas in most arenas globalisation tends to be taken to be a euphemism for westernisation, in philosophy it implies quite the opposite. The host nation Korea is a case in point. In the era of Japanese colonial rule, from 1910, study of Asian philosophy was all but wiped out. In its place came the western, usually German, tradition of Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche. Surprisingly, this orthodoxy was not imposed by the west, but by oriental Japan. It is only recently that indigenous philosophical traditions have begun to be taken seriously in Korean universities, and even now their study comprises only a third of the philosophy in higher education.</p> <p>The same pattern is emerging in other non-western nations. An Ethiopian philosopher, Workineh Kelbessa Golga, for instance, told me that his country's only philosophy department has conducted a lot of field work interviewing indigenous philosophic sages. </p> <p>Sometimes, this rediscovery of the local is accompanied by outright hostility to the western tradition. More than one speaker at the congress condemned \"western logic\" for imposing a too rigid \"either/or\" system of thought. But more often the desire was simply to promote a more pluralistic approach. This pluralistic agenda again contradicts one of the clich\u00e9s of globalisation: that it leads to a more uniform world. The globalisation of ideas looks like being a force for diversity, not homogeneity.</p> <p>But isn't there a worry that promoting the local rather the global in the realm of ideas will drive people further apart? Not according to Darryl Macer, who is running a Unesco project on Asian-Arab philosophic dialogue, several meetings of which were held at the congress. He believes you can increase dialogue across cultures by promoting the study and awareness of different philosophical traditions. This kind of unity in diversity is not as daft as it sounds: debate can take place only against a background where each participant is recognised as having something valuable and distinctive to contribute.</p> <p>The congress as a whole exemplified this principle. FISP had become \"irrevocably more global\" precisely because it had become more plural and international. The approach contrasts with the kind of parochialism that focuses on the local as though it were universal. For instance, in Britain, philosophy at Oxford and Cambridge has at times been so insular that people doing it there scarcely counted anything else as proper philosophy at all. </p> <p>It may be that we we can apply these lessons from the global exchange of of ideas to globalisation in the broader sense. For instance, many corporations are finding that their first attempts at global domination have come up against regional differences which have forced them to adapt. Starbucks has just made a massive retreat in Australia, which just didn't buy it, while McDonald's has got much more savvy in recent years about tailoring its offering to local demands. The free movement of goods, like the free movement of ideas, might just work better when there is more choice available, choice which reflects the different traditions of the trading nations. That way, globalisation need not always mean westernisation or standardisation.</p> <p>Whether or not the markets in ideas and goods are analogous, on the evidence of the congress the globalisation of ideas promises to inject fresh life into intellectual debates around the globe. Expect to read much more about how thoughts originating in unfamiliar times and places might help us to think about the here and now.<br><strong>Julian Biaggini</strong></p> <p>Margaret Thatcher reportedly kept Kipling's verse in her handbag, while Harold Macmillan and John Major munched their way through the novels of Anthony Trollope. David Cameron's literary tastes, however, are less predictable, judging by the curious exercise called Cameron on Cameron. The Tory leader enthuses to Dylan Jones about Sebastian Faulks's Enderby (\"brilliantly written\"), giving away the plot, and Ian Fleming's thrillers, but says \"my favourite novel would have to be Our Man in Havana or The End of the Affair ... [when young] I went through a manic Graham Greene phase and read every single novel. In fact I'm quite looking forward one day to reading them all again because I've forgotten them all. I just think he is wonderful, brilliant.\"</p> <p>Indeed, but also a leftwinger who regularly attacked US imperialism and supported movements such as the Sandinistas, who despised Ronald Reagan and was a friend of Fidel Castro. We'll have to await a more probing interviewer than Jones to learn how adoring his writing fits with rejecting his politics; but being a Greene fan seems of a piece with Cameron's naughty penchant for radical bands such as the Smiths and the Jam. Explaining his much-ridiculed choice of Paul Weller's anti-toff polemic \"The Eton Rifles\" as a favourite song earlier this year, he said: \"I don't see why the left should be the only ones allowed to listen to protest songs.\" <br><strong>John Dugdale</strong></p> <p>Did Alasdair Gray's Boswell save his life? It's a possibility raised by a bizarre incident towards the end of Rodge Glass's Alasdair Gray: A Secretary's Biography, when Glass - a novelist who for many years was the Glaswegian writer's amanuensis - and an intoxicated Gray were in Edinburgh during the festival. Suddenly Gray inexplicably broke into a run down the cobbled High Street with his secretary/biographer chasing, tripped, and \"went flying, head first, arms down at his side like a diver unafraid of hitting the pool head-first\". </p> <p>Fearful that his employer's \"skull could be splattered like a watermelon dropped from a great height\", Glass then somehow found himself lying underneath Gray, but unsure if he had thrown himself down heroically or simply tripped too. At any rate, the eccentric author's recovery was swift: once he'd heaved himself upright with a handy chain, Gray declared: \"You know, Rodge, sometimes I think women's bottoms are the only thing in the world that matters.\"<br><strong>JD</strong></p> <p>When is a chimp not a chimp? When it's the author of a book settling scores with some of the highest-carat figures from the golden age of Hollywood. Cheeta, we learn from his \"autobiography\" - longlisted this week for the Guardian first book prize - loved his Tarzan co-star Johnny Weissmuller, but couldn't see the point of Maureen O'Sullivan, aka Jane. Nor could she of him. Plausible enough, but the question that will face the Waterstone's reading groups as they whittle the 10 longlisted books down to a shortlist of five, is whether Me Cheeta is fact or fiction.<br><strong>Claire Armitstead</strong></p>",
  "<p>After she'd opened the show for the American jazz vocals star Kurt Elling at the Barbican last year, Elling lost no time in leading the applause for the UK's Claire Martin, who had put the audience in just the frame of mind to understand what creative jazz singing is all about. Later in 2007, Martin was also one of the most personable and inventive contributors to a London Jazz Festival Ella Fitzgerald tribute- all confirmation of why the London-born, Betty Carter-inspired singer is admired as much by her singing peers - from Noel Gallagher to Mark Murphy - as by audiences. Aside from the technical control which lets her shift from deep purr to coolly loping swing in a blink, Martin is also a designer of unusual repertoires - her set on the Elling show included Michael Franks' coolly hip Jive and Sting's St Augustine In Hell. Martin has been collecting jazz awards since the mid 1990s, but her confidence has never been greater. </p> <p>\u2022 Ronnie Scott's Club, W1, Mon 1 to Wed 3</p>",
  "<p>With its beech avenue, lime walk and nearby neolithic stone circle, Cheverell Manor offers the visitor \"a confident reconciliation of grace and strength\"; while the cosmetic surgery clinic tucked away in its west wing finances owner George Chandler-Powell's life of restrained luxury. But the murder of Rhoda Gradwyn, one of his patients, unleashes a vortex of doubt and suspicion, which, by the end of the affair, will draw in not only the surgeon, his staff and their close relations, but also Adam Dalgliesh and the officers of the Special Investigations Squad. For Rhoda Gradwyn was the most notorious of investigative journalists, and there is dirt to dig even at the Manor - perhaps especially at the Manor. It's a given that everyone has something to conceal, so whether he's faced with the burning of a witch in 1654, or the grim discovery of a dead claustrophobe in a locked freezer today, the experienced investigator must always begin by asking himself: where does hiding end and privacy begin?</p> <p>PD James is a career gymnast, entertaining us with her inventive mastery of that limiting apparatus, the classic English mystery novel. Her 14th Adam Dalgliesh story has most of the familiar elements. There's the will - possibly forged. There's the country house in the creepy setting. There are weak-willed relatives - mostly distant; and a strong-willed servant who says \"fuck\" where her fictional predecessors said, \"I'm sure I don't know, Ma'am.\" There are comings and goings in the night, morally and ethically significant coincidences on which the plot hinges, a comic gardener called Mogworthy, and at least one instance in which the complete cast of suspects is assembled in the library. Two things are missing, however. One of them is Adam Dalgliesh himself, who, though he's on the case, seems much of the time only a molecule thick.</p> <p>The other is the sinewy flexibility of technique that linked form to theme in novels like Cover Her Face. For three quarters of The Private Patient, while we have the structure of a mystery, we don't have the surface. Landscapes and interiors, an organic presence in previous Dalgliesh novels, seem bolted on directly from the author's notes. The themes - of privacy, modesty and self-control - are present and correct, recognisably Jamesian; but where previously they were enacted, teased out of testimony, reflected and reversed by a symbology as layered as the plot itself, they now plonk themselves down in front of us barely mediated. Characterisation, which, with a patrician lack of haste, undid itself even as it built itself up, is reduced to a kind of box-ticking. Detectives and suspects alike face front squarely and announce themselves.</p> <p>What they announce isn't particularly likeable. Self-starters once, they now find themselves on the mature part of the career curve. The word most often used about them is \"control\": the women take it, the men take even more of it. Control is achieved by winning a dialogue or ordering something from a servant; or, in the longer term, by being Europe's top something. A colleague of Dalgliesh's is \"one of the most highly regarded forensic pathologists in Europe\", while the detective's opposite number among the suspects - a man with a \"reassuring authoritative presence\" - is one of Europe's pre-eminent plastic surgeons. A solicitor brings with him \"the confidence of assured metropolitan success\"; and of Mrs Rayner, the visiting probation officer, we're assured: \"Everything about her spoke of authority quietly and confidently exercised\". Some part of the personality, Dalgliesh thinks, always remains inviolate. These people have secured so much of their personalities against violation that they hardly exist at all.</p> <p>How unlikeable does the author suppose them to be? It's hard to say. One of the most absent characters here - and not because she's dead for most of the text - is Rhoda Gradwyn herself. Even those descriptions of her made from her own point of view, as she prepares for her stay at Cheverell Manor, are of a woman fastened down tight; the focus is on the details of leaving her house; and her feelings are compressed into the acts of switching off a lamp or locking a door. The puzzle is not so much why someone killed Rhoda, as why her emotional life was so evacuated. There's a nice irony in making a muckraker the most inscrutable person in your text (a thought not lost on Dalgliesh himself). But James's ironies are always overpowered by her instinctive wince away from the affect. The characters most likely to reveal their character - to \"give themselves away\" in every sense of that expression - are handled not just with overt contempt, but with almost comical stiffness and ineptitude. Their displays seem as deeply embarrassing to the author as to the rest of the cast, among whom secure barriers of bracingly \"frank\" politeness and rule-bound social exchange are erected even in the bedroom.</p> <p>For most of the novel you wish someone would murder the lot of them. Then, at the very end, with the crime almost solved and the unsolveability of human beings confirmed, something strange happens. Baroness James, one of Europe's most distinguished mystery novelists, renews her interest in her own book.

  "<p><strong>This time it's personal</strong> <br>What's the point in us dutifully shredding sensitive documents and guarding our pin numbers with our life when - thanks to the actions of some idiot - our bank details can end up being sold on eBay? That's the question many people will be asking after it emerged this week that a computer holding a million people's personal details was flogged on the auction site for \u00a335. Account numbers, phone numbers, mothers' maiden names and signatures of American Express, NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland customers were reportedly found on the hard drive. It's the latest in a long line of ID scares. The authorities need to clamp down hard on this sort of cock-up. Big fines need to be imposed and heads need to roll.</p> <p><strong>Bringing up baby </strong><br>Scamsters have dredged new lows in their attempts to con money out of people. An IT security firm is warning computer users of a widespread spam campaign which pretends that the recipient's baby has been kidnapped in a bid to infect his or her PC with malicious software. The emails, says Sophos, carry the subject line \"We have hijacked your baby,\" and claim that a $50,000 (\u00a327,000) reward must be paid for the child's safe return. If you open the attachment, it unleashes a virus designed to infect your computer, allowing hackers to take control and steal information.</p> <p><strong>Bank underwear </strong><br>A man who chose \"Lloyds is pants\" as his telephone banking password says he found it had been changed by a member of staff to \"no it's not\". Steve Jetley, from Shrewsbury, says he chose the password after falling out with Lloyds TSB over insurance that came free with an account, according to the BBC News website. He was then banned from changing it back, or to another password of \"Barclays is better\". The bank has said sorry and says the staff member no longer works there.</p> <p><strong>Power pop </strong><br>During the past couple of years, Guardian Money has carried several reports about websites aiming to cut record label bosses out of the equation and hand more power and profits to the musicians and their fans. In 2006, a website called SellaBand went live, and several others - including Amazingtunes and Slicethepie - followed last year. This week, the Guardian revealed that the music executives behind Kaiser Chiefs and Primal Scream are backing a new site called Bandstocks that will allow music fans to invest financially as well as emotionally in hotly tipped new acts. It will be interesting to see if any of these sites can succeed in becoming a real force in the music game.</p> <p><strong>CDs for cash </strong><br>If investing in unknown acts sounds risky, how about a new online service that lets you convert your old or unwanted CDs into cash? Musicmagpie (<a href=\"http://www.musicmagpie.co.uk\">www.musicmagpie.co.uk</a>) pays 25p to \u00a33 each for CDs that users send in via its free trade-in service. \"Each year, over \u00a321m in old CDs are thrown away in the UK when they could be converted into cash,\" says a spokesman. Simply type in the barcode number from the discs you want to sell. The website will search its database and make a cash offer for each one.

  "<p>Two weeks ago Dr Anne Guilding and her friends were relaxing in a restaurant, celebrating her son's wedding the day before. The food, wine and conversation were flowing. But then it suddenly turned ugly. No, there wasn't a bust-up between the in-laws. It was because one of the diners dared ask for some tap water so she could take a tablet.</p> <p>\"We had already spent hundreds of pounds, buying wine and expensive sparkling water. So I was gobsmacked when the waiter refused to bring us a jug of tap water, or even a glass. He told us it wasn't the restaurant's policy to serve tap water,\" says Guilding, whose party at the Brasserie El Prado in Bridgend included a member of the Welsh Assembly and a visiting American astonished that British restaurants don't automatically serve free water.</p> <p>\"I asked to speak to the manager, and explained that we had bought plenty of drinks and wanted some normal water. One member of the party needed to take medication and we did not consider asking for a jug of water unreasonable. He flatly refused to let us have any, reiterating that it was not the restaurant's policy.\"</p> <p>Guilding left the restaurant angry, embarrassed and humiliated. But ultimately the restaurant was the loser - the group decided not to leave a tip. The restaurant's owner, Jesus Decelas, says: \"Water costs us, the ice costs us, the lemon costs us. I have to charge.\" </p> <p>According to the National Consumer Council, Guilding's experience is depressingly common in Britain. Its research found that nine out of 10 restaurants fail to offer free tap water.</p> <p>A look at the Consumer Council for Water's website, where restaurant-goers can post reports of restaurant behaviour, reveals widespread anger and indignation about charging for tap water.</p> <p>One poster, \"Sharon\", says: \"When I was in Burger King recently, I started coughing and asked for some tap water. They refused even though I had tears running down my cheeks, as I struggled to stop coughing. They did offer to sell me a bottle of water; however, I decided to buy a coke instead as that was cheaper. Apparently, they don't 'do' tap water!\" Burger King told Guardian Money that the restaurant was wrong. It is company policy to provide customers with tap water on request.</p> <p>At a wedding in Birmingham, the hotel demanded \u00a35 per bottle of water placed on tables, and resisted fiercely when the couple asked for jugs of tap water instead. Pubs are named and shamed for charging as much as \u00a31 for a glass of tap water. Airports and railway stations are regularly cited as money-grabbers, removing free water fountains and effectively forcing travellers to buy bottled water at food outlets.</p> <p>Some restaurants even tell customers that water can't be provided for \"health and safety\" reasons.</p> <p>Dame Yve Buckland, chair of the Consumer Council for Water, says: \"As a country we have put \u00a370bn into the water industry. Tap water in Britain is now of the very highest quality and we urge restaurants to offer tap water to customers for free. You shouldn't have to feel like a cheapskate because you ask for tap water.\"</p> <p>But can you force a restaurant to give you free tap water? The tales on CCW's website (<a href=\"http://www.ccwater.org.uk\">ccwater.org.uk</a>) reveal widespread confusion over consumer law. </p> <p>Some tell of heated arguments in restaurants where diners insist that restaurants are required by law to provide free tap water. One says that under a law passed in Gladstone's time to promote temperance, restaurants are obliged to provide free tap water.</p> <p>Some in the trade believe that they are required to serve free water. \"As a retired hotelier and restaurateur, I was always led to believe that, by law, an innkeeper cannot refuse a traveller free water even if they do not spend any money at the establishment,\" says one poster on <a href=\"http://www.ccwater.org.uk\">ccwater.org.uk</a>.</p> <p>But these assertions are pure hokum. The truth is that in Britain there is no legal requirement on restaurants to provide free tap water to customers. Some pubs and other premises permitted to sell alcohol may have a clause in their licence that does require them to offer free tap water, but it's on a localised basis only.</p> <p>Sue Penniston, spokeswoman for the Drinking Water Inspectorate, part of Defra, says: \"There are a lot of misconceptions, some of which arose out of the Leah Betts case. In the wake of her death, a lot of large premises had clauses put into their licensing agreements which obliged them to offer tap water free of charge.</p> <p>\"But apart from that restriction, restaurants do not have to give you water and do not have to supply it for free.\" She adds that it's nonsense for establishments to refuse tap water on health and safety grounds. \"If a restaurant is on the public mains supply, the water is potable and there is no reason for it not to be supplied on health and safety grounds.\"</p> <p>In the absence of legal compulsion, Buckland is encouraging good practice among restaurant chains. Pizza Hut has said it will always give customers free tap water. Strada, a pizza chain, already serves customers free chilled tap water in a designer bottle. \"Strada is pleased to provide tap water free of charge throughout its restaurants as part of standard service,\" a spokeswoman says.</p> <p>Restaurants and retailers are also facing intense pressure from green campaigners. Earlier this year, environment minister Phil Woolas condemned the bottled water industry as \"morally unacceptable\". Mineral water suppliers on average use two litres of water for every litre put into a bottle. Much is transported from overseas, from as far away as New Zealand and Fiji. Four out of five bottles are plastic, most of which end up in landfill despite recycling initiatives, where it can take four centuries to decompose.</p> <p>Consumer campaigners Which? estimate that the number of plastic bottles sent to landfill each year would fill Wembley Stadium twice over. Which? describes bottled mineral water as an unnecessary drink that costs us \u00a31.68bn a year. The good news is that sales fell by 9% last year, and in the credit crunch sales are expected to fall further. \"Our reasons for buying bottled water are drying up,\" according to Which?</p> <p>United Utilities, one of the biggest UK water companies, has begun a campaign called \"tap into water\" that brings free tap water to events such as football matches and street festivals. Philip Green, UU chief executive says: \"At a time when we are facing such huge environmental challenges, buying bottled water at the rate of 3bn bottles a year in the UK is clearly unsustainable. I hope the hospitality industry will recognise their customers are environmentally aware and offer them free tap water without prejudice.\"</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:p.collinson@theguardian.com\">p.collinson@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>In 1988, Lucian Freud had an exhibition at the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin. It was a great success, of course: the German art audience knew about Freud already, and were able to see his work against the background memory of the German realist art movement of the 1920s known as Neue Sachlichkeit, \"the new objectivity\". </p> <p>In fact, the pictures were so well liked that one of them was stolen. It was a tiny portrait, done in 1952 on a sheet of copper no bigger than a leaf of typing paper, of his friend and fellow painter Francis Bacon. It belonged to the Tate, but someone just took it from the wall in Berlin and walked off with it. </p> <p>Freud rang to tell me. It was shocking news. I had never known a friend's painting to be stolen, particularly not a picture that I thought of as an unequivocal masterpiece: that smooth, pallid pear of a face like a hand-grenade on the point of detonation, those evasive-looking eyes under their blade-like lids, had long struck me as one of the key images of modernity, though a dozen years ago practically no one in America, where the big reputations were meant to be made, had even heard of Lucian Freud.</p> <p>\"Well,\" I said to Freud, \"at least there's someone out there who's really fanatical about your work.\" \"Oh, d'you think so ?\" he replied. \"You know, I'm not sure I agree. I don't think whoever it was took it because he liked me. Not a bit of it. He must have been crazy about Francis. That would justify the risk.\" </p> <p>And as I chewed this over later, I came to think that Freud was quite possibly right. There was, after all, no way a thief could sell the little head. It was too well-known, an icon of English art, and so was its subject. I saw it in my mind's eye, hanging on a nail in some rented room in Berlin, with its thief adoring it: a Holy Card of homosexuality, which now would never be shared with anyone else, an object of unstinted obsession. Would it ever reappear? In that moment, I realised that it would probably not. \"Present whereabouts unknown,\" the captions in the art history books still say. </p> <p>A dozen or so years ago Bacon himself was still alive. He was extremely successful and, by the standards of the day, very rich. Millionaires scrambled for his work and endured long waiting lists at Marlborough Fine Art, his dealer. Today he is dead and his prices have not merely soared; they have gone nuts, and will undoubtedly get madder. Someone paid almost \u00a314m for Study for Head of George Dyer (painted in 1967) at Sotheby's in July. The effect of such prices is, unfortunately, to strike the public blind and abort discussion of the strengths as well as the weaknesses of Bacon's paintings. So it will be interesting to see what the public reaction (other than the oohing and ahing crowds of curiosity-chasers, which are guaranteed to be enormous) will be to his fifth retrospective, which opens at the Tate on September 11. </p> <p>Here is England's most celebrated recently dead painter. He is probably the best-known one, and possibly the most popular, since JMW Turner. But Turner painted things the English love: landscape, grand and tender effects of weather and light, images of mountains and the sea which are saturated with primordial, romantic power. He couldn't draw a portrait or paint a figure that didn't look like a worm or a spindle, but that had no effect on his reputation. Whereas Bacon's main subject and primal obsession is the human figure, radically reshaped and engaged in an activity that, before 1969, was punishable in England - and quite often was punished - by criminal prosecution, social obloquy and jail. A small step for a man, but a giant leap for (consenting, adult) mankind. This painter of buggery, sadism, dread and death-vomit has emerged as the toughest, the most implacable, lyric artist in late 20th-century England, perhaps in all the world. </p> <p>Such a denouement would hardly have been expected by John Ruskin, greatest of English art writers. But then you might say that, within the long scope of British art, Bacon is Ruskin's antitype: in his ferocious sexual frankness, of course, but most of all in his denial that human life has any \"higher purpose\", or that art and nature connect us in some way to God. He was the compleat atheist, anti-metaphysical, anti-transcendent. Birth, copulation, death, end of story. Some of his most memorable paintings bear titles such as Fragment of a Crucifixion. But you may be quite sure that, for Bacon, the figure on the cross is not a long-dead, rapturously remembered Jewish rebel named Jesus Christ, and that the ones next to it are not stand-ins for Joseph of Arimathea and the Virgin Mary. \"Some people,\" I remember him saying in an interview, \"think that my paintings are horrible. Horrible! But then you only need to think about the meat on your plate.\" </p> <p>Bacon has not only a horror of religion (never forget that he was born and raised in Ireland), but also an acute dislike of narrative painting. His purpose is not storytelling. It is sensation. \"Some paint comes across directly on to the nervous system, other paint tells you the story in a long diatribe through the brain.\" That distinction, between \"brain\" and \"nervous system\", thinking and feeling, was always of capital importance to him. It lies at the root of his lifelong denial that he was in any way an \"expressionist\"; to him, his paintings were realistic, rather intensely so. Like certain still lives by Goya, or like the more recent and no less extraordinary masterpiece of a skinned rabbit by Antonio L\u00f3pez Garc\u00eda, they make you think about the meat on your plate. </p> <p>The show at the Tate is by far the largest retrospective of his work. The first, in 1962, introduced him to an English public that hardly knew him beyond the small exhibitions he had held in the 50s at Erica Brausen's Hanover Gallery in London. The second, a big event in Paris in 1971, dramatically consolidated his reputation: at 62, Bacon was at the Grand Palais, in the city most associated with his sources - Picasso, Giacometti, aspects of surrealism - and hence set alongside the big boys of modernism, a comparison which, all the French press agreed, he survived with ease. (It is not true that the French have habitually condescended to British art - one need think only of Delacroix's immense admiration for Constable to remember that.) The show was also given a fillip of tabloid sensation by Bacon's lover, George Dyer, who killed himself in their grand hotel suite on the night of the opening - a suicide commemorated a couple of years later in the right-hand panel of a triptych featuring a collapsing figure dying on a toilet seat.</p> <p>The latest show will travel widely, first to the Prado in 2009 - a proper venue, since that museum is the home of so many of the artists Bacon admired most, from Zurbar\u00e1n to Vel\u00e1zquez, and of course Goya. Later it goes to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, where it will end in the summer of 2009. It is very intelligently curated by Matthew Gale of Tate Modern and Chris Stephens of Tate Britain. They have done an exemplary job, and their catalogue becomes the standard text on Bacon.</p> <p>Since Bacon died in 1992, and went out on a high note of fame, is there enough new material to justify another retrospective? Emphatically, yes. New to whom? To the new generation of art lovers which has arisen in the past 25 years, and which inevitably has questions about Bacon different from the ones asked by the previous generation. They are prompted by biographical urges which, because they bear so directly on the meaning of the work, are more important than mere curiosity about a much-sensationalised homosexual life. This one is the summing-up; it is also the most revealing, because it takes you further into the sources of the art than its predecessors did or could.</p> <p>Why? Because of the sorting out of the famously filthy mess that was Bacon's studio at Reece Mews - the piles and sticky avalanches of photos, books, clipped newsprint, booze-stained scribbles on the verge of becoming drawings, squished paint tubes and every imaginable ingredient of clutter that covered the horizontal and vertical surfaces, tables and walls, like some illegible compost in which, like moulds or somewhat alien life-forms, his future pictures were brewing and his past ones decaying. This stuff was more than rubbish. It was an archive, admittedly a staggeringly disordered one. And fortunately, instead of throwing all this crap out, Bacon's heir, John Edwards, saw to it that it was all collected and given to the Hugh Lane Gallery in Dublin. At first one greeted this news with scepticism: wasn't it some kind of joke, the artist so famous that even his shit is adored having years of excreta preserved in one of the principal museums of his native country? But no. The rubbish was a precious archaeological record. This becomes clear when you read the Tate catalogue, whose authors delve often brilliantly and always inquisitively into its resources. Of these, the chief is photography.</p> <p>There is scarcely an important western artist of the past hundred years around whom a book could not be spun, and a show constructed, with the title \"Fred X and Photography\". Perhaps one or two, such as Mondrian. Even Pierre Bonnard, once thought of as a rapturous apostle of the unmediated eye, used snapshots. But Bacon's resort to photography, both still and cinematic, was constant, obsessive and over-the-top. Its sources and results have an enormous span, from the relatively familiar - Dr Goebbels orating, terrified crowds scattering from the tsar's police, or the bloody face of the nurse on Eisenstein's Odessa Steps, peering hysterically through her broken spectacles - to the utterly obscure. There are bits of Picture Post and images from those resources of gay porn, the body-culture magazines of the 50s. Sometimes the obscure details lie within images themselves famous. For instance, there is a well-known photograph of a racing-car at Le Mans, in which the speed of the machine and the panning camera movement turn the wheels into forward-leaning ellipses, distorted cartoonwise. So striking is this effect and so dominant the machine's image that few people so much as notice the figures in the background, on the verge of the track. But Bacon did, and he stole a pair of them, enlarging them for the right panel of Crucifixion (1965), where, in their odd soft hats, they look threateningly like a pair of Australian yobs leaning on a bar. </p> <p>There are also photographs that Bacon's paintings made famous, but few except insiders knew about before Bacon swiped them. Obvious examples are the images from Eadweard Muybridge's Animal Locomotion of the 1880s, albums of sequential shots of human and animal movement - wrestlers, a trotting dog, or the haunting \"paralytic child walking on all fours\". Muybridge is such a classic figure in the history of photography now that it's hard to imagine a time when his work wasn't recognisable, but that was the time when Bacon came in. Analogous to these are some of the extraordinary images in KC Clark's Positioning in Radiography, a medical album published in 1939, in which the bodies of hospital patients are twisted and spraddled to display their tumours and other malformations to the searching gaze of the x-ray lens, calling to mind the words of Bacon's favourite modernist poet, TS Eliot: \"The wounded surgeon plies the steel / That questions the distempered part\". All this was grist to Bacon's mill. It enabled him to find new configurations in the body that were not the result of \"artist's licence\", not formal distortions gained from invention, but real, actual and corporeal. They had something to do with the traumatised flesh of accident victims, and something to do with the froggy postures of sex, but fully partook of the nature of neither. </p> <p>Along with this estranged realism went a fascinated dread of authority. It was never a secret that Bacon's own relation with his parents was fiercely distorted. His father, an Irish horse-trainer, seems to have hated his peculiar pervert of a son (as well as instilled in him a lifelong fascination with gambling at the track) and their relationship was distant and hostile. Such was the context of Bacon's most famous paintings, the Popes, for - especially to an Irishman of Bacon's generation - the Pope, not the king or any prime minister or even a dictator's chief of police, is the ultimate authority figure. Bacon's Pope was not just any Pope. He was not the one reigning at the time Bacon did his pictures, Eugenio Pacelli, who took the throne as Pius XII in 1939. He had been dead for almost 300 years. He was Innocent X Pamphili, the formidable and extraordinarily cunning man who, as a sworn enemy of Protestant England, sent support to the insurgent Irish during the civil war; the man who employed Gianlorenzo Bernini as his official sculptor, and supervised the creation of the most theatrically beautiful square in Europe, Piazza Navona, with its ever-astounding Fountain of the Four Rivers. </p> <p>Vel\u00e1zquez, while visiting Rome, was commissioned to paint Innocent's likeness, and the result was one of the half-dozen greatest portraits of human power in the world. Bacon always swore that he had never seen this portrait, only black-and-white reproductions of it. This may or may not be true. I can only attest that, when I first saw Vel\u00e1zquez's painting of Innocent X in 1959, I thought it was a Bacon. It hung surrounded by red brocade wallpaper in a tiny alcove; it was glazed; and it was reflected as a distorted image in the uneven, rippled glass of the alcove's open, 18th-century doors. It only took a moment to realise what I was looking at, but the first impression was indelible and I still wonder if Bacon might not have seen that reflection and registered it. Possibly. Probably not. No matter. What does matter is the extraordinary psychic power of the Pope's silent scream. It gains, somehow, from the fact that Innocent X, unquestionably one of the most confident men that ever lived, was the least likely to scream, even when alone. Of course, none of Bacon's Popes compares with the fascinating, detailed power of truth in Vel\u00e1zquez's original: what could? But once you have seen two or three of Bacon's screaming Popes, you can't get them out of your mind. They are subversive in a way that surrealism, most of the time, could only dream of.</p> <p>There are good Bacons, sublime and terrifying ones, and a few failures. He must have been one of the most self-critical artists of the 20th century, a ruthless destroyer of his own work. Beyond a certain point he could not rework an image: it had to be scrapped. To hang on to it would have blurred and fouled up the \"look\" he prized, which was not highly finished - his way of painting on the wrong side of the canvas precluded finish - but, by the standards of \"beautiful painting\", disagreeably scrubby. But then, he did so admire and envy the old masters, and he paid a peculiar sort of tribute to them in the way he chose to frame and present his paintings, behind enormous sheets of glass (so that one had the fleeting impression of glimpsing something rather alarming, but involuntarily, as through a window) and surrounded by broad, thick, glittering, gilded mouldings, so polished and bright as to negate the idea of touch. The frame and its contents do not quite cancel one another out, but they imply cancellation. Which, together with the anguish of the body's transgressive pleasures, is only another of Bacon's paradoxes.</p>",

  "<p>Can you come up with a tastier, more satisfying, more consensual dish than calamari fritti? Forget it. It's impossible. I believe that deep inside this dish is everybody's ideal, that nothing comes closer, that all of humanity's one and only desert island dish would be deep-fried squid with a wedge of lemon on the side. This is the definition of effortless, comforting, delightful eating.</p> <p>OK, maybe I am getting slightly carried away. There is probably the odd person on this planet who likes some other peculiar dish more, maybe a grilled lamb chop or a chocolate fudge cake. The deep-frying may also deter some.</p> <p>Still, this is definitely one of my favourites, a live memory of beach holidays around the Mediterranean, and I had to make sure I use my short break from the vegetarian corner to share with readers my love affair with squid in general, and with fried squid in particular.</p> <p>I urge you not to be deterred by novelty. Preparing and cooking squid is easier than most fish. The only thing to remember is not to cook it for too long. If grilling, the pan must be extra-hot so the squid cooks in only a minute or two. Otherwise, it goes tough.</p> <p>Cleaning and preparing fresh squid isn't a complicated task, either, even if you've not done it before. The River Cottage Fish Book, co-written by the usual occupier of these pages, gives a detailed, illustrated explanation for first-timers. Or just get the fishmonger to do it for you.</p> <p>The preparation of the squid will depend on their size. Very small ones can be eaten whole, though you'd still have to remove the tentacles and head bit, then pull away and discard the eyes, beak and anything that feels hard, sharp or slimy, leaving only the tentacles and body for cooking. Wash them and pat dry with a paper towel.</p> <p>With medium-sized and large squid, you'd also need to remove the tentacles, as above, but you'd also pull away and discard the wings. Turn the squid inside out and wash well, removing any guts or quill.</p> <p>Keep the squid as it is, or cut it into rings, about 1cm wide. Alternatively, \"butterfly\" it - use a sharp knife to make a long cut from top to bottom. Open up the squid, with the inside facing you, and then use a knife very (!) gently to score the skin in parallel lines, about 1cm apart, taking great care you don't cut right through the skin. Turn the squid 30 degrees, and repeat with another set of cuts, to get a diamond-shaped cross-hatch pattern. Finally, cut the squid into roughly 5cm square pieces, pat dry and it's ready to cook.</p> <h2>Calamari fritti with cucumber salad</h2> <p>My version of the famous dish. Dip the calamari in the light tempura batter at the last moment, just before frying. You don't have to make the salad - a lime or lemon wedge is fine - but it does make the dish more special.</p> <p>Makes four starter portions.</p> <p><strong>80g self-raising flour</strong><br><strong>80g cornflour, plus a little extra</strong><br><strong>210ml soda water</strong><br><strong>2 tsp rapeseed oil</strong><br><strong>\u00bd tsp dried chilli flakes</strong><br><strong>Coarse sea salt</strong><br><strong>350g cleaned squid rings</strong><br><strong>Vegetable oil, for frying (grape-seed or sunflower are good)</strong><br>For the cucumber salad<br><strong>4 mini cucumbers (200g in total)</strong><br><strong>\u00bc medium red onion, peeled and very thinly sliced</strong><br><strong>2 tbsp groundnut oil</strong><br><strong>2\u00bd tbsp lime juice</strong><br><strong>\u00be tsp palm sugar</strong><br><strong>Coarse sea salt</strong><br><strong>\u00bd fresh chilli, finely chopped</strong><br><strong>2 tbsp roughly chopped mint</strong><br><strong>2 tbsp roughly chopped coriander</strong></p> <p>Start with the salad, because the flavours will intensify if it's left to sit for a little while. Use a vegetable peeler or mandolin to shave the unpeeled cucumbers into long, thin strips, and place these in a mixing bowl. Add the sliced onion. Whisk together the oil, lime juice, palm sugar and salt. Pour over the cucumber and onion, then add the chilli and herbs. Toss gently with your hands, taste and adjust the seasoning - this salad needs quite a lot of salt. Pile up in a nice serving bowl, ready for the hot squid.</p> <p>In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, cornflour, soda water, rapeseed oil, chilli and a pinch of salt - the batter should be smooth and thinner than a pancake mix, but not watery.</p> <p>Scatter some more cornflour over a plate, to 'dry' the squid. In a medium saucepan, heat up enough frying oil to come at least 4cm up the pan. When the oil is piping hot, take a few pieces of squid, toss them lightly in the cornflour plate, and shake off any excess. Dip them in the batter, shake off any excess and carefully drop them into the hot oil. Take care not to fill the pan too much, or the squid pieces will stick to each other and stew rather than deep-fry, and turn them over in the bubbling oil with a slotted spoon. Once they have taken on a little bit of colour - after around one to two minutes' cooking - carefully lift the calamari on to a colander and sprinkle with salt. Remove any loose bits of batter from the oil, then repeat with another batch of squid.</p> <p>Assuming you haven't eaten all of the cooked squid while you've been cooking the rest, pile the warm calamari on a serving plate or bowl, and serve with the cucumber salad.</p> <h2>Char-grilled squid with chana dal and preserved lemon</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337076229\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/08/29/ColinCampbell1111.jpg\" alt=\"Food feature - USE ONLY WITH ORIGINAL ARTICLE\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Chana dal are skinless dried split chickpeas used in Indian cooking. They have a great texture and delicate flavour. Fine alternatives are yellow split peas, moong dal and most lentils. Adjust the cooking times according to the instructions on the packet. Serves four.</p> <p><strong>6 large red peppers</strong><br><strong>210g chana dal, washed and soaked in cold water for 30 minutes</strong><br><strong>3 tbsp finely chopped preserved lemon skin</strong><br><strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong><br><strong>3 tbsp harissa paste</strong><br><strong>4 tbsp roughly chopped parsley</strong><br><strong>4 tbsp roughly chopped coriander, plus extra to garnish</strong><br><strong>2 tsp coriander seeds, toasted and crushed with a pestle and mortar</strong><br><strong>Coarse sea salt</strong><br><strong>600g cleaned squid, butterflied and cut into 5cm-square pieces </strong></p> <p>Use a small, sharp knife to cut around the stalk of each pepper and lift it out with the seeds attached. Put the peppers on an oven tray, place underneath a very hot grill, as close to the heat as you can get it, and roast, turning every now and then, until they are black on the outside - this should take 25-30 minutes. When ready, remove, cover the tray with foil and leave to cool down slightly. Once you can handle the peppers, remove and discard the blackened skin, then let the peppers cool down further in a bowl, then tear into 3cm wide slices.</p> <p>Meanwhile, drain the chana dal from their soaking water, transfer to a medium saucepan, cover with plenty of cold water and bring to a simmer. After about 25 minutes, they should be ready, but check they are tender before draining. Wash under cold water and leave to dry.</p> <p>When you are ready to assemble the dish, place the dal in a medium nonstick pan together with the pepper slices, some of the pepper juices that will have exuded out into the bowl, the preserved lemon, half the oil, a third of the harissa, the parsley and the fresh and dry coriander. Toss gently over medium heat, just to warm up, making sure the peppers don't break down in the process. Taste and season generously with salt.</p> <p>Meanwhile, place a ridged griddle pan on the stove top and leave it on maximum heat for about five minutes - it needs to get burning hot. (You can also do this on a barbecue.) Toss the squid with half the olive oil, the remaining harissa and a bit of salt. Spread the squid tentacles and pieces, cut side facing up, in the hot pan and cook quickly to get some grilling marks on one side before turning over. The process shouldn't take more than a minute or two. You will probably need to cook the squid in a few batches, depending on the size of your pan. Just make sure the pieces are spaced well apart.</p> <p>To serve, pile up the dal mix, alternating with the squid pieces, and top the stack with the squid tentacles. Finish off with a trickle of oil and some more chopped coriander.</p> <h2>Squid with sweet potato and lemon salsa</h2> <p>A fine summery main course that is best served warm with crusty bread. That said, I once tried it cold, and it was also impeccable. The anchovies, if you can't stand them, aren't essential. Serves four.</p> <p><strong>500g (net weight) sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1cm dice</strong><br><strong>2 small lemons</strong><br><strong>150g trimmed celery, cut into 1cm dice</strong><br><strong>1\u00bd tbsp pitted Kalamata olives, cut into quarters lengthways</strong><br><strong>2\u00bd tbsp capers</strong><br><strong>3 garlic cloves, crushed</strong><br><strong>6 anchovy fillets, roughly chopped</strong><br><strong>6 tbsp chopped parsley</strong><br><strong>2\u00bd tsp maple syrup</strong><br><strong>5 tbsp olive oil</strong><br><strong>\u00be tsp salt</strong><br><strong>Freshly ground black pepper</strong><br><strong>800g cleaned squid, cut into rings, or butterflied and cut into pieces</strong><br><strong>60g rocket</strong><br><strong>Chilli oil, to finish</strong></p> <p>Place a medium-sized pan of salted water on your stove top and bring to a boil. Once boiling, add the sweet potato, simmer for five to seven minutes, then test for doneness - they need to be tender but still retain their shape, so watch out that they don't turn into mush. Drain into a colander and leave to cool down.</p> <p>Next, take the lemons and, with a small, sharp knife, trim off their tops and tails. Now cut down their sides, along their round curves, to remove the skin and white pith. Over a medium bowl - to collect any juice that escapes - remove the individual lemon segments by cutting between the membranes. Put the segments in the bowl, then squeeze any remaining juice from the desegmented lemons over the top. </p> <p>Add the cooked sweet potatoes to the lemon bowl, then gently stir in the celery, olives, capers, garlic, anchovy (if using), parsley, maple syrup, three tablespoons of olive oil, salt and pepper. The salsa can now be left at room temperature for a couple of hours, or refrigerated and used the next day.</p> <p>To cook the squid, heat up a ridged griddle pan or a barbecue until really hot - again, this is an essential factor in the cooking process. Throw the squid pieces in the pan a few at a time, without crowding, grill for about one minute each side, then remove, and repeat with the remaining squid. </p> <p>Once all the squid is cooked, toss it gently into the salsa ingredients. The heat of the squid will turn this into a warmish salad.</p> <p>As you plate it, dot with the rocket and finish with a trickle of chilli oil. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ottolenghi: The Cookbook is published by Ebury Press at \u00a325.

  "<h2>The winner</h2> <p>Ros puts her hand over the receiver. \"She says she's not sure whether they take mums.\" Ros and I exchange quizzical looks. </p> <p>The woman from the campsite is back on the line. \"Sorry about that,\" she tells Ros, \"it's groups and gazebos we don't take. It's just that we have had trouble with mums before - we find that they sit around drinking coffee while their kids run wild.\" </p> <p>\"But isn't that the whole point?\" I say. Anyway, Ros secures the booking and we get on with our packing. We arrive and I smuggle my gazebo in, disguised as a play tent.</p> <p>Cartmel Caravan and Camping Park, perfectly manicured, in full bloom and boasting its very own microclimate, is an idyll in the lesser spotted southern Lake District. And the loos are clean.</p> <p>We pitch our tents and get the kettle on - did I make that sound too easy? - and the kids run wild. Actually, after a few excited laps of the field they decide to put on a talent show and begin practising. Over coffee we read the campsite rules. Organised games are not permitted and children must be kept under control at all times. We tell the kids to be less organised. They don't get it. We are definitely in control.</p> <p>Cartmel is not only famous for its splendid 12th-century priory and its racecourse, but is also home to the Sticky Toffee Pudding Co, one of Rick Stein's food heroes. We make this a priority excursion.</p> <p>The stroll into Cartmel is more than pleasant, with opportunities to play poohsticks on the bridge (built 1829), nip into the gallery to buy something to hang on your wall/neck, and for light refreshment in the heavily beamed Royal Oak. The village store turns out to be a gastronomic delight and we emerge with more than just sticky toffee pudding. The dads are arriving at the weekend - they are our excuse.</p> <p>Back to camp for coffee. The children want to play \"Harry Potter\" and ask if they can go into the wood to collect wands. We discuss wet day plans: steam train to the Lakeside aquarium; Holker Hall, with motor museum (optional extra) and lunch opportunity; a steam train to Lakeside, from Hatherthwaite, this time with steamer boat trip on to Bowness; if it keeps raining, I don't think the Beatrix Potter centre is too far away. The kids are now shouting wildly as cows are blocking their escape route.</p> <p>The kids return. They want me to be Professor McGonnigal. I'd prefer to do Defence against the Dark Arts but decide not to say anything. </p> <p>Dry day plans include ... well, it's so lovely here that I reckon there's a lot to be said for just sitting around in a field all day drinking coffee while the kids flourish in their new-found freedom. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Cartmel Caravan and Camping Park (01539 536270). </p> <p><strong>Melanie Horton</strong> has won two return flights to New York with STA Travel.</p> <h2>Keeping up appearances<br>Costa del Azahar, Spain</h2> <p>The first thing you notice about Camping Tropicana on the Costa del Azahar, before you get to grips with the nipple fountains and caged spider monkeys, is the extraordinary sense of order. The staff are all multilingual and flit from Spanish to French to English to German to Dutch, which can be a little tricky if you just want a token for the tumble drier. They also like rules: </p> <p>Rule 1. Stop and step away from the vehicle!</p> <p>(We have of course already stopped and are now studying a laminated site map and rule book.)</p> <p>Rule 2.

If there are no free yellow, green or blue zones please select from a white zone (unless marked with a blue flag) in which case we are full!</p> <p>(Right ...)</p> <p>For us, Camping Tropicana is a pit-stop en route to Barcelona. For others it's an open air Ideal Home Exhibition. We are surrounded by elderly Dutch couples in caravans. Many, perhaps unaware that campsites tend to come with their own built-in floor, are busy laying linoleum. It seems tomorrow they are handing out rosettes for best turned-out pitch, with special awards for awning erection, tableware and light dusting beyond the call of duty. Competition's fierce: fridges to be hooked up, satellite dishes aligned, pot plants potashed, candelabras buffed. </p> <p>A priapic plaster of Paris Bacchus in the shower block notwithstanding, evenings are uneventful at Camping Playa Tropicana. At 8pm everyone retires inside to watch satellite TV and charge their mobiles. We too abandon the night time's meagre offerings to dust down our thermarests and prune the basil plant. I'm holding out for best newcomer on a limited budget. My wife feels the judges won't look kindly on open air pant drying.

We were enjoying a romantic beachfront dinner at the Season restaurant, when it slipped out: \"Let's go camping!\" I nearly choked on my pan-fried snapper. \"Trust me, you'll love it,\" he added. </p> <p>He said the same thing before he bought an Xbox. I ordered another bottle of Tasmanian pinot noir and changed the subject.</p> <p>The next day, with my Jimmy Choos protruding from my rucksack, we were on a Greyhound bus to Hervey Bay, launch pad of most excursions to Fraser Island. </p> <p>We opted for a three-day unguided group safari with Koala Adventures. In essence, we'd chosen to spend the next few days sharing camping equipment, food rations, and a four-wheel drive with a group of strangers.</p> <p>I nearly pulled out when we were shown the pre-trip safety video, which included tips on the quickest way to manoeuvre a jeep from a sand dune, what to do when confronted by a hungry wild dingo, and the crunch - the best way to dig a toilet in the sand. In the space of a day, I'd gone from private en suite to DIY toilet facilities. </p> <p>The Butchulla people - Fraser's original inhabitants - call the island K'gari, meaning paradise. It didn't take long to fathom why. We sped across empty beaches, swam in lakes and explored rainforests. At night we cooked and made merry beneath the stars. But what made the trip so special was our five fellow campers - a smorgasbord of nationalities, ages and characters. By the end of the trip we were like one big family, except we were happy and didn't want to part.</p> <p>After three days I was ready to leave. There's only so much dunny-digging a Sheila can take. At least my stilettos came in handy. <br><strong>Sarah Charsley, Brighton</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Koala Adventures (+61 7 4946 6446, <a href=\"http://www.koalaadventures.com\">koalaadventures.com</a>). </p> <h2>The other lake district<br>Uganda</h2> <p>Four hours west of Kampala is a small town called Fort Portal. The Bunyuruguru crater lake district is a half-hour drive away, on the back of a motorbike, by pick-up truck or squashed with 26 other people into a minibus that seats 12. </p> <p>Our first stop was Lake Nyabikere, where the CVK Hostel offers campsites or bandas (small roofed huts) with beds and mosquito nets from about \u00a33. The water is safe and refreshing to swim in, the bird life astoundingly varied and the weather hot but not oppressively so. You can hire a canoe to explore the lake itself, or hike through the hills on various walks with or without a guide.</p> <p>Lake Nkuruba is surrounded by tall trees. In an area with the highest primate density in the world, trees mean monkeys, lots of them. The babies swing from their mothers and look inquisitively at you from a few metres away. This theatre of nature is made all the sweeter by the knowledge that a few miles south people are being flown in to the national parks to pester the highly endangered mountain gorillas, for $500 an hour.</p> <p>The Bunyuruguru lake district is genuinely idyllic. Word is getting out though, leading to a proliferation of hotels although not yet visitors, so being the only guests in B&amp;Bs built for 60 people is a common and marvellous experience.<br><strong>Josh Heller, Sheffield</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>CVK Hostel (+256 7724 92274) </p> <h2>An American road trip<br>Rocky Mountain National Park</h2> <p>We've been road tripping for 10 days: living off restaurant gift-cards, free coffee and cool-box cream cheese. West from Kansas we headed straight to Vegas, dressed our best and drank dollar margaritas from plastic cups. Tonight, though, we push through dusk on cruise control and pitch our tent at Moraine Park campsite.</p> <p>Morning, and we're woken by the whir of generators and the low hum of breakfast. There's a friendly distance between campers, a quiet camaraderie born of bear fear and the short-term pleasure of communal living. When an old guy arrives with a truck full of wood and ice, we get in line and buy. </p> <p>In the afternoon it will rain so we jump into the car and make for the highest road. Everywhere signs plead that we stick to the path: \"Keep off the tundra!\" We canter higher, cameras in hand, gasping in the oxygen-lite air. Below us elk clump together. Black storms, hot from Kansas, stripe the horizon and threaten lightning. A ranger urges caution, but up here, where the trees grow sideways beside benevolent rocks, we believe ourselves untouchable and protected. </p> <p>In the evening we entertain ourselves by building a fire on our allotted grill. We bake potatoes and Olathe corn in foil, eat yellow mustard with our sausages and drop rum into our coke. Past 10pm a father and his son smoke cigars into the night; parents sleep soundly by their kids and we, drinking together, survey the bigness of the sky. <br><strong>Catherine Carter, London</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Moraine Park Campsite (<a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/romo/planyourvisit/camping.htm\">nps.gov/romo/planyourvisit/camping.htm</a>).</p> <h2>3,700 sq km to ourselves <br>Tanzania</h2> <p>An invitation from your 81-year-old mother-in law to go camping in the remote African bush might not be the ideal basis for a relaxing summer holiday. But Katherine is determined to make a special family visit to the malaria research station in rural Tanzania she ran with her late husband, Chris, in the 1950s. Tribes Travel is organising her trip and recommends staying at Babu's camp, in the Mkomazi game reserve in eastern Tanzania. </p> <p>The visitors' book at the main gate reveals that our party of eight are the only visitors in the entire reserve of 3,700 sq km. There are no signposts and little else to distract you from the rusty-red dust tracks, straw-coloured bush with green tufts of acacia and baobab trees, the purple-black Pare Mountains and the big skies.</p> <p>A walking safari in the intense equatorial heat with the camp manager, Seif, is fascinating. Animal tracks and droppings provide clues to the presence of giraffe, dik-dik and impala. There are 450 recorded species of birds in this area and, unlike in the bigger national parks, the larger animals are more reticent about performing for tourist cameras. We find an exquisite river frog in our loo, a hornbill calls at us from a nearby yellow-barked acacia tree, a giant brown moth sleeps in an empty whisky glass. </p> <p>Babu's is sensitive to its environment but retains an atmosphere of safari elegance. Pre-dinner drinks are selected from a temporary bar at the foot of a giant baobab tree and taken around a crackling campfire. Dinner itself is superb, particularly as there is no evidence of a kitchen or a chef. </p> <p>As Katherine recounts tales of taking blood samples from Masai warriors, we begin to get a feel for what it might have been like for her and Chris, more than 50 years ago, working in isolation in such a beautiful but forbidding wilderness.<br><strong>Stuart Heaver, Whitstable, Kent</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Tribes Travel (01728 685 971, <a href=\"http://www.tribes.co.uk\">tribes.co.uk</a>).

That is the best thing about being a literature student. Despite bucketfuls of debt, our holiday plans can still be decided by a well-turned phrase. For me that phrase told of \"chicory-fragrant caf\u00e9 au lait\", sipped slowly by the sea meadows of France's Midi. I called my friend Dylan. \"We have to go to the south of France. I'm reading a book and it says there are women there with serene dark faces and smooth skin as sleek as seals.\" </p> <p>\"I'm not camping in France. I was 10 last time and the discos made me cry,\" he replied. \"No discos, I promise.\"</p> <p>Dylan's second clause was that we encounter mountains along the way, so we devised a route that would begin in Aquitaine, arcing through the Pyrenees and ending along the Canal du Midi in the Mediterranean fishing port of Agde. Flying into Bordeaux, we rented a car and drove south, the roads plunging us deep into the Gascogne regional park then taking us to the coastal village of Messanges, 70km north of Biarritz. </p> <p>We raised our tent that evening amid the sticky pines of the Landes forest, in a little disco-free campsite attached to the farm Chez Cazou. Our first night's sleep came easily after two flagons of Madame Cazou's ros\u00e9 wine. Days were spent wheeling blissfully through shady woods and grilling fat sardines on empty swaths of silver beach. </p> <p>From there, we wove our way south and into the heart-stopping crooks of the Pyrenees, arriving at our next campsite, Les Tilleuls, just outside the mountain village of G\u00e8dre. The surrounding views of the Campbiehl and Cirque de Galvanie were celestial. </p> <p>On we travelled, via the pink city of Toulouse, towards Agde. Stopping outside the local boatyard at Camping Periniere, we bought food at the market. A wondrous end to a holiday, until we decided one evening to take a swim at the naturist resort of Cap d'Agde. \"Come on, we've hiked the Pyrenees, this will be easy,\" I said, suddenly noticing the advanced age of our fellow bathers. \"Sleek as seals you said ... \" cried Dylan, drowned out by the disco behind us.<br><strong>Leo Wallace, York</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Chez Cazou (+33 5 58 48 50 47); Les Tilleuls (+ 33 5.62.92.48.92 ).</p> <h2>Rain won't stop play <br>New Forest, Hampshire</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337083101\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/08/29/Camping2.jpg\" alt=\"Barbecuing in the New Forest rain\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Another British summer... barbecuing in the New Forest rain</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alison Miller</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We are smart campers.

Two canny adults and five teenagers in a van, we nod our heads wisely and tap the sides of our noses at holiday traffic heading north.</p> <p>We are pitching our tent in Hollands Wood, a Forestry Commission site near Brockenhurst. It is raining unremitting sheets. I can see a stripy windbreak close by, behind which stands a man with a can of Strongbow and behind him is the Taj Mahal of all dome tents. Strongbow man is getting comfortable for our tent-raising entertainment. No one takes charge as we manically bend and pop the springy tent poles.</p> <p>We are awake under the dome and listening to the rain. It sounds like a riff: soft notes of wind through leaves, staccato pricks of rain, thudding crescendo, gradually quieter. </p> <p>On day two we hire bikes in Brockenhurst. The teenagers have reluctantly pulled on an assortment of waterproof gear, the smallest boys wearing man-size waterproof trousers that make their legs look short and pedalling tricky. On the forest trails we switch between easy inclines to free-wheeling downhill. There are tunnels of oaks, ash and beech. When the sky turns grey it contrasts with the lush, vibrant green all around us. </p> <p>Put this shade of green in a paint pot and you could call it August green or English green. But we are soaking wet and a bit miserable so there are other words to describe it.<br><strong>Alison Miller, Bury St Edmunds </strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Hollands Wood Caravanning and Camp Site (01590-622967). </p> <h2>And the dog came too<br>Lizard peninsula, Cornwall</h2> <p>\"He doesn't look the sort of chap to go camping,\" observed my friend Maureen after a two-hour acquaintance with my newish partner, Phil. However, it was sunny and the Lizard Peninsula beckoned. Rolo could come too, camping being a canine-friendly option.</p> <p>I collected together tent, camping kitchen, air bed, pegs etc. Phil arrived with some very fine wines and a large quantity of paper napkins. And golf clubs. I remembered the whisky, matches and washing up bowl ... but omitted to bring wellies. </p> <p>We arrived at our campsite to be met by the cheerful owner who asked if I would like him to buy me some wellies in Redruth. I laughingly dismissed this kindness and asked for directions by foot to Kennack Sands. </p> <p>We had yet to make camp and I had a large tent and a rather large novice camper on my hands. However, Phil soon became childishly excited and tackled tent pegs and guide ropes with enthusiasm. The bed was inflated, table and chairs set out, tea made - and the monsoon commenced.</p> <p>We discovered the sanctuary of the Cadgwith Cove Inn and a magnificent fish stew washed down with Doom Bar bitter. The next morning Rolo and I set off to explore Ruan Minor, a hamlet of 25 houses, not to be confused with the metropolis of Ruan Major (50 houses). </p> <p>Cornwall did not disappoint - we were fortified by Annie's pasties and Gear Farm pizzas. A day of sunshine enabled Rolo and me to walk along the coastal footpath from the Lizard to Coverack, a distance of 11 miles. Phil covered a similar distance on Mullion golf course. And we celebrated our last night in gale-lashed Kernow with a sumptious feast cooked by Phil, on a gas burner, inside the tent, washed down with some of that rather fine wine. <br><strong>Hazel North, Portland, Dorset</strong></p> <h2>Mini-camping <br>Holland</h2> <p>Mini-camping is the perfect holiday for those who seek peace and relaxation rather than mass entertainment and structured activity. These small sites are usually on farms (boerderijcamping) or in large private gardens. </p> <p>At Op den Diesdonk near Eindhoven we camped at a small farm in flat, traffic-free cycling country. Cycle paths criss-cross through fields of maize, along well signposted networks. De Groote Peel national park is nearby. There was a playground for children, trampolines, and a field of ponies and horses next to the camp. </p> <p>Further north and east near the lovely market town of Oldenzaal we camped at Erve Molman mini-camp. The Scoholten family live in a gleaming new farmhouse and offer the old farmhouse as a sitting and dining room for campers.

  "<p>The Picture of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde's eerie fable of the decadent young man whose portrait ages while he retains his youth, has inspired many works of fiction and performance, the latest being Matthew Bourne's dance drama, with Dorian updated to a superstar of modern billboard photography, an idol in blue jeans.</p> <p>Dorian Gray was clearly based on a living person, a member of Wilde's literary homosexual circle in the early 1890s when the story was first published. If Wilde's fiction is strange, the real life story of John Gray, Dorian's original, is even more bizarre. A young working-class poet of extraordinary beauty corrupts and is corrupted, in a lightning flash of conscience sees the error of his ways, travels to Rome to study for the priesthood, and ends his days a revered canon of the Roman Catholic church in Edinburgh. As an esoteric tale of sin and retribution, this is Oscar Wilde outdone.</p> <p>In Wilde's story, the boy Dorian is a \"young Adonis\" who looks as if he were made of \"ivory and rose leaves\". The description tallies with a contemporary photograph taken of John Gray standing in a garden wearing an immaculate white suit, white shoes and boater, meaningfully shooting an arrow from a bow. It is a reminder of how wrong it was to cast the saturnine Ioan Gruffudd as John Gray in the Stephen Fry movie Wilde: the real Gray was much blonder and more exquisite. He always appeared more youthful than he was. At 25 he could pass for a 15-year-old. Even as a venerable canon, he still looked like a large baby, soft-skinned and unlined.</p> <p>Wilde almost certainly first met him towards the end of 1889 at the house of the artists and designers Charles Ricketts (\"Orchid\") and Charles Shannon (\"Marigold\"), No 1 The Vale, Chelsea. Gray had already travelled a long way from his background in Bethnal Green, where his father was a carpenter and wheelwright. He had left school at 13 and become an apprentice metal-turner at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich. Relentlessly upwardly mobile, he then entered the civil service as a clerk and was finally ensconced in the Foreign Office Library. By 1889, Gray was well in with the aesthetes and had contributed an article on the Goncourt brothers and a fairy story about a magic dragon to Ricketts and Shannon's journal, the Dial.</p> <p>Wilde's biographer Richard Ellmann sees the naming of his story The Picture of Dorian Gray as \"a form of courtship\". The Christian name, as would have been obvious in sophisticated circles, refers to the ancient Greek tribe, the Dorians, proselytes for the culture of paiderastia, sexual love between men. Gray was blatantly the surname of Wilde's own latest passion, like Dorian a \"veritable Narcissus\" - a boy so striking that strangers would lean out of their boxes at Covent Garden to fix him in their opera glasses.</p> <p>People in Wilde's own entourage started referring to young Gray as \"Dorian\". Ernest Dowson, for example, describes a gathering of Rhymers at which \"Dorian\" Gray reads \"some very beautiful &amp; obscure versicles in the latest manner of French Symbolism\". Gray himself colluded, signing at least one of his letters to Wilde \"Dorian\", and seeming to enjoy his assumption of the role.</p> <p>But then, by February 1892, Gray began denying the association. He started proceedings for libel against the Star newspaper for suggesting that \"Mr Gray\", who \"has cultivated his manner to the highest pitch of languor yet attained\", was \"the original Dorian of the same name\". The Star retreated, made amends. A week later, a letter from Wilde, presumably written at Gray's instigation, appeared in the Daily Telegraph insisting that John Gray, an \"extremely recent acquaintance\", could not be described as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Wilde's.</p> <p>Why the sudden distancing? First, because Gray was unnerved by the generally horrified reception given to Wilde's story, seen as \"a gloating study of the mental and physical corruption of a fresh, fair and golden youth\" and a rallying cry for same-sex love in general, as the Wildean character, Lord Henry Wootton, addresses Dorian: </p> <p>\"You, Mr Gray, with your rose-red youth and your rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid, thoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame.\"</p> <p>Shame! Dorian Gray was still being cited five years after publication in the notorious trials of Oscar Wilde - trials at which John Gray, by this time panic-stricken, hired his own lawyer to keep a watching brief.</p> <p>There was also, no doubt, an element of jealousy in Gray's withdrawal from the man he once regarded as his \"beloved master and dear friend\". Wilde had taken up with Lord Alfred Douglas, socially far superior to Gray, and was behaving with increasing sexual recklessness, in defiance of the law. Gray had a strong instinct for self-preservation. By 1893 he was referring to \"the falling out with Oscar ... it is absolute\". Wilde himself lived to regret the separation. From prison, in De Profundis, he wrote to Alfred Douglas \"when I compare my friendship with you with my friendship with such still younger men as John Gray and Pierre Lou\u00ffs I feel ashamed. My real life, my higher life, lay with them and such as them.\"</p> <p>The spiritual conflicts of those years, the years that Father Gray looked back on as his \"course of sin\", are suggested in the very best of the short stories he wrote, \"The Person in Question\". This obviously autobiographical tale, most likely written in 1892, was discovered years later in typescript in the Dominican Chaplaincy in Edinburgh and finally published in 1958. It is a doppelg\u00e4nger narrative about a young man haunted by the apparition of himself as he will be in 25 years' time if he continues on his hedonistic life. It opens in the Caf\u00e9 Royal, that hall of mirrors much frequented by Gray, as indeed by Wilde, where \"the person in question\" orders exactly the lunch the indolent young man has ordered: a sardine, cold roast beef (very underdone), followed by some vegetable marrow and a small bottle of Niersteiner with soda water. From then on, wherever he goes he sees his double. The horrifying vision of his future leads to mania, as Gray's own psychological crisis brought him to the edge of suicide. </p> <p>During the crisis year of 1892, Gray was preparing a collection of his poems under the title Silverpoints. Originally Wilde had undertaken to finance it. In the end, the costs were underwritten by Gray's new protector, the wealthy Russian-born Jewish connoisseur and expert on matters Uranian, Marc-Andr\u00e9 Raffalovich, a man so ugly his own mother was said to have rejected him. \"You are an angel to me,\" Gray told him. Wilde mocked him terribly, and this new liaison with Raffalovich was another factor in Gray's rift with Wilde. </p> <p>Influenced by the protective and circumspect Raffalovich, Gray left out his more obviously homoerotic poems when compiling Silverpoints. But the collection still has an overwhelming 1890s quality of decadence as, for instance, in \"The Barber\":</p> <blockquote> <p>I dreamed I was a barber; and </p> <p> there went </p> <p>Beneath my hand, oh! manes </p> <p> extravagant. </p> <p>Beneath my trembling fingers, </p> <p> many a mask</p> <p>Of many a pleasant girl. </p> </blockquote> <p>The tall slim volume was designed by Charles Ricketts in conscious imitation of a Persian saddle book with special binding, typography and floriated initial letters: the book itself as work of art. Ada Leverson described Gray's poems as \"the tiniest rivulets of text meandering through the very largest meadows of margin\", going on to suggest that Wilde might take a tip and publish \"a book all margin; full of beautiful unwritten thoughts\". Besides Gray's own poems, Silverpoints includes his translations from Mallarm\u00e9, Baudelaire, Verlaine and Rimbaud. Gray had personal links with the French symbolists. In later years, his must have been the only church in Scotland to say an annual mass for the soul of Paul Verlaine.</p> <p>Gray came from a Methodist family. His original conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1890 had been half-hearted. But once he was established in a m\u00e9nage with Raffalovich, he became seriously devout. Soon Raffalovich himself was baptised in the church of the Jesuit Fathers in Farm Street. The two men were instrumental in converting the dying Aubrey Beardsley, and Gray wrote a somewhat self-congratulatory introduction to Beardsley's Last Letters, published in 1904.</p> <p>His own writing changed dramatically. Gray now turned away from the fin-de-si\u00e8cle self-indulgences of Silverpoints to the muted, penitential tone of his religious translations, published under the title Spiritual Poems</p> <p>Once ordained, he removed himself as far as possible from the haunts of his old decadence. His aim was now to work \"entirely among the hopeless poor\" and he became assistant curate at St Patrick's Church in the Cowgate, a rough and dilapidated district in Edinburgh's Old Town inhabited mainly by Irish labourers.</p> <p>In 1906, he moved to his own parish and a wonderful new church, St Peter's, Morningside, designed by the Scottish Arts and Crafts architect Robert Lorimer. The church-building was financed mainly by Raffalovich, now settled in Edinburgh close to Father Gray. Their priest was adored by the parishioners, although they evidently found him rather baffling. It was not just a matter of the black sheets in the presbytery. Gray was a creature of \"polished reserve\". There are many references in memoirs of the period to his mask-like countenance, his enigmatic, heavy-lidded Mona Lisa eyes. He became a cult figure in church circles, appearing in Ronald Firbank's novel Inclinations as the eloquent and touching preacher Father Brown.</p> <p>One of Wilde's much-resented jibes about Raffalovich had focused on his literary aspirations: \"Poor Andr\u00e9! He came to London with the intention of founding a salon, and he has succeeded only in opening an eating house.\" In Edinburgh, Raffalovich got his own back. Sunday luncheons and Tuesday dinner parties at his house in Whitehouse Terrace became a famous meeting point in Scottish artistic and intellectual life. After lunch, the guests would be led into the study to admire Eric Gill's sculpture of Sebastian, the saint whose name Raffalovich took after his conversion. \"I have the feeling,\" wrote one habitu\u00e9, \"that some of the guests were a little embarrassed by the martyr's nudity.\" Saint Sebastian was left by Gray to the Tate Gallery after Raffalovich's death.</p> <p>The friends died almost simultaneously, Raffalovich in February 1934, Gray - now Canon Gray - four months later. The funeral panegyric called Gray \"a living example of priestly virtue\", praising the \"orderliness, regularity and punctuality of his life and household, his tranquil tidy soul\".</p> <p>Gray faded from view until the early 1960s, when Father Brocard Sewell, a Carmelite friar and obsessive resurrectionist of forgotten figures of the 1890s, published a book of biographical essays. At the time, his more elderly parishioners remembered Canon Gray, but few were conscious of the Dorian connection, or of the cost to him in attaining his apparent plateau of tranquillity.</p> <p>However, there are hints in his last and most compelling work, Park: A Fantastic Story, published 1931-32, of a dangerously heightened self-consciousness, which remind me of Gray's comment in a rare unguarded moment to a fellow priest: \"If I were to relax for a single moment, God knows what would happen to me.\" The central character, the Rev Dr Mungo Park, named after the great African explorer, is a 59-year-old priest, a mysterious figure with some \"power of dissimulation\" on account of \"his peculiar position\". The book is a futuristic fantasy, in the mode of William Morris's News from Nowhere and HG Wells's A Modern Utopia. Mungo Park, who has died, resurfaces to find himself in a world of black ascendancy, in which the degenerate white population inhabits caverns of the lower depths.</p> <p>Mungo Park knows quite well that he is dead, but keeps on tramping, just as Gray himself was an indefatigable walker, stumping through the country in his heavy hobnail boots, tramping on and away from the guilt of being Dorian. \"All excess, as well as all renunciation, brings its own punishment,\" as Wilde explained the moral underlying The Picture of Dorian Gray</p> <p>The flamboyance of this paradox appeals to Matthew Bourne, who claims that the story of Dorian Gray has been high on his list of possible dance dramas for some time. He's been attracted by a number of themes in Wilde's story: the obsession with staying young, and the depravity and corruption beneath apparent perfection, especially in the worlds of politics and art. Bourne is fascinated by the risks we still run in the pursuit of beauty, and the way that reckless pleasure can rebound on itself.</p>",

After a theatrical delay she appeared, a stocky figure with pigtails and a flouncy skirt, and she waded through wellwishers towards the ring.</p> <p>Minutes later she had her opponent, a self-confessed sexist known as Eastern Hunter, pinned against a corner. Her foot pushed deeper into his neck. He yelped and collapsed. Rosa mounted the ropes, bounced for momentum, leaped backwards and crashlanded on the prostrate form. The cheers were deafening.</p> <p>Welcome to lucha libre, freestyle wrestling with a Bolivian twist. This macho sport in this macho country, South America's most impoverished and conservative, has been flipped into an unlikely feminist phenomenon.</p> <p>Indigenous women known as cholitas, physically strong from manual labour but long considered powerless and subservient, have become stars of the ring. They train like men, fight like men - and beat men.</p> <p>\"We have been discriminated against since the beginning for the simple fact of being women, and indigenous women at that,\" said Carmen Rosa, whose real name is Polonia Ana Choque. \"Men used to mock us but we have come further than male fighters.\"</p> <p>At a recent night-time bout in El Alto, an impoverished satellite city overlooking the capital, La Paz, the 38-year-old mother-of-two emerged bloodied but triumphant. The crowd applauded and young women and girls chanted: \"Women on top, men below.\"</p> <p>A ramshackle ring with pantomime theatrics in a near-freezing slum high in the Andes, with drunk men among the spectators, it was an incongruous scene for female empowerment and the subversion of gender cliches.</p> <p>Yet it reflected a wider breakthrough for indigenous women. For centuries Spanish colonialists and indigenous patriarchs restricted cholitas to child-rearing and manual labour and denied them education. Strikingly visible in felt bowler hats, colourful shawls and multilayered skirts, they were a silent underclass.</p> <p>That has begun to change. Since sweeping to power two years ago, President Evo Morales, the country's first indigenous leader, has championed the rights of the Aymara and Quechua majority, including women. Cholitas occupy many junior official posts and several senior ones in the government and judicial system.</p> <p>\"The system was made for us to be peasants all our lives,\" said Celima Torrico, Bolivia's first indigenous woman justice minister. \"We have more space now but it is lamentable we were kept in the darkness for so long.\" </p> <p>Bolivia remains patriarchal and girls and women still lag in literacy and opportunities compared to those in neighbouring Argentina and Chile, which have female presidents.</p> <p>\"There is still a lot of prejudice, violence and physical control over women,\" said Lourdes Montero, an indigenous women's rights activist. \"It will take time. But cholitas know they need to fight [for their rights]. There's a resurgence of pride in the skirt.\"</p> <p>The wrestling cholitas reflect the limitations and possibilities of this feminist surge. Conceived in 2001 to spice up traditional male-only bouts, they were presented as a novelty on par with fighting dwarves, with whom they shared billing. But gradually they became the main draw and there are now several dozen semi-professional female wrestlers. The most successful, such as Yolanda \"the Loved One\", Julia \"from La Paz\" and Ana \"the Avenger\", tour abroad.</p> <p>They lift weights, hike mountains and practise half-nelsons, headlocks, piledrives and other moves under the guidance of coaches such as Daniel Torrico, a former champion known as Mr Atlas. The \"skirted ones\" earned respect, he said. \"They train alongside men and we have seen that they can do a lot.\"</p> <p>Some have also showed business agility. One group fired its male manager, who it accused of exploitation, and set itself up as \"The Goddesses of the Ring\", a band of touring cholitas with the motto: \"Vengeance and victory in the ring.\"</p> <p>\"Men ate the cake and left us the crumbs,\" said Carmen Rosa, one of the founders. \"But now we are united and advancing. The idea is to show that women can do this on their own.\" </p> <p>On a good night The Champion, whose dimpled smile glints with gold teeth, earns \u00a315. Not enough to abandon her day job of running a small store and making packed lunches but enough to persuade her husband, Oscar Cahuasca, to support her unorthodox career sideline. \"It helps pay the bills,\" he said.</p> <p>Rosa's daughter, Corina Quispe, 21, used to bite her lip in embarrassment when asked about her mother. \"But then after she became the Champion and started touring abroad I started to feel very proud.\"</p> <p>Some male wrestlers have welcomed women as agents of progress. \"It shows that in this country we all have the same rights,\" said Angel Lopez, 19, also known as the Mummy, a character swathed in bandages who is delivered to the ring in a coffin.</p> <p>But traditionalists are appalled. \"The cholitas are not equal to men, they shouldn't be doing this. It's as simple as that,\" said Juan Carlos Acrapi, 28, who in the ring becomes the masked, bellowing, chest-thumping Eastern Hunter.</p> <p>To a large extent bouts are choreographed pantomime but a recent contest between Eastern Hunter and Rosa turned serious when she cut her head. Furious, she flipped her opponent and tore off his mask, the ultimate humiliation. Climbing the ropes to address the ecstatic crowd, her face flushed with triumph, it was the cholita's turn to bellow: \"Who is better? Men or women? Always women!\"</p>",
  "<p>The former Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, yesterday accused the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague of being a \"Nato court\" bent on killing him.</p> <p>Appearing on 11 charges of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, Karadzic challenged the legitimacy of the court, refused to enter any pleas and insisted on defending himself.</p> <p>The strategy outlined yesterday indicated that the 63-year-old, arrested in Belgrade last month after 13 years as Europe's most wanted fugitive, intends to use the tribunal as a stage on which to present himself as a victim of alleged western treachery.</p> <p>Karadzic is charged with responsibility for the most horrendous crimes in Europe since the Nazis, including the Serbian slaughter of almost 8,000 Muslims at Srebrenica in July 1995, the long siege of Sarajevo, and the \"ethnic cleansing\" of north-western Bosnia in the autumn of 1992, when tens of thousands of non-Serbs were killed and hundreds of thousands driven from their homes.</p> <p>At Karadzic's second pre-trial hearing yesterday, Judge Iain Bonomy, the Scottish high court judge who presided over the trial of the late Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, ordered the defendant to stand, hear the charges, and enter a plea.</p> <p>\"Count One, you are charged with genocide,\" said the judge.</p> <p>\"I will not plead in line with my standpoint towards this court,\" Karadzic replied, appearing more confident than when first brought before the tribunal at the end of last month.</p> <p>When the judge ordered a plea of not guilty to be entered, Karadzic interrupted him.</p> <p>\"May I hold you to your word?\" he asked.</p> <p>\"What word?\"</p> <p>\"That I'm not guilty.\"</p> <p>\"We will see,\" said Judge Bonomy who was again interrupted by Karadzic when he sought to adjourn the hearing after 22 minutes.</p> <p>Karadzic said he would be assembling a team of \"associates and helpers\" to assist him in conducting his own defence, a strategy that is certain to create delays in the smooth running of the case.</p> <p>Some of his most prominent fellow-Serb defendants, including Milosevic and Vojislav Seselj, an extreme nationalist leader, have adopted the same time-wasting tactics.</p> <p>Since being extradited to The Hague, Karadzic has delivered 10 written submissions complaining about various aspects of the proceedings and claiming that former officials from the Clinton administration in the 1990s want him dead.</p> <p>Karadzic was the political leader of the Bosnian Serbs during the 1992-95 Bosnia war. He headed the main Serbian party in Bosnia and was president of the self-proclaimed Serbian republic in half of Bosnia, and was indicted for genocide and crimes against humanity in 1995. </p> <p>He retired from politics a year after the war ended and vanished until he was arrested on a bus in Belgrade in Serbia last month disguised as a long-haired alternative medicine aficionado under the alias Dragan Dabic.</p> <p>\"I have stopped using a false name. I think all parties should do the same,\" he told the judge, claiming that the tribunal was operating under false pretences.</p> <p>\"I am deeply convinced this is a Nato court,\" he said. \"This court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community, whereas it is in fact a court of Nato whose aim is to liquidate me.\"</p> <p>While Judge Bonomy was brisk with the accused, he also voiced exasperation with the American lawyers leading the prosecution in what is the most important case to come before the tribunal in its 15-year history.</p> <p>The prosecution is in the process of revising the charge sheet which was last amended in 2000 to take account of case law and evidence at the tribunal in the past eight years and also to streamline the case against Karadzic.</p> <p>The prosecutors said they hoped to deliver the amended indictment by the end of September. Judge Bonomy was visibly annoyed, asking why the prosecution had waited eight years until the suspect was in custody before starting to revise the charge sheet.</p>",
  "<p>PartyGaming has seen the number of new poker players signing up to its website shrink by almost a third as the group has lost market share to aggressive rivals.</p> <p>Once the largest poker operator in the world, PartyGaming has been losing ground to competitors able to offer bigger tournament prize money because they attract larger player numbers. In particular, share has been ceded to a handful of rogue operators - led by privately owned Poker Stars and Full Tilt - which continue to take bets from US customers in breach of anti-online gaming laws passed in October 2006.</p> <p>PartyGaming, primarily focused on the European market, has also been losing ground to poker network providers, which operate by pooling players from smaller poker sites under licence agreements.</p> <p>PartyGaming said its new poker player sign-ups for the six months to June 30 were down by 32% to 235,200. The number of active players slipped 7% to 62,600.</p> <p>Poker performance since the half-year has also disappointed. New chief executive Jim Ryan said the traffic on its PartyPoker site had been \"slightly softer than expected\" with, on average, 993 player sign-ups and 50,800 active players a day. The division accounts for 55% of group operating profit, compared with 62% a year ago.</p> <p>Ryan, who has been in the job two months, said he planned to develop a network poker offer for PartyGaming as well as \"white label\" deals with big-name brands from outside the gaming industry.</p> <p>The move is a tacit admission that the PartyGaming business model needs to evolve rapidly to regain market share. Three years ago the company spent \u00a3140m buying out \"skin\" agreements with Empire Online because it wanted control of its customer base and marketing. Empire had recruited players to PartyGaming through its \"skin\" websites.</p> <p>Ryan insisted the development of network and white-label poker would not be at the expense of PartyPoker.com, the group's core poker site. \"We are the big guys on the street and we will remain in that position,\" he said.</p> <p>Falling activity and new sign-ups for PartyPoker in the half-year came despite an increase in the amount spent on player loyalty and sign-up bonuses, which represented 14.6% of poker revenue compared with 11.7% for the first half of 2007.</p> <p>PartyGaming's poker market share globally is estimated at 8% compared with 12% a year ago. Ryan said PartyGaming was close to launching a next-generation poker platform, which would be accompanied by a re-branding of PartyPoker.com. He said he was confident this would prove a fillip for new sign-ups.</p> <p>Some analysts said they were also concerned that revenues from PartyGaming's casino arm appeared to have fallen sharply this month. But Ryan added that threats to poker player numbers was also impacting the casino business as many casino punters started out playing on PartyPoker.com. PartyGaming posted half-year underlying profit up 76% at $64.9m (\u00a335m) on revenues ahead by 17% to $255m.</p>",
  "<p>This summer's misery for energy consumers reached a climax yesterday when the last two of the big six suppliers raised prices for millions of household customers.</p> <p>ScottishPower, which has just over 5 million customers, said gas bills would rise by 34% from the beginning of next month, and electricity by 9%. Npower said it was putting up gas prices by 26% and electricity by 14% for its 6.6 million customers with immediate effect.</p> <p>The latest increases come amid growing calls for a windfall tax on energy companies to help the increasing numbers of households struggling to cope with rising energy bills at a time when food and fuel costs are also increasing.</p> <p>Yesterday a coalition of Age Concern, Child Poverty Action Group and National Energy Action increased the pressure for government action by demanding measures to make social tariffs for energy fairer and more effective. The coalition said that 5.5 million households were likely to face fuel poverty - defined as spending more than 10% of income on heating and lighting - this winter.</p> <p>Age Concern's director general, Gordon Lishman, said: \"Many pensioners already worrying about whether they can afford to heat their homes this winter will be outraged by news of yet more colossal price hikes. </p> <p>\"It is a huge worry that one in three pensioner households are likely to be living in fuel poverty by the end of 2008 and many are already feeling forced to cut back on essential food or fuel.\"</p> <p>Tim Wolfenden, head of home services at uSwitch.com, a price comparison and switching service, said: \"All the major suppliers have increased prices for a second time this year. This is a heavy blow and few households will emerge unscathed or unconcerned about the future affordability of their energy.\" </p> <p>The government is expected to respond to the calls for help for people struggling with rising fuel bills within the next few days, though it remains unclear how any further help will be funded. An extra \u00a3225m from companies for social programmes for poorer customers over the next three years was announced earlier this year but the companies face demands to go further. The government is said to be wary of a windfall tax on the sector when the industry is facing the challenge of finding more than \u00a3100bn to invest in renewable generation and the replacement of ageing nuclear power plants, and coal-fired stations that will have to close under European legislation.</p> <p>Earlier this summer EDF Energy, British Gas and more recently E.ON and Scottish and Southern Energy all raised prices. The second round of increases by the big six takes the average household bill on standard plans for gas and electricity combined into a range of \u00a31,200 to more than \u00a31,300, depending on the supplier, according to uSwitch.com. At the beginning of the year average dual fuel bills for all six were well below \u00a31,000.</p> <p>The companies blame the rising cost of wholesale gas and power prices for the increases for residential customers. Gas prices are linked to oil prices because of the UK's increasing dependence on imports from continental Europe where gas contracts are often indexed to the price of oil. International coal prices have also risen sharply.</p> <p>Yesterday ScottishPower, which is owned by Iberdrola of Spain, said coal prices had risen by 45% since February, while wholesale gas prices had climbed 65% and electricity by 55% over the same period. By contrast, it said, its own prices for dual fuel users would rise an average of 25%.</p> <p>Willie MacDiarmid, ScottishPower's director of energy retail, said: \"These are difficult times and we understand the financial impact this announcement will have on our customers. Although we're one of the last companies to announce increases we're sorry we couldn't hold on any longer. However we have worked very hard to protect people for as long as possible from these considerable increases in the wholesale market.\"</p> <p>Giuseppe Di Vita, managing director of npower, part of German utility RWE, said the decision had been taken \"extremely reluctantly, especially as household budgets are being squeezed so much\".</p>",
  "<p>The gun shown here, a Webley, is up for sale in London for \u00a3150, one of hundreds of such weapons that are easily and cheaply available on the streets of the UK's big cities, a Guardian investigation can reveal.</p> <p>The variety of weapons on offer in Britain is extensive and includes machine guns and shotguns, as well as pistols and converted replicas. A source close to the trade in illegal weapons contacted by the Guardian listed a menu of firearms that are available on the streets of the capital. </p> <p>\"You can get a clean [unused] 9mm automatic for \u00a31,500, a Glock for a couple of grand and you can even make an order for a couple of MAC-10s,\" he said. \"Or you can get a little sawn-off for \u00a3150. They're easy enough to get hold of. You'll find one in any poverty area, every estate in London, and it's even easier in Manchester, where there are areas where the police don't go.</p> <p>\"People who use shotguns tend to be lower down the pecking order. There is less use of sawn-off or full length shotguns, and if a criminal wants street cred, he wants a self-loading pistol, a MAC-10 or an Uzi submachine gun.\"</p> <p>This week a man who ran a \"factory\" for converting replica weapons into working guns was jailed for life. Police believe the products of Grant Wilkinson's workshops were used in more than 50 shootings, including eight murders. His speciality was turning legally purchased MAC-10s into weapons that could fire live rounds, an increasingly common practice.</p> <p>According to David Dyson, a leading firearms consultant, it is possible to learn through the internet how to make a firearm, given a degree of skill, and converted deactivated weapons also feature in shootings.</p> <p>But it is the arrival of eastern European weapons that, alongside a homegrown industry in converting them, has contributed to the firearms glut. \"There has been an influx from eastern Europe and particularly from Poland, and there are also a lot coming in from people who have served in Afghanistan and Iraq,\" said the source. \"In Liverpool docks, you can put in an order for 10 guns and some grenades and they'll say OK and two weeks later, they will be there - and they are straight goers.\"</p> <p>According to Dyson, the latest \"weapon of choice\" is a Russian 8mm Baikal self-defence pistol, originally used for firing CS gas. \"They are legally sold in Germany and won't fire a bullet but they can be converted by removing the partially blocked barrel, and replacing it with a rifled barrel,\" he said. \"After other small alterations, it can then fire 9mm bulleted ammunition. The replacement barrel is longer than the original, and is threaded so that it will accept a silencer, which is commonly sold as part of the package.</p> <p>\"There are hundreds of these floating around and hundreds have been seized,\" he said. \"They look the part as they are based on the Russian military Makarov pistol. If you are a 20-year-old drug dealer and you want a gun, that is what you will get and it will cost about \u00a31,000 to \u00a31,500.\"</p> <p>\"The trends in firearms are driven by the suppliers,\" said Dyson. \"About two years ago, a supplier brought back hundreds of German-made revolvers, blank-firing pistols which can be bought legally in Germany. They were then converted and new cylinders made. They could then be sold for \u00a3700 to \u00a3800 when the supplier would have bought them for \u20ac60 and spent about \u00a330 on converting them.\"</p> <p>Home Office data shows that gun crime is up since last year, despite the recent doubling of sentences for possessing or supplying firearms. There were 9,803 firearms offences in England and Wales in the year to March 2008 with most in London, Manchester and the West Midlands.</p> <p>Most buyers are involved with drug dealing, the source said. Some are used to rob other dealers in crimes that go unreported, others are used as protection while a deal is under way. \"Someone will have a tool and there is always one guy in a posse willing to use it. They will have one guy who doesn't give a fuck.</p> <p>\"Everyone wants to be a gangster now, mainly the kids. You have five or six in a little crew and one of them will be carrying. They want handguns - shotguns are too big and bulky. The sawn-off doesn't look so good but use a machine gun and you get known as a heavy guy. They have them just to be a chap on the street, to pose. Some of them walk around all day with a .38. It's 16-year-olds at it and it's getting like America, silly as it sounds.\"</p> <p>In terms of nationalities, the influx of eastern European criminals has changed the balance of power. \"Who's using the guns? The [Jamaican] Yardies' value for life was so minimal that they thought nothing of killing people,\" said the source. \"We don't like them, they have no moral code. But it's the Russians and the Polish and Albanians around now. They are bullies. They want to take over the flesh business. The Russians are cold-hearted fuckers. What they have been doing is following the card boys [who put cards advertising prostitutes in phone booths in central London] and then taking the girls hostage, armed if need be.\"</p> <p>Detective Chief Inspector Colin Sutton, who has investigated some of London's most high profile shooting murders, said he believed the age of offenders was getting younger, and sometimes guns seemed to be used for the slightest reason.</p> <p>\"Playground squabbles are now being settled with guns,\" he said. \"And drug dealers are taking a policy decision to get youngsters to carry guns.\"</p> <p>He said guns could be purchased for a few hundred pounds in many parts of London. \"You can hire a gun for a period and, if the gun has already been used for a murder, the going rate comes down.\"</p> <p>While the conviction of Wilkinson was seen as a breakthrough, it is accepted that with the increased traffic between Britain and eastern Europe, stemming the flow of weapons remains an almost impossible task. </p> <p>\"Guns are always available,\" said Dyson. \"You can go to the former Soviet Union, or countries with less stringent regulations than ours, and although British Customs have their successes, many guns appear to be smuggled into the UK.\" </p> <p>Amnesties for people to hand over weapons are greeted with scepticism by criminals. \"The gun amnesties are meaningless,\" the source said. \"All you get handed in are guns from boys who wanted to be gangsters and then got a job or someone whose mother found it in their bedroom. If I had a gun, I wouldn't take part because, if I got pulled, what would I say - 'Oh, I'm just on my way to the amnesty.' Also if it gets out that you've given in your tool, people will think you're a wrong 'un.\"</p> <p>Few professional criminals would keep guns on their premises. \"Only silly people keep it in their homes. Normally, you have a 'keeper' a couple of miles away and some of them have been at it for 20 years. It's best to have an old fellow with no previous or a woman. You keep the ammunition separate because you'll get a much heavier sentence if you have them together.\" </p> <p>When guns are moved from place to place, a young woman is often used as the courier because there is less risk of her being stopped and searched.</p> <p>What is not in dispute is the devastating effect that the casual use of a gun over a minor argument can have on dozens of people. In December 2006, Sean \"Stretch\" Jenkins, 36, an amiable, 6ft 8in window-cleaner from south London, was shot dead at a party in Carshalton. His killer was a cocaine dealer called Joseph Greenland, a volatile man with a quick temper, who had apparently taken offence at something Jenkins said. The men had earlier been at a boxing night at Caesar's in Streatham, where there had been some fighting outside the ring. Greenland had left the party, driven home in his Range Rover, picked up a gun and returned to kill Jenkins in front of at least five witnesses, who were warned not to talk.</p> <p>None of the immediate witnesses gave evidence against Greenland, who had a reputation for threatening to \"annihilate\" anyone who crossed him, but there were traces of his DNA on a cigarette end and a wine glass at the party and his bragging about the shooting was to be his downfall. His recourse to a gun, for no other reason than some perceived slight, left Jenkins's six-year-old son without a father and saddened a wide network of friends and family. Greenland was jailed for life last week and will have to serve 30 years before he can be considered for parole.</p> <p>\"We got what we wanted,\" said the victim's mother, Maureen Jenkins, of the verdict and sentence last month. \"I went to the cemetery and said, 'Well, boy, I can put you to rest'.\" </p> <p>The detectives investigating the killing and the prosecution team that secured Greenland's conviction were \"marvellous\", she said. \"I shed tears every day and I probably will till the day I die. Why do these people have to kill for nothing? If they want to kill people, why don't they join the army? You don't ever think a shooting will happen in your life. It's all down to guns, just guns.\"</p> <p>The Guardian's source said that guns were becoming a first rather than a last recourse. \"A gun used to be used as a mediator; now everything is revolved with a gun. It's brought the heat on everyone. Before you would get a two [years jail sentence], now it's a five. It's getting like the US now, like The Wire. It's like a prediction of what will happen here. I think they all think they're playing Grand Theft Auto. It's madness out there.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Cairngorm mountains of north-east Scotland are Britain's Arctic. In winter, storm winds of up to 170mph rasp the upper shires of the range, and avalanches scour its lee slopes. Even in summer, snow lies in the deeper corries of the massif, sintering slowly into ice. The aurora borealis can be seen from its summits - billowing curtains of green or, more rarely, red light. In places, the wind blows so insistently that pine trees grow to just a few inches high, spreading across the ground in densely woven dwarf forests. It is a terrain shaped by what Nan Shepherd, in her masterpiece about the region, called \"the elementals\".</p> <p>Shepherd was born in Aberdeen in 1893 and died there in 1981, and during her long life she spent hundreds of days and covered thousands of miles exploring the Cairngorms on foot. Her reputation rests on the three modernist novels she published between 1928 and 1933 (The Quarry Wood, The Weatherhouse, A Pass in the Grampians), but to my mind her most important work is her least known - an 80-page prose meditation called The Living Mountain. Shepherd, who worked as a teacher for most of her life, wrote the book during the last years of the second world war and the first years of its aftermath. She then put the manuscript in a drawer for three decades, until finally she consented to its publication in 1977. It is now almost forgotten, kept admirably in print by Canongate, its admirers fierce but few. Given the current surge of interest in the literature of nature and place, however, it's a book that might - should - attract a new generation of readers.</p> <p>The Living Mountain is a difficult work to describe. A celebratory prose-poem? A geo-poetic quest? A philosophical inquiry into the nature of knowledge? None of these quite fits, though it is all of them in part. Shepherd herself called it \"a traffic of love\", with \"traffic\" implying \"exchange\" and \"mutuality\" rather than \"congestion\" or \"blockage\". Its prose is weathered in both senses: filled with different kinds of climate, but also the result of decades of contact with \"the elementals\". It is about the Cairngorms in the same way that Ulysses is about Dublin, or Mrs Dalloway is about London - which is to say, it is attentive to the specifics of its chosen landscape, but also passionately metaphysical. </p> <p>The book is in 12 sections, each of which explores an aspect of the Cairngorms and life on them: \"Water, Frost and Snow\", \"The Recesses\", \"The Senses\", \"Man\", \"Being\". Reading the book, you realise that these apparently separate sections are bound laterally to each other by rhymes of colour, thought and word, so that they form a transverse weave. In this way, too, the book's form acts out its central proposition, which is that the world will not fall into divisible realms, as an apple may be sliced, but is instead a meshwork of interrelations. \"So there I lie on the plateau,\" writes Shepherd. </p> <p>\"under me the central core of fire from which was thrust this grumbling grinding mass of plutonic rock, over me blue air, and between the fire of the rock and the fire of the sun, scree, soil and water, moss, grass, flower and tree, insect, bird and beast, wind, rain and snow - the total mountain.\"</p> <p>\"And\" is one of Shepherd's favourite words in The Living Mountain, being the conjunction that implies connection without hierarchy.</p> <p>Most works of mountain literature are written by men, and most male mountaineers are focused on the goal of the summit. Shepherd, however, goes into the Cairngorms aimlessly, \"merely to be with the mountain as one visits a friend, with no intention but to be with him\". \"I am on the plateau again, having gone round it like a dog in circles to see if it is a good place,\" she begins one section, \"I think it is, and I am to stay up here for a while.\"</p> <p>The Living Mountain is worth reading for its observational acuity alone. It is thick with the kinds of perception that come only from \"staying up for a while\"; from the repeated idle traversals of a landscape: \"Birch needs rain to release its odour. It is a scent with body to it, fruity like old brandy, and on a wet warm day one can be as good as drunk with it.\" Shepherd notices and records \"the coil over coil\" of a golden eagle's ascent on a thermal, \"the immature scarlet cups of the lichen\", the starry saxifrage and \"the white-winged ptarmigan\". She spends an October night in air that is \"bland as silk\", and while half-asleep feels herself become stone-like, \"rooted far down into immobility\". She notes how a river's currents can weave floating pine needles into balls, similar to wrens' nests: structures so intertwined that \"they can be lifted out of the water and kept for years, a botanical puzzle to those who have not been told the secret of their formation\". (These pine-needle balls are also surreptitious emblems of Shepherd's own tightly knit and tiny work, itself \"kept for years\".) </p> <p>Shepherd is a fierce looker, then. And like many fierce lookers, she is also a mystic, for whom empiricism is the first step to immanence. Her descriptions always move beyond the merely material. Up on the mountain, she writes, \"the eye sees what it didn't see before, or sees in a new way what it had already seen. So the ear, the other senses. These moments come unpredictably, yet governed, it would seem, by a law whose working is dimly understood.\" Like her friend and fellow modernist novelist Neil Gunn, and like the Scottish explorer-essayist WH Murray, Shepherd had read deeply in Buddhism. Shards of Zen philosophy glitter in the prose of all three writers, like mica flecks in granite. Reading their work now - with the fusion of Scottish culture and Buddhist metaphysics - remains astonishing: like seeing a Noh play performed in a kailyard, or chrysanthemums flourishing in a corrie. </p> <p>\"A mountain,\" writes Shepherd Zennishly, \"has an inside.\" It is a correct but counterintuitive proposition, for we tend to think of mountains in terms of their exteriors - peaks, plateaus, cliffs. But Shepherd is always looking inside the Cairngorm landscape. Again and again her eyes pry through surface: into cracks in rocks, into the luminous interior of lochs or rivers. \"Into\", in The Living Mountain, is a preposition that gains, through repeated use, the power of a verb. Shepherd is also fascinated by mirages of the mountain-world, the illusions that can be brought on by snow, mist, cloud or distance. She punningly calls these illusions \"misspellings\", visual errors that possess an accidental magic.</p> <p>In one memorable passage, Shepherd describes looking at a croft during a rain shower. The wet air acts as a lens, multiplying and redistributing her sightlines, so that she seems to view all sides of the barn simultaneously. Shepherd's own style possesses a similar stereoscopic quality. Reading The Living Mountain, you experience a curious visual dissonance. Your sight feels . . . scattered, as though you've suddenly gained the compound eye of a dragonfly. This effect is created by her refusal to privilege a single perspective. The prose watches now from the point of view of the eagle, now from that of the walker, now from that of the creeping juniper. In this way we are brought to see the earth \"as the earth must see itself\". </p> <p>\"That's the way to see the world, in our own bodies,\" wrote the poet, Buddhist and forester Gary Snyder, and his words could stand as an epigraph to The Living Mountain. For Shepherd, being outdoors is a profoundly sensuous experience: \"I am like a dog - smells excite me. The earthy smell of moss . . . is best savoured by grubbing.\" She lives off wild food, eating cranberries, cloudberries, blaeberries, drinking from the \"strong white\" water of rivers. She swims in lochs, and sleeps on hillsides, to be woken by the sharp press of a robin's claw upon her bare arm or the snuffle of a grazing deer. She records with brilliant exactness how frost \"stiffens the muscles of the chin\" (a part of the body we don't usually associate with muscularity, let alone thermometric sensitivity), or the pleasure of \"running my hand after rain through juniper . . . for the joy of the wet drops trickling over the palm\". For Shepherd, though, this sensuous relish was not an antagonist of thought, but its accomplice. In the mountains, she writes, \"the body may be said to think\". </p> <p>This is her book's most radical proposition. Radical, because Shepherd was a woman writing out of a Highland Scottish culture in which the cherishing of the body was not easily discussed. And radical because, as philosophy, it was cutting-edge. In the same years that Shepherd composed The Living Mountain, the French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty developed his influential theory of the body-subject. For Merleau-Ponty, post-Cartesian philosophy had fallaciously divided body and mind. He argued instead that we are continually \"embedded\" in the \"flesh\" of the world: that we experience a constant exchange or \"traffic\" with our environment in ways that both exceed and inform our rational, intentional mind. His work, particularly The Phenomenology of Perception (1945), was dedicated to enriching the idea of the body, such that it could be said both to perceive and to think. Merleau-Ponty described this embodied experience as \"knowledge in the hands\", a phrase that could have come straight from Shepherd. \"The body is not . . . negligible,\" she wrote, \"but paramount\".</p> <p>\"The hands have an infinity of pleasure in them. The feel of things, textures, surfaces, rough things like cones and bark, smooth things like stalks and feathers and pebbles rounded by water, the teasing of gossamers . . . the scratchiness of lichen, the warmth of the sun, the sting of hail, the blunt blow of tumbling water, the flow of wind - nothing that I can touch or that touches me but has its own identity for the hand as much as for the eye.\"</p> <p>It's Shepherd's belief in what might be called \"bodily thinking\" that gives The Living Mountain its contemporary relevance. For more and more of us experience less and less contact with the world. We have come increasingly to forget that our minds are shaped by the bodily experience of being in the world - its spaces, textures, sounds, smells and habits - as well as by genetic traits we inherit and ideologies we absorb. We are, literally, losing touch. Shepherd saw this loss beginning more than 60 years ago, and her book both mourns it and warns against it: \"This is the innocence we have lost,\" she observes, \"living in one sense at a time to live all the way through.\" Her book is a wry, beautiful hymn to \"living all the way through\".</p> <p>And walking, for Shepherd, is the best way to \"live through\". On foot for hour after hour, you \"walk the flesh transparent\". \"On the mountain,\" she remarks in the book's closing sentences, \"I am beyond desire. It is not ecstasy . . . I am not out of myself, but in myself. I am. That is the final grace accorded from the mountain.\" This is Shepherd's version of Descartes's cogito - I walk therefore I am. She celebrates the metaphysical rhythm of the pedestrian, the iamb of the \"I am\", the beat of the placed and lifted foot.</p>",
  "<p>Lush Life is an ambitious, wide-ranging, meticulously plotted and - at points - brilliant novel. But at many more points I found it almost unreadable. Not because the subject matter is too painful, although it places before the reader a fair amount of mental and physical agony. And not because it is badly written, because some of the writing is great: great as in read-it-aloud-to-anyone-in-the-room great. No, the reason I found Lush Life so difficult to keep going with is that it is monumentally conceited.</p> <p>This is something that's very difficult to demonstrate by example, because it starts as a vague sense that the writing is very pleased with itself indeed, and ends up as a desire to rip the book up whenever another smug detail is slotted into place. Even sentences and paragraphs that are, in themselves, perfectly achieved seem to come with a pause after them - a pause to allow the reader a moment of awed admiration. Here's one character's backstory, in two lines: \"He thought of his parents' house: white chenille bedspreads and floral wallpaper; of Binghamton: fields of slush, gray highways to nowhere.\"</p> <p>In this pause-rhythm Richard Price resembles another American writer of super-polished and often grotesque prose, Harold Brodkey. Here's another place-description: \"The chief of detectives' office in 1PP was like a cabin in the sky, the 15th-floor area reception tricked out like a banged-up precinct house complete with an old wood-scarred receiving desk, poorly maintained fish tanks, and paint-chipped newel-and-post barriers, walls covered with cheaply framed photos, petty administrative notices, and an American flag big enough to cover a king-size bed.\" </p> <p>At first glance this may seem OK. Bloated, yes. Completely flaccid in rhythm, yes. But if you look closely it starts to fall apart. The two \"likes\" in the first two lines are something any English teacher would flag up as inept. \"Wood-scarred desk\" is a nonsense. Price means to say \"a desk made of wood that has been scarred\" but ends up saying \"a desk made of something else which has been scarred by wood\". \"Poorly maintained\" is, in contrast to the overstraining description around it, colourlessly weak. \"Petty\" is redundant in front of \"administrative notices\": all administrative notices are petty because, if information is important or urgent, it will be conveyed to people in some other form, not a notice. This may seem nitpicky, but is meant to represent the entire novel. What happens on the level of sentences also happens on the level of scenes and sections. Self-love pervades.</p> <p>One of the reasons for this, I think, is that Price is writing from within an empire that he may rail against but which he secretly loves for being so juicily, lushly corrupt. As a satirist, he is weak because he gives no indication of either believing or even dreaming that people might change their ways - and weaker still because the status quo doesn't, by itself, make him savagely indignant. Lush Life is devoid of social rage; it accepts everything on a level not much more advanced than \"shit happens\".</p> <p>The characters who come in for the most energetic rubbishing are the wannabe creatives who have overrun and gentrified what was previously a good, honest Lower East Side slum. One of these, Ike Marcus, is walking the empty early-morning backstreets along with a wannabe screenwriter and a wannabe actor, when they are approached by a couple of kids from the projects. The kids have a .22. The screenwriter hands over his wallet, keeping his eyes low. The actor, extremely drunk, pretends to be even more drunk and slumps to the floor. Marcus steps towards the kid with the gun, says \"Not tonight, my man\", and so commits what the cops later call \"suicide by mouth\".</p> <p>Like HBO's The Wire, for which Price writes, and for which his earlier work (especially Clockers) was one of the chief inspirations, Lush Life goes into the lives of all those affected by this crime and the investigation that follows - the victims, their relatives, the kids, the cops. It is full of vivid characters. Street-raised, tough-but-tender Yolanda (very like Kima from the first series of The Wire). Mr Marcus, Ike's father (very like Leland Palmer from Twin Peaks). It is crammed with memorable scenes, dialogue, images. And when the sentences brush up against humility, Price can do panoramic America like few other writers: \"He scanned the top-floor windows of the nearest . . . high-rise, maybe 50 yards away, saw the lives in there like little mouse plays, mostly everybody watching TV or talking on the phone.\"</p> <p>Richard Price would be such a wonderful writer, if he stopped thinking he was such a wonderful writer.</p> <p>\u2022 Toby Litt's novel I Play the Drums in a Band Called Okay is published by Hamish Hamilton.</p>",
  "<p>An undergraduate is warning students who use the specialist student insurer Endsleigh to check their policy's terms after the firm refused to pay her bike theft claim on what she described as an \"absurd technicality\".</p> <p>Engineering student Rehana Khanam has been unsuccessfully fighting Endsleigh since her Specialized racing bike was stolen from outside her college in Cambridge. Despite numerous letters and phone calls, the company has refused to pay her \u00a3350 claim because she hadn't removed the saddle and front wheel. </p> <p>\"The whole thing has been ridiculous, and has made me think twice about ever using Endsleigh again,\" says the 21-year-old. \"The bike was a 21st birthday present and as such was priceless to me. I locked it up properly using a substantial lock. But after I filed my claim I was told that, because I hadn't removed the saddle and front wheel, the company wouldn't pay out, even though the whole bike was taken. They told me that this was stipulated in the policy, which was complete news to me. Only when I looked at the small print did this point emerge.\"</p> <p>Her argument to Endsleigh's underwriter Pinnacle that this should have been made clear in the policy's wording fell on deaf ears. \"Endsleigh market themselves to students and the idea that everyone would be forced to take their front wheels and saddles into their lectures is completely unworkable,\" she says.</p> <p>When Guardian Money put this to the company, it seems it had come to this conclusion itself. It also agreed to pay her claim. In a statement it said: \"Endsleigh has updated its policies this year so that customers do not now need to remove the front wheel, saddle or any other part of the bicycle in order to be covered from theft. We recognised that this was often impractical for policyholders and so have updated our cover in order to make things easier for our customers. Although Ms Khanam's older policy clearly stated that they should be removed in order for it to be covered, we have decided to retrospectively pay her claim in light of the updated policies and as a goodwill gesture to a valued customer.\" The company also agreed to waive her \u00a335 excess.</p> <p>Her case highlights the problems faced by students insuring their belongings, and the high price they pay. Khanam was paying \u00a340 a year to insure her \u00a3350 bike and the policy had a 10% excess. Most students will find it cheaper to put their contents and bikes on their parents' home insurance policy, or better still, by buying a cheaper non-specialist student policy.</p> <p>This week, the Environmental Transport Association (<a href=\"http://www.eta.co.uk\">eta.co.uk</a>) a group that lobbies for greener transport, was offering to insure the same bike for \u00a331.25. </p> <p>The policy also includes third-party insurance up to \u00a31m, personal accident cover, and a cycle rescue package at a significant saving over Endsleigh's price - and not much more than it would cost to add to a home contents policy. </p> <p>The excess on a \u00a3350 bike would also be a more palatable \u00a325, making it a best-buy in the bike insurance world. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:m.brignall@theguardian.com\">m.brignall@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>The Italian front, often regarded as a sideshow, saw some of the bloodiest fighting of the first world war. A million men perished in what Ernest Hemingway called \"the most colossal, murderous, mismanaged butchery\" of the conflict. According to another witness, Italian troops advancing shoulder-to-shoulder on Austrian trenches high on the Dolomites and the Julian Alps, their officers leading with drawn swords, looked as though they were attempting mass suicide. On several occasions, in gestures of mercy unique to this front, Austrian machine-gunners simply ceased fire. \"Stop, go back!\" they shouted, as the Italians tried to clamber over mounds of their fallen comrades. \"We won't shoot any more. Do you want everyone to die?\" </p> <p>That certainly seemed to be the purpose of the Italian supreme commander, General Luigi Cadorna, whose homicidal endeavours extended to adopting the Roman punishment of decimation. This was the execution of one man in 10 (though Cadorna did not insist on that ratio) selected from units deemed to have shown a lack of pluck and dash. The shootings were carried out much as Hemingway described them in A Farewell to Arms. When one soldier in a batch of condemned men protested his innocence and said that he was the father of seven children, the divisional commander retorted: \"Let us be done with this jabbering. Shoot them at once. Orders are orders.\" </p> <p>Cadorna's orders were meant to terrorise his troops into unflinching obedience - like Stalin, he further encouraged them to go over the top by mounting machine-guns behind his own lines to fire on stragglers. But he was also anxious to demonstrate his own military virility, his implacable will to win. Proud, silent and aloof, surrounded by obsequious staff officers far from the guns, he projected an image of serene confidence. But he had no idea, apart from hurling his armies at bullets and barbed wire, how to break the military deadlock, and his progress was measured in vertical centimetres. If Field Marshal Douglas Haig - in Lloyd George's phrase - was brilliant to the top of his boots, Cadorna's brilliance never rose above his spurs.</p> <p>Yet, as emerges from Mark Thompson's magnificent history of a struggle conducted amid snow, cloud and crag, Italy got the general it deserved. Hailed as Duce well before Mussolini monopolised that title, Cadorna embodied the sacred egoism of the fatherland. This was the quasi-fascist spirit of aggression that had plunged Italy into the war in 1915, when it joined the apparently triumphant allies in order to \"redeem\" its \"natural\" mountain frontiers. Nationalists were not just bent on grabbing land for mercenary reasons, as Winston Churchill assumed when he dubbed Italy \"the harlot of Europe\". They wanted a human sacrifice to save their country's soul. As one of Cadorna's corps commanders said, the massacre of infantry was a beneficent purge, \"a necessary holocaust\".</p> <p>Thompson is wonderfully scathing about such necrophile nonsense, expressed most deliriously by the poet D'Annunzio and the Futurist Marinetti. They and their followers rejoiced in the vision of blood \"spurting from the veins of Italy\". They glorified war as \"the world's only hygiene\". They welcomed the prospect of mass destruction and rape: \"We shall ransack the mothers' wombs with fire.\" And they damned the ideals of liberalism, socialism and democracy, which was fit only for \"democretins\". D'Annunzio, who compared the experience of battle to an orgasm, played a characteristically vicious role in the conflict, once ordering batteries to fire on a column of his compatriots who had been taken prisoner. </p> <p>He also penned odes to Cadorna, contributing to a chorus of journalistic praise that helped to keep him in command despite his failures. Admittedly, criticism was difficult because of the all-pervading censorship, enshrined in a decree banning \"false news\" - ie the truth. This permitted the authorities not only to imprison Colonel Douhet, the prophet of air power, for exposing the supreme commander as a military primitive, but to arrest Neapolitan newsboys for shouting about Italian losses. The press also censored itself, cravenly but profitably participating in an elaborate system of official lying. The Corriere della Sera virtually acted as a ministry of information, with reporters drafting Cadorna's bulletins. </p> <p>The clerk guilty of the greatest treason was its star reporter, Luigi Barzini, who witnessed the full horror of the war but dramatised it as a heroic adventure. He complained privately: \"We are lurching from one disastrous action to the next, massacring whole divisions without inflicting equal damage on the enemy.\" Yet in print he hailed the supreme commander as a strategic genius whose theory of the offensive was irrefutable. It was much easier, Barzini assured his readers, \"to attack uphill against dominant positions than downhill against dominated positions\". Disgusted soldiers responded appropriately, using newspapers, as one wrote, \"to wipe their arses\". One propagandist who visited them at the front was awarded a bronze medal for valour and subsequently, wits quipped, a silver medal for his courage in accepting it - the same joke was later made about Mussolini's son-in-law, Ciano. </p> <p>The organised mendacity was designed, among other things, to conceal the fact that Italy, the least of the great powers, was entirely unprepared to take part in the great war. The nation had been jockeyed into the conflict by its reactionary premier, Antonio Salandra, with the connivance of the contemptible little king, Victor Emmanuel III. Its conscript army consisted mainly of peasants in uniform, at first lacking leather boots, iron helmets, warm greatcoats and waterproof capes. The army also lacked heavy artillery, high explosive, machine guns and aircraft, to say nothing of flame-throwers and poison gas, which the Austrians used to ghastly effect. Italian wire-cutters were little more than secateurs. And the absence of rock drills meant that they could not dig trenches in the Carso, the harsh limestone plateau overlooking the Isonzo river, where shell-bursts erupted like volcanoes.</p> <p>Food, too, was in short supply and Italian troops increasingly resembled emaciated scarecrows. When the Austrians counter-attacked in 1917 at Caporetto, where officers such as Erwin Rommel used new methods of infiltration, bypassing and cutting off strong points in anticipation of the blitzkrieg, Italian forces suffered a catastrophic defeat. Nearly 700,000 men were killed, wounded, captured or scattered. Italy lost ground containing 1.5 million people, thousands of whom starved to death under Austrian rule. Vittorio Orlando's new government dismissed Cadorna, who blamed the disaster on the ignominious faint-heartedness of Italian troops. But his replacement, Armando Diaz, stabilised the situation, abolished decimation, restored morale and led Italy to a belated victory as the central powers collapsed in 1918.</p> <p>D'Annunzio famously spoke of a \"mutilated victory\". This was because Italy, despite gaining territory in the Tyrol and Dalmatia at the peace settlement, did not receive the spoils its epic bloodletting was thought to deserve. Mussolini was to play with diabolical skill on his countrymen's bitterness at what seemed to them a monstrous allied betrayal. He exploited something akin to a psychology of defeat. He drew mystical inspiration and political vitality from the carnage. As D'Annunzio put it: \"Where masses of slaughtered flesh decompose, here sublime fermentations are born.\" Thus fascism sprang fully armed from the ashes of the great war. And the new Duce mobilised legions of its dead. Where allied war memorials spoke of peace, Mussolini constructed funereal fortresses like that on Monte Grappa. With commemorative tablets resembling gun ports, it was a quintessential emblem of fascist belligerence. </p> <p>Thompson's account of all this is original, masterly and definitive. He has not only read everything about the subject, he has also tramped the battlefields and talked to centenarian survivors. His descriptions of the gore, guts and filth of attrition in a petrified wilderness are vivid and terrible. His character sketches are penetrating and precise. His judgments are incisive. He is particularly good on literary aspects of the war, delicately anatomising, for example, the work of Italy's foremost war poet, Giuseppe Ungaretti, which \"burst like starlight from violence\". </p> <p>Perhaps Thompson's indictment of Italian military incompetence is too relentless. But nothing is more illuminating than his contrast between the modern British memory of the great war as a pointless shambles, and recollections in Italy, where it is seen as an expression of the most glorious qualities of the united nation. Rome's Museum of the Risorgimento displays this legend: \"Splendid Italy, binding herself forever in sacrifice.\" Like Hemingway, we are embarrassed by words such as sacred and sacrifice, and reckon \"the things that were glorious had no glory\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Piers Brendon's The Decline and Fall of the British Empire is published by Cape.</p>",
  "<p>I may have given the impression that my wife is a chucker-out, which is true, in that she hates clutter and therefore doesn't accumulate - which is the first stage - nor is she a gatherer, going out actively and acquiring - which is the next stage in full-blown, full blooded collecting.</p> <p>But there is another way in which a person can become a collector. Some are born collecting, for I have no doubt that there is a collecting gene, but others can have collecting thrust upon them. And that's what I've done to her over the years with pottery. Forced pieces upon her.</p> <p>For Christmas and birthdays and wedding anniversaries, I used to buy clothes, but then I lost my nerve, after a few disasters. Brooches, necklaces, rings... I've bought quite a lot of those - until I realised I was repeating myself, going for the same style, same colours, until I was buying literally exactly the same amber brooch or jade necklace that I'd bought the year before. </p> <p>Now I stick to pottery - nice old plates, bowls or cups. I look out for them all the time, all year round, when I'm going around the jumbles, car boots and charity shops searching for real treasures - ie stuff for myself. I hide them away, in the place I hide things away, and it's always a surprise for me as well. </p> <p>I look for pretty patterns, usually in brown or green - not blue, dear me, not blue; blue pottery is so corny - and always odd items, not sets. They get used - for eating from or off, or keeping fruit in - unlike my own collections. Mine serve no purpose, really; in fact, I often wonder why I bother.</p> <p>Three or four years ago I overheard her saying she does like Clarice Cliff. She was reading a magazine at the time, which I couldn't see, so at first I didn't know whether Clarice Cliff was a place or a person. Now I know she was a woman, a star ceramic designer of the 30s, the epitome of art deco pottery. </p> <p>Cliff's background was interesting. She wasn't trained, in the normal sense, at a London art college, but started at 13 as a factory girl in one of the Staffordshire potteries, wearing a pinny. She was born in 1899, but by the time she was 30 she had become a leading designer with her own name stamped on her pottery and her own lines, notably Bizarre. She became a role model for many working-class girls of the time, a public figure, seen as an independent, modern woman - though she lived at home with her parents in their terraced house until she was quite old, and had an affair with her married boss. </p> <p>Her pottery is incredibly colourful and vibrant, even I can see that, and very 30s in design and shape; today, once again, it is highly popular. Her best pieces fetch far more than I'm prepared to pay, as an outsider, knowing little about pottery. But so far I have bought two pieces. One is a nice bowl that cost \u00a380 at auction, which, to me, was a lot. I won't let my wife use it for day-to-day purposes, certainly not at that price. We keep it in our bedroom on a shelf, with glass eggs inside it. Very tasteful. And definitely a collectible.</p>",
  "<p>Howard Brown, the bespectacled buffoon who warbled his way through six years of Halifax ads, sings no more. Bosses have deemed his cheeky-chappy televisual demeanor as \"unsuitable for the current economic climate\". But maybe his demise could have been prevented had Howard headed to Hollywood before his 15 minutes of fame elapsed.</p> <p>As the rest of the world searches for spare coins down the back of the sofa, Tinseltown is getting a bump from the credit slump. 2007 was the most profitable year in American box-office history, earning almost \u00a310bn. And this year figures are already up by 4%. \"When times are bad, our business seems to buck the trend,\" says Dan Glickman, president of the Motion Picture Association of America. \"Movies are great therapy and a lot cheaper than a psychiatrist.\"</p> <p>He's right, well at least about the former. The history books show that Hollywood's a dab hand at surviving a financial storm. Over the last seven recessions, it's made profits in five economic downturns. And, thanks to this year's onslaught of mega-budget big hitters and old favourites, it's pulling in audiences even as the credit crunch begins to clamp down. Had Howard decamped to la-la land, he'd have been safe as houses. At least those that the Halifax hasn't repossessed.</p> <p><strong>The winners</strong></p> <p>As The Dark Knight has proved, we'd rather be in a cinema watching a dead man in smudged lipstick fighting a bloke who thinks he's a bat than weighing up the fiscal pros and cons of swapping Waitrose for Aldi. Batman's popularity may be fuelled more by a macabre interest in its star pre-mortem than by its plot, but it's still giving James Cameron sleepless nights as it threatens to sink Titanic as the biggest grosser of all time. It's in good company. This year, Iron Man made a steely $315m; Indiana Jones whipped up $313m while WALL-E has blasted its way to $210m and counting.</p> <p>It's not just the US film industry that's booming. 2007 was our best year yet with British films earning \u00a31.65bn worldwide - twice as much as 2006. July 2007 was the biggest single month of cinema-going in 40 years, helping overall box-office receipts hit \u00a3821m - up 8% on 2006. This year could be even better.</p> <p>\"The UK box office will always go up if there's a Harry Potter or a James Bond film released,\" says Stuart Kemp, London bureau chief of the Hollywood Reporter. \"And with both in the offing,the coming year will be pretty good.\"</p> <p>In Hollywood BCC (before credit crunch), a critical kicking meant the difference between a lengthy cinematic stay and a fast track to Blockbuster's rental shelf. But we've stopped listening to the naysayers. A combination of belt-tightening and ticket prices holding steady means we're quite willing to allow our quality control to slip for an inexpensive night out no matter how awful the offering. Derided Will Smith vehicle Hancock still became his eighth straight $100m earner, despite reviews branding it \"turgid\" and \"dire\". Sex And The City relied on brand loyalty, rather than quality, to help it fornicate past the $150m mark. </p> <p>The ultimate recession victors are the tried and tested Hollywood A-listers. Forbes, the bible of the affluent, reveals Will Smith is laughing all the way to the bank to deposit the $80m he raked in last year. Johnny Depp's Sweeney Todd and Captain Jack Sparrow helped him swashbuckle to a cool $72m while Eddie Murphy inexplicably earned $55m for a shoddy Shrek 3 and nonsensical Norbit. The top ten biggest earners brought home $731m between them.</p> <p><strong>The losers</strong></p> <p>If the recession has taught Hollywood anything, it's that not everyone can get away with serving us mutton dressed as offal.</p> <p>A promotional budget the size of Malawi's national debt couldn't stop Mike Myers' The Love Guru setting sail on a burning pyre down the Ganges. The Wachowski Brothers' Speed Racer crashed and burned in its opening weekend, and Mulder and Scully's X-Files return was the victim of an audience abduction.</p> <p>It's the next generation of starlets who'll be belt-tightening. With the biggest parts claimed by the biggest stars, it's crucial they stand out. So once the essential passports to fame - teeth bleaching, acting coaches, elocution lessons, personal trainers - have been paid for, the D-list will be defecting from Disney to McDonald's to make rent. </p> <p>In the last 12 months, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons has reported a drop in demand of up to 40%. The spiralling costs of laser eye correction, dental surgeons and breast implants means the lineup of rising young stars is likely to be littered with the partially sighted, flat-chested, and crooked of tooth: more Ugly Bettys than Ugly Coyotes.</p> <p>And spare a thought for the Hollywood seniors. Mel Gibson had God on his side when he funded The Passion Of The Christ from his own pocket, earning an almighty $611million worldwide. But God had clearly watched The Postman and Waterworld and took a holiday when Kevin Costner decided to blow $21m on his latest project, political comedy Swing Vote. The risk might have paid off had the film not been so dire, scraping just $12m in two weeks from the very bottom of the box-office barrel.</p> <p>The recession has also sucker punched independent film-makers. Low-budget flicks like Juno and Little Miss Sunshine may have cost pennies - well, under $8m - to make and reaped $100m-plus rewards, but they're few and far between, so financers are less willing to take a chance. Since 2004, $13bn has poured into Hollywood from hedge funds and investment banks to most of Hollywood's big studios. But the crunch has built a dam on this river. After Paramount tried to close a $450m financing deal with Deutsche Bank to offset the cost of 30 upcoming movies, the bank was unable to syndicate the senior debt part of the funding so the deal came to a halt, leaving many projects in the lurch.</p> <p>\"There isn't as much money out there to make films, so studios are making less,\" adds Stuart Kemp. \"They're handpicking them and dedicating a shorter time to pre- and post-production which are traditionally the most expensive moments in a film's life.\"</p> <p>And, while US adult DVD rentals and sales were up by 16% in 2007, Hollywood's porn stars are down in the mouth. Sales have slumped as aficionados are choosing to log on to get off for free.</p> <p><strong>The future</strong></p> <p>... is in nostalgia, remakes and rehashes. Put it this way: if Sylvester Stallone can successfully wring out sequels to lame ducks like Rambo 3 and Rocky 5, don't be surprised if they start releasing Harry Potter films chapter by chapter, not book by book.</p>",
  "<p>In June, Hampshire beat Durham in Chester-le-Street by four runs in a match they nearly contrived to lose after being in control. Yesterday they did it the other way round, pulling off an extraordinary victory after being thoroughly outplayed on the first two days of a match which could turn out to have been as vital to their prospects of avoiding relegation as it may have been fatal to Durham's of winning their first County Championship.</p> <p>The Hampshire hero was Sean Ervine. Like a number of his team-mates, the Zimbabwe-born all-rounder has not enjoyed the best of seasons but his 94 not out off 169 balls was a remarkable effort of concentration on a pitch which, though easing, was still taking both seam and spin. </p> <p>Resuming on 26 out of a total of 108 for five, still 132 runs short of victory, Ervine had to ride his luck - particularly when he was caught behind off a Graham Onions no-ball on 64 - but for the most part he played with admirable circumspection, leaving as much as he could and picking up most of his runs off his legs, with only the occasional booming cover drive relieving the tension that built up around the May's Bounty ground as the target got ever closer.</p> <p>The Hampshire lower order responded, especially Liam Dawson, whose partnership of 94 with Ervine was comfortably the highest of the match. David Balcombe, the captain, Dimitri Mascarenhas and Imran Tahir also got their heads down. </p> <p>Durham, for whom Mark Davies was again the outstanding bowler, did not help themselves by dropping two straightforward catches, Shivnarine Chanderpaul putting down Dawson at slip off Onions, a straightforward chance when the score was 140, and Callum Thorp shelling Mascarenhas off Paul Wiseman when the score was 193. </p> <p>Davies pegged away, bowling Mascarenhas with a beauty and having Balcombe caught behind to give him match figures of 11 for 75, but Durham's coach, Geoff Cook, did not try to hide his disappointment. \"We didn't score as many as we should have done in our second innings, but 240 was defendable,\" said Cook, who believes two wins from their final four games may still be enough for Durham to win the title. </p> <p>Just one win will keep Hampshire up now, and the fighting spirit they have shown recently suggests it should not be beyond them. \"When Imran hit the winning runs it was the best feeling I've ever had playing county cricket,\" said Mascarenhas. \"To be bowled out for 96 in our first innings and come back to chase down 240 was a superb effort and, though the wicket did get a little better, Davies was still bowling brilliantly and Sean played an unbelievable knock. The ball was still beating the bat but you make your own luck and we fought really hard.\"</p>",
  "<p>Two former generals were sentenced to life in prison yesterday for the murder of a senator during Argentina's seven-year military dictatorship.</p> <p>Retired generals Antonio Bussi and Luciano Men\u00e9ndez were found guilty of kidnapping, torturing and murdering Senator Guillermo Vargas Aignasse.</p> <p>Vargas Aignasse disappeared on the day of a military coup on March 24 1976. The military later said it had released him from prison, but he was never seen again.</p> <p>Judge Gabriel Casas described the generals' actions as \"crimes against humanity.\" He read the verdict to cheers from the courtroom audience in the northern city of in San Miguel de Tucuman, where the victim was senator. Government estimates say between 13,000 and 30,000 people were killed in the purge on leftists.</p> <p>Argentine human rights secretary, Eduardo Luis Duhalde, praised the verdict. \"We are witnessing the end of impunity and the restoration of the truth, memory and justice,\" he said.</p> <p>Bussi, 82, will be allowed to remain under house arrest because he is over 75, a decision that enraged human rights activists outside the courtroom, who threw rocks and attacked police with sticks. Police used teargas to restrain the crowd.</p> <p>Men\u00e9ndez, 81, will remain in prison in another province, where he was convicted in July of human rights violations.</p> <p>After democracy was restored in 1983, Bussi was accused of kidnappings and assassinations, but an amnesty law prevented him from being prosecuted.

  "<p>Divorce rates in England and Wales are at their lowest for 26 years, official figures showed yesterday. Office for National Statistics research found the number of people getting divorced had fallen for the third year running, down from 12.2 divorces per 1,000 married men and women in 2006 to 11.9 in 2007.</p> <p>While the figure is the lowest since 1981, the number of twice-married men and women divorcing in 2007 had doubled over nearly 30 years. In 1980 one in 10 men and women divorcing had been divorced before, while the figure for last year was one in five.</p> <p>The research also showed more people aged 60 and over, and couples in their mid to late 40s, split up. In 2007 there were 2.3 divorces for every 1,000 men aged 60 and over and 1.6 for every 1,000 women. The 2006 figures were 2.2 divorces for every 1,000 men and 1.4 for women.</p> <p>Divorces in the 45 to 49 age group also increased, with more women than men getting divorced. In 2006 there were 14.9 divorces for every 1,000 married women aged 45 to 49, rising to 15.3 by 2007. For every 1,000 45 to 49-year-old married men in 2006 and 2007, 17.3 got divorced. </p> <p>Marilyn Stowe, of Stowe Family Law, said the rise in \"silver-haired divorce\" may be linked to longer and healthier life. \"People now have more energy in their later years and realise there is nothing left in their marriage once they have had their career and the children have left home.\" </p> <p>Stowe also suggested the recent economic crisis may have had an effect on divorce rates as \"people just can't afford to get divorced at the minute\". </p> <p>Robert Kerr, of Grant Thornton's forensic and investigation services, said the effect of high-profile \"big money\" cases such as Heather Mills' divorce from Paul McCartney and an increase in cohabiting could explain the fall in divorces. He said that at a time of economic uncertainty, perhaps couples wanted to try to resolve difficulties before considering divorce.</p> <p>Kerr said his firm's survey of 100 family lawyers revealed women petitioning for divorce received a more favourable settlement than men. \"It could be that husbands will think first before heading for the divorce courts, at least until the economic landscape settles, particularly as the housing market has been so badly affected in the last few months. Couples may think twice before divorcing and buying elsewhere.\"</p> <p>Relate cautioned against reading too much into the effects of the credit crunch on divorce figures. Jenny North, head of public policy for Relate, said: \"The reality is that couples split up in all economic climates as we have seen throughout our 70-year history. Families urgently need easy access to emotional support to manage the fallout from conflict when they separate.\"</p>",

  "<p>Yesterday, a \"highly placed source\" in Moscow was reported as saying the Kremlin intends to turn off the oil export pipeline to the EU on Monday, so great is Russian ire about the rhetoric in Brussels and warships in the Black Sea. If this is true, we are entering a whole new ball game in what has come to be called \"energy security\". Even if the report proves false, the west should be on red alert about energy export weaponry.</p> <p>Barely noticed in the runup to the crisis in Georgia, Russia signed a deal that gives its energy giant Gazprom control over gas supply from neighbouring Turkmenistan - one of three former Soviet satellite states around the Caspian sea on which Europe is pinning its hopes for a future gas supply. This Turkmen coup deepens Britain's possible energy dependence on Russia as North Sea production falls away. </p> <p>Coyly worded press releases on Gazprom's website shine a faint light on its Kremlin-driven machinations but stop short of illuminating the whole story. Gazprom is on its way to achieving dominion over Caspian gas, and the Kremlin is making overtures to the other states in the region, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. They in turn must be watching events in Georgia and wondering how they can refuse those advances.</p> <p>At the same time, Moscow is cosying up to Beijing on energy and security: Russia and China signed an energy collaboration treaty before the G8 summit, and their armed forces have conducted joint exercises. Caspian gas may yet end up heading eastward, not westward. Gazprom has already threatened to withhold gas exports from Europe should Brussels try to stop it buying up European gas firms. Ten EU states are already largely dependent on Russian gas.</p> <p>The Kremlin has a strategy to control a vast slab of the world economy via oil and gas. Dmitry Medvedev, lest we forget, used to run Gazprom. The Georgia crisis, if not a planned piece in the strategy, certainly fits. The EU intended to build a pipeline across the Caucasus, avoiding Russian soil, but the sudden unavailability of Turkmen gas, on top of war in Georgia, makes that unlikely now.</p> <p>In the oil sector, all the major companies have been drawn into the Kremlin's new great game. Shell has lost majority ownership of its vast Sakhalin project; Total has been reduced to the status of a services company; BP seems on the verge of having 25% of its reserves expropriated by Russian oligarchs. Would it be too cynical to suggest they might be acting as proxies for a company formerly run by the president? A company, it must be noted, that is actually quoted on the London Stock Exchange.</p> <p>The UK, meanwhile, has no energy strategy, and what plans there are will not come to fruition before the end of the next decade, when it will be too late to escape the Russia trap. We should be urgently embarking on a national clean-energy mobilisation. The government should create investment conditions that allow City capital to flow into efficient-energy technologies that can be delivered in short order.</p> <p>It is a strange kind of capitalism that takes pension contributions from people and invests them in an agency of a foreign power quoted on the LSE, despite the risk that pensioners will freeze because the foreign power delivers on threats to turn off the gas taps.</p> <p>We have technologies to rid ourselves of the need for gas. But we do next to nothing. Energy efficiency is low priority, and our renewable generators languish in cottage industries. Energy dependency could turn a new cold war red hot. Energy independence would allow east and west merely to trade insults. Let us start the independence movement in earnest, energy wise.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jeremy Leggett, founder and chairman of Solarcentury, is author of Half Gone <a href=\"mailto:jeremy.leggett@solarcentury.com\">jeremy.leggett@solarcentury.com</a></p>",
  "<p>At the end of the 1940s, my grandparents, Trevor and Mary Vaughan, were living in Epsom. Trevor was employed as a draughtsman; Mary was working at Chessington zoo. They were considering emigrating to Canada. Then, via her sister, a local brewery offered the young couple tenancy of a large Edwardian pub, the Lamb Inn, in Durrington, near Worthing, West Sussex. They never regretted the decision, and nor did their customers. During their three decades there, the Vaughans made the Lamb the hub of the community.</p> <p>Mary, who has died aged 88, shone as a landlady. She had an impeccable sense of style and a wicked sense of humour, and her hard work soon made her a firm favourite of the locals. She singlehandedly took on the Lamb's kitchen and created spectacular spreads for the many wedding receptions and parties she hosted.</p> <p>Born Mary Lougher in Pontypridd, Wales, she was one of 11 children. Her father, a cavalryman, had met his wife while stationed in Kilkenny, Ireland. She grew up in times of hardship and was educated at the local school. During the second world war Mary, along with several of her sisters, worked at the Royal Ordnance Factory in Llanishen. She loved dancing, and met my grandfather, Trevor Vaughan, at a local dance. They wed in 1946.</p> <p>In 1984 Trevor and Mary reluctantly retired from the Lamb after nearly 32 years. The pub has gone through many changes since and people still reminisce about the \"old days\". When Trevor began to suffer from ill health, Mary, although frail, looked after him at home, until his death in 2001. </p> <p>At the Lamb, Mary had welcomed with open arms family members arriving for summer holidays, and sometimes honeymoons.

She is survived by my father, Michael, and his brother, Paul, her daughters-in-law Christine and Joyce, and four grandchildren. And she will be missed by anyone who ever saw her smile behind the bar of that pub.</p>",
  "<p>I am in America, in my brother's boat, with my brother and two of my children. He has been pulling them around a cove on an inner tube all morning, and now he needs gas. We head into the harbour, where there is a gas dock.</p> <p>\"Why do you call it gas here, when it isn't a gas?\" asks the eldest.</p> <p>\"It's actually short for gasoline,\" I say. \"The gas part referring to the volatility of the liquid fuel.\" I have been doing this all week. The day before in a diner I offered them a quick treatise on the silver dollar pancake, so named because it is smaller than a regular pancake, ostensibly the size of a US silver dollar, although it isn't really, because that would be ridiculously small. I'm starting to convince myself that this counts as being bilingual.</p> <p>\"Slow down!\" screams someone. We look up to see a man who is filling his giant yacht with gasoline yelling at an even larger motor yacht which is coming into the harbour and, in contravention of signs, leaving a wake. \"You're going too fast!\"</p> <p>The larger yacht's engine suddenly dies, and then kicks into reverse. A large man appears at the stern. Like the first man, he is wearing a pastel polo shirt tucked into belted shorts.</p> <p>\"Don't tell me I'm going too fast, you asshole!\" he shouts. My children are transfixed by the argument. It's as if a scene from an American film is being rehearsed for their benefit, a film that will carry a 12A rating, if not a 15. So far there is nothing for me to translate.</p> <p>\"You got no business bein' on the water, pal!\" shouts the first man.</p> <p>\"This attitude is common in eastern coastal regions,\" I whisper. \"Nobody thinks anybody else has any business being on the water.\"</p> <p>\"Shush,\" says the eldest. The second man calls the first man a prick, and several threats are exchanged, although as my brother points out, it is difficult to kick someone's ass when you're on two different boats. Eventually the bigger boat moves off. The first man cups his hands round his mouth to shout after it. \"You're a fuckin' chooch!\" </p> <p>My children look at me expectantly. I look blank, and then look at my brother, who raises a quizzical eyebrow. Even the larger man, who cuts his engine again, seems perplexed.</p> <p>\"What did you call me?\" he shouts.</p> <p>\"You're a chooch!\" yells the first man.</p> <p>\"What's a chooch?\" asks the younger of the boys.</p> <p>\"Dunno,\" says my brother. \"But it's not good.\"</p> <p>Later that evening we are playing poker, eight or nine of us, adults and children, sitting around a glass-topped table in my father's living room.</p> <p>\"Deal, you chooch,\" says the middle child.</p> <p>\"Put in your chips, chooch,\" says the youngest.</p> <p>\"You probably shouldn't be using that word,\" says the eldest, \"until we find out what it means.\"</p> <p>\"I never hear this word chooch,\" says my Bulgarian brother-in-law.</p> <p>\"Just deal the chooching cards,\" says the middle one.</p> <p>Later I look up the word \"chooch\" on the internet, in secret, because my grasp of American English is not meant to require additional research, and also because I fear the answer may be obscene. One website says it's derived from the Italian word \"ciuccio\", meaning a child's dummy, but I suspect this is some kind of bowdlerised, 12A-rated etymology. That is not what the man meant when he called the other man a chooch.</p> <p>My brother's Italian friend Tullio informs me that ciuccio is also a Neapolitan dialect word for donkey. \"To call someone a chooch,\" he says, with tremendous authority, \"is like saying they are stupid, a moron.\"</p> <p>My children are visibly disappointed by this explanation, which robs the word of its mystery, and therefore its power. Later, when they believe that I am out of earshot, I can hear that they have returned to calling each other \"arsehole\".</p>",
  "<p>You can't judge a book by its cover, but it's not a bad place to start. The design of the fiction put out by John Lehmann in the late 1940s and early 50s had the louche swagger to complement an edgily cosmopolitan list: Jean-Paul Sartre, Saul Bellow, Gore Vidal, John Dos Passos, Paul Bowles. You could smell fierce French tobacco lingering on tanned pages and sample exotic locations filtered through fugues of premature sex tourism. The books looked good enough to frame, we took the contents on trust. And being by 1975 a trader in forlorn and forgotten literature, I slid copies of two London novels published by Lehmann under my stall, in the fond belief that the John Minton dust-wrappers would give them a market value at some unspecified future date.</p> <p>The novels were credited to someone called Roland Camberton. I set them aside: until the time was right to make the discovery that the most exotic location of all, the true heart of darkness, was on my doorstep in Hackney; a slack-waisted borough of which Camberton was the unrecognised laureate. Despite the gentile surname, he wrote within a recognised Jewish tradition: the unsentimental education, the investigation of a wider city and the breaking away from the clinging embrace of an orthodox family. Rites of passage involved expeditions to the real East End, before sticky experiments with Soho caf\u00e9s and clubs. Versions of this story with greater or lesser degrees of cynicism and panache would include Simon Blumenfeld's Jew Boy (1935), Alexander Baron's The Lowlife (1963), The World is a Wedding (1963) by Bernard Kops, Emanuel Litvinoff's A Journey Through a Small Planet (1972) and even Harold Pinter's The Dwarfs (1990). Naturally, the authors denied any familial connection and dismissed the lesser titles in the series as incompetent, fraudulent and not worth 10 minutes of any serious reader's time. Baron, more generous than the rest, was interviewed by Ken Worpole as background for Worpole's first book, Dockers and Detectives (1983). The Hackney author moved the discussion straight back to Lehmann. \"The people you speak of were all discoveries of John Lehmann, a part of his attempt to find a proletarian literature. This had its condescending side. There is, from Lehmann and his ilk, a homosexual attitude to the working class.\"</p> <p>Litvinoff confirmed this accusation when I talked to him for a film on submerged London writers in 1992. He recalled being invited, when still in uniform and heavy boots, to Lehmann's elegant flat, where the publisher was waiting, draped in a No\u00ebl Coward dressing-gown, drink in hand. There was a vampiric thirst for fresh blood, hard male prose, the subterranea of the city. Lehmann had other sources of income, shadowy business interests; publishing was a superior hobby, a way of meeting interesting young men. Much of the zest in English fiction comes from rogue individualists looking for new ways to lose money by leaving orphaned books for future scavengers to discover and promote.</p> <p>One of Lehmann's tricks was to pair off a modest working-class writer with a posh but troubled artist such as Minton. The zones where the tribes collided, in apocalyptic blind dates, were Soho and Fitzrovia. Moneyed dilettantes, professional scroungers and the thirsty dead: shoulder to shoulder, they fought for space at favoured bars. They worked much harder than nine-to-five civilians to promote their own legends, to the point where some other mug would write the book for them. The point, as Dylan Thomas and Julian Maclaren-Ross soon learnt, where you become an actor in the anecdote of a rival is the point where your words are no longer required. It's time to disappear. To play the final card: suicide by other means. The last train to the suburbs. Stiff nights on the bench in the Russell Square Turkish baths. Trembling hands failing to get cold coffee, unspilled, to scabby lips. Late-bohemianism is a career better recollected than experienced.</p> <p>Scamp, published by Lehmann in 1950, is Roland Camberton's first novel. It is set in Soho, Bloomsbury and Fitzrovia; in the rented rooms, pubs, all-night caf\u00e9s where the author could well have come across Minton and certainly did lurch against Maclaren-Ross. Ivan Ginsberg occupies a rat-infested bathroom-kitchen, while trying to scam the funds for a stillborn literary magazine. The cancelled cheque stubs of Camberton's own life are an audition for the real business: the manufacturing of fiction.</p> <p>\"Ginsberg found himself confronted with the type-writer . . . A story a day, that was his minimum task; two thousand words, preferably with a plot, development, a climax, and a twist. After six months of this routine, he was beginning to feel an intense hatred of the short story, in fact, of all writing. What an abominable occupation it was!\"</p> <p>Camberton's prose is feisty, but there is something fugitive about the Hackney writer: if he has broken away from his roots, he knows they will reach out to choke him. The novel is heady with the delusion of freedom, but it's on parole. Delivered like an over-researched thesis, Scamp is quietly triumphant about coming into existence, but crushed by the horrible labour of composition. Nobody wants a new recipe for oblivion.</p> <p>Maclaren-Ross reviewed Scamp with withering condescension: \"Mr Camberton, who appears to be devoid of any narrative gift, makes this an excuse for dragging in disconnectedly and to little apparent purpose a series of thinly disguised local or literary celebrities.\" One of whom, although he doesn't mention it, is Maclaren-Ross himself, lightly disguised as the \"former commercial traveller\" Angus Sternforth Simms. \"That he found time to write at all puzzled the little crowd of habitu\u00e9s which watched him and heard him every evening, with respectful animosity, at his corner of the bar.\"</p> <p>Other notices were more encouraging. Scamp won the Somerset Maugham award for 1951. Camberton was invited to the Ritz to be inspected by his lizardly benefactor. A friend wondered how they had got along. \"Oh, marvellous,\" Camberton reported. \"He asked if I wanted tea or whisky. And I said whisky. Maugham said, 'That's right, good show! I'm going to have both.' And then we put English fiction to the sword.\" Maugham left the judging of his prize to a committee. Kingsley Amis, the winner in 1955 and the dominant voice of his generation, was a writer against whom the old man nursed numerous prejudices. 'Boorish and provincial,' he said to Camberton: but, all too soon, the author of Scamp was drifting out of print and into Grub Street anonymity.</p> <p>The second book is always hard. Camberton, in choosing to set Rain on the Pavements (1951) in Hackney, was composing his own obituary. Blackshirt demagogues, the spectre of Oswald Mosley's legions, stalk Ridley Road Market while the exiled author ransacks his memory for an affectionate and exasperated account of an orthodox community in its prewar lull. Competing voices shout across a crowded kitchen where loyalty to family battles against hairball claustrophobia. The novel unfolds through a sequence of discrete but connected short stories, which fade away into sudden darkness; an untimely return to Poland, erasure, silence.</p> <p>I suspect that the character of Uncle Jake is a refracted self-portrait by the author. A midnight cyclist and compulsive autodidact, Jake wobbles between ideologies, short-lived enthusiasms. He taps on his nephew's window, asking to share the narrow put-u-up bed. Like Camberton, Jake decides to join the Royal Air Force. He has to get away from everything that makes him what he is.</p> <p>\"The family realised that the mystical cord which, for all his eccentricities, bound Jake to them and to all that was reasonable and normal, had snapped, cruelly, inexplicably, and unnecessarily. Jake was, voluntarily and alone, descending to the lowest section of society; he was going to become a homeless casual labourer, a tramp, a criminal even. A young man who had no money, no job, no home, no wife, no friends, was, in essence, a criminal.\"</p> <p>Jake's guilty secret is that, without letting friends or family know, he has published a novel. And its title is: Failure. There is a schizophrenic moment when David Hirsch, the narrator, opens the book written by Camberton's alter ego: \"With what strange feelings David opened the thin, ill-printed, yellow-wrappered volume. It was as though the past itself had been drawn, temporarily but without noticeable change, from the vaults of the museum.\"</p> <p>Then Camberton vanishes, nothing is heard from him again; he publishes no third book. Minton's dust-wrapper for Scamp takes on the jaundiced colouring of the uncut pages of Failure. A balding man, left hand in pocket, right hand gripping a furtive typescript, slouches down the cobbles; past the pub, out of the frame, into the wilderness.</p> <p>I asked Patrick Wright, who had befriended Litvinoff and written very effectively about his work, what the acerbic old man felt about Camberton. \"He was totally dismissive,\" Wright said. \"Those two books, Litvinoff reckoned, had nothing to do with the East London he had known as a young man. They were opportunistic, banal. He preferred to remember Wolf Mankowitz. Now there was a man who knew how to make money.\" As to Camberton's later career, Litvinoff thought he had spotted him once, going into the offices of the Reader's Digest, but he couldn't be sure.</p> <p>Baron, put by Worpole to recalling the \"Jewish East End writers\" of his acquaintance, finished with the Litvinoff brothers. And then, after a long pause, he mentioned one more. \"Oh yes, I'd almost forgotten him: Roland Camberton. I saw him once at a party. I think, like Pinter and myself, he went to Hackney Downs School. I can't remember whose party it was, except that it was somewhere in St John's Wood. I didn't venture very often into these exotic territories. I had this little uneasy chat with Camberton, a strange man. That's it. That's all I know.\"</p> <p>And there it would have finished, with no more information than you could retrieve from the flap of one of Camberton's novels. Born in Manchester in 1921. Brought up in London. Served in the RAF as a wireless mechanic. Worked as teacher, copywriter, translator, tutor, canvasser, publisher's traveller. A future project, an autobiographical book called Down Hackney, is floated. But nobody I have spoken to has ever seen a typescript.</p> <p>The nagging mystery was one of many I worried at, up to the point when I started work on my own memoir, a documentary-fiction called Hackney, That Rose-Red Empire. I projected a connection with the author of the book-within-a-book, Failure. Camberton's topography, his questing excursions, haunted me, becoming, in their fashion, a kind of model. \"It was necessary to know every alley, every cul-de-sac, every arch, every passageway; every school, every hospital, every church, every synagogue; every police station, every post office, every labour exchange, every lavatory; every curious shop name, every kids' gang, every hiding place, every muttering old man . . . In fact everything; and having got to know everything, they had to hold this information firmly, to keep abreast of change, to locate the new position of beggars, newsboys, hawkers, street shows, gypsies, political meetings.\"</p> <p>Amen! Huzzah! My mad creed in a single paragraph.</p> <p>Having absorbed Hackney, its lost rivers, demolished theatres and built-over market gardens, Camberton's continued existence was tautologous: he had become the spirit of place. And through place, miles walked, he was to be recovered. Or so I excused my failure as literary snoop, uncommissioned private eye. Until, in the most unexpected way, the name of the vanished writer jumped out at me. A slender booklet, Walking the London Scene (Five Walks in the Footsteps of the Beat Generation) by Sydney R Davies, dropped on my doormat. Here was permission for a jug of coffee and a rest from my researches. I followed with interest the story of how a person called Douglas Lyne, described as an \"archivist and Chelsea habitu\u00e9\", met William Burroughs. They drink together. Lyne lends Burroughs a pound. Returning from Tangiers, the notorious junkie repays the loan. A line of double brandies is fired back in celebration. When the two men meet again, in a pub called the Surprise, they are joined by a third: Henry Cohen. Lyne decides that they will go back to his flat and make a recording on a creaking reel-to-reel machine.</p> <p>They are now, all three, quite drunk. The man from the pub, Cohen, the one who will operate the recording machine, was himself, years ago, a published writer. That might have been the source of his irritation. His books were classically constructed, widely reviewed and completely forgotten. To hide the shame of his alternative career from his strictly religious family, Cohen took another name: Roland Camberton. This Chelsea night must have been one of the most fantastic conjunctions in literary mythology: like a posthumous nightmare for Maugham. Burroughs, the hierophant of fractured modernism, interrogated by a champion of the local, the specific, Hackney picaresque.</p> <p>Naturally, I had to track down the tape. It became a grail, all of my interests converging on a single elusive object. I made contact with Davies and he arranged a meeting, south of the river, a long way from Chelsea, at the house where Lyne now lived. Lyne was a person adrift in memory, calling up anecdotes of military life, intertwined with genealogies of the Welsh Marches and musings on the rogue priest, Father Ignatius, who raised a girl from the dead in Wellclose Square. He was a charming and discursive anecdotalist, the years in pubs and clubs had not been wasted. He wouldn't be deflected, by my Camberton probings, from the unravelling of an invisible thread. There were mugs of slow tea and many chocolate biscuits. Lyne, with his swept-back silver hair, trim moustache, milky eye, was like a benevolent General Pinochet.</p> <p>Roland Camberton - or Henry Cohen, as he had known him - was one of his closest friends. Lyne moved in the post-war Soho world of documentary films and drinking clubs where he mingled with writers, painters, adventurers on the lookout for new islands. \"Johnny Minton was one of us. He did the covers for Henry's books.\"</p> <p>The first meeting between Lyne and Cohen was in Chelsea at the Pier Hotel. \"All the local mandarins were lolling about,\" Lyne told me. \"Dregs and real dregs. With the great Henry. Who was an extremely distinguished-looking Jewish man. Like a great composer. Huge brow. We drank and we chatted away. We bought - it must have been me - a bottle of wine. And we went back to Henry's room. He said: 'I've just won a prize. Somerset Maugham has given me \u00a3500.' Maugham thought Henry was a good storyteller. And he was right. Henry could do colourful characters. He had great warmth. He loved listening to what you had to say, but he didn't like wasting his time doing practical things.\"</p> <p>And so, inch by inch, a narrative of the lost years was teased out. Cohen learnt to write in the air force. \"When I had a spare moment in the office,\" he told Lyne, \"I would scribble bits and pieces and read them out at lunchtime and see who laughed at which passage. I was quite surprised, they liked my stuff. But the bits I liked they found high-fallutin' and boring.\" Coming across an article by Lehmann in which he said that he was searching for English authors with the urban fizz of Saul Bellow, Cohen decided to make an approach. He took his RAF gratuity and moved west. \"I was spending all my time in Soho. Living it up as far as I could. Drinking. Courting the girls. I'd come from a stuffy orthodox Jewish background. I found Soho life fascinating and I thought other people would want to hear about it. I wrote Scamp. And I remembered John Lehmann.\"</p> <p>After Scamp, there was talk of a film. But nothing happened. Cohen produced some journalism for trade magazines. He kept his head resolutely down. \"You couldn't say that's what Henry was doing, freelance journalism,\" Lyne reported. \"You couldn't ask. Henry wasn't a man who did things. He just ran out of ideas. I should have learnt more from him. I didn't take him seriously. I think he had an interior purpose. He hated to be known. He was a very secretive person.\"</p> <p>The pseudonym Cohen adopted was resolutely non-Jewish. He cast himself as a matin\u00e9e idol rescued from some forgotten Hollywood programmer witnessed at the Clarence in Lower Clapton. Ronald Colman, Madeleine Carroll and Roland Camberton in The Prisoner of Zenda: such was the fantasy. The reality of this grubbing, scratching postwar era was membership of a literary underclass described by Maclaren-Ross (in a letter to Lehmann) as being made up of those who \"live like rats among the ruins which they themselves have helped to honeycomb\".</p> <p>The family didn't give up on the decamped eldest son. Lyne remembers an afternoon in his studio flat. \"This very Hatton Garden sort of chap came around. He had a set of sacrificial knives which he used for cutting animals' throats. Henry jumped up. 'This is my brother.' The brother said: 'I've come to bring you home to Hackney.' Henry told me that the same scene happened every week. His father was ill.\"</p> <p>Lyne got married, changed pub, lost touch with his friend. Years later, in Soho, he bumped into Henry again. \"He was with a very attractive woman. I think he must have been knocking about with her for quite a long time. She was very gentile, very county. Enormously devoted to him in a distant kind of way. She didn't like being associated with Soho or drink.\"</p> <p>Cohen said that things were going rather well. \"She's got lots of money. She wants to get married. She's got a house, with hunting and that kind of thing. I go down there. My family have cut me off, they don't want to see me. I can't go on. I don't really have anything to do.\" Roland Camberton had grown into the situation that befell Uncle Jake in the novel written so many years before. \"He lost touch completely with the family . . . their relationship was quietly wrapped up, as it were, placed in the cupboard of limbo, and locked away.\"</p> <p>Ducking and diving, Cohen had the painful task of reading other people's novels for MGM: could they be turned into films? He brought Lyne onboard - and Lyne, in return, set Cohen up with a trial, writing copy for EBIS (Engineering in Britain Information Services). \"What's this fellow done?\" said the boss. \"A picaresque Soho novel and a book about Hackney.\" \"Good God! I can find 20 people to write picaresque novels about Hackney. I want someone who writes dull-as-ditchwater technical material.\"</p> <p>At the end of Cohen's first month, Adrian Seligman, who ran the operation, told Lyne they were going to have a big party. \"What are we celebrating?\" \"Henry's departure. He's a marvellous writer, but it takes him weeks to polish a paragraph.\"</p> <p>After this setback, news of Cohen came by way of an accountant, Leslie Periton. Periton was a partner in the firm of AT Shenhalls, who represented Terence Rattigan, Benjamin Britten and Leslie Howard. Lehmann persuaded them to take on the promising young winner of the Somerset Maugham award. Periton and Lyne had lunch together, once a year. \"Henry was exactly the type Periton wanted,\" Lyne said, \"a man who didn't have any interest in making money. Periton probably got him the job at MGM to keep him afloat. Nobody knows if Henry ever wrote anything else under another name. My view is, at the times I ran into him, he was a declining person. He had problems with his inamorata.\"</p> <p>At one of these epic lunches, somewhere in the mid-60s, Periton said to Lyne: \"It's all up.\" \"What's happened?\" \"Henry's not so good. In fact, he's dead.\" Nobody knew the details, aorta, aneurism. Showing me his inscribed copy of Scamp, without the Minton dustwrapper, Lyne was visibly moved. \"Accumulated memories do work their way to the surface. I have a notion Henry married his lady. They had a child. It could be a whole new chapter in Henry's story.\"</p> <p>From time to time, in a half-hearted way, I tried to interest publishers in bringing Camberton back into print. I was an admirer of the series of London Books Classics being put out by John King and his partners. In considering Rain on the Pavements they made the usual attempts to find the person who held the copyright and they came up with a name: Claire Camberton. Could this be the child mentioned by Lyne? I was given Claire's details and a meeting was arranged.</p> <p>A woman with bright eyes, animate but tentative, arrived on my doorstep, dragging a large red case on wheels. She was, as she told me, no stranger to Hackney. She brought reams of documentation, photocopies of letters, snapshots, books: the fruits of 20 years' research. She was astonished to meet another Camberton enthusiast and we were instantly exchanging snippets of information, trying to fit the jigsaw together. Claire was indeed the daughter of Henry Cohen, but not the child of the late marriage. Her story was unexpected and poignant.</p> <p>\"I was born in December 1954. My mother's name was Lilian Joyce Brown. She was from Andover in Hampshire. She lived in London during the war, working as a silver-service waitress at the Savoy. She was three years younger than my father. She died 20 years ago at the age of 64. She was a bit reclusive towards the end of her life and fairly secretive too.\"</p> <p>Lilian Brown met Henry Cohen when she attended one of the evening classes he gave, in short-story writing, at the City Literary Institute in Covent Garden. Lilian, her daughter recalls, was a pretty woman who was frustrated by her lack of formal education. She had a sharp eye for antiques and secondhand books and she haunted street markets. Very soon an affair was under way: \"Mum liked Jewish men; it was a bit rebellious at the time. My father pursued her and chatted her up. Mum told me, in her rather prim way, that he was very virile.\"</p> <p>They came to an arrangement: she would carry Cohen's child and, after giving birth, hand her over. Cohen's mistress of the moment, a Jewish woman, couldn't have children. Claire's mother moved to London, Thornton Street on the Stockwell-Brixton border, and she received an allowance of \u00a326 a month from Cohen's solicitors. She changed her name by deed poll to Camberton. Life in those ground-floor flats, as Claire remembers it, consisted of \"plastic knives and forks and making do\". The Camberton pseudonym had a simple explanation. \"My father made the name up by combining Camberwell and Brixton. He hated them both. He hated coming south of the river. He was very proud of the fact that he lived in Chelsea.\"</p> <p>Lilian decided to keep the baby. A terrible scene ensued, the last time the infant Claire saw her father. \"It was all Hollywood then. Everything was a story, a romance. When mum decided to call herself Camberton, my father slid away. He ended the association.\" The estranged couple met on Clapham Common in 1956. \"My father produced a huge stack of legal papers and presented them to my mother. Isn't that dramatic? I was in the pram. That was their final parting, the end of the relationship. There was no further point of contact.\" It was like a replay of an image from Graham Greene's Clapham Common novel of secrets and betrayal, The End of the Affair.</p> <p>As Claire pointed out, the character Margaret in Scamp seems to be a guilty memory of her father's relationship with Lilian Brown; even though Scamp was published before her parents met. \"It's a melodramatic plot line,\" Claire said. \"She's three months pregnant and she kills herself. The whole theme is right there: a woman who is not of his class, not in his league, and having a child. That's probably why he didn't want my mother to read it.\"</p> <p>Scamp presents an anti-hero, Ginsberg, who courts failure, relishes obscurity, and has an eye for a waitress. \"Ginsberg was very much aware of her desirable presence by his side; so delightful were her little moues and winks that he . . . felt like . . . whispering into her ear an invitation.\" There was another woman in reserve. \"Until Lolita became his mistress, Ginsberg was delighted with the novelty of this courtship. But afterwards there was nothing to sustain their relations except recrudescent desire . . . Ginsberg was also still ashamed of Lolita's background, which, though it might supply colour for an adventure, an anecdote, made a long-term affair impossible. At the same time he was ashamed of being ashamed . . .\"</p> <p>Among Claire's papers was a photocopy of \"Truant Muse\", an article by June Rose published in the Jewish Chronicle in 1965, just before Camberton died. Rose wanted to discover why certain writers \"whose names were once well known . . . sped into obscurity\". Cohen, she decided, was \"the kind of individual who finds it pleasant to vegetate\". He retreated to a bungalow beside the sea. \"London history is his special subject and he writes with erudition and clarity in small reviews.\" The article is accompanied by a photograph: a balding, melancholy man. Like a cinema organist after the coming of sound. Here, without question, is the stalking figure drawn by Minton for the cover of Scamp. That image is taken from life.</p> <p>And there is one more surprise: a \"major work\", never published, Tango. The journal of a hitch-hiking odyssey around Britain, an English On the Road. \"The writing is at times Orwellian,\" Rose enthuses. Camberton laid out his plans in a letter to the Jewish Chronicle. \"My intention is to make two journeys: one, partly on foot, through Europe . . . and the second to North America.\" Tango was rejected by his publisher and has not resurfaced.</p> <p>\"Roland Camberton is essentially an isolated figure,\" Rose concluded. \"A man in a mackintosh, dignified, anonymous, alone. He is isolated from other writers, from the Jewish community . . . and his essential anonymity implies almost an element of choice.\"</p> <p>A firm of Wimbledon solicitors informed Claire's mother that Cohen had changed his name a second time, shortly before his marriage. The new name was never to be revealed. The allowance would stop. The site of the grave would remain a secret.</p> <p>I had been chasing the wrong story. Dying at the age of 44, Ronald Camberton left behind books that are worth searching out, as well as the lost manuscript of a journey on foot across Europe. At that point in my own life, I had scarcely begun; a bookseller in Uppingham was considering taking a punt on my first eccentric novel. I had lived in Hackney for 20 years without becoming part of its dream.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Iain Sinclair's Hackney, That Rose-Red Empire will be published by Hamish Hamilton in February next year.</p>",
  "<p>\"You can't conceive the ridiculous rage there is of going to Newgate,\" Horace Walpole wrote in 1750, as he marvelled at the well-heeled voyeurs of both sexes who flocked to the prison to gawp at the highwayman Maclaine before he was hanged. We remain incredulous about hanging people for what would now be thought small offences, and the casual brutality of the execution crowds who watched them in past centuries still shocks. Yet the rage of \"going to Newgate\" in effect continues. In the past decade, some dozen romping anecdotal compendia have been published about the poor wretches imprisoned in Newgate and hanged at Tyburn, where Marble Arch is now. Start with the Newgate Calendars of the 18th century, and it's clear that Kelly Grovier's book is the latest in a long line of such products. Publishers' belief in the market for them is unflagging.</p> <p>Newgate was an awesome phenomenon, and it did loom over London's imagination as well as its heartland for centuries. Despite its near-windowless walls, you could smell its deep stink as you walked past outside. Inside its squalid labyrinths over the centuries all manner of men awaited the noose or the flames - from Catholic martyrs to Captain Kidd and Jack Sheppard, highwaymen and murderers. Marlowe, Nashe and Ben Jonson spent bleak times in the prison; Dr Johnson and Dickens wrote about it. Like so many of his predecessors, Grovier salivates over gaol fevers, faeces, manacles and hangmen, and deplores the casual justice or political interest that sent people to their public burnings or stranglings. Like them, too, he invites us to be \"appalled\", \"mind-boggled\" or \"stomach-turned\" by these past horrors. Trading in sensation no less than Newgate Calendars did, he never once pauses to interpret what he finds. If his work differs from those earlier volumes, it is in its complacency about our own modern humanity: nothing today could possibly be as bad as that past was, Grovier's subtexts suggest.</p> <p>But in what senses is this true? Like all such compendia, this one stops just when the really interesting questions begin - rather as if Foucault and scores of hard-working historians thereafter never lived. For this is yet another book that cheerfully bypasses the complex meanings of English punishment which historians have been debating for the past 40 years. No effort is made here to grapple with the ways in which past assumptions about the felonious body and its symbolism validated cruel punishments in their own time and made them intelligible and bearable to watchers. Ignored, too, are the processes of state-formation that have determined the characteristics of an era's penal system and that still determine them. It is the modern state's hugely enhanced capacities to control, detect and punish far more offenders than ever quaked inside Newgate that explain why it no longer needs to hang those few who used to be caught. A million disciplinary pinpricks deliver stronger effects than a single throttling. If we are more \"humane\" than past generations, it is in some degree because we can afford to be so.</p> <p>Grovier comes to Newgate self-taught, it seems, and there's nothing wrong with that. But there is, accordingly, a hit-and-miss quality about the stories he tells; his book is footnote-free; and many of his cited sources are eccentric, dated, or simply unused. The source he cites most often is the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, perhaps not surprisingly. If you type \"Newgate\" into the ODNB's search-box, you bring up 646 references to that place, and Grovier follows up many of these, helping to shape his book correspondingly.</p> <p>His text can match Peter Ackroyd's for overwritten whimsy: \"For centuries the Gaol was the grimy axle around which London slowly twisted,\" he tells us; after Dickens visited Newgate in 1835, \"the English imagination would never be the same again\". He gets things wrong, too - or dodges questions about things he gets nearly right. Neither the Oxford English Dictionary nor Eric Partridge's dictionary of slang and cant endorses Grovier's unfootnoted claim that the phrases \"pulling your leg\" or being \"left in the lurch\" were first coined at or on the way to Tyburn. G\u00e9ricault's 1820 sketch of three men awaiting their deaths is not provably of the five Cato Street conspirators. It's not true that \"history\" has \"blurred\" the Gordon rioters of 1780 \"into a mass of destructive opportunists\": George Rud\u00e9's research long ago scotched that easy view of the \"mob\". It is not self-evident that Wilberforce, Elizabeth Fry and Dickens were on the angels' side when it came to abolishing hanging: what the first two wanted was an orderly prison regime that would bring the felon to true penitence before hanging, and what Dickens wanted (he watched executions avidly) was a watching crowd that was better behaved.</p> <p>It's a pity that the gap between academics' and lay writers' understandings should still yawn so wide. All the same, the labour that has gone into this book is impressive, and one must admire the chutzpah of an author who makes so vast a subject his own. As story follows story over centuries, Grovier does deliver one effect that a more academic work could never deliver. By the end, one simply has to agree that Newgate was \"the pre-eminent theatre in which the capital's dramas unfolded\" - the enduring centre of sensation, horror and retribution. This is worth saying - yet again. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Vic Gattrell's City of Laughter: Sex and Satire in 18th-Century London is published by Atlantic.

  "<p>What kind of relationship did Tony Blair have with fruit? From Peter Stothard, who shadowed Blair for his book 30 Days, we learned much about its vital role in the approach to the Iraq war. \"Tony Blair looks down at the fruit bowl, takes a green apple and chews it very slowly.\"</p> <p>And David Cameron? What characterises his fruit-eating style? We are obliged to Dylan Jones, who spent a year following the Tory leader around for Cameron on Cameron, for evidence of a revealing difference between his approach and that of the last Labour leader. \"As he quickly munched his way through a banana and then an apple,\" Jones noted, as Cameron prepared for PMQs last year, \"the traffic thundered down the Embankment ... \"</p> <p>It's the little details that are so telling, isn't it? That, at least, is the principle behind fly-on-the-wall books in which a journalist is given privileged access to a politician, for much of which - since one cannot be asking questions all the time - the fly simply observes what the politician does, in order, as Jones puts it, \"to get to the very heart of what makes him tick\".</p> <p>More blessed even than Stothard, Jones spent a whole year as a fly, during which, excitingly for him, Cameron went from being written off as the latest Tory leadership embarrassment to being hailed as prime minister in waiting. But anyone wondering how much this extraordinary transformation is due to Cameron's talents, and how much he owes to the successive failures of Gordon Brown, would be advised to wait for a different book.</p> <p>This is partly Cameron's fault, since, in 2007 when he agreed to this experiment, it was plainly his intention to reveal nothing to Jones that was not already obvious or guessable from his extensive public appearances. It says much, in fact, for the man's prodigious self-confidence that, even at this early and unglamorous stage in his career, he anticipated public interest in more than 300 pages of Cameron trivia, table-talk, and non-personal personal habits: \"I've got digital radio,\" he volunteers, \"and they're incredibly easy to turn to stations and get wonderful reception ... \" </p> <p>Of course, Jones is more culpable for writing it down. Even if expectations of a fly on a wall are invariably low, since the insect in question will have been thoroughly vetted for loyalty and discretion, Jones compounds this inherent unreliability by being, as soon becomes evident, a hopelessly devoted groupie. More than insights, revelations and policy detail, Jones simply wants Cameron to love him back. </p> <p>\"I think you acquitted yourself very well on Jonathan Ross,\" wheedles this most besotted of bluebottles; \"You're very powerful when you are speaking in the House;\" \"You seem more confident than you've ever been.\"</p> <p>Not that this torrent of unconditional smarm makes the book valueless. Any journalist who has ever wondered, after some futile set-to, whether flattery might not elicit more revealing answers from a politician than interrogation will find the question decisively answered in Cameron on Cameron. \"One thing that the public admired you for,\" Jones oozes, on the subject of Derek Conway, \"was the swiftness with which you dealt with irregularities ... \" When Cameron, instead of blushing, just swats him away - \"I don't do these things on a whim\" - Jones sounds desperate: \"It was meant to be a compliment!\" \"Well, good,\" Cameron allows, with an unmistakeable air of, \"don't let it happen again\". </p> <p>If there is any theme unifying this offputting heap of old Q&amp;As, stale opinion polls, picked-over cuttings and unilluminating detail, it is a kind of doomed non-buddy story, not so much Sideways as Completely Tangential, replete with unshared references, crushed pleasantries and whatever is the opposite of banter - retnab? To begin with, one's sympathies are all with Cameron, as Jones, who has turned to the right in middle age (think of him as Alf Garnett trapped inside a metrosexual body) unctuously comes on to him in cars, trains, prisons - really, some of the most inappropriate places - seeking evidence of a brotherly bond. \"Have you seen the film Children of Men with Clive Owen?\" he pleads, not pausing for his cornered quarry to answer. \"It's set twenty-odd years in the future ... \"</p> <p>For Jones, even if he is always going to be beta double minus to Cameron's alpha male, there must have seemed reason to hope: even if they'd watched different films, the GQ executive and the quondam TV PR speak the same, watercooler patois, featuring \"long tails\" and \"big asks\". Gradually, however, Cameron's ungenerous stock responses awaken a twitch or two of sympathy for his hapless fan. Lacking both the will and the journalistic equipment to respond to yawnsome blandness with renewed demands for clarification (how, for crying out loud, will a Cameron government enforce the end of \"top-down state control\"?), Jones the style writer retreats, under stress, to doing what he does best: spotting brands. \"There was the white perforated kitchen roll\", he records, in a desperate, extended description of the Cameron kitchen, \"the John Lewis kettle, the Bodum cafetiere, the Fairy Liquid, the sticky jars of Marmite, the Waitrose marmalade and the plastic jars of sea salt.\"</p> <p>Someone else will have to ask Cameron, the author and object of this dull, faintly insulting PR exercise, if he thinks it benefited his own brand. Is it possible that his behaviour never departs, as this account suggests, from being a study in conscious, utterly businesslike composure? And if it did, could we rely on Jones, Cameron's bizarre choice of Boswell, ever to tell us? It's hard, in the end, to decide which of the two comes across as more untrustworthy.</p>",
  "<h2>Man who stole from train passengers gets M25 ban</h2> <p>A man who stole from passengers at London railway stations was yesterday banned from inside the M25 for two years. Peter Abbott, 46, grabbed belongings from overhead racks, leaving the trains before they departed, Southwark crown court heard. He was arrested after a coat and a wallet containing \u00a3685 were stolen from a passenger on a Waterloo to Paddington service on April 10. The theft was caught on CCTV. The court heard that Abbott had 44 previous convictions and a drug problem. He was given a six-month sentence, suspended for two years, and a 12-month supervision order.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>INLA accused after Belfast shooting</h2> <p>Republican sources last night linked the shooting of a North Belfast man to the Irish National Liberation Army, which is officially on ceasefire, despite police claims there was no paramilitary connection. The 40-year-old victim is recovering in hospital after being shot four times in the elbow, ankle and knees after three masked men entered his home in the republican Ardoyne district early yesterday morning. The house has been attacked before. Last March, a young girl escaped injury after a bullet shattered her bedroom window. Sinn Fein and the SDLP condemned the latest shooting. <br><strong>Henry McDonald</strong></p> <h2>Falling teenager saved by tree in cliff face</h2> <p>A teenager who fell more than 30 metres (100ft) down a cliff was saved when he landed in a tree halfway down. The youngster suffered a leg injury when he fell at Hope's Nose, Torquay, Devon, yesterday. The alarm was raised when he was spotted by a member of the public about 15 metres down the cliff face, a Brixham coastguard spokesman said. \"Luckily he had landed in the roots of a tree,\" said the spokesman. Coastguard teams from Berry Head and Torbay strapped the youngster into a stretcher and lowered him to the Torbay inshore lifeboat. He was then taken to Torbay hospital by ambulance.</p> <h2>'Last woman veteran' of first world war dies at 109</h2> <p>A woman believed to be the last surviving female veteran of the first world war has died, the Ministry of Defence said yesterday. Gladys Powers died aged 109 in British Columbia, Canada, on August 14. She was born in Lewisham, south London, and emigrated to Canada at the end of the war. Powers served with the Women's Auxiliary Corps and later the Women's RAF. Powers's death brings the number of remaining first world war veterans to three. They include Henry Allingham, 112, who served with the Royal Naval Air Service, and is believed to be Britain's oldest man. <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Grant delay may force poor students to drop out</h2> <p>Thousands of teenagers face delays in grants for the new term because of computer problems at the company administering them, the Guardian has learned. Colleges report that only a handful of 16 to 18-year-olds have had confirmation from Liberata of their educational maintenance allowances, which are worth up to \u00a330 a week. Labour set up the scheme to encourage youngsters to stay in education. Those from poorer backgrounds may drop out if the grant does not turn up in the first week of term, said Barry Hansford, chair of the National Association of Managers of Student Services. <br><strong>Peter Kingston</strong></p> <h2>August breaks records and will end in washout</h2> <p>This month was the most overcast August on record and will end in a washout, forecasters said yesterday. Thunder storms tomorrow will bring to a close the wettest August in the UK for four years and the least sunny since records began in 1912, according to MeteoGroup, a division of the Press Association. Forecaster Michael Dukes said: \"There has been a real lack of sunshine this year. It has been the dullest since the early part of the 20th century. We have only seen around 90 hours of sunshine. The average for this time of year is 200.\" More showers are predicted for the first week of next month. <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Three remanded over alleged plot to kill Brown</h2> <p>Three men were remanded in custody yesterday following an alleged threat to assassinate Gordon Brown and Tony Blair in a posting on a jihadi website. Ishaq Kanmi, 22, was charged with soliciting murder, being a member of al-Qaida, and encouraging others to join. At City of Westminster magistrates' court, London, Kanmi was also accused of spreading terrorist literature along with Abbas Iqbal, 23, who was also charged with owning terrorist material. Iqbal's brother Ilyas, 21, was accused of possessing terrorist material and conducting research into terror. All three are from Blackburn, Lancashire. <br><strong>James Orr</strong></p>",
  "<h2>The winner</h2> <p>For 20 years my husband has held on to a small, tarnished silver cup. Wherever we move, this ageing relic follows. \"What is it, Dad?\" asks our 11-year-old daughter. It turns out that, in 1975, my husband had been crowned King Crab of Cemaes Bay after winning the annual crabbing competition in the most northerly town in Anglesey.</p> <p>The rugged resort was where my husband and his four siblings spent every summer. Unlike our own four offspring. Their summers have been spent in France, Italy and Spain. But the credit has crunched and a UK holiday beckons. Cemaes Bay it is.</p> <p>We pick up the keys for the Studio Cottage from the landlady of Ye Olde Vigour pub. \"It can't be Cerys,\" gasps my husband. </p> <p>\"Paul, I don't believe it,\" she replies. \"How are you? It must be more than 20 years.\" </p> <p>A long conversation follows and I begin to feel cheered as she refers to holidaymakers as \"visitors\". And our children begin to believe the impossible - that their dad was once a boy. Three hours later after a marathon beachcombing session where we find crabs, mudskippers, baby lobsters, a baby eel and rock pools we head \"home\".</p> <p>The following day we visit the small pier and the harbourmaster's cottage to arrange a fishing trip. The waters are a little choppy but we manage to find our sea legs, and our 13-year-old swaps the thrill of a mobile phone beeping for the pull of a rod.</p> <p>Safely back ashore, my husband catches sight of a plaque commemorating the life of a local fisherman. He stops and is instantly transported back to the day of his father's funeral when he was just 13.</p> <p>The young boy found great comfort from the reassuring presence of several Cemaes Bay fishermen who had made the long trip to Liverpool for the service. The name on the plaque belongs to one of those men.</p> <p>We walk back along the headland to White Lady Bay, named after the rock in the shape of a woman's head.</p> <p>Past and present merge as we explore beaches, coves and caves. Our youngest two wade bare-chested through the River Wygyr, fishing nets in hand, like latterday Huckleberry Finns.</p> <p>Finally, the big day dawns. King Crab must face his toughest test. Our children are handed buckets and crabbing lines to challenge for the title.</p> <p>At noon the high tide rolls back to shore, seagulls scream overhead and five intrepid crabbers cast their lines. After a slow start there are two clear winners. Our 13-year-old and his dad. At 26 crabs each, there has to be a decider.</p> <p>A small crowd gathers and within seconds Joe feels a pull. Inch by inch he carefully pulls in the line before plopping the unsuspecting crustacean into the crowded bucket.</p> <p>We have a new champion. King Crab is dead. Long live King Crab ... until next year's rematch.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Studio Cottage (0151 929 3924).</p> <p><strong>Jane Gallagher</strong> has won a weekend for four in a tipi near Padstow with Cornish Tipi Holidays, in conjunction with Neals Yard Holidays.</p> <h2>Join the circus<br>St Tropez</h2> <p>An orderly queue of tiny, small-boned French children trotted up to the trampoline, performed a perfect star jump and landed neatly on the mat. \"Tres bien, princesse, tres bien!\" said Charley, the circus-school coordinator, to yet another impossibly cute French five-year-old. \"Et maintenant, James Bond!\"</p> <p>Poor James. Nine years old, more bruiser than ballet dancer, and suddenly having to live up to the expectations that people have of you when you share a first name with 007. </p> <p>But he didn't let the pressure get to him. He attacked the trampoline enthusiastically, threw in a half-hearted star jump, and landed firmly - possibly causing a few waves in the infinity pool nearby.</p> <p>Despite being built for the rugby pitch, James was hooked. Every morning, while the rest of us took our time over croissants, James and his sister, LouLou, went to learn tricks at the circus school.</p> <p>And that's the beauty of a Pierre et Vacances holiday: you get a lovely villa, and your kids - or your nieces and nephew, in my case - get to do all sorts of things that they can't do at home. Like hanging off a trapeze, or staring at French women's breasts.</p> <p>Topless sunbathing apart, the resorts are designed for families. Our resort at Les Restanques - close to pretty Port Grimaud and about 10km from the Maseratis and yachts of St Tropez - had three swimming pools, a kids' club and free entertainment in the outdoor amphitheatre (magic one night, Europop the next). </p> <p>We'd head out for dinner in Port Grimaud where the kids enjoyed ordering \"diabolo fraises\" - strawberry syrup with lemonade - and tried not to giggle when the man at the next table ordered a steak tartare. Memories of Mr Bean, struggling with his raw meat, ensured that 13-year-old Charlotte stowed her handbag safely out of the way.</p> <p>In the mornings, we'd all pretend to be asleep so that someone else would fetch the baguettes from the shop at the top of a very steep hill for breakfast. And James and LouLou? They were the stars of the show at the end-of-week circus school spectacular. </p> <p>Unfazed by the other kids' flashy displays, James had his finale all worked out. He simply ambled on to the stage - and gave us a twirl.<br><strong>Madeleine Redway, Leicester</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Pierre et Vacances village of Les Restanques du Golfe de St Tropez (00 33 4 94 55 60 00, <a href=\"http://www.pierreetvacances.com\">pierreetvacances.com</a>).</p> <h2>Highland games<br>Nepal</h2> <p>Eight tries to six when bad light stopped play. We were on a four-day trek in the Himalayan foothills, watching a rugby match between five English boys in our group and five Nepalese village boys. We were camping at 3,000ft and the English boys had just explained to the opposition how to play this bizarre game - using a burst volleyball. An audience of 36 Sherpas, a dozen parents and siblings and a handful of villagers all roared approval and cheered their home country. But what made the experience even more extraordinary was the campsite: a tiny piece of flat land on a rugged precipice. Across the valleys were ridges of thick tree-laden hillsides, the magnificent Annapurna range where griffon vultures soared on warm air currents. </p> <p>The trek never exceeded 3,000ft (thankfully, for those of us who think three laps of Sainsbury's should be an Olympic event), but it was enough altitude to experience the lush vegetation and endless rice terraces, and to meet the women who tend them.</p> <p>The Nepali people, particularly the Sherpas, were enthusiastic and humorous, cracking jokes about the basic toilet facilities, carrying kids in baskets, entertaining the troops with volleyball and cooking unbelievable meals. At one post-trek hotel we endured a breakfast of stale cornflakes with sour yak milk, followed by toast with pink bubblegum-flavoured jam (like something in a Roald Dahl novel) - but not when trekking. Here, breakfasts were porridge, scrambled eggs, pancakes and omelettes.</p> <p>The relative solitude of the countryside contrasted to city life in Kathmandu. We were expecting variety but there were so many people, so much traffic, so much noise, and poverty. Nepal provided an emotional experience for all of us. We weren't sure what to expect but we certainly never anticipated that a rugby match would feature in our once-in-a-lifetime experiences.<br><strong>Andrew Mackay, Settle, North Yorkshire</strong></p> <h2>Fringe benefits<br>Edinburgh</h2> <p>It is the last of 10 days in Scotland and we have driven all the way across it. We have seen hills and rivers, midges and seals, slept in a large number of beds, and now we are in Edinburgh.</p> <p>On the way into the city we see the zoo, and the kids exclaim with joy. Half-heartedly, I promise we'll visit, but first we must find the youth hostel. It's hot and we're hungry but then we see people in costumes, wigs and fancy make-up. The festival has started! All my life I've wanted to see it and now here I am with two young kids who want only to go to the zoo.</p> <p>We can't check into the hostel for three hours. \"Let's just go to the zoo,\" my partner says. The kids are ecstatic, I'm sad. But by chance we reach the Royal Mile and there they are: three men, two emitting high-pitched squeaks and one playing ... \"Your instrument, Mummy, look!\" Yes, an accordion. They are performing a play about penguins, I think, and opposite are three other musicians, one with a cello, and two bald guys playing violins and dancing the can-can. The kids are hooked. \"Can we see their show? And theirs?\" A man, covered with blood, drags himself along the pavement, while others comfort onlookers that he is merely a trained actor. A gorgeous vampire offers us Dracula on a bouncy castle. The zoo is forgotten. We want to see the shows, all of them. </p> <p>We go to one called Aluminum (sic) for which we are given free tickets by three lovely young people dressed head to toe in ... you guessed it. We carry shiny bits away with us and are - all of us - thoroughly pleased at last.<br><strong>Saskia Wesnigk-Wood, Brighton</strong></p> <h2>The singing baker<br>Tuscany</h2> <p>It was my last family holiday before my parents' divorce. We rented a villa in the hills south of Florence for a very regular holiday. We looked at the churches in Tuscany, ate gelato in Siena, even took a photograph \"leaning\" against the Tower of Pisa.</p> <p>However, our first night was definitely not ordinary. Arriving, shattered from Pisa airport, we met our landlord who introduced himself with a bunch of flowers and a female translator. He was the local baker, she said in English rather more quiet than his booming Italian. He gave us some bread to prove it.</p> <p>We just wanted to crash out, but our host, through his assistant, suggested we come to the church. \"He's going to sing.\" We climbed into our tiny, still unfamiliar hire car, and began a precarious, twisting journey around the hilltop to the church. </p> <p>It seemed as if the whole village had turned up, and we shuffled into the full pews near the back.</p> <p>Our host stepped in front of the altar, his bulging jacket and flushed cheeks now joined by a bow tie. Without any fuss, and accompanied by another villager on the piano, he began to sing opera. I don't know if he was the best tenor, but I do know that I was transfixed. I remained transfixed for his entire performance.</p> <p>That evening destroyed any cynicism I had about classical music. Clearly the best way to appreciate opera is to hear it sung by the local baker of a Tuscan village.<br><strong>Joseph Farthing, Aberdeen</strong></p> <h2>Extracurricular education<br>Crete</h2> <p>What's the first thing friends want to know about a family holiday in June? \"Did you have to pay off the head mistress to get permission to take your son out of school?\" No. I volunteered for five more years' tombola duty at the summer fair.</p> <p>Thirty minutes' drive from Chania airport, the village of Maheri (population 50) includes Roula and Costas, the owners of Kamares Village Houses, restored Cretan/Venetian buildings set around terraces of fruit trees on the side of a mountain. </p> <p>Our villa was equipped with a kitchen adjoining the garden with panoramic views north to the Aegean Sea, where we would dine under a vine-covered gazebo. </p> <p>These occasions were special enough with local dishes cooked to Roula's grandmother's recipes and home-grown fruit and vegetables along with locally caught fish. But the highlight was Sunday's Patatas Festival; a feast of potato dishes and mountain greens eaten while our host worked his way through three bottles of ouzo.</p> <p>The welcome extended into Roula's personal history as she took us for a guided tour of her birthplace, Chania. A tireless campaigner on environmental issues, she explained how the island has changed, and how her approach to tourism is intended to benefit the countryside and its people. Such mind-expanding breaks should be included on the curriculum. <br><strong>Nick Stockman, Brighton</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Kamares Village Holidays (00 30 282 1044 134, <a href=\"http://www.kamares-houses.gr\">kamares-houses.gr</a>). </p> <h2>Summer sails<br>Turkey</h2> <p>I'm swimming in azure water where we've anchored for the evening. The late summer sun is pressing a lovely deep brown tan into my back, when there's a loud bleat. A whole herd of goats plod out from the squat bushes on the shore, knock-kneed and curious, and start drinking from the water, not five feet away. Apparently they like the salt.</p> <p>Ten of us are on a Mediterranean adventure which started in Marmaris, where we met our crew from Zephyria Yachting along with the breathtaking luxury gulet, Zephyria II: 32m long, all polished, dark wooden decks, padded seats and tall, white sails. </p> <p>Captain Alf has a ponytail so is immediately dubbed Captain Jack Sparrow. The rest of the six-strong Turkish crew are a lovely bunch, all amused at our idea of fun (cocktails and pole dancing to Britney Spears).</p> <p>Everything was simple. Wake up whenever, breakfast, swim, sun bake, lunch, plus there was a speedboat with water skis and a wakeboard. </p> <p>The highly anticipated family cocktail hour rolled around at 6.30pm, and the evening meal featured delicacies such as smoked eggplant puree with a traditional lamb ragout or baked fish with wild rice salad. We drifted from bay to bay, up the coastline towards Bodrum, stopping where we pleased.</p> <p>But all good things must come to an end. As we were sulkily waiting for our ferry back to Kos, we saw the magnificent Zephyria II pull out of the harbour. We sighed and started to turn away, but saw a movement. The crew had come out and were waving, grinning away with Captain Jack at the helm. Then, with a quick salute, he was back to his job, navigating the endless stretch of the blue Aegean Sea.<br><strong>Simone Knox, London</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Zephyria Yachting (90 252 316 9432, <a href=\"http://www.zephyria-yachting.com\">zephyria-yachting.com</a>). </p> <h2>Sweet views<br>Ambleside</h2> <p>What I want from a holiday is sleep, cakes of all varieties, some soul-feeding walks and to get out of the parental role of nagging, tidying and organising. </p> <p>The result was an apartment in Ambleside with the cake factor supplied by Lucy's of Ambleside, which has a cafe, bistro and deli. Unexpectedly, the idea went down well with our five-year-old, Faith, due to pencil envy of her friend's Lakeland watercolour pencils, and the prospect of a balcony giving ample Disney princess re-enactment opportunities. </p> <p>One day, we set off up Cat Bells, chosen for the great view over Derwent Water and exciting scrambling without much preliminary slog. We got up there, puffed out and hot, and the sense of space and grandeur from the (nearly) top was fantastic; it also gave us a taste of what we may be able to do in the future. Not bad, as Molly (20 months) tolerates her backpack only briefly and is a keen walker - though usually not in the right direction.</p> <p>And getting out of our usual roles?

Eating termites and coming face to face with tarantulas, monkey, macaw, caiman, giant otters and tree frogs (sometimes in our beds) was an adventure our two children (Rachel, 9, and Liam, 12) still recount to their friends. </p> <p>Our Peruvian journey started almost three weeks earlier in Arequipa, a town high in the Andes under the constant gaze of the El Misti volcano. The children were fascinated but slightly saddened in the Museo Santury, when they came face to face with Juanita, the frozen ice princess - an Inca girl sacrificed on Mount Ampato in 1440.</p> <p>On Lake Titicaca we took a boat to the floating Uros reed archipelago. The houses have been made from reeds since the Incas, and we spent the night with a local family on Amantani island.</p> <p>In Machu Picchu the children moved up and down the site pretending, like Hiram Bingham, to be the first to discover this archeological treasure. We stayed in the wonderful Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel where 18 species of humming bird hovered around us while we walked through the cloud forest grounds.

A police spokesman in Antigua's capital, St John's, confirmed his dismissal: \"I have just spoken to him and I am hearing that he was fired.\"</p> <p>Nelson made a series of public complaints about a lack of resources at the Royal Antigua and Barbuda police HQ which, when he arrived, had no computers, functioning radios or running water.</p> <p>He was presiding over an investigation into the killing of Catherine and Ben Mullany, who were shot by an intruder at their beachside honeymoon cottage in the island's Cocos Hotel. Two local men were charged with the shootings last week. The death of the British couple brought the murder count this year to 11 on an island of 80,000 people.</p> <p>The Antigua Sun newspaper reported that the island's Police Service Commission was dissatisfied with Nelson's performance and that when he appealed to Spencer for more authority, he was sacked.</p> <p>Nelson told the Guardian this month that his officers had no torches for night patrols and that 18 out of the island's 45 police cars were out of service. He said police stations had leaking roofs and unusable rooms and that conditions for officers were \"worse than appalling\".</p> <p>\"It's insane to expect to reform a police department when you don't give them what they need,\" he said.</p> <p>The honeymooners were the first tourists to be murdered in Antigua since 1995. Two men - Kaniel Martin, 20, and Avie Howell, 17 - have been charged with murder, robbery and receiving stolen goods. Three women have been charged with related offences including conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.</p>",
  "<p>She hunts. She fishes. She was voted Miss Congeniality after winning a beauty pageant in her small town in Alaska. She is a mother of five and a churchgoer who says her favourite meal is moose stew.</p> <p>But the quality that may serve Sarah Palin best after being chosen by John McCain as his running mate yesterday may be the competitiveness and determination to win that earned her the name Sarah Barracuda for her sharp elbows as high school basketball player.</p> <p>Palin, 44, the first female governor of Alaska and the first woman on a Republican presidential ticket, has a life story that could make a conservative Republican swoon. But until yesterday even Palin thought it far-fetched that she could be a figure on a national stage.</p> <p>In an interview last month, she even let slip that she did not think the job of vice-president was very meaningful. \"As for that VP talk all the time, I'll tell you, I still can't answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the VP does every day,\" she told CNBC. \"I'm used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration.\"</p> <p>McCain is hoping his selection will help win over disaffected supporters of Hillary Clinton who might rally towards a woman candidate, and that Palin's reputation as an anti-corruption crusader could banish the aura of the past that hangs over his candidacy. </p> <p>Born in Idaho, Palin moved to Alaska as a child. She married her high school sweetheart, Todd Palin, who works on the oilfields and is a champion snowmobile racer. The couple live on a lake, own a float plane, and have raised five children. Their eldest son is in the army and is about to deploy to Iraq. Their youngest son is six months old and was born with Down's syndrome.</p> <p>She is a fierce opponent of abortion and same-sex marriage. She supports the death penalty and the teaching of creationism in schools. Palin is an enthusiast for the outdoors and a gun owner, and is opposed to environmental restrictions on drilling in Alaska. </p> <p>While virtually unknown to the average American before yesterday, Palin has been a rising star in political circles since 2006. She challenged the incumbent Republican governor, who was then under the shadow of a corruption scandal, in the state primary, and went on to beat her Democratic opponent - a rare bright light for Republicans in 2006 who were losing across the map.</p> <p>As governor, she has demonstrated a populist flair. She sold the official governor's plane and took commercial flights. She drives to work in the family Volkswagen Jetta. In an attempt to soften the burden on Alaskans of high petrol prices, she proposed giving every household a $100 (\u00a355) energy debit card. Palin has also tried to cut government spending, shutting down a bridge project that would have cost $400m.</p> <p>But she has a long list of political enemies. She is also under investigation into whether she intervened to sack a state trooper who was involved in a divorce and custody battle with her sister. Palin is alleged to have transferred the commissioner of public safety, Walter Monegan, to a job at the state alcohol board last month, after he refused to sack the police official. </p>",
  "<p>Anna Price and her brother recently found themselves quarrelling across the hospital bedside of their mother. Anna is 41, but the stresses and strains of caring for an elderly mother led them both back to the sibling rivalries of childhood. </p> <p>\"It surprised us both,\" recalls Price. \"Even my mother reverted to how she was when we were children, taking my brother's side - which was ironic, given that I was arguing that she should be able to choose her own type of care while my brother thought he knew better.\"</p> <p>There's nothing quite like the question \"What shall we do with Mother?\" to open up Pandora's box for adult siblings. Rosie Staal, author of a book by that very name, says, \"When your elderly parent becomes dependent on you, it very often leads to rifts between siblings, even when there has been no conflict for decades.\"</p> <p>She explains: \"It injects some very strong emotions such as tension and worry into the family dynamic, which are usually coupled with passionate views. One daughter might be strongly in favour, for instance, of homeopathic medicine and Father making his own decision about whether he should go into a home. Her sister might have more traditional views about medicine and insist that Father should go into a home immediately. Then another sibling might have an eye on inheritance and would be happy to do whatever is required to save money.\"</p> <p>Even if the type of care has been agreed on, siblings may find themselves squabbling over anything from visiting times to possessions to whether a childless sibling should do more than one who has teenagers.</p> <p>While researching her book, Staal found that, like Price, many adults are left astonished at the sibling fragmentation that can ensue. \"We don't always see eye to eye about things and have always had very different views,\" says Price, \"but it hasn't been like this before - not since we were children,\" adding that they've stepped straight back into the roles they had all those decades ago. </p> <p>Linda Blair, a clinical psychologist and author of Straight Talking, believes that reawakened sibling rivalry goes much deeper than simply wanting the best for the parent and feeling irked that the others are neglecting their responsibilities. \"Brothers and sisters, even in late middle age, can find themselves - often subconsciously - competing for their parents' attention and preference,\" she says. \"In fact, it can be brought to the fore when the parent is elderly. It's like it's their last chance.\"</p> <p>Contrary to what we might think, emotions don't know time, she says. \"You might become more complex in the way you deal with emotions, but your core feelings tend to stay the same. A parent getting older can remind us of that quite forcefully.\"</p> <p>Julie Fuller, 43, says her sister had long given up vying for their father's favour by the time he became elderly, but that her unresolved anger about it was the cause of their sibling tensions. \"After Mum died, my dad became very depressed and later attempted suicide, but my sister just took the attitude that he needed to pull himself together. She would snap at him, which would break my heart, although to an extent I could understand it because he was being hard work. But I think what was really happening was that she was angry with him and my mum because I was treated differently, as the youngest.\"</p> <p>Mary Cooper, 45, who has three siblings and an elderly mother, knows how she feels. \"My sister has all this anger about the way she was treated as a child by Mum that she seems to feel able to take out on her, now that Dad has gone. That worries me because I think she'll feel guilty when Mum's gone. But when I try to point that out, she just thinks I'm taking Mum's side.\"</p> <p>Cooper has the added burden of being forced to see her mother in a whole new light. \"I'm starting to think what was Mum really like? Is my perception of her correct? Was my childhood as good as I seem to remember? That's particularly difficult to deal with when I'm trying to care for her.\"</p> <p>While many elderly parents are devastated to learn of any sibling tensions that arise from their growing dependency, fearful of the break up of their family after they've gone, others - such as Cooper's mother - appear to play each of the siblings off against each other. \"So far, the four of us have managed to avoid arguing, but it has caused a strain between us at times. The other day, one of them suggested she get a certain kind of car and did all the research, but Mum went behind her back to tell another sibling she wanted a different kind of car. I think my dad absorbed a lot of this kind of stuff and sort of managed Mum, but he's no longer here.\"</p> <p>Dorothy Rowe, a psychologist and author of My Dearest Enemy, My Dangerous Friend: Making and Breaking Sibling Bonds, says her mother attempted to play her off against her sister even though her mother and sister both lived in Australia. \"My mother would write to me saying things like, 'Myra's trying to put me in a home. You must stop her.' My mother was trying to get me on side, but I didn't want to be on anybody's side. It took me right back.\"</p> <p>Rowe says that her relationship with Myra had always been strained, but by the time their mother died it was dire. \"Myra even blamed me for my mother's death. When she learned I'd received a letter from Mum posted that day, she concluded that if she hadn't gone out into the summer heat to the post box, she wouldn't have collapsed.\"</p> <p>Rowe believes that the healthiest sibling relationships occur where there is recognition that each of you is dealing with the care and potential loss of a different individual. \"Each of us sees our parents in a different light - often dramatically so - and that's essential to acknowledge and respect,\" she says.</p> <p>Judith Cameron, author of Caring for a Parent in Later Life, adds: \"I've come across so many people who've had tremendous arguments with their siblings about what their mother would want. Why not find out what she actually wants while she can still think clearly? I also think it's important to decide on power of attorney early on.\"</p> <p>Mike Bingham, the director of <a href=\"http://www.elderlyparents.org.uk\">elderlyparents.org.uk</a>, believes much sibling rivalry could be prevented if sisters weren't expected to do everything. \"Our research shows that in 72% of cases, it is a daughter who does the physical, practical, everyday caring, regardless of whether she has brothers,\" he says.</p> <p>\"My mother came to live with us in 2001 when she became very dependent, and even though my brother lived just 25 miles away, he used to come and see her about three times a year,\" says Gillian Roberts, 61. \"My relationship with him was never that strong, but it really started to deteriorate. I'd only call him if, say, our mother was unwell. For ages, he didn't even accept she was anything other than perfectly capable.\"</p> <p>Lizzie Heffer, 50, is more forgiving of her 53-year-old brother, but she still questions the way things have turned out. \"He'll phone my parents, who are both in their 80s, and say, 'How are you?' and my mum will invariably say, 'We're fine, darling,' and he'll put the phone down satisfied that they're OK. When I call, I'll say, 'What does OK mean? How is Daddy really? Do you have plans today? What are you eating tonight?' I need to know that Mum has something to look forward to in the next couple of days and that she's getting enough rest.\"</p> <p>As their parents' needs have grown, it's Heffer - who lives two hours' drive away - who is doing the hands-on caring, rather than her brother who lives just six miles away. \"It's not that my brother doesn't care. But he doesn't really accept that they're unwell and I've always been the 'carer' in the family.\" </p> <p>It should not be necessary to point out that some sons do the work too. David Caspall, 69, and his six siblings agreed on a rota to take care of their 92-year-old mother. \"It petered out,\" he says. \"I moved to live with my mother in London and only one of my brothers really helps me and he lives further away than most of the rest of them,\" says Caspall, who is supported by the Princess Royal Trust for Carers.</p> <p>Caspall believes it's significant that they weren't a close-knit family to start with. \"But I think the real reason our relationship is getting worse is because they are embarrassed about how little they do, and I think there's jealousy about my relationship with Mum, too.\" </p> <p>Caspall is particularly resentful of grand gestures from other siblings, one of whom he says turns up laden with flowers and presents just twice a year.</p> <p>Keith Cockell, managing director of the retirement community Richmond Villages, sees many siblings in a state of denial: \"The biggest areas of denial are depression and mental illness. A lot of people can't acknowledge it's happened to their parent, who they've always seen as in control. That can be frustrating for another sibling who does accept it and needs their support.\"</p> <p>Cockell says that in most families, there is a lead sibling who feels more morally obligated towards the parent. \"The problem with this is that the others often wind up feeling guilty and jealous and that mix of emotions can in itself lead to difficulties.\"</p> <p>Then there's the ugly area of inheritance. \"Some people think they might miss out and get suspicious of the sibling who's taking on the responsibility of caring. That is very common. I'm always surprised by how mercenary people can be about inheritance.\"</p> <p>Then there are possessions. Andrew West, 76, hasn't been in touch with his two sisters since 1993, following an incident when his mother gave one of her three Persian carpets to his wife. \"My mother moved in with us and gave the carpet to my wife as a thank you for taking care of her. But my two sisters were so irked by not getting what they felt should be theirs that they stopped all contact with us. Even now, I don't even know if they're alive,\" he says. \"But like so many of these things, it wasn't really about the carpet. It's about what it stood for. My sisters realised she was saying my wife was more of a daughter than they ever were.\"</p> <p>Conversely, Madeleine Starr, strategic projects manager at Carers UK, has seen cases where the whole family pulls together and actually becomes closer as a result. \"My five siblings and I are currently caring for my dad, who has dementia, and my mum, who is very frail, and we're stronger than ever.\"</p> <p>Starr, 51, believes that their rota system, which they regularly review, is largely the reason. \"Admittedly, the sibling who lives closest to our parents does most of the practical things, but we've worked it out as best we can in terms of time. One brother lives in Switzerland, but he's still part of the rota. One of the biggest resentments between siblings is about one living further away from another, but there's still a lot you can do from a distance.\"</p> <p>Looking after an elderly parent can be draining, and it can cause havoc in previously stable sibling relationships. But it's not entirely without its rewards. Laura Simms, 51, claims that doing the bulk of care for her mother is one of the best things that ever happened to her. \"All through my life, my younger sister was the articulate, capable one, and so when our mother got Alzheimer's, I thought she'd be the one holding it all together. But it quickly became clear that the roles were reversing - that this was an area I excelled in. That affected my self-esteem, while my sister felt grateful I could take over. I think my sister saw our mother as Mum and couldn't cope with what was happening, whereas I was able to see Mum as a woman in her own right. It's taught us something about each other and we're closer for it.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Some names have been changed</p>",

  "<p>Aleksandar Hemon sold his first book, a dazzling story collection called The Question of Bruno - written in his second language, English - in the closing minutes of the 1999 Champions League final. Manchester United were playing Bayern Munich. (\"Manchester United isn't my team, Liverpool is my team, but I hate Bayern Munich,\" he says.) Hemon's agent, Nicole Aragi, had organised an auction, and had been calling the 35-year-old writer with reports on its progress. \"She called me five minutes before the end of the game: 'I've got some great news.' And I said: 'I cannot talk to you right now, I'll call you back,' and hung up. And then Man United scored two goals.\" A smile drifts across Hemon's face at the memory. \"So I called her back, and said: 'Listen, what was so important that you had to call me in the middle of a fucking game?'\" Hemon bounces his cranberry juice on the table at the punchline. \"The Question of Bruno,\" Zadie Smith once remarked, \"is all right I suppose if you appreciate multilingual genius types who learn the language in six months, write with great humour and style and then get compared to Nabokov in the New York Times.\"</p> <p>A big handsome man dressed as a shy fat man - long-sleeved T-shirt into which his hands retreat, several shapeless acres of trouser - Hemon looks as though he has just completed a heavy session of computer programming; he has the awkward power and bulk of a man built by doughnuts. He is, in fact, an obsessive footballer who has been unable to play since spring, when he injured his knee. Perhaps because of this, his demeanour communicates a strange mixture of gentleness and an intense desire to kick something. </p> <p>Since his first book, Hemon has produced two further pieces of fiction in English. The second, Nowhere Man, published in 2002, picked up the story of Josef Pronek, a Hemon-like figure (a Sarajevan stranded in Chicago by the war) who first appeared in The Question of Bruno. Nowhere Man, which narrates Pronek's history from several angles, \"was something between a book of short stories and a novel\". Hemon feels there is too much categorisation in talk about writing. \"To me there's no difference between a book of stories and a novel - they're just slightly different shapes,\" he said. \"I resist when someone calls me a novelist: it implies some kind of inherent superiority of the novel. I'm not a novelist, I'm a writer.\" </p> <p>As the jacket photograph for Nowhere Man testifies, Hemon once had thick, dark, writerly hair; his scalp is now shaved brutally close. His heavy glasses spend most of the time on top of his stubble, where they make a black accent above the round edge of his skull, like a caron over the curved top of a letter O. Other faces seem suddenly skimpy by comparison. (Noses - especially Pronek's - get a hard time in Hemon: Pronek has \"a rotund nose, which seemed swollen\"; elsewhere he observes himself to have \"a tubernose\".) When Hemon slides his glasses down over his eyes, a different man, a superimposed humorist, appears: he looks like a caricature of a man wearing glasses. Nothing is fixed, identity is fluid - a point his fiction makes repeatedly and that he reluctantly concedes in discussion, politely suppressing a wince at the simplistic nature of this observation. His new book, The Lazarus Project, published to adoring reviews, continues to play with real and fictional identities (its protagonist, Vladimir Brik, is a Bosnian writer living in Chicago). Unlike its predecessors, it is unambiguously a novel, although Hemon \"didn't utter the word\" until it was finished. \"I called it 'the big book'.\"</p> <p>Hemon has two countries and two languages, caused in his case by the Yugoslavian civil war. He was born in 1964 and grew up in Sarajevo, in a flat that his family still owns in a \"five-storey socialist-ugly apartment building\". He stays there on trips back to the city (his parents now live in Canada). His parents worked at a state-owned company 10 minutes from their home: his mother as an accountant, his father as an engineer. The family - Hemon, his parents, and his younger sister Kristina - would eat lunch together every day at four, and listen to the radio news, with a special hush at 4.25 for the weather forecast. (The weather obsession has followed his parents to Canada, perhaps, Hemon thinks, because \"it's a comfortable way to imagine the future\" after the upheaval of emigration. \"They have a nice house, a garden, but somehow time is still completely out of joint.\") </p> <p>Circumstances in Sarajevo in the 1970s and 80s were not as syrupy sweet as Pronek remembers them in Nowhere Man (\"The boys were handsome, the girls beautiful, the sports teams successful, the bands good, the streets felt soft as a Persian carpet\"), but life was steady; there was, at least - Hemon uses this word a lot - \"an infrastructure\" that was penetrable to its citizens. \"Even if it's hard, sometimes, even if it's a bureaucracy, it's consistent. You go to get a personal ID, you know they're going to fuck you for two weeks, two months - but it's your choice, when to go back, you know what they're going to do, you can look for connections, you know how it works.\" </p> <p>Hemon's books are full of people who have been taken out of one context and put down in another and can't, now, see how it works - his parents standing mute in a lift as they're cheerily addressed by their American neighbours, Russian intellectuals rendered stupid by English lessons. His fiction understands the nature of such losses. Many of his stories remember life before loss, a child's world - Hemon says the move to America \"amplified\" his childhood memories. More obliquely, some of his fiction's vividness and freshness comes from his exploitation of a child's angle of view: objects loom large. Hemon remembers feeling close to the ground, \"in the literal sense, in that I would see what was on the ground; things that were on the ground attracted my attention\". Things on the ground attract his attention still, often as signifiers of losses too awful to confront directly. In The Lazarus Project, a black leather glove floats in a puddle of porridge after a pogrom. The story \"Blind Josef Pronek and the Dead Souls\", from The Question of Bruno, opens with Pronek arriving in America and realising, instantly and forlornly, that he has lost his scarf. In \"A Coin\", Sarajevans running from snipers litter the street with their belongings: \"A black leather wallet, probably empty. A purse, agape like a mouth. A white plastic water-vessel, with a bullet-hole at its centre. A green-red-brown shawl ornamented with snowflakes, dirty. A wet loaf of bread, with excited ants crawling all over it, as if building a pyramid.\" </p> <p>Hemon was a teenager when Tito died in 1980, and the writer grew interested in political journalism, and ideas such as freedom of speech, which turned out to be a more effective way to bait his parents than wearing ripped jeans. In the Hemon household, a principled stand tended to impede individual progress. \"I would fight for my right to go out in torn jeans, and they'd say absolutely not. My sister would just put on her torn jeans and leave when they weren't paying attention.\" Thanks to his own and his mother's principled refusal to pull any strings, Hemon carried out his year of military service in a grimly distant part of eastern Macedonia. (\"Some of my friends served as ski instructors in the mountains of Belgrade. I was at the border with Bulgaria.\") </p> <p>His time in the army was miserable, his instructor a \"spectacular bastard\" whom Hemon fantasised about murdering with an icicle after the man had marched them through nipple-deep snow. \"I got horribly ill and spent a week in the sanatorium with a temperature, kind of hallucinating, and I kept devising the perfect murder, how could I kill this man ... somehow I thought if I could put a piece of ice in a weapon, and shoot him in the heart, the ice would melt, leaving no trace. I had a fever, and all I ate was plum juice and plum compote, and I would run this film of a perfect ice murder in my head and then I'd pass out.\" </p> <p>Pronek's time in the army, in Nowhere Man, is equally cruddy, though he blithely lies to his parents on his return, \"presenting his army experience as one of bonding with other young men from all across Yugoslavia\". Hemon himself maintains that he cannot lie (he looks me very seriously in the eye when he says this), due to a family affliction: \"When we're upset, our vocal cords tighten and we can't speak. And when I lie - well, I can't lie, because the same thing happens - everyone who knows me knows that when I start squeaking, I've started lying.\"</p> <p>Army service was followed by a degree in English at the University of Sarajevo. Hemon read Nabokov's Lolita in translation (he still remembers the shelf on which the book sat in the library), then worked as a journalist for the Sarajevan youth press. In the winter of 1992, an organisation called the American Cultural Centre brought him to the US on a programme for young journalists. He was 28; the trip was to last a month or so, with a visit to a friend tagged on afterwards. The war began in April. He was supposed to fly back from Chicago on May 1; the siege of Sarajevo started on May 2. \"I didn't go back,\" Hemon says. </p> <p>Hemon's second life now began. Pronek lives a version of it in The Question of Bruno and Nowhere Man - working minimum-wage jobs, learning English. From June 1992 to September 1994, having acquired a social security number, Hemon wrote nothing at all, but worked as a canvasser. \"I don't know what possessed me to do that,\" he says; the job is mercilessly satirised at the end of Nowhere Man, with Pronek knocking on unfriendly doors for Greenpeace (\"Do you care about the dolphins?\"). He dictated several columns by phone to his old magazine in Sarajevo. \"But I found out after these pieces that I could not write in Bosnian. What was I going to tell them - you should go and see this movie? People under siege. I felt entirely helpless, and stupid.\"</p> <p>His much-discussed feat of teaching himself English by reading Nabokov took place around this time. As he describes it, it sounds an entirely sensible approach to the challenge, a kind of highbrow Berlitz course. \"I didn't know half the words. At the beginning I would start underlining the words I didn't know on the page, but then I started underlining too many, so I started writing them out on notecards, and whenever I read, I made lists of words and then looked them up in the dictionary.\" He read other Nabokov too. \"But Lolita ... Lolita is the bomb.\" Reading Lolita in English, after reading it in translation \"was like the difference between listening to an orchestra live and through a phone\". </p> <p>The book helped Hemon to transform himself from a man speaking what he describes as \"tourist English\" (though it is a stretch to imagine the brooding presence in front of me ever having engaged in the formulaic purchase of a double room with a bath or two return tickets), to a writer of prose that the critic James Wood recently described as being \"remarkable for its polish, lustre, and sardonic control of register\". His writing, as many have observed, is reminiscent of Nabokov's. Both fizz with similes; animating the inanimate, reimagining the commonplace. Here is a slug in Hemon: \"The dew on its back twinkled: it looked like a severed tongue.\" A defecating horse's anus opens slowly, \"like a camera aperture\". </p> <p>With his new language in place, Hemon enrolled on a graduate degree in English at Northwestern University. While he was there, chewing up Shakespeare and Marlowe, a professor remarked on the quality of one of his essays and suggested he submit his fiction to the literary magazine Triquarterly. A story in another magazine, Ploughshares, followed, which got him his American agent. He finished The Question of Bruno during his PhD, but he never finished his doctorate. Academia had been \"plan B\"; he was now able to focus on plan A, and write full-time. </p> <p>A $500,000 MacArthur \"Genius\" award in 2004 allowed him to organise his life around writing (and football) rather than survival. The Lazarus Project is a product of this time. His previous books were written \"in pieces\"; the new book was of a piece from the outset. The novel was inspired by a non-fiction account, by Walter Roth and Joe Kraus, of the case of Lazarus Averbuch, a 19-year-old Russian Jewish immigrant who was murdered by the Chicago police in 1908. One photograph in particular caught Hemon's imagination. It shows Averbuch (dark hair, dark jacket, jug ears) sitting upright in a chair. A man standing behind him supports his chin. Averbuch is already dead. </p> <p>Hemon's \"big book\" flips between two narratives: an imagining of the events around Averbuch's life and death; and a road story tracing the efforts of the writer Brik and his friend Rora, a photographer, to uncover Averbuch's world through visiting his birthplace in Kishinev (then in Russia, now in Moldova; the pair also decide to visit Ukraine, while they're at it, and fetch up in Sarajevo). Hemon made the same journey himself with his photographer friend Velibor Bozovic, who supplied some of the photographs that appear, uncaptioned, at the start of each chapter, further complicating the relationship between reporting and invention. Like all his books, The Lazarus Project has Hemon in it, but like all his books it resists any transformation into straightforward autobiography. Hemon is uninspired by what he calls \"the memoir craze\". \"I hate it beyond words. It's a crisis of the imagination,\" he says, looking wildly over my head, perhaps hoping to find a smarter reader up there. </p> <p>Despite his writhing, his tone is patient: the idea is important. \"The way I work, I start from the personal space, then expand outwards ... I'm everyone in my books. That's the whole fucking point.\"</p> <h2>Hemon on Hemon</h2> <p>\"Then there was silence. The electricity of violence and fear in the room. The down from torn pillows floating, like souls, through the fog of what had just happened. The air reeking of sweat and blood, of smashed furniture and shards of glass, of spilled food and fear ...</p> <p>A horse whinnied outside. The wind came in through the windows, but nothing inside moved.</p> <p>No one moved: Papa's face pressed against the floor in a puddle of blood; Mother lying on her side, facing the wall next to the kitchen door; Chaia curled up, her knees to her chest, the hem of her dress touching her ear; Roza on her back still; rivulets of blood spreading away from Lazarus's nose and eye sockets, across his cheeks and mouth, down to his neck.</p> <p>He is dead; they are all dead, I thought. The horrible fear rushed from my stomach to my head. They killed them all. Here it is, then.\"</p> <p>It's a furious book. In fact, it used to be more so but I've toned it down. Basically, I've been angry with America for the past eight years. It's part of a wider pattern of anger over the Bosnian war and war crimes. Some people sit and weep; I rage about the injustice of it all. </p> <p>If you write outside history, as so many novelists seem to do, then you end up writing confessional fiction, which I can't stand. That's partly why my novels play around with form. For me, history, memory and the imagination are part of the same continuum.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Extract from The Lazarus Project by Aleksandar Hemon, published by Picador</p>",
  "<p>A quarter of the government's prized academies saw their GCSE results decline this summer, despite dramatic improvements among many of the flagship schools, figures obtained by the Guardian reveal.</p> <p>Ministers announced last week that on average academies have out-performed other schools with substantial improvements in the proportion of academy pupils achieving the target of five good GCSEs including English and maths. But the headline figures masked the fact that in nine of the 36 oldest privately-sponsored academies GCSE scores went down this summer. </p> <p>Overall, the vast majority significantly improved their results compared with the schools they replaced - among the most notoriously low-performing in the country - but the fact that a significant number slipped backwards this year raises new questions about the long-term impacts of the programme and why some academies are trailing behind the others. </p> <p>Headteachers said the figures showed that academies - and all schools - need enough time to tackle historic under-performance. The government has said that all underperforming secondaries including academies should come up with a convincing improvement plan by Christmas to guarantee their future. </p> <p>The Guardian contacted the 36 academies which received at least their second set of GCSE results this year to find out the proportion of students getting five good GCSEs including English and maths; schools' results are not published centrally until October. All but five responded. Seven of the schools moved above the government's floor-target of 30% of pupils hitting the target this year, joining eight schools already achieving above average results, leaving 16 of the 31 reporting results still judged as failing to meet the minimum standards and keeping them in the category that could face closure. </p> <p>In nine schools, results declined while others saw some dramatic improvements. Some of the most mixed results came from academies sponsored by the church group United Learning Trust (ULT), which ministers have touted as a model for chains of academies. </p> <p>Kathy August, principal of ULT sponsored Manchester Academy, where the proportion of students getting five A* to C grades including English and maths increased from 21% to 35%, said the improvement had come with the first generation of pupils who had been taught all the way through the academy. She said: \"There is no quick fix. No magic bullet. It's relentless scrutiny of attendance, behaviour, maintaining quality of teaching and learning. It's basic, old-fashioned things.</p> <p>\"Academies were always intended to provide a good school to children in the most deprived postcodes. I am most proud of the fact that we've achieved that.\"</p> <p>Salford City Academy, which is co-sponsored by ULT and the Diocese of Manchester, saw the biggest drop in results going from 41% to 31% hitting the target. Charlotte Rendle-Short, deputy chief executive of ULT, said that there had been a particularly difficult GCSE group this year, with pupils whose morale had been affected by uncertainty around the school's conversion to an academy two years ago. \"This is a marathon, not a sprint. We want steady incremental improvements that we can sustain,\" she said. </p> <p>John Dunford, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \"This data shows that the government should not expect schools to turn round in a year. Schools might go up and down but you need to look over a longer timeframe.\"</p> <p>Some 51 new academies are due to open over the next two weeks. The schools secretary Ed Balls, along with several senior colleagues, is planning to visit dozens of the new schools at the beginning of next week in a sign that they are not backing away from the programme, which is now supported by all three main political parties. Schools minister Lord Adonis has signalled ambitions to expand academies beyond the 400 planned for 2011 and to allow sponsors to take over primary schools as well. Research on admissions to London schools published by the Department for Children, Schools and Families this week revealed that nearly 7% of London teenagers are now educated in academies, equalling the proportion who are taught in independent schools nationally. </p> <p>David Laws, the Liberal Democrat education spokesman, said: \"Whilst it is clear that many academies are achieving excellent results, this data shows that in some schools the performance is less impressive.\" He said ministers should limit the time sponsors were allowed to control failing academies before another stepped in. </p> <p>Adonis said the results strengthened the case for expanding the academies programme: \"The strong upward trend in academy GCSE results has continued this year - 27 of the 36 academies with results this year and last report an increase in the proportion gaining five or more higher grade GCSE passes, including in English and maths. Across all these 36 academies, the average reported result is an increase of 4.9 percentage points, which is likely to be more than twice the national increase. This is a similar academy bonus to that recorded in previous years. Every one of the academies recording a fall this year still has results higher than that of the underperforming school it replaced, over 12 percentage points higher on average.\"</p>",
  "<p>The advertising of higher education establishments has an ignoble tradition. The twisted genius who started the well-known made-up viral fact that Nottingham had a ratio of four women to every man sent a generation of males to the city to study in the hope of getting some tail. Not since the great war were more young men sent to their doom as a foray into the bars revealed thousands of horny 18-year-old boys with the same idea flanked by university vice chancellors laughing heartily as they waved their bonuses in the air, sipping champagne from a lap dancer's shoes. The University of Northampton's current TV ad shows their idiot graduates having marvellous lives as a result of the confidence they gained at the institution as the Kaiser Chiefs play in the background (stirring!). TV campaigns for former polytechnics never deviate from the winning template of utterly interchangeable buzzwords like: challenge, choice, aspiration and achievement that could apply to any university (well, any university that doesn't have to resort to TV adverts to fill its halls). We must never repeat the Nottingham atrocity. Some honesty is required.</p>",
  "<p>It happened in February 1970, in Harrogate where I grew up. I was 17, working as a kennel maid while waiting to hear if I'd been granted interviews at any of the drama schools I'd applied to. I was also about to go back to London to record a demo for a record producer who believed I could be \"the next Mary Hopkin\". Everyone thought I was beautiful, and had my life continued along that path, I would have probably become unbearably vain and full of myself. </p> <p>Then, six weeks before my 18th birthday, my motorbike collided with a drink-driver who pulled out of a side road in front of me. Conveniently, it happened right outside the A&amp;E department of the local hospital. My face took the full force, sliced through from the bridge of my nose down to my jawline and left hanging in a flap. The nurses, who heard the crash and were first on the scene, initially thought they'd have to search for the remains in the road.</p> <p>The day I was due to be transferred from my single room in the hospital to a ward, I asked for a mirror; the other patients were obviously going to stare at me and I wanted to know what they'd be looking at. The nurses were reluctant but I insisted. With my swollen face criss-crossed with black stitches I thought I resembled Herman from The Munsters, but instead of revulsion I had a strangely comforting feeling of \"Aha, so this is what I've been waiting for.\" Perhaps that's why I managed to keep my sense of humour, and why I was more distressed about my hair being greasy than about my grotesque reflection. Or perhaps it was the drugs. </p> <p>After a few weeks I had an appointment with a plastic surgeon. I assumed he would tell me he'd be able to whip me in and have me looking good as new in no time. So when he said he couldn't do anything for a year, and then it would take a succession of operations at six-monthly intervals, I was devastated. When you're 18, a year seems like eternity. </p> <p>Those first 12 months were gruelling, for my parents and sister more than for me. Mum and Dad knew how ambitious I'd been and how bright my future had seemed. They wondered if I'd cope in the long term. I knew I would. But I didn't have the insight to acknowledge how angry I was, and took my frustration out on them. </p> <p>For most of that time I rarely left the house at night except to walk my dog. I went to the cinema a few times but always fled before the film finished and the lights came on: missing the ending was unimportant compared with avoiding the shock on people's faces. On the few occasions I did venture out in daylight, I became furious if anyone looked at me. It was only when I hurled a cast-iron saucepan at my sister one day and realised I could have killed her that I understood I had to learn to control my temper. I had to come to terms with the fact that my life wasn't going to be what I'd expected.</p> <p>The surgeon worked wonders, and after each operation my scars became slightly less evident. Eventually I overcame my horror of being pitied and started living a normal life again, defiantly behaving as though there was nothing different about me. But, to my surprise, I discovered that because I didn't try to cower away from inquisitive stares, nobody felt sorry for me. Just the opposite. People were intrigued; they saw me as a heroic figure, and I had more boyfriends than ever before. I was always being told how brave I was, and how amazing it was that it hadn't affected my personality. But it wasn't bravery. It was what would now be described as being \"in denial\"; a stubborn refusal on my part to accept that I was ugly. And it gradually dawned on me that the less I cared about my scars, the less people noticed them.</p> <p>Someone once suggested that, with modern surgery techniques, I could have my looks improved. But why put myself through that when I'm happy with my face? The most attractive people don't have perfect features. So, although being \"in denial\" is viewed as a negative attitude, it worked for me. It prevented me from turning into a sad, unattractive recluse and enabled me to become a self-confident, optimistic wife and mother of three. I firmly believe that if I'd been \"realistic\" and accepted that my life was permanently blighted, then it would have remained so. Which is why I will always describe my experience as an example of mind over matter, rather than a catastrophe that ruined my life.</p>",
  "<p>Leading academics, authors and scientists are launching a campaign to stop state-funded faith schools from discriminating against students and teachers on the grounds of religion. </p> <p>From Monday, such schools will be allowed to include faith as a selection criterion for teaching and non-teaching posts, reserving more places for people from the same religious background.</p> <p>In some schools this will expand to include the headteacher while in others this would apply to non-teaching jobs, such as classroom assistants and cooks.</p> <p>The new rules coincide with the launch of Accord, a coalition of Hindu, Christian and Humanist organisations, which claims that they will further restrict the employment rights of staff in state-funded faith schools and that discrimination of this kind is illegal in other state schools.</p> <p>Accord's supporters also include the scientist professor Colin Blakemore, the former education secretary Tessa Blackstone, novelist Philip Pullman and the philosopher AC Grayling.</p> <p>Prominent Jewish figures are angry that two rabbis from progressive movements, David Goldberg, emeritus rabbi of the Liberal Jewish Synagogue in St John's Wood, and rabbi Jonathan Romain, of Maidenhead Synagogue, are involved with Accord, with Goldberg saying that faith schools caused people \"to live parallel lives\".</p> <p>\"I am very happy for every religion to maintain its identity while still fully participating in the civic life of the country; but I am not persuaded that faith schools are the best way to heal our fractured society.\"</p> <p>Philanthropist Benjamin Perl, who has founded and provided funding for at least 20 of the 39 Jewish state schools in England and Wales said their involvement was disgraceful.</p> <p>In 2006 faith schools were handed new powers to discriminate when Lord Adonis, the schools minister, brought forward an amendment to the education bill allowing them to favour members of the same religion when choosing support staff. Shortly afterwards the education secretary, Alan Johnson, said he would no longer try to force faith schools to accept up to a quarter of their pupils from other faiths or with no religion. The climbdown infuriated those who claim single faith schools fuel ethnic, religious and social segregation.</p> <p>Earlier this year the National Union of Teachers unveiled plans to rival faith schools, proposing that all schools should become practising multi-faith institutions. Headteachers would bring in imams, rabbis and priests to instruct religious pupils as part of the curriculum in an attempt to satisfy parental demand for religion in schools.</p>",
  "<p>The pharmaceutical industry is under siege with the looming end of blockbuster drugs, imminent patent expiries on top-selling medicines and government pressure to lower prices amid accusations of profiteering.</p> <p>GlaxoSmithKline's new boss, Andrew Witty, has likened discovering a blockbuster - with annual revenues of at least $1bn - to finding a needle in a haystack. Many of the big-selling medicines launched in the 1990s are about to come off patent, allowing generic drugmakers to make cheaper versions. Only four of the 10 major companies have enough products in their pipeline to plug the looming revenue shortfall.</p> <p>\"We've seen the end of the very big blockbuster, the likes of Lipitor,\" said Kate Moss at PricewaterhouseCoopers. \"There's not enough time for a product to become a massive blockbuster. There's so much competition in the market.\"</p> <p>The world's top-selling drug, Lipitor, will lose its patent in 2011, threatening Pfizer's $12.7bn (\u00a37bn) annual sales from the anti-cholesterol drug.</p> <p>Professor Sir Michael Rawlins, who chairs health watchdog Nice, infuriated the industry last week when he accused it of overpricing vital new medicines. But drugs companies reject the charge, pointing to initiatives on pricing. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) says UK drug prices have fallen by 21% in real terms over the past decade. </p> <p>\"It takes \u00a3550m - and 10-12 years - to bring a new drug to the patient,\" said a spokeswoman. \"It's an investment in public health. It's only natural that the companies need to make a return on this initial investment.\" </p> <p>Nice refused to approve expensive new kidney drugs for NHS use, saying they are not cost effective - despite an offer from Pfizer to pay for the first round of treatments. </p> <p>The move highlights efforts by Big Pharma to be more flexible on pricing. Under an innovative funding scheme, Johnson &amp; Johnson allowed the NHS to recoup the cost of its Velcade medicine for bone marrow cancer if patients show no or minimal improvement. At GSK, Europe's biggest drugmaker, Witty has proposed a \"pricing for value\" model. Under the formula, companies would be paid little for new drugs at the outset but would be reimbursed fully once their value is proven. </p> <p>Richard Barker, ABPI director general, said: \"Nice needs to combine pure economic arithmetic with other considerations: the severity of the condition, the availability of alternative treatments, the consequences of refusing treatment in terms of the length and quality of life, and the savings in the use of carers.\"</p> <p><strong>Nice and early</strong></p> <p>In another important move, the industry and Nice would get together at an earlier stage to discuss which drugs the government is likely to fund when they come to market. Under a recent pilot project, Swiss group Novartis discussed new drugs with Nice before clinical trials were designed. GSK now talks to the health watchdog from phase II of drug trials - the intermediate stage of development - rather than afterwards.</p> <p>\"The idea of early dialogue is now accepted on both sides,\" said Barker.</p> <p>Moss pointed out that regulators at Nice will need to have the right skills to analyse early clinical data. Drugmakers, for their part, should carry out tests to determine which patients benefit from a drug so that their use can be targeted.</p> <p>The cost of R&amp;D has risen as companies chase fewer new molecules. Alan Sheppard at consultancy IMS Health reckons the chances of discovering a blockbuster have halved from 10-1 to 20-1. He cited competition, pricing, safety concerns and fewer unmet clinical needs. \"The increased rigour in being able to get a product to market means that far more molecules have to be screened before a likely candidate can be positively identified,\" he said. </p> <p>In response, companies are targeting niche drugs for cancers and neurological diseases - expensive treatments for relatively small numbers of patients.</p> <p>\"We can expect drug research in large, well-served areas like pain relief to be reduced,\" said Marc Gerstein, a former consultant to US firms Eli Lilly and Pfizer. \"New drugs for niche conditions are likely to be fantastically expensive. In many cases, it will seem like blackmail. Without government assistance or insurance, treatment will simply not be affordable for many.\" </p> <p>The outcome of the US election could have a significant impact. Senator Barack Obama wants Medicare to negotiate directly with companies to drive down drug prices that are on average twice as high as those in Britain.</p> <p>The industry has also been hit by large-scale public health scares. In his recent book Flirting with Disaster: Why Accidents Are Rarely Accidental, Gerstein analyses US drugmaker Merck's Vioxx disaster - the painkiller had to be withdrawn in 2004 after causing thousands of heart attacks and strokes.</p> <p>\"Could this happen in the UK?\" he asked. \"The odds seem lower than in the US, but the pressures to enhance drug marketing and co-opt the regulators are ever present. There is a lot of money at stake.\"</p> <p>In Britain, GSK had to issue new safety warnings after its diabetes drug Avandia was linked with an increased risk of heart attacks last year.</p> <p>As blockbusters become rarer, drugmakers such as GSK have switched their focus to developing a range of \"middle earners\" with annual revenues of \u00a3200-300m. Witty declared in July: \"GSK must change if it is to be successful in the future.\" There is a new focus on vaccines - which are hard to copy - and household brands like Ribena, Horlicks and Lucozade. </p> <p><strong>Biologics and generics</strong></p> <p>Companies are also investing heavily in developing biological medicines, which can often be used to treat several conditions and are harder to replicate than conventional chemical drugs. Roche offered more than $40bn to take full control of US biotech partner Genentech in July. AstraZeneca, the UK's second-largest drugmaker, has acquired biotech firms Cambridge Antibody Technology and MedImmune, and aims to derive 25% of its new drugs from biologics by 2010. </p> <p>GSK set up a new biopharmaceuticals R&amp;D division in June, headed by Ian Tomlinson, the former boss of the acquired antibodies firm Domantis. He described it as \"a big move for GSK\". He wants to take biological products from 6% to 20% of GSK's pipeline by 2015.</p> <p>Companies are organising R&amp;D into smaller groups of scientists, to operate more like speciality pharmaceuticals groups such as Shire, Britain's third-biggest drugmaker.</p> <p>To boost revenues, Big Pharma is also venturing into the generics market. Global generic medicines are now worth $71.7bn, a tenth of the entire world drug market valued at $712bn. </p> <p>As companies focus more on producing costly treatments for rare diseases or benefiting certain patient groups, the NHS will face new spending dilemmas. IMS Health's Sheppard wondered: \"Are we still underfunding our health service? We get good value for money but if we put more money in, would people's health improve?\"</p> <h2>At a glance</h2> <p><strong>Medicines coming off patent</strong></p> <p><strong>2011</strong> Lipitor anti-cholesterol (Pfizer) Annual sales: $12.7bn</p> <p><strong>2011</strong> Seroquel for schizophrenia (AstraZeneca) $4bn</p> <p><strong>2010</strong> Advair for asthma (GSK) $6.4bn</p> <p><strong>2010</strong> Arimidex for breast cancer (AstraZeneca) $1.7bn</p> <p>(Patents typically expire 10-15 years after marketing approval is granted)</p>",
  "<p>You've arrived back in Blighty, tanned and rested after a fortnight soaking up the sun in foreign climes. You lug the suitcases up the garden path, make a mental note to trim the hedge, and then you open the front door.</p> <p>Your heart goes into your stomach as you survey the grim scene in front of you: the contents of drawers scattered all over the floor, cupboards flung open, gaps in the corner where the TV and music system used to be.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this is a time of year when many people will return from their summer holiday to discover their home has been ransacked by burglars.</p> <p>For many, this will be the event that spurs them into getting an alarm installed. But choosing the alarm that is right for your home and your budget is no easy task - there are stacks of different systems available and you are entering a world filled with jargon.</p> <p><strong>But I thought fewer houses were being burgled nowadays.</strong><br>The most recent British Crime Survey data published last month showed that the number of domestic burglaries in England and Wales has fallen dramatically in recent years - from 1.7m in 1996 to 729,000 in 2007/08. But that downward trend is likely to be reversed if the UK economy sinks into a recession, with government officials predicting that the economic slowdown will lead to \"upward pressure\" on levels of property crime.</p> <p><strong>So how much will a burglar alarm set me back?</strong> <br>How long is a piece of string? You can pick up a cheap DIY alarm from Argos for \u00a339.99. The Micromark Easy Fit Burglar Alarm Kit includes an external box, control panel, two movement detectors and two magnetic door contacts.</p> <p>At the other end of the spectrum, an all-singing, all-dancing monitored system installed by professionals - perhaps including a control panel linked to the police, several infrared movement sensors and shock detectors, remote control gizmo and alarm boxes - may well set you back \u00a31,000 or more. And there are lots of options in between. As with all these things, it depends on how much you want to spend.</p> <p>This month's Which? magazine carries a report on burglar alarms. Its researchers called 281 companies to get a price for installing and maintaining a wired alarm system for a three-bedroom semi. The average figure quoted for installation was \u00a3475, plus around \u00a3150 a year for a combined maintenance and monitoring contract. However, in London and the south-east, the average installation cost was higher - around \u00a3590.</p> <p><strong>What are the different types of alarm?</strong> <br>Broadly, it boils down to a choice between \"bells-only\", a monitored alarm and/or a speech dialler.</p> <p>\u2022 A bells-only alarm, aka an audible-only alarm, simply makes a racket when it is triggered. A bells-only alarm may deter intruders and alert your neighbours when it goes off, but on its own won't generate a police response, says Eagle Security Solutions, based in Greenwich, south-east London. Which? says you should expect to pay \u00a3390-\u00a3600 for one of these.</p> <p>\u2022 With a monitored alarm, you pay extra to have your system connected via telephone line or radio network to a \"receiving centre\", which typically monitors signals received from your alarm 24 hours a day. What might happen is that a detector is triggered and a signal is sent to the receiving centre. Someone at the centre then immediately phones your home for password identification and to check everything is OK. If the password ID is not given, or the phone is not picked up, one of the keyholders you have nominated and/or the police are notified.</p> <p>A monitored alarm will incur monthly or annual service charges on top of the installation costs.</p> <p>\u2022 A speech dialler is a cheaper alternative to a monitored system. This is a device that can be connected to an alarm, or may already be built into the control panel. If there is a break-in, the speech dialler automatically calls the phone numbers that have been programmed in and leaves a pre-recorded message. Which? says having a speech dialler installed as an extra typically costs \u00a3100 to \u00a3150.</p> <p><strong>I like the idea of the police being notified. Tell me more.</strong> <br>Many companies will allow you to have your system linked to the police. Security firms say this is a good idea because many police forces won't respond to a bell-only alarm, unless there is also first-hand evidence of a crime being committed.</p> <p>But you will have to pay for this peace of mind. For example, Eagle Security Solutions charges from \u00a39.99 a month for alarm monitoring where only the keyholders are nominated, with this rising to \u00a320-plus a month if you want to be hooked up to the law. Often the amount you pay for police response will include maintenance of your alarm system, which tends to be mandatory. Also, the security firm that you use will have to apply for a unique reference number on your behalf from your local police; this will typically cost up to \u00a345. In addition, the alarm will have to be installed by a company that meets certain requirements.</p> <p>Because of the problem of false alarms, the police will usually only go out to your home if two detection devices (such as sensors) are activated in sequence. If only one is triggered, just the keyholder will be contacted. Even if two or more detectors are activated, do not assume officers will drop everything and rush to the scene immediately.</p> <p>If you keep having false alarms, you will find yourself struck off the police register. In London, for example, notch up three false alarms within 12 months and you will be demoted to \"level three police response\". The bad news is that this equals no response; it means your system is \"banned\".</p> <p><strong>Which firm should I use?</strong><br> The big names include ADT, Chubb and Dyno-Secure (part of British Gas). However, many people buy their alarm from an independent company. Talk to friends and neighbours about who provides their alarm. Are they happy with it? Does it go off when it shouldn't? How much do they pay for monitoring and maintenance? Go for a company that is approved by an independent body such as the National Security Inspectorate (NSI).</p> <p><strong>It all sounds like a lot of money and hassle.</strong> <br>You might want to consider buying an empty burglar alarm box. The <a href=\"http://www.Screwfix.com\">Screwfix.com</a> website sells dummy alarm boxes that cost just \u00a37.29 a pop. It's probably going to be better than nothing - and at least it won't annoy the neighbours by going off for no reason while you are out.</p> <h2>Will it ring an insurer's bell?</h2> <p>Most insurance companies offer a discount of between 2% and 15% on the cost of home contents insurance if you have a burglar alarm, according to this month's Which? magazine.</p> <p>But research from comparison website <a href=\"http://www.Tescocompare.com\">Tescocompare.com</a> has produced a very different picture, concluding that installing an alarm \"does not seem to translate into lower insurance premiums\".</p> <p>Tescocompare found that the average saving on your annual home insurance premium from adding an alarm to your property is only \u00a35 - not much compared to the cost of installing and maintaining a security system. \"If you are planning on adding extra security like this, solely because you want to lower your premium, you may find it does very little to bring down costs,\" says a spokesman.</p> <p>He adds that in the case of several companies, including Bradford &amp; Bingley, Budget and the AA, the premiums were exactly the same, whether or not you had an alarm. Prudential, Swinton and Kwik Fit were among the firms prepared to offer a small discount.</p> <p>The Association of British Insurers says: \"If you are considering installing an alarm, get advice from your insurer before buying one.\" But it adds: \"Most alarms only warn that someone has already broken in. Your first priority is to stop them getting in at all.\"</p>",
  "<p>These are turbulent times for the late-night talk show. In 2009, Jay Leno will be forced to accept voluntary redundancy and step down from his 16-year perch atop NBC's <strong>Tonight Show</strong>. Leno's successor is Conan O'Brien, whose 12.30am slot will be taken over by former SNL ensemble player Jimmy Fallon. The decision to get shot of Leno before the audience tires of him has made the late-night king an even hotter property. ABC is so determined to acquire his talents, it's willing to axe news show <strong>Nightline </strong>and push loyal servant Jimmy Kimmel back to the wee hours if that's what it takes. Fox, which has never managed to introduce a successful late-night presence, is also desperate to nab him. </p> <p>But there's someone none of the broadcast networks have any interest in signing up. A woman. Any woman. Ever. If we take Steve Allen's 1953 Tonight Show as the blueprint for the modern day talk show, that makes ... um ... almost 127 years of a format that has seen exactly one female host. Since Joan Rivers' ill-fated 1986 talk show on Fox, the late-night desk has remained under male stewardship. What's the thinking? Is it that Rosie O'Donnell and Ellen Degeneres project a gal-pal affability that charms daytime audiences but lacks the authority to hold a late-night crowd? Is it that female comics who might be considered for such a high-profile gig wilt before the unforgiving scrutiny that comes with it? </p> <p>Whatever the reasons, they're bogus because America's best late-night talk show host is a woman. What makes the porno-named Chelsea Handler's achievement most notable is that just months ago, she was America's worst late-night talk-show host. Anyone squirming through the first episode of the E! Channel's <strong>Chelsea Lately</strong> will tell you the same. Handler, a Botoxed famewhore of a certain age came across way too anxious to be your bitchy best friend. Her show's opening segment - media leeches dissecting the day's celeb train wrecks - was an orgy of fumbled punchlines. Her Z-list Q&amp;As were painful exercises in I'm-funnier-than-you. And her sidekick was a Mexican dwarf.</p> <p>Hard as it may be to believe a TV show could improve from such calamity, I'm here to tell you that Chelsea Handler has become a compelling trash-talker. Now Handler rules that round table with a rod of iron, crushing guests with an eye-roll if they don't measure up (June Sarpong was a recent victim). The wee Mexican? Still there, but now he has a purpose. When she asks his opinion on some Brangelina upheaval, he yawns, \"Who cares? It's boring\", an unheard-of critique on the E! Channel's raison'detre. Interviewees are still culled from the bottom of the post-reality barrel but she rises above by staging events like an interview with a fake trio of Jonas Brothers that culminated in Handler attempting to breastfeed one J-sibling while sucking off his purity ring. E! is the perfect berth for Chelsea Handler but her presence there may help convince the network dunderheads that someday, America might like to go to bed with a woman. </p> <p>Elsewhere, E! is awash in anything-for-attention Lohans, Kardashians and Denise Richardses, but there's a big blonde whale who's long swum out of range of the network's harpoons. Finally, though, E! has hooked Pamela Anderson. But at what cost? Pam's turned down innumerable reality shows and only acquiesced when E! promised her total creative control. Which is to say that <strong>Pam: Girl On The Loose</strong> is mostly shaky-cam footage, much of it taken up with introductions to Pam's mother, brother and the characters who make up her entourage. When we're not spending time with people who aren't Pam, she's constantly reminding us, \"I'm hysterical!\" without actually ever doing anything to back up her assertion. Pamela Anderson has persuaded a gossip-obsessed media outlet to pony up what looks like a sizeable budget and spent it on a show that is Not Trashy Enough! I can't recommend anyone watch a second of P:GOTL, but as an exercise in giving an audience exactly what it doesn't want, I can only applaud. </p> <p>You're a strapping blonde with a tight, supportive family. Suddenly, your brother is jailed for manslaughter. Your parents split up. And you find out your dad had an affair with one of your friends. What do you do? If you're Brooke, daughter of Hulk Hogan, you disregard that every iota of misfortune landed in the aftermath of your previous reality show, Hogan Knows Best and you sign up for the sequel. </p> <p>Ostensibly, VH-1's <strong>Brooke Knows</strong> <strong>Best</strong> is an organic outgrowing of the previous series: all grown up, Brooke moves into a Miami penthouse away from the prying eyes of her psychotically over-protective dad. Of course, the Hulkster still lumbers through painful scripted scenes where he interrogates her gay room-mate and tries to stop her throwing hottub parties. But, at the same time, the series, specifically designed to showcase a hot blonde frolicking on the beach, has to acknowledge Brooke's life is falling apart. </p> <p>In between the Miami nightlife, Brooke reflects sadly on what's become of the rollicking family who breezed through life for four seasons of Hogan Knows Best. When she's scoping out buff dudes on the beach, we find ourselves sighing, \"Poor Brooke, trying to blot out the pain.\" When she's joshing with Hulk, we're thinking, \"Once the trust is gone, can it ever really be re-established?\" And when Brooke announces her intention to carry on with her pop career - the reason the first series existed - we're thinking, \"Haven't we all suffered enough?\".</p>",
  "<p>I had my first photograph published in 1976, a one-inch photo of Sham 69. It had my name down the side, and that got me jumping in the air. I went to a lot of gigs, took what I could and tried to get it to a magazine. </p> <p>Usually I got the best photo towards the end of the gig. You have to put up with the jostling and sweat, people jumping. Often you're watching gigs, not taking enough notice of the music, but there have been moments when I've experienced something unique. When Stevie Wonder brought on Marvin Gaye and Diana Ross? I got very emotional. I saw Jeff Buckley and he got inside my soul. It raises your spirit.</p> <p>It can be soul-destroying to be on the road with a band. It's a bubble, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but I can see why it makes people happy. I've been up in front of the crowds to give introductions. I've yelled, 'Are you ready, Melbourne?' to thousands. It's great to hear them screaming for you, but I like being on the side. The darkroom used to make me very happy. It's like meditation in there, patiently waiting to see which images emerge.</p> <p>'Happiness is a warm gun.' What is it, really? Who knows? Contentment with what you're doing, the friends you have. I'm aware of my happiness; I've felt the sadness of a divorce. Money or women - they seem to be the greatest sources of unhappiness. </p> <p>I'm lucky with my pictures, I always have been, and that's what makes me happiest.

  "<p><strong>My fingernails look in good condition, with no white flecks, ridges, peeling or flaking, but they bend and are very soft.

Any suggestions?</strong></p> <p>There is no deficiency I know that produces soft fingernails that are otherwise normal, and in which the person is in normal health. I wonder, however, why you are taking so many supplements? Long-term use of supplements, instead of a varied diet, has been shown to produce harm. If you are worried about your nails, tell your doctor about your diet and your supplements, and he/she may well do some blood tests to see if you are missing some vital element in your restricted diet. </p> <p><strong>Is it true you can have an operation to make your voice sound younger again?

The surgery makes them feel they are speaking with a 'younger' voice.

That's why so many adults had all their teeth removed in the first half of the 20th century - to protect against infections. With much better dental hygiene and more effective treatments, that risk is reduced. Flossing and visiting a hygienist regularly are still worthwhile, for their own sake: whether they'll protect against heart attacks is debatable - the present consensus is that most don't stem from infection. So do get gum disease treated, but protect against heart attack by exercising regularly, not smoking, keeping high blood pressure under control and minimising blood cholesterol.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Do you have a question for Dr Smith?

  "<p>Nobody ever said on their deathbed that they wished they'd spent more time at the office. It's an old gag turning into a new reality: full-time, white-collar workers are spending even less time in the office - and when we're in the office, even less time shackled to the same few square metres of an assigned workstation by our fixed telephone extension and dedicated computer, whose cables snake into an underfloor spaghetti junction that roots us to that spot and that spot only.</p> <p>With the wireless-networked Generation Y \"millennials\" setting the pace, we are all now mobile; it's just that some offices haven't yet realised it. But the smart office is here, and, according to the giants of office design and equipment, those who hold out against ever-smarter thinking in the white-collar workplace will not only be technologically, environmentally and socially out of date, but severely out of pocket.</p> <p>An independent survey (undertaken on behalf of the international architecture and interior design firm Gensler) of UK knowledge-based office workers across a range of activities, from banking to marketing, has identified a huge efficiency gap in the average British office. Companies in the UK, on average, productively use just 55% of their office space; in London's key business districts alone, that's \u00a310.5bn wasted each year. Two thirds of UK employees are \"unhappy\" with their current workspace, and staff productivity could be improved by 21% if their workplaces were better designed, equivalent to \u00a3145bn of annual output for the UK's service sector.</p> <p>Following the post-war proliferation of cheap and cheerless office buildings, our white-collar workplaces are perhaps the least-loved in Europe. But thanks to the surge of prestigious new office building developments to mark London as the world's financial capital, all this is changing for the better, according to Gary Wheeler, Gensler's European director of workspace. </p> <p>\"Socialisation at work has become much more important,\" he says. \"The water-cooler used to be looked at negatively. Not any more. It's where you go to find people you trust to exchange knowledge. Cafes are the knowledge marketplace. Head-down work amounts to about half your time in the office, and it is shrinking compared to collaboration, which is growing, especially as more women enter the workplace who want sharing, validation and feedback.\"</p> <p>Nor is Gensler alone in seizing the moment to shape the space where we spend so many of our waking hours.</p> <p>Strasbourg is the site of Gutenberg's original printing press and is a hotbed of revolutionary office technology - namely WorkLab, the European research facility and showcase of the world's largest office furniture manufacturer and workspace designer, Steelcase.</p> <p>It calls the site a campus, and with reason. This playful, airy and friendly site sets a mood of convivial exploration and experiment rather than clock-punching graft. No one has an assigned workstation, yet meeting spaces of all shapes, sizes and degrees of informality abound; their \"yurts\" and \"dyadic slices\" look like they should be occupied by waifs modelling vintage Cardin and Courr\u00e8ges. The buzz-concepts governing Steelcase's macro- and micro-designs on our working environment are collaborative work, mobile work, broad social networks and four-generation workforce: welcome, in short, to Wikiworld. Yet the Steelcase client list, from \"big oil\" and \"big software\" down, demonstrates this is no mutated survival from the 90s dotcom bubble but the prototype of how millions will work tomorrow.</p> <p>And that isn't all. Environmental soundness lies at the heart of Steelcase's work. The US multinational scrutinises its products and suppliers down to the molecular level for environmental sustainability. With sales rising as corporate customers strive for a greener image, Steelcase's entwined environmental and telecommunications strategies are also cutting energy, travel and floorspace costs. The result is higher profits.</p> <p>London-based PR giant Edelman has rushed to embrace the revolution in office design. Gensler's brief was to design an HQ that would both help integrate three separate workforces under one roof and quickly adapt to the firm's fluctuating workload and headcount through hotdesking. It had to be \"exciting and engaging\" for staff, explains deputy CEO Susan Eastoe. \"It has to create the right impression for clients: classy, elegant and trustworthy.\" </p> <p>Inside, a bistro, bar, library, glass walls and skylights, couches and soft furnishings foster \"transparency, socialising and collaboration. Everybody went 'Wow!' when they walked in, which really lifted morale. People walk around, talk, bounce ideas and work creatively for the client.\"</p> <p>The revolution is reaching even into unglamorous public sector poor relations such as the Driver and Vehicle-Licensing Agency, which has redesigned its Swansea HQ as part of a strategy to raise staff morale, increase efficiency and save money through rationalising space. Sociable \"break-out spaces\" throughout and \"non-territorial working\" is its version of the hotdesking concept. The DVLA has four desks per five staff members, and the system is flexible enough to move with the business. </p> <p>How has it all gone down with the staff? \"At the outset there was a lot of concern,\" admits Jeremy Morgan, who runs the DVLA refurbishment process. \"But we could make a good financial and environmental case, and as people got used to the new way of working, enthusiasm has snowballed.\"</p> <p>And with Steelcase's UK and Benelux managing director, Mark Spragg, forecasting that despite the current downturn in the economy, the UK private and public sector combined will spend over \u00a335bn on the development and the refurbishment of their office spaces in the next year, chances are the snowball is heading your way. </p> <h2>How our workspaces will change</h2> <p><strong>Collaborative spaces</strong><br>From the casual sofa by the water-cooler to the wireless, multi-screen \"war room\" with video and web conferencing, instant messaging and interactive whiteboards and easy-wipe walls for spontaneous, paperless brainstorming. Flexible mind-meeting places will move from the periphery to the heart of office design.</p> <p><strong>Mobile workstations</strong><br>Updating unreserved hotdesking, with \"hotelling\" you reserve the space and facilities you need, with your firm's IT and phone system clicking automatically into place and your personal items following you round in a lockable file pedestal on wheels. Next-generation office furniture is easily interlockable to create working spaces for open teamwork or privacy, with chairs that adjust and flex to fit your movements and promote alertness or relaxation at will.</p> <p><strong>Social networking</strong><br>With studies showing different age-groups in the multi-generational workforce less inclined to collaborate across age gaps, office design will seek to break down barriers through attractive open-planning.</p> <p><strong>BlueSpace</strong><br>A Steelcase-IBM joint development venture combining office furniture and microprocessors that can automatically tailor the space, shape, function, privacy, ambient sound and light of your personal and group working environment. For instance, concealed ceiling sub-woofers emit frequencies that mask distracting background chat, while lighting can mimic the sun's arc, so keeping your body clock ticking in natural sync.</p>",
  "<p>So much for the big, happy family that is European golf. With 48 hours left until Nick Faldo announces his Ryder Cup squad to play the United States next month the pressure finally told on two potential team members yesterday as they forsook the pressing business of catching the captain's eye on the golf course to indulge themselves in a catfight off it.</p> <p>\"Oh well, it is nice to be told what to do by one so young and so inexperienced,\" said an apoplectic Colin Montgomerie last night at Gleneagles, where he is competing in the Johnnie Walker Championship. He was responding to comments by Ian Poulter in Boston, where he is competing in a PGA tour event, to the effect that Monty should mind his own business after the Scotsman claimed the Englishman had a \"hotline\" to Faldo.</p> <p>\"I don't need to talk about Monty,\" said Poulter, then immediately ignored his own advice. \"He should just keep his head down and try to play good golf.\"</p> <p>\"Can you believe he said that?\" came Monty's response. \"The only reason we said he had a hotline to Nick Faldo is that he is the only one saying he had spoken to Nick. Has anyone else said it? No. Right then.\"</p> <p>With that the Scot flounced off to the car park, leaving observers to wonder what the next instalment of this trans-atlantic slanging match would bring. What it probably will not bring, at least for Montgomerie and Poulter, is a call from captain Faldo telling them they are both in the team. In the current circumstances it is hard to believe they could play in the same continent, far less the same uniform, without getting into an argument. It will be either one or the other come tomorrow evening. Or possibly neither.</p> <p>If that sounds inconclusive then it is entirely in keeping with a Ryder Cup selection process that grows ever foggier - and, it has to be said, ever more gripping - as tomorrow's denouement approaches.</p> <p>As many as six players were in contention for the final three spots in the European team before the start of the Johnnie Walker Championship and as yesterday's second round headed towards its conclusion all six were still in contention. \"I know this sounds silly to say, but it feels a bit like you are playing for your life,\" said Soren Hansen, who started the week ninth in the Ryder Cup points list.</p> <p>The Dane needed a good performance to cement his place on the team and was halfway there after shooting a two-under-par 71 to finish on four under overall for the round. That left him tied for seventh, three shots behind the 36-hole leader, Gr\u00e9gory Havret. Justin Rose was another who looked set to confirm his place on the team, ending the day on two under par.</p> <p>That leaves one spot for either Oliver Wilson, Nick Dougherty or Ross Fisher, with Wilson the strong favourite. The Englishman started yesterday's round poorly but played the back nine in three under par to make the cut - a valiant effort in the circumstances and one that means Dougherty or Fisher would need to finish in the top three to deny him his first Ryder Cup appearance. The contest between the three twentysomethings will be one of the more intriguing subplots of an intriguing weekend but, inevitably, it will be overshadowed by the continued speculation about the identity of Faldo's two picks.</p> <p>When the week began, the smart money was on two from Poulter, Paul Casey and Darren Clarke. The Irishman, who won last week's KLM Open in Holland, is the only one playing here this week and finished yesterday with a 36-hole total of 145, one under par. That is a good performance by any standard, but not least because Clarke is no fan of the Gleneagles course.</p> <p>\"I have hit the ball really well but the greens got me. But I have got to keep doing what I have been doing and maybe hit some of the right heel marks out there instead of the wrong ones,\" he said.</p> <p>Clarke has made a brilliant effort to extend his string of Ryder Cup appearances to six but for reasons not entirely clear his odds of making Faldo's team are judged to be slim and getting slimmer. It is not fair, he might think, but then as everyone who has played the game for a living knows, golf is never fair.</p>",
  "<h2>Hellboy: The Science Of Evil<br>Xbox 360 (reviewed), PS3, PSP</h2> <p>Arriving in tandem with Guillermo del Toro's visceral Hollywood sequel, Hellboy, with his red eyes, horn stumps and long tail, does appear to cut an unlikely figure as a hero, which is at least part of what might be called his charm. In the game at least. The other part is Ron Perlman's splendid vocal skill, which stands out as a single chink of light in an otherwise depressingly standard pound 'em-up that follows every other half-arsed movie tie-in straight round the U-bend. In this paint by numbers setup you control Hellboy, bereft of co-stars and supporting characters, smashing his way to victory by hammering the punch and kick buttons. Overcome all obstacles by repeatedly tapping X to get the big orange fella to smash, lift or prise apart whatever irrelevancy happens to be in your way before continuing to the next lifeless fist fight.

  "<p>The face that launched a thousand quips about cosmetic surgery celebrates her 75th birthday with her West End acting debut. Joan Rivers may be best known for her machine-gun-paced stand-up but she previously appeared on Broadway in the Neil Simon play Lost In Yonkers and made her stage debut off-Broadway as Barbra Streisand's lover. In truth, this is only just a play: there are four characters but it is more an autobiographical confessional as she sits in her dressing room before her annual verbal TV assault on the Oscars catwalk. One thing is for sure: Rivers, a pioneer comedian in a man's world back in the 1960s, never pulls any punches and here she muses on ageing, the death of her husband and manager, and being a woman in Hollywood.

  "<p>There he goes again. John McCain went out and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.johnmccain1\">found himself a vice-presidential candidate</a> today, but as is often his way, he made sure that political gain was his master, while potential to lead this nation during troubled times was placed on the back burner.</p> <p>And he accuses Barack Obama of \"not putting his country first\"? </p> <p>McCain's choice was governor Sarah Palin of Alaska, a former mayor of a town the size of the building where I grew up in New York. More recently, she has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/29/johnmccain.uselections2008\">performing her gubernatorial duties</a> for an entire 1.5 years since her election in November of 2006. In other words, compared to her, when it comes to foreign policy experience, Obama is practically Napoleon.</p> <p>Meanwhile, she is what you might call a bit slow on the uptake. When asked on CNBC's talkshow Kudlow &amp; Co about some of the vice-presidential speculation surrounding her only a month ago, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12969.html\">Palin's reaction</a> really speaks for itself:</p> <p>\"But as for that VP talk all the time, I'll tell ya, I still can't answer that question until somebody answers for me, what is it exactly that the VP does every day?\"</p> <p>Perhaps the vice-president, unlike Palin, might spend part of their day worrying about what to do about global warming rather than denying it, as she has.</p> <p>Making matters worse, Palin is currently <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/08/29/palin-corruption-investigation/\">under investigation</a> for pressuring Alaska's former public safety commissioner, Walt Monegan, to fire her former brother-in-law Mike Wooten from his job as a state trooper. Her sister was embroiled in a nasty divorce with Wooten, and when Monegan didn't investigate, he was fired from his job. Palin denied any involvement at first, yet has since <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/monegan/story/492964.html\">admitted that staff members contacted Monegan</a> about this matter. But she, of course, new nothing about it.</p> <p>The Alaska legislature, apparently filled with sentient beings, took that denial as seriously as you probably just did, and decided to <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/monegan/story/494556.html\">hire an independent investigator</a>.</p> <p>It is clear why McCain made this choice. He is hoping to win over still-angry Hillary Clinton supporters and other independent women, although when these women become aware of the fact that she believes abortion should be outlawed, voted for \u00fcber-right-wing commentator Pat Buchanan for president in 2000 and recently called senator Clinton a \"whiner\", well, many women may conclude that she just doesn't quite speak for them. </p> <p>They might also worry, like the rest of us, about a female Dan Quayle being a heartbeat away from the presidency. John McCain just turned 72 today (happy birthday senator!) and has had skin cancer.</p> <p>In the end, this is one more example of the real John McCain. He was against tax cuts for the wealthy before he was for them. He was against offshore oil drilling before he was for it. And he was against \"risking\" putting someone as untested as Obama in the White House, until he chose to put someone with the experience of Dudley Moore in the West Wing.</p>",
  "<p>While the rest of Alaska slept Thursday night, Alaska governor Sarah Palin went to bed knowing that she was going to be <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/26454655\">tapped by John McCain to be his vice-presidential running mate</a>. We had heard the rumours. Although many here were enchanted by the idea, few in this state took it very seriously. But then again, Palin has surprised us before.</p> <p>When she ran for governor in 2006, people said she didn't have the experience to run a state more than twice the size of Texas, a state where oil is king and where one of the biggest construction projects in the world - a natural gas pipeline that would run from Alaska's North Slope through Canada - was in the midst of being negotiated.</p> <p>Prior to being governor, she had been a commissioner on the state's oil and gas conservation commission, and a two-term mayor of Wasilla, a small town in a valley about 40 miles north of Anchorage. It's a place of wide-open spaces, of small strip malls and big trucks. It's a place whose people were once called by senator Ted Stevens's son, Ben Stevens, \"valley trash\".</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://dwb.adn.com/news/politics/elections/story/8337406p-8233470c.html\">she ran as a change candidate</a>, someone who would put an end to the good old boys' regime that had a stranglehold on Alaska for so many years. And people turned out in droves for her, shocking Alaska's political establishment, the same establishment that awoke shocked by the headlines this morning.</p> <p>She is plenty popular here. At a time when Alaska's image is been dominated by corrupt, white, male politicians, her killer smile, designer glasses and modern-sculpture-like hair have given us something to be proud of. And it's not just her looks. She's certainly the first female governor to have filled more than a few freezers with moose that she's shot, and to prefer caribou steaks to beef tenderloins.</p> <p>Her husband is part Alaska Native, a roughneck on the North Slope, and they both own a fish camp in rural Alaska. She has five children - one of whom is in the army and another who was born while she was in office and has Down's syndrome - and has displayed a willingness to take on Alaska's big oil companies by imposing on them a large windfall profits tax. She's also a Christian who attends an evangelical church and is avidly pro-life. All of that would seem to balance out the ticket nicely.<br> But she has no national political experience, and her two years as governor haven't all been easy. They've been particularly tough recently. Earlier this month, <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gWi6yTVfPyJeiTBsQ33SSUiobt8wD92I9NIO0\">state legislators opened a special investigation</a> into whether she'd fired Alaska's popular public safety commissioner because he refused to fire a trooper who is her ex-brother-in-law.<br> It may seem small stuff at a time when so many of Alaska's Republican politicians are in trouble for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/30/usa.uselections2008\">accepting bribes and gifts</a> from an oil services contract company, but emails coming from Palin's office are currently being subpoenaed and witnesses are being questioned.<br> The most likely outcome is that the investigation will show that her administration - largely dominated by fellow Wasillans, as well as her husband who is known to give the long stare to those who criticise her - has been incompetent, and Palin's snarky side will emerge.</p> <p>Palin may use words like \"golly\" and phrases like, \"bless your heart\", but she can be tough on her adversaries, of whom she has a few here. She giggled loudly on air when the hosts of a local radio talkshow called one of those adversaries - state Senate president Lyda Green - a \"cancer\" and a \"bitch\". Green is a cancer survivor.</p> <p>In an email, she also called another one of her enemies, Andrew Halcro, who ran against her in 2006, a <a href=\"http://www.andrewhalcro.com/has_anybody_seen_mr_open_and_mrs_transparency\">\"dumbass\"</a>. </p> <p>Once again, small stuff, and those of you in the Lower 48 and the rest of the world will likely think so, too. But it's taken some of the shine off of Palin's veneer here in Alaska. For an outsider with such little experience, running with a 72-year-old man who has had cancer, Palin will need to shine more brightly than the northern star.</p>",
  "<p>In Denver on Wednesday, on the outskirts of the other team's convention, a few elderly Republicans held a press conference to launch a new offensive: \"Not Ready '08\". The gaggle of party elders took to the airwaves to cast doubt on Barack Obama's preparedness for the top job in the land. Obama, <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/08/27/rudy.html\">Rudy Giuliani told us</a>, was \"woefully ill-prepared to be the next president\": too young, too inexperienced, too untested.</p> <p>It was a ridiculous argument on Wednesday. But it's particularly jarring today, now that John McCain has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/30/us/politics/29palin.html\">selected as his running mate</a> a politician who, just two years ago, was the <a href=\"http://www.cityofwasilla.com/\">mayor of Wasilla, Alaska</a> \u2013 population 8,471. Sarah Palin, <a href=\"http://gov.state.ak.us/bio.php\">Alaska's governor</a> since last year, may or may not have the political acumen to be one not-wholly-unlikely heart attack away from the Oval Office. But at a moment when McCain has sought to make hay from Obama's supposed weakness on foreign policy, a VP with zero experience in Washington seems at best bizarre. One <a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/Sarah_Palin.htm\">website that tracks elected officials' political views</a> has this entry for the governor under foreign policy: \"No issue stance yet recorded.\"</p> <p>So why pick the dark horse? Because, the defeatnik chorus will tell you, she is a woman, and an attractive one at that. But as an act of political calculus, the Palin move might not be as brilliant as some trembling Democrats fear. There was <a href=\"http://blog.macleans.ca/2008/08/28/will-mccain-pick-a-chick/\">no shortage of women</a> McCain could have chosen: Texas senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and former eBay chief executive Meg Whitman both had a shot at the number two spot on the ticket, and both would have provided an impressive counterbalance. To choose such an outsider, one of so few accomplishments, smacks of opportunism and, hopefully, won't stick. Whatever resentments linger among Hillary Clinton's advocates, to suggest that soft Obama supporters can be hoodwinked into voting for a pair of pro-life politicians \u2013 he quietly so, she profoundly \u2013 doesn't reflect the reality of American politics; it isn't just sexist but naive.</p> <p>For the moment the media have a new darling, and in the coming days we will here endless loops of how the self-professed \"hockey mom\" made the brave decision to carry her fifth child to term despite his Down syndrome \u2013 a major plus with those conservatives who threatened to rebel when the pro-choice Tom Ridge was mooted. But Palin's shine will dull quickly. In America, Alaska's nickname is \"The Last Frontier\" \u2014 and the state has a reputation for some of the dirtiest politics in the country. It's Alaska that gave us Ted Stevens, the recently indicted senator who took buckets of money from oil companies, some of which paid for his home renovations. How did Palin, the self-professed reformer, <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/news/politics/story/478749.html\">react to Stevens' indictment</a>? By saying he had \"dedicated his life to the betterment of the state.\"</p> <p>I wonder whether the Republicans' veep choice, a woman younger than Obama, will seem so appealing to undecided voters when national media pick up on the central feature of her brief career as Alaska's governor: her alleged scheming to get her ex-brother-in-law fired from his job as a state trooper. Palin pressured one of her officials to sack the guy, who was involved in a messy custody battle with her sister; when the commissioner refused, she <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/monegan/story/478090.html\">booted him from office</a>. Now Palin won't be around Juneau while an independent investigator looks into the affair and her seeming abuse of power. Instead she'll be on the campaign trail, asking Americans to believe, seriously, that she has the wisdom and rectitude to stand first in line to succeed to the presidency.</p>",
  "<h2>Mitt Romney</h2> <p>Had Mitt Romney been picked, it would've been akin to Barack Obama choosing Hillary Clinton for his running mate. Romney, former governor of Massachusetts, was McCain's chief rival for the Republican nomination, and as such spent several months savaging the Arizona senator in debates and in the press. He bowed out of the race in February and spent the ensuing months currying favour with conservatives.</p> <p>The scion of a prominent Michigan political family \u2013 his father was governor of the state \u2013 Romney spent his early adulthood as a Mormon missionary in France. He was heralded for his management of the 2002 winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, and grew extremely wealthy as a venture capitalist. Elected governor of Massachusetts in 2002, he governed as a moderate \u2013 necessary in that liberal state.</p> <p>Romney is acclaimed for his business acumen and can speak fluently on the economy \u2013 an admitted weakness for McCain. His ties to Michigan may have helped win that crucial swing state, which has not voted Republican since 1988.</p> <p>But in the wake of McCain's \"houses\" gaffe \u2013 the senator was unable to tell a reporter how many homes he and his wife, heiress to a beer distributing company, own \u2013 the Republican party may have been reluctant to present a ticket with two extremely wealthy men. Romney is also perceived as unfriendly to workers, having presided over layoffs during his tenure in the private sector.</p> <p>Another strike against Romney is his Mormon faith. The evangelical Christian faction of the Republican party, powerful in recent years, already distrusts McCain.</p> <p>Some conservatives remain distrustful of Romney's commitment to social conservative fundamentals like opposition to abortion rights and gay rights. Massachusetts is one of the most liberal states in the union, and during the Republican primary, Romney was criticised for backing a universal healthcare programme in the state during his tenure as governor.</p> <h2>Tim Pawlenty</h2> <p>Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty's staid reputation and uncharismatic manner mask a self-deprecating sense of humour: in spring, he praised his wife's willingness to watch hockey games with him, but said 'Now, if I could only get her to have sex with me.'\"</p> <p>Crass jokes aside, Pawlenty had many attributes favourable among the Republican base: long-time attendance at an evangelical church, consistent conservative stances on social issues, and opposition to tax increases. He also has the blue-collar background much sought after among American politicians. That presents a marked contrast to McCain, the son and grandson of admirals. </p> <p>At 47, his relative youth would have provided a needed contrast to McCain's advanced age, and he is fresh on the national scene. Minnesota has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate in recent memory, but in 2004 chose Democrat John Kerry by 51% to 48%. </p> <p>Pawlenty was first elected governor in 2002. He won re-election in 2006 by a narrow margin, leading national Republicans to question his popularity in his home state. Also, he is an unproven debater, while Joe Biden, Barack Obama's running mate, is skilled and experienced.</p> <h2>Joseph Lieberman</h2> <p>This Connecticut senator would have surely shaken things up in the race. He is a career-long Democrat who split with the party in 2006 over the Iraq war, and he is an orthodox Jew. But he is well used to the rigours of a vice-presidential campaign, having run alongside Democrat Al Gore in 2000 and come within a hair's breadth of the White House. Lieberman and McCain also enjoy a friendly personal relationship and the two have travelled together extensively. </p> <p>A McCain-Lieberman ticket would've also blunted one of the Democrats' major campaign themes \u2013 that the Republican party failed the nation in eight years in power and it is time to replace them.</p> <p>But the Connecticut senator had several major drawbacks. For one, many Republicans simply won't trust a former Democrat on the ticket and would be unenthusiastic. An independent senator, Lieberman votes with the Democrats on most issues and has amassed a moderate voting record. Also, as a supporter of abortion rights and an orthodox Jew, he could have clashed with social conservative voters.</p> <p>A former state attorney general, Lieberman was first elected to the senate in 1988. He won re-election in 2006 as an independent after being defeated in the Democratic primary by an antiwar candidate.</p> <h2>Eric Cantor</h2> <p>This young Virginia congressman took part in early August in a conference call with reporters to attack Barack Obama's energy plan, leading to speculation he was auditioning to be McCain's running mate.</p> <p>At 45, Cantor is relatively inexperienced, first winning election to the US House of Representatives in 2000. But he could've added much-needed youth to the Republican ticket, and he is good looking and would have been presented as a Washington outsider.</p> <h2>Tom Ridge</h2> <p>The former Pennsylvania governor may have helped deliver that key swing state and as the first secretary of homeland security under President George Bush, can claim national security credentials. Ridge was a US congressman from 1983 to 1995, then served six years as governor of Pennsylvania before moving to Washington to be a homeland security adviser.</p> <p>But Ridge is a supporter of abortion rights. Conservative leaders have warned that Ridge on the ticket would've been disastrous for McCain's chances in the fall, as anti-abortion Republicans would be inclined to stay home instead of rally for the candidate.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's foreign secretary, David Miliband, has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/davidmiliband.ukraine\">lecturing Russia</a> on the need to respect Ukrainian and Georgian sovereignty. He doesn't seem to realise how incongruous this sounds to much of the world, given Britain's own disregard of international law.</p> <p>In a similar vein, our former prime minister, Tony Blair, also caused wry smiles earlier this month when he <a href=\"http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Saturday/National/2310018/Article/index_html\"> visited Malaysia</a> to give the Universiti Malaya's 22nd Sultan Azlan Shah lecture on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYkyaJhfmo0\">Upholding the Rule of Law: A Reflection</a>.</p> <p>Blair argued that this means \"rules and procedures that are transparent, and rules of evidence that make sense and are fair. These basic principles apply universally and without them, the rule of law means little or nothing.\"</p> <p>As you can imagine, the topic Blair sought to address was a source of both amusement and disbelief among the Malaysians.</p> <p>This is what the vice-chancellor of Universiti Sains Malaysia, <a href=\"http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/opinions/comments/dzulkifli_abdul_razak_irony_of_blair_s_rule_of_law.html\">Dzulkifli Abdul Razak</a>, had to say: \"It is quite obvious from casual observation that someone who has been known to have misled others, including the country's parliament, has lost the moral authority to preach about the rule of law and good governance \u2026 One wonders then what 'basic principles' Blair had in mind when he gave an almost unconditional support for the unilateral decision to invade Iraq against the wishes of the international community and without the approval of the UN \u2026 Indeed, as late as April 2006, when an eminent British former law lord attacked Guantanamo Bay as 'a stain on American justice', Blair reportedly refused to follow suit. According to Lord Steyn, who just retired from Britain's highest court: 'While our government condones Guantanamo Bay, the world is perplexed about our approach to the rule of law. You may ask: how will it help in regard to the continuing outrage at Guantanamo Bay for our government now to condemn it. The answer is that it would at last be a powerful signal to the world that Britain supports the international rule of law.'\"</p> <p>The former Malaysian prime minister, <a href=\"http://test.chedet.com/che_det/2008/08/blair-and-the-conspiracy-of-si.html\">Mahathir Mohamad</a>, was characteristically blunt: \"It is disgusting to see this criminal of the highest order being welcomed in Malaysia and worse still to talk on the rule of law when he broke all international laws and the laws of his own country by deliberately lying and sending young British soldiers to die in a war of aggression.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90777/90851/6464630.html\">Mahathir added</a> that: \"Saddam has been hanged, Karadzic was recently arrested, but this man goes around the world, lecturing on the rule of law.\"</p> <p>Roger Tan, a member of the Malaysian Bar Council, asked if, \"by supporting and participating in the 2003 United States-led invasion and occupation of Iraq, I wonder whether Britain, being the world's oldest democracy, still possesses moral authority in a comity of nations to lecture on the principle of rule of law.\"</p> <p>I visited the <a href=\"http://tonyblairoffice.org/\">official Tony Blair website</a> to read his own account of what had transpired in Malaysia. Unfortunately, I could find no mention made of the trip.</p>",
  "<p>England continued their dreamlike end to the summer with a crushing 126-run defeat of South Africa at The Oval to take the series 3-0 with two matches still to play.</p> <p>Samit Patel was the star for England with an exceptional allround performance in only his fourth ODI, scoring 33 to help Andrew Flintoff repair a stuttering innings and guide England to 296 and then taking 5 for 41 as the South Africans subsided to 170 all out in reply.</p> <p>In truth, the South Africans never looked like getting close to England's total. Missing their inspirational captain Graeme Smith, and with an inexperienced top order that leant heavily on the out-of-form Jacques Kallis, they were in trouble from the moment that Herschelle Gibbs spooned Jimmy Anderson to Owais Shah at short cover in the seventh over.</p> <p>Hashim Amla then nicked Steve Harmison through to Matt Prior via the inside-edge, and when Kallis's miserable run continued with a painfully mistimed pull off Flintoff, the die was cast at 77 for 3 from 19 overs. Patel took the catch that dismissed Kallis, a high, swirling effort on the run that was by no means a formality, and would take centre stage with the ball from the moment AB de Villiers had suicidally run himself out.</p> <p>Patel took five of the final six wickets to fall to become the first England spinner to take five wickets in an ODI since Ashley Giles in Delhi in 2001-02, and the first in this country for 25 years. His first wicket came when he bowled Mark Boucher with an arm-ball and he followed this with a superb return catch to remove Albie Morkel after the allrounder had brutalised him for two sixes earlier in the over.</p> <p>Morne Morkel then hoicked Patel to Stuart Broad in the deep, and when Johan Botha played on Patel was in sight of his milestone. Makhaya Ntini provided scant resistance, edging to Matt Prior behind the stumps to make Patel and England's day.</p> <p>Earlier, Ian Bell and Prior had got England's innings off to a rocketing start with a stand of 101 in only 15 overs \u2013 Ntini typifying the South Africans' chaotic approach in one over that contained consecutive no-balls and a wide. Bell had little sympathy, later taking him for 14 from three balls as he confounded recent criticism of his scoring rate by racing to 50 from only 36 balls. When a wicket finally came it was the comparatively becalmed Prior who fell for 33, the 12th time in 26 ODIs he has scored between 30 and 50, as the Morkel brothers brought some control to the South African attack. </p> <p>Prior's dismissal triggered a mid-innings lull for England, with ten overs bringing only 38 runs and four wickets. Johan Botha outfoxed Bell with a quicker delivery to trap him lbw for 77, before the captain Kallis struck with his first delivery to bowl the stuttering Owais Shah. South Africa scented blood, and what seemed the crucial wicket was not long in coming, Kevin Pietersen lbw to Kallis for only five as he shuffled across his stumps.</p> <p>Flintoff, relishing the responsibility afforded him by his captain, overcame the loss of Paul Collingwood at 182 for five to lead the recovery with in a stand of 74 with the newcomer Patel. Patel announced himself to international cricket with a mature innings in support of Flintoff, mixing adroit strike-rotation with decisive pulls and drives to suggest a promising future.</p> <p>When Patel fell with just under five overs remaining and the score on 256, Luke Wright joined Flintoff to lift England to just shy of the 300 that seemed a bare minimum after their excellent start. Flintoff finished unbeaten on a run-a-ball 78, having received a nasty blow from a Morne Morkel bouncer, to provide further evidence that his batting is once again in rude health.</p>",
  "<p>New strip: published in The Observer in August 2008. Click to enlarge.</p> <p>Keith Hackett's official answers. <br><strong>1)</strong> No goal. The defenders are correct, and your assistant is wrong: it is clearly offside. This type of rapid, intense incident underpins the need for referees and assistants to have a thorough knowledge of the laws of the game, and how to apply them quickly and accurately, under pressure. As a referee, you must also be confident and alert enough to overrule your assistant when necessary. <br><strong>2)</strong> Play advantage, and give the goal. Again, a potentially confusing situation, but the striker who has headed the ball into the goal \u2013 albeit involuntarily \u2013 has done so while being fouled. So, seeing the violent incident, and the ball flying towards the net, you should apply the advantage rule and award the goal once the ball has crossed the line. You would then show his colleague a red card for an act of violent conduct, and restart with a normal kick-off. <br><strong>3)</strong> No goal. It's not the striker's fault, but the loss of his boot means you must apply Law 8 \u2013 dropped ball. You should stop play, disallow the goal and restart with a dropped ball at the point where the boot made contact with the ball. </p> <p>To submit a new question email <a href=\"mailto:you.are.the.ref@observer.co.uk\">you.are.the.ref@observer.co.uk</a>, or post it below.

  "<p>This summer's misery for energy consumers continued today when the last two of the big six suppliers raised prices for millions of households.</p> <p>Scottish Power, which has just over 5 million customers, said its gas bills would rise by 34% from the beginning of next month while electricity customers would see a 9% rise in prices. Npower said it was putting up its gas prices by 26% and electricity by 14% for its 6.6 million customers with immediate effect.</p> <p>The latest increases come amid growing calls for a windfall tax on energy companies to help the increasing numbers of households struggling to cope with rising bills at a time when food and fuel costs are also increasing.</p> <p>Today, a coalition of Age Concern, Child Poverty Action Group and National Energy Action increased the pressure on the government by demanding measures to make social tariffs for energy fairer and more effective.<br>The coalition warned that 5.5 million households were likely to face fuel poverty - defined as spending more than 10% of income on heating and lighting - this winter.</p> <p>Age Concern responded sharply to the latest increases. The director general, Gordon Lishman, said: \"Many pensioners, already worrying about whether they can afford to heat their homes this winter, will be outraged by news of yet more colossal price hikes. It is a huge worry that one in three pensioner households are likely to be living in fuel poverty by the end of 2008 and many are already feeling forced to cut back on essential food or fuel.\"</p> <p>Tim Wolfenden, the head of home services at the comparison website uSwitch.com, said: \"The industry-wide shift to higher household energy prices is now complete. All the major suppliers have increased prices for a second time this year \u2013 this is a heavy blow and few households will emerge unscathed or unconcerned about the future affordability of their energy. </p> <p>The government is expected to respond within the next few days, although it remains unclear how any further help will be funded. An extra \u00a3225m from companies for social programmes for poorer customers over the next three years was announced earlier this year, but the companies now face demands to go further. </p> <p>The government is said to be wary of slapping a windfall tax on the sector at a time when the industry is facing the challenge of stumping up more than \u00a3100bn to invest in more renewable methods of power generation and the replacement of ageing nuclear power plants and coal-fired stations that will have to close under European legislation.</p> <p>One suggestion is that the government may seek to increase the proportion of permits to emit carbon dioxide that firms are forced to buy under the European Union's emissions trading scheme from the current 7% to 10% - a move opposed by power generators who use fossil fuel. </p> <p>Earlier this summer, EDF Energy, British Gas, E.ON and Scottish and Southern Energy all raised their prices. The latest round of increases is the second by the big six this year. It takes the average household bill on standard plans for gas and electricity combined to between \u00a31,200 and more than \u00a31,300, depending on the supplier, according to uSwitch.com. At the beginning of the year, dual fuel bills with all six were well below \u00a31,000.</p> <p>The companies blame the rising cost of wholesale gas and power prices for the increases for residential customers. Gas prices are linked to oil prices because of the UK's increasing dependence on imports from continental Europe, where gas contracts are often indexed to the price of oil. International coal prices have also risen sharply.</p> <p>Today, ScottishPower, which is owned by Spain's Iberdrola, said coal prices had risen by 45% since February, while wholesale gas prices had climbed 65% and electricity by 55% over the same period. By contrast, it said, its own prices for dual fuel users would rise on average of 25%.</p> <p>Willie MacDiarmid, Scottish Power's director of energy retail, said: \"These are difficult times and we understand the financial impact this announcement will have on our customers. Although we're one of the last companies to announce increases we're sorry we couldn't hold on any longer. However we have worked very hard to protect people for as long as possible from these considerable increases in the wholesale market.\"</p> <p>Giuseppe Di Vita, the npower managing director, said the decision had been taken \"extremely reluctantly, especially as household budgets are being squeezed so much at the moment.\"</p>",

It's quite the amazing run, even if you give them this season's Milk Cup wins against Preston and Basingstoke Town Youth XI. So amazing, in fact, that it's a small wonder Jewell hasn't been chased out of Derbyshire by a determined psychopath wielding a pointed stick, or had a steak rubbed on his harris just before a pack of rabid dogs were set on him, or even been quietly issued with his P45 and other appropriate paperwork before being escorted off the premises with about as much dignity as everyone concerned can salvage in this extremely embarrassing situation.</p> <p>Just how hapless Jewell's administration has become can be illustrated by the events of this week. Given that the aforementioned Milk Cup win at Preston occurred this Tuesday, you would have thought the week was a good one. But far from it. First Jewell was forced to deny that he selected Paul Connolly as captain for the game by picking the player's name from a hat. \"It's trying to ridicule myself, the team and the club, which is ridiculous,\" said Jewell, conjugating furiously. \"It's rank bad journalism if someone thinks that is exactly how I picked the captain,\" he added. Well, rank bad journalism is what the Fiver is all about, which is why we can't work out whether this statement was a straight denial, or simply a hint that he had picked Connolly's name from a flat cap, and not a hat.</p> <p>If that wasn't bad enough, Jewell then found himself a leading character in a news story that appears to have been scripted by Brian Rix. Having refused defender Tyrone Mears permission to talk to Marseille, Jewell sat in his office unawares as Mears climbed through a window and tiptoed past Jewell's door in order to get his boots, before catching the first flight to the south of France for a trial. Sadly for Mears, Derby were unimpressed with Marseille's offer of a two-day trial with the possibility of a free loan - calling it \"completely and utterly unacceptable\" and \"laughable\" - and so Mears now faces disciplinary action by the club. Which is slightly unfair as, by breaking into the ground like he did, Mears inadvertently did his best to raise the profile of one of the club's funders. According to Derby's official website, he is \"proudly sponsored by AJC Windows &amp; Conservatories\", for all your see-through wall needs.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Any sentences already written for the weekend's papers featuring the words \"Dimitar\" \"Berbatov\" \"Manchester\" and \"United\" or \"Robinho\" and \"Chelsea\" have now had the word \"not\" hastily inserted into them.</p> <p>After spending much of the summer hawking his dusters, jay-cloths and defensive midfielders outside the Emirates, Miguel Veloso's agent has gone round the block to pester the housewives of White Hart Lane.</p> <p>And Martin O'Neill wants Standard Liege's Marouane Fellaini to bolster Aston Villa's sub-standard midfield.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Knack-prone striker Louis Saha will be staying at Manchester United now that Everton have decided to sign him for an undisclosed fee ... subject to a medical.</p> <p>Interesting ties thrown up by this morning's Euro Vase first-round draw: Napoli v Benfica.</p> <p>Other ties thrown up by this morning's Euro Vase first-round draw: Hertha Berlin v St Patrick's Athletic, Portsmouth v Guimaraes, Human Rights FC v Omonia Nicosia, AS Nancy v Motherwell, Everton v Standard Li\u00e8ge, Litex Lovech v Aston Villa, Rennes v Shecond-Choish Shteve, Tottenham v Wisla Krakow.</p> <p>England's Under-21est international, James Milner, 22, has been granted parole from Newcastle and has hightailed it to a club believed to be in the region of Aston for a fee believed to be in the region of \u00a310m. \"I just want to make it absolutely clear that at the end of the day, it was my decision to sell him,\" chirruped Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan, prompting assembled hacks to smile benignly as if humouring a small child who was claiming to have seen Father Christmas.</p> <p>Fabio Capello will have to find some other way of amusing himself in Monaco this evening now that ongoing knee-knack has forced curly-haired Canadian Owen Hargreaves to pull out of Manchester United's Massive Cup encounter with Zenit St Petersburg.</p> <p>The Fiver wishes it was as poverty-stricken as cash-strapped Human Rights FC, who are about to spend \u00a36.5m on Espanyol's Argentina international Pablo Zabaleta.</p> <p>The Queen's Celtic striker Shaun Maloney may not have made it in the Premier League, but he make it to Queen's Celtic Park to face the Pope's O'Rangers in Sunday's Euro Disney League title-decider after shaking off unspecified knack.</p> <p>And Nantes winger Djamel Abdoun has been diagnosed with a broken jaw after being kicked in the chops by team-mate Stefan Babovic.

  "<p>Jonathan Steele's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/25/georgia.russia\">commentary</a> on the Russia-Georgia conflict is ensnared in the same traps that it purports to condemn. Not content to skate over the facts \u2013 such as they are known \u2013 he adds insult to Georgian injury with a generalised attack on the Georgian national character. This may be the level of debate one expects of the Russian media, but not elsewhere.</p> <p>Mikheil Saakashvili's decision to <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7546639.stm\">launch an attack</a> on South Ossetian positions was certainly ill-considered, but it is not right to imply, as Steele does, that it was taken on a capricious whim. This conflict has been simmering for years and that both sides have engaged in sporadic attacks against each other.</p> <p>The context of this month's sudden expansion of the conflict goes back several months and includes a series of provocative acts by the Russians in Georgia's other breakaway province of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3261059.stm\">Abkhazia</a>. But it was the circumstances immediately before August 7 that tripped the Georgians into precipitate action. </p> <p>For the first time in many years, the Ossetians began artillery and mortar-fire attacks on Georgian villages in South Ossetia, ignored a Georgian appeal for a ceasefire and began evacuating women and children to Russia in the north. At the same time, Murat Kulakhbekov, the Russian commander of the peacekeeping forces, told the Georgians that he could no longer control the Ossetians. On the night of the August 7, the Georgians say the Russians began moving large numbers of troops and armour through the Roki tunnel into South Ossetia.<br> Steele also ridicules the notion that Saakashvili fell into a trap. The truth of the matter is that the Americans had been warning him since the spring to keep turning the other cheek in the face of persistent provocations \u2013 to begin with in Abkhazia, but since July, in South Ossetia as well. And the notion of a trap does not stem solely from the western side. I had many conversations with Russian soldiers in Georgia last week and several told me and others that they had been preparing for this for weeks.</p> <p>Just like <a href=\"http://www.b92.net/eng/news/world-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=08&amp;dd=29&amp;nav_id=53069\">Vladimir Putin</a>, Steele seeks to draw an analogy with Kosovo. There are several differences. First, Georgia has not sought to undermine South Ossetia's autonomy, apart from a brief period of madness under <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zviad_Gamsakhurdia\">Zviad Gamsakhurdia</a> in the early 1990s. On the contrary, it is offering the Ossetians extensive autonomous rights. Secondly, almost a third of villages in South Ossetia are Georgian, while many of the others are mixed. Separating them, except by ethnic cleansing, is well-nigh impossible. And thirdly, while Nato attacked Kosovo to prevent ethnic cleansing, Russia's attack on Georgia has been followed by ethnic cleansing.</p> <p>Steele asks how the Americans would have reacted if Serbia's leaders had suddenly killed US peacekeepers in Kosovo. Well, nobody suddenly killed anyone in South Ossetia. This had been coming from a long way back. And part of the reason for that was that the Russian peacekeepers were anything but. At very best, they sought to freeze the conflict, and at worst, they openly took the Ossetian side. Furthermore, the peacekeeping force in South Ossetia was disproportionately weighted against the Georgians as it consisted in equal parts of Russians, South Ossetians, North Ossetians and Georgians. This is one reason why the Georgians wanted to internationalise the peacekeeping operation. Needless to say, the Russians consistently opposed the idea.</p> <p>He says too that Russia's destruction of Georgia's military and economic infrastructure was remarkably like Nato's destruction of Serbia's. But, ignoring the obvious difference in scale, it needs to be pointed out too that the destruction of Serbia's infrastructure came before Serbia agreed to sign a ceasefire, while Russia's wilful destruction of Georgia has continued long after Saakashvili signed a ceasefire and withdrew his troops.</p> <p>Steele ought to know all this. If he doesn't, he most certainly does know that in October 1999, the Russians launched a ground offensive against their breakaway province of Chechnya after an air offensive of mindless brutality that killed thousands of innocent Russians citizens in Grozny and elsewhere. The grounds for their attack were pretty much the same as those used by the Georgians. Strangely, nowhere does this get a mention in his piece. Instead, our credulity is stretched to the limits by the suggestion that the Russians invaded Georgia this month to help the Ossetians.</p> <p>Steele also presents as one of the abiding images of the South Ossetian crisis the moving <a href=\"http://www.mnweekly.ru/national/20080828/55343669.html\">concert</a> given in the ruins of Tskhinvali by Valery Gergiev and the Mariinsky orchestra. Moving to some, perhaps, but not to the thousands of Georgian refugees being ethnically cleansed at that very moment from their villages in South Ossetia \u2013 nor to Georgian villagers being held at that very moment in a pen within earshot of the concert.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337063085\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Specialist teams hoping to examine the fire-ruined home of missing millionaire Christopher Foster have restarted their search after being forced to withdraw earlier because of falling masonry and other debris.</p> <p>Officers are keen to establish whether human remains are present in the burnt-out shell of the seven-bedroom mansion amid concern over the whereabouts of Foster, his wife, Jill, 49, and their daughter Kirstie, 15.</p> <p>After shoring up the building, forensic experts were able to re-enter the property and begin the painstaking process of sifting thorough the contents of the house.</p> <p>The head of the inquiry, Superintendent Gary Higgins, of West Mercia police, today said the task of searching the building would take days if not weeks.</p> <p>\"Officers have completed a search of the outbuildings and are in the process of removing vehicles from the site,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Forensic specialists will begin the lengthy, painstaking process of sifting and examining all of the contents.\"</p> <p>Experts carried out autopsies yesterday on the bodies of three horses found close to the shells of four luxury cars in a stable block separate from Foster's main mansion but set ablaze at the same time.</p> <p>Higgins said detectives were sure the fire had been started deliberately but would not confirm that gun cartridges and pools of blood had been found outside the buildings on the family's four hectare (10 acre) estate at Maesbrook, near Oswestry, Shropshire.</p> <p>He repeated appeals for any sightings of the family since the start of the bank holiday weekend. Foster's daughter had been on holiday from her boarding school at nearby Ellesmere at the time of the fire. </p> <p>All three returned to the house on Monday night, hours before the blazes erupted at 4am. They had spent the evening at a barbecue given by a Shropshire car dealer, and were said to have been in good spirits.</p> <p>Police maintained a cordon round fields and woods at the estate, Osbaston House, which dates from the 17th century. A cherrypicker platform has been used to remove tiles from a teetering roof and to scan the smouldering wreckage.</p> <p>A watch also remains in place on ports and airports for Foster, who was described by an appeal court judge in May as an asset-stripper who was \"not to be trusted\".</p> <p>Neighbours said he was rarely seen except in one of his fleet of cars, often heading for shooting parties with businessmen who had bought similar properties on the picturesque border with Wales. </p> <p>Terence Baines, a former accountant at Foster's thermal insulation firm Ulva Ltd, which went into liquidation a year ago, said: \"He liked to live life big, with holidays and cars.\"</p> <p>Foster's complex financial dealings had become an increasing matter of comment after court hearings that questioned his business morality. The high court and later Lord Justice Rimmer in the appeal court condemned a series of manoeuvres by Foster in a prolonged attempt to avoid \u00a3800,000 damages from a breach of contract with a distribution company.</p> <p>But friends and business contacts described Foster as congenial man, devoted to his family. The \u00a31.2m mansion had been equipped with every luxury, and two of the horses were bought at high prices earlier this year for Foster and Kirstie to ride.</p> <p>Police attempted to quash rumours about the cause of the fire and would not comment on reports that a horsebox with deflated tyres had been left behind the mansion's electronic gates to delay rescuers.</p> <p>The Foster family had devoted much time and money to their home, constructing a lake, planting trees and raising sheep, ducks and hens, as well as keeping the horses. Four dogs are also missing and the gutted remains of Mrs Foster's 4x4, whose personalised number plate JILL40 was familiar locally, stand on the gravel drive.</p> <p>Internet messages from friends paid tribute to Kirstie and hoped for her speedy appearance. The headteacher of Ellesmere College, Brendan Wignall, said: \"We are very concerned for the safety of Kirstie and her family, who are in our thoughts and prayers. <br>She is a charming, popular and hard-working girl with many friends, all of whom are hoping that she and her family will be found safe and well.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Chicago. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Lupe Martinez (vocals, guitar), Jorge Ledezma (production, guitar), Angel Ledezma (drums), Ria Neri (bass), James Warden (keyboards). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> Tall and tanned and young and lovely. But enough about the New Band of the Day writer. These girls and boys are not from Ipanema; nevertheless, the spirits of Astrud Gilberto, Jo\u00e3o Gilberto and Stan Getz live on in this outfit. All\u00e1 (Spanish for \"over there\") are a trio (plus additional musicians) of Mexican-Americans from Chicago - the second-largest Mexican immigrant community in the US, after Los Angeles \u2013 who are in love with bossa nova and the ba-ba-ba's of easy listening and lounge pop. Only they have a tendency, like their most obvious European counterparts Stereolab and St Etienne, to take soft and sappy MOR and ally it to stranger, more experimental sounds and textures: elements of symphonic pop, the Brazilian Tropicalia movement, krautrock, electronica, psychedelia, space jazz and post-rock can be heard in their music. Their debut album is titled Es Tiempo, which means \"it's time\", and there is a greater degree of vitality, if not revolutionary urgency, to this project. Take a cursory listen to the superficially pleasant grooves of the Ledezma brothers and the gentle, breathy coos and ahhs of singer Lupe Martinez and you might regard it as blandly buoyant. Closer inspection will reveal a myriad of delights. One of their tracks, El Movimiento, is equals parts motorik and Motown, with found sounds, samples and weird FX, making it, like the album as a whole, a sort of chilled-out counterpart to Byrne-Eno's My Life in the Bush of Ghosts. If the music is deceptively lightweight, it might also lead you to assume the words are romantic pabulum. Far from it: the Mexican immigrant experience and inner-city pressures are as likely to concern them as love and spiritual awakening.<br> Something of a labour of love \u2013 or labor de amor, if you happen to meet the band on your travels and want to impress them - Es Tiempo was entirely financed by Jorge Ledezma, who had to suffer the ignominy of getting a day job and moving back in with his parents so that he could save up the money to make his masterpiece. Several years and a reported $40,000 later, work on Es Tiempo could begin. Produced by Ledezma and engineered by Colin Studybaker (Iron &amp; Wine, National Trust), recording took place in various venues, including post-rock majordomo John McEntire's Soma Electronic Studios and the famed Tambourine Studios in Sweden where some of the music was tracked and all the string and horn arrangements were \"laid down\" (technical term) with arranger Patrik (the Cardigans) Bartosch. Actually, $40,000 seems cheap: much of Es Tiempo sounds like a million dollars, from the lavish Bacharach-goes-disco of Un Dia Otra Noche to the sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of cosmic Latino, sampladelic flamenco, lush acoustica , tribal muzak and jazzy drones found elsewhere on this terrific record. </p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"All\u00e1 are great, All\u00e1 are gorgeous, All\u00e1 be with you!\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> \u00a1Now That's What We Call M\u00fasica!<br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Make Bob Stanley flip his (Pete) Wiggs and Sarah Cracknell crackers. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Sound good on Worthing seafront. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Es Tiempo is out now on Crammed Discs.<br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Stereolab, Komeda, El Guincho, St Etienne.<br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/estiempo\">www.myspace.com/estiempo</a><br> <strong><br>Monday's new band:</strong> James Yuill.</p>",
  "<p>The Democratic Unionist party and Sinn F\u00e9in clashed today after a republican minister published a government document replacing all references to Northern Ireland with the preferred nationalist label \"the North\". </p> <p>Peter Robinson, the DUP leader and Ulster first minister, accused Sinn F\u00e9in minister Conor Murphy of bad faith, but republicans dismissed the criticism and claimed it had more to do with internal unionist tensions. </p> <p>The row is the latest sign of friction between the parties, who are supposed to be agreeing a date for talks on the more substantial issue of devolving policing and justice powers to Stormont. </p> <p>Republicans claimed that the DUP was running scared after the use of nationalist language was first spotted by former DUP member and leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice party Jim Allister. </p> <p>In a leaked letter, Robinson said he was seeking legal advice after Murphy altered an agreed strategy document on regional development in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Today the DUP denied being influenced by the TUV and claimed important changes had been made to the document, but Sinn F\u00e9in assembly member John O'Dowd dismissed this. </p> <p>\"Aside from the fact that Peter Robinson has no authority to write any letter on any subject on behalf of OFMDFM [the office of first and deputy first minister] without the agreement of Sinn F\u00e9in, people will be amazed that at a time when there are real outstanding issues to resolve Mr Robinson has the time to play petty politics,\" said <br>O'Dowd. </p> <p>\"The Regional Development Strategy produced by DRD [the Department of Regional Development] is an accurate reflection of what was agreed at executive level. </p> <p>\"The background to this letter is a query made by rejectionist MEP Jim Allister. The pattern seems to be: Jim Allister raises an issue and it becomes a DUP priority. It is weak politics and no way to do business.\" </p> <p>Robinson shares the office of first and deputy first minister with Sinn F\u00e9in's Martin McGuinness. </p> <p>The two parties are split on a series of issues, including the transfer of justice powers to Northern Ireland, the future of the Maze prison site and the introduction of an Irish language act. </p> <p>The dispute has prevented cabinet meetings, but Robinson has threatened serious consequences if a meeting scheduled for September 18 does not go ahead. </p> <p>The DUP is also in the middle of an election battle where one of its government ministers, Arlene Foster, is battling to hold on to a DUP seat on Fermanagh district council. </p>",
  "<p>Picking the Alaska governor is a bold play from John McCain for the potentially millions of disaffected Hillary Clinton voters who have remained impervious to Democrats' pleas for party unity. She presents a new face unfamiliar to most of America, and is likely to stir up the race and excite the news media. </p> <p>At 44, she is a youthful addition to the Republican ticket. Palin is an avid fisher and hunter, a member of the politically powerful National Rifle Association, and her husband has native-American roots.</p> <p>But Palin brings several risks. She has been in office less than two years, and would be hard pressed to go toe-to-toe in debate with Democratic vice-presidential nominee Joe Biden, a veteran senator and foreign policy expert. </p> <p>The Democrats will also raise questions about whether Palin passes the \"commander-in-chief test\" - that is, would she be able to assume the presidency should McCain, 72, become incapacitated. The news media may also seek to tie Palin to longtime Alaska Republican senator Ted Stevens, who is under indictment on corruption charges.</p> <p>Before taking office in December 2006, Palin served two terms as mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, and was on the city's council before that.</p> <h2>The others on McCain's shortlist</h2> <p><strong>Mitt Romney</strong></p> <p>If Mitt Romney had been picked, it would have been akin to Barack Obama choosing Hillary Clinton for his running mate. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, was McCain's chief rival for the Republican nomination, and as such spent several months savaging the Arizona senator in debates and in the press. </p> <p>The scion of a prominent Michigan political family \u2013 his father was governor of the state \u2013 Romney spent his early adulthood as a Mormon missionary in France. He was praised for his management of the 2002 winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, and grew extremely wealthy as a venture capitalist. Elected governor of Massachusetts in 2002, he governed as a moderate \u2013 necessary in that liberal state.</p> <p>Romney is acclaimed for his business acumen and can speak fluently on the economy \u2013 an admitted weakness for McCain. </p> <p>But in the wake of McCain's \"houses\" gaffe \u2013 the senator was unable to tell a reporter how many homes he and his wife, heiress to a beer distributing company, own \u2013 the Republican party may have been reluctant to present a ticket made up of two extremely wealthy men. </p> <p><strong>Tim Pawlenty</strong></p> <p>Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty's staid reputation and uncharismatic manner mask a self-deprecating sense of humour: in spring, he praised his wife's willingness to watch hockey games with him, but said: \"Now, if I could only get her to have sex with me.\"</p> <p>Crass jokes aside, Pawlenty potentially brought many attributes favourable among the Republican base: long-time attendance at an evangelical church, consistent conservative stances on social issues, and opposition to tax increases. He also has the blue-collar background much sought after among American politicians. That presents a marked contrast to McCain, the son and grandson of admirals. </p> <p>Some Republicans had hoped that having Pawlenty on the ticket could have put his state in play. Minnesota has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate in recent memory, but in 2004 chose Democrat John Kerry by 51% to 48%. </p> <p>But while Pawlenty was first elected governor in 2002, he won re-election in 2006 by a narrow margin, leading national Republicans to question his popularity in his home state. Also, he was an unproven debater, while Joe Biden, Barack Obama's running mate, is skilled and experienced.</p> <p><strong>Joseph Lieberman</strong></p> <p>This Connecticut senator - a career-long Democrat who split with the party in 2006 over the Iraq war - was spoken of with some seriousness as a possible McCain running mate. Lieberman and McCain enjoy a friendly personal relationship and the two have travelled together extensively. </p> <p>He is well used to the rigours of a vice-presidential campaign, having run alongside Democrat Al Gore in 2000 and come within a hair's breadth of the White House. </p> <p>But he brought several major drawbacks. For one, many Republicans simply would not have trusted or been enthusiastic about having a former Democrat on the ticket. An independent senator, Lieberman votes with the Democrats on most issues and has amassed a moderate voting record. Also, he is a supporter of abortion rights, and is an orthodox Jew, both sure to have troubled socially conservative voters. It was also unlikely that Lieberman could have delivered his home state for the Republicans. </p> <p><strong>Eric Cantor</strong></p> <p>This young Virginia congressman took part in early August in a conference call with reporters to attack Barack Obama's energy plan, leading to speculation that he was auditioning to be McCain's running mate.</p> <p><strong>Tom Ridge</strong></p> <p>The former Pennsylvania governor and the first secretary of homeland security under George Bush was able to claim national security credentials. But as a supporter of abortion rights, conservative leaders warned that Ridge having on the ticket could have been disastrous for McCain's chances, as anti-abortion Republicans would have been inclined to stay at home instead of rallying for the candidate.</p>",
  "<p>How effective was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.democrats20082\">Barack Obama's acceptance speech</a>? One way of measuring it is by taking the temperature of the commentariat. Whereas liberal pundits praised Obama for emphasising substance over style, and for directly challenging John McCain, conservatives largely chose to gloss over the address and instead attack Obama himself.</p> <p>\"On the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr's 'I Have a Dream' speech, Barack Obama answered back tonight with a simple, 'I Have a Plan',\" <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/xxfactor/archive/2008/08/28/i-have-a-plan.aspx\">enthused Dahlia Lithwick</a> of the liberal webzine Slate, who called Obama's speech a \"point-by-point refutation of the claim that the man is all empty talk\".</p> <p>By contrast, Ramesh Ponnuru, writing for the conservative National Review, <a href=\"http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MDMxNjFiNDQ4NTNlYTM4MjUyNzc4NjZiOTllN2NmN2E=\">sought to draw a distinction</a> between Obama the performer and Obama the person.</p> <p>\"Everyone knew that Barack Obama can give a good speech, and he did just that tonight. The Obama we heard from was an attractive figure. Too bad he doesn't exist,\" wrote Ponnuru, who then proceeded to criticise him for his ties to the Rev Jeremiah Wright and former radical activist William Ayers, his support for \"taxpayer-funded abortion\" and driving licenses for illegal immigrants, and his votes against military spending.</p> <p>Washington Post conservative columnist <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/28/AR2008082802852.html\">Charles Krauthammer went one better</a>, calling Obama \"the ultimate self-made man, a dazzling mysterious Gatsby\". He didn't mean it in a good way.</p> <p>For all the summer angst among Democrats over their fears that the Republicans were turning Obama's skills against him, last night was a reminder that the candidate's eloquence - though insufficient by itself - brings a level of transcendence to this campaign with few recent historical parallels.</p> <p>John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan were good, but not this good. Bill Clinton, as he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/28/uselections2008.democrats20084\">showed again this week</a>, is unequalled in his ability to explain complex issues in human terms, and Obama could learn a few things from him. But Obama's soaring rhetoric - even if it wasn't on full display last night - comes from a different place, more Martin Luther King than anything so crass as politics.</p> <p>Terence Samuel of the Root, a webzine targeted at African-Americans, was <a href=\"http://www.theroot.com/id/47853\">moved by the historical importance</a> of Obama's nomination, which took place not in some <a href=\"http://www.gop.com/news/NewsRead.aspx?Guid=a86a28d8-1183-46a6-b74f-8a6462ce25a8\">\"Temple of Obama\"</a>, as the Republicans would have it, but in front of a set designed to evoke <a href=\"http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkihaveadream.htm\">King's 1963 speech</a> before the Lincoln Memorial. Samuel wrote: \"There was no escaping the emotional power of watching Obama, a black man with a name that does not flow easily from the American tongue, step forward to stand center stage of history. Tears were not an uncommon sight during the speech.\"</p> <p>Mainstream analysis today is not quite so full-throated, but the consensus seems pretty clear that Obama's speech was, at the very least, a political success. Patrick Healy of the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/29/us/politics/29assess.html?ex=1377748800&amp;en=635c01aa6dfc6221&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink\">wrote</a> that Obama \"unquestionably confronted two of his greatest challenges\", which he defined as fleshing out his rhetoric with specific policy proposals and taking on McCain. In the Washington Post, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/29/AR2008082900104.html?hpid%3Dtopnews&amp;sub=AR\">Dan Balz called the speech</a> \"a forceful challenge to John McCain and the Republicans, and a restatement of the message to change Washington and the nation that propelled him to the nomination.\"</p> <p>New York's tabloids, which rarely pass up an occasion to snark, both played it straight and gave Obama his due, running huge photos of the candidate smiling and waving. \"HIS NIGHT\", proclaimed the <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com\">Daily News</a>, while <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com\">Rupert Murdoch's Post</a> went with an even more evocative \"THE DREAM LIVES\".</p> <p>Conservative commentator Peggy Noonan, showing her background as a long-time Republican speechwriter, couldn't help but admire Obama's craftsmanship, <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121998875327382805.html?mod=todays_columnists\">writing in the Wall Street Journal</a> (Murdoch again, don't you know): \"The speech itself lacked lift but had heft. It wasn't precisely long on hope, but I think it showed audacity.\" Noonan, though, also called the speech a \"gamble\" because of Obama's \"stern\" and \"indignant\" tone.</p> <p>Noonan may be on to something. For long stretches, Obama was uncharacteristically harsh and negative. His partisans surely enjoyed the red meat he tossed to the crowd. But, historically, the electorate is more likely to reward sunny optimism. That, after all, was the secret to Reagan's success.</p> <p>Still, the \"gamble\" to which Noonan refers may not be all that much of a risk. According to <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/right.htm\">the latest CNN/Opinion Research poll</a>, 69% of those surveyed believe things in the country are going \"pretty badly\" or \"very badly\". Reagan was always able to put a shine on numbers like that, but he was unique. McCain's 2008 persona is dour bordering on nasty, and his <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1836909,00.html\">weirdly hostile interview with Time magazine</a> shows he's not exactly putting a premium on being charming with the press. Perhaps his decade-long <a href=\"http://www.bostonphoenix.com/archive/features/00/02/17/DON_T_QUOTE_ME.html\">honeymoon with the media</a> is finally coming to an end.</p> <p>\"Obama proved tonight - again - that he's one of the few most gifted public communicators of the last generation,\" <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/08/obamas_speech_heavy_in_specifi.php\">wrote Greg Sargent</a> for TPM Election Central. \"But this time, he proved it by not excelling in soaring rhetoric or delivering a speech that will be remembered for the ages. Rather, he recognised that tonight's speech didn't have to be an effort to join the Rhetorical Hall of Fame.\"</p> <p>My guess is that the public will reward Obama with some of his best numbers since last winter. The Gallup daily tracking poll had him<a href=\"http://medianation.blogspot.com/2008/08/moving-on-up.html\"> moving up smartly </a>after just the first two days of the convention. The reaction to his acceptance speech won't be reflected in the results until this weekend.</p> <p>The big question now is whether McCain can have a successful enough week that we're all even again by the time the two conventions are over. Maybe he can. But based on the media reaction, and what we all saw and heard, Obama set a very high standard for McCain to match.</p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson was forced to distance himself from a fellow London Conservative politician who accused British athletes of being \"tainted\" with the blood of Tibetans and \"leaving their consciences at passport control\" when they attended the Olympic Games in Beijing. </p> <p>The Tory mayor's office branded the comments made by Brian Coleman, Conservative assembly member for Barnet and Camden, as \"preposterous\" and \"offensive\". </p> <p>Less than a week after Johnson praised British athletes' performance at the Games and sought to rally enthusiasm for the 2012 London Games, Coleman issued a scathing attack on British Olympians' achievements. </p> <p>In a column for the Barnet and Whetstone Press, Coleman said: \"While Britain's athletes may have won more medals than usual, they must remember that they are tainted with the blood of Tibetans, Falun Gong practitioners, and Roman Catholic priests.\" <br> He went on: \"If you are looking for young heroes and role models, forget the highly paid athletes who leave their consciences at passport control and consider the sacrifice being made by our soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq.\"</p> <p>Coleman, a former deputy chair of the London assembly, also claimed in the article that the Tory London mayor had been \"forced\" to attend the games. </p> <p>\"Boris was forced to go to Beijing to collect the Olympic flag,\" Coleman wrote. \"I would have told the International Olympic Committee to put it in the post.\"</p> <p>A spokesperson for Johnson's office issued a statement rebutting Coleman's claims.</p> <p>\"Brian Coleman is entitled to his views on the Olympics, which is a matter of taste and political opinion, but it is preposterous to suggest that Boris Johnson was forced to go to Beijing. He did so with great enthusiasm and is extremely grateful to his hosts. It was a very proud moment to receive the Olympic flag on behalf of London for the 2012 Games. </p> <p>\"He rejects absolutely any suggestion that Britain's athletes are 'tainted with the blood of Tibetans, Falun Gong practitioners and Roman Catholic priests'. It is offensive to suggest so when these fine young men and women are not only doing Britain proud but are helping to open China to the world and the world to China.\"</p> <p>Labour assembly member Valerie Shawcross described the rant as an outrageous direct attack on Britain's athletes. </p> <p>She said: \"The mayor's support for our athletes as they return from Beijing has been totally undermined by one of his senior appointments.

  "<p>Internet users with Wi-Fi could be paying for other people's web surfing and exposing themselves to fraud, a report claimed today.</p> <p>Research from moneysupermarket.com revealed more than 3.5m adults, or 1 in 9, admit to \"piggybacking\" other people's wireless broadband without permission.</p> <p>Of those who admit to piggybacking, nearly half (46%) said they check emails and do some browsing, while an unrelenting 12% hijack someone else's wireless connection everyday, regularly downloading films and music.</p> <p>It is thought that remote users piggybacking on someone else's internet service may inadvertently gain access to the bill payer's personal bank account or log-in information, making them vulnerable to identity theft and other fraud.</p> <p>The survey results also show that people are doing little to protect themselves from piggybacking, with one in six (17%) failing to put a password on their connection.</p> <p>Other defences include the use of security software such as a WPA encryption device instead of a WPE encryption device, said Moneysupermarket.com. (See below) </p> <p>Around 37% of broadband deals from the top six providers have caps on the amount of downloads available, which means piggybacking users can push you into exceeding your limit.</p> <p>Moneysupermarket.com spokesman James Parker said: \"If people aren't careful they could unwittingly find a huge bill landing on their doorstep for going over the download cap imposed by their provider.</p> <p>\"As the range of these Wi-Fi signals increase, people need to be aware just how important protection is and the best way to do it. </p> <p>\"People are learning to be safe online, but those using wireless can undo all that by leaving their network unprotected. An unsecured internet connection is just the same as leaving your front door open.\"</p> <p>He added: \"One in nine people using another person's Wi-Fi is a staggering amount, you wouldn't expect that many people to go into a neighbour's house and use their shower.</p> <p>\"This is a worrying trend and shows some people have no conscience when sitting in front of their monitor behind closed doors.\"</p> <p>Broadband provider British Telecom said it hadn't yet received any customer complaints over bills or spurious downloads.</p> <p>However, spokesman John Carter said all of its Wi-Fi packages come armed with default WPA security, which automatically shuts out illegitimate users.</p> <p>The utopian dream of free broadband coverage for all is still some way off, but BT is one of several providers intent on creating thousands of new Wi-Fi hotspots up and down the country in locations like hotels, airports and cafes.</p> <h2>Top tips to beat broadband pirates</h2> <p>1. Password protect your wireless internet connection with non-dictionary words and numbers</p> <p>2. Check that your router uses WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) rather than WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) encryption. WPA is a security specification that is more difficult to crack.</p> <p>3. Know your download limit and what that translates to (eg five albums or one film etc)</p> <p>4. Make sure you have appropriate security software and a firewall</p> <p>5. If you have children, consider using parental controls as well as password protection for the router</p> <p><em>Source: moneysupermarket.com</em></p>",

  "<p>Radovan Karadzic today accused the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague of being a \"Nato court\" that intended to \"liquidate\" him and refused to enter pleas on the 11 charges against him.</p> <p>The Bosnian Serb genocide suspect - who was arrested last month in the Serbian capital after 13 years as Europe's most wanted war crimes fugitive - challenged the legitimacy of the court, and, as expected, refused to enter pleas on any of the 11 counts of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes he is charged with.</p> <p>He insisted again at today's pre-trial hearing that he would defend himself in the case. </p> <p>Judge Iain Bonomy of Scotland, who previously presided over the trial of the late Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, entered pleas of not guilty on Karadzic's behalf.</p> <p>Karadzic was ordered to stand to enter a plea by Judge Bonomy who said: \"Count one, you are charged with genocide.\"</p> <p>\"I will not plead in line with my standpoint on this court,\" said the accused.</p> <p>When the judge ordered a plea of not guilty to be entered, Karadzic interrupted him. \"May I hold you to your word?\" he asked.</p> <p>\"What word?\"</p> <p>\"That I'm not guilty.\"</p> <p>\"We'll see in due course,\" said the judge, who was again interrupted by the former warlord when he sought to adjourn the hearing after 22 minutes.</p> <p>Karadzic's attitude indicated he will try to turn the tribunal into a stage for performing the role of an innocent victim of western assassination plots, broken promises and treachery.</p> <p>Since first appearing at the tribunal at the beginning of the month, he has already delivered 10 submissions complaining about his treatment, the translation of documents, his alleged fears for his life and how former US officials from the Clinton years allegedly want him dead.</p> <p>The 63-year-old was the political leader of the Bosnian Serbs during the 1992-95 Bosnia war. He headed the main Serbian party in Bosnia and was president of the self-proclaimed Serbian republic in half of Bosnia.</p> <p>He was indicted for genocide and crimes against humanity in 1995 because of his command role in the Serbian slaughter of almost 8,000 Muslims at Srebrenica in July 1995, the long siege of Sarajevo, and the genocide in north-western Bosnia in the autumn of 1992, when tens of thousands were killed and hundreds of thousands of non-Serbs uprooted and driven from their homes.</p> <p>Karadzic retired from politics a year after the war ended and vanished until he was arrested on a bus in Belgrade in Serbia last month, disguised as a long-haired alternative medicine aficionado under the alias Dragan Dabic.</p> <p>\"I have stopped using a false name. I think all parties should do the same,\" he told Judge Bonomy today, claiming that the tribunal was operating under false pretences.</p> <p>\"I am deeply convinced this is a Nato court,\" he said. \"It's a court of Nato whose aim is to liquidate me.\"</p> <p>While Judge Bonomy was brisk with the accused, he also voiced exasperation with the US lawyers leading the prosecution in what is the most important case to come before the tribunal in its 15-year history.</p> <p>The prosecution is in the process of revising the charge sheet, which was last amended in 2000 to take account of case law and evidence at the tribunal in the past eight years and also to streamline the case against Karadzic.</p> <p>The prosecutors said they hoped to deliver the amended indictment by the end of September. Judge Bonomy was visibly annoyed, asking why the prosecution had waited eight years until the suspect was in custody before starting to revise the charge sheet.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/28/israelandthepalestinians.middleeast\">Israeli ambassador's article</a> yesterday was astonishing in its disregard for the facts. To argue that Israel is not to blame for the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza is an incredible attempt to rewrite history. Israel largely controls the purse strings of the Palestinian Authority, it controls goods and services into and out of the occupied Palestinian territories, and it controls all borders. This was enshrined in the Paris Protocols and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords\">Oslo Accords</a>. The PA was supposed to be the first step towards an independent state. The cruel truth is that it is more akin to a ship in a stormy sea with no engine or navigation tools.</p> <p>These facts go a long way in explaining why the Palestinian economy has collapsed resulting in widespread poverty, unemployment and social deprivation. The Palestinian Authority is a terminally ill patient kept alive only through the life support machine of international aid, which can be turned off at any point. The sanctions after Hamas was elected in January 2006 merely accelerated these problems.</p> <p>The civil war between Hamas and Fatah developed in this context. The Hamas coup in June last year was the dramatic climax. Despite accusations of foul play by both parties, those who held Palestine's purse strings - Israel, the donors and the international financial institutions - swiftly took sides and lifted the international boycott on the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, but tightened sanctions against the Hamas-led government in Gaza.</p> <p>But the policy of isolating Hamas and sanctioning Gaza has backfired. Violence is rising and economic conditions are ruinous, all of which are generating anger and despair. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has deepened and has helped to tighten Hamas's grip. The Ambassador argues that Israel allows humanitarian assistance into Gaza. But international aid cannot replace control over one's economy.</p> <p>The PA has been praised as an example of a moderate government that could potentially deliver security, development and sovereignty to the Palestinian people. But the credibility of President Mahmoud Abbas and other pragmatists is damaged by Israel's actions. In June, the PA had to delay salary payments because Israel deducted $70 million from its clearance revenues. This was in retaliation for Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad's letter to the EU urging them not to upgrade their relations with Israel. </p> <p>This surely shows that Israel should not be controlling Palestinian revenues. Last month, Israel announced it was building more settlements in the West Bank. This move contravenes international law and Israel's obligations under every peace plan since the Oslo Accords. The announcement was even condemned by the US Secretary of State, Condoleeza Rice. And the number of checkpoints, roadblocks and restrictions on movement has increased in the West Bank, according to UN reports.</p> <p>The current focus on Gaza is because we are witnessing a man-made humanitarian crisis. But while the eyes of the world are on Gaza, there is a tightening of Israel's occupation in the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) through the creation of a \"matrix of control\" which to all intents and purposes looks like a colonisation of Palestinian lands. President Bush was right when he <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article3168462.ece\">described</a> the West Bank as \"Swiss cheese\" (full of Israeli holes).</p> <p>The potential for a two-state solution is being destroyed because the basis for a viable Palestinian state is rapidly being undermined. With all focus on the failings of Hamas, Israeli settlement activity and the construction of the '\"separation barrier\" have continued unabated. The Quartet has failed to put pressure on Israel to abide by its obligations under international law and the peace agreements. The reference to Iran as the mysterious secretive puppet master pulling strings from Tehran is a red herring. The only puppet master I see from where I am standing is Israel.</p> <p><em>Mandy Turner has just returned from the West Bank.</em></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Wednesday September 3 2008. Hamas was elected in January 2006, not in 2004, as suggested in the article above. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Black armbands are no doubt being stitched in anticipation of the next two grands prix on the formula one calendar. Phil Hill, who died yesterday at the age of 81, won just three races in his title-winning formula one career - one at Spa-Francorchamps and two at Monza. Those are the circuits formula one visits next, and they herald an emotional week, not only for the Ferrari team and its tifosi, but also for fans of grand prix racing in the 1960s. Hill's death leaves us with just three surviving champions from the sport's two opening decades. Of the 11 men who won the drivers' world championship between 1950 and 1969 only Jack Brabham, John Surtees and Jackie Stewart still live. </p> <p>The death of racing heroes from what is, for some, the golden age of racing is often met with true sadness. Neither myself nor my boyfriend were alive when Hill won his 1961 drivers' crown and yet there was a solemn air to the house this morning as we digested why the natural passing of racing driver from so long ago means so much. And it is simply because he raced in an era when drivers risked their lives every time they climbed into a car - especially at circuits like Monza and Spa, which in '61 was an eight mile epic incorporating dangerous stretches of country road. Not only does one feel in awe of the men who tackled them, but also of those who survived.</p> <p>Who cares about accusations of rose tinted specs - there was a soul to formula one that no longer surrounds it. It might be unfair, but let's pick on some words recently uttered by a driver who had suffered a \"traumatic weekend\" through the 'flu and neck spasms ahead of the Valencia grand prix. At the time, I thought the choice of word insensitive to the families and friends of those who died in the Madrid plane crash days earlier. Now I think of it again, and accept that - through no personal fault of today's racers, but simply the way the sport has changed - there will never be a modern grand prix hero to match those of the past. It is not because they display less courage (that would be to decry the improvements to safety) but because they appear to lack a humbleness and awareness of the world outside their bubble.</p> <p>The corporate gloss that now coats formula one might be one of the reasons for its lack of popularity in North America, a heartland of motor racing. Hill remains the only American-born winner of the world title, and there isn't another one in sight. US racing has, with the merger this year of IRL and ChampCar, patched up its cracks. It doesn't want to be part of the formula one gang - it's having too much fun on its own. Scott Speed, the last American to race in formula one, is now throwing trucks around ovals. The man who today sits in his Toro Rosso seat, four-times ChampCar winner and Frenchman Sebastian Bourdais, has finished in the top 10 just twice this season and is being thrashed by his skinny German team-mate. Although F1 fans will know that in a bizarre way this represents an achievement, it will not be much of an advertisement to the racers he left behind in America. We may wait years before we find a successor to Hill - and, if we ever do, he is unlikely to match up to him.</p> <p>The teams have headed to Monza for testing ahead of the back-to-back Belgian and Italian grands prix, with Massa setting the fastest time on the first day and Nick Heidfeld on the second. Massa is looking ever more likely to be Lewis Hamilton's only challenger for the drivers' title and <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/29/formulaone.motorsports\"> Ferrari have said as much themselves</a> by preparing to subject reigning champ Kimi Raikkonen to the ignominy of being relegated to a supporting role. The best story of the week to be found in the motorsport press, however, was Mark Webber's rant about the poor form of his Red Bull team at the Valencia race. <a href=\" http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/70073\"> Speaking to Autosport's website</a>, he managed to spew out an absurd string of metaphors and clich\u00e9s in an unsubtle attempt to motivate the team. </p> <h2>Last weekend's action</h2> <p>The result of the GP2 races at Valencia was met with mirth by a member of the theguardian.com sports desk, who wanted to know how not one but two cars ran out of fuel in the first race. And not just any cars, but those of the title contenders Giorgio Pantano and Bruno Senna. I tried to explain how visiting a new street circuit led to the law of averages declaring lots of fuel-saving running behind the safety car and hence a strategy of not filling the tank up too much. Of course, the crashes didn't quite happen and race and championship leader Pantano missed out on crucial points - although thankfully for him, rival Senna suffered a similar fate - and gifted the win to startled Russian Vitaly Petrov. Sometimes the strategists are too clever for their own good.</p> <h2>This weekend's action</h2> <p>The big three touring car championships - WTCC, DTM and BTCC - are all out in action, but only one could see the title decided. Fabrizio Giovanardi's lead over BTCC rival Jason Plato is so great that he only needs a strong weekend at Silverstone, coupled with more engine mishap for Plato, to seal the crown. It won't be as exciting as last year's battle - when the pair went into the last of 30 races separated by just a single point - but it will give Giovanardi an incredible eighth overall touring car title.</p>",

  "<p>As a rule, the American press loved <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.barackobama2\">Barack Obama's address</a> to the Democratic national convention on Thursday night. On MSNBC, popular host Keith Olbermann kicked off the post speech conversation by opining: \"We can take pride that this nation can produce men and speakers such as that.\" He likened the speech to the lame Rob Reiner-Aaron Sorkin flick <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112346/\">The American President</a> but said the \"cut the crap moment[s]\" from the Obama speech were \"not the stuff of fiction.\"</p> <p>Olbermann then said that he would \"love to find something to criticise\" about the speech and asked colleague Chris Matthews, \"Got anything?\" \"No,\" said Matthews, before piling on praise of his own. For the next 20 minutes at least, the cable network's coverage played like a vicious parody of soppy-headed liberal boosterism. One guest interviewed by Matthews, an African American pundette, said she'd had to go have herself a good cry before she was ready to appear on air.</p> <p>Why were they were so <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.democrats20081\">turned on by Obama's oration</a>? Because he put forward a liberalism that was patriotic yet pluralistic, tough yet compassionate, confrontational yet thoughtful, full yet empty. It was made-for-cable catnip.</p> <p>Obama looked at the last four years and yelled \"Enough!\" He promised to end the war in Iraq but to do so \"responsibly.\" He promised new taxes for increases in the government provision of education and healthcare while at the same time ensuring that a nebulous \"95 percent of working families\" would pay no more in tax, and that many would pay less.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/08/28/obama-accepts-nomination-calls-on-voters-to-revive-american-promise/\">newly-minted Democratic nominee</a> relented from his former opposition to offshore oil exploration and drilling but said that this was only a \"stop gap measure\" to supplement his otherwise green energy policies. On two hot button domestic policies, he said that he thought pro-lifers and pro-choicers could agree on policies to \"reduce unwanted pregnancies\" and he badly caricatured the gun debate like so: \"Don't tell me we can't uphold the second amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals.\"</p> <p>He both defended and attacked John McCain. Obama thanked the former prisoner of war for his service to country but insisted that he is a Washington insider who is out of touch on several fronts. He said that the wealthy Republican does not know what it's like out there for suffering workers. And in the best if not entirely accurate line of the night, Obama said McCain \"stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end the Iraq war.\"</p> <p>It was not a bad speech by the low standards of modern American rhetoric, so maybe we should cut some slack to those media figures who got caught up in the spectacle. After all, it did take place not in a convention hall but in the packed-to-capacity Invesco Field in Denver. The crowd was waving American flags and \"change\" signs and chanting \"Yes we can!\" There was a fireworks display and confetti with enough red, white, and blue streamers that it looked like the stage had been silly stringed.</p> <p>But what's Obama's excuse for slacking off? This address was not nearly as good as his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWynt87PaJ0\">keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic convention</a>. His lines this time ran from serviceable to pretty awful. A supposed hard truth that he told to Democrats was \"We can not meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.\" It sounded like something Al Gore would have said, circa 1995.</p> <p>Or how about this one: \"If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next commander-in-chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.\" Not, \"McCain's judgment is deficient.\" Not, \"His temperament is dangerous and will lead us over a cliff.\" Rather, Obama prissily informed us that he's \"ready to have\" that debate about all this. With all due respect, no he's not.</p>",
  "<p><strong>12.55pm</strong> Those of us who thought this game would be over within an hour this morning, and that includes myself, have been thoroughly confounded, writes <em>Richard Rae at Basingstoke</em>. Resuming on 108 for five, still 132 short of victory on the sort of wicket the Durham attack would love to roll up and carry around with them, Sean Ervine and Liam Dawson played admirably in taking the score on to 171 before Dawson scampered down the track and managed to flick a Paul Wiseman delivery into the hands of Dale Benkenstein at leg gully.</p> <p>As well as being the highest partnership of the match, it was also a record sixth-wicket partnership for Hampshire against Durham, and it's put Hampshire within distance of a win that might keep them up, and deprive Durham of the championship title. Ervine, who has been joined by Dimi Mascarenhas, is playing a really fine knock; playing and missing from time to time, because the wicket is still doing plenty, but picking runs up off his legs in going to his season's best. Hampshire beat Durham by four runs up at Chester-le-Street - are they about to do the double? Hampshire are now 192 for five, need another 48 to win and Mascarenhas has just been dropped by Callum Thorp off Wiseman.</p> <p><strong>1.03pm</strong> There was a general impatience around North Marine Road for Yorkshire to get on with it this morning and put Kent back into bat - but it did not extend to Darren Gough, writes <em>David Hopps at Scarborough</em>. Yorkshire's captain chose to bat on in ideal bowling conditions and the first hour passed with Yorkshire extending their overnight 409 for seven to 455, a considerable lead of 230. It looked as if Gough's tactics might have been mistaken when heavy cloud cover began to clear and promised to give Kent easier batting conditions, but in defiance of the forecast the blue skies soon disappeared, leaving Kent to begin what seemed to be futile resistance. Matthew Hoggard whipped out Rob Key cheaply at first slip to leave them 37 for one at lunch. Since losing his England place, Hoggard's quirky humour has not exactly been lavished on the Yorkshire media corps, with whom he communicates largely in unintelligible grunts.</p> <p>The Scarborough press box was a demoralised place this morning after a Yorkshire press quiz team's 38-29 defeat to a Yorkshire cricket trio in a quiz on behalf of the Dickie Bird Foundation, which raises money for sports opportunities for underprivileged kids. \"They got questions about which cricketer Jemima Khan was married to and we got how many feathers in a shuttlecock,\" was one complaint from the man from the Yorkshire Post.</p> <p>If the desperately misguided collapse of county cricket coverage in English newspapers - both regional and national - continues it will not be long before Bird has to raise money for underprivileged cricket freelances. County cricket coverage is in crisis. In the past week, the Birmingham Post &amp; Mail and the Independent have made deep cutbacks in their county cricket coverage. Other examples of this are easy to find. If this dismal trend continues, which it will, county cricket will bumble along much as it pleases with minimal journalistic comment but lots of PR guff provided by its own websites. You might retort that you will all get by perfectly OK in the democratic world of the blog where comment is free. But you won't. Without basic knowledge and information, opinions, however trenchantly expressed, are next to useless. Ask Nick Davies.</p> <p><strong>1.13pm</strong> There aren't many more elegant batsmen on the county circuit than Mark Wagh, writes <em>Lawrence Booth at Hove</em>, but then there aren't many who are more infuriating either. When he moved to a half-century this morning on another grey south-coast day, it was the ninth time in 20 innings this season that he has reached fifty - and he is yet to make it to three figures. He may not get a better chance. Wagh is 85 not out at lunch, with Nottinghamshire 359 for three in reply to Sussex's 338. The pitch is low but flat; the attack is Mushy-less; and Sussex lack a spring in their step. Perhaps the emotional farewell to Mushtaq Ahmed over the last couple of days has taken its toll. Whatever the truth, Wagh has the conditions at his mercy, and the former Somerset player Matthew Wood, unbeaten on 35, is keeping him steady company.</p> <p>Wagh is lovely to watch when he is in full flow, especially on the drive, but he has had a tendency in the past to fret unduly over the aesthetics. So it was good to see a touch of pragmatism about his approach this morning as the Sussex spinners Ollie Rayner and Mike Yardy - miraculously getting through 14 overs in the first 45 minutes of play - were milked with ease.</p> <p>The only wicket to fall was that of Ashwell Prince, who is earning a bit of cash after playing a central role in South Africa's Test-series win but was caught at slip by Chris Adams off Rayner for 30 with the score on 288. But that was as good as it got for Sussex and by lunch Notts had added precisely 100 in the 33 overs bowled so far. Whether they can force a result on a sluggish surface is another matter.</p> <p><strong>3.43pm</strong> At around 3pm today James Kirtley, fielding on the deep backward square-leg boundary, put an imaginary gun to his head and pulled the trigger, writes <em>Lawrence Booth at Hove</em>. A little over half an hour later Nottinghamshire have gone into tea on 458 for three and are doing pretty well as they please. Mark Wagh has 127, Matthew Wood 89 and the nature of this wicket is reflected by the fact that four of the five Notts players to have batted so far have made their highest score of the season. The fifth, Ashwell Prince, has had other fish to fry.</p> <p>I'd love to report that Wagh and Wood have battled their way through a testing spell of pressure from the Sussex bowlers, but this has been the stuff of candy and babies. And if Notts, who now lead by 119 with four sessions left, do manage to force a victory that would take them 13 points clear of Somerset at the top of the table (but having played a game more), Sussex may even begin to worry about relegation - if they're not already.</p> <p>Their remaining three matches are against Yorkshire (away, then at home) and Durham at Chester-le-Street, so at least their fate is in their hands, which is all any sporting side can ever ask for. But the negligible contributions of Mushtaq Ahmed this season - as well as the cock-up over the signing of Ryan Harris - have exposed a worrying lack of depth in the champions' attack. When Kirtley fired his make-believe revolver, he may have had in mind his own record: the last time he took a championship wicket was April 2007.</p> <p><strong>4.20pm</strong> Kent trail by 61 runs with eight wickets left at tea in Scarborough - and that spells a largely fruitless afternoon's work for Yorkshire, <em>writes David Hopps</em>. The only wicket they have taken between lunch and tea is Joe Denly, caught at slip for 66 during a purposeful spell by Matthew Hoggard. The Hogster had looked more cumbersome at mid-off in the previous over when Denly mis-drove the leg-spin of Adil Rashid, but he never came to terms with the whereabouts of the ball as it sailed over his shoulder. Neil Dexter is 62 not out at tea.</p> <p>A Scarborough ritual is taking place below me at the moment. The Great Lost Art of Pitch Staring is alive and well here. Scores of spectators have wandered out to the pitch to gaze at it. Often, they do not just do this for a minute or two, then wander off for a cup of tea, but remain for an entire interval until the ringing of the bell orders them to leave. Staring At the Pitch will not automatically strike people as one of the great hobbies of England. It is to be hoped that they get more out of it than Yorkshire have.</p> <p>Darren Gough put in a useful post-lunch spell with no reward. He is retiring at the end of the season and had intended to end his championship career already were it not for the inconvenient fact that Yorkshire tend to win more when he plays than when he doesn't. He will not want to be the captain who takes Yorkshire back into the Second Division, but with Hampshire winning and Kent putting up more redoubtable resistance than many expected, he will still be a little unnerved by the championship table.</p> <p>Yorkshire is surely the only county were the spectators barrack the tannoy announcer if he doesn't provide the county scores at every interval. This happened to Tony, the tannoy announcer at Scarborough, yesterday as he was roundly rebuked by a notoriously angry Yorkshire member, Andrew Bose, a former Hackney councillor. Both are fluent in Latin. \"He is much more polite to me when we talk in Latin,'' said Tony, \"but as far as the cricket is concerned, it's come to the point of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noli_Me_Tangere\">Noli me tangere</a>.\"</p>",

Other famous people to have come from Cleethorpes include the actress Patricia Hodge and the bassist from Saxon, neither of whom have written songs for Michael Jackson.</p> <p>10. The flute on Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' was played by Larry Williams. The \"mama se mama sa\" business in the song was recently sampled by Rihanna (on Don't Stop the Music), although when Michael included those lyrics in his own version he ended up being sued for copyright infringement by Manu Dibango, and settled out of court.</p> <p>11. Invincible cost $30m to make, putting the unit cost of each copy sold at $30m (ok, so it didn't really only sell one copy but it was hardly the big seller some were hoping for, along with the Spice Girls album Forever, which set Rodney Jerkins's career back a bit.)</p> <p>12. When Michael is shopping in France for ingredients to make an omelette, he doesn't stop 'til he gets un oeuf. When he gets the egg home, he beats it. Other things he can cook include rock cakes with you, hummus nature, and she's outta my loaf.</p> <p>13. Michael Jackson often carries an umbrella. He likes to be in the shade.</p> <p>14.

Other singers to be 50 this year include Madonna, Prince, Kate Bush and Ice-T. If one were to put them in order of who had grown old the most gracefully, Michael would be one place below Madonna.</p> <p>22. Artists to have sung Michael's songs include Ian Brown (Billie Jean), Blackstreet (Billie Jean) and the Flying Pickets (Billie Jean). </p> <p>23.

Jacko once phoned Adam Ant to ask him where he got his jacket from, but Adam Ant thought it was one of his mates taking the piss and hung up. Hung Up was a 2006 hit for Madonna. Coincidence?</p> <p>28. Michael's hair caught fire once.</p> <p>29. Michael's middle name is Joseph.</p> <p>30. Michael's dad's name is Joseph.</p> <p>31. Joseph was sometimes a bit mean to his kids. On one occasion he donned murderin' burglar \"attire\" and broke into Michael's bedroom while Michael was asleep, to teach him a Very Important Lesson about not leaving the window open. Joseph Jackson did not hold any truck with the concept of \"it being a bit stuffy\".</p> <p>32. Sometimes Michael cries.</p> <p>33. The old child abuse business kicked off on the weekend of the Reading festival. Headlining act New Order changed the lyrics of True Faith to \"when I was a very small boy, Michael Jackson played with me\". For the avoidance of doubt we should point out that Michael Jackson never sexually abused mild-mannered New Order frontman Bernard Sumner.</p> <p>34. Thriller has sold in excess of 12 copies. In fact, Wikipedia reckons it's sold between 47\u2013108m copies worldwide, which proves that you can't trust Wikipedia when it comes to counting. </p> <p>35.

You can say what you like about Michael Jackson but if, tomorrow, he announced that he'd be at the O2 Arena performing Thriller in its entirety with a hundred dancers and a big smoke machine you'd be there like a shot.</p> <p>48. EXCLUSIVE FACT!!! The Streets' Mike Skinner's favourite thing about Michael Jackson is: \"There was this session bassist who did a show at Edinburgh, just talking about his life and experiences, and he told a story about how he was booked to play some stuff on a Michael Jackson album. Michael wasn't in the studio, but between takes the producer would look to one side in the control before saying yes or no \u2026 It turned out he was taking his cues from Michael Jackson, who was hiding under the mixing desk.\" Bonus fact: Mike Skinner cannot believe that Michael Jackson is 50.</p> <p>49. Back to Jacko's kitchen. Other things you'll find there include rockin robin, some off the Wall's ice cream, wanna be apple tartin' somethin', and the girl is mince.

  "<p>Opposition to Russia's recognition of the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia has been almost universal, even among its friends and allies. The G7 nations have accused Moscow of breaking international law. The EU is considering sanctions. And, most significantly, China has failed to endorse Russia's actions.</p> <h2>What are the Chinese saying and why?</h2> <p>At the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tajikistan, which brought together Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, a final statement gave the Kremlin little comfort: \"We express grave concern in connection with the recent tensions around the South Ossetian issue and urge the sides to solve existing problems peacefully, through dialogue, and to make efforts facilitating reconciliation and talks.\"</p> <p>Analysts say China wants to avoid any anti-western gestures and, with its own restive ethnic minorities, showing any support for separatism.</p> <h2>How has Russia reacted to the criticism?</h2> <p>Defiantly. The prime minister, Vladimir Putin, went on CNN to accuse the US of provoking the conflict by arming the Georgian army, and suggested that this was part of an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/russia.georgia\">election ploy</a> to help the Republican presidential candidate, John McCain, in his campaign for the White House. \"Russia does not feel isolated and is not afraid to be isolated,\" said the Russian ambassador in Brussels.</p> <h2>What could happen next?</h2> <p>The first significant development will be at the emergency summit of the EU on Monday, when discussion of sanctions will be on the table. These could include a visa ban on officials from the breakaway regions, a ban on Russian property investment in Europe or the postponement of new partnership accord talks between Moscow and the EU, which are scheduled for September 15. </p> <h2>Will the EU go that far?</h2> <p>While some of the former Soviet countries have pushed for a firm response, others such as Germany, Italy and France \u2013 which brokered the peace plan \u2013 want to keep lines of communication open and constructive. There will be more condemnation of Russia's \"illegitimate\" action and moves to provide humanitarian aid to Georgia. </p> <h2>What of the speech by the British foreign secretary, David Miliband, in Ukraine about building a \"coalition against Russian aggression\"?</h2> <p>It has not been well received, particularly because many Ukrainians have no wish to join Nato. They do want to join the EU, which has yet to give a pledge of future membership. The Financial Times commented in an <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f4a72d5e-752e-11dd-ab30-0000779fd18c.html\">editorial</a> today: \"Brussels must now summon up the courage to offer a positive response.\"</p>",
  "<p>Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, it has seemed that new rules were being established for the conduct of international relations in central and eastern Europe and central Asia. The watchwords were independence and interdependence; sovereignty and mutual responsibility; cooperation and common interests. They are good words that need to be defended. </p> <p>The Georgia crisis provided <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/29/russia.georgia\">a rude awakening</a>. The sight of Russian tanks in a neighbouring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the Prague Spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain. The old sores and divisions fester. Russia remains unreconciled to the new map of Europe. </p> <p>Yesterday's unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks not just the end of the post-cold war period, but is also the moment when countries are required to set out where they stand on the significant issues of nationhood and international law. </p> <p>The Russian president says he is not afraid of a <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4622422.ece\">new cold war</a>. We don't want one. He has a big responsibility not to start one. </p> <p><a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7585527.stm\">Ukraine</a> is a leading example of the benefits that accrue when a country takes charge of its own destiny, and seeks alliances with other countries. </p> <p>Its choices should not be seen as a threat to Russia or an act of hostility. Equally its independence does demand a new relationship with Russia \u2013 a partnership of equals, not the relationship of master and servant. </p> <p>Russia must not learn the wrong lessons from the Georgia crisis: there can be no going back on fundamental principles of territorial integrity, democratic governance and international law. It has shown in the last two weeks what anyone could have foretold: that it can defeat Georgia's army. But today Russia is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/28/russia.nato\">more isolated</a>, less trusted and less respected than two weeks ago. It has made military gains in the short term. But over time it will feel the economic and political losses. If Russia truly wants respect and influence, and the benefits that flow from it, Russia needs to change course. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/russia.georgia\"> Prime Minister Putin</a> has described the collapse of the Soviet Union as \"the greatest geopolitical catastrophe\" of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4480745.stm\">the 20th century</a>. I don't see it that way. Most people of the former Soviet bloc or Warsaw Pact don't see it that way. It will be a tragedy for Russia if it spends the next 20 years believing it to be the case. </p> <p>Indeed, since 1991 there has been no \"stab in the back\" of Russia. In fact, we have offered Russia extensive cooperation with the EU and Nato; membership of the council of Europe and the G8. Summits, mechanisms and meetings have been developed by the EU and Nato not to humiliate or threaten Russia, but to engage with it. The EU and the United States provided critical support for the Russian economy when it was needed, and western companies have invested heavily. And Russia has made substantial gains from its reintegration into the global economy. </p> <p>These are actions that seek to promote prosperity and respect for Russia. But they have recently been met with scorn. Indeed, the record from suspension of Russian participation in the conventional armed forces to harassment of business people and cyber attacks on neighbours is not a good one. Now we have Georgia. </p> <p>People often talk and ask about unity in Europe. Russian action has produced unity in Europe. Unity in demanding the withdrawal of Russian troops to their August 7 positions; unity in rejecting the use of force as the basis for redrawing the map of the Caucasus; unity in support of the democratically elected government of Georgia. </p> <p>Of course Russia can and should have interests in its neighbours, but like everyone else, it must earn that influence. Indeed, they do not make up the \"post-Soviet space\" to which Prime Minister Putin often refers. The collapse of the Soviet Union created a new reality \u2013 sovereign, independent countries with minds of their own and rights to defend. </p> <p>Russia also needs to clarify its attitude to the use of force to solve disputes. Some argue that Russia has done nothing not previously done by Nato in Kosovo in 1999. But this comparison does not bear serious examination. </p> <p>Leave to one side that Russia spends a lot of time arguing in the UN and elsewhere against \"interference\" in internal affairs, whether in Zimbabwe or Burma. Nato's actions in Kosovo followed dramatic and systematic abuse of human rights, culminating in ethnic cleansing on a scale not seen in Europe since the second world war. Nato acted over Kosovo only after intensive negotiations in the UN security council and determined efforts at peace talks. Special envoys were sent to warn Milosevic in person of the consequences of his actions. None of this can be said for Russia's use of force in Georgia. </p> <p>The decision to recognise Kosovo's independence came only after Russia made clear it would veto the deal proposed by the UN secretary general's special envoy, former Finnish President Ahtisaari. Even then we agreed to a further four months of negotiations by an EU-US-Russia troika in order to ensure that no stone was left unturned in the search for a mutually acceptable compromise. </p> <p>Over Georgia, Russia moved from support for territorial integrity to breaking up the country in three weeks and relied entirely on military force to do so. </p> <p>Russia must now ask itself about the relationship between short-term military victories and long-term economic prosperity. At the time of the Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary in 1956 or Czechoslovakia in 1968, no one asked what impact its actions had on the Russian stock market. There was no Russian stock market. </p> <p>Now, the conflict in Georgia has been associated with a sharp decline in investor confidence. Russia's foreign exchange reserves fell in one week by $16bn. In one day the value of Gazprom fell by the same amount. Risk premia in Russia have sky-rocketed. </p> <p>Isolation of Russia is not feasible. It would be counter-productive because Russia's economic integration is the best discipline on its politics. It would only strengthen the sense of victimhood that fuels intolerant nationalism. And it would compromise the world's interests in tackling nuclear proliferation, addressing climate change or stabilising Afghanistan. </p> <p>But the international community is not impotent. Europeans need Russian gas, but Gazprom needs European consumers and investment. The reality of interdependence is that both sides have leverage; both sides can change the terms of trade. </p> <p>Our approach must be hard-headed-engagement. That means bolstering allies, rebalancing the energy relationship with Russia, defending the rules of international institutions, and renewing efforts to tackle \"unresolved conflicts\". </p> <p>Here, Ukraine is key. It has strong links to Russia and this is firmly in both countries' interests. But Ukraine is also a European country. Ukrainian leaders have spoken of their aspiration to see their country become a member of the EU. Article 49 of the EU treaty gives all European countries the right to apply. The prospect and reality of EU membership has been a force for stability, prosperity and democracy across eastern Europe and it should remain so beyond. Once Ukraine fulfils EU criteria, it should be accepted as a full member. </p> <p>As for Ukraine's <a href=\"http://www.independent.ie/opinion/letters/ukraines-nato-bid-may-backfire-1465334.html\">relationship with Nato</a>, it does not pose a threat to Russia. It is about strengthening Ukraine's democratic institutions and independence \u2013 things that will benefit Russia in the long term. </p> <p>Europe also must re-balance the energy relationship with Russia. Europe needs to invest in storing gas to deal with interruptions. More interconnections between countries and properly functioning internal markets will increase resilience. It needs diverse, secure and resilient gas supplies. </p> <p>Europe needs to act as one when dealing with third parties like Russia. And we will be reducing our dependence on gas altogether: increasing energy efficiency, investing in carbon capture and storage technology for coal, and in renewables and nuclear power. </p> <p>In all international institutions, we will need to review our relations with Russia. I do not apologise for rejecting kneejerk calls for Russia to be <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/russia/article/should-russia-be-expelled-from-G8\">expelled from the G8</a>, or for EU-Russia or Nato-Russia relations to be broken. But we do need to examine the nature, depth and breadth of relations with Russia. </p> <p>In Nato, we will stand by our commitments to existing members, and there will be renewed determination that there should be no Russian veto on the future direction of Nato. </p> <p>Fourth, the unresolved conflicts that mark the end of empire should not be ignored. The world's attention is currently on South Ossetia and Abkhazia. But the conflicts in Transnistria and Nagorno-Karabakh must <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/28/georgia.russia \">not be overlooked</a>. Each has its roots in longstanding ethnic tensions, exacerbated by economic and political underdevelopment. </p> <p>The choice today is clear. Not to sponsor a new cold war, but to be clear about the foundations of lasting peace.</p> <p>In cooperation with <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</p>",

But the consensus was that, accepting the Democratic nomination for president, he lived up to all the hype (and there was an awful lot of it). </p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337065388\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1760479111_gdn-int-080829-cb-US-Obama-Speech-4x3.flv\"/> </video>   <p>In fact, searching for a political commentator who dared to criticise Obama's speech was a bit like looking for a needle in a haystack.</p> <p>On micro-blog network Twitter, Marc Ambinder sums up the speech as \"<a href=\"http://twitter.com/marcambinder/statuses/902439937\">Who he [Obama] is. Why McCain is bad. We need to come together</a>.\" </p> <p>Ambinder \u2013 but not Obama \u2013 forgot one key area, which was policy. Before the speech the man accused of championing style over substance was being implored to put flesh on the bones of his candidacy.</p> <p>The New York Times writes that Obama detailed \"concrete steps he would take to address the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/29/us/politics/29dems.html?hp \">anxieties of working-class Americans</a>, promising tax cuts for the middle class and pledging to wean the country from dependence on Middle East oil within 10 years to address high fuel prices\".</p> <p>In The Daily Dish <a href=\"http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/08/the-hope-we-con.html\">Andrew Sullivan opines</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>What he didn't do was give an airy, abstract, dreamy confection of rhetoric. The McCain campaign set Obama up as a celebrity airhead, a Paris Hilton of wealth and elitism. And he let them portray him that way, and let them over-reach, and let them punch him again and again ... and then he turned around and destroyed them. If the Rove Republicans thought they were playing with a patsy, they just got a reality check.</p> </blockquote> <p>For John Judis, on The New Republic, Obama achieved everything necessary: </p> <blockquote> <p>He had to do three things for the fall, which he accomplished in his speech: first, he focused the campaign on the economy - and did so by personalizing the fear and anger that many Americans now feel. Secondly, he answered forcefully arguments about his ability as commander-in-chief. And third, he invoked his own biography to dispel fears that as a president he would favor one group over another.</p> </blockquote> <p>Slate dubbed it his I Have a Plan speech, in deference to Martin Luther King's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbUtL_0vAJk\">I Have a Dream</a> speech, made exactly 45 years ago. </p> <p>But even if many felt that Obama, out of necessity, adopted a more workmanlike tone, that did not stop some writers employing the emotional flourishes that the man himself is associated with.</p> <p><a href=\" http://www.slate.com/id/2198848/\">John Dickerson writes</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>When he finished speaking, I looked at the faces around me. From an older African-American woman to a young father to a middle-aged woman, the tears were either in their eyes or rolling down their cheeks. A couple nearby kissed when the speech was over.</p> </blockquote> <p>While on his Salon blog, <a href=\"http://open.salon.com/content.php?cid=13271\">Dan Conley effuses</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>Barack Obama has always been a soaring orator, but tonight be became both a political warrior and someone Americans can see as their next president.</p> </blockquote> <p>One of the few dissenting voices comes from Charles Babington, of <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/nation/27643279.html\">The Associated Press</a>, who writes: </p> <blockquote> <p>Instead of dwelling on specifics, he laced the crowning speech of his long campaign with the type of rhetorical flourishes that Republicans mock and the attacks on John McCain that Democrats cheer.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Sam Boyd on the American Post, is <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/tapped_archive?month=08&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=great_speech_terrible_ap_cover\">affronted by the temerity of the Associated Press</a>, in criticising Obama: </p> <blockquote> <p>The entire \"analysis\" is completely nonsensical, but seems designed to leave a casual reader with an impression that Obama lacked substance. It admits he provided details, but then ignores its own admission.</p> </blockquote> <p>So, how was it for you?</p>",
  "<p>What do I think of when I think of Pakistan? I see the dusty mosques of Multan, the chaotic illegal markets in Peshawar where you can buy everything from a fake Rolex to an AK-47, the ruins at Taxila, the temple at Katas, the food at Cooco's Den with the Badshahi Mosque providing the backdrop and the Persian couplet on Anarkali's tomb: \"Could I see again the face of my lost friend, I would thank my God until the day of Judgment.\"</p> <p>Most of all, I remember a family. On my first tour in 2004 I often shared a room with Osman Samiuddin, a fine young writer who had yet to decide whether to cover cricket full-time. Two years later, by which time he was editor of Cricinfo in Pakistan, I stayed with his family in Karachi and with his brother-in-law, Murtaza, in Lahore. Apart from our old house in the north of England and my grandmother's place in Kerala, it was the only time that I've ever felt at home.</p> <p>Between playing with Osman's nieces and laughing at some of Murtaza's more risqu\u00e9 jokes, there was no time to feel homesick, even though it was a bitterly cold winter. When I fancied a quieter time, I would stay at home and chat to his father, whose observations about partition and life in India in the 1950s taught me far more than a decade of poorly written textbooks ever had.</p> <p>The decision to postpone the Champions Trophy \u2013 let's be honest and say that the chances of it ever being held in Pakistan now are as remote as BATE Borisov winning the Champions League \u2013 means that I will have to wait a few more months to cross the border again. But this isn't about personal disappointment; it's about how an entire nation has been stereotyped and isolated.</p> <p>When I first heard the news, I wanted to know what Osman thought of the decision. By far the most eloquent voice on matters pertaining to Asian cricket, he didn't disappoint. \"What more could Pakistan have done?\" he asked in his column. \"Nothing. The security arrangements, by many accounts, were outstanding. FICA's [the Federation of International Cricketers' Associations] chief is supposed to have told the PCB [Pakistan Cricket Board] that they were the best arrangements he had seen. The Asia Cup was held recently without so much as a beep on the many metal detectors and scanners placed at stadiums. No, the question is not what Pakistan could have done, for they did everything.\"</p> <p>If you tell a lie enough times, people will believe it to be the gospel. The decision not to play in Pakistan wasn't really about security. Not one Indian player spoke of being under siege during the recent Asia Cup, and these are citizens of a country that has fought four wars with Pakistan and still squabbles over disputed territory in Kashmir. To imagine that a Ricky Ponting or a Hamish Marshall would be a more attractive target than Sachin Tendulkar for some clueless Jihadi is to reduce yourself to the intellectual level of those who envision 72 Ana Ivanovic clones waiting for them in heaven should they strap some RDX to their belts and blow themselves up with a timer.</p> <p>No, the decision to isolate Pakistan has far more to do with it not being \"fun\", with the players' every step shadowed by army commandos and police. It is the sort of place where the PlayStation brigade that lacks the imagination to explore comes down with the mysteriously named (given the opulence of the five-star hotel rooms they stay in) Cabin Fever.</p> <p>Please note that Australia and England are due to play Test matches in Bangalore and Ahmedabad, where there were serial bomb blasts not so long ago. Will they pull out of those games? Will they heck. No player with an interest in his bank account will refuse an Indian tour, leave alone complain about the arrangements. There are compensations too, in the form of multiple endorsement deals, lavish parties thrown by the likes of Vijay Mallya and plenty of attention from Bollywood starlets and models. What's not to like?</p> <p>One of Australia's finest cricket writers was supposed to be in Pakistan to cover the Champions Trophy, and he minced no words when I asked him what he thought of the decision. \"The attitude of the players is shameful,\" he told me. \"When they speak off the record, they're so fucking disrespectful of other countries. Many of them are complete xenophobes.\"</p> <p>That's of little consolation to Pakistanis right now. A mediocre team has yet to recover from the first-round World Cup exit and the death of Bob Woolmer, and the fact that they won't play any Tests in 2008 is a shameful indictment of a Future Tours Programme that seems to cater only to Australia, India, England and South Africa. As Osman wrote: \"Pakistan needed to host the Champions Trophy, the second most important ODI tournament in the game, to put some feelgood back in the air, an opportunity to show that it still matters. Pakistan needed to show itself - and see itself - in headlines that didn't have the words 'terrorist' and 'Al-Qaeda' in them.\"</p> <p>A tri-series has been mooted for South Africa in September with Sri Lanka as the third team, but that will be little consolation to Pakistani fans who were looking forward to the arrival of the world's finest. For them, there is nothing to get excited about now until India arrive in early 2009.</p> <p>It just makes you wonder how different the scenario might have been if Stephen Waugh was captain of Australia. No one did more to get rid of the arrogant and ignorant \"Done-the-poverty-done-the-elephants-time-to-go-home\" mindset that habitually accompanied teams that came to the subcontinent. My Australian friend admitted as much. \"There's been a real regression in players' attitudes in the last few years,\" he said. \"Under Waugh, there was an element of curiosity about foreign countries and cultures. But these young blokes couldn't care less. They're rich, dense and think of nothing other than themselves.\"</p> <p>If you saw those words in isolation, you could easily convince yourself that you were reading about the English football team. Maybe cricket is the new football after all. It is nothing to be proud of.</p>",

  "<h2><a name=\"mccain\">On John McCain</a></h2> <p>Now let there be no doubt. The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect. And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need.</p> <p>But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush 90% of the time. Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than 90% of the time? I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a 10% chance on change.</p> <p>The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on healthcare and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent. He said that our economy has made \"great progress\" under this president. He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong. And when one of his chief advisers - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a \"mental recession,\" and that we've become, and I quote, \"a nation of whiners\".</p> <p>A nation of whiners? Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made. Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty. These are not whiners. They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint. These are the Americans that I know.</p> <p>Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans. I just think he doesn't know. Why else would he define middle class as someone making under $5m a year? How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than 100 million Americans? How else could he offer a healthcare plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatise social security and gamble your retirement?</p> <p>It's not because John McCain doesn't care. It's because John McCain doesn't get it.</p> <p>For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else. In Washington, they call this the ownership society, but what it really means is - you're on your own. Out of work? Tough luck. No healthcare? The market will fix it. Born into poverty? Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots. You're on your own.</p> <p>Well it's time for them to own their failure. It's time for us to change America.</p> <h2><a name=\"foreignpolicy\">On foreign policy</a></h2> <p>If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next commander-in-chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.</p> <p>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face. When John McCain said we could just \"muddle through\" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights. John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the gates of hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.</p> <p>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government, and even the Bush administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79bn surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.</p> <p>That's not the judgment we need. That won't keep America safe. We need a president who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past.</p> <p>You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying Iraq. You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington. You can't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances. If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need.</p> <p>We are the party of Roosevelt. We are the party of Kennedy. So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country. Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe. The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans - Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.</p> <p>As commander-in-chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.</p> <p>I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan. I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts. But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression. I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease. And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future.</p> <h2><a name=\"economy\">On the economy</a></h2> <p>We Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.</p> <p>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma. We measure progress in the 23m new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was president - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.</p> <p>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honours the dignity of work.</p> <p>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.</p> <h2><a name=\"taxes\">On taxes</a></h2> <p>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it.</p> <p>Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.</p> <p>I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.</p> <p>I will cut taxes - cut taxes - for 95% of all working families. Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class.</p> <h2>On fuel</h2> <p>For the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as president: in 10 years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.</p> <p>Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years, and John McCain has been there for 26 of them. In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels. And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office.</p> <p>Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution. Not even close.</p> <p>As president, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power. I'll help our auto companies retool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America. I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars. And I'll invest $150bn over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and 5m new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.</p> <h2><a name=\"education\">On education</a></h2> <p>Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy. Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education. And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance. I'll invest in early childhood education. I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support. And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability. And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.</p> <h2><a name=\"healthcare\">On healthcare</a></h2> <p>Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible healthcare for every single American. If you have healthcare, my plan will lower your premiums. If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves. And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most.</p> <p>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.</p> <h2><a name=\"pensions\">On pensions</a></h2> <p>Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect social security for future generations.</p> <h2><a name=\"abortion\">On abortion</a></h2> <p>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country.</p> <h2>On gun control</h2> <p>The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the second amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals.</p> <h2>On same-sex marriages</h2> <p>I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination.</p> <h2>On immigration</h2> <p>Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers. This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.</p> <h2>On individual responsibility</h2> <p>We must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money. It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F Kennedy called our \"intellectual and moral strength\". Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient. Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair. But we must also admit that programmes alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.</p> <p>Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of America's promise.</p> <h2>On equal pay</h2> <p>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.</p> <h2><a name=\"patriotism\">On patriotism</a></h2> <p>What I will not do is suggest that the senator [McCain] takes his positions for political purposes. Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.</p> <p>The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook. So let us agree that patriotism has no party. I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain. The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag. They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of America.</p> <p>So I've got news for you, John McCain. We all put our country first.</p> <h2><a name=\"background\">On his background</a></h2> <p>In the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbour, marched in Patton's army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.</p> <p>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mum, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.</p> <p>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the south side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.</p> <p>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman. She's the one who taught me about hard work. She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life. She poured everything she had into me. And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well.</p> <p>I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. These are my heroes. Theirs are the stories that shaped me. And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the United States.</p> <h2>On change</h2> <p>I realise that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office. I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington.</p> <p>But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring. What the naysayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me. It's been about you.</p> <p>For 18 long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past. You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result. You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington. Change comes to Washington. Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.</p> <p>America, this is one of those moments.</p> <h2>On the American spirit</h2> <p>This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich. We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong. Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores.</p> <p>Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.</p>",

Photograph: Peter Greig </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Greig</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When we set up <a href=\"http://www.pipersfarm.com/index.html\">Pipers farm</a> in the late 1980s our aim was always to deliver superb quality meat, which tasted delicious and offered value for money. We are the current holders of the BBC Food and Farming best producer award and are often singled out for praise on the food pages of newspapers and magazines. But we have never once been tempted to jump on the organic bandwagon.</p> <p>As far as my wife and I are concerned our standards are higher than organic. We demand more and we feel that for some farmers the organic label is simply a box-ticking exercise.</p> <p>For instance our meat is slaughtered at a local abattoir and that enables us to maintain complete control. Organic meat producers are still able to use an industrial abattoir and that's a standard which falls way below what we consider acceptable.</p> <p>I understand that for many of the public buying organic has become something of a touchstone. But in the long-term, customers are only going to return if they perceive you offer value for money. If the public are falling out of love with organic it might be partly because, in this time of belt-tightening, people are prioritising. If the so-called organic chicken they had the other week didn't really deliver a sensational meal then they might be tempted to switch back to something cheaper.</p> <p>At Pipers farm, we believe we have always offered something unique. The meat is either produced on our own 50-acre farm or by one of 30 small family farms in the local area. These farms carry out the day-to-day rearing of our animals. We control every aspect from breed to feed, rearing to butchery and in this way maintain absolute quality control. </p> <p>The livestock grown by these farms for Pipers farm is an \"add-on\" enterprise. For example, farmers' wives grow chickens, so earning an extra income from their farm. Farmers' sons rear pigs enabling them to return to the family farm with a secure income. What we do helps to preserve the infrastructure of smaller scale farming.</p> <p>Our animals are slow-grown to natural maturity. We then hang all of our meat until it reaches perfection. These are standards, not laid down by a certifying body, but worked out by us painstakingly over 20 years.</p> <p>Credit crunch or no credit crunch, our sales have in fact increased this year. If past increases in organic sales has been based on anything else than real value for money, then it is bound not to be sustainable.</p>",
  "<p>Last week the Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/aug/20/uksecurity.terrorism1\">uncovered a report</a> by MI5 suggesting there is no single pathway to Islamic extremism. What a surprise! And in a further deconstruction of preconceptions, the report found evidence that a well-established religious identity actually protects against violent radicalisation.<br> If this is the case, what are the implications for racial and religious profiling? The report clearly dismantles any assumptions that can be made about the identity, background and religiosity of a would-be terrorist. The UK's Muslim population is a mere 2.8% but is so ethnically diverse that the government could cynically use this report to sanction the continuing infringement of civil liberties of the entire population through ID cards, surveillance and so on. The sounding the death knell for racial profiling is something to celebrate, but I wonder whether my optimism is premature. Adam Khan, 28, from North London also has his reservations, after repeatedly being stopped and interrogated under <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2002/20021945.htm\">schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000</a> when trying to return to the UK.<br> Born in Enfield, London, Adam is of Malaysian Chinese and Pakistani heritage and describes himself as a practising Muslim of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufism\">Sufi</a> persuasion. He has no terrorist links, yet a sequence of tenuous coincidences brought him to the attention of MI5. After completing an MA in Middle Eastern studies, Adam visited Syria and Lebanon to work on his language skills, a perfectly routine journey that hundreds of Arabic language students from the UK undertake every year. He then spent a year working as a researcher for the Institute of Strategic Studies, a political thinktank in Islamabad. While he was in Pakistan he was flown by the Red Cross to Afghanistan to work with the international aid agency. <br> It was when he returned to the UK from Pakistan in July 2008 that Adam was first detained and held at Heathrow airport. Under Schedule 7 of the Terrorist Act, an individual can be detained for up to nine hours with recourse to a lawyer, but the interrogation will not be suspended in anticipation of the lawyer's arrival. Adam's DNA was taken and he was asked about his visits to Pakistan, Afghanistan, Syria and Lebanon. He was also asked about his sense of Britishness and how he felt about the Queen. At best, the questioning was facile, at worst alienating. By the time he was allowed to leave, Adam was inconvenienced and insulted but glad it was all over, particularly as he knew of many others who, under similar circumstances had experienced much worse. A couple of weeks later, Adam went to Berlin for a few days. Again, upon arriving back in the UK, at Luton airport, he was detained. This time he was less patient and demanded to know whether this would happen every time he travelled. He was pointedly told an option open to him was to work for MI5 and he should consider what they could offer him. He dismissed the suggestion outright. Adam has enlisted the support of his MP and is now seeking the advice of his lawyer, who advised that the taking of DNA and the line of questioning directed at him was an abuse of power, as he has never been under suspicion of terrorist activities. The experience, and the anticipation of future interrogations, has left him bitter and unsettled. He said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The ignorance of the officers was unbelievable. They make you feel you are a foreigner. They were constantly emphasising my connection to Pakistan and to the Islamic world, like they were saying 'You're not British'. You would think that in today's technological age, and the fact that they took my DNA they would have ruled me out and shouldn't need to harass me constantly.</p> </blockquote> <p>For too long, the security services have approached the threat of terrorism with tactics that alienate the very communities they need to engage with. The report shows that would-be terrorists are the products of British society, so let's not get distracted with unhelpful racial profiling and start to address the bigger questions.</p>",

  "<p>\"Whenever people agree with me, I feel that I must be wrong,\" said Oscar Wilde. As I feel the same way, I was pleased that when I came out of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/27/venicefilmfestival.coenbrothers1\">Burn After Reading</a>, the Coen brothers' feeble comedy-thriller which opened this year's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/venicefilmfestival\">Venice film festival</a>, I was surrounded by a number of critics and lesser mortals who expressed their liking for the film. </p> <p>Wilde also said, \"Everything popular is wrong.\" You have only to look at the international box office list to see that he was right. The ten biggest earners this week are The Dark Knight, The Mummy, Mamma Mia, Wall-E, You Don't Mess with the Zohan, Ponyo on the Cliff, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Ku Fu Panda, Singh is Kinng, The Chronicles of Narnia. You have to go down the list to number 35 - Matteo Garrone's Gomorra - before you can find a film that was not made for 12-year-olds or adults with the same mentality. </p> <p>I'm not so naively idealistic to expect the best films to be the most popular, but I would be content if the public were at least made more aware that another kind of cinema exists, and they need only step across the road from the McDonald's multiplex to the haute cuisine art cinema, to taste a new experience. It is up to professional critics to steer them in another direction, to lead public opinion, not to follow it.</p> <p>But as <a href=\"http://www.mencken.org\">HL Mencken</a> said, \"Nobody ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public.\" The public likes what they know, and, because of the Hollywood publicity machine, films choose people, people don't choose films. There exists an idea that a film, in order to be entertaining, must be simple-minded. I often hear \"if you check your brain at the door, you'll enjoy it\" about some puerile blockbuster. But I'd need a brain transplant to enjoy most of the films dubbed \"crowd pleasing\". The expression \"crowd pleaser\" is seen by many as something positive. By the same token, gladiator contests to the death in ancient Rome were crowdpleasers.<br> The Cannes and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/venicefilmfestival\">Venice</a> festivals, among others, have the misguided idea that you have to open a festival with a \"crowd pleaser\", preferably an American one. Burn After Reading is a \"crowd pleaser\", another attempt by the Coen Brothers to live down the time when their films were more personal, quirky and less commercial. Despite some strained attempts at contemporary relevance, their latest is really a very old-fashioned juvenile farce, with crude elements of the 70s paranoia films which - except for the stream of \"fucks\", it could have been made decades ago. </p> <p>Ironically, the film includes a mildly satiric extract from a mainstream Hollywood comedy called Coming Up Daisy, not too far from the sort of film that Burning After Reading is itself. The Coens also reveal so little confidence in their own convoluted plot, involving the CIA, that they make fun of it when an agent tries to explain the intricacies of the events to his superior, a scene that wouldn't have been out of place in an episode from 60s TV's <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tv.com%2FGet-Smart%2Fshow%2F1014%2Fsummary.html&amp;ei=Nb-3SL7vKJO-0QT9uJCKAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNF0Dlelk082SpF88wKu7lpLsM2fQQ&amp;sig2=-vJcY9NLGgZxToBLwDUHWQ\">Get Smart</a>. </p> <p>There are smart films about smart people (My Night with Maud, All About Eve), smart films about dumb people (Born Yesterday, Being There), but Burn Before Reading is a dumb film about dumb people. I'm now looking forward to seeing some good crowd-displeasing films. </p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/venicefilmfestival\">Read more about the Venice film festival</a></p>",

  "<p>When Tony Blair's first cabinet met in 1997, anyone trying to guess which faces would still be there a decade later would probably not have picked out Alistair Darling's. Back then, the chief secretary to the treasury already felt like part of the political furniture. But for a veteran, he seemed a strangely anonymous figure - opaque to the point of unknown.</p> <p>A blaze of glitzier New Labour stars have since fallen, yet Darling survived, accumulating five ministerial posts on a stainless ascent to the exchequer last year. His career had been distinguished by an almost freakish absence of failure. He has never lost an election, he joined the front bench after just 12 months in parliament, and 20 years later he has never left. Only two other members of that first cabinet, Gordon Brown and Jack Straw, are still in government with Darling today.</p> <p>Yet he remains something of an enigma. What is the occupant of Number 11 really like? Few outside his inner circle would claim to know. \"For most of my political life,\" Darling admits, \"I've kept out of doing this kind of interview. You have to be quite careful - unless you're one of those people who's happy to give everything of themselves. And I, for one, am not.\"</p> <p>In sunnier economic times, a chancellor might have been allowed the luxury of privacy. But people want to know if he is the man who can steer us out of trouble. After a stormy year of 10p tax rows, lost disks, the collapse of the housing market, rising prices and recession fears, rumours of his demotion are rumbling through Westminster. Darling gives no impression of believing them. But the mood is so febrile, it's even possible he won't be chancellor by the time this interview appears.</p> <p>The last time we met, on a Question Time panel 10 years ago, he had been rigid with nerves - a rod of anxiety in a suit - so I was wondering how we'd get through two days together on a remote Scottish island. The croft on Lewis in the outer Hebrides where we're heading belongs to Darling, his mother and his sisters, and has been a family retreat all his life. It is the place where, he says, he is happiest. When he greets us at the gate looking tanned and rumpled, a bowl of homemade soup in one hand, the other pointing to eagles overhead, I scarcely recognise him.</p> <p>We are welcomed like old friends by his wife, Maggie, a gregarious Scottish former journalist who cooks and makes tea and supper while Darling lights a fire. His dry, deadpan humour lends itself to his ironic take on the grumpy old man, which he plays with gruff good nature. Wendy Alexander, the former Scottish Labour leader, is \"not likable at all\"; Cherie Blair's memoirs were \"awful\", and as for the Dome - \"well, thank God I didn't have to go there on millennium night\". He can't abide this modern practice of kissing - people lurching at each other's faces - \"when they've never even met!\"</p> <p>He reminds me of childhood friends' fathers who seemed fearsome until we got old enough to realise they were being funny. His press adviser, Catherine, another Scottish former journalist, teases him about his limited wardrobe and reluctance to spend money. He doesn't like having his picture taken either, grumbling, \"It's like being at a wedding\" - but allows the photographer to take all the time he wants without once objecting. </p> <p>On the beach, the photographer asks him to look out to sea. He obediently gazes west across the Atlantic, murmuring, \"I am looking at the sub-prime market.\" Even when he gets soaked by a wave on the beach, he doesn't complain. \"Oh no, you didn't have your collar all scruffed up like that for the pictures, did you?\" Maggie exclaims when we get back to the house. \"But that's just what I look like,\" he says.</p> <p>\"Now Alistair,\" Catherine tells him firmly when eventually we sit down for the interview, \"tell her everything. Make sure you tell her everything.\"</p> <p>When his old friend handed over the keys to Number 11, Darling didn't expect the job to be easy. \"Becoming chancellor is completely different from any other appointment. Completely different. Even when times are easy, it's important, because you're dealing with money, and money affects how everything works. When times are far from easy, it's even more difficult. And we knew the economy was going to slow down.\" But he hadn't the faintest inkling of the financial crisis about to unfold before him. \"No, no one did. No one had any idea.\" </p> <p>He can clearly recall the day last summer when alarm bells first began to sound. The chancellor was on holiday with his wife and their two teenage children in Majorca. \"I remember I picked up the FT in the supermarket, as you do, and it had the European central bank starting to put money into the economy. I phoned the office to ask why they were doing quite so much. It didn't surprise me that money was going in - there was concern going around - but it was the sheer scale of it. I said, what about our institutions? This was when Northern Rock started to figure.\"</p> <p>When news broke of the first run on a British bank in more than a century, Darling was back in Edinburgh. \"I received a phone call and went straight down to London. From where I never returned. That was the last time I saw Edinburgh.\" </p> <p>Even then, the gravity of the credit crunch was still not fully clear. \"No one knew how serious it was yet.\" Then he received the second catastrophic phone call of last summer, from his private secretary - and this time the head of Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs was also on the line, with news of a major blunder.</p> <p>\"I just thought,\" Darling says, \"this is a disaster. This is terrible. I said, We have to search the place from top to bottom. One of them said, We'll start Monday. I said, No, we start today. I phoned Gordon up. I said, We appear to have lost two disks containing the personal details of just about every family in the country. We knew it was bad.\" What did Brown say? \"He said it was bad.\"</p> <p>Darling's life, in his wife's words, has been \"a crisis a week\" ever since. The economic times we are facing \"are arguably the worst they've been in 60 years,\" he says bluntly. \"And I think it's going to be more profound and long-lasting than people thought.\"</p> <p>In Edinburgh, Darling used to enjoy what would pass in Westminster for a healthy hinterland. He loves Leonard Cohen, and lists Midnight Express, Annie Hall and Local Hero as his favourite films. \"There's got to be a life outside politics. It was nice to go to the pictures and go for a nice meal afterwards. One of the great pleasures was getting to Edinburgh and going out for a meal with friends who don't do politics.\" </p> <p>But he has not been to the cinema in more than a year. His wife has moved down to Downing Street, and when they went for a meal with another couple recently, and tried to order a second bottle of wine, \"the waiter came over and said 'too much wine'. In a loud voice. So we stuck to the one bottle for the entire meal.\" Another meal out with his press adviser was reported in the News Of The World as a decadent affront to struggling families. \"It's just the way things are,\" he says, matter-of-factly. \"It's understandable.\"</p> <p>I wonder what it must be like for someone whose career had been hitherto blameless to find himself publicly upbraided by wine waiters. \"Well, I think most people understand perfectly well that most of the problems they face are international. However, that doesn't help sell their house. I was at a filling station recently, and a chap said, 'I know it's to do with oil prices - but what are you going to do about it?' People think, Well, surely you can do something, you are responsible - so of course it reflects on me.\" </p> <p>Is it painful to be blamed so personally? </p> <p>\"No, there's nothing more pathetic than people feeling sorry for themselves. So you get on with it, you just have to deal with it. There's lots of people who'd like to do my job. And no doubt,\" he adds, half under his breath, \"actively trying to do it.\"</p> <p>Ministers are seldom willing to discuss their own job prospects, so when I raise the rumours of an imminent reshuffle, I expect a formula along the lines of \"that's up to the prime minister\". But Darling can be surprisingly direct, and shakes his head impatiently.</p> <p>\"Frankly, if you had a reshuffle just now, I think the public would say, Who are they anyway? You name me a reshuffle that ever made a difference to a government, actually.\" Brown, he points out, had to make ministerial changes in January, following Peter Hain's resignation. \"And you can't be chopping and changing people that often. I mean, undoubtedly at some stage before the end of the parliament he will want to do a reshuffle, but I'm not expecting one imminently. I do not think there will be a reshuffle.\"</p> <p>Does he expect Labour to hang on to its seat at the forthcoming byelection? \"Well, we'll give it our best shot. But we've got our work cut out. This coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the Labour party has had in a generation, quite frankly. Both the general economic situation, and in terms of the politics. In the space of 10 months we've gone from a position where people generally felt we were doing OK to where we're certainly not doing OK. We've got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections, and that is a huge problem for us at the moment. People are pissed off with us.</p> <p>\"We really have to make our minds up; are we ready to try and persuade this country to support us for another term? Because the next 12 months are critical. It's still there to play for. But we've got a hell of a lot to do. We patently have not been able to get across what we are for, and what we are about.\"</p> <p>Can Brown communicate it? \"Yes, I do think he can. I do think he will.\" Then why hasn't he? \"Er, well,\" Darling falters. \"Well, it's always difficult, you know. You can always say, what could you have done better, and all the rest of it. But Gordon, in September, up to party conference, has got the opportunity to do that. And he will do that. It's absolutely imperative.\"</p> <p>Darling is one of Brown's closest and oldest political friends. When his daughter phones during dinner, she is babysitting for the prime minister; his wife is friends with Sarah Brown. The orchestra of criticism has been upsetting - \"We're grown-ups, but no one likes to read nasty things about their friends\" - and he flatly refuses to blame Brown for anything. There will not, he insists, be a leadership challenge. </p> <p>For Brown to repay his friend's loyalty by sacking him would be brutal - even Shakespearean. But then, politics can be like that. Darling is one of the most experienced politicians in the country. And yet, more than once, I find myself wondering how much of a political animal he really is.</p> <p>Darling was born in 1953, the eldest of four in a middle-class family that was neither tribal, nor intellectual, nor even Labour. Both his grandfathers had been Liberals, his great-uncle a Tory MP in Edinburgh, and his father, a civil engineer, voted Conservative. </p> <p>\"We were an ordinary family. We talked about events, but we didn't sit around the table having intense discussions about what Marx thought.\" Not like the Milibands, then? \"No,\" he agrees quickly. \"Very different people. But we had a very clear sense of what was right and what was wrong. My father always thought Conservatism was about helping people less fortunate than you. My mother was very clear about what you did and didn't do, she was very clear about saying thank you and being courteous.\"</p> <p>He was educated at Loretto, a rather traditional boarding school in Scotland. There was no teenage radicalism, and he would have been astonished, he says, if he'd known his future lay in politics. Studying law at Aberdeen, he stood for election in the student union, but not for a party. \"I was just quite interested in getting things done.\" His manifesto favoured \"strictly bread-and-butter issues, things like food prices in the student refectory\". When he joined the Labour party in 1977, he never expected to be more than a member. \"I was enjoying becoming a lawyer.\" He'd simply realised, he explains, that \"if you want to make any changes, there's only one way you can do it, and that's by getting into a position where you can influence things. And the obvious thing to do seemed to be to join a party.\" Why Labour? </p> <p>\"Just... I suppose, overall, I thought the Tories were unfair. They were only for one side, and not for everyone. The Labour party just seemed to reflect my outlook on life - you know, that we were better working together - fairness, helping everyone to get on, rather than just a few. The Labour government in 1977 was in a terrible mess, and I was getting fed up looking at all these things on the television, and thinking, God, surely we can do better than that. I wanted to do things. But I was never really interested in the theory of achieving things, just the practicality of doing things.\"</p> <p>One might say this has been Darling's great strength. The pragmatic clarity made him a highly effective minister, and probably explains why he was one of the few to maintain close relations with both Brown and Blair throughout their internecine rivalry. But it may well also be his weakness - for at times he seems almost too straightforward, even high-minded, for the low cunning of political warfare.</p> <p>Earlier this month, on the Today programme, the chancellor chose not to deny a newspaper report of a proposal under consideration for a holiday for stamp duty. Property sales promptly seized up as buyers held off to wait for his decision, and furious estate agents accused him of destroying what was left of the market. \"The news story didn't come from us,\" he protests, \"we weren't the ones who leaked it. It had already appeared in other newspapers before, and at any other time I would just have ignored it. But understandably, I was asked about it.\" The option of lying and denying it didn't seem to occur to him - but then nor, he admits, had the consequences for the property market of his words.</p> <p>If that was a schoolboy error, you might have thought Darling would want to put it right as quickly as he could, by issuing a definitive statement. \"When I've got something to say about housing,\" he retorts stiffly, \"then I need to deal with a whole range of things.\" If I was trying to sell my house right now, I would wish he'd hurry up. \"Yes, all right, but if you're going to announce anything in the housing market, you don't do it in the middle of August. It's just a silly time to do it.\" Does he feel no sense of urgency? \"I'll do it when I'm ready to do it.\"</p> <p>When voters are complaining that Labour seems indifferent to their problems, such an own goal seems mystifying. Other ministers are currently exhorting Labour to \"show\" the voters it cares - and Darling rightly scoffs at this line. \"I get very exasperated when people say we need to show people we are concerned. It's just the wrong approach. I think there's not a man, woman or child in this country who doesn't understand the problems people are facing. People are not particularly interested in public demonstrations of your 'understanding'. You just need to get on with it.\" Why he doesn't apply his own advice to stamp duty, and get on with it, is a mystery.</p> <p>It is also a gift to the opposition. George Osborne has grown adept at pouncing on such opportunities - yet when I ask Darling why his shadow would make a bad chancellor, he pauses before replying, \"I wouldn't personalise it. My criticism is not of him as an individual.\" But, I exclaim, Osborne is after your job! And he doesn't seem to mind personalising the fight. </p> <p>\"Why I think the Tories are bad is different from why I think Osborne would be a bad chancellor,\" Darling goes on. \"I think my criticisms are of the Tory party rather than him.\" But his criticisms are oddly contradictory, for one minute he says, \"the Tories haven't really changed. They may have packaged things differently, but fundamentally I think they are still very much focused on helping a few people, and not very bothered about most people.\" But then he says, \"There are times when I listen to Cameron and I'm not sure what he does believe in. I don't say that in any nasty sense. I just don't have any sense of what, if he was prime minister, he would want to do.\"</p> <p>When you are trailing by more than 20 points in the polls, it's probably time to start fighting dirty. Yet Darling continues, \"I think you're right, George Osborne is a politician, and he's made an enormous amount of promises, but it's not clear how he would pay for them. Osborne knows what he's doing in terms of playing the political field. That's why I say he's a very good politician, because he takes his moment. But what's his long-term view of where the country needs to go? What is his vision for the future? What sort of country does he see Britain becoming in the next 20 to 30 years? I just don't know.\"</p> <p>In the current climate, I'm not sure voters give a stuff about abstract visions for a generation away. But Darling does share most people's daily concerns - probably more than Osborne, the son of a titled millionaire, ever could. He does the family shopping in Tesco, and when I test him on the price of groceries he is spot-on. \"Half a dozen eggs? That would be \u00a31.20. I know they have cheaper ones, I saw them. But the ones my wife specifically wanted were \u00a31.20.\"</p> <p>If Darling lacks the pugnacity of a devious old Labour bruiser, he also struggles to compensate for it with a new Labour instinct for spin. \"Throughout my life,\" he agrees, \"I much prefer to be doing things than shouting about them.\" Of course, he adds, \"part of politics is you do need to shout. Politics is the art of communication. If you can't communicate, then it doesn't matter if you're truly brilliant as a technocrat. There are lots of people who are very good, but they just can't communicate it.\" He doesn't say so, but I suspect this is a lesson he has learned most forcibly since Brown took charge. </p> <p>What did he think, I ask, when he saw the photographs of the Browns and the Camerons on their holidays. \"Well, it was the same reaction I used to have with the Blairs - thank God I don't have to do that.\" Didn't he notice any presentational issues?</p> <p>\"Well, they're just different people.\" he says. \"I mean, it was probably an accurate representation of both of them. I didn't... Honestly, I just couldn't get excited about those pictures one way or the other. I mean, of course they're both posed. Cameron was as posed as they come!\" But the trick, I suggest, is appearing relaxed even when posing. \"Well, to me it looked posed,\" he retorts. \"But I'm not going to be hypocritical about it when I've spent 15 minutes on a beach being photographed in a very unnatural posture.\" </p> <p>Maybe, he reflects, \"that's why I'm not a great politician. You know, I'm not very good at looking at pictures and subjecting them to the equivalent of textual analysis.\" </p> <p>The funny thing is, on paper, Darling should be the perfect politician. He is exactly what the public always says it wants: decent, straightforward, unostentatious. The ideological intensity of Brown unnerves voters, and they didn't trust Blair's showmanship - but if Darling has vanity it seems invested entirely in doing the job well. He doesn't call himself a socialist - \"There's nothing wrong with the term, it's just not one I use\" - and feels uncomfortable with political labels. Class envy is a mystery to him; he sees no point in raising taxes for the super rich, because, he says, it wouldn't raise much revenue. \"I'm not offended if someone earns large sums of money. Is it fair or not? It's just a fact of life.\" Asked to define his politics, he offers, \"Pragmatic. I passionately believe in living in a fair country, and treating people properly, with proper respect and fairness.\"</p> <p>Until the past year, Darling has never really had to fight. \"For 10 years,\" he acknowledges, \"as a minister, by and large I had a charmed life. I was sorting out problems rather than being landed with them.\" For the first time he is now facing an effective opposition - and the possibility of failure. The intriguing question will be whether he can survive, without the old political fuel of ideology or ego to drive him.</p>",
  "<p>After narrowly avoiding <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/30/turkey.nato1\">being shut down</a> by the judiciary for undermining the secular freedoms guaranteed by the constitution, the ruling Islamic party in Turkey, the AKP, has become extremely nervous of introducing any legislation that appears to advance the religious agenda. A protection of youth bill that contained anti-porn measures was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/14/islam.religion\">hastily dumped</a> after an outcry from secular forces. </p> <p>In the context of the debates on pornography that take place in the UK, it seemed odd that the Turkish government had to stake its claim of being secular by adopting a libertarian position on pornography. Here, the debate is sharply divided between libertarians, who argue that pornography is the business of consenting adults, and not that of the state, and feminists, who oppose pornography on the grounds that it degrades women. </p> <p>The law might seem an attractive tool in the fight against pornography because it signals what is unacceptable to society. Of course, British feminists recognise that the banning of pornography can be problematical, not merely because the dividing line between pornography and erotica is so fluid, but because it vests too much power in the state. Historically, such legislation has been used more broadly than intended to crack down on any sexually explicit material, often lesbian and gay material, without regard to whether it is exploitative. It is because of the dangers posed by a powerful state that Turkish feminists, whose views have so far gone unreported, are opposed to the bill.</p> <p>Meltem Arikan, a Turkish <a href=\"http://www.redpepper.org.uk/Disturbing-family-order\"> writer and feminist</a>, felt the heavy hand of the state when her book, Don't Hurt My Flesh, based on interviews with children who had experienced incest and abuse at home, was banned in 2004 under legislation designed to protect children from pornography. She had to defend the book in court before the ban was lifted. She believes that the protection of youth bill should have been called the policing of youth bill, because its provisions are designed to monitor and restrict the movements of young people. The bill proposed, for instance, that unaccompanied under-18s should not be allowed into restaurants after 10pm; true protection of young people would require the government to take steps towards prevention of abuse within the family. As far as the religious establishment is concerned, the family is sacrosanct, and any investigation into incest is out of bounds. Arikan suspects:</p> <blockquote> <p>The government wants to use the protection of youth as an excuse to attack secularism, which was established in Turkey around 80 years ago. Therefore, feminists of Turkey, who are aware of the secret purpose of the government, are against the law.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, new legislation in the UK, the <a href=\" ww.justice.gov.uk/publications/criminal-justice-bill.htm\"> Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008</a>, makes it an offence to be in possession of images of extreme pornography. It remains to be seen whether there will be a consensus on what constitutes \"extreme\". And whether a more liberal state can be trusted to make judgments that protect women from degradation. </p> <p>Given the different alignment of social and political forces here, the anti-porn campaign has made feminists uneasy bedfellows with the religious lobby, which opposes porn on grounds of morality. The feminist agenda is, of course, quite distinct. We need to carve out a space for women to express our sexuality, distinct from constructions of women's sexuality by exploitative industries such as porn or prostitution, or the controlling strictures of religion.</p>",
  "<p>John Lennon's troubled adolescence is to be the subject of a film from the writer of Control and the artist Sam Taylor-Wood.</p> <p>Matt Greenhalgh, who won a Bafta for his screenplay about the final years of Joy Division's Ian Curtis, is to focus his script on the lonely teenage years of the future Beatle, who was raised by his authoritarian aunt after being abandoned by his mother. In the film, titled Nowhere Boy, Lennon finds solace in his music, art and friendship with Paul McCartney.</p> <p>Taylor-Wood, who will be making her feature debut on the project, will shoot on location in Liverpool in the area where Lennon grew up. Casting is said to be underway on the project, and the Daily Mail <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1050388/BAZ-BAMIGBOYE-John-Lennon-film-All-need-Kate-Winslet.html\">reports</a> today that Kate Winslet is being encouraged to audition for the role of Lennon's mother, Julia.</p> <p>\"The women in John's early life truly shaped who he became,\" Taylor-Wood told the <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i22e2d720f4d22efdeee2560adddff667\">Hollywood Reporter</a>. \"And the strengths and weaknesses of their relationships are central to this film.\"</p> <p>The feature is being financed by Ecosse Films, with the support of the Film Council. It's not the first film to focus on Lennon, who as part of the Beatles was the subject of 1994's Backbeat, which focused on the band's early career in Hamburg. There was also 1991's The Hours and the Times, a fictionalised account of what might have happened when Lennon and Beatles manager Brian Epstein took a holiday together in 1963. Lennon was played by Ian Hart on both occasions.</p> <p>Last year's The Killing of John Lennon centred on the final hours of Lennon's life from the perspective of his murderer, Mark Chapman.</p> <p>While not having directed a feature film before, Taylor-Wood has a history working with musicians. She has produced films based on the Pet Shop Boys' Somewhere concerts at the Savoy theatre in London and made a promotional video starring Robert Downey Jr for the 2001 Elton John single I Want Love.</p>",
  "<p>Tonight was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.democrats20082\">Big Speech</a>, the night we've all been waiting for, the night to which the talking heads have been feverishly alluding all week, with ominous predictions and loaded rhetoricals about whether Barack Obama can live up to the hype, and whether he will leave the stage a nominee from a fractured or a unified party. And, of course, whether one or both of the Clintons will rush the stage and declare Hillary Clinton Queen of the Universe.</p> <p>It could happen.</p> <p>I know \u2013 because the talking heads in America's Cable News Land have been telling me so <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/uselections2008.television\">all</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/28/uselections2008.television\">week</a>.</p> <p>Hours before the main event, I flip to MSNBC just in time to see a brazen bystander <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ooA1ZqzWE\">touch the holy grail of Chris Matthews's mad hair</a>. Jealousy consumes me. It is the first time I've wished I were in Denver.</p> <p>Inside Mile-High Stadium, we are treated to some music. Will.I.Am gives us a nice live rendition of <a href=\"http://www.dipdive.com/dip-politics/ywc/\">Yes We Can</a>, which is followed by some canned music as Sheryl Crow sets up shop. On comes Bowie's cover of The Beatles' Across the Universe. \"Nothing's gonna change my world\u2026.\" Does not compute. It's not only a poor choice for the Change candidate, but it also fucks with one of my most closely-held truths, which is that everything always needs more Bowie, any Bowie.</p> <p>There's nothing going on. It's all about the wait \u2013 just filling time until the Big Speech.</p> <p>Savannah in the Cheap Seats, aka Savannah Guthrie, interviews a guy in the nosebleed section who says he likes Obama because \"I'm for people and Obama's for people.\" I would like to say something snide about how long we've all waited for a president who has the guts to be \"for people,\" but then I remember the last eight years and consider that tomorrow is the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina\u2026 After ten minutes or so spent weeping in the foetal position, I unfold myself and refocus, discovering Virginia Governor Tim Kaine complaining about John McCain's seven houses. Hey, at least he <a href=\"http://www.publicintegrity.org/blog/entry/689/\">doesn't have 55</a>.</p> <p>More filler. Am I really watching <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Buchanan\">Pat Buchanan</a> wearing shades and desk-dancing to Stevie Wonder? What planet am I on?</p> <p>Over at Fox News, they're STILL talking about McCain. Sean Hannity <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2aqyKYSKSo\">complains grumpily</a> that during the Big Speech, we're not going to hear that Obama will cavort with dictators and we're not going to hear that Obama will raise taxes and we're not going to hear how the surge has been a success and we're not going to hear how the economy is awesome. Pout. I hope someone is standing by to resuscitate Hannity when Obama fails to talk about how he's going to enslave White America.</p> <p>Ugh, Dick Morris \u2013 snivelling cretin. Morris, Hannity, and Alan Colmes banter briefly about Obama's speech. Who needs to actually watch the speech when you've got Fox News to tell you what to think about it before it even happens? Morris is certain it will stink based on provided excerpts. (Rarely do you find such an outstanding specimen of man, who is both <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Morris#Fallout\">toe-sucker</a> and oracle.) Coming up on Fox's coverage of the Democratic convention: More speculation about McCain's veep selection.</p> <p>Meanwhile, back on MSNBC, Keith Olbermann and company are analysing the long camera shots showing the (truly impressively) crowded stadium. Olbermann frets that it will make Obama look \"smaller than life rather than bigger than life.\" Gee, well, let's hope he gets a close-up or two!</p> <p>How much are these people paid?</p> <p>Joe Biden takes the stage. I think there may be more people in the stadium than in the entire state of Delaware. He's loving it. He ends his speech, Rat Pack-like, with \"Love ya!\" which I have to say I much prefer to \"God Bless You.\" \"Love ya!\" has some real bada-bing.</p> <p>Filler, filler. Now the gang at MSNBC are pouring over the speech excerpts, and, while they're doing a better job than the loathsome Morris, it's still painful. If Nora O'Donnell refers to the \"optics of this event\" one more time, I'll go on a killing spree. It's nonetheless an improvement on what's going down at Fox, where they're rehashing \"the Jeremiah Wright scandal\" and Brit Hume begrudgingly admits that Mile-High Stadium is \"pretty full.\" It's full metal crazy over there.</p> <p>Finally, at long last, the senior senator from Illinois, Dick Durbin, comes out to introduce Obama, and we are moments away from the Big Speech. Jitter. Durbin's followed by a bio piece about Obama and his family, which is very nice.</p> <p>And then Obama comes out.</p> <p>Cameras flash like frenzied lightning bugs and the crowd roars. The staging is amazing. It is truly worthy of the historic moment to which we're all bearing witness \u2013 this is an African-American man who has is accepting the nomination for the presidency by the Democratic party. Wow. I am without cynicism or snark. I am awed.</p> <p>I listen to the speech.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>It's over. Chris Matthews, being uncharacteristically generous, says it was the hard-fought primary against Hillary Clinton that gave Obama \"the steel\" to be able to make this brilliant speech and live up to the enormous expectations and the overwhelming venue; he is palpably jizzing in his pants over the entire spectacle. I leave him to his private moment and check in with Fox. Brit Hume continues to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvcNTCpY5KI\">begrudge Obama his success</a>, and nearly refers to the candidate as \"Barack Obama,\" but quickly corrects himself to use Fox News in-house style: \"Barack Hussein Obama.\"</p> <p>Over at CNN, Anderson Cooper compulsively refers to everyone who liked the speech as having \"drunk the Kool-Aid.\" GOP consultant Alex Castellanos looks vaguely nauseated. If I had to go up against Obama with McCain, I'd be looking ill myself. Cooper and Wolf Blitzer discuss the speech with Campbell Brown, Paul Begala, and some other nitwits. The segment should be called How to Talk About Race Without Talking About Race. They agree Obama was not too uppity, which is euphemised as eschewing rhetoric that was \"too soaring,\" and compliment his ability to \"throw a punch\" at McCain while not looking like the wild-eyed Angry Black Man, which is euphemised as being \"formidable.\"</p> <p>Blitzer then promises to talk to Clinton supporters after the break and see if Obama managed to win them over. Insert ominous score here. When we come back, Jessica Yellin is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu9nvEduJ1s\">standing with</a> an adorable elderly woman dressed head to toe in pink. She tells Yellin she's now an Obama supporter. What won her over? He did.</p> <p>\"The end is what got me. You know, it's a dream and it's going to come true. We gotta work for it.\"</p> <p>And thus does the media-created story arc of the Democratic Convention come to a tidy end. The dragon of disunity has been slain, and Obama rides off into the sunset on his unity pony.</p> <p>Who, I've been told, is fixing to graze on the lush lawns at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>",
  "<p>Was it God or Mammon that led to the \"no\" vote in Ireland's referendum on the EU Lisbon reform treaty? The leader of the country's Catholics certainly seems to think Lisbon's rejection last June was down to the former ... or at least the fact that He wasn't around. </p> <p>Cardinal Sean Brady this week presented the absence of God in a supposedly ever-increasingly secular Europe as a major factor in voters' disillusionment with the EU project. The cardinal used a speech at a summer school to suggest in the strongest possible terms that the EU was promoting anti-family, anti-life and anti-Christian decisions. He even went as far as to say that some normally Europhile Christian voters were prompted to vote \"no\" because they perceived the EU as hostile to religion. </p> <p>The irony of the particular summer school Cardinal Brady chose to launch his broadside against European secularism appeared lost on him and many others this week. The venue was the Humbert summer school in Killala, County Mayo, which was named after the French revolutionary general who commanded a doomed military operation to end British rule in the late 18th century. </p> <p>General Jean Joseph Amable Humbert emerged from the seizures of 1789 and the French revolution, a movement that was as fiercely anti-clerical as it was anti-monarchical. In the years running up to the general's invasion and attempted liberation of western Ireland, successive revolutionary regimes fought bloody battles against the power of the Catholic church. Those struggles produced the secular French constitution of today with its strict separation of church and state. </p> <p>Ireland doesn't have a French-style constitution, which among other things bans the display of religious symbols in schools. Unlike France, the Irish Republic still maintains a special position in public life for the Roman Catholic faith: abortion remains banned, the tolling of the Angelus Bells (the Catholic call to prayer) still rings out at 6pm every night on the Irish public television broadcaster, the church controls the vast majority of schools in the state, where the crucifix and other religious images are common. </p> <p>Even as late as 2001, just as Bertie Ahern's first administration was winding up and preparing for the general election, Irish ministers rushed through a law that gave the Catholic church immunity from paying compensation to the child victims of clerical sex abuse. Instead, the first Ahern government ensured that the Irish taxpayer would be picking up the tab (running into tens of millions) for the church's crimes. The EU has never threatened or sought to overturn any of the above. </p> <p>None the less, hardline Irish Catholics have never forgiven Europe over what they regard as interference in the republic's affairs. </p> <p>The battle lines with Brussels were drawn back in the early 1990s, when the Irish authorities attempted to prevent a 14-year-old rape victim pregnant by her attacker travelling to Britain for an abortion. </p> <p>The cack-handed way the government handled the affair created headlines around the world, with Dublin accused of reintroducing internment on the island \u2013 this time for young girls. What became known as the \"X case\" was followed by a series of scandals that rocked the church hierarchy, ranging from paedophile priests to bishops fathering children and using the collection plate funds to cover up their tracks. </p> <p>In Cardinal Brady's universe there is a simple black/white distinction between the good religious world and the very bad, nasty secular one. In his and the minds of other senior figures in the Irish Catholic church the historic crimes of the 20th century \u2013 the Holocaust, the gulags, the Great Leap Forwards, Year Zero \u2013 are merely the toxic by-product of European secularism. Of course, this ignores entirely the role of both Catholic and Protestant theology in the antisemitism preceding the Shoah or sectarian slaughter from the Balkans to Ulster. </p> <p>None of the major Irish political parties in the early 21st century today seeks to portray themselves as the defenders of the faith of our fathers. Despite fire-proofing the church from costly legal actions, political careers are no longer destroyed (as they were in the past) over accusations that someone in public life is irreligious or Godless or gay. </p> <p>Unlike in Northern Ireland, where politicians such as Iris Robinson, the first minister's wife, can label homosexuality an \"abomination\" which can be cured by psychiatry, no party seeks to exploit personal moral issues or pick on sexual or religious minorities. </p> <p>Nor is there an appetite in an increasingly multi-faith society for Ireland to turn the clock back to the days when condoms were illegal and no one dared say boo to a Catholic bishop. The age of absolute reverence to Rome among Ireland's a la carte Catholics has passed.</p>",

But with each week of his nascent captaincy, the promise grows that before the premature ending there will be some glorious moments.\" Amen to that. We have yet to see how he copes with hardship, something Vaughan did exceptionally well in his first spell, but Pietersen has been exceptional so far.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>Links bit</strong> So <a href=\"http://www.yearbookyourself.com/\">here</a> we have a fun page where you can dress yourself up as a 60s ruffian and the like; <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/strangersonatrain\">here</a> we have an upcoming awards night that I might attend just in case the new (or old) Emmy The Great is there; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cricket-Lovely-Addicts-Worlds-Exasperating/dp/022407914X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1219997342&amp;sr=1-1\">here</a> we have Booth's new book, the office copy of which I'm going to nick when nobody's looking; and <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/telepathy\">here</a> we have some exciting new music (listen to Devil's Trident).</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>Stop whatever you're doing and read this</strong>.

It makes every stitch a cinch, every wheeze a breeze, and puts every single measly facet of our lives in their appropriate context.</p> <p>And, finally, warmest thanks to all of you who have sponsored us so far: the generosity proves that, while OBOers are a humourless bunch who couldn't produce a rib-tickling email between them, their hearts are in the right place.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>Technical update</strong> It's working, but slowly, so updates might be 15 minutes after each over. What do you mean that's the norm?</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>1st over: England 1-0 (Bell 1, Prior 0)</strong> When we pull back the curtains the first thing we do is look up. When we start a cricket game the first thing we do is look for swing. There is some for Steyn, but it comes slowly off the pitch and there's not much sign of bounce. Bell shoulders arms at four of the deliveries, and tucks the last one off his pads to get off the mark.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>2nd over: England 1-0 (Bell 1, Prior 0)</strong> Bell has this rigidly defined role, to bat through for 120 not out, and as discussed a week ago it really is a nonsense in the modern game. On he plods, with all the time in the world to get his eye in: a maiden, and Bell's strike-rate is 8.33, although it's not fair to expect him to go that fast all the time. No sign of pace in this pitch, although people still expect any at the Oval I don't know. It hasn't had any for over a decade.</p> <p>In football, incidentally, Everton have agreed to sign Louis Saha <em>subject to medical</em>. Which is a bit like saying Scarlett Johansson has agreed to marry me, <em>subject to meeting me</em>.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>3rd over: England 10-0 (Bell 9, Prior 0)</strong> <em>That's</em> what Bell can do. Steyn overpitches only a fraction and Bell drives him sumptuously down the ground for four. The next ball is short, lollops it nicely and is swivel-pulled for four more. Bell has the shots to be our Tendulkar/Mark Waugh at the top of the order. What was it En Vogue said about freeing your mind?</p> <p>\"Morning Rob,\" says Luke Dealtry. \"Slightly worried about your use of the word 'Presactly'- hoping you're not going to go down the route of that heinous David Lynch <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRnS-Zuhytk\">Nissan advert</a> and start spouting such<br>linguistic aberrations as 'Spafe', 'Modro' and the unutterable 'Spig'.\" I'm not that loathtidious.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>4th over: England 27-0 (Bell 9, Prior 14)</strong> An over of the highest farce, missing only a bit of Benny Hill. It starts when Prior makes it three fours in as many balls when he creams Ntini's first delivery through extra-cover. The reply is a preposterous jaffa, a kicking leg-cutter that is even harder to play because of the wide angle. The next ball is the same, and seems to take the edge on the way through to Boucher. Ntini celebrates, Mike Atherton shouts \"gone\", but Kent legend Nigel Llong, the rich man's Gower in his pomp, says no. Replays show it's an outstanding decision, as it flicked the thigh pad. </p> <p>The next ball is a no-ball, so a free hit. From that free hit, which is sliced over the slips for four by Prior, it's <em>another</em> no-ball. Then he bowls a wide, and from the next ball - still a free hit; keep up with me now - Prior gets his back leg out of the way and smears it over long-on for a regal six.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>5th over: England 31-0 (Bell 13, Prior 14)</strong> It has, as Athers points out, been an odd morning: South Africa have bowled a fair few jaffas but enough garbage for England to tick along. There's four more, tucked off the pads by Bell off Steyn.</p> <p>\"South London is a steamy sauna today,\" says Gary Naylor, whipping off his clothes in front of some startled grannies, \"and ideal for swing. Last night, Sky were making a big play of The Oval being a fast-scoring ground, but omitted to point out that it is also a wicket-taking ground for new ball bowlers. The long-suffering Surrey membership have seen a few 21-4 scoreboards this season. A 75-ball fifty from Belly Boy would be handy right now.\"</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>6th over: England 35-0 (Bell 13, Prior 18)</strong> A more sober over from Ntini, although it could hardly fail to be, but there's four more to Prior, crashed with real authority through the covers off the back foot. By golly he can look a good player.</p> <p>I just used the word golly, didn't I? </p> <p>\"England have won the Ashes, subject to playing them?\" offers Mike Holland.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>7th over: England 46-0 (Bell 24, Prior 18)</strong> Lovely from Bell, who flicks Steyn lazily over square leg for four. Then he goes again, this time over midwicket. Two quite exquisite strokes. This is the thing with Bell: he absolutely has the game to open in one-day cricket; he just needs to step on it a bit. He's doing it today and this is the result: 24 from 25 balls. </p> <p>\"Two overs in and you're ALREADY having a go at Bell....... give it a rest!\" says Rob Smith. \"Having just hit a couple of cracking boundaries, is it time to reconsider? And have you thought that maybe he's batting to the orders of the management or captain?\" I would have thought the phrase 'rigidly defined role' suggested that. Next!</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>8th over: England 59-0 (Bell 36, Prior 18)</strong> South Africa are haemorrhaging runs the noo, by fair means or foul. In that over Bell edges Ntini twice for four: once low, but once right in the gap between Boucher and Kallis, who was at about second slip. Bell salts the wound with a withering pull stroke for four more next ball. He is playing beautifully today.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>In other news</strong>, Barney Ronay slipped into the special Small Talk underpants last week and went to meet Sourav Ganguly. Click <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/29/indiacricketteam.cricket\">here</a> to find out how they bonded and whether it was a fully-fledged bromance.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>9th over: England 63-0 (Bell 36, Prior 22)</strong> Morne Morkel replaces Steyn (4-0-25-0), but the boundaries continue to come: Prior has a gentle little walk down the track and times Morkel square on the off side. Morkel responds by beating Prior. They must have gone past the outside edge at least 10 times this morning. I always get excited when I can type the words \"curate's\" and \"egg\", and they certainly apply this morning.</p> <p>Our warmest thanks to Hong King Centaurs Cricket Club, not only for being called Hong Kong Centaurs Cricket Club but also for a particularly generous donation ahead of Sunday's run.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>10th over: England 77-0 (Bell 50, Prior 22)</strong> Well played Ian Bell. This has been a gem of an innings. He goes to fifty from 36 balls with 464 off consecutive deliveries from Ntini. The first was blitzed through extra-cover on the up, the second driven gloriously over long-off, and the third cut behind point. Brilliant stuff, and England have taken 76 from the last eight overs.</p> <p>Here's Sam Walker. \"Typical England: just as the world starts predicting the demise of 50-over cricket, we finally look like a team who can compete in the longer format!\" Fair point, that, even if the exclamation mark wasn't strictly necessary. Understated jauntiness is so much more rewarding. Anyway, I'm great with a Rubik's Cube and can quote entire episodes of the Young Ones in the pub, but what good's that? It's all Peep Show and strap-ons these days.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>11th over: England 83-0 (Bell 50, Prior 27)</strong> An absolute brute from Morkel follows Prior, takes the glove and loops over the slips for four. England are riding their luck, for sure, but they're riding it with vigour, shouting 'yeeha!' and 'giddy up buttercup!' at every opportunity.</p> <p>Anyone out there? It's all a bit cricket. Come on, this is great stuff! Oh, here's one. \"Re: 3rd over, 'presactly' and Luke Dealtry,\" says Tom Burford-Taylor IV. \"May I offer you my deepest confibularities for reminding me of a fantastic episode of Blackadder III.\"</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>12th over: England 89-0 (Bell 52, Prior 31)</strong> Albie Morkel - what sort of a name is that for a human being - comes on for Ntini (5-1-47-0), and Prior edges an attempted yorker to third man for a couple before working one through midwicket for two more. If England carry on at this rate, they'll get 371. It's all rather good, this.</p> <p>I just used the phrase 'rather good', didn't I?</p> <p>\"Rob Smyth has completed his 13-mile run,\" says Tom Hopkins, \"subject to being carried for the last 12 miles?\" You should see some of the other chancers who are doing it.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>13th over: England 96-0 (Bell 59, Prior 31)</strong> Botham asks what a good score would be. This is an important point because sometimes England's minds aren't free enough. From here Australia would be looking for maybe 360; you suspect England will have their sights on 300. </p> <p>Shots like that will help: Bell drives Morkel on the up through mid-off for another delicious boundary. Talking of which, here's Richard Marsden. \"Over 2: 'Bell's strike-rate is 8.33, although it's not fair to expect him to go that fast all the time.' Would you like chips, new potatoes or salad with your words, sir?\" I'll have a beer.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>14th over: England 97-0 (Bell 60, Prior 31)</strong> A tight over Morkel (Albie), and in his haste to get a run Matt Prior is almost run out by de Villiers at backward point.</p> <p>\"Without looking, doesn't Tom Burford-Taylor IV mean 'contrafibularities'?\" says James Galea. \"Apologies for the pericombobulation.\"</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>15th over: England 99-0 (Bell 62, Prior 31)</strong> Bit of luck for Bell. He backed away, Morkel (Morne) followed him, and Bell inside-edged to fine leg for a couple. The two brothers have put the brakes on a bit, as South Africa desperately needed them to.</p> <p><strong>IMPORTANT PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT FROM GORDON PITTENDRIGH</strong> \"Hello. I have a bad hangover. Thanks.\"</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 101-1 (Prior c Gibbs b A Morkel 33)</strong> Bah and balls. Prior tries to pull Albie Morkel, but it's on him too quickly and it loops into the covers, where Gibbs takes a sprawling catch. The frequency with which Prior gets out in the 30s in a one-dayer is starting to rival Ramprakash's spooky series of twentysomethings in his debut Test series in 1991.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>16th over: England 109-1 (Bell 62, Shah 1)</strong> A bouncer from Albie Morkel flies over Boucher's head for five wides. Contrary to what I said earlier, this pitch does have a bit in it, and England's battery of basketball players should enjoy bowling on it. \"Re: the other chancers in over 12,\" begins Tom Hopkins. \"You're not wrong. Have you met Dave Hopkins yet? I'm not sure he could make 13 miles in a car.\"</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>17th over: England 109-1 (Bell 62, Shah 1)</strong> Bell is suddenly becalmed: at one stage he had 58 from 43 deliveries and now, after that maiden, he has 62 from 63. You do the match. The Morkels have really pulled this back: they have combined figures of one for 36 from eight. Weren't they Ben Hollioake's figures on his ODI debut, only without the wicket?</p> <p>Another link, the last one I promise: this one's to a <a href=\"http://www.spinpodcast.com\">podcast</a> on which I get pretty much everything except my name wrong.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>18th over: England 116-1 (Bell 63, Shah 6)</strong> Shah leans into a really fibrous cover-drive off Albie Morkel, sending it skimming to the fence. I'm still not convinced about Shah at No3, but time will tell. There aren't too many alternatives I suppose. I'd like to see Bopara there personally. It's all mememe round here.</p> <p>\"Albie really isn't a name for a human being,\" says Will Burchell. \"As every Flight of the Conchords fan (which really should be everybody by now) knows, Albie is a name for a racist dragon.\"</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>19th over: England 120-1 (Bell 65, Shah 7)</strong> Maybe we're entering an age of the change bowler in one-dayers: England's most important two are pitch-hitters, as are South Africa's. They have done very well here, although there's a front-foot no-ball from Morne Morkel in that over, and thus a free hit. Shah has a huge roundhouse swing at a short one and misses it. England have taken only 24 from the last six overs, and South Africa will be happy with that given that we're in Powerplay territory.</p> <p>\"If England score a massive total, I can see South Africa having a better chance of winning than if they only score 250ish,\" says Andy Bradshaw. \"Mainly because the Saffers have nothing to lose but giving it the long handle and hoping for the best.\" It sounds absurd, but I know what you mean - the same thing as happened in that amazing match 872-run ODI against the Aussies at Jo'burg. So I fully expect to see Flintoff and co turn down singles once we reach 250.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>20th over: England 126-1 (Bell 66, Shah 11)</strong> Ah ya. Albie Morkel digs it in and Shah plays the most regal pull stroke, high over midwicket for four. When Shah is playing well he treats bowlers with the most thrilling contempt.</p> <p>\"Honestly, Rob - you'd have to go back a whole year and two days to<br>find the last time that Prior got out for 30-something in an ODI,\" says Scott Collier. Ah, well fair enough. But you know what I mean: getting out when set to a limp stroke.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>21st over: England 128-1 (Bell 67, Shah 12)</strong> An important time in the game, this, as the spinner Botha comes on. Important in particular for Bell, who needs to take at least three singles from every four balls. For now it's Shah for most of the over, and he permits himself a look at Botha. Two from the over.</p> <p>\"Never mind old Blackadder scripts: Clare Davies, Lee Calvert and I invented a few words at the <a href=\"http://www.thegoogly.com/cricket_lexicon/index.html\">Cricket Lexicon</a>,\" says Gary Naylor. \"This one seems about right for the moment: Bell (v) - To maintain oneself in a game, but no more. Usage - 'When holding middle pair on the flop, a good Texas Hold'em player doesn't raise or fold, but just bells until the turn card is revealed.' 360 would be a full house; 300 just a two pair.\"</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>22nd over: England 132-1 (Bell 69, Shah 14)</strong> Steyn is back, at the opposite end from where he bowled this morning. England have definitely dropped down a gear, which is completely unnecessary when you have so many batsmen to come. Four singles from the over.</p> <p>Andrew Brittain is a funny man. A really, really funny man. \"When/if Bell is out why don't you say: 'Well we've seen the innings of Bell begin and now we've seen the innings of Bell end'. Use it if you want. I give it to you free of charge.\"</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>23rd over: England 138-1 (Bell 72, Shah 17)</strong> Shah's single takes him to 1000 in ODIs. When he charmed us all with his intrepid performances in his debut series in 2001, you'd have got long odds on it taking seven years for him to reach that little milestone. Anyway it's a good over for England, who do what all good teams do against modest spinners - get a run a ball with minimal risk.</p> <p>\"PLEASE CALL ME AND GET BACK TO MY EMAIL: 00226-70 64 24 10,\" demands Muhamadad Allauddin. Must be another booty call.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>24th over: England 143-1 (Bell 72, Shah 22)</strong> Another wonderfully dismissive stroke from Shah, pulling Steyn to the fence at midwicket. Then he agrees to a ludicrous single and, had de Villiers running in from backward point hit the stumps, Bell would have been long gone. That's just reminded of Long Gone by the Super Furries. Halcyon days.</p> <p>Kristian Petterson has a steel toecap on his size 9s, and he wants to move it forcefully in the direction of my dusters. \"Having now flogged the same gag twice, I was just wondering if you planned to use the word 'presactly' on any more occasions on August 29th?\"</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 143-2 (Bell LBW b Botha 73)</strong> South Africa are the ones celebrating but I reckon this is better news for England. Bell, beaten for pace and trapped in front on the back foot, has gone and Pietersen is in at pretty much the perfect time. Bell played stunningly well at the start but made only 15 from his last 34 deliveries.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>25th over: England 146-2 (Shah 23, Pietersen 2)</strong> I may have the individual scores wrong. So sue me! </p> <p>\"If he became a lifeguard you could get saved by the Bell,\" says Dave Whittam. \"I'm so sorry.\" Not nearly as sorry as your mother must be.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 146-3 (Shah b Kallis 23)</strong> Kallis brings himself on, presumably to bowl at his bunny Pietersen, but in fact he cleans up Shah first ball. Shah pushed forward at a length ball but could only inside-edge it back onto timber. Actually, in fairness to Kallis, it was a decent delivery, seaming in enough to take the inside edge.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>26th over: England 150-3 (Pietersen 1, Flintoff 4)</strong> Flintoff gets off the mark with a sublime shot, pinging Kallis through extra-cover for four. As Atherton points out, it's good when he starts an innings by timing the ball, as he did there, rather than trying to belabour it.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>27th over: England 153-3 (Pietersen 3, Flintoff 5)</strong> Serene stuff in that over, as tends to be the case after two quick wickets. The key here is that Pietersen takes as much of Botha as possible, because he could milk a spinner for 90 runs per 100 balls in his sleep. In that over he takes two from two balls against Botha, and Flintoff one from four. You do the math.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 155-4 (Pietersen LBW b Kallis 5)</strong> Kallis really does have Pietersen on a plate. Pietersen tried to whip a big off-cutter through midwicket, missed and was pinned in front. It was hitting, no doubt about that, but it was marginal as to whether he was hit outside the line. I suspect he was hit outside the line. Anyway, Nigel Llong gave it - it certainly looked out live - and Kallis is producing a captain's bowling performance, as nobody ever says because captains are so rarely bowlers.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>28th over: England 157-4 (Flintoff 5, Collingwood 2)</strong> Collingwood, back from his ban, jabs his first ball through midwicket for two. Kallis has figures of 2-0-8-2.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>29th over: England 158-4 (Flintoff 6, Collingwood 2)</strong> Botha will look to hustle through overs for three or four a pop now, or even better: just one from that over to Flintoff. It's such a blow to lose Pietersen when Botha still has six overs in the bank.</p> <p>\"So... still think it was a good time for Belly Boy to get out?\" says Chris Blunt, in a smug manner that in no way makes one wonder what rhyming slang might be used to give him an appropriate nickname.</p> <p>I jest. </p> <p>I just used the word 'one', didn't I?</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>30th over: England 160-4 (Flintoff 7, Collingwood 3)</strong> Flintoff always likes to play himself for 20 balls or so, and that's what's happening the noo. England's Manhattan is ski-sloping, if that's isn't the most absurd thing anyone has ever written, ever.</p> <p>Anyone there? My inbox hasn't seen any hot action for <em>ages</em>.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>31st over: England 165-4 (Flintoff 10, Collingwood 5)</strong> Flintoff, on the walk, manages to squeeze Botha past square-leg for a couple in an other that brings England an acceptable five. </p> <p>Okay, okay, definitely the last link: this one is to Dileep Premachandran's<br><a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/29/crickets_champions_trophy_fall.html\">excellent blog</a> on the Champions Trophy fall-out. Okay so I haven't read it as I'm doing this, but with Dileep it's a fair assumption.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>32nd over: England 167-4 (Flintoff 10, Collingwood 8)</strong> More irritatingly effective fare from Kallis, possibly the most loathed great player of all time (a bit harshly, I feel). Three from it; not two, as previously advertised.</p> <p>\"Does anyone out there know of an iPhone application for OBO coverage?\" asks Alwyn Frank. \"It would make my life a lot easier.\" I'm out there - as the crotchless leather chaps/dungarees combo I'm sporting today would confirm - but I have no idea. You rich people crease me up. I'm still trying to get it on the Spectrum.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>33rd over: England 172-4 (Flintoff 12, Collingwood 10)</strong> This is good from Botha, statistically anyway. I'm quite useless at appraising modest spinners - Patel and Mike Yardy, for example, look to me like men who should be going for 90 a pop - but it's hard to argue with what he's done so far: 7-0-24-1. The Hawkeye graphic shows that his off-stump line is very, very consistent.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>34th over: England 181-4 (Flintoff 17, Collingwood 14)</strong> Flintoff drives Kallis over mid-on for four, the first since the 26th over. Collingwood adds another, charging Kallis and dumping him disdainfully over midwicket. Top shot.</p> <p>\"I bought a new bat yesterday,\" says Alan White, drawing at 0% of readers to the edge of their seat, \"...and without wishing to give free sponsorship, I thought it was the one used by Marcus Trescothick, my favourite player. Imagine my horror when I discovered it was actually endorsed on the maker's website by, er, Steve Harmison. Oh, and Ryan Sidebottom apparently. Do any of your readers have a bat with a less impressive 'face'?\" Insert your own joke here.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 182-5 (Collingwood c Boucher b Botha 14)</strong> The tamest of dismissals. Collingwood pushed almost absent-mindedly at a delivery on leg stump, and it plopped onto the pad and up in the air for Boucher to take a simple catch. Collingwood looked cheesed off, and replays weren't conclusive as to whether he hit it, but there were two noises and it just felt out.</p> <p>That's the bad news. The good news is that Samit Patel is about to play his first innings for England. This boy can bat, I'm here to tell you.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>35th over: England 184-5 (Flintoff 18, Patel 1)</strong> Gregg Roughley, my designated gimp for the day, has just served the most ridiculously strong cup of coffee, so if I start talking utter nonsense (insert your own etc) you know who to blame.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>36th over: England 187-5 (Flintoff 20, Patel 2)</strong> Ntini is back with the harder replacement ball, but I didn't see that over as I trying to put together a link to our county blog, which I have failed to do as I am an html-illiterate <em>gugootz</em>. Anyway, you can get it here: http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/29/county_cricket_live_53.html. Sorry.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>37th over: England 196-5 (Flintoff 26, Patel 4)</strong> Flintoff turns a modest over into a good one by carting a full toss from Botha through wide mid-on for four. Eight from the over.</p> <p>In other news, here's a remarkable little burst of vitriol for a Friday afternoon from Ian Palmer. \"Collingwood fails again because his place is not on the line. SURPRISE SURPRISE.\"</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>38th over: England 202-5 (Flintoff 32, Patel 5)</strong> Four more to Flintoff, who charges Ntini and flays him through the covers. Despite that little mid-innings wobble, England are still in a good position and should get around 280 here.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>39th over: England 207-5 (Flintoff 34, Patel 6)</strong> Morne Morkel is back and nearly puts Patel on his appreciable backside with a very good bouncer. \"In response to Alan White, my bat is made by a company that sponsors Cheshire CCC and the Spanish national side,\" says Craig Woodhouse. \"That's surely less impressive?\"</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>40th over: England 217-5 (Flintoff 38, Patel 13)</strong> Stale Steyn (6-0-34-0) replaces Ntini (7-1-57-0), and Flintoff is lucky to get away with a clunked pull that just looped safely over midwicket for two. Then Patel plays a charming, wristy pull behind square for four, his first boundary in international cricket. Ten from the over.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>41st over: England 220-5 (Flintoff 39, Patel 14)</strong> Morkel beats Flintoff for pace, thudding a bouncer into his helmet. A number of batsmen have been done for pace on the bouncer today, which will bode well for when England bowl. Flintoff is definitely rattled, and is walking across with a fuzzy head as the physio treats him with, er, Red Bull. He'll be fine. He's a big boy.</p> <p>Someone send me an email. Please.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>42nd over: England 227-5 (Flintoff 44, Patel 16)</strong> Patel has looked fine so far, taking as many singles as possible in preparation for the final assault. He's very fidgety about the crease, although that did Michael Slater no harm.</p> <p>Back at the ranch, Flintoff times Steyn over de Villiers at backward point for four. It's hard not to get very excited about the way he's batting in this series. <em>Very</em> excited.</p> <p>Apparently some overs are missing: if so, sorry for that and wotnot. I am typing of all them, but we are having genuine rather than euphemistic technical problems today. </p> <p>\"Sic Transit Gloria: England's Innings,\" says Alex Netherton, who may or may not have spent the last 44 days in a darkened room watching Rushmore on loop.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>43rd over: England 238-5 (Flintoff 49, Patel 22)</strong> Kallis replaces Steyn, and Patel inside-edges his first ball to fine leg for four. Whoop whoop! A single brings up the fifty partnership at more than a run a ball - that's an excellent effort, given that there had to be an element of consolidation in their work. Flintoff celebrates by charging Kallis and thwacking a short one behind backward point for four.</p> <p>\"My bat has a very impressive face,\" says Tom Paternoster. \"Unfortunately the edges are all battered. Sorry.\" You come to my door and you offer me <em>this</em>?</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>44th over: England 246-5 (Flintoff 52, Patel 28)</strong> Consecutive fifties for Flintoff. This one has been a nice, controlled effort, from 56 balls and with six fours. Platforms don't come much better. </p> <p>From the next ball Patel gives himself room and belabours Ntini through mid-off for four. Shot! Eight from the over, and England should be looking for 300 now.</p> <p>\"I'd be interested to know whether or not you feel that Pietersen's remarkably camp walk/mince has become any more exaggerated since his elevation to Captaincy,\" says Matthew Swann. \"It can surely only be a matter of time before he skips onto the field a la Larry Grayson.\" That wouldn't be the only Grayson-related farce seen in an England cricket match this century, eh?</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>45th over: England 253-5 (Flintoff 57, Patel 31)</strong> Flintoff screams Kallis down the ground for four in another decent over for England: nine from it. But, as Gary Naylor points out, India chased over 300 here last year so assumptions of hegemony are dangerous.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 256-6 (Patel b Ntini 31)</strong> The end of an encouraging little innings from Patel, who gave himself room and lost his off stump.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>46th over: England 258-6 (Flintoff 59, Wright 1)</strong> Luke Wright could do with a few runs to prove that he deserves his place above Mascarenhas. </p> <p>Anyway, here's Chris Milner. \"In Paul Doyle's MBM t'other day the first 25 minutes were missed due to an 'almighty technicological palaver'. Given the regularity of these incidents, i'm wondering if GU staff have some kind of dare/betting scheme going on to see who can leave out the most or have the biggest gap in MBM/OBO reports. How far can it go? How long will it be before you claim the GU coputers to have become 'self-aware' and have taken over the office, before going outside for a cig for the entire duration of the match?\" Funnily enough I've never had technical problems before: I was just suffering from booze and made them up. That doesn't happen anymore. But they changed the system recently and I believe there have been a few teething problems. Either that or everyone here is a raging alcoholic, each hiding hipflasks under the desk and enjoying a quick snort every time they tie their shoelaces. I'll let you decide.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>47th over: England 263-6 (Flintoff 61, Wright 4)</strong> Luke Wright slugs Morkel not far over midwicket for a couple. I think Wright, like the excellent Stewart Downing, gets undeserved criticism because of his manager's background. </p> <p>\"Are you going to be doing an OBO for the run on Sunday?\" says Lynn Bashforth. \"Or an Ouch By Ouch as Richard O'Hagan suggests.\" Not <em>all</em> of us have a Blackberry, darling. Can you get wi-fi on a Spectrum?</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>48th over: England 275-6 (Flintoff 72, Wright 5)</strong> Flintoff slams Steyn's first ball square on the off side for four. Steyn replies well, conceding only two runs from the next four balls, but Flintoff finishes the over in style by carting a slower ball over midwicket for six.</p> <p> \"Having not seen much of Samit Patel, is there enough encouragement from his batting and bowling so far to suggest he might be more than just a Michael Yardy clone?\" asks Kevin Wilson. \"The halcyon days of Yardy and Dalrymple in the same team!\" I'd say his bowling is no better, but as batsmen they're incomparable. Patel has a lot of class. We didn't really see it today, except for that pull, as he just played sensibly in the situation. The worry is whether he'd good enough to be the main spinner. I doubt it, but then that shouldn't be his role: he's a batsman who bowls.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>49th over: England 291-6 (Flintoff 76, Wright 15)</strong> Sixteen from the over, and England still have a chance of reaching 300. It starts with a brilliant shot from Luke Wright. Having made room, he stretched way outside off stump to slash a full toss from Morne Morkel over the off side, and got four with the aid of some blundering in the field from Ntini. Then, after a wide, Wright spanks a short ball over midwicket for four more. </p> <p>After he takes a single, Flintoff joins in with a splendid stroke. He walked across his stumps, so Morkel bounced him. Instead of doing what Brian Close would have done - chested it down like a centre back - Flintoff simply swiveled to dump the ball over short fine leg for a one-bounce four.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 295-7 (Wright c Gibbs b Steyn 17)</strong> Wright clunks the penultimate ball to midwicket, and England need six off the last ball to reach 300.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>50th over: England 296-7 (Flintoff 78, Broad 0)</strong> Sky miss the final ball, because of an advert about strap ons or some such. Anyway, it's a leg bye and that makes it a good final over for South Africa: five from it. Flintoff ends unbeaten on 78, from 77 balls. It was a really good, mature knock, especially as a flurry of wickets fell near the start of his innings.</p> <p>England will be pretty happy with their work, particularly as things were looking iffy at 182 for five in the 35th. I'd say the game is about 60/40 in their favour. Join me in half an hour to find out.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>See you in a bit, yeah?</strong></p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>1st over: South Africa 1-0 (target: 297; Amla 1, Gibbs 0)</strong> Here we go. Amla is playing only his fourth ODI - the others were against Bangladesh - and opening for the first time.</p> <p>Already you can hear Prior screaming like a fanzine seller: \"Jimmy Anderson's day today - come on boys!\" Well if Anderson wasn't pumped before, he surely will be now. It's a decent first over, with a bit of swing and one that beat Gibbs's outside edge; one from it.</p> <p>Cook is on for Flintoff, who was clearly shaken when Morkel pinned him with a bouncer. Apparently he won't be off for long; he's just watching the end of Diagnosis: Murder.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>2nd over: South Africa 2-0 (target: 297; Amla 2, Gibbs 0)</strong> A quiet start, this. Here, incidentally, is a <br><a href=\"http://www.thewisdencricketer.com/blog/?p=157\">blog I wrote earlier</a> on why England should have a fluid batting order. It's not very good, but if you read that'll stop you thinking about the mess your life has become for at least 30 seconds, so it's a good deal really.</p> <p>\"We're going to lose, aren't we?\" asks Clare Davies. No, no we're not. \"We\" are going to win by 77 runs, and then \"we\" are going to go and get royally reduced on booze!</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>3rd over: South Africa 4-0 (target: 297; Amla 2, Gibbs 1)</strong> A lucky escape for Amla, who chipped Anderson towards mid-on, but the ball died just short of Harmison. This is a good start from England. Anderson in particular has dragged his length back to the short side of full, and they're struggling to get him away.</p> <p>\"After living here for five years, I've been granted residency from the Home Office,\" says Erik Pedersen, like it's a good thing. \"To celebrate my newfound Englishness \u2013 or at the very least, the sort of pseudo-Britishness that means I'm no longer required to go through the Shifty Foreign Types queue at Heathrow \u2013 I've got tickets for Lord's on Sunday. As the day's meant to be Erik's Big Orgy of Englishness, I was wondering if there's anything in particular that I should do or see at Lord's to wring every last drop of Englishness out of proceedings. While we're at it, if there's anything outside of the cricket that I should be doing, that would also be appreciated.\" Hating yourself would be a <em>big</em> start.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>4th over: South Africa 7-0 (target: 297; Amla 4, Gibbs 1)</strong><br>Stuart Broad, who is fourth in the official ODI bowling rankings (above Murali and McCague), continues to Amla, who it's fair to say isn't the most natural one-day opener. Broad has a biggish shout for LBW but there was doubt on height and also whether it was sliding down. Just dribs and drabs so far. The body language of South Africa's openers reminds me of Nicolas Anelka's as he wandered up to the penalty area in Moscow on May 21.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>5th over: South Africa 10-0 (target: 297; Amla 4, Gibbs 5)</strong> Three from that Anderson over, and so far South Africa haven't played a shot in ang- saying which, Amla fresh-airs a loose hook shot. In other, probably more important news, I've just opened my Lucozade Alert: Lemon Zing, and the mother has sprayed everywhere. Wah! My poor Lucozade Alert: Lemon Zing!</p> <p>\"Marmite sandwiches, pickled onion Monster Munch and Wagon Wheels,<br>washed down with warm - warm dammit - beer,\" offers Wayne Stubbs, in reference to over three.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>6th over: South Africa 18-0 (target: 297; Amla 5, Gibbs 12)</strong> Next ball, Gibbs survives a brutally tight referral to the third umpire. He was quite casual when it came to getting his bat in and, after a direct hit from Patel, it was almost impossible to tell if he was in. It was a split-frame job and, while on balance you suspect he was out, it could not have been given with a clear conscience. Next ball, Gibbs creams Broad through the covers for the first boundary of the innings. </p> <p>\"Erik in the third over could try changing his surname from Pedersen to Pietersen,\" says Fraser Nock, who might consider a bit of moniker-alteration himself.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 19-1 (Gibbs c Shah b Anderson 12)</strong> Gibbs has definitely gone this time. He was driven on to the back foot by Anderson and could only push it firmly to Shah at short cover. That's a really big wicket for England, because Gibbs is the only loose cannon in this top six.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>7th over: South Africa 21-1 (target: 297; Amla 7, Kallis 1)</strong> England will cruise this. South Africa don't want to know.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>8th over: South Africa 30-1 (target: 297; Amla 16, Kallis 1)</strong> Amla finally locates the boundary, fizzing a short one from Broad classily behind square on the off side. Then he goes across his stumps to rubber-wrist one to fine leg for four more. Really good shot.</p> <p>\"I agree with you about fluid batting,\" says Julian Bamford. \"When skipper myself I liked Nos 4,5 &amp; 6 padded up after the first wicket went down. Another country will 'invent' this idea and three years later we will start to use it.\"</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>9th over: South Africa 31-1 (target: 297; Amla 17, Kallis 1)</strong> This is all strangely subdued at the moment, although that will suit England. Just one from Anderson's over and the required rate is up to 6.5 now. Both bowlers have again hit 90mph, by the way.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>10th over: South Africa 34-1 (target: 297; Amla 20, Kallis 1)</strong> <br>England haven't bowled especially well here - Broad in particular has been quite loose - but the South Africans' timing in particular is way off. </p> <p>\"Job done,\" says Jonny Sultoon. \"Keep these two Tavare clones together at the crease and the final score will read 192-1 (Kallis 76*, Amla 91*). Definitely a case of 'dropped catches win matches'.\"</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>11th over: South Africa 35-1 (target: 297; Amla 21, Kallis 1)</strong> Anderson continues to Amla, WHO COULD LEARN A THING OR TWO ABOUT OPENING THE BATTING IN ONE-DAY CRICKET FROM IAN BELL, EH? For the most part it's more strokeless nonsense. Something will have to give soon, because the required rate is ticking up towards seven now. Amla has 21 from 38 balls, Kallis 1 from 12. Excellent stuff from Anderson, who has one for 11 from six.</p> <p>\"Surely,\" says Andy Bradshaw, \"Eric should now be complaining about how the country's gone down the pan and how he is thinking about emigrating somewhere much better where the weather's good and young people are shot on sight.\"</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>12th over: South Africa 40-1 (target: 297; Amla 25, Kallis 2)</strong> Amla is going a long way across to Broad, and that enables him to work one through midwicket for three. But for the most part, South Africa's timing is absolutely shocking here. They look like one-legged men trying to play musical chairs. I'd be inclined to get Flintoff on now to really ram home this advantage.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>13th over: South Africa 47-1 (target: 297; Amla 30, Kallis 3)</strong> <br>That's more like it from Amla, who gets a straighter, fuller delivery from Anderson and sends it spinning through midwicket for four.</p> <p>\"Hello Smyth,\" says Alison Rivett. \"Erik should get into the 'Rnglish' 'spirit' at the cricket by whiling away the 45 minutes until the Oval bars open again by finishing off his warm Lambrini he's smuggled in. Well, that's what we're doing...\". Lambrini. Lam<em>bri</em>ni.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>14th over: South Africa 58-1 (target: 297; Amla 37, Kallis 3)</strong> Harmison replaces Broad, and almost gets Amla in his first over. Amla played a deliberate uppercut, but it bounced only a couple of yards from Jimmy Anderson, running round, before going for four. Then Amla gets four in more orthodox circumstances, driving Harmison pleasantly through the covers. Eleven from the over. Who invited this tool back into the team?</p> <p>\"Apart from the weather, Andy Bradshaw's vision of foreign shores (over 11) sounds a bit too much like Moss Side for my liking,\" honks Matthew Kilsby. Isn't the native tongue easier to understand overseas? HONK!</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>15th over: South Africa 67-1 (target: 297; Amla 46, Kallis 3)</strong> Suddenly the runs are flowing. Flintoff, on for Anderson, sees his first two balls disappear for four: the first an uppercut from Amla, the second a classy flick over square leg.</p> <p>And yes, I did have the individual scores wrong earlier in the innings.</p> <p>\"Eric should probably start indulging in meaningless adoration of 80s celebrities,\" says Alex Netherton. \"<em>Hilarious</em>.\" Not as funny as that Uncle Albert from Only Fools &amp; Horses though? With the beard? Got a picture of him on my wall!</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 67-2 (Amla c Prior b Harmison 46)</strong> Amla goes. He was starting to play really well, but perhaps he got carried away because he had a big flail at Harmison. He didn't get hold of it, however, and it flew off the inside-edge for Prior to take a good, tumbling catch.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>16th over: South Africa 67-2 (target: 297; Kallis 3, de Villiers 0)</strong> A wicket maiden for Harmison.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>17th over: South Africa 70-2 (target: 297; Kallis 3, de Villiers 1)</strong> Phwoar, that's a peach. Flintoff gets a legcutter to lift past the outside edge of the new batsman de Villiers, and Pietersen brings in a slip as a result.</p> <p>\"Is there anything sweeter in cricket for the opposition than seeing Jacques 'must protect my average' Kallis at the crease?\" asks Andy Bradshaw before, to save us the trouble, answering his own question. \"I suppose Ian Bell coming out when England are 35 for two chasing 450.\" In a Twenty20 game. That's been reduced by rain.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>18th over: South Africa 76-2 (target: 297; Kallis 9, de Villiers 6)</strong> Kallis is having a nightmare. It's the captain's logjam. He couldn't middle it with a tank, and inside edges Harmison for one. He has nine from 24 balls. Good shot from de Villiers, though, sweet-spotting a full delivery from Harmison through the covers for four.</p> <p>\"Take that hat off, you utter tool,\" emails Scott Murray, bathing in serotonin on the other side of the office.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 77-3 (Kallis c Patel b Flintoff 9)</strong> A truly rancid innings of 9 from 25 balls comes to an end. Kallis tried to pull Flintoff but, as with every other delivery in this innings, he didn't time it. It looped over midwicket, and Patel running back judged an awkward catch quite splendidly. It's hard to imagine a great player could play quite as badly as Kallis did then.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>19th over: South Africa 78-3 (target: 297; de Villiers 8, Duminy 0)</strong> The required rate is above seven now. \"Many thanks to all those willing to help a simple, swarthy immigrant,\" says Erik Pedersen, for some reason describing himself in a way that makes him sound like an extra in a bongo movie. \"I've now got my checklist for Sunday. At the moment I'm packing my backpack \u2013 the Lambrini's right next to the Wagon Wheel and the warm, warm polypint of Old Badger Worrier nut-brown ale. I'm also acquiring a Jimmy Saville T-shirt and a profound sense of self-loathing disguised as disaffected wit. I will have to demure on the suggestion to declare all this to be rubbish and head off for some place warm and gunfire-oriented as I'm originally from Florida and therefore the move would be somewhat circular.\"</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>20th over: South Africa 79-3 (target: 297; de Villiers 9, Duminy 0)</strong> Harmison keeps the boot on South Africa's throat with a really good over to de Villiers, from which there's just a single.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 82-4 (de Villiers run out 12)</strong> This is miserable cricket. De Villiers, South Africa's last proper batsman, is run out by such a distance that it doesn't even go to the third umpire. He took on a stupid second run to Steve Harmison at fine leg, and a fast, flat throw to Matt Prior did the rest. That was serious nonsense.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>21st over: South Africa 83-4 (target: 297; Duminy 0, Boucher 1)</strong> An enormous amount of thanks to Brigit &amp; Simon, who have given a fantastic amount in support of <a href=\" http://www.justgiving.com/wimbledonlordsspoons\">Sunday's charity run</a>. Thank you.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>22nd over: South Africa 86-4 (target: 297; Duminy 2, Boucher 2)</strong> South Africa really are a complete shower. I have sympathy for them, because they invested an incredible amount emotionally in that Test series and you should never have the one-dayers last for that reason.</p> <p>Only three from Harmison's over, and South Africa will need snookers soon.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>23rd over: South Africa 91-4 (target: 297; Duminy 3, Boucher 6)</strong> England are putting the squeeze on here, with five from Flintoff's over.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>24th over: South Africa 93-4 (target: 297; Duminy 4, Boucher 8)</strong> Interesting decision for Pietersen as to how long he keeps these two going, and when to bring on the spinner. They've had six (Harmison) and five (Flintoff), so I'd give them at two more, maybe three, because by then the required rate should be prohibitive. And if they get another wicket it really is over.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>25th over: South Africa 93-4 (target: 297; Duminy 4, Boucher 8)</strong> Pietersen brings Patel on for Flintoff (5-0-22-1); the logic is presumably that he can hurry through three or four overs before Duminy and Boucher decide it's time to really go for it. That's one out the way: a maiden to Duminy. South Africa need eight an over now.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>26th over: South Africa 99-4 (target: 297; Duminy 6, Boucher 8)</strong> It's a double change, with Collingwood replacing Harmison, who bowled really well for figures of 6-1-23-1. He very nearly strikes first ball when Boucher plays round his pad and misses, but it was just going down and Simon Taufel's survey said \"ERR-ERR\".</p> <p>Later in the over he slides a slower off-cutter through Boucher, but somehow it goes <em>this</em> far over middle stump and beats Prior on its way for four byes. Six from the over, and South Africa are just gently and peacefully going to sleep, like a dying man who can't bring himself to fight anymore.</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>27th over: South Africa 101-4 (target: 297; Duminy 6, Boucher 9)</strong> Boucher, pushing with hard hands, almost give a return catch to Patel, who then has an LBW shout turned down: with the angle from around the wicket, it was comfortably going down the leg side.</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>28th over: South Africa 106-4 (target: 297; Duminy 8, Boucher 12)</strong> South Africa are going without a fight, or even a threatening-gesture-to-show-they're-hard-which-in-reality-they-have-no-intention-of-backing-up. Their batting is almost solemn.</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 114-5 (Boucher b Patel 19)</strong> Well done Samit Patel. Boucher tried to go after him, so Patel quelled his threat the best way - by getting rid of him. It was a quicker ball that zipped through as Boucher made room; very similar to Gibbs's dismissal by the same man a week ago.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>29th over: South Africa 114-5 (target: 297; Duminy 9, A Morkel 0)</strong> That was the last ball of the over and, surely England have won this.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>30th over: South Africa 118-5 (target: 297; Duminy 10, A Morkel 2)</strong> Collingwood goes up for LBW against Duminy, but I think it pitched just a fraction outside leg. What I think is of absolutely no relevance whatsoever, of course, but Simon Taufel thought the same. \"This SA batting performance is the cricket equivalent of the final days of Earl Partridge in Magnolia, only without the Frank TJ Mackey interludes for the sake of entertainment,\" says pop culture's Lee Calvert, drop-kicking some dogs to make the point.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>31st over: South Africa 118-5 (target: 297; Duminy 10, A Morkel 2)</strong> \"Do you know there are South Africans following the cricket on your website?\" says Walter Barnes. \"I'd expect commentary and not snotty comments like the ones you are posting at the moment. It's annoying as well. I really hope SA wins this ODI and make you eat your words. One by one.\" Do people actually eat words? Anyway, all I've done is state facts! With an healthy dose of opinion!</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>32nd over: South Africa 122-5 (target: 297; Duminy 12, A Morkel 4)</strong> Five from Collingwood's over. There really is nothing more to say: it's all just ones and twos, and now they need nearly 10 an over. There's a weird acceptance of defeat.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 134-6 (Morkel c and b Patel 16)</strong> Excellent stuff from Patel. He'd been nailed for two enormous sixes in three balls by Morkel, but he kept his nerve, flighted the next one just enough, and when Morkel screwed it back to him Patel took a really sharp low catch to his right. That was a really good test for Patel, because the two sixes he went for were monsters, and he passed it excellently.</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>33rd over: South Africa 135-6 (target: 297; Duminy 12, Botha 1)</strong> Anyone out there?</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 142-7 (Duminy c Prior b Flintoff 18)</strong> Flintoff back for Collingwood, which is a nice, aggressive move in the circumstances. And there's the desired result: Flintoff switches to around the wicket, and Duminy snicks one through to Prior. This is a rout.</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>34th over: South Africa 142-7 (target: 297; Botha 2, M Morkel 0)</strong> Let's hope England can finish this off in a hurry: it's Friday evening and GU sport are having their post-Olympic drinks. Having contributed absolutely nothing, I feel my attendance is important.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>35th over: South Africa 146-7 (target: 297; Botha 4, M Morkel 2)</strong> \"I've said it before when England get tonked, so it bears repeating<br>when the boot is on the other foot: one-sided 50-over cricket is just<br>painful,\" says Indo Neggy. \"There are nearly 20 overs left and little point to any of them. That's the way this game works and that's part of why Twenty20 has<br>more popularity overall.\" Thing is, so are one-sided Twenty20 games. But not for more than 20 overs; that much is true.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>36th over: South Africa 150-7 (target: 297; Botha 5, M Morkel 4)</strong> England were 4-1 this morning to win the series 5-0. Why didn't I have some of that?</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>37th over: South Africa 158-7 (target: 297; Botha 11, M Morkel 6)</strong> Harmison makes a bit of a comedy Horlicks of an admittedly difficult diving chance at fine leg after Botha top-edged a pull off Patel. \"I still think we'll lose,\" says Clare Davies, who is probably still concerned that she'll be miscarried. It's okay Clare; you're alive!</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>38th over: South Africa 159-7 (target: 297; Botha 12, M Morkel 6)</strong> Harmison on for Flintoff, and there's only one from the over. England really are absolutely hammering South Africa here. This four-pronged seam attack has a ruthlessness that reminds me of the Saffers in the mid-90s, when they had Donald second-change.</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 160-8 (Morkel c Broad b Patel 6)</strong> Morkel lifts Patel miles in the air and down to long-on, where Stuart Broad takes a straightforward catch.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>39th over: South Africa 161-8 (target: 297; Botha 15, Steyn 0)</strong> It's been a very good day for Patel: he batted nicely and now has three wickets.</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>40th over: South Africa 164-8 (target: 297; Botha 16, Steyn 1)</strong> Watching tailenders bat out the overs in a lost one-dayer is a peculiarly painful experience. Would it be so wrong for them to declare? Would it?</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>41st over: South Africa 169-8 (target: 297; Botha 17, Steyn 4)</strong> Sky reckon that, if England win this series, they go second in the official ODI table, having started the series in sixth. That would put them above South Africa, who themselves would have gone top above Australia had they won the series 4-1. Small world.</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>42nd over: South Africa 170-8 (target: 297; Botha 17, Steyn 5)</strong> Just one from that Harmison over. There is startlingly little of note to report.</p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 170-9 (Botha b Patel 17)</strong> Botha is bowled, via the middle of his bat and then the inside of his left leg, and Patel has his fourth wicket.</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 170 all out (Ntini c Prior b Patel 0). ENGLAND WIN BY 126 RUNS AND WIN THE SERIES</strong></p> <p>It's all over, and what a story for Patel, who has Ntini caught behind to take the first ODI five-for by an England spinner since Ashley Giles in 2001-02. </p> <p>More importantly, England have hammered South Africa by 126 runs to take an unassailable 3-0 lead in the series. South Africa are exhausted, but nonetheless it's been genuinely impressive stuff. I'm off to toast English cricket's new dawn. Thanks for all your emails, Rob.</p>",
  "<p><br>The first thing that strikes you when you unbox <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayTV\">PlayTV</a>, Sony's digital TV add-on for the PS3, is how cheap it feels. We're talking light, plasticky and generally underwhelming with none of the shiny machismo of the PS3.<br><strong>Sony have just called to confirm that you CAN actually record while playing games. There will be a message in the final build of the code that will ask you to reboot your PS3 to enable the background recording functionality. This rather important bit of info was missing from the review build I have been using! Lovely. I'll have a look over the next few days and see what, if any, impact recording has when playing a game but clearly this makes PlayTV are far more interesting proposition.</strong> </p> <p>Ok, given the news that you can actually now record while playing - even though my \"review\" kit didn't make this clear - I've amended my review and will add in some more impressions next week once I've tested how gameplay is affected by recording.</p> <p>So potentially good news about the record/play but the PSP transfer is still a shame. Simple transfer to the PSP was seemingly dropped at the last minute - the manual I got with the review copy suggests you can easily transfer TV content onto your PSP. Ouch. Yes, you can transfer content over but it involves a fiddly conversion process - familiar to owners of Freeview PVRs like the Humax 9200 - and is not something that the majority of owners will probably bother with. The better news is that remote play worked well. Watching your recordings or live TV when on holiday is perfectly do-able though the quality depends on your net connection. Also it depends on what you are watching - last night's Uefa Cup football, for example, was too pixellated to appreciate.</p> <p>The good news is that PlayTV is easy to setup and use. Simply plug in your aerial, connect to the PS3 via USB (no additional power supply needed) and switch on the console. After a quick software update and channel search you get \"TV\" added to your <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_Media_Bar\">XMB</a>. Click on PlayTV and you get taken to an intuitive home screen with menus that allow you to watch live TV, check out your recordings and access the EPG. This is all pretty self explanatory and easy to use, although a remote, rather than a pad, is recommended.</p> <p>And for basic use the PlayTV is fine. Recording, scheduling and pausing live TV will feel like a revelation to those used to a basic Freeview box. Unfortunately you can't record two programmes at once - you can record one channel and watch Live TV on another though - which feels a little restrictive. Also, annoyingly, you seem to need to have PlayTV connected to actually watch your recordings.</p> <p>It's hard to see who PlayTV is aimed at. Gadget fan early adopters are likely to have Sky + or a Freeview PVR. Maybe it would work better on a second TV though you need a fixed aerial unless you have super strong Freeview signal. The lack of quick PSP transfer is a blow but could it be outweighed by the ability to record TV and play at the same time? I'll let you know next week.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337065388\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1760479111_gdn-int-080829-cb-US-Obama-Speech-4x3.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Denver is a very nice city, but it doesn't remotely have the transportation infrastructure to handle this week's onslaught. So, as my wife and I left Invesco Field after Barack Obama's speech, the only choice was the usual one \u2013 to walk \u2013 and the only place to go was across a bridge that thousands and thousands of people were funneling into from many directions and despite the presence of various fences and barricades and jersey walls.</p> <p>It was a nightmare, and under other circumstances (particularly ones where they served beer, which they did not Thursday night), distemper and impatience and testy rhetoric and maybe even a fight or two would've ensued. But this night all was calm. People were patient and cooperative. An African American woman walking in front of us carrying two small American flags turned to us to remark on this. </p> <p>I use this as metaphor for the speech because I thought, while it was not one of those rhetorical barnburners for which the candidate is famous, it accomplished something else, more subtle but maybe more profound. Obama made his speech not about him but about his audience. He gave away some of his power this night and gave it to the people (sure enough, \"Power to the People,\" John Lennon's somewhat unfortunate radical-chic anthem from 1971, was among the background music piped into the stadium before Obama spoke).</p> <p>This to me was the single most important thing about the speech. There were other important aspects to it, and I'll get to those, but the main victory Thursday night was that he successfully made the night not about him in a way that could feed into the Celebrity/Messiah/The One/He Who Makes the Clouds Part narrative that the McCain camp has so successfully deployed.</p> <p>The concerns that the speech-event would feed that narrative were palpable. You know \u2013 this was all about his endless ego and so on. There's no denying the man has an ego, but the worst fears of Obama partisans were not confirmed. He said explicitly at one point, \"What the naysayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me. It's been about you.\" The non-verbal presentation worked as well. The stage set as initially described, a Roman temple of some sort, seemed horrifying and an awful choice sure to feed GOP themes. But in reality it turned out to be fine. It more resembled the Rose Garden portico of the White House than any place where Caligula hosted bacchanals. And anyway it didn't appear that any columns showed on television at all. </p> <p>I haven't watched any TV coverage as I write these words but it's my strong bet that they're not talking any Messiah nonsense. And if the speakers at next week's GOP convention will try to poke fun at the speech on those grounds, they'll get laughs in the hall, but I will bet that the jokes won't resonate outside the pews of the already-believing. The speech was more workmanlike than that. And workmanlike was just what was called for under the circumstances. </p> <p>He talked a lot about the economy. He did not \u2013 the speech's one failing, to my ear \u2013 have a short and strong bumper-sticker phrase describing the guiding philosophy of his economic plan. But after this speech, anyone who highly and mightily demands that Obama produce specifics will merely be showing his ignorance and laziness. He also focused on his empathy for working people's concerns. </p> <p>And speaking directly before him were six or seven regular Americans who'd been hit hard by the Bush economy. Each was fantastic, especially Barney Smith, an Indiana factory worker and lifelong Republican who is disgusted with his party and voting for Obama. </p> <p>It was Smith, not the silver-tongued one, who (surely by design \u2013 another way the night was not about Obama) got off the single most memorable line of the evening: \"We need a president who puts Barney Smith before Smith Barney.\"</p> <p>He took on John McCain in a tough and tonally just right way. He accurately painted McCain as a joke of an intellect on economic questions, and (again, subtly, but clearly) on foreign policy, he described a sort of crazy person whose experience has not given him superior judgment at all. Among the three of them, Obama, Bill Clinton and Joe Biden made a sharp case against a McCain presidency.</p> <p>Obama also addressed questions about his resume and experience, albeit indirectly. But he dealt with the questions about his preparedness and seriousness less with words than with demeanor. He did not look like a guy Thursday night whom Putin could push around and did not sound like a guy who couldn't run the army (about 15 generals also took the stage to endorse him).</p> <p>It was just the right speech for the occasion. He did not aggrandize himself. He explained the seriousness of the task at hand in a way that did not send his shock troops over the moon in Messiah ecstasy. Rather, he equipped them with battle armor \u2013 and with determined serenity about what they had to do until November 4.</p> <p>And that was why everyone behaved in such an orderly way as they exited through a veritable obstacle course. They're armed. They were given agency Thursday night, not made into abject Barack-o-maniacs. And that, for a campaign that's banking on winning this election on the strength of thousands of volunteers, may have been the most important thing, more important even than how the media received it.</p>",
  "<p>Four Baloch prisoners have been <a href=\"http://www.ahrchk.net/ua/mainfile.php/2008/2980/\">burned alive</a> in hot coal tar by the Pakistan army during military operations in annexed and occupied Balochistan, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission (<a href=\"http://www.ahrchk.net\">AHRC</a>). </p> <p>Last week the AHRC received confirmation that Pakistani soldiers arrested four people on April 5 2008, in the Dera Bugti district of Balochistan, and subjected them to torture. They were asked to identify local supporters of the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA). After failing to get any names from them, the victims were immersed in scolding hot coal tar. Three of the men were literally boiled and burned to death. A fourth died later from his injuries. </p> <p>Villagers in the area also claim the Pakistan army used a form of chemical gas against them and that some of the gassed survivors were later shot. Their bodies have not been handed over to relatives for burial. </p> <p>These and many other crimes against humanity are still happening in Balochistan, despite the resignation of the dictator President, Pervez Musharraf, and despite Pakistan's ostensible transition to democratic government.</p> <p>During July and August, over 100 Baloch persons were killed, 250 disappeared and more than 20,000 were displaced. They are victims of intensified military operations by the Pakistan army, which has occupied Balochistan since <a href=\"http://commentisfree.theguardian.com/peter_tatchell/2008/04/pakistans_neocolonial_rule.html\">invading in 1948</a> and forcibly incorporating it into Pakistan. </p> <p>Cobra attack helicopters that were <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/pakarms.pdf\"> provided (pdf)</a> by the US to help defeat the Taliban and al-Qaida are instead being used to crush the Baloch people. </p> <p>On May 1 this year, the new democratically elected prime minister of Pakistan, Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani, publicly apologised for the persecution of the Baloch people and pledged to halt military assaults in Balochistan:</p> <blockquote> <p>It has been decided that no army action will be carried out in the province (of Balochistan) until a strategy is formulated in consultation with representatives of the provincial government to deal with the issue of law and order in the province.</p> </blockquote> <p>Contradicting these assurances, Pakistan's war of aggression seems to be intensifying. The Daily Jang newspaper reported on August 21 that the armed forces of Pakistan had deployed more troops in the region, killing innocent civilians in repeated aerial bombardments. </p> <p>Pakistan's minister of the interior visited the area on August 20 and announced that military operations would continue if Baloch nationalists and freedom fighters continued to be supported and protected by the people. The same newspaper also reported on August 24, that military operations have been expanded to new areas in Balochistan. </p> <p>Over the last few years of Pakistani attacks on Balochistan, the AHRC reports that about 3,000 people have died, around 200,000 have been displaced, and more than 4,000 people have been arrested by the police, army and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).</p> <p>The AHRC is organising an urgent action appeal to the government of Pakistan, calling on it to investigate the killing of civilians and to halt military operations in Balochistan.

  "<p>Standing in front of a set designed to replicate the Lincoln Memorial, before which Martin Luther King stood 45 years ago to deliver his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/28/uselections2008.constitutionandcivilliberties\">\"I have a dream\"</a> speech, Barack Obama forcefully, directly and passionately <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.democrats20082\">set forth his practical vision</a> for a new America. </p> <p>Although Obama's reference to Dr King \u2013 \"the preacher from Georgia\" - was somewhat brief, the historical nature of this event was not lost. In 1963, 45 years ago, when Dr King envisioned an America that he never lived to see, America was a segregated nation. Many African Americans lived in desperate conditions with few rights: unable to vote, forced to attend inferior schools and live separately and highly unequally from white Americans. Someone like Barack Obama was merely a vision, an idea that existed in Dr King's head. </p> <p>There is no doubt that Dr King would have been proud as Barack Obama stood on the stage at Denver's Invesco Stadium, and so eloquently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.barackobama2\">set out his case</a> for why he \u2013 the first African American presidential nominee to lead a major political party in America - would be the best choice as the next American president. As <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/2008-democratic-national-convention-remarks/story.aspx?guid=%7B85F4EDD3-9579-4F62-B553-4E109CACDA6B%7D&amp;dist=hppr\">Martin Luther King III told the convention</a> earlier on Thursday, his father would be \"proud of Barack Obama, proud of the party that nominated him and proud of the America that will elect him\" before saying that Dr King \"is in the hopes and dreams, the competence and courage, the rightness and readiness of Barack Obama.\"</p> <p>In 1963, African Americans were struggling at the hands of a society that enforced injustice and discrimination on the basis that they were not fit to partake on an equal basis in American life. Yesterday, however, Obama stood tall as not just an African-American man but as an all-American man; a man who was able to receive his education at Harvard and Columbia rather than a historically black college, an inferior institution or no college at all. He emphasized that he is a man who shares the same values and love for his country as any other American and while he did so, tens of thousands of non-African Americans listened, agreed and supported him. </p> <p>While things are far from perfect in America when it comes to issues of race, Barack Obama attempted to show us that he can bring to life the ideals that Dr King believed in, not only as a civil rights leader for black people but as a leader of American people as a whole. </p> <p>In Denver yesterday, Obama took his opponent John McCain straight on and directly hit back at every attack that has been made on him. Sarcastically making comments such as \"John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.\", Obama used his well-crafted and executed speech to address the issues of his celebrity status, patriotism, his apparent lack of experience and his background. </p> <p>He challenged those who have criticised him for his lofty rhetoric by bringing things back to earth, winding his ideology of change and hope around an everyday, practical explanation of exactly what that means. \"Let me spell out exactly what that change would mean as president,\" he said before going on to provide solid figures, setting out his policies on economics, healthcare, energy, Iraq and education - and telling us how exactly they would work and be implemented. He certainly looked and sounded every inch the president. </p> <p>What's important now is whether or not his speech will have an impact on those who were unsure about him. Even though Obama attempted to provide a middle way in his speech, it's likely that his positions on gun crime, abortion and gay marriage may still alienate some voters while others may still believe that while he gave a great speech, his policies still do not resonate with them. </p> <p>As Obama delivered his speech, I reflected on the fact that no matter what happens on November 4, history has already been made on a number of levels. Record numbers of African Americans and young voters have been drawn back into political life. African Americans made up a record <a href=\"http://www.demconvention.com/assets/downloads/Delegate-Diversity-1984-2008.pdf\">24% of the Democratic convention delegates</a> this year while the youngest delegate was just 17. Around $400m has been donated by ordinary American citizens who have been galvanized by the internet and other forms of new media.</p> <p>Ten years ago, when Jesse Jackson had his name placed in the Democratic nomination roll call, his chances of getting to where Obama is today were slim. But in only four years \u2013 since that now famous 2004 convention speech - Barack Obama has risen from a virtual unknown to presidential nominee. It's quite possible that next year we'll see a black family in the White House, a place that was built by African American slaves.</p> <p>Few African-Americans believed that they would see this day in their lifetime. Yet, thanks to Dr King's vision and Obama's attempt to realise that vision, African Americans can now believe that they might one day be able to run for president. In less than five decades they have gone from having their voting rights abused to feeling <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/images/PollingUnit/1068a4BlacksandObama.pdf\">they have a chance</a> to sit in the highest seat of office in the country, while many white Americans now feel ready to support a black presidential candidate. Obama still has work to do if he is to widen the gap between himself and McCain. But if his speech in Denver wasn't a sign of great progress, what is?</p>",
  "<p>One of the greatest gifts of our democracy is the opportunity it offers us every four years to change course. It's not a guarantee; it's only an opportunity. The question facing us is, simply put, will we seize this opportunity for change? That's why I came here tonight: to tell you why I feel so strongly that we must seize this opportunity to elect Barack Obama president of the United States.</p> <p>Eight years ago, some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didn't really matter who became president. Our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity. Some assumed we would continue both, no matter the outcome. But here we all are in 2008, and I doubt anyone would argue now that election didn't matter.</p> <p>Take it from me, if it had ended differently, we would not be bogged down in Iraq, we would have pursued bin Laden until we captured him. We would not be facing a self-inflicted economic crisis; we would be fighting for middle-income families. We would not be showing contempt for the Constitution; we'd be protecting the rights of every American regardless of race, religion, disability, gender or sexual orientation. And we would not be denying the climate crisis; we'd be solving it.</p> <p>Today, we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000, though it may be even more obvious now, because John McCain, a man who has earned our respect on many levels, is now openly endorsing the policies of the Bush-Cheney White House and promising to actually continue them. The same policies all over again?</p> <p>Hey, I believe in recycling, but that's ridiculous. With John McCain's support, President Bush and Vice-President Cheney have led our nation into one calamity after another because of their indifference to fact; their readiness to sacrifice the long term to the short term, subordinate the general good to the benefit of the few and short-circuit the rule of law.</p> <p>If you like the Bush-Cheney approach, John McCain's your man. If you want change, then vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden.</p> <p>Barack Obama is telling us exactly what he will do: launch a bold new economic plan to restore America's greatness; fight for smarter government that trusts the market, but protects us against its excesses; enact policies that are pro-choice, pro-education and pro-family, establish a foreign policy that is smart as well as strong; provide healthcare for all and solutions for the climate crisis.</p> <p>So why is this election so close? Well, I know something about close elections, so let me offer you my opinion. I believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change Barack Obama represents.</p> <p>There is no better example than the climate crisis. As I have said for many years throughout this land, we're borrowing money from China to buy oil from the Persian Gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilisation. Every bit of that has to change. Oil company profits have soared to record levels, gasoline prices have gone through the roof and we are more dependent than ever on dirty and dangerous fossil fuels.</p> <p>Many scientists predict that the entire north polar ice cap may be completely gone during summer months in the first term of the next president. Sea levels are rising, fires are raging, storms are stronger. Military experts warn us our national security is threatened by massive waves of climate refugees destabilizing countries around the world, and scientists tell us the very web of life is endangered by unprecedented extinctions.</p> <p>We are facing a planetary emergency which, if not solved, would exceed anything we've ever experienced in the history of humankind. In spite of John McCain's past record of open-mindedness on the climate crisis, he has apparently now allowed his party to browbeat him into abandoning his support of mandatory caps on global warming pollution.</p> <p>And it just so happens that the climate crisis is intertwined with the other two great challenges facing our nation: reviving our economy and strengthening our national security. The solutions to all three require us to end our dependence on carbon-based fuels.</p> <p>Instead of letting lobbyists and polluters control our destiny, we need to invest in American innovation. Almost 100 years ago, Thomas Edison said, \"I'd put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power! I hope we don't have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that.\" We already have everything we need to use the sun, the wind, geothermal power, conservation and efficiency to solve the climate crisis - everything, that is, except a president who inspires us to believe: \"Yes we can.\"</p> <p>So how did this no-brainer become a brain-twister? Because the carbon fuels industry - big oil and coal - have a 50-year lease on the Republican party and they are drilling it for everything it's worth. And this same industry has spent a half a billion dollars this year alone trying to convince the public they are actually solving the problem, when they are in fact making it worse every single day.</p> <p>This administration and the special interests who control it lock, stock and barrel after barrel, have performed this same sleight-of-hand on issue after issue. Some of the best marketers have the worst products; and this is certainly true of today's Republican party. The party itself has on its rolls men and women of great quality. But the last eight years demonstrate that the special interests who have come to control the Republican party are so powerful that serving them and serving the national wellbeing are now irreconcilable choices.</p> <p>So what can we do about it? We can carry Barack Obama's message of hope and change to every family in America. And pledge that we will be there for Barack Obama - not only in the heat of this election, but in the aftermath as we put his agenda to work for our country.</p> <p>We can tell Republicans and Independents, as well as Democrats, why our nation needs a change from the approach of Bush, Cheney and McCain. After they wrecked our economy, it is time for a change. After they abandoned the search for the terrorists who attacked us and redeployed the troops to invade a nation that did not attack us, it's time for a change. After they abandoned the American principle first laid down by general George Washington, when he prohibited the torture of captives because it would bring, in his words, \"shame, disgrace and ruin\" to our nation, it's time for a change.</p> <p>When as many as three supreme court justices could be appointed in the first term of the next president, and John McCain promises to appoint more Scalias and Thomases and end a woman's right to choose, it's time for a change.</p> <p>Many people have been waiting for some sign that our country is ready for such change. How will we know when it's beginning to take hold? I think we might recognise it as a sign of such change, if we saw millions of young people getting involved for the first time in the political process. This election is actually not close at all among younger voters - you are responding in unprecedented numbers to Barack Obama's message of change and hope.</p> <p>You recognise that he represents a clean break from the politics of partisanship and bitter division. You understand that the politics of the past are exhausted, and you're tired of appeals based on fear. You know that America is capable of better than what you have seen in recent years. You are hungry for a new politics based on bipartisan respect for the ageless principles embodied in the United States Constitution.</p> <p>There are times in the history of our nation when our very way of life depends upon awakening to the challenge of a present danger, shaking off complacency to rise, clear-eyed and alert, to the necessity of embracing change.</p> <p>A century and a half ago, when America faced our greatest trial, the end of one era gave way to the birth of another. The candidate who emerged victorious in that election is now regarded by most historians as our greatest president. Before he entered the White House, Abraham Lincoln's experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in Springfield, Illinois, and one term in Congress - during which he showed the courage and wisdom to oppose the invasion of another country that was popular when it started but later condemned by history.</p> <p>The experience Lincoln's supporters valued most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse. He was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator, with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land. He insisted on reaching past partisan and regional divides to exalt our common humanity. In 2008, once again, we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning. And once again, we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition.</p> <p>Barack Obama had the experience and wisdom to oppose a popular war based on faulty premises. His leadership experience has given him a unique capacity to inspire hope, in the promise of the American dream of a boundless future. His experience has also given him genuine respect for different views and humility, in the face of complex realities that cannot be squeezed into the narrow compartments of ideology. His experience has taught him something that career politicians often overlook: that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance.</p> <p>The extraordinary strength of his personal character - and that of his wonderful wife, Michelle - is grounded in the strengths of the American community. His vision and his voice represent the best of America. His life experience embodies the essence of our motto - e pluribus unum - out of many, one. That is the linking identity at the other end of all the hyphens that pervade our modern political culture. It is that common American identity \u2013 which Barack Obama exemplifies, heart and soul - that enables us as Americans to speak with moral authority to all of the peoples of the world, to inspire hope that we as human beings can transcend our limitations and to redeem the promise of human freedom.</p> <p>Late this evening, our convention will end with a benediction. As we bow in reverence, remember the words of the old proverb: \"when you pray, move your feet.\" Then let us leave here tonight and take the message of hope from Denver to every corner of our land, and do everything we can to serve our nation, our world - and most importantly, our children and their future - by electing Barack Obama President of the United States.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337065388\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1760479111_gdn-int-080829-cb-US-Obama-Speech-4x3.flv\"/> </video>   <p>To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation;</p> <p>With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.</p> <p>Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours - Hillary Rodham Clinton. To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next vice-president of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you. I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.</p> <p>To the love of my life, our next first lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia - I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you.</p> <p>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.</p> <p>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generationcan pursue their dreams as well.</p> <p>That's why I stand here tonight. Because for 232 years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors - found the courage to keep it alive.</p> <p>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil and the American promise has been threatened once more.</p> <p>Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less. More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet. More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay and tuition that's beyond your reach.</p> <p>These challenges are not all of government's making. But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W Bush.</p> <p>America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this.</p> <p>This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work.</p> <p>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for 20 years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.</p> <p>We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes.</p> <p>Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough! This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive. Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight. On November 4th, we must stand up and say: \"Eight is enough.\"</p> <p>Now let there be no doubt. The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect. And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need.</p> <p>But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush 90% of the time. Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than 90% of the time? I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a 10% chance on change.</p> <p>The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on healthcare and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent. He said that our economy has made \"great progress\" under this president. He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong. And when one of his chief advisers - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a \"mental recession,\" and that we've become, and I quote, \"a nation of whiners\".</p> <p>A nation of whiners? Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made. Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty. These are not whiners. They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint. These are the Americans that I know.</p> <p>Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans. I just think he doesn't know. Why else would he define middle class as someone making under $5m a year? How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans? How else could he offer a healthcare plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatise social security and gamble your retirement?</p> <p>It's not because John McCain doesn't care. It's because John McCain doesn't get it.</p> <p>For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else. In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is - you're on your own. Out of work? Tough luck. No healthcare? The market will fix it. Born into poverty? Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots. You're on your own.</p> <p>Well it's time for them to own their failure. It's time for us to change America.</p> <p>You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.</p> <p>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma. We measure progress in the 23m new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was president - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.</p> <p>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work.</p> <p>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.</p> <p>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.</p> <p>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.</p> <p>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the south side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.</p> <p>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman. She's the one who taught me about hard work. She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life. She poured everything she had into me. And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well.</p> <p>I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. These are my heroes. Theirs are the stories that shaped me. And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the United States.</p> <p>What is that promise?</p> <p>It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.</p> <p>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road.</p> <p>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology.</p> <p>Our government should work for us, not against us. It should help us, not hurt us. It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work.</p> <p>That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.</p> <p>That's the promise we need to keep. That's the change we need right now. So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am president.</p> <p>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it.</p> <p>Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.</p> <p>I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.</p> <p>I will cut taxes - cut taxes - for 95% of all working families. Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class.</p> <p>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as president: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.</p> <p>Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years, and John McCain has been there for 26 of them. In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels. And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office.</p> <p>Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution. Not even close.</p> <p>As president, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power. I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America. I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars. And I'll invest $150bn dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and 5m new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.</p> <p>America, now is not the time for small plans.</p> <p>Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy. Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education. And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance. I'll invest in early childhood education. I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support. And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability. And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.</p> <p>Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible healthcare for every single American. If you have healthcare, my plan will lower your premiums. If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves. And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most.</p> <p>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.</p> <p>Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect social security for future generations.</p> <p>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.</p> <p>Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow. But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet 21st-century challenges with a 20th-century bureaucracy.</p> <p>And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money. It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F Kennedy called our \"intellectual and moral strength\". Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient. Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair. But we must also admit that programmes alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.</p> <p>Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of America's promise.</p> <p>And just as we keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad. If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next commander-in-chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.</p> <p>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face. When John McCain said we could just \"muddle through\" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights. John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.</p> <p>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79bn surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.</p> <p>That's not the judgment we need. That won't keep America safe. We need a president who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past.</p> <p>You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying Iraq. You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington. You can't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances. If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need.</p> <p>We are the party of Roosevelt. We are the party of Kennedy. So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country. Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe. The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans - Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.</p> <p>As commander-in-chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.</p> <p>I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan. I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts. But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression. I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease. And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future.</p> <p>These are the policies I will pursue. And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain.</p> <p>But what I will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes. Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.</p> <p>The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook. So let us agree that patriotism has no party. I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain. The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag. They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of America.</p> <p>So I've got news for you, John McCain. We all put our country first.</p> <p>America, our work will not be easy. The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past. For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits. What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose. And that's what we have to restore.</p> <p>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country. The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the second amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals. I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination. Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers. This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.</p> <p>I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk. They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values. And that's to be expected. Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters. If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.</p> <p>You make a big election about small things.</p> <p>And you know what - it's worked before. Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government. When Washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty. If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know.</p> <p>I get it. I realise that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office. I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington.</p> <p>But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring. What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me. It's been about you.</p> <p>For 18 long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past. You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result. You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington. Change comes to Washington. Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.</p> <p>America, this is one of those moments.</p> <p>I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming. Because I've seen it. Because I've lived it. I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided healthcare to more children and moved more families from welfare to work. I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.</p> <p>And I've seen it in this campaign. In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time. In the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did. I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbours who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise.</p> <p>This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich. We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong. Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores.</p> <p>Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.</p> <p>That promise is our greatest inheritance. It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.</p> <p>And it is that promise that 45 years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in Washington, before Lincoln's memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.</p> <p>The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things. They could've heard words of anger and discord. They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred.</p> <p>But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and colour, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked. That together, our dreams can be one.</p> <p>\"We cannot walk alone,\" the preacher cried. \"And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back.\"</p> <p>America, we cannot turn back. Not with so much work to be done. Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for. Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save. Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend. America, we cannot turn back. We cannot walk alone. At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future. Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.</p> <p>Thank you, God bless you and God bless the United States of America.</p>",

  "<p>[I'm liveblogging tonight's events <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.barackobama\">here</a>.]</p> <p>[I've replaced the excerpts that were here previously with the full advance text]</p> <p>To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation;</p> <p>With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.</p> <p>.</p> <p>Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton. To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you. I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.</p> <p>To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you.</p> <p>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.</p> <p>It is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.</p> <p>That's why I stand here tonight. Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive.</p> <p>We meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more.</p> <p>Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less. More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet. More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach.</p> <p>These challenges are not all of government's making. But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W. Bush.</p> <p>America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this.</p> <p>This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work.</p> <p>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.</p> <p>We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes.</p> <p>Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land enough! This moment this election is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive. Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight. On November 4th, we must stand up and say: \"Eight is enough.\"</p> <p>Now let there be no doubt. The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect. And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need.</p> <p>But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time. Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time? I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change.</p> <p>The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives on health care and education and the economy Senator McCain has been anything but independent. He said that our economy has made \"great progress\" under this President. He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong. And when one of his chief advisors the man who wrote his economic plan was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a \"mental recession,\" and that we've become, and I quote, \"a nation of whiners.\"</p> <p>A nation of whiners? Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made. Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty. These are not whiners. They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint. These are the Americans that I know.</p> <p>Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans. I just think he doesn't know. Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a year? How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans? How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement?</p> <p>It's not because John McCain doesn't care. It's because John McCain doesn't get it.</p> <p>For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else. In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is you're on your own. Out of work? Tough luck. No health care? The market will fix it. Born into poverty? Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you don't have boots. You're on your own.</p> <p>Well it's time for them to own their failure. It's time for us to change America.</p> <p>You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.</p> <p>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma. We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.</p> <p>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work.</p> <p>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.</p> <p>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.</p> <p>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.</p> <p>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.</p> <p>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman. She's the one who taught me about hard work. She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life. She poured everything she had into me. And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well.</p> <p>I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. These are my heroes. Theirs are the stories that shaped me. And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States.</p> <p>What is that promise?</p> <p>It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.</p> <p>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road.</p> <p>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology.</p> <p>Our government should work for us, not against us. It should help us, not hurt us. It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work.</p> <p>That's the promise of America the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.</p> <p>That's the promise we need to keep. That's the change we need right now. So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President.</p> <p>.</p> <p>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it.</p> <p>Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.</p> <p>I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.</p> <p>I will cut taxes cut taxes for 95% of all working families. Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class.</p> <p>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.</p> <p>Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them. In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels. And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office.</p> <p>Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution. Not even close.</p> <p>As President, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power. I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America. I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars. And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.</p> <p>America, now is not the time for small plans.</p> <p>Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy. Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education. And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance. I'll invest in early childhood education. I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support. And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability. And we will keep our promise to every young American if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.</p> <p>Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American. If you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums. If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves. And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most.</p> <p>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.</p> <p>Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations.</p> <p>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.</p> <p>Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow. But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.</p> <p>And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money. It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F. Kennedy called our \"intellectual and moral strength.\" Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient. Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair. But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.</p> <p>Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility that's the essence of America's promise.</p> <p>And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad. If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.</p> <p>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face. When John McCain said we could just \"muddle through\" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights. John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.</p> <p>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.</p> <p>That's not the judgment we need. That won't keep America safe. We need a President who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past.</p> <p>You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq. You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington. You can't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances. If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice but it is not the change we need.</p> <p>We are the party of Roosevelt. We are the party of Kennedy. So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country. Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe. The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.</p> <p>As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.</p> <p>I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts. But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression. I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease. And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future.</p> <p>These are the policies I will pursue. And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain.</p> <p>But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes. Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.</p> <p>The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook. So let us agree that patriotism has no party. I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain. The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag. They have not served a Red America or a Blue America they have served the United States of America.</p> <p>So I've got news for you, John McCain. We all put our country first.</p> <p>America, our work will not be easy. The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past. For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits. What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose our sense of higher purpose. And that's what we have to restore.</p> <p>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country. The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals. I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination. Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers. This too is part of America's promise the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.</p> <p>I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk. They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values. And that's to be expected. Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters. If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.</p> <p>You make a big election about small things.</p> <p>And you know what it's worked before. Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government. When Washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty. If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know.</p> <p>I get it. I realize that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office. I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington.</p> <p>But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring. What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me. It's been about you.</p> <p>For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past. You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result. You have shown what history teaches us that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington. Change comes to Washington. Change happens because the American people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.</p> <p>America, this is one of those moments.</p> <p>I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming. Because I've seen it. Because I've lived it. I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work. I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.</p> <p>And I've seen it in this campaign. In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time. In the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did. I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise.</p> <p>This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich. We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong. Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores.</p> <p>Instead, it is that American spirit that American promise that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.</p> <p>That promise is our greatest inheritance. It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.</p> <p>And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.</p> <p>The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things. They could've heard words of anger and discord. They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred.</p> <p>But what the people heard instead people of every creed and color, from every walk of life is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked. That together, our dreams can be one.</p> <p>\"We cannot walk alone,\" the preacher cried. \"And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back.\"</p> <p>America, we cannot turn back. Not with so much work to be done. Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for. Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save. Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend. America, we cannot turn back. We cannot walk alone. At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future. Let us keep that promise that American promise and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.</p> <p>Thank you, God Bless you, and God Bless the United States of America.</p> <p>[<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.barackobama\">Go back</a> to the liveblog]</p>",
  "<p><strong>DENVER</strong> \u2014 There isn't really any other way to say it: to step out into the main arena here at Invesco Field, where Barack Obama will soon accept the Democratic nomination as the first black presidential candidate of a major American political party, is to taste history in the making, in the air. The stadium hasn't yet nearly reached its capacity of 75,000, but already, the emotion hits you in waves when you step into the crowd; almost everyone seems on the brink of tears. (A delegate from Kentucky just stopped me to ask directions to the hamburger stand; within two more sentences \u2014 all I did was ask her how she was finding the occasion so far \u2014 her eyes were glistening.) We've already heard from the daughter and eldest son of Martin Luther King, in two highly moving speeches; Stevie Wonder and Al Gore are due on any minute. You can consider tonight's liveblog officially started, but the key hour begins at <strong>8pm Denver time</strong> (<strong>10pm eastern, 3am UK time</strong> \u2014 coffee, people, coffee!): join me for what can't really help but be an extraordinary night.</p> <p><strong>6.46pm:</strong> Actually, Stevie Wonder's been and gone, to a rapturous reception. Here's Al Gore, with a nice line: \"Today, we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000, though it may be even more obvious now, because John McCain, a man who has earned our respect on many levels, is now openly endorsing the policies of the Bush-Cheney White House and promising to actually continue them. The same policies, all over again? Hey, I believe in recycling, but that's ridiculous.\"</p> <p><strong>6.57pm:</strong> In a risky line, addressing the \"experience\" criticism of Obama, Gore notes that Abraham Lincoln, \"now regarded by most historians as our greatest president,\" had almost exactly the same experience in elective office as Obama: \"Eight years in his state legislature in Springfield, Illinois, and one term in Congress.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337056955\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/8/29/1219971979247/crowd1.jpg\" alt=\"crowds\" width=\"458\" height=\"137\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>7.05pm:</strong> Despite all the elation here, the word that Obama's campaign aides have been using to describe the speech we can expect to hear tonight is 'workmanlike'. In any circumstances, there would be <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/29/us/politics/29stage.html?ref=us&amp;pagewanted=print\">significant political risks</a> involved in staging an event as vast and high-profile as this one. But the Obama campaign planned this historic public nomination acceptance before the McCain campaign started vigorously pushing its \"celebrity\" line in the media, so now it's even more crucial that Obama tries to anchor the occasion with some down-to-earth policy talk. \"I'm not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric,\" he said yesterday. \"I am much more concerned with communicating how I intend to help middle-class families live their lives.\" Given the pitch of emotion here already, keeping this event down-to-earth could be a struggle. But adulatory crowds coupled with workmanlike language from the podium is probably a combination that Team Obama would like just fine.</p> <p><strong>7.11pm:</strong> CNN isn't taking any risks with its headlines: <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/08/28/dnc.day/?iref=mpstoryview\">Obama expected to address change in speech</a>.</p> <p><strong>7.25pm:</strong> An appearance from Joe Biden. Meanwhile, SPOILER ALERT! It would be wrong not to inform you that an advance version of Obama's speech has been released, and is in various places online. I've posted it <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/aug/29/1\">here</a>.</p> <p><strong>7.50pm:</strong> Just back from the floor to my computer. It's crazy out there. We heard from six \"American voices\", including the cannily selected Barney Smith, who got a huge cheer for saying the government should care more about Barney Smith than Smith Barney...</p> <p><strong>8pm:</strong> Illinois senator Dick Durbin is here to introduce Obama. And now a video tribute, in which Obama says he \"probably was shaped more by his [father's] absence than his presence.\"</p> <p><strong>8.05pm:</strong> The updated full advance version of Obama's remarks are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/aug/29/1\">here</a>. </p> <p><strong>8.08pm:</strong> In that other story, no leak yet to disrupt the media coverage of this event, but lots of people <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/211096.php\">seem to think</a> John McCain is about to pick \u2014 or in fact has picked \u2014 Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty.</p> <p><strong>8.11pm:</strong> It's that Barack Obama guy! The applause, by my count, lasts justs under two minutes. Wild.</p> <p><strong>\"With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.\"</strong></p> <p>(Yesterday, he was the official nominee. Today, he's officially officially the nominee. No, like, he's <em>really</em> the nominee now.)</p> <p><strong>8.18pm:</strong> Thanks for Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Joe Biden. \"Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story -- of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to. It is that promise that has always set this country apart -- that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.\"</p> <p><strong>8.20pm:</strong> \"America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this... Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land -- enough!\" He really shouted \"enough\" -- nothing \"conciliatory\" about that at all. The audience here loved hearing it. </p> <p>\"Next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight. On November 4th, we must stand up and say: 'Eight is enough.'\" That's a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Is_Enough\">TV reference</a>.</p> <p><strong>8.27pm:</strong> A reprise of something we've heard a lot in this convention -- a \"more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger\" criticism of John McCain, beginning with the respect that the Obama team know it's wise to pay to his military service and his former maverick ways. \"Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans. I just think he doesn't know. Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a year? How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than 100m Americans?... It's not because John McCain doesn't care. It's because John McCain doesn't get it.\" The focus here is, as many predicted, largely economic, reaching out to the much-focused-on hard-up voters, especially in key swing states.</p> <p>\"Born into poverty? Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots. You're on your own.\" Nice line. A reference to economic prosperity under Bill Clinton gets a big cheer.</p> <p><strong>8.31pm:</strong> A direct hit back on the \"celebrity\" line, after a list of struggling but inspiring Americans, including his own mother: \"I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. These are my heroes. Theirs are the stories that shaped me. And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States.\"</p> <p><strong>8.34pm:</strong> A raft of economic specifics, and then this: \"And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.\"</p> <p>\"I'm on the fourth floor with Sarah Silverman,\" my colleague Richard Adams emails from elsewhere in the stadium, annoyingly.</p> <p><strong>8.42pm:</strong> Just back from the stadium floor, where I arrived in time for a passage on tax and education spending. It was loud out there before. Now it is VERY VERY LOUD indeed. There's also a big, big echo, which makes it hard to hear Obama, though seeing him's no problem, thanks to the gigantic screens.</p> <p><strong>8.44pm:</strong> And on to foreign policy: Obama's opposition to the war... \"John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell -- but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.\" McCain is even more stubborn than Bush on Iraq, he's saying now.</p> <p><strong>8.47pm:</strong> I don't really understand this line, which is clearly an attempt to seize the moral high ground: \"But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes.\" He does, though, doesn't he?</p> <p>\"Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism...\"</p> <p><strong>8.52pm:</strong> AK47s are bad; letting gays and lesbians visit people in hospital is good.</p> <p><strong>8.54pm:</strong> And now the stirring closing passage. \"You have shown what history teaches us -- that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington. Change comes to Washington.\" And up to the crescendo, which is this:</p> <p>\"...It is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream. The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things. They could've heard words of anger and discord. They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred. But what the people heard instead -- people of every creed and color, from every walk of life -- is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked. That together, our dreams can be one. 'We cannot walk alone,' the preacher cried. 'And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back.' America, we cannot turn back. Not with so much work to be done. Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for. Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save. Not with so many families to protect, and so many lives to mend. America, we cannot turn back. We cannot walk alone. At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future. Let us keep that promise -- that American promise -- and in the words of Scripture, hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\"</p> <p>In accordance with US law, they play him out with <a href=\"http://www.cowboylyrics.com/lyrics/brooks-and-dunn/only-in-america-4920.html\">this horrible country rock song</a>.</p> <p><strong>9pm:</strong> Here's Joe Biden and Michelle and the kids and various others. FIREWORKS! Streamers, and a patriotic rock-orchestral medley. Top marks for the fireworks, no marks for the classical rock.</p> <p><strong>9.15pm:</strong> So how'd it go? Ezra Klein <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=08&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=obama_1\">puts it well</a>: \"This has been the most aggressive speech of the week. And the most substantive I've seen Obama give. It's not a thematic address: It's not about hope or values or the universality of the American experience of the illusory obstacles that divide us. It's concrete. It's about the failure of the Republican Party, and the promises of the Democratic Party.\" </p> <p><strong>9.20pm</strong> Stunningly, the McCain campaign doesn't agree. \"Tonight, Americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of Barack Obama. When the temple comes down, the fireworks end, and the words are over, the facts remain: Senator Obama still has no record of bipartisanship, still opposes offshore drilling, still voted to raise taxes on those making just $42,000 per year, and still voted against funds for American troops in harm's way. The fact remains: Barack Obama is still not ready to be President.\" But they would say that. </p> <p>Then again, after all the hype about a McCain attack ad that was going to be released tonight, we get <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.johnmccain\">this</a>: \"Too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed. But I wanted to stop and say congratulations \u2026 tomorrow we'll be back at it. But tonight, senator [Obama], job well done...\"</p> <p>...There was almost nothing more on Hillary Clinton, and plenty on Bush and McCain. (The way Obama shouted \"Enough!\", and some of his other remarks, still seems surprising, given how much we've read about his need to avoid the appearance of anger.) After a convention week devoted in significant part to working through the Democrats' internal issues, it was emphatically faced forward to the coming election battle. It's always more fun to listen to a lofty speech, but there were good reasons that Obama, for the most part, avoided loftiness; this speech's solidity and substance should prepare the party well for the high profile attacks they're going to endure all next week. And ultimately, of course, the fact of this speech \u2014 who was delivering it, and where \u2014 was as important as its content. </p> <p>Now all Obama has to do is win the election.</p> <p>====</p> <p>POSTSCRIPT</p> <p>Some immediate responses from the audience...</p> <p>\"I'm numb,\" said Maureen Gallaty, originally from New Orleans, who lost her brother in Hurricane Katrina. \"I teared up, and I'm no a cryer. The symbolism of him being here \u2014 it's like the whole Kennedy era came back, and now we have the same spirit as president Jack Kennedy, as Martin Luther King, alive and well... it gives me chills to say those words.\"</p> <p>\"No Democrat could be displeased with it,\" said Barbara Diffay, from Tuskegee, Alabama, who spent the last few days volunteering for the convention \u2014 shepherding people in and out of the Pepsi Center \u2014 in return for a ticket. \"He said everything that he needed to say.\"</p> <p>\"It was an enormous risk to do this,\" Jonathan Starr, a Hawaii delegate, told my colleague David Munk. \"And if it hadn't been such a success, it would have looked really bad.\" (Elana Schor has been questioning the crowd in more detail, and in the story she's busy writing now, shortly to be seen <a href=\"http://guardian.co.uk/uselections\">here</a>, she'll report that the attendees she spoke to seemed much more excited by the substance of Obama's speech than the theatrics \u2014 specifically, his tax plans, including the elimination of capital gains taxes for some small businesses, and his promise to \"finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East\" within 10 years.)</p> <p>====</p> <p>Thanks for reading and commenting. Now I've got to try to leave the stadium, which may take a number of hours.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337059033\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/8/29/1219983774155/theend.jpg\" alt=\"The end\" width=\"459\" height=\"329\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>",
  "<p>Maybe it hardly bears thinking about the morning of November 5 if Barack Obama has lost to John McCain the previous day. And it may seem perverse to think about it at all on a day like today, when Obama yet again commands the stage. But let's try to do it, right now, partly because the closeness of the polls suggests a narrow McCain win is a real possibility \u2014 partly because there has been so much underlying nervousness, as well as renewed exhilaration, among Democrats in Denver this week; and partly just out of common political prudence. </p> <p>So, why might McCain win on November 4? I think there are five main reasons to consider. </p> <p>The first is that these remain insecure times. The economic downturn has been very real in the US, in spite of yesterday's good growth figures. America's fear of rising fuel prices remains a potent electoral issue, laced as it now is with the fear that high oil prices are lining the coffers of America's enemies in places such as Russia, Iran and Venezuela. American soldiers are fighting difficult wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. McCain has a big poll lead on national security, foreign policy and ability to deal with a crisis. Every Russian tank rumbling around the Caucasus is harvesting votes for McCain \u2014 and the electorate may prefer to entrust the country to a leader with warrior credentials than take a chance on a visionary neophyte. </p> <p>The second reason why McCain might win is that this election is no longer about George Bush. America in late 2008 has a president who is a member of the political living dead. His name was barely mentioned at the Democratic convention this week. Along with Dick Cheney he will make an early appearance at St Paul on Monday at the Republican convention; after that, he's out of it. And with him may go many of his negatives. That leaves McCain some elbow room to fight the campaign his own way. McCain is a tough campaigner. He is also a smart one. He could do well in the televised debates. Compared with the midterms in 2006, the Democrats may find it hard to make this an election about Bush. </p> <p>Which brings us to reason No 3. American presidential elections are always close these days. Bush beat John Kerry with just 51% of the popular vote in 2004 and was neck-and-neck with Al Gore in 2000. In the electoral college Bush won by 286-251 against Kerry and by 271-266 against Gore. In the past four presidential elections \u2014 even the two that Bill Clinton won \u2014 no Democratic candidate has ever polled more than 49%. Democratic landslides have not been in fashion since 1964. This year's polls \u2014 in which Obama's average lead is now just 1.8% \u2014 are beginning to point to yet another 50:50 election. In these close races discipline, negative campaigning, and get-out-the vote organisation in the battleground states all matter. Over the years these have been Republican strengths, not Democratic ones. </p> <p>Recent polls also point to the fourth piece of good news for McCain: voters may be suffering from Obama fatigue. Obama is still fighting a campaign that is centred on self. His own story, his own vision and his own uniqueness are at the heart of his message. He consciously takes the whole weight of the campaign on his own slim shoulders, as he did again last night by taking his acceptance speech out of the convention hall and into the local football stadium, where he spoke against a backdrop of Greek pillars. Hubris? What if the nation that fell in love with Obama in the first phase of his great campaign decides he is yesterday's rock star as the real election nears. I think Obama is well aware of this \u2014 but voters don't just want big vision and soaring oratory. </p> <p>The final reason is simply Obama's race. The nomination of a black man to be president is not something marginal but something massive. It goes to the heart of whether America's self-identity is genuinely multiracial, or whether , in spite of everything, it is still white. This election isn't just about the possibility of a black president, but the possibility of a black first family. It asks white voters to see themselves embodied and represented by African-Americans, and to vote to be led by black people. This is something bigger than electing a woman leader would be, were that on offer. Race and slavery are America's original sin. The election of Obama would be, beyond question, one of the noblest gestures of historical redemption that Americans have ever been called upon to make. But that is precisely why it may not happen. </p> <p>So if, on January 20 2009, it is McCain, not Obama, who stands in the winter's air on Capitol Hill to be sworn in as Bush's successor, what would that mean for America and the world? The first thing to say is not to exaggerate the domestic or even the international impact; McCain would be the president of an already humbled, not newly triumphalist, conservatism. The economy would dominate his agenda. The next, umbilically linked point is to remember that McCain would have to work with a Congress in which, on the same election day, the Democrats are likely to strengthen their majority in the House of Representatives and secure firm control of the Senate. He could very easily find himself a weak president. </p> <p>Yet there could be no disguising the lessons for the Democrats, who would have lost three winnable presidential contests in a row. If Obama loses, there will not be another African-American nominee for at least a generation. Hillary Clinton might have the consolation that she would become, overnight, the overwhelming favourite to finally win the Democratic nomination in 2012. But who would bet against such a divisive figure not extending the losing streak from three to four? It would begin to look as if the only way of getting a Democrat into the White House would be as the result of an armed uprising. </p> <p>All that would be as nothing to the global dismay that would greet the election of President McCain. Much of the world would simply despair of the American people \u2014 and so would many Americans. Anti-Americanism would have a new recruiting sergeant, and global confi dence in the democratic progressive project would suffer a historic blow. November 5 would be a bonfire night of the liberal vanities. I tend to think it won't happen that way \u2014 but it certainly could. And it may all be just 10 short weeks away.</p>"
