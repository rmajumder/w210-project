  "<p>Interesting developments on the Blu-ray front: it seems that it may have been hacked. That at least is the interpretation that seems (if you look at it sideways and narrow your eyes a bit) to emerge from the discussion on the <a href=\"http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=140571\">Doom9 forum</a>, though if you find the 11-page going too heavy there (\"I have had a look at the difference of the output of dumphd and anydvd for a bd+ movie. Using vbindiff i compared the 00001.m2ts\") you could get the simpler version <a href=\"http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=2908\">via Adrian Kingsley-Hughes</a> at ZDnet:</p> <blockquote> <p>what's happened here is that the researchers have recreated BD+ virtual machine, similar to that which resides inside a normal Blu-ray player. The forum posts are highly technical in nature but fascinating to follow - it's quite amazing to see this mechanism being unraveled over the course of a few weeks</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The real weakness for BD+ has been that Blu-ray works with both hardware and software players. This break, while not easy by any stretch of the imagination, would have been much harder if it had to be carried out on hardware.</p> </blockquote> <p>There's actually a very good encapsulation of the challenge in the Doom9 thread itself: </p> <blockquote> <p>BD+ involves the player running a small virtual machine whenever a BD+ disc is inserted. The virtual machine is a small BD+ content code interpreter that includes 100 lines of code and 60 different instructions. The VM loads additional code from the Blu-ray disc, which can perform one of three functions:</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>- Transform code, which is used to correct sections of video data which are deliberately corrupted on the video stream part of the disc. If hackers strip out only the video code itself, it will display corrupted sections without the application of transform code. This code may also be used to add digital watermarks to certain discs, which can then be used for forensic investigations of leaked copyrighted material.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>- Basic countermeasures, which can check a player that is known to have had its hardware hacked for example, a patch to the drive's firmware and detect and respond to this hack. This allows new discs to disable playback on standalone players that have been hacked, without having to revoke the license keys of the entire model or line of players.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>- Advanced countermeasures, which can load native code that runs directly on the Blu-ray player during the playback process. This code can do any number of things, but is designed to provide additional methods of protection should the basic countermeasures fail.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Once the disc is removed from the player, the virtual machine unloads and is no longer present in memory. This returns the Blu-ray player to its initial state, so that even if a machine fails to play a BD+ title, it should still (again, in theory) play previously-released Blu-ray titles that do not have BD+ protection.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>According to the Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA), for hackers to successfully attack the BD+ system they would have to first extract the AACS keys (which has already been done quite successfully) and then overcome title-specific security code by reverse-engineering the BD+ virtual machine. While this last bit is definitely an additional challenge, it is by no means impossible.</p> </blockquote> <p>Which brings us to the main question. If BD+ has been cracked, is that good or bad for sales of Blu-ray players?</p> <p>Well, first it means that those Blu-ray discs can be pirated. It also means that people can copy their own discs for backup purposes. (Given that the elements on a Blu-ray disc are <a href=\"http://www.cdfreaks.com/reviews/Blu-ray-vs_-HD-DVD/conclusion.html\">down to 138 nanometres</a>, a backup might be nice - what would Marmite fingers do to your precious Blu-ray disc?)</p> <p>But if the discs can be pirated, then they can be sold to people who will have to play them on... Blu-ray players. Not much extra money for the studios (people who buy pirated discs aren't that likely to buy many extra legitimate discs; else why are they buying pirated discs? Give me your links to academic studies refuting this with DVDs, if you can) but arguably plenty of extra money for hardware makers, because you need a Blu-ray player to play them.</p> <p>And there might be a group who at the moment won't buy Blu-ray because they can't make backups. (I'd count myself among them. Though it might be very small. Even just a group of one.) Having a cracked BD+ would actually benefit both the hardware makers and the studios in that case, if that group is large enough.</p> <p>But what do you think? Is it better for Blu-ray if BD+ is cracked, or closed?</p>",
  "<p>Now, finally, the election is upon us. And now there is a chance for a once-in-a-half-century, perhaps even once-in-a-century political realignment. There is a chance to say goodbye to a politics built around tribalism and to move into a new chapter in American history.</p> <p>I'll keep this short. From the civil war onwards, Democrats controlled America's southern states and used their power to enforce a rigid apartheid system. Southern Democrats remained a vital part of any national Democratic coalition, and hence, even under otherwise radical administrations such as those of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, segregation was never seriously challenged. The \"peculiar institution\" of slavery was ended by the Yankee victory in the civil war, but the almost equally peculiar institution of race politics and the division of society into racial castes persisted.</p> <p>For reasons too convoluted to go into here, in the 1960s the national Democratic party embraced civil rights. And as the legal architecture of Jim Crow was dismantled and more African-Americans were registered to vote, reluctantly, at least at first, white southern Democrats began to reach out to these empowered constituents. Eventually African-Americans became a core part of the party's identity.</p> <p>The Republicans sensed an opportunity and began aggressively courting conservative southern whites aggrieved by these changes. And in one of the country's more remarkable transferrals of political allegiance, in the space of a couple electoral cycles Dixie went from being Democrat to being Republican. And it has remained so ever since. </p> <p>A core part of the Republican party's national coalition, in many ways the south has altered the GOP at least as much as the GOP has altered it. Lincoln's party went from being a party of moderate social reform to being almost revolutionary in its right-wing, conservative fervour; from being a party led by east coast Brahmins to being a party of born-again populists. It's the southern Republican party that so stridently pushed economic deregulation; that broke organised labour \u2013 in addition to opposing racial equality, historically southern political elites were notoriously anti-union; that eviscerated the minimum wage; that attempted to shatter church-state boundaries in a myriad of ways. It's the southern-dominated party that made opposition to abortion access a lynchpin wedge issue, and that has tried to do the same in recent years by touting a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. </p> <p>But, always, the centrality of race has remained, sometimes bubbling up to the surface, sometimes partially camouflaged. For decades, the Republican party has played an array of race cards to win and maintain power. In 1968, Nixon won the keys to the White House at least in part because of his appeal to what he later labelled a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_majority\">\"silent majority\"</a>, a conservative bloc of voters hostile to civil rights and eager to conflate black citizens with crime. In 1980, Reagan used images of African-American <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/19/opinion/19krugman.html\">\"welfare queens\"</a> to go after liberal defenders of government social programmes. Eight years later, Bush Sr used the notorious <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC9j6Wfdq3o\">Willie Horton ads</a> - photos of an African-American prisoner who had been furloughed from a Massachusetts prison while Mike Dukakis was governor, and who had then gone on to rape a white woman - to destroy his Democratic opponent. In 2000, Bush defeated McCain in the GOP primaries largely on the back of racially inflammatory <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/17/report-mccain-using-same_n_135699.html\">robocalls in South Carolina</a> insinuating that McCain had illegitimately fathered a black daughter. </p> <p>Eight years on, McCain, now the nominee, has done everything possible to cast aspersions on Obama's Americanness. While colour is never explicitly mentioned, it's the subtext in many of his and Sarah Palin's speeches, as well as in the numerous robocalls that have blitzed residents in southern states over the past two months.</p> <p>In the last few days, Pennsylvania - one of only two Democratic states from the 2004 election thought to be within McCain's reach - has been flooded by television ads once again seeking to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qyh-gGsib0w\">correlate Obama to the inflammatory preacher Jeremiah Wright</a>. Palin supporters have been filmed <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKUovpF9LWU\">holding toy monkeys with Obama signs</a> on them at her rallies. And a miasma of racist rhetoric hangs over much of the campaigning by local Republican party operatives in many southern states. One Georgia representative even <a href=\"http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/westmoreland-calls-obama-uppity-2008-09-04.html\">used the word \"uppity\"</a> in early September to describe the Ivy League-educated Barack and Michelle Obama \u2013 a term almost exclusively used by southern whites to refer to blacks who aren't content with accepting a lowly lot in life.</p> <p>We'll shortly know whether these tactics worked. If they did, it will be a cultural catastrophe. In poll after poll, Obama outperforms McCain on all the key issues: the economy, foreign policy, environmental issues, healthcare plans and so on. Polls show he beat McCain in all three of their face-to-face debates. And, as significantly, several polls that attempted to <a href=\"http://www.crystalair.com/content.php?id=32200809017\">measure the \"likeability\" factor</a> also gave Obama an edge. He's seen as someone more voters would prefer to have beers with, watch football with, be a teacher to their children. In other words, when it comes to both ideas and personality, Obama wins. </p> <p>If democracy is simply a competition of ideas varnished by a sense of personal charm evinced by its lead figures, Obama's the next president. But democracy is more than that. Unfortunately, tribalism has a powerful hold on the process. A significant number of people - despite an unprecedented year-long national conversation about race and culture and American identity - still have a gut-check problem with voting for a black man.</p> <p>If McCain wins, tribalism wins. The southern gamble, that race will always remain central to the nation's political decision-making process, that race will always trump economic common sense, pays off. And the American dream takes a rabbit punch to the kidneys that will take decades to recover from. </p> <p>If Obama wins, however, taking some southern states and bringing enough new voters to the polls that several Senate seats in the region also go blue, then at long last the possibility of a truly post-racial political system comes one enormous step closer to fruition.</p> <p>The stakes couldn't possibly be any higher.</p>",
  "<p>I've been hearing it all over the place: Yes, Barack Obama is up in the polls, but <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Vote2008/story?id=6031233\">will his lead hold</a>? Even though national polls have widened slightly in the final days of the campaign, concerns about the reliability of the polls in predicting the election of our first African-American president won't go away.<br> According to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_effect\">Bradley effect</a> (also known as the Wilder effect), white Americans will exaggerate their willingness to vote for a black when asked by pollsters. The theory is that some whites think that voicing support for the black candidate is more socially acceptable. (Tom Bradley was a former mayor of Los Angeles who narrowly lost the elections for governor of California in 1982 after being ahead in the polls. Doug Wilder was elected governor of Virginia in 1989, though by a narrower margin than predicted.)<br> The concern for Obama supporters is that if the actual vote falls two or three percentage points below some polls, then John McCain could still eke out a victory.</p> <p>But the most thorough analysis of the phenomenon finds that the Bradley effect disappeared more than a decade ago. Daniel Hopkins of Harvard <a href=\"http://people.iq.harvard.edu/%7Edhopkins/wilder13.pdf\">pulled together the data from 133 state-wide elections held between 1989 and 2006</a> (pdf). He found that before 1996 blacks \"performed on average 2.7 percentage points worse than their polling numbers would indicate.\"<br> Since then, however, racially charged issues like welfare and crime have become less important to voters, according to Hopkins: \"In 1995, 12% of Americans cited social welfare issues as the nation's most important problem, a figure that was just 5% by 2001 and 4% in 2004. In 1994, 29% of Americans cited crime as the nation's most important problem, a figure that had dropped to 9% by 2004.\" If so Bill Clinton and Joe Biden may have set the stage for Obama with the passage of welfare reform and crime bills in the 1990s. Biden's 1994 crime bill, which provided funding for 100,000 police in state and local jurisdictions, helped reduce national crime rates and took away the argument that Democrats were soft on crime. \"Law and order\" stopped being a political catch phrase and became instead the name of television's most successful cop show franchise.  The next year, Clinton joined with Republicans in Congress to reform welfare, placing time limits on benefits and requiring that recipients return to work within two years. Gone are the days when Republicans like Ronald Reagan could campaign on welfare queens living off the taxes of hard-working whites. Another reason the Bradley effect has disappeared is that whites are more familiar, and thus more comfortable, with blacks representing them in office. According to the Joint Centre for Political and Economic Studies, blacks are finding increasing success with all voters, not just urban minorities. By 2007, <a href=\"http://www.jointcenter.org/index.php/current_research_and_policy_activities/political_participation/black_elected_officials_roster_introduction_and_overview\">30% of black state legislators</a> served districts with mostly white residents.<br> Obama and his campaign managers <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5h9_GcRuwpbtaVtNPEL7fLTETiMpgD944F0R00\">understand</a> that familiarity breeds consent. The campaign has opened field offices in small towns in states like Virginia, North Carolina and even Arizona. Obama has paid an astonishing <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122549472220189573.html\">48 visits to Indiana</a>, compared to McCain's two stops, which is why that red state is now in play. Political observers who thought Obama was just throwing a head fake by competing in so many red states are now seeing the Democratic candidate threatening to win these states for the first time in a generation.<br> In recent weeks, Republicans have latched on the tax issue, arguing that Obama wants to spread the wealth - as in tax you and give it someone less deserving. While this line may have caught on with Joe the Plumber and his buddies, the political environment is not as conducive to such arguments as it once was. McCain and his allies are furiously trying to paint Obama as too scary to serve as president. But Americans are increasingly comfortable with black candidates in general, and Obama in particular. With polls showing him above 50% for the last several weeks, I don't think voters are going to show a last-minute change of heart when they step in the polling booth.</p>",
  "<p>The above photograph was snapped yesterday afternoon at an Obama rally in Columbus, Ohio, by my brother-in-law, Ron Ungvarsky. It stands to reason that arugula farmers need arugula eaters, no?

  "<p>Iran's nuclear programme has returned to the forefront of the US presidential campaign as John McCain tries desperately to scare voters in Florida and Pennsylvania from choosing Barack Obama. The Democratic candidate would, he says, <a href=\"http://iranvnc.com/en/floater_article/1/5728\">negotiate with Iran</a> over its nuclear programme. The Bush administration has saddled the next president with a bankrupt strategy and a crisis rapidly spinning out of control. Remarkably, there is widespread agreement among foreign policy experts of both parties that changing course and negotiating with Iran early in the next administration is essential to prevent a conflict that could engulf the entire Middle East. The barrage of slime from McCain hides the fact that he has no strategy to resolve the standoff and prevent the coming military confrontation. A vote for John McCain is literally a vote for war with Iran.</p> <p>Whichever candidate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/03/uselections2008-last-campaign-day\">wins tomorrow</a> will inherit a crisis of passive appeasement of Iran's nuclear ambitions. The Bush administration sought an economic stranglehold on Iran through UN sanctions but soaring energy prices wiped out any impact of the weak measures it attained at the security council. It faired no better in its attempts at political isolation, and far from halting Tehran's nuclear drive, the complete failure of the Bush administration's strategy has allowed Iran to accelerate its uranium enrichment programme bringing them much closer to a nuclear capability.</p> <p>Making the task more difficult, the next president will take over during a period of dramatic political transition in the key countries in the conflict. Not only will there be a new administration in Washington, but there will also be a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/28/israel-palestinians-middle-east\">new government in Israel</a> after fresh elections there in February or March and Iran has its own presidential elections in May. Throughout this period, Iranian nuclear scientists will continue to make progress on the uranium enrichment programme. </p> <p>Iran is still likely several years from a nuclear weapon, but that is not the only timeline at work and there is a real urgency to change the dynamic surround their nuclear programme. As Iran's uranium enrichment has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/31/iran-weaponstechnology\">continued unabated</a> during the Bush administration and new concerns emerge about the scope of its nuclear programme, even moderate Israeli officials are growing increasingly worried about Iran reaching a level of nuclear knowledge that is impossible to turn back. That threshold could be reached in little more than a year even though Iran would still be years from a functioning weapon. Unless the current trajectory of the crisis changes dramatically before that window closes, the Israelis may be compelled to act and fighting could spread across the entire region. Whatever one thinks about the merits of such an action, the next American president must do all that he can to prevent it. </p> <p>Negotiating without preconditions is the only pathway to a breakthrough that could prevent an Israeli attack. Requiring that your adversary accede to all of your demands before negotiations can begin is simply an excuse not to negotiate. Barack Obama has pledged that he would drop the ultimatum that Iran suspend its nuclear programme before he would meet with the Iranian leader to conduct negotiations to designed to bring Iran's nuclear development to a halt. This shift would allow senior officials from both countries to engage in preparatory meetings to establish a framework for negotiations and the parameters and likelihood of any agreement. This strategy is no guarantee of success, but Obama knows that America's current strategy is an abject failure and that we need to try something different, and he is not alone.</p> <p>A presidential election campaign is a terrible place to look for consensus across party lines, but that's just what has been happening among foreign and security policy experts of both parties on the question of negotiating with our adversaries. Recently, <a href=\"http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2008/09/16/five-former-us-secretaries-of-state-talk-to-iran/\">five former secretaries of state</a>, three Republicans and two Democrats, endorsed talking with Tehran. So has the defence secretary, Robert Gates. Even the new Centcom commander General David Petraeus said last month that \"you have to talk to your enemies\". </p> <p>The only one left out is John McCain, who bizarrely seems to think that too much presidential diplomacy caused the current impasse. Earlier in the campaign he derisively said of Obama's proposal that \"many believe all we need to do to end the nuclear programmes of hostile governments is to have our presidents sit down with leaders in Pyongyang and Tehran, as if we haven't tried talking to these governments repeatedly over the past two decades\". McCain's latest decent into dishonour warns that nothing less than a <a href=\"http://www.newstin.co.uk/related.a?edition=uk&amp;group_id=en-010-006245768&amp;similarFilter=US\">second holocaust</a> could occur if Obama prevails on Tuesday.</p> <p>All of McCain's incendiary charges hide the fact that, just like his secret plan to kill Osama bin Laden, he has not given any indication what he would do differently from the woefully inadequate efforts of the Bush administration to stop Iran's nuclear programme. After the catastrophe of the Bush administration, we do not have the luxury of repeating the same mistakes. Barack Obama promises the chance of averting disaster. John McCain only promises war.</p>",

  "<p>Democrats are increasingly confident that the US congressional election on Tuesday will see them extend their majority in the House of Representatives and reduce the Republicans in the Senate to an ineffective rump. Polls today suggest that the Democrats stand to take not only the White House, but will win seven or eight more seats in the Senate, where they already hold 51 of the 100 seats.</p> <p>A Congressional victory on that scale would help Barack Obama to avoid the fate of some of his predecessors, whose legislative plans have often been blocked by hostile Republicans.</p> <p>The Democrats, fighting the congressional race with almost as much intensity as the White House battle, poured millions of dollars into the campaign at the weekend. Obama diverted some of his funds into key Senate and House races in places such as Georgia. Democrats in Senate races had spent more than $67m, against $33.7m by the Republican candidates, as of the end of last week.</p> <p>Despite Congress reaching levels of unpopularity that rival that of President George Bush, voters surveyed by pollsters blamed the economic crisis on Republicans, rather than Democrats, who seem likely to hang on to the gains they achieved in the 2006 mid-term elections. The Democrats may fall just short of the 60 Senate seats needed to prevent the Republicans mounting legislation-blocking tactics such as filibustering.</p> <p>Larry Sabato, director of the centre for politics at the University of Virginia, said the Democrats should not become hung up on the 60 figure, and that it would not matter if they failed to reach it. \"The Republicans who are left are going to be irrelevant for the first year of the Obama administration. The Republicans will not have a major role to play,\" he said.</p> <p>He said the concentration on reaching the 60 mark was overdone, because some moderate Republican senators would probably vote with the Democrats, or face trouble being re-elected.</p> <p>Another potential problem facing a Republican rump, according to the political scientists Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal, is that it could be more conservative than the existing Republican Senate group. According to their analysis, the Republicans most at risk of losing their seat are mainly those on the more moderate wing. A more rightwing Senate grouping might find it harder to attract voters from the centre ground in the congressional mid-term elections in 2010.</p> <p>The three Senate seats most likely to switch from the Republicans to the Democrats on Tuesday are Virginia, New Mexico and Colorado. Others the Democrats hope to take include Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Oregon.</p> <p>One of the biggest victims of a Democratic rout in the Senate could be Elizabeth Dole, the conservative senator for North Carolina. Norm Coleman, the Republican incumbent in Minnesota who famously clashed with the British parliamentarian George Galloway at a Senate hearing on Iraq, is facing a close race against the Democratic candidate, the comedian Al Franken.</p> <p>To reach the filibuster-proof 60 seats in the Senate, the Democrats will need to take Georgia, Kentucky or Mississippi. That is mainly why Obama announced last Friday that he would begin advertising in Georgia. The state may prove beyond him, but the big turn-out of African-Americans in the state, attracted by his candidacy, offers an outside chance of a Senate upset.</p> <p>In the races for the House of Representatives, where the Democrats have held control since 2006, the party is expecting to extend its lead by a further 25-plus seats.</p>",
  "<p>Last month, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, the Argentine president, announced the presentation in Congress of a bill to <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7682877.stm\">nationalise private pension funds</a>. The move fuelled fears in global financial markets that Argentina may default on its debt payments, just like it did in 2001.</p> <p>The ensuing arguments in Argentina have, however, focused on two very different aspects: critics of the move decry a greedy and corrupt government eager to put its hands on fresh cash, while the government portrays the move as ideological and aimed at protecting future pensioners and improving social security from the volatility of the financial markets where the funds are invested. Debt payments are hardly mentioned.</p> <p>The 10 privately-owned pension funds \u2013 or AFPJs as they are called in Argentina \u2013 have generated their share of negative publicity for themselves over the years with their low returns and exorbitant commissions. Since their creation in 1994, the funds have saved 96,000 million pesos for retirement accounts while pocketing 36,000 million in administration fees. The ratio of pension contributions to pensions paid also highly favours the funds, which currently have some 3 million contributors but only pay pensions to around 450,000 people. </p> <p>Created in 1994 by the conservative Peronist president Carlos Menem, the private pensions scheme has been widely criticised. Because of this, Kirchner's bill has split the opposition. While the centre-right is infuriated \u2013 in an editorial, the conservative daily La Naci\u00f3n called the move \"<a href=\"http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1061925\">legalised robbery</a>\" \u2013 the centre-left is happy with the bill's core idea (they take issue with the wording but are more than willing to negotiate).</p> <p>This is not the first change to the original scheme. Last year, N\u00e9stor Kirchner, Cristina's husband and predecessor, modified it to allow workers to freely move between the private scheme and the state (previously, this could only be done once, at the start of a person's working life). The overhanging question is why has Cristina Kirchner decided to change a system her husband had already modified.</p> <p>The president has been in office for less than a year and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/30/argentina-kirchner\">has not done well</a>. She has been battered on many fronts, most notably by growing inflation and a months-long battle with farmers over export tariffs that ended in July when the Senate rejected a government-sponsored bill to tax exports of soy and other grains. The congressional defeat was especially painful because it was inflicted not only by the centre-right parties but also by members of the centre-left opposition who are ideologically close to the administration \u2013 like the Socialist and Radical parties \u2013 and, more painfully, by members of Kirchner's own Peronist party.</p> <p>This new bill puts those rebel Peronists and the Socialists and Radicals in an odd position. The rebel Peronists can hardly oppose the proposal because they are part of a self-named \"workers' party\" and the pension scheme change is widely perceived as a win-win situation for workers (the two leading union umbrellas have celebrated the move). Socialists and Radicals have been critical of the private pensions for years and therefore cannot oppose change either. </p> <p>Therefore, the pension bill can also be considered an attempt to win a large-scale political victory that would serve as political redemption for the government and redefine the line between progressive and rightist political camps.</p> <p>Problems surface among supporters of nationalisation when it comes to writing the bill itself, since the government version is extremely ambiguous. Critics, even those who support nationalising the funds like <a href=\"http://artepolitica.com/volver-a-reparto-es-respetar-la-constitucion/\">the opposition lawmaker Mar\u00eda Am\u00e9rica Gonz\u00e1lez</a>, have serious doubts about how pensions funds will be managed and regulated once they fall into government hands. Given the history of political patronage by Argentine governments, many say the funds will be used next year to win votes in the midterm elections.</p> <p>The government says that under state management, pension funds would never be invested in \"intangible\" markets as they are today and would only be used for social security or investments in infrastructure in Argentina (after the bill was presented, the government <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b16ee040-a558-11dd-b4f5-000077b07658.html?nclick_check=1\">ordered AFPJs to repatriate assets invested abroad</a>). To ensure this, several members of the opposition have suggested controls and regulations for the money, such as limiting the use of the funds to social security.</p> <p>With these arguments going on, there is little space for talk of possible debt defaults, mainly because debt payments are due in the second half of 2009, light years away in Argentine political terms. Fiscal gaps are growing, and the government may need reserves to control the exchange rate, but had the administration really been concerned about obtaining cash to control a problematic market, it had other ways to do so. Currently, around 55% of all pension fund assets are Argentine government bonds, which proves that when the government wanted to get funding from AFPJs it knew how to. It could have done the same this time, and it could have also made AFPJs repatriate funds without nationalising them. Instead, it decided to make a political gambit whose results are yet to be seen.</p>",

  "<p>Exactly a year ago President Musharraf of Pakistan, in his capacity as chief of army staff, illegally declared <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/11/03/asia/pakistan.1-164654.php?WT.mc_id=rssfrontpage\">a state of emergency</a> and unceremoniously dumped most of the country's top judges. Nine months later he was forced to step down, and Asif Zardari, husband of former Prime Minister Benezir Bhutto, was subsequently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/06/pakistan1\">elected president</a>. His party \u2013 the Pakistan People's Party \u2013 had pledged to reinstate the deposed judges, but most have still not been restored to their posts. Is there hope for respect for human rights and the rule of law in Pakistan? </p> <p>The declaration of the state of emergency last November was frightening. Musharraf used his new powers under the emergency to summarily dismiss <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/the-statement-by-chief-justice-iftikhar-chaudhry-399166.html\">Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary</a>, and most of the judges of the higher judiciary, and replace them with his own \"yes men\". Hundreds of lawyers and political activists who opposed Musharraf's actions were detained. </p> <p>The supreme court had increasingly been challenging Musharraf's government over the apparent misuse of executive powers. It was about to determine Musharraf's eligibility to contest the October 2007 presidential election while at the same time holding the office of chief of the army. Chaudhary had also taken a tough stance on hundreds of cases of disappearances, and had found against the government in several rulings. When the state of emergency was declared these cases were immediately shelved. Currently hundreds of cases remain pending before the supreme court. </p> <p>There was a brief glimmer of hope after the elections in February. A new coalition government moved quickly to distinguish itself from the old Musharraf regime by expressing its support for human rights. Significantly it signed the <a href=\"http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_cescr.htm\">international covenant on civil and political rights</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html\">UN convention against torture</a>. It also made a public commitment to commute all death sentences, Pakistan has 7,000 people on death row, one of the largest number in the world. But sadly little has since been done since by Pakistan to put its words into effect. </p> <p>A weak and compliant judiciary has eroded the rule of law in Pakistan. The unique ability of an independent judiciary to challenge human rights violations, review abusive laws and provide redress to individuals who have suffered is essential. The new government has given some assurance that it will uphold the independence of the judiciary, but it has not followed through on this commitment yet. </p> <p>What this means in reality is that hundreds of cases of disappearances remain pending. <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=10893\">Amnesty International</a> has documented many of these cases, including that of Masood Janjua, a 45-year-old businessman from Rawalpindi, and his friend Faisal Faraz, 25, an engineer from Lahore. Both were apprehended nearly three years ago (30 July 2005) while travelling on a bus. Security forces have denied holding the men but Mr Janjua's wife Amina has presented the supreme court with an affidavit from five people declaring that her husband has in fact been held at various places of detention \u2013 including an army building called 501 Workshop in Rawalpindi \u2013 by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency. </p> <p>These cases establish a pattern of security or other forces arbitrarily detaining people, blindfolding them, and moving them around numerous detention centres so they become almost impossible to trace. This is what Chaudhary and others were trying to address. </p> <p>This is a critical time for the new government of Pakistan. After a year of great uncertainty, there is an opportunity now to make a clear pledge to respect for human rights and the rule of law, starting with measures which uphold the independence of the judiciary and limit the President's authority in appointing judges. </p> <p>For its part, the international community, including the British government, can tell Zardari that it expects such assurances \u2013 including, critically, the upholding of the judiciary's independence \u2013 as an indication that the country has drawn a line under the events that began on November 3 2007. </p>",
  "<p>Lawyers acting for the Newspaper Society, which represents local and regional media, today contacted the BBC Trust and media regulator Ofcom asking them to suspend the public value inquiry into the corporation's plans for local news services. </p> <p>The Newspaper Society, through law firm Clifford Chance, accused the BBC Trust of failing to share vital market information to allow it to assess the impact of the corporation's local expansion plans. </p> <p>The society argues that the BBC's plans would duplicate content already offered by local newspaper websites.</p> <p>A public value test has been launched by the trust over BBC management proposals to spend up to \u00a323m a year to create video-based news websites in 60 regions of the UK.</p> <p>The BBC Trust is due to publish interim recommendations on these local online video plans by November 27.</p> <p>However, today the Newspaper Society asked the BBC Trust and Ofcom, which supplies a market impact assessment to the trust as part of each public value test, to delay their reports. </p> <p>The society has accused the trust of failing to provide enough information to allow it to respond to Ofcom's market impact assessment.</p> <p>Specifically, it accused consultants hired by BBC management of setting aside 20 years of competition law by not assessing market impacts in local media markets, and instead analysing media markets generically or across categories, such as metropolitan, urban, mixed and rural.</p> <p>The Newspaper Society added that Ofcom was minded to accept the BBC position on media markets, which would lead to the regulator's market impact assessment being \"fundamentally flawed\". </p> <p>In addition, the society said that the trust had failed to provide it with information about staffing on BBC local sites, salaries of staff, audience reach and the cost and funding of the proposed new services. </p> <p>The society said that it cannot test the BBC claim that the new service would have the same impact in different local media markets across the country without such data. </p> <p>In its letter today, the Newspaper Society was also critical of comments made last month by the BBC Trust chairman, Sir Michael Lyons, who said: \"There's nobody who can be satisfied with the quality of local news in most parts of the United Kingdom.\"</p> <p>The Newspaper Society director, David Newell, said: \"The BBC Trust cannot be the chief cheerleader for the BBC, encouraging it to extend local services out of more and more taxpayers' money, at the same time as being the independent regulator determining the public value of those services and their impact on local media. </p> <p>\"Our legal advice confirms that the trust and Ofcom are acting in an inappropriate and unlawful manner. We would ask that [the] BBC Trust and Ofcom suspend the current market impact and public value test with immediate effect.\"</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the BBC Trust said: \"The public value test is an independent, evidence-based process used to evaluate significant service proposals from the BBC. It is the decision-making process for new services set out in the Royal Charter and Agreement.</p> <p>\"The BBC Trust and Ofcom have met with the Newspaper Society on several occasions to discuss their concerns. Consistent with that approach, we will also respond to their letter shortly and before the trust reaches its provisional conclusions, the deadline for which is November 27.\"</p> <p>An Ofcom spokesman added: \"I can confirm that we have received a letter from the Newspaper Society and are reviewing it.<br> \"Ofcom carries out market impact assessments independent of the BBC and we are working to submit our statement to the BBC Trust according to the existing time lines.\"</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>The billionaire property developer, Donald Trump, today won permission to build \"the world's greatest golf course\", complete with high-rise timeshare flats and eight storey hotel, on a rare and ecologically sensitive stretch of dunes overlooking the North Sea.</p> <p>The New York-based businessman said he was \"greatly honoured\" after Scottish ministers in Edinburgh confirmed that his dream of creating one of golf's most northerly resorts had been approved, despite vociferous opposition from environmentalists and many local residents.</p> <p>And his most famous opponent, Michael Forbes, the fisherman and quarry worker who earned abuse from Trump last year after refusing repeatedly to sell his home at the centre of the resort, still has no intention of moving out.</p> <p>\"He has no hope in hell of getting us away,\" said his wife, Sheila Forbes. \"We're staying put, and that's it.\"</p> <p>The \u00a31bn resort, north of Aberdeen, will feature two 18-hole championship courses, four blocks of 950 timeshare flats, 500 private homes, 36 villas, a golf academy, housing for 400 staff connected by a coast road officially named \"Trump Boulevard\".</p> <p>Today's outline planning approval, however, legally binds Trump to agree to a series of environmental checks and controls, giving Aberdeenshire council and the Scottish government's environment agency, Scottish Natural Heritage, legal oversight to ensure remaining plant species and wildlife are fully protected.</p> <p>Trump will also be required to build a 225-pupil primary school, shops, 98 low-cost houses and 50 starter homes - on land provided free by the council - in return for the private 500-home estate, chalets and the timeshares, which will fund the entire development.</p> <p>The widely-anticipated decision was welcomed by the local constituency MSP, first minister and leader of the Scottish National party, Alex Salmond, and by numerous business and tourism groups as a major boost to the regional economy.</p> <p>Salmond, whose party faces a crucial byelection on Thursday in Glenrothes, Fife, insisted he had not influenced the decision. \"In tough economic times, substantial investment of this kind is at a premium. Six thousand jobs, including 1,400 which will be local and permanent, is a powerful argument,\" he said.</p> <p>\"This proposal would never have been made if it were not for the outstanding natural beauty of the area. It is entirely right and proper that the resources of the country are harnessed to boost one of our great industries, and tourism is a great Scottish industry.\"</p> <p>Trump added: \"It will be a tremendous asset and source of pride for both Aberdeenshire and Scotland for many generations. As I have often said, because of the quality of the land we are given to work with, we will build the greatest golf course in the world.\"</p> <p>Conservationists were furious since ministers had agreed to override legal protection for part of the Foveran links, a system of naturally shifting sand dunes, which are designated a site of special scientific interest under EU habitats legislation, but are central to Trump's vision.</p> <p>The so-called \"back nine\" holes of the main 18-hole course will be built over about a tenth of the dunes despite protests from Trump's own ecologists and SNH that this was unnecessarily destructive.</p> <p>Trump had refused to move that section of the course, again overruling his own environmental experts, telling the planning inquiry in June that he didn't do \"half-assed\". It was, he told the inspectors, all or nothing. It was the \"magnificence of the dunes, the valleys of the dunes, the access to the ocean, the views of the ocean, the elevations\" that made it \"potentially, the greatest course in the world\", he told the inquiry.</p> <p>The planning inspectors ruled that the damage to the dunes was outweighed by the resort's substantial value to the economy - a judgment challenged by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.</p> <p>\"It appears that the desires of one high profile overseas developer, who refused to compromise one inch, have been allowed to override the legal protection of this important site,\" said Aedan Smith, head of planning for RSPB Scotland.</p> <p>Martin Ford, the Liberal Democrat councillor whose casting vote against the development forced Scottish ministers to \"call in\" the plans, said: \"This is a very, very bad precedent indeed and sends out a bad message about the protection in Scotland of our natural heritage sites.</p> <p>\"It appears to me to be a vanity project. I don't think we can claim this is a nationally important development, and it certainly did not need to be built on this site.\"</p> <p>Critics of Trump's proposals, which also breach Aberdeenshire's local development plan by building homes on green belt, believe Scottish ministers have been over-awed by his reputation.</p> <p>Jack McConnell, the then Labour first minister of Scotland, met Trump twice in the US after his resort proposals emerged, facing accusations that his neutrality was being compromised. Salmond too was accused of being \"cavalier\" in his dealings with Trump and his aides after an investigation by MSPs at Holyrood.</p> <p>Trump, owner of the Miss World beauty pageants, has also been warned that he can only begin building the high rise timeshare blocks - already nicknamed \"the Benidorms\" by angry local residents - in stages after a certain number of affordable homes are completed.</p> <p>He must also ensure that local walkers and visitors will still have unimpeded access to the dunes under Scotland's strict right to roam legislation - rules Trump was unaware of until he was questioned by the Ramblers Association at the planning inquiry.</p>",
  "<p>Chicago was today bracing itself for a huge and possibly chaotic street party as more than a million people were expected to descend on the city centre tomorrow night in anticipation of a victory for Democratic presidential hopeful, Barack Obama.</p> <p>Obama, who lives in Chicago, has planned a huge public party in Grant Park which is in the downtown area. The campaign issued more than 70,000 tickets for the event but they were sold out in a matter of hours. Nonetheless huge numbers are expected to come into the city anyway, prompting a major security clampdown, concern about public safety and some businesses to send employees home early.</p> <p>\"It's going to be surprising,\" Chicago mayor, Richard Daley told the Chicago Tribune. \"There are going to be a lot of people who want to come down to celebrate, we hope it's a million or more, that's realistic. It's going to be wonderful. Only the private event is ticket. You can be in the park and around it ... You think I'm nuts? You think I'm not going to invite people down? The mayor's not going to tell anybody not to come to this celebration, It's a historic event. If they want to be there, they should.\"</p> <p>Republican contender John McCain is meanwhile scheduled to hold a far more low-key affair in his home state of Arizona at the Biltmore resort and spa where he's expected to address roughly 2,000 people.</p> <p>The scale of Obama's event in Chicago is causing a logistical nightmare for the local law enforcement. Last Friday police superintendent Jody Weis warned, \"We can't have foolishness. We can't have mischief.\" </p> <p>And last week helicopters flew low over Hutchinson Field, the part of Grant Park where the rally will take place, while police scoured rooftops on downtown buildings. All Chicago police officers have had their days off cancelled for the night and local firefighters have been asked to have their personal equipment handy at home.</p> <p>\"We expect a good, supportive crowd, and we expect it to be a happy occasion,\" Obama's campaign manager, David Axelrod, has said. \"Whatever the result, we don't expect trouble.\"</p> <p>Even the US Coast Guard will patrol in Burnham harbour and on Lake Michigan, which borders the park. With traffic expected to be snarled and parking banned in large areas of the city the decision to stage an event of this scale has proved controversial in the city. </p> <p>A Chicago Tribune website poll asking whether the rally is a good idea showed the city evenly split with 52% in favour and 48% opposed.</p> <p>McCain's operatives have ridiculed Obama's event as typically ostentatious and self-aggrandising. \"I don't know if he is planning another Berlin moment, but we're having what will be a great victory night celebration with a lot of supporters,\" said campaign spokesman Brian Rogers, referring to the throngs that turned up to greet Obama in Europe in July.</p> <p>Hotels overlooking Grant Park have been booking up fast. Steve Wood and some of his neighbours booked a block of suites at the Essex Inn, which has a view of the park. He plans to watch events unfold with his partner and 9-year-old twin daughters. </p> <p>\"If my parents had taken me to JFK's victory night party when I was 9 years old,\" he told the Chicago Tribune. \"That would be something I'd remember the rest of my life.\"</p>",
  "<p>From Greg Sargent at TPM, <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/11/poll_mccains_attacks_on_obama.php\">a new poll</a> showing that McCain's relentless attacks haven't taken. Just like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/nov/03/us-election-republicans-democrats-tomasky\">a certain guy</a> wrote in a column today! From Greg:<br></p> <blockquote> <p><br>Some interesting numbers from the internals of the new NBC/WSJ poll illustrate as clearly as you could want that every one of McCain's major attack lines has been a complete flop:</p> <p>* Despite months of attacks on Obama's allegedly sinister background and cultural identity, a solid majority of likely voters, 57%, say that Obama has a background and set of values they can identify with, versus only 39% who say he doesn't. Those numbers are virtually identical to McCain's, which are 57%-38%.</p> <p>* Asked which would concern them more about an Obama presidency, his lack of experience or the possibility that he would raise taxes, 14% cite taxes and 20% cite inexperience. Forty-eight percent -- more than those two combined -- say that \"neither is a concern.\" This, despite weeks of attacks on Obama as a lightweight and empty suit who wants to hike taxes on ordinary plumbers and hockey moms everywhere.</p> <p>* Despite all the attacks suggesting that Obama harbors a secret and shadowy agenda that he has yet to reveal, a huge majority of 67% say that they know what Obama and Biden would do if elected.</p> <p>All those lies, all for naught.</p> </blockquote> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Last Friday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/31/law-jack-straw-witchcraft\">a petition was presented</a> to justice secretary Jack Straw demanding that posthumous pardons be granted to the hundreds of women and men who were executed in Britain between the 16th and the 18th centuries for allegedly practising witchcraft. At first I thought that the petition was nothing more than a Halloween stunt \u2013 it was, after all, sponsored by <a href=\"http://www.angels.uk.com/\">Angels</a>, the theatrical costumiers who, according to the petition, are \"the UK's largest Halloween retailer\". But apparently it isn't. Messrs Angels are serious. \"We were gobsmacked,\" Emma Angel declared, \"to discover that though the law was changed hundreds of years ago [1735] and society had moved on, the victims were never officially pardoned.\"</p> <p>Well of course \"society\" is always \"moving on.\" What my forebears \u2013 and I daresay yours \u2013 regarded as \"right\" may now be considered very wrong \u2013 capital punishment, for instance, or the criminalisation of homosexual activity, or even the smoking of cigars. But the past cannot be rewritten. Nor should the power of the state be invoked to attempt to rewrite it.</p> <p>Angels' Halloween initiative is but the latest twist in a very sinister trend, whereby the state is being asked to impose a particular interpretation or re-interpretation of history. The origins of this trend are to be found in the undoubtedly good intentions of those who sought posthumous pardons for men and women hanged for murders they certainly did not commit \u2013 Timothy Evans (<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/25/newsid_3721000/3721267.stm\">executed in 1950</a> on the perjured evidence of the necrophiliac ex-policeman, John Christie) is a case in point. I can just about remember the Evans case. The arguments for a pardon, granted in 1966, were overwhelming <em>at that time</em>. They would not be so now, more than a half-century later.</p> <p>The trend to invoke the power of the state to rewrite history was accelerated by the campaigns conducted by relatives of those men who were executed for cowardice during the first world war. </p> <p>Two years ago the government pushed through a most ill-conceived piece of legislation designed to grant <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/aug/17/military.immigrationpolicy\">posthumous pardons</a> to 306 British soldiers who were sentenced to execution by firing squad for cowardice and other military offences during the first world war. Some of these unfortunates were undoubtedly suffering from psychiatric conditions (\"shell shock\") that we would now describe as forms of post-traumatic stress. But others were not. The \"statutory group pardon\" that parliament was persuaded to grant to all the British soldiers executed for military offences during the first world war applied equally to deliberate deserters \u2013 genuine cowards.</p> <p>Even if we agree that some of those executed were in fact suffering from stress-related disorders, to pardon them now was to apply the standards of 2006 to the circumstances of 1916. It may well be that some of those executed for witchcraft 400 and more years ago were indeed simply marginalised individuals upon whom Elizabethan and Stuart society sought vengeance for natural disasters, such as crop failures. To pardon them now is to apply the standards of 2008 to the circumstances of 1588. We have no right to do this.</p> <p>And why restrict this re-writing of the past to military personnel and witches? At his own trial John Christie pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, a plea that the Old Bailey jury rejected. But today the plea might well be accepted. So what about a royal pardon for John Christie?</p> <p>And why stop with Christie? Why not examine every case in which the death penalty was carried out, and grant pardons as necessary? And why stop with the death penalty? In 1895 Oscar Wilde was famously sentenced to two years' imprisonment for having had a homosexual affair with Lord Alfred Douglas. Such a trial would never be held today. So what about a pardon for Oscar? And for all the other male homosexuals convicted of acts which today are not criminal offences at all?</p> <p>And what about Charles I? Mary Queen of Scots? Joan of Arc? Each of these, it might be argued, deserves what we might interpret as \"justice\". Why not devote the resources of the state to re-examining all these cases \u2013 and no doubt hundreds if not thousands of others \u2013 and granting pardons as necessary?</p> <p>The answer is that we cannot, in a liberal state, rewrite the past, however much we may be annoyed and upset by the actions of our forebears. The pardons that parliament approved two years ago for British soldiers militarily executed in the first world war amounted to the use of the law to rewrite history. As such I found them profoundly distasteful. I am equally appalled that the state is now being asked to pardon those executed for witchcraft.</p> <p>But I derive some comfort from knowing that a pardon is not an exoneration. The vast majority of British servicemen who fought in the first world war did not desert their posts. Those executed for desertion remain guilty as charged. And the witches so beloved of Messrs Angels will, whatever the outcome of the petition invoked on their behalf, remain, in historical terms, as guilty as hell.</p>",
  "<p>Here is the beginning of a recent <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1081859/It-isnt-crime-Irish-leprechauns-Court-clears-teenager-racially-harassing-neighbour.html\">piece from the Daily Mail</a>, concerning leprechauns:</p> <blockquote> <p>Small and mischievous, they're the green-clad little people who are synonymous with the Emerald Isle. </p> </blockquote> <p>Perhaps you haven't fully grasped how awful it is, how meaninglessly twee, clumsily clich\u00e9d, how casually belittling of several million people, so here it comes again:</p> <blockquote> <p>Small and mischievous, they're the green-clad little people who are synonymous with the Emerald Isle. </p> </blockquote> <p>I don't believe it's possible to say anything about it that could be more offensive than repeating it, so as an act of kindness to its writer, let's move on. The piece in question concerns a recent decision in the law courts that calling an Irish woman a \"fucking leprechaun\" does not constitute racially aggravated harassment. </p> <p>The Mail, which is either a better satirical newspaper than the <a href=\"http://www.theonion.com/content/index\">Onion</a>, or utterly devoid of self-awareness, is delighted that \"common sense prevailed\" because any other decision would have been \"political correctness gone mad\". Unusually, the effect of the decision on the value of your house or the likelihood that reading this liberal codswallop is giving you cancer RIGHT NOW is passed over in silence.</p> <p>Now, without wanting particularly to query the judgment of the courts, I'd like briefly to offer a few considerations on the evidence before returning to an examination of the Mail's response.</p> <p>The woman against whom the case was brought is alleged to have called her neighbour, an Irish woman, a \"fucking leprechaun\" as part of a pattern of behaviour which also included a threat to \"kick the baby out of your stomach\" when she was pregnant. If we need a law to protect us against \"racially aggravated harrassment\", am I wrong to think this is a textbook case?</p> <p>In any case, let's remember that the Mail \u2013 stalwart guardian of traditional British values \u2013 is delighted that a woman who theatens to kick an unborn baby to death in its mother's womb is safely on the streets where she can issue similarly blood-curdling threats to the rest of us, and that our ancient liberties to abuse one another senselessly have been preserved. </p> <p>The Mail also regularly rails against city centre brawling on a Saturday night, but with the clearsightedness for which it is famous, cannot see that sticking up for a culture which values a bit of \"harmless\" bigotry may stoke some of this violence.</p> <p>In fact, the shameful hypocrisy permeates this Mail report on every level. When I say the woman called her neighbour a \"fucking leprechaun\", the Mail tells us rather that the term used was \"******* leprechaun\". Why so squeamish about a catcall which the Mail has already told us is perfectly acceptable? Could it be that these words are sufficiently harmless to be addressed to an innocent Irish woman accompanied by homicidal threats, and yet so ghastly that the Mail could not subject its readership to seeing them in print?</p> <p>Perhaps the worst thing about the whole episode, though, is the sheer tedium of the insult. It should be conceded that the accused's threats of violence have a certain regrettable inventiveness, but that really is playing devil's advocate. Fucking leprechaun? Surely we can do better than that. The victim was from Belfast, so why nothing about <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE5D9143BF932A25750C0A9669C8B63\">empty shipyards</a>? Peace walls? Bowler hats and sashes? If you're going to get yourself into the national press for your heroic unpleasantness, at least put some effort in.</p> <p>There was a time we British had a way with rhetorical barbs. One thinks of the famous exchange between Churchill and the lady who found him so odious she said that if she were his wife she would put poison in his coffee. Churchill calmly replied that if the lady were his wife, he would drink it. </p> <p>Or, if we must have a racial edge, there is Lloyd George's supposed dismissal of the British statesman Herbert Samuel: that when they circumcised him, they threw away the wrong bit. Wildly, needlessly, viciously offensive, and yet surreally imaginative. If he did say it, Lloyd George should have been ashamed of himself, but not of his powers of rhetoric.</p> <p>You see, I know it's wrong to celebrate this sort of thing, but although I like to think of myself as an upstanding member of society, who would wish no harm to anyone, there's another side to me that delights in malicious ingenuity. You might call it the small, mischievous, green-clad little part of me.</p>",
  "<p>Seven men who were part of a robbery gang that stole \u00a3500,000 in an 18-month crime spree targeting security vans were given lengthy prison sentences today. </p> <p>Terence Wallace, Adrian Johnson, Leroy Wilkinson and Victor Iniodu, Leroy Hall, Leon McKenzie and Brian Henry carried out raids in Oxford, Swindon, Bristol, Bath, Cambridgeshire, Hampshire, Reading, Ipswich and Gloucestershire between April 2006 and September last year.</p> <p>The gang's spree ended when flying squad officers ambushed the men near HSBC in the village of Chandlers Ford, Hampshire, after working out where they would strike next. </p> <p>The ringleader, Mark Nunes, was shot dead by police marksmen when he held a pistol to the head of a security guard. Fellow robber Andrew Markland suffered the same fate when he tried to pick up the weapon and a second officer shot him twice.</p> <p>Getaway driver Wallace, 26, and Johnson, 28, received the longest of the sentences handed down by Judge Richard Southwell at Kingston Crown Court, of 17 years each.</p> <p>Wilkinson, 30, received 12 years, Hall and McKenzie, 28, both received seven years, Henry, 32, received six and a half years, and Iniodu, 34, received five years.</p> <p>Southwell, who praised the professionalism of the police operation, said: \"This was serious professional crime, played for high stakes, without regard for public safety.\"</p> <p>Wallace, Johnson, Wilkinson and Iniodu were found guilty of conspiracy after a seven-week trial. Johnson was also convicted of a separate robbery last November. The other three men pleaded guilty to being part of the gang before the trial began.</p> <p>In their biggest haul the men escaped with \u00a3165,000 after pistol-whipping a guard outside a Lloyds TSB in Bristol. During other raids guards were punched and kicked to the ground.</p> <p>The robberies were meticulously planned. The gang targeted Group 4 Security vans as guards were transferring money to high street outlets, selecting only vehicles on low-security routes because they knew they were not equipped with cash boxes that belch out coloured smoke or dye.</p> <p>Locations were chosen next to alleyways for fast getaways and areas were pinpointed where vehicles could be switched. </p> <p>Often two or three stolen cars with false number plates were used, with one being dumped 100 yards down the road to throw police off the scent.</p> <p>Detectives used cell-site analysis - where a position is traced to a mobile phone - to place conspirators at the scenes in the weeks before the robberies. By last summer they had Nunes, who had previously served eight and a half years for armed robbery, and his accomplices under surveillance and were waiting for them in Chandlers Ford, near Southampton, on the morning of September 13.</p> <p>Surveillance footage from the operation was shown to the jury during the trial. As the security guard gets out of the van and Nunes, 35, runs towards him a police officer says: \"Robbery, robbery, strike, strike, strike. He has a gun to his head.\" A shot is heard as Nunes slumps to the floor. Markland, 36, then runs into view and attempts to pick up the weapon dropped by Nunes. He too is shot and falls to the ground.</p> <p>Inquests into the death of Nunes and Markland are to open shortly. <br>The Independent Police Complaints Commission said last month that there was no evidence the marksmen had committed any criminal offences or misconduct, but investigators had found \"issues\" around the implementation of the operation.</p>",
  "<p>Chuku Umunna <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/01/2\"> writes</a> </p> <blockquote> <p>After Labour must come an honest exposition of what Labour is all about \u2013 building a fairer, more equal, democratic and sustainable world \u2013 and an attempt to popularise these notions in the way that Thatcher did for the beliefs of Hayek, Friedman et al. Labour has got to stop running scared for fear of offending and make the case for its politics.</p> <p>But how? The \"living wage\" \u2013 highly desirable in my view \u2013 provides a good example. Let's give the debate around that issue some emotional texture. We do not just strive for a society in which every person has the opportunity to reach their full potential (all parties lay claim to that); we want to build a society in which whatever talents people have, they are rewarded with a comfortable standard of living when they apply them...</p> </blockquote> <p>I'm not sure what \"emotional texture\" means (personal testimonies? food bills?) but I do know that Thatcher had it easy. Her political \"ideology\" boiled down to three simple ingredients that had a strong and primitive resonance with those already well endowed with a reasonable income and deeply rooted social networks: the free market; pared down central government; and the need for individuals to \"stand on their own two feet\". </p> <p>Labour, in contrast, soon became lost in the rhetoric of the \"Third Way\". For the past 11 years, it's as if it has been trying to complete a jigsaw puzzle with pieces from a dozen different boxes, and little clue as to the picture on the box. </p> <p>So what kind of society does it now govern? According to the cabinet office's strong analysis of the bottom rungs of society, <a href=\"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/~/media/assets/ www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/social_exclusion_task_force/think_families/ think_family_life_chances_report%20pdf.ashx\">Think Family</a>, there are around 140,000 families experiencing multiple disadvantage including mental illness, poor housing, low income, alcohol and drug addiction. Each family has the help of up to a dozen \"professionals\", mostly contradicting each other and achieving very little. Child poverty persists on a huge scale. </p> <p>Annually, 45% of young people leave school without a decent set of qualifications; a high proportion of older people live on very low incomes. While last year, Unicef, the UN's children's organisation, put the UK bottom of a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6359363.stm\">table of 21 industrialised countries</a>, measuring wellbeing in children. The Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark and Finland came top. The authors of the report say they used the most up to date information to assess, \"whether children feel loved, cherished, special and supported, within the family and community and whether the family and community are being supported in this task by public policy and resources\".</p> <p>That's the challenge. All politicians say they want a fairer, more equal and sustainable world. What's at issue is the role that the state plays in achieving that aim. Of course what counts is decent housing; an education system that works (according to whose criteria?); proper care for the elderly; en end to poverty; civility; respect; revived social networks. But how is that translated from a shopping list into a linked set of aspirations and an ideology? An ideology that conveys intent in the way that Thatcherism once did, in all its destructiveness, to its followers?<br> Much of what Labour ought to do comes down to redistribution, but not all. If the poorest suddenly have riches yet live in a society in which greed, celebrity and doing nothing for others is the template, what damage does that inflict on citizenship, a sense of personal security, the exercise of democracy and a sense of community? </p> <p>Unlike the 1940s, the 21st century needs to address issues such as resilience and personal control, surveillance and privacy and the damage done when permanent welfare dependency is the government's favoured method of \"support\" instead of using tools that encourage empowerment and independence. </p> <p>Redistribution needs to be driven by a set of beliefs that are not contradictory and ambivalent but that come together to power action. Redistribution also needs a fresh rhetoric that strikes a chord \u2013 not least because the politician mouthing the words, is believed \u2013 for a period at least. They are believed, as Thatcher was, even by those who detested her, because she was driven by personal conviction, not the prime goal of winning the next election. </p> <p>As Thatcher understood then, and Obama understands now, rhetoric has to match a prevailing mood. How can Labour find a simple and striking language that makes the re-allocation of resources an action of universal benefit? As it surely is. </p> <p>How can it develop a set of criteria and goals that speak to what appears to be a growing non-materialistic need in people \u2013 a need to feel connected; valued; part of a community of equals \u2013 not Thatcherite individuals fighting alone? </p> <p>Once again, Labour is a party in search of an ideology. What it needs to do is to respect its past, hold fast to many of its traditional ideals and look to the future, recasting the whole in a platform that it believes in out of principle, not as a cynical electioneering tactic. Umunna says its time for Labour to, \"make the case for its politics\". First, it has to decide on its politics, and only then will be able to make its case. </p> <p><em>\"After New Labour\", the second debate in the \"Who owns the progressive future?\" series, organised by Comment is free and <a href=\"http://www.soundings.org.uk/\">Soundings journal</a>, will take place in London at <a href=\"http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/\">Kings Place</a> tonight at 7pm.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> The big guns have been summoned to Westminster this afternoon for a grilling by MPs who are conducting an urgent inquiry into the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/creditcrunch\">banking crisis</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/alistairdarling\">Alistair Darling</a>, the chancellor, Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, and Lord Turner of Ecchinswell, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, have been hauled before the Treasury select committee to answer questions on the causes of the banking crisis. </p> <p>MPs also want clarification about what responsibilities the banks and the government has to taxpayers.</p> <p>To spice up the proceedings, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/johnmcfall\">John McFall</a>, chairman of the committee, has for the first time asked members of the public to submit questions that the MPs will put to the heads of the so-called tripartite authority, which is responsible for the health of the financial system. I'm told more than 4,000 suggestions were submitted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-339283660\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2008/11/03/mk4.jpg\" alt=\"Mervyn King Darling speaking to the Commons treasury committee\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mervyn King speaking to the Commons treasury committee. Photograph: PA</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fun kicks off at 4pm.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>4:04pm:</strong> They are taking their seats.</p> <p>This is the first time the tripartite group has appeared together, McFall says.</p> <p>It's also the first time they have asked the public to submit questions - there were more than 5,000 in total he says.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>4:08pm:</strong> McFall starts with the chancellor - he asks how the crisis started.</p> <p>Darling says it started across the Atlantic and escalated to the point where banks stopped lending to each other, so the government had to step in.</p> <p>\"If you look at the money paid into Northern Rock, it is being paid slightly ahead of schedule,\" Darling says. \"The reason we are doing it is because it's necessary to restore the banking system because we all rely on it.\"</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>4:15pm:</strong> The \u00a337bn bailout, is that not an admission that banking regulation has failed? McFall asks Turner.</p> <p>He says it has been a global problem.</p> <p>McFall asks King if the taxpayer has been \"taken for a mug\".</p> <p>King insists recapitalisation was exactly the right response.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>4:20pm:</strong> McFall reads out another submitted question about where the money is coming from to pay for the bank bail-out.</p> <p>Darling says the government will borrow it in the normal way and details will be set out at the time of the pre-budget report.</p> <p>Conservative MP Michael Fallon asks the chancellor, if he takes responsibility for the boom, why not the bust?</p> <p>Darling says there are lessons to be learned but the problem is a deficiency in spotting the way problems build up not just in our own country but elsewhere as well.</p> <p>Fallon says Darling and Gordon Brown were responsible for all this; why not accept responsibility and say sorry?</p> <p>The chancellor says he accepts responsibility for things he is responsible for but in the future we must be aware of what banks are responsible for.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>4:24pm:</strong> The consequences of what happened in the American banking system were \"catastrophic\", Darling says. \"We need to keep a close eye on what is going on elsewhere.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>4:23pm:</strong> Turner says the tripartite authority reached a decision that a bail-out of the British banking system was necessary. \"It was obvious in discussions that something radical had to be done to restore confidence,\" Turner says.</p> <p>They did \"extreme stress tests\" on bank assets. \"There was a process of developing stress tests that determined what was required to restore confidence,\" he says.</p> <p>It is put to Turner that the reason full confidence has not been restored is because banks fear there are still some \"toxic\" loans yet to be discovered. He rejects the suggestion, saying that it takes time to recover after such a big jolt to confidence.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>4:30pm:</strong> Darling is asked about banks failing to honour commitments to lend to individuals and small businesses at the same rate as last year.</p> <p>Darling says he is about to write to the committee to set out details of the body to oversee the government's stake in the banks. The treasury said earlier today that the arms' length body would closely monitor activity, especially lending to small businesses and the treatment of mortgage holders, but would not intervene in day-to-day decisions.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>4:32pm:</strong> Darling says they will publish the agreements they have with the banks.</p> <p>Darling is asked about city bonuses.</p> <p>The chancellor says anyone who uses the bank reconstruction arrangements will be treated the same way.</p> <p>\"There will be restrictions while the preference shares are there,\" he says.</p> <p>The sitting is suspended for 10 minutes while MPs attend a vote in the Commons.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>4:45pm:</strong> They're back.</p> <p>Hot of the press: George Osborne, the shadow chancellor (who is not at the committee) is apparently calling this afternoon for a full public inquiry into banking crisis. Witnesses should include not only regulators but Gordon Brown himself, the Tories say.</p> <p>Back to the committee...</p> <p>Conservative MP Graham Brady wants to know why people with money in Equitable Life aren't being treated the same way as people with money invested in banks and building societies.</p> <p>Darling says he understands the problem and has many constituents affected by the problem, but Equitable Life is a different issue and they hope to respond to the problem shortly.</p> <p>McFall comes back in to ask about the future of lending and deposits.</p> <p>King says, in the future, banks will need to generate new levels of funding.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>4:54pm:</strong> McFall asks Turner if there will be more \"imbalance\" in the future.</p> <p>\"I think there is going to be some sort of process of rebalancing,\" Turner says.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>4:47pm:</strong> Lord Thurso reads out a question about why HBOS and Lloyds should be merged. \"What are the pressing matters of financial stability which means [Lord] Mandelson has pushed aside competitive practices to let this go through?\" he adds.</p> <p>The only alternative was full scale nationalisation, which would have had very big consequences, King says. The merger was in the public interest and now that it's there on the table, you can't undo it, he says.</p> <p>Thurso asks the chancellor why it has now become a commercial decision which doesn't need any intervention any more?</p> <p>Darling says HBOS had to engage in a rights issue, which wasn't without its problems, and it became clear that the best thing to do was get involved with Lloyds TSB. He decided to allow this to happen in the interests of financial stability. It's up to the shareholders to decide if they want to vote for the merger, Darling says.</p> <p>\"It's open to anyone else to put in a bid,\" he says, \"But I say to you that so far no one else has come forward.\"</p> <p>The chancellor urges the committee to look at the Office of Fair Trading report into HBOS's financial situation and suggests that, even if the deal goes ahead, it is not necessarily out of the woods.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>5:04pm:</strong> Thurso asks about compensation for people with Bradford and Bingley shares. Darling says everyone feels very sorry for small shareholders in B&amp;B and they will be entitled to whatever is left when everyone else is paid off, but he admits the prospects \"aren't great\".</p> <p>Thurso asks if the shareholders have any recourse from directors who told them everything was ok. Darling says he would be careful about offering them legal advice.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>5:05pm:</strong> McFall says if you've got money in B&amp;B and a director stands up and says everything is ok and it goes bust four days later, is that not bad supervision?</p> <p>Turner says the markets were moving very fast.</p> <p>King is asked about his claim some time back that Northern Rock had a \"good quality loan book\".</p> <p>He says it followed advice from the FSA.</p> <p>The same question is put to Turner. The FSA chairman says there was no evidence at the time that the loan to value ratios were bad.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>5:13pm:</strong> Darling is asked why anti-terror laws were used to freeze the assets of the Icelandic bank.</p> <p>The chancellor said it was \"contemplated at the time that the powers may be used more widely\".</p> <p>\"We did need to step in to protect the interests of the British taxpayers. It is my job to protect the British taxpayer and I'm perfectly happy to stand up and do that,\" he says.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>5:15pm:</strong> MP Mark Todd asks what is being done to strengthen the FSA's grip on the banking sector.</p> <p>Turner says a very major programme - the supervisory programme - has been put in place with \"218 extra people on top of the 500 already there.\"</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>5:21pm:</strong> Turner is asked if any bonuses are being paid in the regulatory sector.</p> <p>He says some will be. \"We will not reward bad work but it is part of our remuneration package to reward good work,\" he says.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>5:27pm:</strong> MP Sally Keeble asks about credit ratings agencies.</p> <p>Darling says there are plans to regulate credit rating agencies across a number of countries.</p> <p>When is it going to happen? she asks.</p> <p>Darling says you need a solution certainly at a European level but also a global level and although it's \"frustratingly slow at times\" there is no point in Britain acting alone. \"You do need other countries involved in this,\" he says.</p> <p>\"I'm optimistic we will get something agreed with Europe if not the end of this year, then certainly some time next year,\" Darling adds. \"But a wider agreement, involving America, will take longer.\"</p> <p>Turner says credit rating agencies tried to predict the likelihood of single banks or companies defaulting and they were quite accurate on the whole, but over time it became clear that they were subject to much more rapid changes.</p> <p>Turner says credit rating agencies tried to predict the likelihood of single banks or companies defaulting and they were quite accurate on the whole, but over time it became clear that they were subject to much more rapid changes.</p> <p>He says he's not opposed to regulation of credit rating agencies but suggests they will be used more appropriately and won't be relied upon for information they are not qualified to give.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>5:40pm:</strong> There is another 10-minute break while MPs attend another Commons vote.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>5:50pm:</strong> They're back. McFall is asking Turner whether the boards of banks have run amok?</p> <p>Turner says they are going to have to think in future how even very competent people can go into enough detail.</p> <p>McFall asks the Bank of England governor if he is now going to \"stick his nose in individual institutions\".</p> <p>King says the fact that there is a crisis isn't evidence in itself that people in charge of banks have done something wrong.</p> <p>\"We needed, and now we are going to get, a regulation framework for banks... regulation of liquidity...\"</p> <p>How can we get better, more alert people in charge of banks? McFall asks.</p> <p>King says what he is suggesting would be putting the government in full charge of banks.</p> <p>MP Jim Cousins asks what is going to be done to help the housing market and home owners who are in difficulty?</p> <p>Darling replies that all banks and building societies are being asked to \"pursue every alternative to reposession\".</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>5.56pm:</strong> Darling says the constraints placed on Northern Rock are a result of European legislation on state aid.</p> <p>\"That is the reason Northern Rock is reducing its loan book at the moment,\" the chancellor says. \"In relation to people looking for mortgages, although mortgage availability isn't a problem now it will be when the housing market picks up and I've asked James Crosby [who is reviewing the mortgage market] to look at that.\"</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>6:04pm:</strong> Cousins asks the chancellor about the BBC's business editor Robert Peston. Darling says to laughter he can't answer for Peston. Cousins says there are suggestions Peston is \"the real governor of the BoE\" and asks about leaks of information.</p> <p>Turner says: \"There is no sign there is market abuse. There is leakage of information that shouldn't be leaked... we are troubled by that but we can only investigate that when there is sign of an offence against market rules.\"</p> <p>Turner says he will take what Cousins says and \"look into it further\". He adds \"We are troubled by that but we can only investigate that when there is sign of an offence against market rules. We are continually monitoring unusual movements in markets.\"</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>6:04pm:</strong> The committee moves on to the issue of the Icelandic bank.</p> <p>Darling again defends the steps he took to protect British taxpayers.</p> <p>\"Iceland has been having problems for some time,\" he says.</p> <p>Asked about depositors from the Isle of Man, Darling indicates that his obligation is only to people who put their deposits in UK branches.</p> <p>Michael Fallon, the committee's deputy chairman, accuses the chancellor of \"washing his hands\" of the people of the Isle of Man. Darling rejects this.</p> <p>The chancellor says that one thing this situation has shown is \"we need to have a long hard look at the relationship between this country and the Isle of Man, a tax haven\".</p> <p>There would be \"no knee-jerk reaction\" but Darling adds: \"It is something this committee might want to look into.\"</p> <p>And with that the evidence session was brought to a close.</p>",
  "<p>Three weeks ago Greg and I attended a Gears of War 2 press event in London. A dozen or so journalists were put up in the St Martins Lane hotel near Trafalgar Square and allowed to play the game all night. The multiplayer modes were running downstairs in a large conference suite, but we also had an Xbox 360 and a copy of the game in each of our own rooms. The results were embargoed until today.</p> <p>Here's what I took from my ten or so hours with the game. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/nov/03/gears-war-2\">Greg's point-of-view</a> will be different, I'm almost certain. This isn't a review, because I didn't finish it, it's a sort of first response, written a day afterwards.</p> <p>Just to give you a hint: I bloody loved it. <br><br>At the beginning of Gears of War 2, humanity isn't so much on its knees as face down in the space dust, with a Locust foot pressing on its skull. The remnants of the population are hiding out in Jacinto, the only city that the alien hordes can't burrow under. But here, survivors are being eaten away by a new pest \u2013 a disease known as rust lung, caused by the Lightmass Bomb detonation at the close of the first game. </p> <p>And this is by no means the last moment where humanity must face up to the consequences of its own actions. Weirdly for such a visceral, balls-out blaster, the value of human existence provides a bit of an ongoing theme, lurking in the background as you chainsaw aliens to pieces. Right at the start of the action a politician delivers a stirring speech to the gathered gears, lamenting mankind's atavistic need to fight, but then insisting that the only way forward is a counter-offensive against the Locust masses, taking the battle into their subterranean homeland. </p> <p>And that's your job in Gears of War 2, inhabiting the blood-splattered boots of Marcus Fenix and leading Delta squad into the unknowable underground hell. But as you go through the game, both the nature of the Horde and the attempts to 'save' humanity are brought into question. Someone somewhere has a hidden agenda and your military commanders are keeping it from you. There's something rotten in the state of Jacinto; there have been\u2026 experiments. </p> <p>In general, though, you're pretty much where you were in Gears of War: fighting your way through an obliterated landscape, facing greater numbers of ever more vicious and heavily armed Horde monsters. This is everything you loved about Gears of War, polished, heightened and exaggerated. The visuals are amazing, not just for the incredible design detail \u2013 the charred landscapes, the devastated research stations covered in rust and broken glass, the weird alien vegetation \u2013 but for the extraordinarily accomplished use of dramatic lighting. Gun metal glistens and glints, while looming shadows swallow lurking enemies whole and explosions sear your retinas like burning phosphorus. It's a brilliantly solid, gritty world \u2013 like a war documentary, filmed on a camcorder by terrified soldiers.</p> <p>The pace is relentless. One minute you're ricocheting down a valley manning the gun turret on a massive tunneling rig, the next you're blasting into the depths of the earth aboard a hideously dangerous grind lift. Levels mix claustrophobic tunnels with vast chambers, often allowing you glimpses of far-off locust battalions as they swarm in your direction - or toward stricken comrades. Guns, as in the first game, feel perfect, with semi-automatic rifles providing measured, controllable fire, while shotguns splatter death across the walls. </p> <p>A couple of things, though. While the cover system has obviously been improved and tends to work well, there are still a few fiddly moments. Encasing the run option within the cover mechanism can make things tricky, because while running, Marcus has a really wide turn circle \u2013 not great for navigating labyrinthine tunnels at speed. There are also a couple of stages that seem to pastiche well-worn videogame clich\u00e9s (at least I hope they're a pastiche) \u2013 these don't work well and draw you out what is an incredibly immersive experience for most of the time.</p> <p>Away from the single-player campaign, me and Greg spent a long time playing Horde, the frantic new co-op mode, in which five human comrades battle together through waves of locust soldiers. The aim is to kill a set number of enemies within the strict time limit, and any soldier downed during the effort is out of the game until the stage is beaten. The fights take place over a number of locations festooned with gun emplacements, burned out vehicles and withered trees. It's an absolute blast, a sort of turbo-charged sci-fi version of Assault on Precinct 13. Locust troops of every kind charge at you, including loads of GoW favourites and all the newcomers. And the really cool thing is, when you are killed, you get access to a god mode that lets you explore the whole area, informing your still-living mates about enemy positions.</p> <p>The new Submission mode \u2013 or as Epic calls it 'Meat Flag' - is a killer too. It's essentially capture the flag, except, you're out to capture a 'stranded' - a civilian human \u2013 who must be shot to his knees, then grabbed and dragged to your base. The carrier can only use a handgun to protect himself so teamwork is essential. Also, if the guy with the stranded gets taken out, the freed civilian turns into a bad ass killing machine, slaughtering anyone caught nearby with his shotgun. \"It was an idea that probably came up while we were drunk one night,\" explained Epic's Mike Capp to me the morning after the press event. \"A flag with a gun\u2026\"</p> <p>So, yeah, amazing. An utter screaming headrush of a game, which provides totally and unapologetically ceaseless entertainment. There's lots I haven't sampled yet \u2013 the drop-in/drop-out co-op sounds fun, allowing players of different abilities to jump into each other's games, with the difficultly level altering accordingly. There are intriguing narrative strands developing in here too, including \u2013 strangely enough - an ongoing love story.</p> <p>There's also a question that keeps coming back throughout the game, in plot points, and dialogue and artifacts discovered during your journey. Is this desperate, nightmarish tragedy of an existence really worth all the effort? It's like the 2029 scenes from Terminator \u2013 just violence and death handed out by a totally alien intelligence. Gears of War 2 could well be the most nihilistic shoot-'em-up ever created. The great thing is, whatever you're fighting for, even if it's worthless, it's terrific fun.</p>",
  "<p>Wandering around his echoey Edinburgh flat, the novelist Michel Faber appears at a loss over where to put himself \u2013 he spends most of his time in a house up in the Highlands. Eventually he plumps for the kitchen, where we sit at a table strewn with foreign editions of his books. He shifts in his chair as he tells me that it's been five years since he's given an interview. </p> <p>\"For a number of years there I just craved my solitude too much, I felt I'd lost my space,\" says Faber. Softly spoken, his voice hints at his early childhood in Holland and his upbringing in Australia. He considers every question carefully and answers eloquently, is meticulously polite, but there's still a sense that he's unused to being around people, that this is an intrusion on his privacy.</p> <p>The international interest in The Crimson Petal and the White, his 800-page plus story of Victorian prostitute Sugar, meant an endless round of touring and publicity for Faber. He couldn't stand the sequence of \"soulless corporate hotels where the windows don't open\", and would ask if he could stay with a local bookseller, or a fan. This happened a few times \"and was great, I slept on people's floors and got to know their dogs\" \u2013 you can imagine the excitement of the reader who put up Michel Faber \u2013 but \"often that wasn't possible and they'd put me in these ghastly places, they would think they were doing me a favour and showing me the appropriate respect\".</p> <p>In the end, he says, it just got easier to say no to everything, just a blanket \"I'm not doing anything\". \"My energies get used up quite quickly and the psychic space I'm in when I write is a very lonely one, so I found that harder and harder to get back to,\" he says. \"Someone who doesn't have fantasies of fame and fortune, who is doing it for its own sake. If a time comes in their life when beyond all expectation there's lots of interest it is strange.\" </p> <p>Faber is an author who is impossible to pigeonhole. With traces of both science fiction and horror, his first novel, Under the Skin, was about a woman who abducts hitchhikers in Scotland for her own dark ends; novella The Courage Consort was about avant-garde musicians struggling both to get on with each other and to master the complex composition they're rehearsing. This one, The Fire Gospel, reinvents his storytelling again: part of Canongate's Myths series, it is Faber's take on the Prometheus story, and infused throughout with fire imagery as well as Faber's own dark humour.</p> <p>It wasn't always this way. The novel was originally going to be \"very serious, very dark\", says Faber, inspired by the \"outrage and bemusement\" he was feeling at the UK and US's moves into Iraq and Afghanistan.</p> <p>Instead, he decided he could get those feelings across \"while at the same time giving the reader a great read and lots of fun as well\". The Fire Gospel centres on Aramaic scholar Theo Griepenkerl, who discovers a fifth gospel which sheds a disturbing light on the life \u2013 and death - of Jesus; his last words on the cross are \"Please, somebody, please finish me\". An instant suc\u00e8s de scandale - Faber provides a hilariously cynical portrait of publishers getting their heads around the book's reception - events quickly start to spiral out of control. </p> <p>Faber's original concept for The Fire Gospel had been that the Theo character would immediately be captured by Al Qaida-type terrorists, and would narrate the story from captivity. Instead, Theo tours the US, obsessively checking Amazon for reviews (\"I did not buy this book, so this author will not make a dime off me. I read it over a two day period in my local bookstore,\" writes one), sleeping with his publisher, gradually \u2013 and inadvertently - stoking the flames of religious outrage. </p> <p>I ask Faber if he's one of those authors \u2013 and there are definitely a few \u2013 who, like Theo, check their Amazon sales ranking obsessively, even posting their own glowing reviews. No he's not, he insists, not at all. \"When you read it did you assume it must be me?\", he asks worriedly. \"Of course it's fun writing about an egomaniac, but I know there are going to be reviewers who've never met me, who don't know anything about me, who are going to say this is autobiography, he's just changed the names of a few people and the rest is totally as it was.\"</p> <p>For the record, he doesn't appear even the slightest bit egomaniacal, and despite his own success says he had to guess at the number of books it took Theo to sell to become a bestseller. \"I've probably got the sales figures wrong by a factor of 10 or something,\" he muses. </p> <p>In some authors the mentions of disinterest in book sales, of writing purely for writing's sake, could seem disingenuous but in Faber they really don't. A nurse before Under the Skin was picked up by a publisher, he is still genuinely grateful, genuinely delighted, that he is able to earn his living as a writer. He lives in the Scottish Highlands, he spends his money on second hand music (he's a particular fan of \"an Italian avant garde jazz prog electronic hardline communist group\"), he won't sign a contract for anything he hasn't finished writing because he doesn't want anything to be published by someone who doesn't truly love it. \"I never ever want to be in a position where people are sitting round a table, saying we've got this book, I don't really get it but we paid for it so we've got to sell it. I'm not Tony Parsons, that's not right for me.\"</p> <p>The Crimson Petal took 20 years to write, transcribed painstakingly by hand in tiny script on lined paper. \"Under The Skin probably took 18 months,\" says Faber. \"I wrote some sketches for an earlier version of The Fire Gospel several years ago and threw them away; it was the wrong time of my life to be writing another novel because I was so determined to withdraw from the literary scene. Then sometime last year, the novel knocked on my brain and told me it was keen to be written. I wrote it in sequence, from the first page to the last, in two or three months.\"</p> <p>The book grew out of the thinking Faber had been doing about faith, and his desire to write something about religious fundamentalism. An atheist who used to want to \"eradicate religion from the human spirit and convert all churches into secondhand record emporiums\", Faber says he's now less militant about religion and is preaching tolerance.</p> <p>\"I think there is that very basic yearning for something or someone to be looking after us, for there to be a framework holding the universe together that is benign and intelligent. We're not going to get rid of that, it's just too scary to be that molecule flying around briefly in a vacuum,\" he says.</p> <p>For Faber, the question is whether religion can play a positive role in people's lives, or whether it's \"doomed to just cause grief and discord\". </p> <p>\"We should be able to communicate with someone who believes the world was created in seven days or who believes that after they die they go to nirvana and virgins tend to them or whatever,\" he says. \"There's nothing intrinsic to that delusion that's more awful or terrible than any number of other things that are annoying or bizarre about people.\"</p> <p>It is at this individual level that the conflicts between the Muslim world and the west can be resolved, he continues. \"Once all the high-falutin journalism has been written, and all the slogans have been shouted, and the speeches have been made by the Bushes and the Blairs, and the damage has been done, and the cities reduced to rubble, and people's lives have been completely ruined, after all that's happened, what will happen is that individuals start communicating.\"</p> <p>Despite his obvious passion it's difficult to shake off the impression that Faber would rather not be here. Communication has been a little difficult for him over the last five years, he admits, during which time he wrote an \"enormously hurtful\" book which has never seen the light of day. He's only decided to do interviews again because his publishers around the world have stuck by him during a period when he was in a \"blue funk\", cynical about the literary world. With the publication of The Fire Gospel, he's decided it's time \"to at least say 'hello'.\"</p>",

  "<p>The unfathomably brutal <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/31/congo-unitednations-miliband\">civil war devastating the eastern Congo</a>, which is now reaching yet another peak of savagery, is not really about Congo. It is the continuation of the civil war and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/flash/0,,1181893,00.html\">genocide</a> that shattered neighbouring <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/rwanda\">Rwanda</a> in the early 1990s.</p> <p>This war should be fought inside Rwanda. Pillage, mass murder, systematic rape, forced recruitment of boys as soldiers and girls as sex slaves \u2013 it should all be happening in Rwanda. The reason it isn't is that Paul Kagame, the president of Rwanda, has managed to build a security-oriented state that allows Rwandans to live in peace.</p> <p>Many outsiders find the Congo war, with its baffling array of factions and staggering human toll \u2013 3 or 4 million deaths over the last decade \u2013 almost impossible to understand. But understanding it becomes much easier when it is placed in its Rwandan context.</p> <p>Over a 100-day period in mid-1994, murderers loyal to the Hutu-dominated government of Rwanda slaughtered about 1 million of their Tutsi neighbours. After Kagame's rebel movement overthrew that government, the killers fled into a safe zone created by France, which was the genocidal regime's close ally. France then arranged for the defeated army and its mass of civilian accomplices \u2013 more than a million people \u2013 to cross into eastern Congo, along with their artillery pieces, helicopters and other heavy weaponry.</p> <p>Over the next few years, gangs of genocidaires crossed back repeatedly into Rwanda, waging a brutal insurgency aimed at retaking power so they could complete the genocide. The Rwandan army, led by Kagame, ruthlessly crushed this insurgency. Rwandan forces then invaded Congo twice, killing many genocidaires and overthrowing Mobutu Sese Seko, the Congolese president and monster who had embraced their cause.</p> <p>But the genocidal force, now called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Forces_for_the_Liberation_of_Rwanda\">Forces Democratiques de Liberation du Rwanda</a>, or FDLR, was not destroyed. Unable to push into Rwanda and kill Tutsi there, it <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/world/2008/may/16/congo.rwanda\">decided to wage war in eastern Congo</a>. Many Tutsi also live there, and they are the victims of a new genocide in the making.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, this effort to wipe out Congolese Tutsi has provoked a response. A former general in the Congolese army who is of Tutsi descent, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/30/congo1\">Laurent Nkunda</a>, has raised an army to fight the genocidaires and try to prevent the extermination of his people. This conflict is at the heart of what is happening in the long-suffering Congolese provinces of North and South Kivu.</p> <p>Nkunda's army has itself been accused of atrocities, and given the record of rampaging warlords in eastern Congo, that accusation is almost certainly true. More intriguing is the charge that Nkunda is receiving secret support from Kagame and his Tutsi-led government in Rwanda. Kagame denies this, but when he sent troops into Congo in 1996 he also denied he was doing it, only to confess after victory a couple of years later.</p> <p>There are several good reasons why Kagame's government would want to help Nkunda. First, Nkunda is trying to stop the slaughter of Kagame's ethnic Tutsi cousins in Congo. Second, his troops are killing fighters whose ultimate aim is to invade Rwanda and wipe out the Tutsi population there. Third, a victory by Nkunda might allow him to establish a buffer zone inside Congo that would make a genocidaire invasion of Rwanda more difficult.</p> <p>Another reason cannot be ignored. Eastern Congo is one of the most resource-rich regions in the world. For more than a century, kings, presidents, gangsters, warlords, business tycoons and others have understood that control of this region brings the prospect of great wealth. That too is one of the factors fuelling this war. If there were no gold or diamonds in eastern Congo, or if companies like Microsoft and Hitachi were not so desperate for the \"grey gold\" known as coltan, a key component in cell phones and other electronic devices that is plentiful in this region, controlling it would not be so appealing.</p> <p>Under Kagame's authoritarian rule, Rwanda has become one of the most promising countries in Africa. All it would take to destroy the progress Rwanda has made over the last decade would be a handful of successful cross-border attacks by genocidaires. Kagame knows this, and he is not the sort of person to allow the niceties of international law to prevent him from aggressively defending Rwanda's security. Supporting a friendly warlord in Congo might be the best way for him to do that. If that warlord establishes control over a territory full of riches, so much the better for them both.</p> <p>One intriguing question remains: Would Nkunda's capture of eastern Congo and its main town, Goma, bring <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/31/congo-unitednations\">a measure of peace</a> to the region? If so, regardless of what else it would mean, it would be a godsend.</p>",

The congresswoman from Toledo, now running for her fourteenth term, has a deserved reputation as a maverick - moderate on some issues, liberal to radical on others - who takes no prisoners when she speaks her mind. She is known as a friend to labour unions and a leader in the fight against Nafta and other free-trade initiatives, which have hit hard in industrial areas such as her north-west Ohio district. Both the unemployment rate and the home foreclosure rate in Toledo are well above the national average.</p> <p>Kaptur became something of a YouTube folk hero in September when she took to the floor of the Congress for a series of fiery speeches denouncing the proposed taxpayer-funded bailout of \"Wall Street's big banking boys.\" These \"plunderers of our economy\", <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbD62gNi9WE\">she declared</a>, were \"now are running home to mama\" for government help. \"They want mama to make it all better.\" As the bill was hammered out, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\" oaadyc6t4ny\"\">Kaptur protested</a> that \"only a few insiders\" were making the deal and ramming it through Congress without the usual committee proceedings, hearings or review. \"These criminals have so much political power they can shut down the normal legislative process of the highest law making body of this land,\" she said. \"We are constitutionally sworn to protect and defend this republic against all enemies foreign and domestic. And my friends, there are enemies.\"</p> <p>Kaptur was very rushed the day we met her, and her press aide hit upon the Union Club, where the congresswoman had a business meeting scheduled for later in the afternoon as a place to meet. It was an incongruous setting.The club dates from the late 19th century, when the burgeoning city of Cleveland sat astride rail corridors and waterways that connected the eastern United States to the industrialising north and the resource-rich west. John D Rockefeller built the Standard Oil Company from Cleveland, and Rockefellers numbered among the club's early members - as did five presidents (Taft, Grant, Hayes, Garfield, and McKinley), six senators and two supreme court justices.</p> <p>It was cold and windy when the Road to the White House senior producer Kate O'Callaghan and I strode up the steps to the club and entered its elegant lobby. A staff member who could only be described as a butler approached us, and we told him we had an appointment with Marcy Kaptur. \"I am sorry,\" he said, looking at O'Callaghan, his upper lip slightly curled. \"You will have to go.\"</p> <p>\"Go?\" we asked. \"Leave,\" he replied firmly. Women wearing jeans, he informed us, were not allowed in the club. \"Believe me, she won't be the first woman asked to go,\" he continued. \"The club has its rules. There is nothing to be done.\"</p> <p>\"But we are to meet a member of the United States Congress,\" I said. \"What if she takes her coat off and ties it around her waist as if it were a dress.\" The butler shook his head. He was steering us towards the door.</p> <p>Suddenly, a cheery man appeared and announced that he was Kaptur's press aide. He and the butler consulted. The butler disappeared, then returned and ushered us to an elevator. \"Second floor, end of the corridor. There is a small room to the side where business is conducted,\" he said.</p> <p>It was against this strange background that we interviewed the no-nonsense Kaptur, who grew up in Toledo in a Polish Catholic working-class family, and has her own definite ideas about what should be done for the failing economy. She believes that the government should immediately sit down with borrowers and work out the delinquent loans, stretching them out at a lower interest rate. An emergency session of Congress should be called after the election to enact legislation, much of it modeled after the New Deal. The new government must waste no time in priming the economic pump by creating jobs. Kaptur hoped that, if elected, Obama would bring significant change for the better, but she was plainly skeptical.</p> <p>The conversation turned to Joseph Wurzelbacher - the now-famous Joe the Plumber - who happens to live down the road from the congresswoman. Nobody in her community, she told us, seemed to know who he was. \"I wonder,\" she said, \"if they put him there because of me. Do they really think like that? Who would have thought?\"</p> <p>In fact, just a few days earlier, Wurzelbacher had told several right-wing news outlets that he was <a href=\"http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/10/25/joe-plumber-considers-run-congress/\">considering a run for Congress</a> - in Kaptur's district, of course. \"I'll tell you what,\" he said on one talkshow, \"we'd definitely be in one heck of a fight, but you know, I'd be up for it.\" <br> Without a doubt, Marcy Kaptur would be up for it too.</p>",
  "<p>The Emperor Scrumptious was born in 35 BC, and died on his birthday in AD 35. What was his age when he died? This is a trick question, from a dizzying new book called Professor Stewart's Cabinet of Mathematical Curiosities (Profile, \u00a310.99) and I mention it because a variation of the same question was put to the broadcaster John Humphrys on Radio 4's Today Programme. </p> <p>It was put by the mathematician Marcus du Sautoy, who had just been appointed the new Charles Simonyi professor of the public understanding of science at Oxford. Humphrys deliberately provoked the challenge, and then failed it, because of course he had forgotten, or had never known, that there had been no Year Zero in the switch from the ancient to the modern calendar. </p> <p>The annual countdown jumped directly from 1BC to AD1, not because the ancients didn't understand maths \u2013 they invented it - but because there was in Europe then, and for many centuries afterwards, no mathematical concept of zero. </p> <p>At the time, the question didn't seem to have much to do with science, but this conclusion is probably quite wrong. Mathematics is about number, measure, pattern, probability and proof: it is rationalism's ultimate defence. </p> <p>Plato thought God was a geometer, but the author of the books of Moses also seemed to understand that God did things by numbers. </p> <p>Mathematics is the secret language of the universe, in senses that most of us never appreciate: Van Gogh's Sunflowers, and Caravaggio's Supper at Emmaus aren't just expressions of Fibonacci numbers or the Golden Section, they work their magic because each is at bottom the experience of a precise set of wavelengths of visible light reflected from mineral surfaces chosen for their unique optical properties, received by a retina and converted to energy and information along an optic nerve and then assembled by that astonishing virtual reality headset called the brain. </p> <p>You can enjoy art without knowing these things, but if you ever wanted to understand why a great painting \u2013 an almost flat surface smeared with glue, oil, soot and crushed stone \u2013 packs such power, then you might end up using numbers, measure, pattern and proof. The same goes for all science, from archaeology to zoology, not excluding climate research, immunology and cancer chemotherapy. </p> <p>In principle, a mathematician starts with a handicap: what science is he an expert in the public understanding of? In practice, that won't be a disadvantage. That is because public understanding is a pretty loose concept, and the public understanding of science is even more deliciously imprecise. </p> <p>The role for a professor of the public understanding of science is even more of a puzzle, partly because as an academic post, it is hardly older than the average undergraduate, and partly because although there is clearly a public need to be met, there may not be an obvious public demand. </p> <p>Members of the public who want to understand chemistry or physics could enrol in university courses in these subjects. And as we know, there are fewer of these, because of falling demand. </p> <p>So although plenty of people may be interested in the large hadron collider, or the antioxidant properties or red wine and broccoli, or the possibility of life on Mars, there is no compelling evidence that anyone wants to know about science as such. That is challenge number one for Marcus du Sautoy. Like his predecessor, Richard Dawkins, he will have to create his own audience.</p> <p>The second challenge is more considerable. It is fair to say that what the general public doesn't know about science is epic. The first scholar to take up the title did so after a 1988 survey that asked people if they were interested in science (yes, they were!) and wanted more and better science communication (they certainly did!) and then: does the sun go round the Earth, or does the Earth go round the sun? The next question was: how long does it take? One in three failed the first question. Two out of three failed the second. <br> Since modern science began with these questions, addressed 400 years ago by Copernicus, and since modern science has advanced on so many fronts at such bewildering speed that many scientists cannot keep up with their own fields, let alone all science, it seems fair to say that the public understanding of science remains a tricky little number, for anyone: metallurgist, meteorologist or mathematician. </p> <p>And yet a mathematician might just be better placed to make his voice heard and his arguments count when it comes to getting people interested in science. </p> <p>He will in theory know no more about endocrinology or oceanography than his listeners. That is a good thing: he will know what questions to ask, and which explanations won't work. But he will understand why some things are reasonable, and others irrational, why some answers can be precise, why others will always involve a touch of uncertainty, and why some propositions are absurd. </p> <p>We began with mathematics in history. Let us end with another corker from Ian Stewart's new book. The state legislature of Indiana is supposed (it's a myth) to have passed a law declaring the precise value of pi, that exasperatingly imprecise number. </p> <p>But, Stewart points out, if you had a legal truth that was different from a mathematical truth, you could play some very interesting games. You could prove, with two simple equations, that 1=0. \"Therefore all murderers have a cast-iron defence: admit to one murder, then argue legally that it is zero murders,\" says Professor Stewart. \"And that's not the last of it. Multiply by one billion, to deduce that one billion equals zero. Now any citizen apprehended in possession of no drugs is in possession of drugs to a street value of $1 billion. In fact, any statement whatsoever would become legally provable.\"</p>",

  "<p>A special effects technician was killed shooting a stunt for Batman sequel The Dark Knight, an inquest heard today.</p> <p>Conway Wickliffe, 41, was riding in the back seat of a Nissan 4x4 when the car crashed into a tree at 20mph. He had been leaning out of the window and operating a camera, which was shooting a stunt car travelling parallel to his vehicle.</p> <p>The father-of-two, originally from New Zealand, suffered severe injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene at the QinetiQ site at Longcross near Chertsey, Surrey.</p> <p>A jury sitting at Woking Coroners Court for the two-day inquest heard that a crew were filming a test run for a scene in which the Batmobile is blown up. The Nissan, driven by another special effects technician, Bruce Monroe-Armstrong, failed to make the 90 degree turn required at the end of its run, and hit a tree. </p> <p>Ian Lowe, prep supervisor for the stunt, told the inquest that the rest of the crew thought it had gone according to plan until \"Bruce came running around the corner\". A fellow crew member, Ian Mitchell, said he watched the 4x4 reach the end of the run but carry on into the grass.</p> <p>He added: \"Instead of turning on to the service road it carried on and I saw it impact the tree. It appeared to be a glancing blow.\" He said he ran over and found Wickliffe \"in a bad way\". </p> <p>Wickliffe was an experienced stunt technician who had worked on a string of big budget hits, including Batman Begins, Children of Men and the James Bond films Casino Royale and Die Another Day. He was commemorated in the closing credits of The Dark Knight, which read: \"In memory of our friends Heath Ledger and Conway Wickliffe\".</p> <p>Wickliffe's death was the first in a number of incidents that led to talk of a so-called \"Curse of Batman\". Heath Ledger, 28, who played The Joker in the film, died of an accidental drugs overdose in January, shortly after filming was completed.

Daniel Craig and Olga Kurylenko in Quantum of Solace</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Audiences gave Daniel Craig's second outing as Bond a resounding thumbs up at the weekend, as Marc Forster's film opened to an incredible \u00a315.4m at the UK box office - the biggest weekend debut of all time. </p> <p>Critics have also warmed to the new movie, with most handing the lion's share of their praise to Daniel Craig for a lean, musclebound performance that continues to redefine 007 for the modern era. Some are quick to point out, however, that the film suffers without the Ian Fleming source material that enriched its predecessor, Casino Royale. Occasionally, there is the odd complaint that Craig's new Bond isn't as much fun as his forebears, but most critics seem to accept that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2008/oct/30/james-bond-quantum-of-solace\">cocktail Bond, as my colleague Paul MacInnes recently labelled him</a>, has sipped his last martini.</p> <p>\"For a lot of the movie Bond is a particularly unsympathetic character, and often it's only Craig's performance along with the shifting morality of Bond's legion of enemies that forces the audience to root for him,\" <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7676637.stm\">writes the BBC's Lizo Mzimba</a>. </p> <p>\"The raw nature of the film may put off some who yearn for the days of gizmos, gadgets and Bond quips as he dispenses with faceless opponents. And it's a brave step to push even further a lot of the themes developed in Casino Royale, especially the rediscovery of who Bond is, and why he is the way he is. It's a film that feels like the second part of a trilogy, with this being the bleaker second act.\" </p> <p>\"The meanest and leanest James Bond film yet, Quantum of Solace is a breathless splash of high-speed action that hurtles from one reckless chase to another,\" <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film/reviews/article_display.jsp?JSESSIONID=CLMBJCDp7hp4QNDxD1y2VJKchx2nJ38dMmvCb1QJq2VyLGjJBddZ!820052645&amp;&amp;rid=11864\">writes The Hollywood Reporter's Ray Bennett</a>. </p> <p>\"There's not much solace and few words as the British secret agent exercises his license to kill in dispatching one bad guy after another in the attempt to avenge the death of the lover who died in Casino Royale. Fans of that boxoffice smash and the earlier films might be disappointed that the new picture allows hardly any flourishes of style and character in the 007 tradition, but moviegoers seeking an adrenaline rush will be well pleased.\"</p> <p>\"So much dash, flash and thrill \u2013 so many boat chases, tight rope-dangling fight scenes, bi-plane dogfights, architectural flourishes and flat-table computer displays \u2013 there's scant time left for character, let alone, story, fun, seduction, humour or wit,\" <a href=\"http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/85686/quantum-of-solace.html \">writes Time Out's Wally Hammond</a>. \"You can sense the older, traditionalist viewers wanting to go home early to take their nostalgia pills.</p> <p>\"Can't we sneak in the odd moment for some occasional quiet conversation, maybe even a leisurely martini or a game of baccarat, even if we can't afford luxury rail travel or \u2013 God forbid \u2013 some protracted, guiltless sex? Go on, Bond, next time, indulge yourself a little more. We like to watch.\"</p> <p>\"I have to confess that this second Bond adventure disappointed me a little,\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/oct/31/quantum-of-solace\">writes our own Peter Bradshaw</a>. \"It's not nearly as smart as Craig's debut. There is not much storyline or romance - although there is some hotel-suite action with a sexy British agent called Fields, played by Gemma Arterton, who greets Bond at the airport apparently wearing nothing but a raincoat, like some sort of MI6 stripogram.</p> <p>\"Quantum of Solace isn't bad, but from now on, Craig's Bond has to be a real character with something real at stake, however absurd. Otherwise we're going to return to the franchise production line. That would be an awful shame.\"</p> <p>I'd have to agree that Quantum of Solace, while an excellent addition to the Bond canon, isn't quite up there with Casino Royale. But I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a disappointment, and I think that the producers should be congratulated for intelligently matching their Bond (Craig) to his subject matter. </p> <p>The blue-eyed Englishman's success in the role has led some to wonder why the most recent actor to play Bond seriously, the ill-fated Timothy Dalton, failed to make a similar mark. For a clue, <a href=\" http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19870731/REVIEWS/707310304/1023\">check out this Roger Ebert review of 1987's The Living Daylights</a>. It highlights what Eon productions got wrong back then and have got so very right this time around: if you're going to reinvent Bond, reinvent everything. Don't just shoehorn a more serious actor into a traditionally cheesy plot; make sure the entire world that Bond inhabits fits a more realistic take on the character. That's what Casino Royale started and what Quantum of Solace continues, and it's why I'll be looking forward to the next instalment of 007's adventures with bated breath.</p> <p>How about you?

There is a ceasefire, but that ceasefire could break. There's still a real need for other countries to keep piling on the diplomatic pressure.\"</p> <p>People living in banana leaf and tarpaulin shelters inside the camp had spoken mainly of wanting an end to the violence, said Wynn, whose organisation has four foreign and about 40 local staff in Goma, plus others elsewhere around the country.</p> <p>\"There is a need for aid, but moreso for security. People are telling us, 'we want to go home',\" she said.</p> <p>Anjali Kwatra, of ActionAid, said the organisation was resuming work around Goma after ceasing activities last week as the situation spiraled \"out of control\".</p> <p>\"Things seem to be getting calmer but we are relying on the UN's advice on security,\" she said.</p> <p>\"If it stays calmer then we have the people in place, we have supplies in the warehouses. We can get it out to people in Goma and camps around the city pretty quickly, but it all depends on the security situation. There are a lot of people who need help.\"</p> <p>Security remains key, said Louise Orton from another UK-based aid agency, Merlin.</p> <p>\"For us, access is really important, that we can get our health workers out there to deliver the help,\" she told BBC News 24.</p>",
  "<p>The revelation that students at the country's most prestigious seats of learning enjoy an occasional joint is hardly the stuff of headlines - unless that country is Japan.</p> <p>Judging by recent coverage, Japan is in the midst of a marijuana epidemic that is ensnaring everyone from students to suburban housewives and sumo wrestlers.</p> <p>A slew of arrests for drug-related offences among elite scholars has sparked widespread indignation that more youngsters are choosing to while away their university years in a fug of marijuana smoke.</p> <p>While police once focused their attention on amphetamines and other stimulants, recent statistics show a dramatic increase in cases involving cannabis. In the first half of this year the number of cases in which suspects were questioned or arrested stood at 1,202, a 12% increase on the same time last year. The number of cases involving the cultivation of cannabis at home was up by almost 50%, the national police agency said.</p> <p>A record 2,423 violations were recorded in 2006, but police expect that figure to be beaten with ease this year.</p> <p>Recreational marijuana use hit the headlines this summer when three Russian sumo wrestlers were kicked out of the sport for allegedly smoking the drug. In recent months newspapers have reported arrests for dealing, cultivating or possessing marijuana at some of Japan's best universities.</p> <p>Daytime TV shows, meanwhile, blame foreign suppliers for corrupting gullible Japanese teenagers and, increasingly, bored housewives, as they move out heavily policed city centres into the suburbs.</p> <p>The Mainichi Shimbun, often a progressive voice on other issues, devoted part of its front page yesterday to a fuming editorial warning of the potential ruination of Japan's finest universities by the evil weed.</p> <p>Noting that students of the 1960s concerned themselves only with \"world peace\", the paper derided their modern-day counterparts' unhealthy obsession with attaining a different kind of tranquility.</p> <p>Of the recent campus arrests, it says: \"It is rational to believe that these cases are just the tip of the iceberg, and that 'drug pollution' at university campuses is more widespread than generally thought.\"</p> <p>There does not appear to be a problem with supply. In July, police in Tokyo seized 180kg of cannabis - Japan's biggest haul - with a street value of \u00a5720m (\u00a34.6m).</p> <p>Smokers who prefer not to risk buying from dealers - who charge, on average, six times the going rate in the Netherlands - are growing their own. Accordingly, the number of people arrested for growing the plant at home, many with seeds bought on the internet, has risen fivefold over the past 10 years.</p> <p>Japanese law takes a dim view of the recreational use of soft drugs. The 1948 cannabis control law calls for prison terms of up to 10 years and hefty fine for anyone found importing, exporting, growing, selling or buying cannabis.</p> <p>Its use for medical purposes, permitted in some other countries, is also banned.</p> <p>Japanese activists are pushing for a change in the law to permit the use of cannabis among sufferers of diseases such as cancer, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's.</p> <p>\"Cannabis is harmless compared to alcohol and tobaccos, but still the government overreacts and ruins the lives of anyone found with it,\" Koichi Maeda, the founder of the Japan Medical Marijuana Association, told the Guardian. \"We asked the government to provide evidence of the harm they say marijuana causes, but they couldn't.\"</p> <p>Maeda, who runs a hemp restaurant in Tokyo, believes recent media coverage of the issue shows how far public attitudes towards dope smoking in Japan lag behind those in Britain and parts of Europe.</p> <p>\"The authorities use the media to peddle their claims that marijuana is a gateway drug to harder substances, and the media are too stupid to check if what they are being told is true,\" he said. \"All the newspapers do is run sensationalist articles based on what the police tell them. It makes me so angry.</p>",

Microsoft, one senses, wouldn't have minded that, as it sold a staggering 5 million units.</p> <p>Its successor, <a href=\"http://gearsofwar.xbox.com/\">Gears of War 2</a>, arrives in a different climate. The Xbox 360 is a great success, and Microsoft is assiduously pushing the console at a more mainstream audience. Nevertheless, Gears of War 2 is its biggest gun this Christmas. So will it repeat its predecessor's success \u2013 and even make inroads beyond the hardcore faithful?</p> <p>Yes is definitely the answer to the first question, while it may just have the ammunition to get some of those casual gamers hooked on something a bit stronger. Mike Capps, president of <a href=\"http://www.epicgames.com/\">Gears of War 2 developer Epic</a>, pinpoints three areas in which the new offering improves on its predecessor: the ability for two people to play co-operatively with different difficulty-level settings, including one catering for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/casualgaming\">super-casual gamers</a> (\"We tried to make something this time that when your <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/womenandgaming\">girlfriend</a> plays it in co-op with you, she'll enjoy it too\"); a much better storyline (\"This is the space in which we stepped up \u2013 we're not afraid to say it's almost a love-movie\"); and a new \"party system\" easing the process of setting up online games with your mates (\"It's so easy to get two or three of your friends, play for four hours in Gears of War 2 and have fun, and who cares that you're all on different servers on the internet?\").</p> <p>That may not sound revolutionary, but the end result is mighty impressive. We're a tiny bit sceptical about the new super-easy difficulty level: it makes you much more difficult to kill, while the fearsome Locust enemy succumb to a few bullets whereas normally they don't drop until they've been foiled with a large quantity of lead. It rather goes against what Gears of War 2 is all about, although it will open the co-op mode to those who have never played a proper shooter. Capps betrays a lack of enthusiasm for it when he says: \"It's better to play with you than to watch you play it,\" and at least it means the Gears of War franchise can no longer be criticised for being socially exclusive.</p> <p>Epic's concentration on the storyline pays big dividends, though: Gears of War 2's single-player game is vastly more three-dimensional, varied and involving than that its rather one-paced predecessor, which consisted predominantly of vast amounts of corridor shooting punctuated by the odd boss-battle or vehicle-based gameplay. Gears of War 2 mixes things up to great effect: right at the start of a game you find yourself manning a fixed gun in a convoy of huge troop-carriers, but later you encounter a gloriously squishy sequence in which you have to hack your way out of the belly of a stone worm so giant its burrows cause entire cities to collapse into the ground. Even when you're inside, you often have to, for example, solve puzzles disabling security systems, and there's some surprisingly good sniping to be done. The storyline, involving protagonist Marcus Fenix's mate Dom's search for his missing girlfriend, the origins of the Locust, the progress of rookie Carmine and the fate of the tattooed Tai adds a certain amount of emotional involvement thoroughly lacking in the original.</p> <p>The visceral, full-on gameplay that made the original such a success is largely unchanged, although there are new enemies such as the exploding Nemacyst (essentially mobile mines) and the quasi-religious Kantus, and the odd new weapon, most notably a mortar. It's very much a case of not fixing something that was never broke, but the enemy AI is noticeably subtler, and it's more important to tailor your tactical approach to each different enemy you face.</p> <p>But where Gears of War 2 really eclipses its predecessor is in the multiplayer side. Quite simply, it will take Xbox Live by storm. Especially with the new Horde mode in which, rather than \"worrying about how tough some random kid on the internet is\", as Capps puts it, you and up to four of your mates have to see how long you can survive in the face of an onslaught of wave after wave of increasingly fearsome Locust. The Horde really captures the \"you and your mates fighting to save the world from terrifying aliens\" essence of Gears of War.</p> <p>Two other new multiplayer modes stand out: Wingman, in which you find a partner and take on other teams of two players until the last man is standing; and Submission (which Epic wanted to call \"Meatflag\" but Microsoft wouldn't let it), which is a capture-the-flag game, except that each side has one player designated as the \"flag\", who must first be killed and then carried back to your base.</p> <p>Gears of War 2 should be just as successful as its predecessor: even if it doesn't feel like it's pushing the envelope as much, it is a far superior game. It remains to be seen whether it will be the game to take those casual gamers who have graduated from the Wii and herd them onto the path to hardcore. But there are an awful lot more Xbox 360s out there than there were two years ago, so we reckon it will have no trouble outselling the original Gears of War.</p>",
  "<p>When discussing the Senate races in the United States this year, one question looms large on the mind of any political analyst or junkie. Namely, will the Democrats or won't they? Get to 60 votes, that is.</p> <p>The figure 60 is \u2013 outside of gaining a simple majority (of 51 votes) \u2013 the second-most important number to shoot for in the Senate. This is because a procedure known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster\">filibuster</a>, in the past used when the minority found legislation so offensive that they were willing to get up and talk, talk and talk some more, is now employed by Republican minority leader and legislation constipator Mitch McConnell more often than Sarah Palin can say \"You betcha!\". To stop this verbal assault requires a \"supermajority\" or 60 votes. Hence, it is a magic number of sorts.</p> <p>When this election season began, prognosticators of all stripes believed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">economic malaise</a>, an unpopular war in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq\">Iraq</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgebush\">Republican president</a> in the White House with an approval rating on par with scurvy, made Democratic pickups the most likely outcome. When five Republican senators decided to retire and Democrats raised a lot more money than their Republican counterparts, Democratic chances were only enhanced. And every day brings seemingly worse news for the GOP.</p> <p>Currently, short of a damaging event on the level of a natural disaster \u2013 or a public endorsement by Madonna \u2013 Democrats are poised to gain at least six seats. Right now, in Virginia, New Mexico, Colorado, New Hampshire, Alaska and Oregon the die has been cast. As Democrats effectively now have 51 seats in the senate (by including the two independents who caucus with the Democrats \u2013 Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Bernie Sanders of Vermont), that would mean they need three more to get to 60. Currently, comedian Al Franken is slightly ahead of Republican incumbent and used-car salesman impersonator Norm Coleman in Minnesota, and the Democrats are also in position to beat former Republican cabinet member and wife of 1996 GOP presidential candidate Bob Dole, North Carolina Senator Liddy Dole. That gets you to 59.</p> <p>Yet, in three more races in the South \u2013 Mississippi, Georgia and Kentucky (McConnell's seat) \u2013 the polls show a dead heat. Meanwhile in Maine, Democrat Tom Allen is gaining on election-year moderate Susan Collins. In the Georgia race, as a special bonus, if nobody gets 50% (quite likely with a Libertarian candidate also running), then a runoff will be set for a month later, or the beginning of December.</p> <p>So if you think all the drama might be done election night, just imagine one more month of fun, especially if the Democrats are standing at 59 seats on November 5. This would prove my theory, which is that American electioneering never does in fact end. </p> <p>In any case, November 4 should be a very good night for the Democrats. And Republicans? Well, they may find themselves looking up the definition of <a href=\"http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Hari-kiri\">hari-kiri</a>.</p>",

One firearms officer said the Brazilian moved towards him with apparent aggressive intent, making him fear that the electrician was about to detonate a bomb.</p> <p>Dunwoodie disputed this. She said the police appeared to be panicking and were \"shouting amongst themselves\".</p> <p>\"I think it was the man, who I now know to be a surveillance officer, [who] really seemed to be frightened or hyped up and when he was calling the other men they seemed ... you know, when people are full of adrenalin and they move quickly and their movements are a bit jerky,\" she told the inquest at Oval cricket ground, south London.</p> <p>\"I felt they were a bit out of control, that's what it felt like.\"</p> <p>De Menezes showed little reaction when the police boarded the train, Dunwoodie said. \"It was sort of a scrum. I remember the man holding the gun out. His [De Menezes's] eyes were closed and he looked almost calm, although I hesitate to say that.</p> <p>\"I guess he had a gun pressed to his head and there was not anything he could do about it. The first shots came very suddenly and my first thoughts were that it was someone firing a stun gun. There was a break and it was my memory that there were more shots.\"</p> <p>Two other witnesses who were sitting near carriage doors said they had no recollection of any warnings from the police. Robert Preston said he only heard police shouting \"get down, get down\". </p> <p>\"It was quite a general statement and it could have applied to me,\" he said.</p> <p>Mark Whitby, a fellow passenger, added: \"'Get down, get down.' That's all I heard. There was not one mention of armed police.\"<br></p>",

RealPlayer provides two of the top five entries, and Apple's QuickTime provides one. AOL SuperBuddy also makes the top 10.</p> <p>Vista contrasts with Windows XP, where half the top 10 security problems are Microsoft vulnerabilities, according to <a href=\"http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=10639\">graphics published at ZD Net</a>. The key security fixes to install are <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-014.mspx\">MS06-014</a> (which is by far the most important), MS06-057, MS06-067 and MS06-055. With XP, Apple QuickTime and RealPlayer also feature in the top five vulnerabilities, and WinZip makes the top 10.</p> <p>Third-party vulnerabilities are targeted by 94% of the browser-based attacks on Vista, and 58% of the attacks on XP.<br><br>It's important to note that <em>there are no unpatched insecurities in QuickTime, according to <a href=\"http://secunia.com/advisories/product/5090/\">Secunia</a></em>, and only one \"less critical\" inseurity in <a href=\"http://secunia.com/advisories/product/2968/\">RealPlayer 10.x</a>. Whether you can increase your security by uninstalling these particular programs, rather than updating them, is open to doubt. (I uninstalled QuickTime because of its many annoying attempts to sneak itself into my start-up sequence, and its mediocre performance. However, I'm lucky enough not to own an iPod: Apple installs QuickTime along with iTunes.) </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/03/technology/companies/03security.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;oref=slogin\">The New York Times story</a> says:</p> <blockquote> <p>The company said improvements in security for its Windows Vista operating system and security updates to the previous Windows XP system had made such software a less attractive target for attackers. Instead, they have shifted their attention to security holes in individual programs. <br>During the first half of the year, 90% of newly reported vulnerabilities involved applications, and only 10% affected operating systems, according to the report. </p> </blockquote> <p>The story also highlights geographical variations:</p> <blockquote> <p>The current report indicates that malware infection rates are generally higher in developing countries and regions than in developed ones. Infection rates range from 1.8 for every 1,000 computers in Japan to above 76.4 for every 1,000 in Afghanistan. The United States had an infection rate of 11.2 infected computers for every 1,000 scanned, an increase of 25.5% in the last six months. </p> </blockquote> <p>Clearly it's important to install security updates for third-party applications, and to have Windows Update picking up patches. Fact is, the most-exploited vulnerability in XP was <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-014.mspx\">fixed in April 2006</a>, which is 2.5 years ago. If people are still getting Trojan downloads via this flaw, whose fault is it? </p> <p>You can check if your PC's patches are up to date by running a scan at Secunia:<br><a href=\"http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/\">http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/</a> </p> <p>I just ran the desktop version, Personal Software Inspector, and it found eight insecurities in: WinAMP 2.x, ZoneAlarm 6.x, Adobe Flash Player 9.x (General Plug-in), Sun Java JRE 1.6.x / 6.x (two), VLC media player 0.x, WinRAR 3.x andWinZip 9.x, giving me a system score of 93%. PSI provides links to download new versions. Oddly, I don't have ZoneAlarm or WinZip installed, so it may be finding old downloads.</p> <p><strong>Update</strong>: It was finding a backup of my son's previous laptop, stowed away on an external hard drive.</p>",
  "<p>Tomorrow, MPs have the chance to strike a blow for social justice and represent society's abhorrence of racism and fascism. Amendments to the employment bill <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/nov/02/trade-unions-bnp-far-right\">are coming before the Commons</a> to restore to trade unions some of the rights lost during the long years of the Thatcher-neoliberal consensus (remember that?).</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/Reinstate18/\">The central amendment</a>, backed by the trade union group of MPs and the campaigning anti-fascist magazine Searchlight, seeks to reverse a decision in the Lords that restricts the right of unions to exclude or expel active fascists from our ranks.</p> <p>The European court of human rights has found that the 1992 Tory <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1992/ukpga_19920052_en_1\">trade union and labour relations act</a> is in violation of the right to freedom of association under the European convention on human rights. Workers should be free to join a trade union without sanction, and so too should the trade union be free to choose its own members. </p> <p>This amendment is vital if unions are to be able to exclude British National Party activists and other active racists from membership. As the economy slides into recession, experience teaches us that racists will most likely step up their activities and try and blame social problems on migrants or black people generally.</p> <p>Trade unions are a bulwark against this poison. Our aim is to fight for social justice for all working people in unity. We will resist any effort to set workers against each other.</p> <p>That is why active support for fascists and racists is, and should be, incompatible with trade union membership. Trade unions should be free to use their own democratic procedures, without state interference, to control the right to membership. Amendment NC6 will simply repeal Section 174 of the 1992 act, giving trade unions back their right to act against active racists and ensuring that UK law is in compliance with European standards.</p> <p>Other amendments are scarcely less important if the industrial relations playing field is at long last to have a semblance of balance. Currently, the duties placed on trade unions to provide employers with notice of ballots and industrial action place are onerous, costly and excessively complicated. They expose unions to applications for injunctions by employers to prevent industrial action taking place, even where a clear majority have voted to support the action. A new clause will introduce greater fairness by cutting the \"red tape\" that unions face. Employers would be required to supply trade unions with information they need to comply with notice and balloting requirements. </p> <p>All workers should also be protected from suffering detriment or being sued as a result of their taking part in industrial action, other than appropriate deductions from the worker's wages. A further amendment will mean that all workers have the right to take official industrial action free from the fear of dismissal or victimisation.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm\">International Labour Organisation</a> has repeatedly found that UK law is in breach of international human rights treaties by failing to provide this protection. The effect of one amendment would be to establish that dismissals made in anticipation of, during or after lawful industrial action would be void unless the employer can show that the reason for the dismissal was unconnected. </p> <p>Regulation currently bars employment agencies from supplying agency workers to carry out duties normally performed by a worker undertaking lawful strike action. A loophole in the law, however, means that this duty does not apply if the agency does not know that the agency worker is replacing a worker taking industrial action. A further amendment would close this loophole. </p> <p>These are all modest measures, which perhaps, now that the days of deregulation as a panacea are past, MPs can finally adopt.</p>",
  "<p>Here's <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=a98690e8-d6b0-44fa-a3f0-c76414c3c9da\">a really important story</a> from Sahil Mahtani in The New Republic on the question of whether John McCain illegally leaked negative information about some fellow senators back during the Keating Five investigation.</p> <p>I know, the election seems close to a done deal, what's the need for more dirt on McCain, etc. But please believe me. Election entirely aside, <em>you need to click through the above link and read this</em>. It will tell you quite a lot about the man. Bottom line? In all likelihood, he should have been kicked out of the Senate back in 1991.</p> <p>The short version is this: The Senate Ethics Committee was probing the Keating matter. Suddenly, stories from anonymous sources started appearing in some newspapers. Interestingly, these stories all tended to exonerate McCain and suggest greater culpability on the part of the four other senators.</p> <p>Suspicions arose. The Senate ordered a probe into the leaks \u2013 leaks about senators whose careers are possibly on the line are something other senators tend to take very seriously. McCain swore, under oath, that he was not the source of the leaks. Lying under oath, of course, is a crime: perjury.</p> <p>No smoking gun was ever found, so McCain was able to scoot away. But the chief investigator of the internal probe \u2013 as well as others who were familiar with the situation \u2013 believe to this day that McCain was the leaker:</p> <blockquote> <p>Finally, there are Hall's reflections on the leaks today: \"When you look at these stories, you interview the people--I must have interviewed 50-60 people, and I didn't have one single person defend McCain. If and when they pointed, they pointed in his direction.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Remember, McCain was in his first term. He was by several accounts panicked that his career was about to end. Already then, he wanted to be president. That he would have done whatever he needed to do to save his skin is not farfetched. </p> <p>An ironic note as well, which tells us something about Washington and our media culture. This was also around the time that McCain held his famous \"mea culpa\" press conference, in which he seemingly exhaustively answered all media questions about the Keating matter. The \"golly gee, John McCain is so open and accessible to the press\" narrative got its start there. </p> <p>At the same time he was being open and accessible and playing the violin of contrition and self-abasement in front of some gullible reporters, however, he was also in all likelihood spoon-feeding other reporters negative information about four of his colleagues so as to save his own ass. Now that's character, no? I hope he still has nightmares about Dennis DeConcini.</p> <p>Mahtani \u2013 Bravo! Let us be rid of this man once and for all, please.<br></p>",
  "<p>Campaigners have expressed concern about the potential misuse of new powers for the compulsory treatment of people with mental illness that come into force in England today.</p> <p>Under changes to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/mentalhealth\">mental health</a> legislation, some patients discharged from hospital may be placed under a community treatment order (CTO) that forces them to take their medication \u2013 even where they may have damaging side-effects and be of limited use.</p> <p>The changes are designed to help so-called \"revolving door\" patients, those stuck in a cycle where they stop taking their medication and become so unwell that they require hospital admission.</p> <p>Now where a patient refuses to take medication, they can be held and treated in hospital for 72 hours. If they still refuse, the CTO is revoked and they become a detained patient again.</p> <p>Simon Lawton-Smith, head of policy at the Mental Health Foundation, said a Department of Health-funded analysis from March last year reveals little evidence of their effectiveness. Dr Rachel Churchill and colleagues from the Institute of Psychiatry in London analysed all available research on CTOs in North America and Australasia. </p> <p>There are just 28 reports of CTO outcome studies relating to just nine primary research studies. Their conclusion was: \"There is very little evidence to suggest that CTOs are associated with any positive outcomes and there is justification for further research in this area.\"</p> <p>Lawton-Smith said there is no conclusive research to suggest that CTOs help people with mental health problems to stay well any more than good local services. </p> <p>\"It will be important to keep a very close eye on how these new powers are being used - they must not become the easy option or replace good mental health services that people want to use,\" he said.</p> <p>He said CTOs may help a small number of individuals with complex needs to stay well, rather than lose touch with services and become ill again.</p> <p>\"But taking away anyone's right to refuse treatment is questionable,\" he added. \"No one with a physical health problem is compelled to take their medication, even if not taking it might be life-threatening. </p> <p>\"Many people, including some mental health professionals, have profound concerns about compelling people to take medication that can often have very unpleasant side effects and may be of limited effectiveness.\"</p> <p>Lawton-Smith said CTOs were driven in part as a way of allying public and media concerns about the perceived danger of psychiatric patients. </p> <p>\"Sadly, the introduction of these new powers has been driven by concerns about the threat some people with mental health problems may pose to members of the public if they become unwell. However, the general risk to the public is grossly over exaggerated,\" he said.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/nov/03/mental-health-law-letter-nhs\">letter to the Guardian today</a> Professor Louis Appleby, the government's national director for mental health, and Professor Dinesh Bhugra, the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, stress that the new laws are a \"milestone\" and will ensure better care for psychiatric patients.</p> <p>The letter says: \"By continuing treatment at home following discharge patients can stay well and rebuild their lives.</p> <p>\"We are aware that some patients are worried about these changes. We can reassure them that clinicians will use their powers fairly and for the benefit of service users and their families.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday November 4 2008.

  "<p>As you probably didn't notice, parliament is scheduled to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/30/houseofcommons\">sit for a mere 128 days</a> in the coming session, well below the recent average of 155 and the 2006-07 total of 146. It may be the shortest session in a non-election year since the second world war, former Tory cabinet minister, Sir George Young, reminded Gordon Brown the other day.</p> <p>Do we care? Possibly not, but we should because the trend enhances the unaccountable power of the executive branch of government, which already has more than is good for it \u2013 or it knows what to do with.</p> <p>Defending the political class from unwarranted and often hypocritical attacks has come to be one of my missions in my dotage. </p> <p>One form of phoney accountability, much loved in old Fleet St, is attacking politicians for things they <em>didn't</em> do \u2013 getting a hand-engraved set of monogrammed aluminium plates from Oleg Deripaska in return for unspecified favours. </p> <p>Did you notice how that one melted away in the Sunday papers this weekend? These \"scandals\" usually do when the few \"facts\" known have been recycled once too often. All good, dirty fun, but destructive of public trust in politics, trust which it needs \u2013 albeit mixed with healthy scepticism \u2013 to function.</p> <p>But we all have to draw the line somewhere. I draw it at a parliament which allows the government of the day to curtail its sitting days \u2013 and thereby its ability to question and challenge ministers. </p> <p>Nowadays even the Lords sometimes sits on more days and is also more knowledgeable on some issues \u2013 as ministers who have been cross-examined in both houses will confirm. </p> <p>What prompted Young \u2013 \"the bicycling baronet\" as I dubbed him years ago \u2013 to protest was not just the announcement of plans for the new session, starting (late) on December 3 this year. The MP, one of few sacked and then brought back by Margaret Thatcher, was doubly offended when he contrasted it with what Brown said on succeeding Tony Blair.</p> <p>Do you remember that phase? He made a big reformist speech on the need to restore power to parliament and to decentralise British government. Spot on and, as he reminded George Young, he has given parliament powers to vote on war and peace, as well as one on treaties.</p> <p>At the time George Young and like-minded old hands, worried about the atrophy of parliament under Tory as well as Labour governments (Young finally made cabinet as transport secretary under John Major), were pleased because Brown had consulted the right sort of experts. He seemed committed.</p> <p>I was more sceptical because I know GB tries to do the right thing, but often finds it difficult. He is conflicted on the need to share power. At PMQs last week he told Young: \"If the House of Commons can do its business efficiently in 128 days that is the right course of action.\"</p> <p>Except, of course, it doesn't, as the refusal to let the headbangers on both sides of the abortion debate get a vote going to liberalise/restrict the 1967 Act during the recent human embryology and fertilisation bill shows.</p> <p>You could see why the whips wanted to avoid trouble: but headbangers represent headbanging voters and are entitled to a say.</p> <p>Bills in the chamber are routinely subjected to a rigorous timetable that limits debate - unthinkable a generation ago. As for the select committee system, set up by Norman St John Stevas behind Mrs T's back in 1979, it works quite well, though patchily. A committee is as strong as its chairman. </p> <p>Robin Cook, when Commons leader, wanted a beefed-up committee of selection to pick chairs and committee members, instead of the party whips. In a full debate backbenchers voted to keep the whips' chains on \u2013 for fear of even worse patronage among colleagues. A mistake, in my book.</p> <p>But Young and others, Labour as well as Tory and Lib Dem (Simon Hughes is hot on this one) are mostly concerned to revive the flagging Commons chamber. There has been no proper debate, as distinct from ministerial statements, on the war in Afghanistan, let alone Iraq, no proper debate on the economic crisis either.</p> <p>I cannot remember Gordon Brown opening a debate, as Major, Thatcher, Callaghan and their predecessors routinely did. He was as bad when he was chancellor: leaving problems to juniors to face down. When did Tony Blair last open a major Commons debate? The one I remember is the one you remember \u2013 March 2003 on the eve of the invasion of Iraq.</p> <p>As Blair admitted in his final appearance at the dispatch box, he feared the Commons - and so he should. It's scary down there on a bad day, that's what it's for. But it's good for them. Mrs T once quipped that many of her EU colleagues didn't know where their parliaments were. Cruel, but fair.</p> <p>Technology has helped kill the Commons. Televised proceedings were necessary, but they allow MPs as well as reporters and voters to watch debate from their homes and offices. That and procedural reforms \u2013 started by Major, continued by Blair-Brown \u2013 have deprived backbench rebels of real power to call ministers to order.</p> <p>They can still do so if they want. MPs control supply ie the cash flow, that was Charles I's problem in the 1630s \u2013 and it cost the fool his head. But habits atrophy fast. Most MPs nowadays, the vast majority elected since 1993, don't know what they have lost \u2013 nor what latent power they possess. Ditto political reporters.</p> <p>The democratic task force, which David Cameron asked Ken Clarke to chair to keep him out of mischief, came up with good ideas. One was to curb the number of opposition supply days \u2013 largely totemic \"whither the NHS?\" and under-reported \u2013 in return for the opposition's right to demand government statements more easily than now. </p> <p>Select committee chairmen might also be given the right to make statements on their reports and be cross-examined. There are plenty of other ideas around, not least a revived effort to wrestle the select committees from the party whips.</p> <p>When Labour whips tried to oust Don Anderson and the late Gwyneth Dunwoody, both respected and independent (especially Gwyneth) from their chairmanships, as the Tories had done to Nick Winterton at health, there was a revolt and the pair were voted back in. It did not last.</p> <p>Last summer Labour whips learned their lesson. When a new chairman of the home affairs select was needed to replace John Denham (rightly recalled to cabinet), they short-circuited procedures to install the \"reliable\" Keith Vaz as chair over the summer \u2013 rather than give the post to the deputy chairman, old but bloody-minded David Winnick.</p> <p>There's probably good bookie's odds that, one way or another, KV will turn out to be less \"reliable\" than the whips and Gordon Brown expected. Serves them right. That is a redeeming feature of it all. The best laid plans of mice and whips often go haywire. Democracy should be a messy business.</p>",
  "<p>\"Are you taking the Mickey?\" That was Timo Glock's response to the accusation that he had deliberately slowed at the end of the Brazilian grand prix's final lap to let Lewis Hamilton through into fifth place and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/nov/03/formulaone-lewishamilton\" title=\"\">world championship glory</a>. The partisan Interlagos crowd - backing local hero Felipe Massa, the only other man capable of taking the title - had booed Hamilton all weekend, and they gave Glock the same treatment after the flag had fallen.</p> <p>While the majority of fans either hailed the most thrilling grand prix finale ever, basked in Hamilton's glory or praised Massa's sportsmanlike acceptance of his fate, it wasn't long before conspiracy theorists logged on to their computers. Threads popped up along the lines of: <a href=\"http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=\" 20081102174954aacpwf7\"\" title=\"\">'Was Timo Glock ordered to slow down to allow Hamilton to win the world championship?'</a>. But, simply, there is nothing in the claim that something untoward happened.</p> <p>\"When it started to rain it was always difficult to find the right line with dry tyres,\" explained Glock. \"At the end the track was totally wet. For five laps we asked if it was better to come in, but I stayed out.\" McLaren's CEO Martin Whitmarsh, meanwhile, said the team was following Glock's position on its GPS system and was aware the Toyota was slowing and Hamilton would catch him.</p> <p>Aside from the official explanations, consider that Toyota and Glock have absolutely no allegiances towards Hamilton or McLaren and that they were trying to score as many points as they could. That given the over-aggressive penalties lobbed by the stewards at Hamilton this season, the matter would probably have been investigated if there was any semblance of truth in the allegations. True, Glock's final lap time was seriously down, but it was visibly clear he was struggling to control the car on the increasingly slippery surface.</p> <p>And even if Toyota had inexplicably decided to help Hamilton, surely they would have found a less conspicuous way of doing it? As one blogger <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/nov/02/lewishamilton-formulaone\" title=\"\">posted yesterday</a>: \"You don't rig it for the last 400 yards do you? Hollywood does, but if there's anything riding on it you just don't leave it till the 100m sprint equivalent of the last five metres.\"</p> <p>For the first time ever I heard normal individuals, not petrolheads, talking about yesterday's race as I walked down the street and stood on the train into work today. The doubting Thomases will have to try a bit harder to spoil the mood.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Spring 1998</strong></p> <p>My novel Awaydays was published on 4 March 1998. Exactly 11 years and a day later, the film of the book will have its premiere. Eleven years of scrapes and struggles and almost absurdly bad luck in trying to turn this 'cult classic' into cinema magic will come to some sort of a climax on<br>5 March 2009.</p> <p>The book is written in the voice and through the eyes of Paul Carty, a well-educated Merseyside teenager who yearns to be one of The Pack, a notorious gang of football hooligans. Carty has lost his mother a year previously and retreated into isolation. He's into Joy Division and Lou Reed, but his nihilistic search for thrills disguises a greater quest for identity and meaning in his young life. He meets a volatile, troubled soul called Mark Always \u2013 Elvis \u2013 and from that point something has to break.</p> <p>After interest from Little, Brown, 4th Estate and Simon &amp; Schuster, Jonathan Cape bought Awaydays on 2 May 1997. The following day, Tony Blair was confirmed as Prime Minister. It was a success from the off. Cape had to reprint before publication day due to an unexpectedly high take-up. Reviewers from the Guardian to the Independent to the Telegraph heaped praise on the book and it seemed not impossible that, in the wake of Trainspotting making its mark in cinema, Awaydays, too, might translate to screen.</p> <p><strong>Summer 1998</strong></p> <p>A phone call from my friend Pete Naylor. He and Carl Hunter run a film production company called Domestic Films, which has just made Unlovable, a short film about a Morrissey acolyte. Their executive producer is a young Scot called Angus Lamont, and he's setting up a slate of films with Muriel Grey's Glasgow-based indie, Ideal World. Pete wants to know if the rights to Awaydays are available and, if so, can he bung Angus a copy ? Of course he can.</p> <p>My agent, Norman North, calls a few days later. Gus \u2013 as he shall henceforth be known \u2013 likes the book. He's keen to meet. We have a drink at Ma Egerton's near Liverpool's Lime Street station, and I like him. He's realistic about our chances (slim to zero) but confident he can give Awaydays a good run for his money. Crucially, he wants me to write the script. I offer little resistance. </p> <p>Norman negotiates a fee of \u00a34,000 for the underlying rights in the book, and \u00a310,000 for me to write the script. I'll get \u00a35,000 for the first draft, \u00a32,500 for a set of revisions and a further \u00a32,500 on delivery. Furthermore, should the film be made, I will receive a staggering sum amounting to 2.5 per cent of the film's budget, with a minimum (or 'floor' as it says in the contract) of \u00a340,000, going up to a 'ceiling' of \u00a375,000. I celebrate with my friend Charlie Galloway , the music supervisor behind a lot of great film soundtracks.</p> <p>I tell Charlie I don't care about the money, I just want the film to get made now. Fingers crossed, I pray for a \u00a33m budget.</p> <p>A few weeks later I get a call from Dave Hughes. Yoz is a mate from the Liverpool post-punk scene. He's just finished working on the soundtrack to a film from the up-and-coming producer-director team of Matthew Vaughn and Guy Ritchie. It's called Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. 'Stupid fucking name for a gangster film, that,' I say. 'Is Norman Wisdom in it?' But Yoz reckons it is destined for big things.</p> <p>He's given Matthew Vaughn Awaydays to read and he's keen to discuss a deal. There's a strange gnawing in my guts as I tell Dave the rights have gone. Instinctively I'm relieved that Awaydays won't be at the mercy of a Southern sensibility. But Yoz's aubade has a haunting timbre: 'Pity, that, mate. They're going to be players, these two. They can make pretty well whatever they want\u2026'</p> <p><strong>Spring 1999</strong></p> <p>Uh-oh. Gus has registered for the Robert McKee lecture. McKee is the L Ron Hubbard of screenwriting theory, and those exposed to his teachings emerge beatific converts, unable henceforth to embrace work that fails to conform to McKee's principles-of-story structure. In a previous life I worked for Steve Garrett at Channel 4 (today, Steve's Kudos company makes such high-concept television drama as Life on Mars, SpooksHustle and Echo Beach/Moving Wallpaper).</p> <p>Steve attended the McKee lecture in 1988 and returned, evangelical, handing out precis of the notes he'd taken. I well remember one of the first principles, concerning your film's hero. 'What does your hero want? Why can't he get it?'</p> <p>In our first script meeting after the McKee experience, Gus fixes me with his producer's look and says: 'Carty. What does he really want? And why can't he get it?'</p> <p><strong>Summer 1999</strong></p> <p>I've written a first draft, a second draft and revised versions of both \u2013 all quickly rejected by potential film financiers. The problem is that there are very few serious film funders in the UK. Essentially it's Film 4 (the movie business arm of C4), the BBC and, soon, Blair's new baby, the UK Film Council. Gus just wants to get us into the system and reckons the best way is to apply for script development funding. I sit with Gus through three meetings with script development executives and watch their eyes glaze . One woman says: 'I fail to comprehend why I should care even a jot for these frankly unpleasant creatures.'</p> <p>But Gus doesn't give up on me. He gives me three things. A further \u00a32,500 for a new draft. A piece of software called Final Draft that will format my dense script works into something resembling a screenplay. And he gives me a script editor. Chris Penfold is a revelation . We spend three or four sessions on an old sloop moored at Liverpool Marina giving the script an intensive workout. He just sits , hour after hour, asking me questions: 'And who does Carty relate to more? His mother or his father?' It works. I head into the new draft with a spring in my step and a clear idea of what's needed to make this great rites-of-passage story into equally great cinema.</p> <p><strong>Winter 1999</strong></p> <p>All change at Film 4. Under the tutelage of Paul Webster , they're looking to make bigger-budget films \u2013 but insist there will always be a place for distinctive British projects. Gus sends them the latest draft of our distinctive British project. It's December. Webster's deputy at Film 4, Elinor Day, is keen to discuss the script, before the Christmas break if possible. Gus has already booked a snow boarding holiday and can't make it, but thinks I should still go, solo. </p> <p>Film 4's offices are a minimalist glass-and-steel affair in Charlotte Street. I'm insecure in meetings like this, in places like this. I'm 38, my hair is going white and I know C4 prizes youth above everything. They want mussed-up hair and chunky red spectacles, not my lived-in face and fl at vowels.</p> <p>I'm in such a funk of angry, regionalist resentment that I almost don't care when the receptionist tells me Elinor is on her way down to collect me. I'm a bit disarmed by this. Big cheeses in the film world don't come down to collect their guests. But my terror-fuelled prejudices come coursing back as the lift disgorges a bespectacled, funky-looking student speaking excitedly to a very tall lady. In French. She kisses him on both cheeks, tells him it's been fantastic meeting him and sends him on his way with a Joyeux No\u00ebl. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm thinking \u2013 just piss off back to Paris, you spiky-haired divvy\u2026 Elinor turns to me, and her face lights up. 'My God, Kevin, I'm so sorry! I really couldn't avoid that. Thanks so much for coming in. I just love Awaydays\u2026'</p> <p>She means it . She reckons the script needs a tweak, nothing too drastic. But she's already sent it on to Paul Webster with a rave review. Maybe Awaydays will be the Quadrophenia of the new millennium.</p> <p><strong>2000</strong></p> <p>The joy is short-lived. Not that anything fatal happens, but Film 4 give Gus the go-ahead for another of his films, Late Night Shopping , and that's him out of action for most of the year. I can't shake the feeling that this is going to hurt Awaydays. Not long after the book was published, Mike Hodges sent me a postcard saying how much he'd loved it. I was overjoyed \u2013 maybe, just maybe, the director of Get Carter would want to get involved?</p> <p>Somehow, it never happened. Hodges was going through a terrible time with Film 4 over his new film Croupier and I suspect that Gus was, justifiably, unwilling to jeopardise his hard-won relationship with the UK's only real superpower in the film world. Elinor Day, too, is preoccupied with a major budget adaptation of Sebastian Faulks's novel Charlotte Gray. It feels like Awaydays has gone flat.</p> <p>Gus dispatches me to see Chris Auty at The Film Consortium , which has tons of cash, and Chris is 'a fan of the book'. I'm becoming a little cynical at all these 'fans of the book' . If everyone loves it so much, why is it proving so hard to make? The meeting is a much-needed shot in the arm, though. Chris genuinely does 'get' Awaydays. He's a Northerner, a very amusing raconteur and reckons Awaydays is the first novel ever to mention Joy Division. And just as I'm allowing myself to get excited, he follows up with the hammer blow: 'I'm fascinated by Factory Records. Aren't you? I'd love to do omething about Factory. Don't you think that'd be great? If I don't do your film I'll definitely do Factory.' It was to be our first and last meeting. A couple of years on, 24 Hour Party People comes out. It remains one of my favourite films, ever.</p> <p><strong>2001</strong></p> <p>Late Night Shopping wins a prize at the Berlin Film Festival. Gus is cock-a-hoop. With Film 4 and others now clamouring for his next projects, he sets us up with Pat Harkins , a young Scottish director who has just completed his first movie, The Final Curtain. Hallelujah! We have a director attached. Alan Yentob calls Gus. Yentob is a legendary arts producer and programmer at the BBC with a seemingly free remit . He spends his life being courted by aspiring programme-makers and very rarely feels the urge or the need to call people. But Gus is going to Yentob's house for dinner. We agree that this can only mean one thing. He wants Awaydays. Gus recounts the evening with typical bleak humour. He and Yentob discussed everything from lottery funding to the spiralling budget for the new Opera House. They drank several bottles of exceptionally good wine. After three hours and four or five bottles, Gus found himself saying: 'So\u2026Awaydays?' Yentob had never heard of it. Bemused, Gus gently inquired as to the purpose of the evening.</p> <p>'I have you on my radar,' said Yentob. </p> <p>Late Night Shopping bombs in the UK. The clamour for Gus's next winner recedes. But it's not all bad. Film 4 have unveiled The Lab, a hothouse for low-budget, experimental and regional film. It will be headed by Robin Gutch. Robin is a fan of the book. I get to work on a new draft of the script.</p> <p>Gus reckons this new draft is very nearly there but wants my blessing to bring in a new writer. It takes half a minute or so for me to process what<br>he's saying here. I think I'm being sacked. Gus is quick to reassure me. It's not going to be a rewrite. More of a trim from a 'safe pair of hands' who can take a dispassionate look and help carve out the film we all know this can be. </p> <p>The writer's name is Rob Fraser , an experienced TV writer. After all the support I've had from Gus and Glasgow production company Ideal World, I owe them a bit of grace. I summon up every last spark of wit and good humour I can dredge from my soul, and try to squeeze some enthusiasm into my voice. In December, Rob's script comes through. It's a complete rewrite.</p> <p><strong>2002</strong></p> <p>In what will be Gus's last throw of the dice, he commissions the Manchester-based casting agent Michael Jackson to workshop Rob 's version of the script. Until now I have been almost saintly in my praise for Rob's redraft. I badly want to help Gus get Awaydays made. But seeing it play out now in front of my very eyes is more than I can bear. It's like sitting there, a set smile on your face as you thumbs-up the man ravishing your wife. These characters are not my Pack. Carty is not Carty. I stumble out, and don't come back.</p> <p><strong>2003</strong></p> <p>'The film should be 77 minutes long. We'll just go punk on it. Do everything ourselves\u2026 it'll be brilliant!' The rights in Awaydays have reverted back to me. Ideal World have given the film a brave go, but they're cutting back. They won't be renewing their option. Gus is executive producer of a new<br>Robbie Coltrane drama on ITV, The Plan man. I think we parted on good terms, but I'm relieved that the last version of Awaydays didn't see the<br>light of day. </p> <p>I've come to realise that I'm emotionally attached to Awaydays in a way that is almost unhealthy. I will never hand over control again. 'We should do it like Zoo Records, or Factory. Take control of all the creative decisions, everything\u2026' I'm in The Ship &amp; Mitre in Liverpool's Dale Street , talking to Dave Hughes. I've just hosted a war council for anyone and everyone who has ever shown an interest in Awaydays, telling them the film is getting made, come what may. Present are Ian Lysaght and Dave Cotterill, who will go on to make excellent films of their own. Alex Cox pops in and offers encouragement, too. Alex is a fan of the book.</p> <p>But once the party breaks up, Yoz tells me that if I can rewrite the script with a minimal cast and an eye on a micro-budget of around \u00a3300,000 (\u00a33m is considered 'low-budget' in the UK), he's confident he can do something . He's formed a company with an experienced producer called Peter La Terriere. Their plan is to take advantage of revolutions in digital (ie cheap) movie-making, along with tax incentives for investors in film.</p> <p>I am now consumed by the idea of seeing Awaydays on the silver screen. I've long since realised there'll be no big payday, no \u00a375,000 ceilings. But fuck that, I'm convinced that audiences will love this film and here's one last chance to prove it. I start from scratch. New era, brand new script. I take a deep, deep breath and ask myself: 'What does Carty really want? Why can't he have it?' </p> <p>The resulting screenplay is a lean, mean 78 pages. It's the best version yet \u2013 taut and punchy, but poetic too, I think. It's beautiful. Yoz and Peter L a Terriere agree. Just a case of finding the money then.</p> <p><strong>2004</strong></p> <p>Peter receives an offer he'd be mad to refuse (the UK producer's role on the long-awaited Terence Malick picture The New World ). Yoz receives notice that Parr Street Studios , where he's based, is to be sold to property developers. In the wake of Liverpool being announced as European Capital of Culture 2008, the city centre has been invaded by cranes and scaffolding. </p> <p>Our little cultural enterprise will have to find a new home. Chris Moll joins North West Vision, the local outpost of the UK Film Council, charged with<br>identifying, supporting and providing business structure for the North West's talent. I've applied to them a few times for script development support on Awaydays but invariably been dejected by the response.</p> <p>I warn Dave that the moment NWV know it's Awaydays the curtains will come down. But Moll arrives with a good reputation and Yoz has a cunning plan. His strategy is to apply for business and infrastructure funding. He has a long-standing partnership with a Liverpool-supporting, chain-smoking, serial-swearing techno-boffin whizzkid called Dave Harry. Where computers and cameras and technology are concerned, Dave can build or fix anything. </p> <p>Yoz wants to build a micro-studio from scratch. More than half a film's budget is spent on post-production costs, but if we own that equipment\u2026 </p> <p>The decision will rest on the viability of Yoz's business plan. Editorial concerns will not come into it. </p> <p><strong>2005</strong></p> <p>I'm barefoot on what passes for a lawn in our postage-stamp garden, sipping tea. I'm supposed to be trimming the overgrown borders with an electric hedge trimmer. I took my training shoes off to go indoors and make myself a cuppa, and was too lazy to put the mug down and put my shoes back on. A moment ago, I skinned the plastic coating on the trimmer's long orange lead, and the stupid thing is, I know I've exposed live wires. I got a tiny little shock just before, and I've just seen a wasp explode. But I'm daydreaming as I take up a load of slack so that I can move on and tackle a new patch. </p> <p>I grasp the live wire in my hand. The flesh of my palm starts to smoulder immediately. The current jolts through me and I become a part of the electric circuit. I can't drop the trimmer \u2013 I'm magnetically welded to it. I can't control it either. I try to keep my head out of its way as it lurches up and down, steel teeth churning. I scream and scream but know no one can hear me. It occurs to me that I am going to die. With no shoes to earth the current, I'm going to frazzle to death. I start to accept it, and begin to wonder what, technically, will cause my death. Heart attack? Burns? I can<br>smell my flesh melting, and I'm going weak and can't even hold the trimmer off. </p> <p>It's chopping at me and all I can do is keep my head craned out of its way. It chops at my shoulder, chops at my collar bone, chops and chops and I pass out. I'm unsure, still, how I survived the accident. I came to, vomiting, on the grass. There was a man standing over me, but I could never describe him. <br>He must have called an ambulance. The paramedics said it was a miracle I was alive.</p> <p>Reconstructive surgery, rehabilitation, physiotherapy and very, very strong painkillers mean I cannot work for the remainder of the year. I've paid my taxes and NIC for ever, but find I'm ineligible for any kind of unemployment or incapacity benefits. Debt closes in on me. But I realise that I can't face death again without getting this one thing out of the way. I have to see Awaydays made.<br><strong><br>2006</strong></p> <p>Having transmitted this vision to Yoz as my New Year's resolution, he and I set about formalising the company. We're both in tune as to the guiding principles of this bold new entity. Its model will be the great independent record companies of the Seventies \u2013 Zoo, Fast Product , Factory. Our driving force is that we shall not be at the mercy of the institutional development process that, we believe, is suffocating the talent flow in British film. We bandy names about and, in a bolshie mindset, decide on Red Union.</p> <p>Shooting commences on Control. In my current state of mind, now so far adrift financially that I've taken debt counselling , it's hard not to feel a pang of hurt. T he world had forgotten about Joy Division until Awaydays was published. I was on to this stuff way before all these London media ponces.</p> <p>But that's how martyrs think \u2013 and I'm not ready to fall on my sword. Yoz has found a haunted, disused pub overlooking the Mersey that fits his needs. He and Dave Harry can move into the upper floor immediately, then kit out the lower floors with editing and duplicating gear as and when funding arrives. After months of filling in forms , we have made it to the panel stage of North West Vision's funding process. </p> <p>The received wisdom is that if they call you in, you'll get something. Dave, Dave and I arrive at their loft-style offices in the former Mantuna Tea Factory. We're relaxed \u2013 until we're taken through to the panel. There are 12 people round the table. Some never speak and it's all over before it's even begun. They tell us that (a) they really like us, (b) they really, really want to support Red Union but (c) they don't like Awaydays. Sorry. Editorial concerns have, after all, come into it. A detailed script report will follow in the post. It does. It's insulting in its generality and subjectivity. But rejection is perhaps the most powerful creative motor known to man.</p> <p>What started as a vague desire to make a good film out of a good book has become a mission to prove The Industry wrong. It's become a class war.</p> <p><strong>January 2007</strong> </p> <p>Yoz has been analysing the latest version of the government's enterprise investment scheme. An EIS encourages persons of high net worth to invest in small business enterprises. If the business qualifies , there's a tax incentive for the investor that makes their gamble pretty attractive. Red Union qualifies. It's going to be another slog, with most of the onus on Dave as the producer. But he engages the services of Malthouse , a much respected firm of chartered accountants, to set up the fund.<br><strong><br>July 2007</strong></p> <p>We have \u00a3400,000 in the EIS fund. Terrifyingly, we can press the magic button marked ' green light'. Soberingly, we have neither a cast nor a director.</p> <p>Since composing the soundtrack for The Long Weekend, Yoz has had his eye on Pat Holden , the director. We meet him in the garden of our local coffee shop and spend the afternoon giggling over near-misses and catastrophes in the film business. He seems to have an intuitive feel for the heartbeat of Awaydays \u2013 Carty and Elvis's search for meaning in their young lives. We've found our director. </p> <p>These are halcyon days. We don't fully realise it , but Yoz and I are film producers. We're doing the things and making the decisions producers do. And our biggest decision is whether to go hell for leather and make this film before the year is out or wait until spring and do things properly. No contest, then. Having waited 10 years , it's going to take a powerful argument to hold us back.</p> <p>But we agree to let fate decide. We call revered casting director Michelle Smith . Michelle has just cast This is England and clearly has a knack for unearthing young, untried acting talent. If she can find us a Carty and an Elvis, we make the film. If the search has to go on indefinitely, that's fine<br>too. But there has to be alchemy between Carty and Elvis. There has to be magic. The moment Nicky Bell walks into the casting suite we're hypnotised . He's a cocky little rascal, but vulnerable, too. He's Carty. It's now a case of<br>finding the perfect foil . Elvis has to be sexy, arrogant, romantic, poetic, violent\u2026 not much to ask for in a young, untried actor. Part of the Red Union<br>philosophy is that we're keen to foster unknown talent. Just as Quadrophenia launched a dozenyoung actors, we want Awaydays to showcase a brand new Rat Pack \u2013 the Pack Pack. </p> <p>We're smitten by the performances of Alfie Allen, Oliver Lee, Christian Cook \u2013 but Liam Boyle makes Elvis all his own. He's one of these kids that the camera just laps up and the chemistry between him and Nicky is enchanted. It's an indescribably emotional moment, coming out of the final casting into an electric storm that tears the sky into strips, knowing that this is it. No turning back now.</p> <p>Awaydays will be released on 5 March 2009</p> <h2>Musical Youth - British Teenage Tribes on the Big Screen</h2> <p><strong>Teddy Boys 1950s</strong></p> <p>Credited for bringing fashion to the postwar male consciousness, teddy boys sported clothes infl uenced by both Edwardian England and contemporary America \u2013 loose-collared white shirts with skinny ties and a brocade waistcoat, high-waisted trousers in a drainpipe cut and suede 'brothel creeper' shoes. Musically, meanwhile, they listened to early rock'n'roll by acts such as Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis. As seen in: The Damned (Joseph Losey, 1963) <br><strong><br>Rockers, 1950s/1960s</strong>.</p> <p>As the teddy boy subculture faded, it split into two distinct factions that formed their own subcultures: mods and rockers. Also known as greasers, rockers were infl uenced by American film and music and were synonymous with motorbikes. Their style was practical as much as it was fashionable \u2013 leather motorcycle jackets, aviator sunglasses, Levi's jeans and slicked-back hair \u2013 while Chuck Berry, Eddie Cochran and Bo Diddley soundtracked their lives. As seen in The Wild One (Laslo Benedek, 1953)</p> <p><strong>Mods, 1960s</strong></p> <p>Mods were also a rejection of mainstream British pop culture. Stemming from the material wealth of postwar working-class Britain, mods were characterised by Vespa scooters, expensive, tailored suits, button-pin badges and the Union Jack and RAF roundel symbol. Keen to be on the cutting edge, they listened to whatever was new, from African-American soul music to Jamaican ska, and frequented London's all-night nightclubs the Scene, the Flamingo and the Marquee. As seen in Quadrophenia (Franc Roddam, 1979)<br><strong><br>Skinheads, 1970s</strong></p> <p>The harder mods soon merged into the early skinheads, at first a nonpolitical subculture that mixed with Jamaican rudeboys and danced at West Indian clubs. Later, skinheads became increasingly associated with racism and extreme right-wing politics. Eventually skins swapped ska for oi!, a thuggish strain of punk, although their main interest was football, to which they wore Ben Sherman shirts, braces and heavy workboots. As seen in This is England (Shane Meadows, 2006)</p> <p><strong>Casuals, 1980s</strong><br>Heavily influenced by the skinhead subculture before them and the late-Seventies mod revival, casuals were noted for their participation in football hooliganism and fondness for designer clothing. The expensive<br>labels helped them escape the attention of the police and infiltrate the pubs of rival football teams on match days. Their musical tastes were eclectic, but<br>casuals are associated with acid house, techno and the Madchester and Britpop movements. As seen in The Business (Nick Love, 2005)</p>",

Black used to play guitar with, and write most of the songs for, indie band the Servant (not to be confused with Luke Haines of the Auteurs' first band, the Servants), whose music featured in trailers for the film Sin City and who released an album in 2006 called How to Destroy a Relationship. We could have saved him the time and told him ourselves. Black's distinctive vocals were also used on records by an Italian outfit called Planet Funk and have been likened to those of \"a young Liam Gallagher if he'd been raised by Quentin Crisp\", which surely means he's got a voice like a camp football thug. He doesn't, but we sort of know what they were driving at: he sounds simultaneously sensitive yet strident, lispy and surly. <br> The schizoid-impulse thing is proving to be his calling card: Black cites his two influences on his MySpace as Jay-Z and Sigur Ros, and although we know he's being artful, his cover version of Notorious BIG's HPNTZ, released earlier this year as a limited-edition seven-inch single, was a piece of chillaxed rapmospherica that managed to be both soothing and sinister. A one-time Zane Lowe Hottest Track In the World, it featured Black's yearning vocals over a mash-up of Rihanna's Umbrella beat and some sweeping strings from John Carpenter's film Starman and sounded a bit like The Verve's Bittersweet Symphony being tickled in a back alley by Mike Skinner. No wonder it \"blew up\" \"big style\" on the \"blogosphere\" and made Perez Hilton behave like Paris Hilton. </p> <p>His forthcoming debut single proper, Yours, is a Prince-ly slice of future-funk with a staccato beat, minimalist bassline and swirly electro FX as well as an independence-declaring lyric (\"Don't want to be yours no more\") that makes it a sort of I Will Survive for Hoxton trendy-boys. It's accompanied by a gaudily playful video, apparently made for \"zero pence\" and directed by hip Parisians Chic Et Ertistic, while Black was on holiday in Lombok, Bali, Hong Kong and Paris. If this is what he can do while he's on holiday, god knows what he can do when he's at work. <br> <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"He's going to be a massive star in 2009.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> Yes, he's going to be a gigantic, luminous ball of plasma next year. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Light up the night sky. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Affect the Hadron Collider. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Yours is released by A&amp;M on December 1, with the debut album to follow in early 2009.<br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Tom Vek, Calvin Harris, Jamie T, Jamie Lidell. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/danblacksound\">www.myspace.com/danblacksound</a> </p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Deadfisch.</p>",
  "<h2>Last minute dash</h2> <p>The final, nerve-jangling weekend of the election campaign offered several unpleasant moments for Barack Obama and his supporters, above all the revelation that his Kenyan paternal aunt, Zeituni Onyango, was living in Boston in contravention of a deportation order. (Immigration is an issue that could theoretically draw votes away from Obama, though John McCain is far from a hardline anti-immigration voter's dream candidate.) </p> <p>Then there was the ad, paid for by Pennsylvania Republicans, that broke McCain's promise not to make an issue of Obama's pastor, Jeremiah Wright, who was shown thundering \"God damn America!\" There were robocalls quoting Hillary Clinton calling Obama inexperienced, and also a tape of a newspaper interview which, Republicans argued, showed Obama was willing to bankrupt the US coal industry.</p> <p>But none of it seemed to stick. There was a little time remaining, of course, for these last Republican attacks to weigh against Obama. But by the end of the weekend there was no sign that they had done. The RealClearPolitics average put him on 50% to John McCain's 43% - a lead that, if replicated in tomorrow's election, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/03/barack-obama-us-elections-polls\">would produce a landslide victory</a>, Suzanne Goldenberg and Ewen Macaskill write in the Guardian today.</p> <p>Both candidates hared across the country, Obama stressing the importance of actually voting and McCain claiming that he could sense that \"the momentum is there\" for him to win. \"What we are in for is a slam-bang finish,\" predicted McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, while McCain's former rival, Fred Thompson, told NBC: \"John's a closer. He always has been. He often is given up for dead - literally and politically. People have been wrong about him before.\" But as Obama appeared alongside Bruce Springsteen in Cleveland last night, permitting himself some optimistic words before a crowd of 80,000, the momentum seemed to be heading in one direction only.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>In last-minute campaigning overdrive, McCain visits Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Mexico and Nevada today, finishing with an event in Arizona. Obama is in Florida and North Carolina, and concludes his campaign with a rally in Manassas, Virginia. Both candidates will be interviewed during the halftime break on Monday Night Football. And thus the campaign draws to a close.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Obama ended the weekend with commanding leads in national polls: 52%-43% in Gallup's likely voter tracking poll, 51%-46% for Rasmussen's and 54%-43% in ABC News's - as good as his best performance to date in that poll. A CNN poll has Obama 53% to McCain's 46%, a USA Today survey (also done by Gallup) puts the candidates at 53%-42%. The scale of the challenge for McCain, in a nutshell: by the Washington Post' reckoning, he'd have to win all the states that are solidly Republican, all the states that are leaning Republican, all the states that are a toss-up - and still find an additional 23 electoral college votes in order to win. Mason-Dixon polls over the weekend put Obama well ahead in Colorado, Virginia, Nevada and North Carolina, and with a narrow lead in Florida, with McCain two points ahead in Ohio and Missouri. And the final poll from the Pew Research Centre doesn't just put Obama in the lead: it goes so far as to predict that he will actually win by six points, 52% to 46%.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/03/george-bush-legacy-dubya\">Simon Schama: Nowhere man: a farewell to Dubya</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/03/us-election-republicans-democrats-tomasky\">Michael Tomasky: Liberal paranoiacs, breathe easy</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/03/us-elections-international-opinion\">The world holds its breath as America decides</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/nov/03/uselections-2008-american-muslims\">Road trip, one day to go: America's outcast Muslims</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/audio/2008/nov/03/us-president-election-last-day-campaign\">Audio: Suzanne Goldenberg on the closing stages of the campaign</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/world/video/2008/nov/03/uselections20081\">Video: Gary Younge visits his mother-in-law</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2203420/\">Slate: An Obama loss would be a disaster</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/03/opinion/03krugman.html?ref=opinion\">Paul Krugman, New York Times: Defeat will leave a Republican rump</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1108/15194.html\">Politico: Superstition and strategy in Obamaland</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/02/AR2008110201737.html?hpid=topnews\">Washington Post: Ohio, the state both candidates covet</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alec-baldwin/voting-for-truth_b_140304.html&quot;\">Huffington Post: Voting for truth</a></p> <h2>Quotes of the weekend</h2> <p>\"You start thinking maybe we might be able to win an election on November 4\": Barack Obama, appearing alongside Bruce Springsteen at a Cleveland rally that drew an estimated 80,000 people, many of whom were reportedly in tears</p> <p>\"I don't know about you, but I want my country back, I want my dream back, I want my America back\": The Boss speaks</p> <p>\"Yesterday, Dick Cheney came out of his undisclosed location.

  "<p><strong>By Robert Andrews</strong></p> <p>A typically speculative Sunday newspaper story, this time <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/nov/02/independent-mail-media-newspaper-buyout\">from <strong>The Observer</strong></a>, reckons <strong>Daily Mail</strong> (LSE: DMGT) owner DMGT is considering buying out-of-favour <strong>The Independent</strong> from <strong>Gavin O'Reilly</strong>'s Independent News &amp; Media (INM). That claim is put forward by \"industry sources\", despite DMGT execs themselves being confirmed \"wary\" - still, what's a contradiction between friends?

  "<p>There is growing concern about the denial of press freedom in Sri Lanka.

  "<p>For the past year the public in Pakistan has been incensed by <a href=\"http://www.thenews.com.pk/top_story_detail.asp?Id=17964\">daily power cuts</a>. The past month saw unprecedented black-outs of 12 hours. Then, like a back-hand in the dark, business owners and working class alike have been slapped with a bill charging them three times the usual monthly charge for electricity. The <a href=\"http://www.thenews.com.pk/print1.asp?id=142255\">official explanation</a> for the price hike is that energy supply companies have began charging higher tariffs earlier than planned. Lahore Electric Supply Company officials anonymously told a reporter from Urdu daily paper Jang that they were given revenue targets to reach. </p> <p>\"If this is the cost, then I don't want any\" has been the general sentiments of those protesting across the country, setting fire to tyres and bills alike. But are the flaming tyres enough to up the heat on Pakistan's half-baked government, who for once will have to come up with a working solution for all four provinces. Statements from the people already demonstrate a great deal of mistrust.</p> <p>\"If a collections officer comes here, this area's men will not have to raise a finger, we'll tie them up and twist their necks\", one woman told me at a protest made up of one side-street's female residents. One elderly resident died of a heart attack upon receiving the bill. His neighborhood, Rasul Park Colony, held a procession and a protest in his honor.</p> <p>Demonstrations against over-billing occurred in both the major as well as median sized cities like Sargodha, Faislabad, Chakwal, and Nankana. Offices of Lahore Electric Supply Company have been assaulted by mobs, and an <a href=\"http://www.thenews.com.pk/updates.asp?id=58329\">engineer was attacked in Sheikhapura</a>. And there are likely to be more violent protests: to cope with escalating costs some industries have closed factories, with textiles losing over 100,000 jobs.</p> <p>So as discontent increases, a discouraging trend occurs with how the public justifies mob violence. The first protest of this sort happened last week, when a Lahore Electric Supply Company office was torched by a mob in Gujurpura, Lahore. The following day demonstrators told me they would not be afraid to attack more offices if the billing continued. They placed the onus of the blame on President Zardari.</p> <p>The official response from the ruling party was defensive, encouraging the public \"to have faith in the government they helped form\". Now that the government has pushed to reduce a proposed tariff hike of 60%, a reduction some credit the violence as being instrumental in achieving.</p> <p>One reason for this rise in Pakistani protesting culture is the involvement of opposition parties in patronising civil unrest. Under Musharraf, protests by Sindhis against the construction of the <a href=\"http://www.unescap.org/drpad/vc/conference/ex_pk_57_kdp.htm\">Kalabagh Dam</a> were sponsored by the People's Party. The lawyers' movement has by and large been sponsored by money and statements by Nawaz Sharif's Muslim League. Danish Cartoon and Salman Rushdie protests are held by scattered religious parties.</p> <p>This intersection of political campaign and patronising protest has led to an easily agitated, violent public. When the mob burned down the LESCO office, they destroyed the records required to prove their case of over-billing. Wrecked government property is replaced with tax money. In this recent development, the Pakistani government has proven to be ineffective in educating the public to push petitions through consumer and standard courts. </p> <p>Other facilities, such as the Monopoly Control Authority, have been contacted in the past to resolve cement and sugar cartels. There are other avenues as well, to which the people could have appealed instead of rioting. As more jobs get cut, which is inevitable in this crisis, an effective outreach to the isolated labour class will also be necessary to curb violence. While there is a set minimum wage, the secretary of labour in Lahore claims the number of labourers registered with them is neglible. </p> <p>Now, time is of the essence to breath life into these projects. As it stands, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority has stated it opposes relief in the form of lower tarrifs on electricity. Since the attacks on their assets, no officials in either NEPRA or the electric supply companies will allow themselves to appear to be giving concessions to rioters.</p> <p>Foreign involvement in Pakistan's development has changed as well, recent American rhetoric on Pakistan is to \"take money off the table\". Old time partner, China has made plans for nuclear power projects to be built in the country over the next 10 years. But those are some time away.</p> <p>Besides cleaner hydro and wind energy generation, one priority project for Pakistan could be to take advantage of its coal deposits, which are the fifth biggest in the world. There have been plans for coal factories in the past, most famously one by Hong Kong tycoon <a href=\"http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/SAserials/Dawn/1995/13Ap95.html#wuto\">Gordon Wu</a>. Wu's plans for a coal power plant in Tharparkar, Sindh raised $1.8bn in foreign investment. The plans were realised after the project was cleared by a joint chiefs of staff committee in 1997. </p> <p>The plan was <a href=\"http://www.dawn.com/2008/05/17/letted.htm\">canned inexplicably</a> three months into Sharif's second term. One popular explanation for the canning has been what many call the singular development of the Punjab province, at the expense of Sindh, Balochistan, and the North West Frontier Province. Ironically, there have been demonstrations against government energy projects with the same reasoning as well. Many saw the construction of the Kalabagh Dam as a measure by the Punjab government to assert its hegemony in Sindh.</p> <p>The government can't afford to lose out on such projects, and at the same time can't afford to dole out the same top-down relief in the form of tariff cuts anymore. But when described as having \"No money, no energy, no government\", it's hard to think of what the government can afford to do at all. Pakistan will have to clear up the mistrust that divides it along its provinces, and the government must rethink its current rapport with the public to deal with the countrywide crises to come.</p>",

What they would see instead is one nation under secularism \u2013 or at best one nation under a very secularised modern understanding of God.</p> <p>The truth is that almost everything in America has been secularised, including <a href=\"http://saddleback.com/flash/index.html\">religion itself</a>. This explains America's culture of religiosity without religion: \"God\" talk persists but it means less and less, as Americans try and shoehorn secularist morality and philosophy into fast-eroding religious concepts.</p> <p>What exactly do references to \"God\" mean in a culture where the lifestyles of the \"religious\" and the non-religious are almost indistinguishable \u2013 in a culture where politicians punctuate every speech with \"God Bless America\" before trotting off to vote for partial-birth abortion and gay civil unions? </p> <p>God-talk in such a culture becomes nothing more than a projection of modern fads, currents and desires \u2013 an appropriation of religion for essentially secularist purposes. Hence liberal arguments, whether it is for abortion or gay marriage, are usually shrouded in religious garb.</p> <p>But the reality is that theism, properly understood and forthrightly stated, holds little sway over the ordering of American society. It has been dislodged, whether politicians admit it or not, by de facto agnosticism. Man, not God, is the measure of all things.</p> <p>Just look at the the assumptions underlying political discussions in America: secularism is assumed to be identical with \"reason\" while theism represents \"mere opinion\". Thus any politician who argues against legislation on the grounds that it violates a God-given moral law is dismissed out of hand.</p> <p>America's founding fathers would enjoy little standing in today's debates. They did not consider the existence of God a mere opinion or guess but a truth accessible to reason \u2013 a truth upon which they based the Declaration of Independence and Bill of Rights. Were a politician to write such documents today, he would be rebuked for \"imposing religion\" on his fellow Americans.</p> <p>Democratic party presidential nominee Barack Obama, who combines the rhetoric of religion with the philosophy of secularism, once lectured theists: </p> <blockquote> <p>Democracy demands that the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal, rather than religion-specific, values. It requires that their proposals be subject to argument, and amenable to reason.</p> </blockquote> <p>Leave theism behind, in other words. America's founding fathers would find Obama's formulation odd: for them, values are \"universal\" precisely because they derive from God, whereas lowest-common-denominator secularism yields no universal values, just relativistic fragmentation.</p> <p>Secularism is a very thin reed on which to hang a political society. But that's the new democratic experiment underway in America.</p> <p><em>If you would like to comment on this week's question, please go <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/03/usa-question-under-god\">here</a></em></p>",
  "<p>The crackdown on freedom of speech is mounting in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt\">Egypt</a> as the failed social and economic policies of the regime cause the state security apparatus to gain more power. A few days ago I sent out an email to my distribution list, with a link to a piece I've written for <a href=\"http://www.ikhwanonline.com/\">Ikhwanonline.net</a>, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Muslim_Brotherhood_in_Egypt\">Muslim Brotherhood</a>'s official Arabic website. A few minutes later, a friend of mine who works for <a href=\"http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/index.htm\">Al-Ahram</a>, Egypt's largest public-owned newspaper, responded by email telling me she could not read the article as the access to the website is restricted. </p> <p>According to the newspaper's policy, accessing the website is a \"violation of your internet usage policy\", and the Muslim Brotherhood \u2014 which has 88 parliamentarians comprising 20% of the Egyptian parliament's seats \u2014 belongs to the \"extremist groups\" category.</p> <p>This should not be acceptable in a website, where journalists are supposed to access all different sources of information, and connect with people across the political spectrum. It is definitely unacceptable from a public-owned newspaper, which should maintain neutrality and political autonomy. Certainly, labelling the Brotherhood as an extremist group is unacceptable. Even President Mubarak declared in a statement to the very same newspaper, Al-Ahram, in 1993, that there are two trends of Islamic movements in Egypt, a moderate one that engages in politics and debate, and an extremist radical one that detaches from society and uses violence. </p> <p>But this is not a mere assault on the Brotherhood. As I began writing this piece I called my friend again to inquire about other websites and it turned out that all blogs of young Egyptian activists are restricted.</p> <p>It seems that Egypt's regime could no longer tolerate the escalating number of scandals revealed by free press, whether online or in print, so it has decided to lower the bar of tolerance in print newspaper and restrict access to online publications. </p> <p>A few weeks ago, Ibrahim Eissa, the outspoken editor of the independent newspaper <a href=\"http://dostor.org/ar/\">Al Dostoor</a> was sentenced to two months in prison after being convicted of \"spreading false rumors regarding the president's health\", although he was later <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7656022.stm\">pardoned</a>. A few months earlier, <a href=\" http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6998564.stm\">four newspaper editors</a> were sentenced to a year in prison after being accused of \"attacking ruling figures\". Thanks to domestic and international pressures, none of these had to serve their sentences. Yet the message was clearly delivered: democracy spring is over. </p> <p>This assault on journalists will probably affect their willingness to reveal other scandals, and hold the government and ruling elite responsible for the deteriorating political, economic and social conditions in Egypt. </p> <p>Internet access in public utilities in Egypt is also not as easy as it was a few months ago, when I used to check my email wherever I stopped to have a cup of coffee or some food. A couple of months ago, I was waiting for a friend in a cafe when I tried to access my email. There was no connection, so I called the waiter and asked whether I have to pay a fee for the internet. He said that the internet was still free, but that I needed to register at the cashier, and a password would be sent to my mobile phone. \"These are orders from the state security apparatus,\" he said. In other words, they need to have my phone number to identify me, and identify websites I decide to access.</p> <p>A few days later I tried to use a new mobile phone line but it didn't work. When I called customer service to complain, the operator apologised, and said they could only activate it when they have all my information. I told him I would rather stay anonymous and that this was specifically why I was using another line, because I wanted only a few people to access me though that line. He said that \"these are orders from the state security apparatus\", and that I could not use my phone otherwise. </p> <p>As my friend arrived at the cafe, I told him about the ridiculous new policy. He told me that only a few days earlier, he had followed a link to a news report on <a href=\"http://ikhwanweb.com/\">Ikhwanweb.com</a>, the Muslim Brotherhood's official English website, and only a couple of minutes later a state security agent was at the cafe's gate, checking who was accessing the website.</p> <p>All that comes only a few months after the notorious document, known as the <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/02/15/africa/ME-GEN-Egypt-Arab-Media.php\">\"Charter of Principles\"</a>, was drafted by Arab information ministers in Cairo last February. The draft calls for the prohibition of attacking all ruling and religious figures. It states that it upholds and respects freedom of speech but, as always, the devil lies in the details. The document associates this freedom with \"respecting individuals' rights and privacy\", \"not promoting radical ideas\" and \"protecting the supreme interests of the countries\". One can only imagine how these broad concepts could be used under Egypt's repressive regime. </p> <p>Sarcastically, the regime that calls for respecting individuals' privacy is the very same regime that violates this privacy in endless ways, the least of which is mentioned in this piece.</p> <p>With an extra mile of effort, Egypt's regime could probably almost fully undermine the freedom of speech, but this would also mean restricting internet access, and therefore detaching Egypt from the world politically, economically and socially. </p> <p>And whereas the assault on free press may lower the complaining and criticising voices in Egypt, it does absolutely nothing to resolve the epidemic social, economic and political illnesses of the country, which will eventually burst into something no one wants to see.</p>",
  "<p>Campaigning for Barack Obama in the still warm and sunny battle-ground of Virginia, what lessons are there for British politics in this historic election?</p> <p>1) First, find your Tony Blair. Watching Obama give a long <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/30/rachel-maddow-interviews_n_139402.html\">interview to Rachel Maddow</a>, a woman who the BBC could hire tomorrow to show how political talk shows can be interesting and fun, I was struck by his uncanny resemblance to Blair. It was time to get past tit-for-tat politics, said Obama. Capitalism was OK. The Republican party had many fine people in it, the Democratic candidate declared. Obama is as devout a Christian as he is devoted family man. Welcome to Barack Blair!</p> <p>2) Speak well. The old rules of rhetoric never go away. Obama is a terrific public orator. Every time he stands at a podium, still, slim and in control of his body as he speaks without notes in short, effective sentences he exudes command and control. By contrast, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/01/davidcameron.toryconference1\">David Cameron's conference speech</a> this year was as interesting as John McCain's Tory conference speech in 2007.</p> <p>3) If you are a Conservative, be one. McCain is tarred with being the continuation of Bush-Cheney years by other means. In fact, he opposed much of the Bush ideology over the years. His latest TV advert shows Obama praising McCain for initiating environmental legislation in the Senate. This makes Obama look good but dismays American rightwing voters who don't like to see their man hugging the enemy close.</p> <p>4) Gear up for door-to-door canvassing. Spending time with Democrats gives the lie to the view that American elections are all about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/30/uselections2008-barackobama-4m-30-minute-infomercial\">big money and TV campaigning</a>. They are but the intensity of phone canvassing and door knocking is greater than I have ever seen in the UK outside byelections. Canvassers have handheld personal data machines that allow instant transfers of voters' intentions and interests. As I write friends are taking leave from work to drive hours to North Carolina to get out the vote in a state where Obama and McCain are neck and neck.</p> <p>5) Hit greed but love business. Obama lashes Wall Street but talks up Main Street. Small businesses are the new working unrich in America. The Tories chez nous are now the party of the super-wealthy as the millionaires' frontbench presided over by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/27/osborne-tories-deripaska-mandelson\">Oligarch Osborne</a> and super-rich Cameron demonstrate. But Labour can come dangerously close to being anti-business especially in the rhetoric from those looking to a post-election leadership fight.</p> <p>6) Be tough on international issues. Obama wants to <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jnI2PmONXtYeD7lMyxUPK4Y5gEGg\">increase troop commitments</a> in Afghanistan and has taken India to task over <a href=\"http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/PoliticsNation/Obamas_remark_on_solving_Kashmir_dispute_welcome/articleshow/3664967.cms\">Kashmir</a> where nearly a million Indian and Pakistani soldiers face off against each other, instead of the latter being transferred to Pakistan's western borders to help uproot Islamist jihadists seeking to reconquer Afghanistan to close down every girls' school. His vice-presidential running mate, Joe Biden, is friend and supporter of Georgia's Mikheil Saakashvili in contrast to Tory footsying around with Russian money or Tories on the Council of Europe collaborating with Kremlin puppets. Obama wants to work with Europe as a whole, not deal one by one with EU member states rejecting European unity as in the Hague-Cameron vision of Europe. His promise of an undivided Jerusalem as the eternal capital of Israel is a further example of a foreign affairs approach that his mixed-message language on Iraq should not occult.</p> <p>7) Don't invite losers to speak at your party conference. Cameron cosied up to McCain who has been the only major international speaker at the Tory conference since Cameron became leader. At least one Tory shadow cabinet member has been spotted sitting with Republicans at the McCain-Obama debates. While some Tory MPs keep Obama buttons in their pockets and I came across a Tory activist working for Obama, the Cameron-McCain link is another example of Cameron's shallow judgment on international politics.</p> <p>8) Talks about individuals not just families. Obama has dropped the tired Clinton line about hard-working families and now talks of hard-working Americans. This is right. In Britain, 30% of households are not family units. They are single people, widows, the divorced, parents alone. Tax policy now has to focus on the individual as much as the family.</p> <p>9) Don't promise too much. Obama is riding two waves. One is the deep sense of despair mixed with shame that the Bush-Cheney years have done so little for America at home and abroad. The second is a deeper tide-of-history movement that is bringing to an end the long 30-year era of global market capitalism which begun with the arrival of Thatcher and Reagan just as they ended the 30-year era of welfare state capitalism initiated after 1945. Americans hope Obama will be the new Roosevelt. He may be a new Carter. But underneath the rhetoric of change, Obama is centrist, cautious and careful in limiting specific pledges. But he is offering a tax cut to all middle- and working-class Americans.</p> <p>10) Don't fall for populism. Obama exudes thought and intellect. He can speak clearly and vividly. He acknowledges differences and seeks to bridge them, not use the culture and other wars throbbing in American civil society as a vehicle for partisan point-scoring. The arrival of 50 million non-Americans in the last 15 years as legal or illegal migrants has provoked political storms across the red (Republican)-blue (Democrat) divide. In Britain there is a loser-takes-all auction between politicians on immigration. Obama refuses to play that populist card and British politics could learn from him.</p>",

Photograph: Miguel Villagran/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Miguel Villagran/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The newly-constructed American University of Afghanistan was supposed to herald a new era in Afghan-American relations. Instead, its affluent students are regular targets for attack and attempted kidnappings in an increasingly unstable Kabul. Some now believe foreign forces should leave and the Taliban come back into government.</p> <p>\"I think we have almost reached the point of no return. There are no good solutions left,\" said Ali Padsha, 19, who was raised in America. \"The longer foreign forces stay, the more problems will be created. When we [Afghans] see foreign forces in our country, it makes us crazy, it always has.</p> <p>\"The new Taliban are smarter than before and not as hardcore. They know what to do to keep the people happy.\"</p> <p>Seven years after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan, the situation is deteriorating rapidly. \"The rivers are running backwards,\" has become a popular lament in Kabul, whose residents are now looking to a change of leadership in America as the starting point for change in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Afghans generally favour Barack Obama. Some like him because he is the son of a Muslim, affectionately referring to him as Hussein Jan, adding Jan (an Afghan term of endearment) to his middle name. Many educated Afghans believe he has a more nuanced understanding of the regional predicament and support his plans to get tough with Pakistan. But others are cynical, seeing no difference between the candidates and viewing both men's commitment to sending more troops with hostility.</p> <p>Afghans face elections next year and are aware that the new American leader will play a defining role in determining who will be the next Afghan president. </p> <p>\"Whoever takes over America must bring a new leadership to Afghanistan,\" says Fahim Dashti, the editor of the popular Kabul Weekly. The victor will also have to work to counter the country's rampant anti-Americanism.</p> <p>\"The US has failed on everything they said they would do,\" says Dashti, a popular and influential thinker who fought with the Northern Alliance supported by America to drive out the Taliban in 2001.</p> <p>\"They said they were going to get rid of the Taliban - now the Taliban are at the edges of the city and even operating inside Kabul itself. They said they were going to end opium production but there is more opium than ever being produced. They said they were going to bring democracy but what we have is more like a dictatorship. Most people live beneath the poverty line and there is mass unemployment.\"</p> <p>Ali and his university friends are sympathetic to the incoming president. \"I feel bad for whoever wins this election,\" he said. \"They are going to have a really hard job cleaning up the mess left by the previous administration.\"<br><strong>Clancy Chassay</strong></p> <h2>Paris: 'Obama is France's ideal of the American dream'</h2> <p>Paris's Rue La Fayette, named after the great French hero of American independence, is known for its hordes of shopping US tourists. But struggling bars, hotels and even famous department stores are lamenting a fall in trade as US tourist numbers in Paris shrink to a record low. \"Business is down, we're all suffering,\" said Lionel Pinheiro, a waiter at one bistro. \"If Obama wins, I hope it might ease the financial crisis and bring the tourists back.\"</p> <p>Liberal Americans abroad have grown tired of having to apologise for their nationality during the Bush years. But France is now wondering: is it OK to start loving Americans again?</p> <p>\"We don't lynch Americans in the street,\" said Charlotte Lepri, a US specialist at the French thinktank, Institute for Research in Integrated Strategies (IRIS). \"But there are certain associations with Bush. Now there is a turnaround and real enthusiasm for a black candidate who represents France's ideal of the American dream.\"</p> <p>This new optimism could make it easier for the pro-US French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, to deepen rapprochement with Washington if Obama is elected. The latest poll shows over 70% of French people would vote for Obama. </p> <p>So great is the myth surrounding Obama, that some analysts warn the public could be in for a shock. The war in Afghanistan, France's increase in troops there and the growing death toll have unsettled public opinion. But few appear to realise that an Obama presidency will ask for more military involvement from allies. \"I don't think all French voters are aware of this part of his project, and they are going to get a surprise,\" said Jacques Mistral of the French Institute of International Relations (IFRI).<br><strong>Angelique Chrisafis</strong></p> <h2>Baghdad: 'The Republicans must finish their commitment'</h2> <p>Dr Amira Edan al-Dabab, above, has spent the past five years picking up the pieces of Iraq's plundered past and fears the results may again be lost if America elects Barack Obama.</p> <p>Since the fall of Baghdad in 2003, Edan, the director of the Iraqi Heritage and Antiquities Directorate, has been travelling the globe in search of up to 15,000 looted relics that used to comprise the essence of the National Museum of Iraq, treasures from three millennia which etched Iraq's place in the Arab heartland.</p> <p>Through half a decade of occupation, several years of brutal insurgency and attempts at sectarian cleansing, Iraq has seen tens of thousands of people killed, and at least two million leave. Security has improved and so too have prospects for some. But throughout Baghdad, many like Edan believe the country could again find itself at the edge of the precipice if the US doesn't tend to unfinished business.</p> <p>\"The Republicans must finish their commitment to Iraq, especially by signing the security treaty,\" she said. \"McCain is going to win,\" she continued. \"I read that the other man nominated is going to pull out the troops. We wish, we need and we hope that this won't happen.\"</p> <p>Most Iraqis seem more concerned about the short term. The time, they say, is not even nearly ripe for the Americans to leave and - for now - they'd rather the devil they know.</p> <p>Twenty kilometres north of Baghdad, the Tarmeya and Qadr district was until earlier this year the most active spot in the most dangerous area of Iraq. But the worm has turned. Tarmeyah is no longer an al-Qaida safe haven and McCain is seen as the best bet to keep it that way. </p> <p>\"If they go now, we may as well all leave too,\" said Bassam Jassam, from the region's dominant tribe, the Mashadani. \"McCain is best for us now. But we need to get through the next two years and after that all the Americans can leave.\"</p> <p>\"The thing we need is stability and strength,\" said Edan. \"If that goes, and it could, all of this could go again. There is so much at stake for us.\"<br><strong>Martin Chulov</strong></p> <h2>Beijing: 'America is going down while China is rising up'</h2> <p>Rao Jin has a soft spot for Barack Obama; he's drawn to his friendly face as well as admiring his personal achievements. But the hero of young Chinese nationalists stops well short of an endorsement.</p> <p>\"I hope the next president can really change the way the US deals with things, always using weapons or economic sanctions,\" says the 24-year-old founder of anti-CNN.com. \"The election has been a hot topic on our site. [But] one individual can't change much. Both Obama and McCain are standing for certain interest groups, and both of them will serve for America's benefit.\"</p> <p>Rao's website became a rallying point for fenqing (\"angry youth\") after the international storm over Tibet this year. He says it is not nationalist; merely a counterweight to western media bias and hegemony.</p> <p>For many in China, the US epitomises Occidental aggression and hypocrisy: preaching free trade but practising protectionism; idealising democracy while allowing vast donations; using human rights to justify invading Iraq.</p> <p>Some hope that Obama's mixed parentage and peripatetic childhood have made him more sympathetic to other cultures. He's popular among the young and there's fascination at the prospect of a black president - and what that would say about US tolerance of differences.</p> <p>But younger people are not counting on America to change itself. Many see the end of its global dominance as inevitable, given China's growing economic and international power.</p> <p>\"America is going down, while China is rising up,\" said Rao. Hu Ben, erstwhile Chinese subtitler for The West Wing and international editor for a major portal, added: \"A lot of young people still think America is our enemy. They're quite happy with the sub-prime crisis - they think this is China's chance.\"</p> <p>Officials and analysts also seem relaxed about the election result. The \"China card\" has been waved less often in this race than previous campaigns. They sense an emerging, broadly optimistic bipartisan consensus on Sino-US relations. John McCain appears more hawkish on security issues and relations with Taiwan, but Obama seems tougher on trade, Tibet, human rights and environmental protection.</p> <p>\"There will be differences on detailed issues, but the big picture won't change whoever wins,\" predicted Jin Canrong, associate dean of the School of International Studies at Renmin University.<br><strong>Tania Branigan</strong></p> <h2>Moscow: 'We don't beg from the west any more'</h2> <p>With its padded vinyl seats, chrome fittings and Wurlitzer jukebox, the famous Starlite Diner is a little corner of small-town America right in the heart of Moscow. When it opened in 1994, Russia was reeling in post-Soviet turmoil and was trying to court the west for much-needed investment.</p> <p>\"That's all changed now,\" said Sergei Demidov, 35, a banker, tucking into a plate of tenderloin steak and fries. \"We don't beg from the west any more and Washington can't order us around like it did in the 1990s.\"</p> <p>Relations between the US and a resurgent Russia hit a post-cold war low this summer after a fierce proxy conflict in former Soviet Georgia. Most Russians see the US as an aggressive bully that wants to encircle and weaken their country - regardless of whether a Democrat or a Republican is in charge.</p> <p>Barack Obama, however, is widely perceived as the lesser of two evils. A survey in October by Moscow's Levada Centre polling agency showed that 35% of Russians supported Obama, with 14% for John McCain and 37% confessing no sympathy for either. \"Obama would be better,\" said Maria Balandina, 26, an arts events manager. \"He's a democrat, he was against the war in Iraq, he's young.\"</p> <p>Former Vietnam pilot McCain, on the other hand, has called for Russia to be ousted from the G8 for allegedly backsliding on democracy and famously claimed he saw only the letters K-G-B in the eyes of Vladimir Putin (unlike George Bush, who thought he glimpsed the Russian leader's soul).</p> <p>However, observers say Obama's messianic zeal for reform inside America may not transform into a clear foreign policy. McCain, while a tough talker, might be more convenient for Kremlin hardliners who identify with his blunt rhetoric. \"Obama represents a new challenge for Moscow,\" said Andrei Kortunov, an analyst from the New Eurasia foundation. \"I'm just not sure Russia is ready for that challenge quite yet.\" <br><strong>Tom Parfitt</strong></p> <h2>Tehran: 'I'm not optimistic it will make much difference'</h2> <p>Rhythmic chants of \"Marg bar Amrika\" - \"death to America\" - boomed from loudspeakers in the streets as the crowd warmed up for Friday prayers, in an event unchanged since the 1979 revolution.</p> <p>Ayatollah Mohammad Emami-Kashani, frail but imposing in the white turban and brown robes of a senior cleric, lambasted \"global arrogance\". That is shorthand for the US, but he spells it out anyway. \"The claims the US makes against Iran are wrong. The world is waking up to its lies.\"</p> <p>Weekly prayers combine politics and religion, agitprop with faith. Mullahs, militiamen and civilians, including schoolchildren, are bussed in to sit on the mosque's pale green carpets. Women in black chadors are kept separate behind a screen. Kashani does not mention Barack Obama, though there is plenty of discussion of whether victory for him will do anything to improve relations between these old enemies.</p> <p>Iran's nuclear ambitions - which it insists are peaceful - and its role and influence in Iraq, Lebanon and Palestine, have kept it locked in confrontation with the US since George Bush included the Islamic republic in his \"axis of evil\" address in 2002. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, seemed to be signalling no change ahead last week when he called Iran's dispute with America \"deep-seated\". </p> <p>Still, Mohammad Khatami, the reformist former president, has spoken of \"new possibilities\" if Obama wins. Parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani found the Illinois senator \"more rational\" than John McCain.</p> <p>By coincidence, the word obama is close to the Farsi for \"with us,\" though few believe a Democratic victory will be enough to draw the sting from this relationship. Some think all the change must come from the US side - an unlikely prospect. \"I'm not optimistic it will make much difference to Iran,\" Mohsen Rezaei, ex-commander of the Revolutionary Guards, told the Guardian.</p> <p>Others hope it will. \"The countries that have good relations with the US see the benefits,\" said Mehdi, a young consultant, walking past Tehran's \"nest of spies\" - the old US embassy, still festooned in angry slogans. \"We should consider that.\"<br><strong>Ian Black</strong></p> <h2>Lahore: 'McCain understands the Pakistan reality better'</h2> <p>The liberal elite at Pakistan's most prestigious university, which offers American-style business education, look like their peers anywhere around the world. Except here many are backing John McCain.</p> <p>The students at the Lahore University of Management Sciences are not drawn to McCain as a person, saying that Barack Obama is far more appealing, but many believe McCain will be better for Pakistan, a view that is widely held across the country.</p> <p>It all goes back to Obama's statement that he would order unilateral and immediate strikes against Osama bin Laden in Pakistan if intelligence pointed to him being present in the country.</p> <p>\"Obama has stated, so clearly, that 'I'm going to attack Pakistan',\" said economics student Motahar Saleheen, between classes at the sprawling LUMS campus. \"One nation should not be allowed to interfere with the sovereignty of another.\"</p> <p>In Pakistan, Obama's remarks have been distilled down to a commitment to \"bomb Pakistan\", causing fury in a country fearful of becoming the next theatre of war in Washington's anti-terror fight.</p> <p>\"Tomorrow, if Obama attacks Pakistan, we will all rise up to defend ourselves, and the western media will brand us all terrorists,\" said fellow student Shahzad Mehboob.</p> <p>Even before Obama's position on Pakistan was known, there has long been a belief in the county that Republicans are more Pakistan-friendly than Democrats, rooted in the massive financial and military aid provided by he Eisenhower, Reagan and Bush presidencies to Islamabad.</p> <p>Pakistan has been a key ally of the Bush administration, which heavily backed the military-led regime of former president Pervez Musharraf, so the change in US president could have a profound impact on the country.</p> <p>\"John McCain understands the Pakistan reality better,\" said politics undergraduate Osama Khawar. \"But as a human being Obama is a better candidate. It's a dilemma for us.\"<br><strong>Saeed Shah</strong></p> <h2>Nairobi: 'Whether you're black or white, vote for Barack'</h2> <p>For reggae fans there is Makadem, for rock, Extra Golden. Folk lovers have Kenge Kenge while Tony Nyadundo offers a more traditional sound.</p> <p>All have recently released songs in Kenya with a common word in the title - Obama - and a similar message.</p> <p>\"If you're voting for real change, Barack Obama be the right man, whether you're black or white, young or old, vote for Barack, Barack Obama,\" sings Makadem, who launched the video for \"Obama be thy name\" at Nairobi's National Theatre last week.</p> <p>Obama-mania in Kenya is no surprise. The Democratic candidate's late father was Kenyan, and many of his relatives, including his 87-year-old step-grandmother Mama Sarah, still live here. Neither is it a recent phenomenon; during his Obama's trip to Kenya in 2006, thousands turned out to see him.</p> <p>But the presidential campaign has lifted the excitement to a new level. Obama's face now appears on many of the ubiquitous Matatu minibus taxis, thousands of bumper stickers bear his name. Locally printed campaign T-shirts are selling fast; one features the slogan \"Ndio Tunaweza\" - Swahili for \"Yes we can\". A musical based on Obama's memoir is set to open. Underlying the enthusiasm, is aspiration: many people still believe strongly in the American dream; Kenya has more students studying in the US than any other African country. And Obama, whose father travelled to Hawaii on a scholarship, is the ultimate embodiment of that immigrant dream.</p> <p>Policy-wise, a more nuanced US approach to terrorism issues, especially in places like Somalia, might be expected. But the biggest change may be intangible. One Kenyan columnist wrote this week an Obama win would unleash a \"momentum of enlightenment\" proving that talent and character rather than ethnicity and power should determine success.<br><strong>Xan Rice</strong></p> <h2>Gaza: 'Without pressure on Israel there's no solution'</h2> <p>Only a few years ago the bright yellow and orange al-Awda Factory for Biscuits and Ice Cream was a vibrant business and one of the largest factories in the Palestinian territories. Today, like most private firms in the Gaza Strip, it is in dire trouble.</p> <p>Only one of four production lines is working. There are barely two-dozen staff producing packets of hazelnut-flavoured wafers. There is not enough ink to print a sell-by date, not enough cardboard boxes to hold the packets, not enough plastic to wrap the boxes. When the wafers are delivered, they arrive at stores in old fruit cartons. Sales are down to 25% of what they were eight years ago. And this is a good day - for the previous week all production lines were shut down for want of ingredients, packaging and spare parts.</p> <p>The factors that have brought the biscuit factory to such a parlous state will be one of many unenviable Middle East challenges awaiting the new president.</p> <p>Since the Islamist movement Hamas won Palestinian elections in 2006 and then took full control of Gaza last year, Israel has gradually increased the pressure on what it calls the \"hostile entity\". It has severely limited imports and prohibited all exports. Few of Gaza's 1.5 million people can ever leave. Despite this, Hamas grows steadily stronger, not weaker.</p> <p>Like many Gazans, Mohammed Telbani, the factory's general manager, says he has little interest in the election. \"Presidents have changed but no one did anything for us,\" he said, waving his hand dismissively. He doubts that a new president will have the power or the will to reverse decades of US policy in the Middle East which he, like most here, sees as decisively pro-Israeli. \"Without pressure on Israel there won't be any solution to the problem,\" he said.</p> <p>If they had to choose, most Palestinians, like most other Arabs, would probably side with Obama (and, conversely, opinion polls show more Israelis would side with McCain). Gazans talk urgently about the need to lift the economic blockade of the strip, to allow the crossings to open and the economy to restart. Palestinians as a whole simply want Washington to play a much tougher role as a Middle East peace broker, bringing concrete change and eventually that much-promised independent Palestinian state.<br><strong>Rory McCarthy</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday November 3 2008.

  "<p>MPs will tomorrow debate the employment bill and have a chance to right a wrong. In 2002, Aslef sought to expel a BNP member from its membership. This led to a legal battle that culminated in a 2007 ruling by the European court of human rights that British trade unions, like religious groups and political parties, had the right to regulate their membership to include only those who share their beliefs and ideology. In doing so they determined that unions should be allowed to expel fascists from their ranks.</p> <p>The employment bill was meant to incorporate this ruling into British law. Unfortunately, it has fallen well short of what was required. Loose wording and additional provisions have meant that the bill, if enacted into law, would leave the unions in a worse legal position than before. </p> <p>Trade unions should have the right to exclude people, such as active fascists, whose views are diametrically opposed to the ethos of trade unionism without fear of legal or financial penalties. The bill, as it currently stands, is simply a further regulation of a union's freedom of association and autonomy. The Trade Union Group of Labour MPs, led by Tony Lloyd, has put down an amendment that would properly enforce the court's ruling. By backing New Clause 6, MPs will not only be doing what is legally and morally right but they will save the government further embarrassment and legal challenges which will undoubtedly emerge in the future.<br><strong>Tony Woodley </strong>Unite,<strong> Dave Prentis </strong>Unison,<strong> Billy Hayes </strong>CWU, <strong>Mark Serwotka </strong>PCS, <strong>Keith Norman </strong>Aslef, <strong>Michael J Leahy </strong>Community, <strong>Bob Crow </strong>RMT, <strong>Gerry Doherty </strong>TSSA, <strong>Mike Bradley</strong> GFTU, <strong>John Hannett</strong> Usdaw</p>",
  "<p>Psychiatric units are experiencing major problems with implementation of the NHS smoking ban. Although this was implemented in other parts of the NHS last year, there was a delay until July 1 this year for psychiatric units in recognition that they would face specific difficulties.</p> <p>Despite the additional time to prepare, a number of unforeseen consequences of the ban have occurred. Most alarmingly, the frequency of \"small\" fires on psychiatric units has increased sharply. At the mental health trust where I work, the frequency of fires has quadrupled since the start of the ban, from about one fire every two months to two fires a month. At the same time the sensitivity of smoke detectors on psychiatric wards at our trust has been reduced in an attempt to reduce the number of \"false alarms\" triggered by smoking in enclosed areas and unnecessary calls to the fire brigade.</p> <p>The increase in the number of fires is thought to be the result of patients no longer being supervised smoking in a \"smoking room\" and instead resorting to smoking in their bedrooms and the toilets. Whereas previously patients' cigarettes would either be lit by staff or from a wall-mounted lighter, there is now widespread possession of lighters and matches by patients, and patients are easily able to circumvent body searches.</p> <p>On October 15, a fire at Camlet Lodge secure psychiatric unit in north London caused an estimated \u00a360m of damage and the evacuation of 60 patients to another facility; fortunately, no one was injured. Camlet Lodge is a modern purpose-built unit meeting current fire standards. Unfortunately, many psychiatric units are still housed in old Victorian buildings.</p> <p>Staff in the frontline of implementing the smoking ban are at a loss what to do. Attempts to raise this issue with hospital managers at my trust have not produced any practical solution, as managers feel their hands are tied by the Health Act 2006. Surely it was not parliament's intention when they passed the smoking ban to cause risk to life and limb. Public debate on this issue is urgently required before there is a significant loss of life in a fire at an NHS psychiatric hospital.<br><strong>Dr John Dent</strong><br>Consultant psychiatrist, London </p> <p>Major changes to the Mental Health Act come into effect today. The new legislation represents an important milestone in the reform of mental health care in England, backing up changes to services, led by frontline staff, that have transformed community care.</p> <p>In particular, a new legal power, supervised community treatment, will ensure better care for a minority of patients who, because of illness, stop taking their medication and are therefore vulnerable and at risk. By continuing treatment at home following discharge from hospital, patients can stay well and rebuild their lives.</p> <p>We are aware that some patients are worried about these changes. We can assure them that clinicians will use their powers fairly and for the benefit of service users and their families.<br><strong>Professor Dinesh Bhugra </strong>President, Royal College of Psychiatrists, <strong>Professor Louis Appleby </strong>National director for mental health, Department of Health</p> <p>I was deeply saddened to read the highly offensive analogy Simon Hoggart (November 1) drew between the current \"panic-stricken headlines\" - particularly concerning the recent media row over Ross and Brand's telephone call to Andrew Sachs - and people diagnosed with bipolar affected disorder: \"We in the media seem to veer wildly between apocalyptic prophecies of doom and minuscule trivia, like manic depressives on a day out from the hospital.\"</p> <p>Oh how terribly witty and erudite you are, Simon. As a woman living in the community and having to face every day the ignorance and prejudice surrounding mental illness and bipolar affected disorder (yes, many of us with mental health issues actually live and work alongside you and - heaven forbid - may even be members of your own family), I was appalled that such a comment could appear in a paper I had previously respected. That this comment was allowed to stand unedited is especially ironic when it was used in connection to a story concerning other offensive remarks made in the media. <br><strong>Sarah Pottle</strong><br>Harlow, Essex</p>",
  "<p>Ignorance of the law is no excuse. It may seem artificial and unjust, but everyone is assumed to know the law that governs whatever they're doing. But in fairness and logic, you can only get to know the law if there's somewhere you can ascertain what it is. Only in totalitarian states and in Kafka's novel The Trial can people be dealt with under laws which they've been prevented from finding out. You don't expect England and Wales to join that company. </p> <p>Last week, an obscure case on a technical legal point exposed an alarming failure to meet the condition that the law must be accessible to all. Moreover, as an angry and worried appeal court judge, Lord Justice Toulson, made clear, the problem was not confined to the narrow area of law in that particular case. It raised a far wider issue. </p> <p>I need not bore you with the details of the appeal which brought the matter into the open. It's enough to say that it was about making a court order against a convicted fraudster, confiscating the money he made from his crime. But by sheer accident, the day before the appeal court was to give its decision - that such a confiscation order was valid - the three appeal judges found out that the regulation which was at the heart of the legal argument had in fact been repealed as long ago as 2001. It was no longer the law, but none of the lawyers in the case, nor the judge who'd given the original decision, nor the three judges in the appeal had known this. </p> <p>Inquiries have already revealed other court rulings based on that same regulation, without anyone realising that it had long ceased to be. That's ignorance of the law gone wild, but there's an excuse, and it's one which does no credit to the English legal system. </p> <p>To put it bluntly, it was almost impossible to find out exactly what the law said. Lord Justice Toulson pointed out that most of our law today is not contained in acts of parliament but in secondary legislation, regulations and the like. On many subjects the law can't be found in one place, but in a patchwork. \"There is no comprehensive statute law database with hyperlinks which would enable an intelligent person, by using a search engine, to find out all the legislation on a particular topic.\" </p> <p>He went on: \"It is profoundly unsatisfactory if the law itself is not practically accessible ... even to the courts whose constitutional duty it is to interpret and enforce it.\" </p> <p>What particularly concerns Toulson is that this \"lamentable state of affairs\" affects many areas of law which have great impact on the ordinary citizen, including sensitive childcare issues and social security benefits. There is a laudable government project to create a single, free, online legislation service which would bring together all the bits and pieces of a particular law. The trouble is that progress has been slow, it's costing a lot of money and in the meantime new legislation is proliferating at unprecedented speed. </p> <p>The age-old maxim may need to be revised - ignorance of the law is no excuse, unless there's no way of finding out what the law is.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Tuesday November 4 2008</strong></p> <p>The Mail's parent company no longer has a stake in the commercial radio group GCap. Global Radio took over GCap earlier this year</p> <p> </p> <p>Last week may have seemed just another in the long decline of print.</p> <p>In America, Gannett, the largest newspaper publisher (and owner of the British Newsquest), proposed to lay off 10% of its workforce; Time Inc proposed to cut 600 jobs; the Christian Science Monitor dropped daily print publication. Here, the Wolverhampton Express and Star, the highest-selling regional paper, announced 10% cuts while Express Newspapers tried to persuade more than half its subeditors to volunteer or redundancy.</p> <p>But, in one respect, every newspaper employee in Britain should have felt a little bit more cheerful and positive about the future last week. Not for the first time, the Mail showed that, in this country at least, newspapers can still lead the news agenda and alter the national mood. The resignations of Russell Brand and Lesley Douglas, and the suspension of Jonathan Ross were a triumph both for the Daily Mail and its Sunday sister and for the papers' distinctive and, in many ways, quaint worldview. What is remarkable is not just that the Brand-Ross broadcast went unnoticed for seven days, but also that, even last Monday morning, after the Mail on Sunday had broken the story, most newsdesks still didn't see it as a big deal. The Guardian, Mirror and Express were among the papers that didn't follow it. The Sun put it on page 3, a sign that it rated it an entertaining curiosity and just another example of bad taste from a familiar quarter.</p> <p>Even the Mail - perhaps reluctant to go overboard on a story broken by a Sunday in the same house - didn't make it the splash, though it ran a front-page picture of Brand and inside, Melanie Phillips gave her usual imitation of a Victorian dowager who has overdosed on laudanum. Ross and Brand, she raved, were guilty of \"cruelty and indeed sadism\" and their behaviour was \"bordering on the psychopathic\". Her column attracted 209 comments (mostly anti-BBC) on the Mail website, the Sunday story 220 - numbers well above average. The Mail scented blood.</p> <p>Any MP able to string \"lewd\", \"offensive\" and \"disgusting\" into a coherent sentence was pursued for comment. \"Sack them!\" screamed the Mail's front page on Tuesday. The paper kept its teeth in the story to the end of the week, running a leader each day, and highlighting more examples of how the BBC was outraging \"decent people\", such as a show last week that made a \"disgracefully foul\" joke about the Queen. On Friday, Richard Littlejohn hailed \"a stunning victory over self-appointed, self-obsessed metropolitan narcissists who control so much of our public life\".</p> <p>Yes, I know. The Mail is hypocrisy on stilts. It claimed to find the broadcast offensive and hurtful to a 78-year-old man, but it ran the YouTube video of it on its website. It denounces cruelty and sadism while highlighting the tiniest physical flaws of anyone in the public eye, particularly women. It demands BBC heads should roll, but no Daily Mail executive was sacked when it was among 11 papers forced to apologise and pay damages to Robert Murat and two others over the Madeleine McCann case. It has a long-standing vendetta against the BBC but rarely mentions that its parent company has a stake in GCap, the UK's leading commercial radio group.</p> <p>Nevertheless, every editor - whatever his or her politics or position in the culture wars - can learn from the Mail's single-mindedness. Many young people adore Ross and Brand and won't thank the paper for hounding them off the airwaves. The Mail doesn't care. It reliably sets its face against what it sees as modish and insincere. It offers a view of the world - that everything has gone downhill since the 1950s, when women stayed in the kitchen, sex was saved for marriage and homosexuality was shameful - that is now rarely found elsewhere, not even in the Telegraph as that paper strives for a younger, trendier audience. It understands that one of a newspaper's functions is to give its readers a sense of security, belonging and simple values in an increasingly complex and unsettling world. The Mail is a supremely confident paper. Where others, trimming to focus groups, muffle their message, the Mail projects it relentlessly, and with great technical skill, from almost every page.</p> <p>The great strength of the British press is that it has a range of papers, each with its own character and identity. That explains why radio \"shock-jocks\" and internet bloggers don't have anything like the influence here that they have in America, where most newspapers are bland, characterless and cautious. </p> <p>If they are to survive, British papers need to preserve and develop their individuality. The Mail, in the past week, has shown them how.</p>",

  "<p>The defining goal of Gordon Brown's political career - the promotion of social mobility - is showing signs of progress after decades of stagnation, a government report will say today.</p> <p>A series of Labour initiatives targeted at the less well-off from the earliest years of life are beginning to have an impact, indicating that for the first time in three decades, children from disadvantaged backgrounds may be able to overtake their parents on the social ladder.</p> <p>The report by the Cabinet Office's strategy unit has found that \"positive changes\" started to occur around the year 2000 after decades in which children failed to overtake their parents or fell behind them.</p> <p>One key finding shows that family background is less important to the academic success of 15-year-olds now than it was for the same age group born in 1970.</p> <p>The report, drawing on academic research, will be welcomed by ministers who have faced criticism that, despite record investment by Labour in education, the government has failed to bridge the class divide. </p> <p>The report, Getting On, Getting Ahead, shows that the investment in early development and primary education may be paying off. It cites the \u00a35bn spent on early years development and childcare in 2007-08, which has led to double the number of childcare places. Progress is slow, however, because only 255 children's centres had opened by 2005. There are now 2,914.</p> <p>The report says: \"The benefits of higher quality pre-school are greater for boys, children with special educational needs and disadvantaged children.\"</p> <p>The report says that the importance of family background in determining GCSE results is less important for teenagers born in 1990-91 than it was for those born in 1970. It says: \"These findings suggest that family background will have less of an impact on the income of these children when they reach adulthood than those born in 1970. They are likely to experience higher social mobility.\"</p> <p>The report cited government investment in secondary education, notably the creation of city academies in deprived inner-city areas. It said Bangladeshi pupils had risen from being the lowest performers to being above average and academies had achieved results that were twice as good as those achieved by their predecessors.</p> <p>Liam Byrne, the Cabinet Office minister, will welcome the report. He will say: \"Despite the huge economic, social and political changes between 1970 and 2000, social mobility in Britain did not rise. Since 2000 new evidence suggests this might be beginning to change.\"</p> <p>Chris Grayling, the shadow work and pensions secretary, dismissed the report. He said: \"This has all the hallmarks of a government propaganda exercise. The reality in Britain today is that we have some of the lowest social mobility in the industrialised world. We have youth unemployment higher than it was a decade ago, the number of British people in work has been falling sharply over the past two years and official figures show that poverty is now rising steadily.\"</p> <h2>Main findings</h2> <p>\u2022 Social mobility was stagnant between 1970 and 2000</p> <p>\u2022 Inequalities that prevent social mobility are being addressed, with \"positive changes\" kicking in from 2000.

  "<p>British doctors are to launch a major clinical trial to investigate whether a common anti-depression drug could be a cheap and effective treatment for the devastating condition motor neurone disease.</p> <p>The trial, which is due to start in January, will follow more than 200 patients with motor neurone disease over 18 months to see if those given daily lithium pills live longer. Lithium is already licensed for treating manic depression and other mental disorders, and is extremely cheap, costing just 48p for a packet of 20 pills.</p> <p>The \u00a31m trial follows the publication in February of a small study by Italian researchers which suggested that lithium could slow the progression of the disease dramatically. The study sparked a surge of interest in the drug among online patient groups, and some GPs now offer lithium \"off-label\", despite widespread uncertainty as to whether it works.</p> <p>Nigel Leigh, director of the motor neurone disease care centre at King's College London, who will lead the trial, said: \"It is our responsibility and duty to carry out this trial because we have to consider every lead seriously, and where there is real uncertainty, resolve it swiftly. The results of the Italian trial are too dramatic to ignore.\"</p> <p>Motor neurone disease destroys nerves in the brain that control movement, leaving patients locked in a failing body. There is currently no cure and half die within 14 months of being diagnosed. In the UK, there are about 5,000 people with the condition. Stephen Hawking, the 66-year-old Cambridge physicist, was diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease 45 years ago. He is now almost completely paralysed, although, as with most other patients, his mind remains active. </p> <p>Doctors are unsure precisely how lithium works, but its effectiveness as an anti-depression treatment is thought to be linked to its ability to slow down electrical activity in brain cells. </p> <p>Doctors are now recruiting patients who experienced their first symptoms of the disease within the past six months to three years. Results from the trial are expected within two years. It will be considered a success if patients who are given the drug live 20% longer than those who receive a placebo. \"It would be very nice if we show lithium arrests the disease but we're not expecting that. We're hoping for a three- to six-month increase in lifespan over the 18-month trial,\" said Leigh.</p> <p>If the drug is effective, it could be given to thousands of patients immediately. But doctors advised patients against taking it until the trial was over. Taken unsupervised, it could put them at risk of side-effects including tremors, stiffness, confusion, kidney failure and damage to the thyroid gland, they warned.</p>",
  "<p>So it's here at last. The dawn of the dumb has broken in earnest. Two mistakes occur - first Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross overstep the mark with an ill-advised bit of juvenilia, then someone decides to broadcast it. Two listeners complained, but that's by the by: it shouldn't have gone out. But then the Daily Mail - not so much a newspaper as an idiot's guidebook issued in bite-size daily instalments - uses the incident as the starting point for a full-blown moral crusade. Suddenly everyone's complaining, whether they heard the broadcast or not, largely on the basis of hysterical, boggle-eyed descriptions of what the pair said. Poor Andrew Sachs, who, having been wronged, graciously accepted their apologies and called for everybody to move on, looked bewildered by the sheer number of cameras stuck in his face. Because, by then, apologies weren't enough.</p> <p>The Mail was so incensed, it printed a full transcript of the answerphone prankery under the heading \"Lest We Forget\" - and helpfully included outtakes that weren't even broadcast, so its readers could be enraged by things no one had heard in the first place. This was like making a point about the cruelty of fox-hunting by ripping a live fox apart with your bare hands, then poking a rabbit's eye out with a pen for good measure.</p> <p>And now, like a lion developing a taste for human flesh after munching on a bit of discarded leg, the paper is on the hunt for fresh victims. First up: Brand's Channel 4 comedy show Ponderland. Readers were treated to a blow-by-blow account of what kind of depravity they could expect to see if they tuned in that evening.</p> <p>\"As his closing joke, he performs a graphic mime of sexual acts on a butterfly.\"</p> <p>Funniest. Daily Mail sentence. Ever.</p> <p>Friday's paper included a rundown of other \"obscenities\" broadcast by the Beeb, which the paper fearlessly \"uncovered\" by recording some TV shows and writing down some of the jokes. To protect readers' sensibilities, all the rude words were sprinkled with asterisks, although since the Mail's definition of \"rude\" extends to biological terms such as \"penis\", it was a bit like gazing at an ASCII representation of a snowstorm on a ZX Spectrum circa 1983. Perhaps next week it will produce a free sheet of asterisk stickers for readers to plaster over their own genitals, lest they catch sight of them in a mirror and indignantly vomit themselves into a coma.</p> <p>One of the shows singled out was an episode of the romcom Love Soup transmitted in April that, the Mail insisted, depicted a woman being raped by a dog. I didn't see the show myself, but I doubt you saw it going in or anything, because I don't recall seeing Mark Thompson hanging from a lamppost while an angry mob kicked Television Centre to pieces. Maybe we can \"devolve\" to that point in time for Christmas.</p> <p>Still, if it's OK to be retrospectively enraged, why stop at April? Be ambitious! Keep going! There's an endless list of comedy shows that would qualify for the Mail's hall of shame. How about Monty Python, which in 1970 included a gloriously tasteless sketch about a man eating his mother's corpse, then puking the remains into a grave? If Python had been banned, we'd never have seen Fawlty Towers or heard of Andrew Sachs in the first place - problem solved. Steptoe and Son, Till Death Us Do Part, Porridge, Not the Nine O'Clock News, The Young Ones, Have I Got News For You, Blackadder, The Day Today, Little Britain, The Thick of It ... by the Mail's reckoning, each of those shows surely deserves a place on the list too. Hundreds of hours of laughter you'd never have had.</p> <p>The sad, likely outcome of this pitiful gitstorm is an increase in BBC jumpiness. I have a vested interest in this, of course, because I've just started work on the next series of my BBC4 show Screen Wipe, on which we sometimes sail close to the wind. In the past, the BBC has occasionally stepped in to nix the odd line that oversteps the mark - as it should do, when parameters aren't out of whack.</p> <p>But when the Beeb's under fire, those parameters can change. Last year, following the \"fakery\" scandals, we recorded a trailer for the series in which I mocked a BBC4 ident featuring footage of seagulls, by fooling around with a plastic seagull on a stick and muttering about how you couldn't trust anything on TV any more. Pure Crackerjack. But suddenly it couldn't be transmitted, due to \"the current climate\". So God knows how restrictive things might get over the coming months.</p> <p>And that's just my basic, low-level gittery. If something as sublime and revolutionary as Python came along today, the Mail would try to kill it stone dead, and it'd rope in thousands of angry old idiots to help, all of them bravely marching to the Ofcom website to register their disgust. What a rush. Feel that pipsqueak throb of empowerment coursing through your starched and joyless veins! You've crushed some fun, and it feels good to be alive!</p> <p>Perhaps it's time to put a \"Complain to Ofcom\" button right there on the remote control: if enough viewers press it, the show gets yanked immediately, like a bad variety act being pulled off stage by a shepherd's crook.</p> <p>Or maybe, just maybe, it's time to establish \"Counter-Complaints\": a method of registering your complaint about the number of knee-jerk complaints. And one should cancel out the other - so if 25,000 people complain, and a further 25,000 counter-complain, the total number of complaints is zero. It might lead to a lot of fruitless button-mashing, but at least we can keep our shared national culture relatively sane. Because judging by the rest of the news, if the ship's going down, a few unrestricted taste-free laughs now and then might make things more bearable for all of us.</p> <p>\u2022 This week Charlie became so <strong>dismayed by the number of things in his flat that need fixing</strong>, that he contemplated doing nothing: \"And seeing how long it'll take for the entire structure to collapse.\"</p>",
  "<p>There is always money to be made out of someone else's distress. Lawyers are the usual suspects. But in these troubled times it is not only them but the courts that are coining it in. Small comfort for those involved but, with bankruptcies and repossessions soaring, at last the courts - facing cuts of \u00a3140m - are fulfilling one government target. The government wants them to be self-financing. For commercial work this plainly makes sense. Elsewhere, however, it risks being downright dangerous.</p> <p>Six months ago the government decided that family cases, such as care proceedings, should pay for themselves. That meant local authorities had to bear the full cost of childcare cases, entailing a 30-fold increase in costs where a full hearing was needed . The proposal was put out to consultation, but both the courts' budget and local authority spending had already been set on the assumption that the change would be made. In the next few weeks the high court will decide whether the government is in breach of its human rights obligation to ensure that children have access to justice. The case was brought by four local authorities, backed by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which believes that the new self-financing edict is putting children at risk.</p> <p>According to the Law Society - an interested party, but not necessarily wrong - the number of care cases has fallen by a quarter since the new system came in. That may be due to a new pre-hearing system designed to ensure that every avenue is explored before cases go to court. But it also means more children are going to grannies or aunts rather than foster parents. Desirable, perhaps. But if local authorities and the NSPCC thought so, they would hardly be spending scarce resources on a legal challenge. Protecting children is not discretionary spending: the NSPCC fears that some local authorities will lack the resources to take to court all the cases that need to be heard. Resorting to \"voluntary\" arrangements may further endanger children who have already suffered significant physical or emotional harm.</p> <p>Family courts, providing a vital public service, usually function below the radar, picking over private grief, negotiating with individuals who require patience, time and attention, and protecting some of the most vulnerable in society. Professionals tread a narrow and unenviable path in pursuit of the best interests of the child, knowing they will almost invariably disappoint someone else. Meanwhile, by the logic of the self-financing model, fewer cases coming to court means a gap in court budgets, and more pressure for all involved. Gatekeeping in the public services is always tricky. But there must be a better way than this.</p>",

Those statistics confirmed that the Swede's day was hardly a triumphant march along the tree-lined fairways of Europe's most manicured fairways, but then it didn't need to be as Harrington and Lee Westwood, his principal challengers in the race for the Harry Vardon trophy, faded at the end of a rain-interrupted event which sapped the energy and spirits of many, Karlsson included.</p> <p>\"This has been the hardest week I have ever experienced in golf,\" he said afterwards, admitting that he had found it hard to concentrate on his own game knowing that his fate might depend on the efforts of Harrington and Westwood.</p> <p>His heart might have skipped a beat yesterday morning when Westwood moved into a tie for the lead as the rain-delayed third round reached its conclusion. But good play from Kjeldsen and Kaymer brought peace of mind. \"In a situation like this it's a lot better to have a lot of guys fighting each other,\" he said.</p> <p>In the end Westwood bogeyed two holes on his back nine of the fourth round to let slip any chance of victory and assure Karlsson of the trophy. The Swede's prize-money total for the season, \u00a32.17m, was \u00a3218,000 more than that of second-placed Harrington, who remained sanguine. \"I know what this season is going to be remembered for in a week's time, a month's time and a year's time,\" said the Open and US PGA champion. \"I was not quite prepared going into this and I could see that ... but in the context of the season it's not that disappointing.\" </p> <p>Karlsson has won twice on the European tour this year and accumulated another 10 top-10 finishes - a record which tells of his supreme consistency as well as outstanding golf. He was also one of the few members of Nick Faldo's losing Ryder Cup team to emerge with his reputation enhanced. \"The Order of Merit is won over 12 months. Obviously it would have been fantastic to have capped it off with a good week but I'm not going to feel ashamed of finishing 32nd this week,\" he said. </p> <p>His overall triumph, which came on the same day his compatriot Annika Sorenstam won her 89th career title at the Suzhou Taihu Ladies Open in China, also ended one of the game's more curious anomalies: despite the enormous contribution of Scandinavian players to European golf in recent years, none had won the Order of Merit.</p> <p>Karlsson deserved to right that particular wrong, not least because of his efforts to transform himself and his golf. At one time he had a reputation as a hothead, now he exudes the calm of a Zen master after a long massage. His game, too, has stepped up several notches, so much so that, as Westwood pointed out the other day, he now goes into every major championship as one of the players to watch.</p> <p>Whether he can add one of golf's four biggest events to his season's victory will depend on his continued improvement, some luck and, as ever, the performances of others. Tiger Woods will be back in time for next year's Masters and Harrington, buoyed by his two major championship victories this year, is intent on winning his third in a row.</p>",
  "<p>From a small fleet of luxury yachts to mansions and chateaux scattered among the world's most exclusive resorts, the opulent lifestyle of Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich has been laid bare.</p> <p>In a 134-page ruling at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Mr Justice Christopher Clarke gave an intriguing glimpse into the lives of the super-rich, revealing a wealth of detail - from the Chelsea owner's labyrinthine business holdings to his intercontinental property portfolio and even the number of days he spent in the UK last year: 57.</p> <p>\"Abramovich is a billionaire,\" said Clarke. \"His overall wealth is said to be such that the \u00a330m that he spent on [property in Knightsbridge] represents less than 0.5% of his estimated net worth.\"</p> <p>The judgment came in the latest of a series of cases in English courts that have explored the opaque dealings of the billionaire Russian oligarchs who divide their time between London, Moscow and continental Europe.</p> <p>Abramovich, 42, was facing claims by the energy company Yugraneft that it was cheated out of its 50% stake in an oilfield in Siberia. Abramovich successfully fought off the \u00a32.5bn claim after the high court ruled that he was neither \"resident\" nor \"domiciled\" in Britain and therefore the case could not be heard here.</p> <p>\"He spends more time in Russia than anywhere else and his business and personal interests are focused on Russia,\" said the judge. \"Virtually all of the business associates with whom he is said to have dealt in these proceedings are Russian.\"</p> <p>To underpin the detailed legal argument the judge delved into the tycoon's private life, listing a host of multimillion-pound properties, yachts and planes to demonstrate the global nature of his business empire.</p> <p>Clarke said that seven years ago Abramovich had owned \"a chateau in France, some real estate in England and, elsewhere, a yacht, a plane and a helicopter\".</p> <p>Fast-forward to 2008 and his empire has expanded, according to the ruling delivered last week. \"[His assets are now] worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with properties acquired and renovated in the UK, France, Sardinia, the US and St Barts in the Caribbean, and Chelsea FC.\"</p> <p>Among his homes, three of four multimillion-pound properties in the UK were given to his ex-wife, Irina, as part of their divorce settlement last year.</p> <p>At one address in Lowndes Square, Knightsbridge, the court heard that the Russian has bought \"eight or nine flats\" which he reportedly plans to turn into a \u00a3150m house with bullet- and blast-proof windows and separate housing for staff and bodyguards. But the oligarch's English homes are just the tip of his international estate. The ruling revealed that outside the UK Abramovich also owns:</p> <p>\u2022 Two ski chalets in Colorado</p> <p>\u2022 A villa in St Barts</p> <p>\u2022 A French chateau</p> <p>\u2022 \"A grand historic house\" rented from the Russian government</p> <p>\u2022 Leonid Brezhnev's former home in Moscow</p> <p>Abramovich has a hectic schedule, flitting between Russia, the UK and Europe. In 2007, the court heard, he spent an average of just over a day and a half at a time in the UK, with his longest stay stretching 11 days, during which he attended four football matches. \"Such visits are not the sort that suggest an intention to make England one's usual or settled place of abode,\" noted the judge. \"In 2007 he spent only 57 full days here, virtually all in connection with football matches.\"</p> <p>The judge said a \"very large\" percentage of his visits to England were connected with Chelsea which he bought in 2003, rather than any personal or professional ties. Abramovich has poured hundreds of millions into the club but Clarke described his involvement as a \"hobby and a leisure interest ... It is not a business investment. The sums that Mr Abramovich has given to the club far exceed any return that could possibly be expected\".</p> <p>To facilitate his globetrotting trips between Stamford Bridge, Russia and the Caribbean, Abramovich makes use of private jets, helicopters and supercars. The court ruling said that he \"charters several yachts\" and \"leases aircraft for use when he is in England\". </p> <p>And according to press reports, his latest extravagance is entering its final phase in a German shipyard. For now, it simply goes by its codename, Project M-147, but when the covers come off the Eclipse in a few months' time, the 550ft-long, 12,000-tonne vessel is expected to be the world's largest privately-owned.</p> <h2>The road to riches</h2> <p>Roman Abramovich, who came to public attention in Britain when he bought <strong>Chelsea</strong> in <strong>2003</strong>, made his fortune in post-Soviet Russia. He became involved in <strong>oil export</strong> deals and in <strong>1995</strong> entered the ranks of the super-rich when with <strong>Boris Berezovsky</strong> he took over oil company <strong>Sibneft</strong> for a fraction of its market value. Abramovich gained increasing <strong>control</strong> over the business and got most of the money when it was sold in <strong>2005</strong> for <strong>\u00a37.5bn</strong>.

  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Wednesday November 5 2008</strong></p> <p>Lewis Hamilton was not the first Briton to win the Monaco grand prix since Jackie Stewart in 1969. Graham Hill won the race that year; Stewart and David Coulthard have won more recently.</p> <p>As a season strewn with errors and inconsistences from all the leading protagonists reached a pulsating climax yesterday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewishamilton\">Lewis Hamilton</a> did exactly what he needed to do. In difficult conditions he kept a cool head, stayed out of trouble, and got himself into position to grab the points he needed to ensure that those close to him would not be subjected to another season of acute hypertension.</p> <p>Now he has won his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone\">first title</a>, and there is no reason why he cannot add several more to join the great figures of the sport's post-war history. It is certainly not beyond the bounds of possibility that he will overtake Sir Jackie Stewart to become the first of Britain's nine world champions to take the title more than three times. By winning it 12 months after virtually throwing it away in a display of callowness, he will have added a layer of authority to his already remarkable confidence. </p> <p>Most of all, his rivals will be praying that he does not prove to be the figure capable of filling the shoes vacated two years ago by Michael Schumacher, who established a greater hold over formula one than any man since Juan Manuel Fangio in the 1950s. A Hamilton hegemony is a prospect dreaded by those who finished ahead of him on the track yesterday but trailed in the final standings.</p> <p>The effect of Schumacher's departure is the most plausible explanation for the wholesale errors that have made the 2008 season such an enthralling switchback ride, its outcome in doubt until the closing seconds. In the German's absence a group of drivers have vied for supremacy, without the benefit of the performance yardstick that the seven-times champion provided for so long. The opportunity to establish themselves as his successor induced many outbreaks of injudiciousness and overambition, and none of the current crop has yet learnt how to focus the efforts of a team in the way Schumacher did.</p> <p>Felipe Massa, who ran Hamilton so close, began the season by spinning out of the Australian and Malaysian grands prix. At that stage the Italian press was virtually unanimous in calling on the Ferrari management to replace him. But Massa would end the season with six victories, one more than Hamilton. \"Not bad for a wanker, eh?\" he said to a friend on Saturday after setting the time that gave him pole position in yesterday's race. After that terrible start he had thoroughly outshone his team-mate Kimi Raikkonen, the defending world champion, whose own errors restricted him to a pair of wins. </p> <p>Hamilton began the season as though all the lessons of his debut campaign had been learnt, the good and bad experiences absorbed. In Melbourne, where both Ferraris went out with engine problems, he controlled the race brilliantly, unflustered by three safety-car periods. The next two races, however, were severely disappointing. Fifth in Malaysia was followed by 13th in Bahrain, where he clumsily ran into the back of Fernando Alonso's Renault on the second lap. This was by some distance his worst display since arriving in formula one, and questions were being asked. Even worse, the Ferraris had regained their mechanical reliability. </p> <p>Three consecutive podium appearances for the McLaren team leader temporarily silenced the sceptics. Third behind the Ferraris in Barcelona and second behind Massa in Istanbul, Hamilton swept to victory in Monaco. On streets made treacherous by rain, all the zest and concentration appeared to have returned to his driving. He also made the most of a piece of luck when a brush with a barrier in the opening stages prompted an early pit stop to change a damaged rear wheel, which turned out to give him an unexpected strategic advantage. He became the first British driver to claim victory in the principality since Stewart in 1969. </p> <p>To receive the trophy on a track where his idol, Ayrton Senna, had won six times provoked an emotional response. \"This was the race I wanted to win more than any other in the world,\" he said. \"When I was a kid I looked at the tunnel, the swimming pool, it just looked spectacular so automatically it became my favourite race.\"</p> <p>In Montreal he blotted his copybook by driving into the back of the stationary Raikkonen while the Ferrari driver was waiting for the light to go green at the end of the pit lane. A 10-place grid penalty at the next race, in France, was compounded by a drive-through penalty for cutting a chicane, relegating him to 10th.</p> <p>Once again, however, he came back fighting. At Silverstone he silenced a crescendo of criticism and overcame intermittent showers to win a grand prix in front of his home supporters for the first time. Starting from a disappointing fourth place on the grid, he unfurled an almost flawless drive which eventually gave him a margin of more than a minute over his nearest pursuer. \"By far the best victory I've had,\" he said, explaining that at times he had needed to keeping flipping up his visor in order to clear the fogging that was obscuring his vision. And as the first half of the season came to an end, Hamilton and the two Ferrari drivers had 48 points apiece.</p> <p>The momentum was maintained in Germany, where he overcame the team's strategic error during a safety-car period to beat Massa to the flag. A puncture in Hungary dropped him to fifth and neck spasms at the dull new Valencia track prevented him from challenging Massa for first place, but a rousing win in difficult conditions at Spa was controversially converted into a third place when the stewards docked him 25 seconds for cutting a chicane late in the race, even though he had complied with the law by immediately handing back the place he had taken from Raikkonen.</p> <p>A poor choice of tyres during the wet qualifying session at Monza left him in 15th place on the grid, and a charge up to second place was spoiled by a late stop that dropped him to seventh. In Singapore an awful race under the floodlights for Ferrari - Massa setting off from the pits with the fuel hose still attached, Raikkonen hitting the wall - allowed Hamilton to pick up the points for a circumpect third place.</p> <p>The races in Japan and China, a week apart, summed up his inconsistency. At Fuji, in mayhem that recalled the heyday of the feuding Senna and Alain Prost, he overcompensated for a poor start, lost places and was hit by Massa on the second lap. Given a drive-through penalty for the incident at the first corner, he could finish only 12th. Seven days later, however, he dominated the field in Shanghai, taking pole position, the race win and the fastest lap. \"All weekend we had God on our side,\" he said after his lead had widened once again to that fateful seven points.</p> <p>The year after Mike Hawthorn's triumph, Jack Brabham got out of the cockpit and pushed his stricken Cooper the last half-mile to win the title at Sebring. Had that been asked of Lewis Hamilton yesterday, he would almost certainly have been equal to the challenge.</p>",

  "<p>Mexico's efforts to get to grips with spiralling drug crime and corruption suffered a blow at the weekend when one of the country's top police officers resigned amid allegations that drugs cartels had infiltrated his department.</p> <p>Gerardo Garay, the head of Mexico's military-style federal police force, stepped down to head off suspicion that he was working for a major drugs cartel. \"I am resigning because the bloody fight against organised crime makes it our duty to strengthen institutions, which means it is essential to eliminate any shadows of doubt regarding me,\" Garay told a press conference. \"I will put myself at the disposal of the judicial authorities.\" He denied any wrong in the federal police force, and an official statement from the chief prosecutor's office at the weekend indicated he is not under investigation.</p> <p>But the decision is the latest episode in the government's desperate battle to control the drug gangs who have been infiltrating Mexico's security forces as one prong of their strategy within an increasingly no-holds-barred organised crime war.</p> <p>Press reports have linked one of Garay's closest lieutenants to the Sinaloa cartel, which is a major protagonist in the drug wars. On Saturday the daily newspaper Reformer said the federal police had effectively \"sold\" control of the customs operations at Mexico City's international airport to the gang. So-called \"narco banners\" have also recently accused Garay of protecting Sinaloa-associated drug lords. Narco banners are propaganda messages purporting to be from different trafficking organisation that usually seek to discredit a rival gang, and are often hung from pedestrian bridges over major roads.</p> <p>Mexico's deepening drugs crisis started four years ago as a fairly straightforward, if brutal, competition between different gangs. They are fighting for control of routes for trafficking cocaine from Colombia, as well as a growing domestic users market.</p> <p>Then a military-led crackdown launched by President Felipe Calderon in December 2006 both complicated who was fighting who, and triggered a dramatic escalation of the violence. Execution-style murders have risen to close to 4,000 so far this year, including dozens of decapitations as well as a growing number of civilian victims with no obvious association with either drug trafficking or the security forces.</p> <p>Some analysts believe the cartels have also increased the amount of effort and funds dedicated to corrupting the authorities.</p> <p>This is not the first time the federal police have been under suspicion. Garay took over as acting commissioner of the force six months ago, after his predecessor was killed by a hired assassin outside his parents' home in Mexico City. The gunman not only knew the supposedly secret movements of the police chief; he also had a key to the external door.</p>",
  "<p>The number of parents registering official complaints accusing schools of breaking admission laws has rocketed this year, figures seen by the Guardian reveal. </p> <p>The schools adjudicator, Philip Hunter, has been inundated with complaints of schools breaching admission rules, most of which were either upheld or partly upheld. In the past two months, his office has settled 111 cases - more than in the whole of the previous academic year.</p> <p>The figures add to concerns that many schools have failed to fully implement the government's new code on admissions, which outlaws interviewing pupils and asking about jobs or parents' incomes in order to make the system of allocating school places more transparent. </p> <p>The fact that they include a disproportionately high number of religious schools will put pressure on the government to take action against faith schools, which control their own admission procedures. </p> <p>Hunter will today present a report ordered by the schools secretary, Ed Balls, on school admissions.</p> <p>The figures, compiled by the Guardian from the Office of the Schools Adjudicator's published case documents, suggest that the announcement by Balls in the spring that some schools had broken the rules triggered a wave of complaints from local authorities. </p> <p>Unusually, a high proportion of the complaints, which were against proposed admission arrangements for 2009, also came from parents. </p> <p>In the past two months the office has issued 111 decisions after complaints were lodged, compared with 89 in the previous academic year. About 100 were partially or fully upheld and the schools found to be in breach. More than half were faith schools, but there were also disproportionately high numbers of complaints against selective grammar schools. </p> <p>Earlier this month, Hunter revealed the initial findings of his survey in England, which found half of schools breaking admission rules, most on technicalities. But others were found to still be asking illegal questions about parental status and discriminating against children in care. He insisted most were unintentional breaches, but said that the situation was worse in faith schools.</p> <p>Council leaders called for a veto on faith schools' admission policies. Les Lawrence, who speaks for the Local Government Association on educational matters, said: \"Local authorities should be the final arbiter of and have jurisdiction over all schools' admissions policies.\"</p>",
  "<p>The chaotic opening of Heathrow's Terminal 5 was a \"national embarrassment\" caused by a catalogue of errors including a fractious relationship between British Airways and airport owner BAA, according to a report by MPs. </p> <p>The transport select committee says the debacle revealed \"serious failings\" by T5's sole tenant and its owner as the debut of a \u00a34.3bn building intended to restore Heathrow's tarnished reputation became a PR disaster. More than 23,000 bags went missing and more than 500 flights were cancelled as the baggage system collapsed despite a six-month training programme and public promises of an end to the notorious \"Heathrow hassle\".</p> <p>In its report on the botched opening published today, the committee cites errors including failure to complete the building on time, inadequate staff training and poor cooperation between BA and BAA. The committee says the debacle reinforces its view that BAA, which owns London's top three airports, should be broken up. </p> <p>\"What should have been an occasion of national pride was in fact an occasion of national embarrassment,\" said Louise Ellman, the committee chair. \"We acknowledge the inevitability of 'teething problems' but deeply regret that so many were allowed to bring the operation of Heathrow's newest terminal to a halt.\"</p> <p>BA was forced to shut its baggage check-in desks within hours of opening T5 on March 27 after baggage handlers went to the wrong loading bays, a problem exacerbated by lack of familiarity with a new handheld communication system. BA had to cancel hundreds of flights in the first week in order to clear the luggage piling up, with thousands of bags being sent to a depot in Milan for distribution to BA passengers travelling to mainland Europe.</p> <p>The airline's often troubled relationship with BAA is highlighted by the MPs, with the airport group acknowledging that they had fallen out in the run-up to the opening. The report says: \"The chaotic scenes of late March and early April could and should have been avoided through better preparation and more effective joint working\".</p> <p>Colin Matthews, BAA chief executive, admitted to MPs that the relationship with BA had \"deteriorated\" just before the building opened. Both companies now hold a daily operations meeting. </p> <p>Staff training also emerged as a key factor. BA admitted soon after the opening that some of its baggage handling teams and other staff could not find their way around the building. One former BA employee, Iggy Vaid, told the committee: \"What was missing was hands-on training as to ... where the bags would come in and so on. For baggage in particular it was still a building site.\" </p> <p>Willie Walsh, the BA chief executive, told the committee that the airline cut corners on its training programme because BAA handed over the building when parts of it were still under construction. \"My regret is that we did compromise on the testing programme.\" </p> <p>The committee also criticises the effectiveness of the pre-opening test, which saw 15,000 volunteers use the terminal, with 400,000 bags taken through the baggage system. BAA said the test bags may have been \"too uniform\" and did not put the system under sufficient stress. The report says the trials left the terminal poorly prepared for the opening.</p> <p>BAA said yesterday the terminal was now working well, due in part to closer cooperation with BA. \"Passenger satisfaction at T5 is high, and indeed consistently higher than European counterparts.\"</p> <p>BA said its baggage performance was \"significantly better\", and more than nine out of 10 flights departed on time.</p>",
  "<h2>Danit Brown</h2> <p>The day after the election, I saw <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> standing in the produce aisle of my local grocery store, wearing an \"I voted\" sticker and holding a cantaloupe. Outside, his wife waited in a station-wagon pointed north. \"What's he doing in Michigan?\" my husband wanted to know. \"Where are his bodyguards?\" Already, someone had driven through our town and taken down all the signs promising change, requisitioning them for fuel for a bonfire so large that the planes taking off and landing at the airport two towns over were going to be able see it. Even now, we could catch faint whiffs of burning posterboard whenever the A/C kicked on. \"Change, my ass,\" said the cashier who rang up our bottled water, first-aid kit and the masking tape we were going to use to keep our windows from shattering. \"I hear they're closing the border to Canada.\" In the produce aisle, Obama set down the cantaloupe and picked up a tomato. We all pretended not to see. I imagined walking up to him, taking his hand, saying, \"Come to my house. Stay with me. We have cable and a foldout sofa, and a gun for protection.\" I imagined his fingers, warm and dry, in mine. I liked him. He was handsome: tall, thin, a father of girls. In the voting booth, the day before, I'd pictured White House interns flashing their thongs, the leaders of nations peeling grapes and swooning, the Oval Office a den of love. How could they help it? I was miles and miles away from Washington, my finger poised over the lever, and on the other side of the privacy curtain, my husband - short and white and blotchy - was coughing politely: I'd already taken too long. Behind us, the line of voters stretched out the door, across the parking lot. I thought I was the only one, but later, on the news, they'd reported I wasn't, that thousands of us had turned in blank ballots, unable, finally, to cast a vote for a world whose rules we didn't know. \"Who does that?\" my husband had muttered, his nostrils flaring the way they do when he lies. \"Beats me,\" I said. \"Beats me.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Danit Brown is the author of Ask For A Convertible, a collection of short stories. </p> <h2>Hari Kunzru</h2> <p>Here in New York, we're still reeling.

Grumpy Grampy and Caribou Barbie didn't win through, at least not here. But the real undercurrent of hysteria wasn't the thwarted assassination attempt by that splinter group from the Michigan Militia, but the unwelcome knowledge that we've entered the Post-Boom. America's world dominance is over. There'll be no new buildings in NYC for at least 10 years. Brooklyn thirtysomethings are resigning themselves to being in debt for ever. Upper East Side pre-schools are offering Chinese as standard.

Yes, once the yuppies retreat there shall be punk poetry and DIY experimental sound-art for all. One vast pop-cultural reenactment - every nuance of No-Wave studied and recreated. We're only a month in, and Obama's decision to raise tariffs to \"save the economy\" hasn't really hit home. There's no money for social programs (we gave it all to bail out Goldman Sachs, remember?) so we can kiss goodbye to free healthcare, or indeed any social protection for the poor. It's dog-eat-dog time, and the big dogs have the best lobbyists.

Certainly I couldn't. </p> <p>After all, who would have guessed that the worst accusations lobbied against John McCain by Barack Obama's most fervent supporters, and against Barack Obama by John McCain's, would turn out to be true? That Barack Obama was indeed a covert Muslim terrorist - and also, simultaneously, a radical black Christian - whose true agenda was to disenfranchise white Americans, institute a broad-based socialist agenda of government hand-outs and immense taxation, then hand the whole nation over to the terrorists and retire to an island in the Caribbean? That John McCain was in fact a doddering old fool - and also, simultaneously, a vicious ultra-conservative mastermind - whose actual goal was to deprive middle-class Americans of healthcare, job opportunities and all their hard-earned social freedoms before dying a year into office and allowing Sarah Palin to assume the mantle of power, appointing Dick Cheney her vice-president and puppet-master? And that it would all come to light on the afternoon before election day, in a fashion so conspicuous and indisputable?</p> <p>It was a dispiriting turn of events, to say the least. </p> <p>Of course, most Americans, horrified by the choice with which they suddenly had been presented - a terrorist on one ticket and a dictator on the other - and unable to fathom voting for the Libertarians or (God forbid) the Greens, chose to stay home, away from the polls on November 4. But as for the rest of us, and I number myself among them, what were we to do? In the privacy of the voting booth, how were we to make our decision? </p> <p>I'm sure you'll recall the chaos of election night, as poll workers across the nation counted by hand the tens of millions of write-in candidates whose names marked our ballots.

We had, my wife and I, stayed up too late, watching returns and taking in all the commentary, even though we vowed before turning on the television, no commentary tonight, we're just going to tune in periodically, then we'll do something else, read or maybe watch a movie. We were interested in the results, in the actual numbers, but during the months leading up to the election, we consumed our fill of comment and interpretation and what passes for analysis and then declared moratoriums on the sorry lot - The News Hour, Election Center, Ballot Bowl, the best political team on television, if they did say so themselves. We twisted the coverage shut like a tap. What need did we have for additional information? We were not, after all, undecided. Our pronouncements, however, lacked teeth, and will power. So there we were, on the sofa, facing the commentators, listening, weighing, smirking. Wolf Blitzer advised that the only way to watch was with a laptop at one's side. Someone else said something about narrative, about message, about running a highly disciplined campaign. That is so true, I said. Hadley looked over at me, narrowing her eyes and nodding.

It was a name I imagined he liked the sound of. I said the name once more, elongating the syllables this time, enunciating. He, too, had seen some of the coverage, looking up from his blanket as the candidates delivered snippets of speeches. I had explained it to him, who was who and what they were about. I laid it all out, not in baby talk but in complete sentences spoken sweetly and with a little silliness. I try to talk to Elliot in sentences, I guess, so he hears whole thoughts.

  "<p>\"K\" first knew something had changed when the hole in the wall refused to let him withdraw money from his account. \"A\", meanwhile, received a 16-page letter from the Treasury. \"I couldn't make head or tail of it,\" he says, \"but the words that stood out were 'terrorist', 'al-Qaida' and 'United Nations sanctions'. To me these are words you only hear in the news.\"</p> <p>The men, who cannot be named, were informed by the Treasury that they were suspected east London-based al-Qaida facilitators, involved in funding terrorists in the tribal areas of Pakistan. The men deny the allegations, but despite being described by the court of appeal last week as \"of good character and well-respected in their community\", they have no way of challenging the measures against them.</p> <p>The Treasury is acting under little-known laws that enable the government to suspend or \"freeze\" the funds of suspected terrorists. The powers, upheld last week by the court of appeal despite being described at an earlier court hearing as \"oppressive\" and \"draconian\", render suspects criminally liable for activities as mundane as spending the change in their pockets. </p> <p>They have never been scrutinised or discussed by parliament. They were introduced by a mechanism called \"orders in council\" which enables the government to enact law based on resolutions of the UN security council. </p> <p>The result is a system of financial sanctions for anyone \"designated\" on either the UN's or the UK government's list. It need only be suspected that they \"may be\" linked to terrorist activity, a test described by the court of appeal last week as too wide. \"The risk of wholly innocent people falling within this category is a very high one,\" says Henry Miller, of Birnberg Peirce solicitors, who represents a number of people challenging orders. </p> <p>Although the court of appeal last week upheld the Treasury's use of the powers, it said it \"shared some of the concerns\". Lord Justice Sedley also criticised the measures for \"criminalis[ing] a wide range of everyday acts\". The men say this is the most troubling aspect. \"I had to phone my solicitor and ask if my son was allowed to buy me milk from the shop,\" says A. \"The answer was no.\"</p> <p>Both men eventually had their welfare benefit payments restored, although initially only their wives were allowed to spend the money and they had to provide a receipt accounting for every penny.</p> <p>\"We are talking about benefit money,\" says K. \"No one in the household can work because their income would count as the transfer of funds which could be used for my benefit. But how can someone support terrorist organisations when they are on benefits with five kids to feed?\"</p> <p>\"I have asked the Treasury how many pairs of shoes a designated person is permitted to purchase,\" Miller says. \"In response I was informed I had raised 'complex issues exploring the fringes of what constitutes a basic expense' and that they would have to consult with a minister to answer my question. It sounds amusing, but if you spend too much money or buy one item too many you could be committing a criminal offence, punishable by up to seven years' imprisonment.\"</p> <p>There is no way of finding out how those subject to financial sanctions ended up on the list of suspects. Of 300 people listed worldwide, only 10 have ever been able to free themselves, one of them by dying.</p> <p>The Treasury defends the sanctions, saying they amount to \"robust counter-terrorist finance measures\" which \"help to save lives and hold terrorists to account for their actions\".</p>",
  "<p>Police are investigating whether a man who was fatally stabbed shortly after finishing a prison sentence for killing two friends in a car crash was the victim of a revenge attack, it was reported yesterday.</p> <p>The man, named locally as Dwayne Ayres, was attacked early yesterday after a gang burst into a house in Hook, Hampshire. Friends drove him to Frimley Park hospital, Surrey, where he died of his wounds.</p> <p>Local residents said Ayres had been jailed for two and a half years in October 2007 for causing death by dangerous driving. He had been at the wheel of his Peugeot 206 when it crashed into a tree, killing his friends Callum Forbes, 15, and John Bryant, 18. Two other passengers, aged 15 and 19, were seriously injured.</p> <p>Ayres was charged with causing the deaths of Forbes and Bryant and jailed by Winchester crown court.</p> <p>The court heard that he had taken cocaine before getting behind the wheel and had been driving at 66mph in a 40mph zone when he lost control of the car.</p> <p>Neighbours said they believed he might have been killed for causing the deaths of his friends. One man, who asked not to be named, said: \"About two weeks ago there was another incident at the same house when the door was kicked in.</p> <p>\"It sounds as if someone was looking for Dwayne to settle a score - possibly over the deaths of the two boys.</p> <p>\"He had only just come out of prison after serving his sentence for causing death by dangerous driving and now this has happened.\"</p> <p>Another neighbour said Ayres was believed to have been staying at the house in Hook, although he lived in Church Crookham, near Fleet. \"I don't know whether he was staying there in the hope no one would find him after coming out of prison but it seems likely. I have been told that this gang just arrived in the street in the early hours, stormed into the house and stabbed Dwayne to death.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for Hampshire police said six men had been arrested on suspicion of murder and another three people had been detained on suspicion of aggravated burglary.</p>",
  "<p>\"Three scientists have vanished. Two bloggers are under siege. One man has an urgent message to deliver. None of them are safe.\"</p> <p>I can see what they're doing there, certainly. Kirill is a series for the internet, so bring in some internet people to make it relevant to the medium! Brilliant.</p> <p>Sadly, though, while MSN was spending six months creating the series, blogging went and died. Well, <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/entertainment/theweb/magazine/16-11/st_essay\">that's what Wired claimed</a> last week anyway, so it must be true. So surely the question is more: \"Two bloggers are under siege in a forest with no one around to see, hear or read them: does anyone care?\"</p> <p>Still, perhaps with this series, MSN can single-handedly bring blogging back to life. If bloggers' lives are this full of derring-do, how can anyone not want to join their ranks? Although it does seem to be a bit dangerous.</p> <p>So is trying to watch Kirill. With a name like that, searching through Google is likely to find you lots of information on microscopic sea life with only a minor mis-typing, and once you actually get there, MSN forces you to download a whole new player in order to get any further. </p> <p>Still, it's possibly very much worth it. The first episode is more audaciously written than any other web-series I've seen: tense, slow, giving very little away and unafraid to lead the audience slowly and atmospherically into the story, even though there's only a very short time to hook them and keep their attention. </p> <p>I'm hooked, though I don't know for how long, and if the drama becomes any more of an aggressive sales pitch for MSN platforms (\"Pro-fess-orrrrr, we've managed to locate the victim through his MSN Spaces Blog, and we'll be contacting him on MSN Messenger\") then I'm out; but if you can get through the annoyance of the medium, the use of the form actually appears to be fresh and dramatically pretty intense.</p> <p>The first third of the opener consists solely of someone counting slowly to 100 at a plodding pace, as the camera pans around numbers crossed off on a wall. And then it pans further around a dirty room, and shows a dirty man sitting looking terrified. Next you hear the words \"Coming, ready or not\" when the counting reaches 100 - and the refrain of a children's game has rarely sounded so scary.</p> <p>As the voice promises to seek whoever's hiding, suddenly the man sleeping against the number-laden wall wakes up and shoots a hole in a nearby pipe. Is he one of these bloggers we've heard so much about? I can't wait to read that post: \"Plumbing still seems on the blink, can't believe we employed top local guy Joe to put this system in. I'm never trusting him again. Still, fixed it with the dried-bloody bandage from my hand, and then got on with the day. Cheese sandwich for lunch, maybe?\"</p> <p>Next we see the man in the horrible room crossing something off a To Do list. If only our lives were exciting enough to include list items such as \"Sleep with gun in hand\", \"Don't let the outside in\" and \"Drink - Eat\" (these bloggers, they have to document everything, don't they?). </p> <p>And a computer beeps; MATCH FOUND, it says, in the kind of big green flashing letters it would be handy if computers actually used. \"Gotcha,\" says the main character, the only thing he's said in the entire episode. You see? Audacious. I'm prepared to stick with it, even though the stupid player is currently threatening to blow up my poor little computer; the quality of the content seems, in this case, to far surpass the technology given to it. And making good television is what this is meant to be about, no?</p>",

Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What are you wearing today?</strong><br>A Missoni skirt as an underskirt, a Vivienne Westwood dress, Beyond Skin vegan shoes, and my jacket is from Max &amp; Co. I've had the dress for about eight years. I bought it from Harvey Nichols. In fact, it's all from there apart from the shoes and my bag, which is an Izzy Lane prototype. It's all very well worn. If you invest in nice pieces they never really go out of fashion.</p> <p><strong>Is this an everyday look for you?</strong><br>Yes, when I am in London, but I left about four years ago to live in Richmond on the edge of the Yorkshire dales for work. There people dress for the weather and nobody is concerned with what anyone else is wearing. Fashion doesn't really exist there, but I still have it running through my veins after 20 years of living in London.</p> <p><strong>Bare legs at this time of year is brave.</strong><br>Yes. I can't bear wearing tights because they always slip down and I feel claustrophobic and uncomfortable. </p> <p><strong>How much of your wardrobe is ethical?</strong><br>I've never gone down the road of disposable fashion so, in a sense, most of it is ethical because I buy pieces I really love that I'll keep pulling out of the wardrobe for years and years. I think the cheap, disposable thing is on its way out now because it doesn't make any sense.</p> <p><strong>How would you describe your style?</strong><br>That's so difficult. I find it a real chore going through the process of deciding what to wear every morning because I have to think about what meetings I have, but I'll also have to take the dog for a walk in horizontal driving rain, then drop by and see my flock of sheep. I have such completely varied days. </p> <p><strong>Has your style changed much over the years?</strong><br>I've always had a lack of manicured-ness, so I suppose the essence of my look is the same now (I'm 47). I used to be in an indie band called Edith Strategy in the early 90s and I went through a punky phase and I think I do have that running through me still. My hair is always unkempt and I'm not highly preened. I couldn't bear living like that, even though I love beautiful clothes. </p> <p><strong>How do you stay in shape?</strong><br>Anxiety, I think. Working very hard, rushing around and a vegetarian diet. </p> <p><strong>How much time and energy do you spend shopping?</strong><br>It's difficult in Yorkshire, so I usually do my shopping when I come to London, though sometimes I find the choice overwhelming. People used to just have their work clothes and then their Sunday best. I'm sort of halfway between that on the one hand and really loving clothes on the other. It's about not over-consuming, and buying pieces that will last. </p> <p><strong>What do you wear when you have to dress up?</strong><br>I had to go to an awards night recently and I wore a blue Ben de Lisi dress that I have had for about eight years. It sounds as if I spent a lot of money eight years ago!</p> <p><strong>What is the most expensive thing you have ever bought?</strong><br>A few years ago I bought an Alberta Ferretti jacket that I never even wore. I spent about \u00a31,700. It didn't suit me. Every few months after work I used to drive up to Harvey Nichols and have a really expensive binge. I think with shopping you are either not in the mood and nothing suits you, or everything suits you and you want everything, so you have a feast.</p> <p><strong>Are you happy with the way you look?</strong><br>I am actually, and I don't mind ageing. I am in control of how I look, therefore I am happy, but it doesn't consume me at all. I have so much satisfaction from other things in my life that I don't need to be preoccupied by what I look like, and I hope that will always be the case.</p>",
  "<p>At least England's team unity will have been maintained. The prospect of large sums of money dished out unequally through the squad had threatened to undermine the corporate spirit. Peter Moores, the coach, can have no qualms on that score now: they all arrived with nothing and, after the roasting they received at the Stanford Cricket Ground on Saturday evening, that is precisely what they will have divvied up when they leave here tomorrow for India.</p> <p>The England XI got what they deserved. In simple cricket terms they were not even second-rate, offering an insipid, technically inept, strategically bankrupt and mentally flabby performance when the situation demanded excellence. They were outbowled, outbatted and outfielded by an excellent unit who, focusing on a single event, had cast off some mediocre cricket at the start of the week to produce a scintillating all-round team performance. Kevin Pietersen's men appeared novices by comparison. If they had hoped to use this match as a showcase for their credentials to join the Indian Premier League such hopes will have been dashed: Lalit Modi will not be sending out many invitations now.</p> <p>There have been indications all week that the England squad might not rise to this occasion. Too many gripes and moans - the sort that emanate from those taking a loftier view of themselves than they can justify - have emerged not to have provided a distraction. The hotel was unsuitable (for what?); Sir Allen Stanford had offended them through a bit of harmless byplay with their partners; the host also came blundering unannounced into their dressing room, a sacrosanct place; the pitch was wrong; the lights too low and glary; the outfield like Pietersen's former haircut rather than his current one. In the end they protested too much, garnering cooperation from Stanford but little sympathy.</p> <p>Better that they had concentrated on the job in hand, with more attention to the way they might play the game. As a humbling debriefing exercise, they might view footage of their own batting efforts against superlative bowling perfectly adapted to the conditions, where pace bowlers opted for a very full length or, from a normal length, took the pace from the ball so that timing was difficult. Spin was bowled to a tight line at the right pace. The England XI countered this miserably and were architects of their own downfall as much as victims of the bowling. Whoever encouraged Matt Prior and Pietersen to attempt the kind of play they did - throwing themselves to the off side, trying to play to fine leg and losing their leg stumps - should be ashamed. Twenty20 cricket promotes unorthodoxy and thinking on the hoof, but not at the expense of the basics when it matters most.</p> <p>Throughout all this Chris Gayle, the Superstars' captain, maintained total control. He managed his bowling changes with assurance, having no need to call on some of his resources, including himself and the spinner Dave Mohammed, and was able to draw on scintillating, athletic, quicksilver fielding. Perhaps above all was the element of discipline that had been instilled into his team, something which has rarely been a feature of recent West Indies efforts. If that can be maintained, and the elder statesmen in the side can convey to these new stars that an important opportunity is there for them to expand their horizons into other areas of the game, Stanford may just be right in believing that, whatever else his motives, he has helped kick-start a resurgence in the cricketing fortunes of the region.</p> <p>England are due back here to renew this contest a year from now and they would do well to consider next time how exactly they will approach it. For a start they should forget any semblance of representing \"England\". There is no contractual obligation to appear or name themselves as such, and although Stanford would prefer \"England\" to appear in the team's title, strictly as a hook for his attempts to capture the American television market (Saturday's game was shown live on ESPN2, with a potential reach of 90 million), there is room for some creativity. In so doing, they should embrace the Stanford concept as a one-off exhibition match, which is all it ever pretended to be. If this means allowing cameras into the dressing room and the odd bit of back...#8209;slapping from Stanford, then what of it? In no way did such accommodation impede the progress of his Superstars.</p> <p>The England players have been taught a huge lesson in Antigua: that pride comes before a fall. When the tournament was announced in a tacky but memorably high-profile manner at Lord's, the cash seemed to be in the accounts and being spent. Small things such as choice of tense, done unthinkingly perhaps, make the difference to perception. \"How will I spend the money?\" rather than \"How would I?\". England got ahead of themselves. </p> <p>For those watching in Antigua there was the overwhelming feeling that the right team not only won but won for the right reasons. Graeme Swann will not get his pink Ferrari after all, but he does OK. But for Andre Fletcher, for example, the young wicketkeeper-batsman from Grenada, this result will be genuinely life-changing and for the better. The Superstars worked hard over a long period and they have reaped the reward. </p> <p>So too, thanks to England's involvement, will countless schools across the region, who will benefit from the Chance to Shine campaign to reintroduce cricket to the curriculum. This has not just been an exercise in self-aggrandisement, publicity and the pursuit of riches. And, by the way, it made for a marvellous spectacle.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-339263795\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Barack Obama entered the final hours of the longest and most expensive election campaign in American history in an upbeat mood yesterday, voicing confidence that the Democrats have a \"righteous wind at our back\".</p> <p>Obama's campaign team predicted that he would break the pattern of US politics to take long-established Republican states. The RealClearPolitics average put him on 50% to John McCain's 43%, a lead that, if replicated in tomorrow's election, would produce a landslide victory.</p> <p>The McCain camp came out in force too to argue that the Republican was still in contention and that it would be a mistake to write him off. \"What we are in for is a slam-bang finish,\" McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, predicted.</p> <p>Nearly two years after it began, the closing hours of the epic battle for the White House saw both camps making an exhaustive effort to win over the diminishing camp of undecided voters and get the faithful to the polls.</p> <p>In a swing through Ohio yesterday, Obama returned to the promise of a new kind of politics that has defined his campaign. \"It won't be easy, it won't be quick, but you and I know it's time to come together and change this country,\" he told a rally in Columbus. \"We can't let this slip away.\"</p> <p>McCain, meanwhile, pleaded with voters to ignore polls showing Obama ahead. \"My friends, I've been in a lot of campaigns, I know when momentum is there,\" he told a crowd in Wallingford, Pennsylvania. \"We're going to win. I sense it and I feel it and I know it.\"</p> <p>After defeat in the 2000 and 2004 elections, the Democrats, buoyed by poll numbers, were increasingly prepared to abandon the nervous hesitation about voicing in public their hopes that they were finally on the verge of victory. The Democratic senator Chuck Schumer told CBS television: \"Wednesday morning, Dems are going to be very happy.\"</p> <p>David Axelrod, Obama's chief strategist, was also optimistic, telling CBS he was cheered by the surge in early voting which favoured Democrats. \"The edge is pretty substantial in our favour,\" he said.</p> <p>By Saturday night, some 27 million Americans had already cast their ballots, making it increasingly difficult for McCain to catch up tomorrow.</p> <p>In Colorado, a once-Republican state where Obama now leads, 46% of the electorate turned out for early voting. North Carolina, an even more strongly Republican state, also showed heavy early voting in favour of the Democrat. In south Florida, which is heavily Democratic, the waiting time for early voting was as long as six hours.</p> <p>\"We feel good,\" Axelrod said. \"It is not just the polls. It is the early voting ... These figures are coming in strong for us, reversing the traditional patterns.\"</p> <p>The Republicans, while admitting the odds were stacked against them, insisted that McCain could close the gap. \"John's a closer. He always has been,\" Fred Thompson, the Law and Order star and a former rival for the White House, told NBC. \"He often is given up for dead - literally and politically. People have been wrong about him before.\"</p> <p>A poll yesterday by the Pew Research Centre did show some slippage in Obama's lead over McCain, but the Democrat was still ahead by 49% to 42%. None of the more than 250 polls conducted since September 25 has put McCain in the lead.</p> <p>The frantic closing hours saw Republicans in Pennsylvania breaking a promise by McCain not to make an issue of race, with an ad using clips from a now infamous sermon of Obama's former pastor, the Rev Jeremiah Wright, in which he thunders: \"God damn America!\"</p> <p>McCain has \"a very steep hill to climb\", Karl Rove, the mastermind of George Bush's election victories, told Fox.</p> <p>Republicans also paid for robocalls - taped telephone messages - quoting Hillary Clinton from when she stood against Obama for the Democratic nomination, saying he was inexperienced and the White House was no place for \"on the job training\".</p> <p>McCain's team, which has been outspent in advertising by Obama almost every day since the campaign formally began early in September, said in an email to supporters yesterday that it would match him on the eve of election. \"In the final days of the campaign, our television presence will be bigger and broader than the Obama campaign's presence.\" The McCain camp said it would outspend Obama by $10m (\u00a36m) in the coming hours.</p> <p>McCain devoted most of his final hours trying to shore up support in Republican states. Aside from yesterday's stop in Pennsylvania, his itinerary called for trips to Florida, Ohio, Missouri, and even Tennessee, with a swing through the Rocky mountain states of Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico before returning to his home in Arizona tonight.</p> <p>Obama, who was in Ohio yesterday with Bruce Springsteen, will campaign exclusively in Republican territory today.</p>",
  "<p>Some referees are anchors. Unseen, they stop a game getting away from them. Mike Jones, in his third Premier League match, did not. Two decisions shaped the game, evenly as it happened, and he incurred the disfavour of everyone on and off the field. Afterwards he was the talking point of an afternoon that had better things in it.</p> <p>Before he showed the colour of his cards Jones had asserted his letter-of-the-law approach by reversing a throw-in taken at the wrong spot. From another into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/westbrom\">West Bromwich's</a> penalty area Jason Roberts shielded the ball, Ryan Donk held a chunk of his shirt and the referee, perfectly placed, awarded a penalty. Tony Mowbray was \"bewildered\", Paul Ince \"a bit surprised\". Benni McCarthy converted. </p> <p>Twenty minutes later he was gone, sent off. Donk buffeted and backed off and McCarthy, already booked, used his arm to control a ball that was suddenly too high. The red followed the second yellow, the game was adrift, the genie out of the bottle, the managers joined in indignation.</p> <p>\"It was never a sending-off in a million years,\" said Mowbray. \"The tackle for the first offence, there was no malice,\" said Ince. \"He's gone for the ball [and got Jonathan Greening half a second after its departure]. The second one the ball's got the top of his shoulder. Give red cards for dangerous tackles where the studs are up but it's not a game for women. Benni was sent off for two nothing incidents. Referees have got to be stronger than that.\" \"It was diabolical, a stupid mistake by the referee,\" said McCarthy. Despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blackburn\">Rovers </a>topping the fouls table Ince had called for more aggression.</p> <p>Both managers, as new to the Premier League as Jones, were diplomatically challenged. Of the earlier penalty incident Ince added: \"Nine times out of 10 people let it go. It was a bit harsh.\" \"In the real world refs do not give decisions like that,\" said Mowbray, who would have none of \"this PC stuff about 'Ooh, he's tugged his shirt'. If you want 7-7 games, that is what you are going to get.\" </p> <p>He is right. At every set piece into the area such fouls are simultaneously six of one and half a dozen of the other. The same goes for many a tussle. Good cheats get away with it. Bad ones feel aggrieved when caught. It was the second time in five days Donk had put his side one down by conceding a penalty in the first quarter-hour. If he needs to be more streetwise, it may be because Dutch roads are flat, England's riddled with humps and potholes.</p> <p>Albion had started scrappily but the penalty decision blew the carelessness out of their game and they raised a storm after half-time. Ishmael Miller hit a post, Ryan Nelsen banged his clearance against bar and post, Paul Robinson blocked a bullet from Robert Koren and finally Roman Bednar showed Miller how it should be done in a virtual reprise of the earlier situation - all in 90 unbroken seconds. Borja Valero, the coolest head on show, sweetly nudged the ball through for Miller to feed his strike partner. Miller soon trumped it, swaying Nelsen off his back and firing an arrow from 25 yards into the far corner.</p> <p>Albion should have gone on. They did well through the middle, better than from the wings, but fell back against 10 men and paid for it in their own shaky middle as Keith Andrews stole a late equaliser. To Mowbray it felt \"like a defeat\", to Roberts \"like a win\". The crowd, like the managers, were bonded.

Like an exhausted new father with a screaming baby, Gianfranco Zola has quickly discovered that, having looked forward to the moment he was given control of a Premier League side, the reality, while rewarding, has proven far more wearing than he imagined. </p> <p>A 1-1 draw at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/middlesbrough\">Middlesbrough</a> brought relief in that it ended <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/westhamunited\">West Ham United's</a> run of four successive defeats, but there was still enough frustration and concern to ensure another draining afternoon for their rookie Italian manager. Having dominated the first half and taken the lead through Hayden Mullins, the visitors were outplayed in the second and were clinging on for a point after the substitute Mido had scored Boro's equaliser with a low free-kick that went through a gap in the defensive wall. </p> <p>Yet the Hammers still almost snatched their first win for more than a month when in stoppage time Middlesbrough's goalkeeper, Ross Turnbull, pulled off a wonderful double save to deny Lee Bowyer and Jack Collison. </p> <p>No wonder Zola said he was tired as he reflected on a game that would have yielded three points had his team made the most of their chances before the break. \"I have been in the job for a couple of months now and it has been tough,\" said Zola, who has already been made the favourite by some bookmakers to be the next Premier League manager to lose his job after a poor start at Upton Park. \"Sometimes I think it feels more tiring to be on the bench than it is on the pitch. You are learning things all the time, picking things up and it is getting better and better in many, many aspects of the job. </p> <p>\"Is it harder than I thought? Well, it is hard, but at the same time I'm enjoying it. When I was player I thought it looked so easy. Absolutely. I can assure you I thought it was much easier than this.\" </p> <p>Boro's manager, Gareth Southgate, will concur with that view. His side were supposedly full of confidence after a 2-0 win over Manchester City but were abject for spells and failed to produce a single attacking move of note in the first 45 minutes. They did improve after Southgate's half-time chat and the introduction of Julio Arca for the anonymous Didier Digard provided the impetus they needed in midfield to push West Ham backwards. </p> <p>They gradually built up pressure and should have been level four minutes before Mido struck, but Justin Hoyte's diving header was incorrectly ruled out for offside. Yet they still needed Turnbull's late heroics to take their share of the points. Southgate described the save as \"phenomenal\" and tipped the 23-year-old academy graduate for international recognition. \"Ross has been excellent, he just needs to keep doing what he is doing and that [England] will take care of itself.\"</p> <p><strong>Man of the match </strong>Ross Turnbull (Middlesbrough)</p>",
  "<p>Whether it proves to be no more than a stay of execution remains to be seen, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/boltonwanderers\">Bolton Wanderers</a> showed sufficient spirit yesterday to suggest that Gary Megson will be their manager for a few games yet.</p> <p>In a match of little coherence but growing intensity, in the second half at least, Megson's side created a goal of a quality out of keeping with much of what had gone before but it reflected the manner in which they had outfought their expensively assembled opponents.</p> <p>Given that Bolton had failed to score in their previous three games, the late withdrawal of the \u00a38m centre-forward Johan Elmander did not bode well for their chances of putting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity\">City</a> under pressure, but it did enable Megson to bring back the previously suspended Gavin McCann as part of a five-man midfield, with Kevin Davies sent to plough an essentially solitary furrow up front.</p> <p>That being so, it was no great surprise that City were the first to offer a threat, though Jussi Jaaskelainen, making his 400th league appearance in goal for Bolton, barely reacted when an early drive from Robinho drifted a few inches over the bar. </p> <p>Jaaskelainen's self-confidence seemed almost infectious so far as his team-mates were concerned. Kevin Nolan and Mustapha Riga were industrious in making themselves available in support of Davies, and with McCann and Fabrice Muamba a dominating presence in midfield the home side began to take control.</p> <p>However, Bolton still showed few signs of being able to create a clear-cut chance. A free-kick from Matthew Taylor, driven in low, might have rebounded anywhere, and Riga sliced a long-range effort hopelessly wide.</p> <p>The game became increasingly shapeless and, although this suited Bolton more than City, there was always the chance the visitors would conjure a moment of inspiration. They nearly did so shortly before half-time. First Stephen Ireland, slipped clear into the right-hand side of the penalty area by a nicely weighted pass from Ched Evans, failed to beat Jaaskelainen as the goalkeeper came out to narrow the angle. Then Evans himself, from a similar position, saw his drive beaten away by the Finnish goalkeeper. </p> <p>City were buoyed and began the second half more brightly. Shaun Wright-Phillips, cutting in from the right, fired a left-foot shot over the bar, and soon afterwards Robinho, superbly found by Evans, forced Jaaskelainen to beat away his shot from a narrow angle. Then, shortly after the hour, Nolan spurned Bolton's best chance when a neat pass by Ricardo Gardner left him with only Joe Hart to beat. Taking the lead from his opposite number, the young goalkeeper did not commit himself too soon, standing up to make the save. </p> <p>With the game becoming stretched, Bolton's long drought finally broke. Muamba's stumbling pass to Nolan might have had an element of good fortune about it but it enabled the midfielder to play a superb first-time ball into the path of Gretar Steinsson, breaking down the right wing. The Icelander's low, curling cross, played invitingly along the six-yard line, was joyfully turned in by Gardner for his first goal since 2002. </p> <p>With three minutes remaining Bolton made the points safe. Jlloyd Samuel delayed his pass sufficiently to put Gardner in the clear down the left, and another low, firm cross was turned into his own net by Richard Dunne, with Davies in attendance. </p> <p>\"One of the senior lads had said we needed a lucky goal but we weren't lucky tonight, we played really well,\" Megson said with some justification. The Bolton supporters, who had given him a hard time in recent matches, clearly concurred, though they must have been surprised at the lack of fight shown by City. </p> <p>Mark Hughes in his own way acknowledged as much. \"You have to look at the personnel we have,\" the City manager said. \"We have a team that is technically very good but on occasions and in certain games you need different qualities, and at the moment we haven't got the variation of players to be able to do that to any great extent. But in the end Bolton played exceptionally well and we weren't able to play the game we wanted to play.\"</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Jussi Jaaskelainen</p> <p>The Bolton goalkeeper frustrated Mark Hughes's side by producing an unflappable display on his 400th league appearance</p> <p><strong>Best moment</strong> The block from Ched Evans which ensured Bolton went into the break on terms</p>",
  "<p>Lord Cuckney, who has died aged 83, operated for nearly half a century in that shadowy area where the secret state, government and the private sector overlap. He started as a spy and moved to become the specialist corporate fixer of first call to governments of every hue. </p> <p>Mention the names Crown Agents, Westland, Maxwell, Matrix Churchill and Pergau Dam and you have a neat list of most of the main industrial scandals that British governments have had to deal with since the second world war. And in them you have a common thread: John Cuckney was either directly involved in or tangentially linked to them all.</p> <p>Yet, for a man who played such a central role in some of the stickiest industrial problems of the last half-century, he remained a man of carefully crafted obscurity. His privacy remained intact. Despite a liking for business suits of an extravagantly broad pinstripe, a mop of grey, swept-back hair and distinctively owlish eyebrows, this impressive-looking man had an unshowy, even austere public manner. His private life was a closed book, apart from the fact that he lived in Westminster and Folkestone and that his second wife, Muriel Scott Boyd, exhibited her paintings at the Chelsea Arts Club. For those who asked about his own pastimes, he reserved a few arid dismissals: \"stalking yaks\" was one of them. He also enjoyed reading about the intelligence service and claimed to have read every word written about Anthony Blunt. </p> <p>Yet, ironically, if Peter Wright had not used his 1987 book Spycatcher to identify Cuckney as the man who trained him to be a spy, it is conceivable that Cuckney's involvement in MI5, which spanned most of the 1950s, would have remained under wraps. Under wraps, that is, to all those but the people at the heart of Britain's secretive system of governance who later called so frequently on his special skills as a corporate fixer and dealmaker. Others who would have known were those who could decipher his Who's Who entry, which included the illuminating fact that between 1949 and 1957 he was attached to the War Office as \"civil assistant, General Staff\". This small detail was candid, indeed, not least because the early entries left other less dangerous details of his private life out.</p> <p>He was born in India, the son of Air Vice-Marshal EJ Cuckney and his wife Lilian. He was educated at Shrewsbury, a school later attended by Michael Heseltine, the minister he would brush up against over the Westland affair. Cuckney then studied medicine at St Andrews University where he nurtured an ambition to become a surgeon. The war intervened. After service with the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, he returned to St Andrews to read history and economics and then was recruited by the intelligence service.</p> <p>Wright described Cuckney tellingly in his book as a \"tough, no-nonsense\" officer who appeared bored with training second-rate operatives and with his sights clearly set on much broader, as it happened, commercial, horizons. He told his trainees that the business of intelligence work was often about \"transgressing propriety or the law\". The 11th commandment was \"thou shalt not get caught\".</p> <p>Subsequently he did not head immediately for the commercial limelight, finding work instead in the City as a stockbroker. First it was Standard Industrial Group, a branch of the Cowdray empire, the establishment organisation which later evolved into S Pearson. In 1961 he became a director of Lazards and in the late 60s became the first director in a century to resign from the merchant bank.</p> <p>Then he established - with Sir David Alliance, the textiles king of Coats Viyella fame - a bank dedicated to financing trade deals between Britain and the Middle East called Anglo-Eastern. Barbara Castle recruited him to her Railway Policy Review committee in the late 1960s, but it was not until the 1970s that he really branched out into industrial rescue missions. He started with the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company, then moved on to be chief executive of the Property Services Agency, the government's estate managers.</p> <p>In the mid-1970s, he was parachuted in to pull the Crown Agents out of a \u00a3236m black hole. One of his main actions was to hive off International Military Services into a separate Ministry of Defence company which he chaired for 11 years to 1985, even though his tenure at Crown Agents ended in 1978. Then he was lured briefly into trying to turn round the ailing Port of London Authority. But his prescription of closures and heavy redundancies proved too strong a medicine for the then Labour administration facing the 1979 election which brought Margaret Thatcher to power. He left the PLA having been knighted.</p> <p>The cool and sometimes brutal professionalism with which he tackled one industrial crisis after another earned him a reputation as \"the company doctor who never lost a patient\". As the 1970s neared their end, Cuckney began to take the first of a long string of directorships which propelled him into the boardrooms of some of Britain's biggest industrial firms including Brooke Bond Tea, John Brown engineering, Royal Insurance, Glaxo, the Midland Bank, Thomas Cook and the venture capital giant 3i.</p> <p>Untypically, he also dabbled in some corporate buccaneering in the late 1980s takeover boom when he headed a consortium which launched a surprise but short-lived \u00a37bn bid for GEC. This time he was quickly seen off by the wily Arnold Weinstock. Cuckney's Metsun takeover consortium dissolved as quickly as it had emerged. The episode remains a bizarre one and an aberration in Cuckney's career. But his triumphs were not cut and dried. Although his high-profile intervention in 1985 in the fortunes of Westland, Britain's last remaining helicopter manufacturer, achieved survival for the company, it precipitated a political crisis which led to Heseltine and Leon Brittan resigning from the cabinet, and, by her own admission, almost brought down Thatcher.</p> <p> In industrial terms, the solution for the company that Cuckney pursued with vigour - a tie-up with Sikorsky of the US - never yielded anything but short-term benefits for the company. Heseltine fell on his ministerial sword for a rival solution where Westland would become part of a European combine comprising all of Europe's rival helicopter-makers, including Agusta of Italy. </p> <p>The Sikorsky tie-up was achieved at great political cost and with the help of a last-ditch spree of mystery share-buying by nominee companies representing Swiss banking interests. In marketing terms, Sikorsky always had more to gain than the ailing West Country firm, for it promised the US firm an inroad into the lucrative Saudi arms market which Britain then dominated. </p> <p>Ironically, Westland's real future was decided more than a decade later when it agreed a full merger with another helicopter maker. It was Agusta. </p> <p>But, as in many of Cuckney's interventions, his job was a short-term one. He was a firefighter, a sure hand in a crisis. He enjoyed the trust of governments because he was connected and understood how to solve industrial problems. Fellow industrialists admired his skills, the head of Unilever once describing him as the \"best non-executive chairman in the country\". He enjoyed the confidence of the City because he worked to a principle of always giving shareholders information - a valuable commodity in the Square Mile.</p> <p>Armed with these credentials it was not surprising that a grateful government should seek his services again when the Robert Maxwell pensions scandal broke. He was brought in to head a trust to help track down and repay to pensioners some of the hundreds of millions stolen by Maxwell from his businesses and salted away into the tycoon's private accounts in Switzerland and Liechtenstein.</p> <p>Where Cuckney featured subsequently, it was by association with murkier dealings. He was a director of Midland Bank when it ran a secret unit set up to fund defence sales and which had known links with IMS, the arms trading business Cuckney created from the Crown Agents. The unit counted among its staff Stephen Kock, a man identified as a go-between in the Pergau Dam trade-for-aid affair which eventually saw an indignant Malaysian government suspend trade relations with Britain. Cuckney denied involvement in the Midland's defence sales unit or having ever met Kock.</p> <p>In the late 1980s, he was chairman of the TI group when it sold Matrix Churchill - the company later at the centre of the Scott inquiry into the sale of arms to Iraq from which Cuckney emerged totally unscathed - to the Iraqi-controlled group TDG. His chairmanship of 3i also coincided with the venture capital group's heavy investment in Astra, the British arms company implicated in the Iraqi supergun affair.</p> <p>He was made a Conservative peer in 1995. Muriel died in 2004, and he is survived by his third wife, Jane, whom he married in 2007.</p> <p>\u2022 John Graham Cuckney, industrialist and financier, born July 12 1925; died 30 October 2008</p>",
  "<p>An Islamist rebel administration in Somalia has had a 13-year-old girl stoned to death for adultery after the child's father reported that she was raped by three men.</p> <p>Amnesty International said al-Shabab militia, which controls the southern city of Kismayo, arranged for 50 men to stone Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow in front of about 1,000 spectators. A lorry load of stones was brought to the stadium for the killing. </p> <p>Amnesty said Duhulow struggled with her captors and had to be forcibly carried into the stadium. </p> <p>\"At one point during the stoning, Amnesty International has been told by numerous eyewitnesses that nurses were instructed to check whether Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow was still alive when buried in the ground. They removed her from the ground, declared that she was, and she was replaced in the hole where she had been buried for the stoning to continue,\" the human rights group said. It continued: \"Inside the stadium, militia members opened fire when some of the witnesses to the killing attempted to save her life, and shot dead a boy who was a bystander.\"</p> <p>Amnesty said Duhulow was originally reported by witnesses as being 23 years old, based on her appearance, but established from her father that she was a child. He told Amnesty that when they tried to report her rape to the militia, the child was accused of adultery and detained. None of the men accused was arrested. </p> <p>\"This was not justice, nor was it an execution,\" said Amnesty's Somalia campaigner, David Copeman. \"This killing is yet another human rights abuse committed by the combatants to the conflict in Somalia, and again demonstrates the importance of international action to investigate and document such abuses, through an international commission of inquiry.\"</p>",
  "<p>Failures of judgment may not happen very often at the BBC, serious ones more rarely still, but when they do they seem to arrive in volume. Worse, in the case of Sachsgate each misjudgment seemed to reinforce the very poor public impression given by the others. </p> <p>First there was the almost complete absence of anything resembling good taste or judgment by Jonathan Ross, Russell Brand and their producers in the studio, which left many licence-fee payers wondering what kind of organisation they were in effect being compelled to fund. Not \"their\" BBC as most of them imagined it, that's for certain. </p> <p>Next there was the news that senior BBC editorial executives had approved the offending material for broadcast. Having already been shocked by the antics of Ross and Brand, the licence-fee payer was then confronted with the idea that BBC managers also appeared to think this material was acceptable. For the second time in just over a year - remember Queengate? - very senior executives have either approved things without knowing what was in them or failed to understand the significance of what was in front of them. </p> <p>Then, to cap it all, there was the BBC's corporate reaction to events after the story broke, when it failed to grasp that the story was more than a bit of Mail mischief-making and didn't issue a statement apologising for the broadcast until 24 hours later. Licence-fee payers could have been forgiven for thinking that the corporation at the highest level didn't take Ross and Brand's behaviour as seriously as they did. Meanwhile, the BBC Trust appeared to be powerless onlookers as turmoil gripped the organisation of which they are supposed to be the sovereign body. </p> <p>However, Mark Thompson - away in Sicily with his family when the story broke - appears to have done enough to stabilise the BBC's position, for the moment at least. More may yet emerge from the internal investigation, the BBC Trust's deliberations and Ofcom's inquiries, but the BBC does seem to have regained a measure of control. </p> <p>But bigger questions about the BBC's internal creative and management culture, and ultimately Thompson's leadership, remain. Are the priorities right? Does key talent have too much power? Is the BBC in danger of losing its moral compass in the pursuit of younger hard-to-get audiences? Can licence-fee payers, even if they accept that presenters may from time to time misbehave, trust the BBC as a corporation to make the right calls?</p> <p>For many, where once the answer would almost certainly have been yes, there may now be some element of doubt. And for Thompson personally - who has been confronted with a series of episodes of which he apparently knew little until he had to appear in public to apologise about them - this is just starting to get serious. Yes, he has done all the right things: promising the BBC will learn lessons at the same time as weathering significant staff unhappiness generated by his less-than-hoped-for licence-fee settlement. But Thompson is starting to look unlucky and not always in command of all parts of the organisation he leads.</p> <p>Sooner or later, regime change will start being talked of as necessary to secure the future. Thompson put Ross on a final warning - but another mishap with even the slightest whiff of structural, systemic or even very senior management failure about it, would surely make Thompson's own position difficult. If not untenable.</p> <p>When it comes to public policy, Sachsgate will probably not make very much short-term difference. There are big decisions looming on the future of public service broadcasting and potentially top-slicing the licence fee to pay for other things. And although the BBC's argument - that it can be trusted to make best use of the cash and it is most obviously accountable to licence-fee payers for how it is spent - may have taken something of a knock last week, the political direction of travel is unlikely to change. </p> <p>But in the longer term the kind of damage to public perception that events such as those of last week can do is difficult to overestimate. Evidence from a Media Guardian/IpsosMori poll earlier this year suggested that while people still love the BBC's programmes, they are much less sure about the BBC corporately. Questions thrown up by telephone scandals, fakery, Queengate and now Sachsgate play straight into that agenda. When the next licence fee or royal charter has to be negotiated, the BBC's standing in the esteem of the nation will surely be a major factor. And for all its talk of connecting with audiences, in some respects the BBC seems more out of touch and inward-looking than ever. </p> <p>The last time the licence fee was negotiated, the corporation's image was suffering from a top management decision that was widely regarded as another major misjudgment. The mistake? To give a chatshow host an \u00a318m contract. The result? Gordon Brown chopped more than \u00a31bn off the licence-fee settlement painstakingly negotiated between the BBC and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. </p> <p>That time Jonathan Ross only cost the BBC cash - albeit lots of it, and not just in terms of his fee. This time the BBC will have to hope the cost of Ross is not the corporation's reputation.</p>",
  "<p>This was supposed to be the year that the BBC gradually rebuilt its reputation: 2007 was said to have been its \"annus horribilis\" and the corporation's previous PR strategy had not just succeeded in shooting itself in the foot, it had turned both barrels against its head. </p> <p>By the beginning of 2008 the BBC had widely distributed its new \"draconian\" PR manual and by March there was a new director of communications, Ed Williams, in place. Williams, who had learned his craft at Alan Parker's Brunswick agency, joined from a successful stint at Reuters and was given the scope to review and take control of the BBC's sprawling PR apparatus. </p> <p>But seven months on, Sachsgate has proved at least as serious a blow to its reputation as Queengate last year. Has the Beeb really learned so little?</p> <p>Yet again there was a failure to act quickly or decisively enough to control an escalating crisis. The comms team failed to kill, or at least control, the Mail on Sunday's original story early on. The BBC did put out a statement apologising to Andrew Sachs last Monday. But journalists following the story tell of a \"limited\" and \"half-hearted\" response from the BBC press office.</p> <p>The PR team claims it would have been wrong to have put up the director general Mark Thompson, who was on holiday, to make a major apology at the beginning of the week. He eventually appeared on Wednesday. \"It would have been an overreaction,\" insists one senior executive. Most PR experts disagree. </p> <p>As arguably the second-highest-profile institution in this country after the government, the BBC faces a uniquely complex PR challenge. Given this, even some senior executives at the corporation admit privately that the PR operation is not fit for purpose. The biggest problem is a relatively decentralised structure, with specialist divisions running their own press teams. This can prevent localised problems - a gaffe within Radio 2's output, for example - from being spotted by senior management quickly enough. One BBC manager describes it as a \"federal structure; a kind of disunited nations\".</p> <p>Another flaw is that even Williams's corporate affairs team sits within the wider marketing and audiences division that was created two years ago. Since then there has been a growth in the number of people who proactively market programmes, but a comparative decline in comms specialists who can spot, and react to, escalating crises.</p> <p>To be fair, Williams recognises the problems and should be given sufficient time to turn this super-tanker around. During his first six months he has appointed an entirely new senior comms team, including Tina Stowell, who only became head of corporate affairs in September. He is close to announcing a review of the responsibilities of what he calls his \"comms cabinet\", which he says should enable PR people to identify and deal with crises more quickly. But his team's ultimate challenge - which dovetails with that of Thompson - is to enable the BBC to drive its own agenda rather than reacting to hose of its enemies.</p> <p>Today the BBC is under almost constant pressure to justify its very existence, something that requires a strong and consistent argument to emerge from all parts of the corporation. Its comms team must start emulating the campaigning approach of a political party, or presidential candidate - which will mean a fundamental change of approach to communications. </p> <p>In short, the BBC needs to listen more; to be more open about its processes; and to be more collaborative in its decision-making. Moreover, it needs to be able to act appropriately and decisively, and to be seen to be doing so.</p> <p>Above all, it needs to do this quickly. Because - as Thompson and Williams have just discovered - even half a week can be a long time in broadcasting.</p> <p>\u2022 Danny Rogers is the editor of PR Week</p>",
  "<p>A Scottish council which pioneered locally sourced and organic school meals is to offer all its 16,500 pupils the chance to earn \"ethical\" reward points for overseas aid by eating healthy school dinners. </p> <p>From today, schoolchildren in East Ayrshire will earn points to help buy farm animals, food supplies and medical supplies and equip classrooms for projects run by development charity Save the Children. </p> <p>The project is believed to be the first of its kind in the UK, and is seen as a more \"holistic\" strategy for encouraging healthy eating than schemes that reward children with iPods, concert tickets and book tokens for eating school dinners.</p> <p>East Ayrshire is one of many councils trying to combat unhealthy eating and increase the numbers eating school meals.

  "<p>Radio 2 attracts the top radio talent, has the largest audience of any radio station in Britain, is admired by the industry and feared by commercial radio. Yet it has been plunged into the worst crisis in its 41-year history - and by Jonathan Ross, the very DJ who led the revitalisation of the station in 1990s. </p> <p>For Lesley Douglas, her departure from Radio 2 is a personal tragedy. I know her well, having worked with her when I was managing editor of Radio 1 and head of strategy for BBC Network Radio. Lesley is fantastic with talent, loves music and has a strong sense of what a popular public service station needs to sound like. While her predecessor, Jim Moir, received the credit for repositioning Radio 2 from its former incarnation as a station for the over-50s, it was Lesley as his deputy who was the power behind the throne. The decisions to put Steve Wright on weekday afternoons and Jonathan Ross in the Saturday morning slot were the key planks in the strategy to modernise Radio 2 in order to attract a younger audience. </p> <p>The crisis engulfing Radio 2 won't go away quickly. The network is leaderless and its credibility damaged. Listeners will have been disgusted by the abuse meted out to Andrew Sachs and his family and Ross's audience-pulling power must now be in question. Listeners will not empathise with someone who thinks they are above the law. Radio 2 has a dilemma - whether to keep Ross or let him go. Executives' greatest fear will be that sacking him - a decision they arguably should take - will only propel him to commercial radio, which, given its need for ratings, will quickly snap him up. Chris Tarrant, recently hired by GMG Radio [owned by the Guardian Media Group, which publishes MediaGuardian] to go head-to-head with Ross on Saturday mornings, will probably pick up some of the listening Radio 2 will shed.</p> <p>Russell Brand loses little in this debacle. He will never work for Radio 2 again, but won't care too much. For the station, a show more in keeping with a public service purpose will be relatively easy to find. Most people will still want to work for the network. Radio 2 will recover, but it needs to convince the BBC, licence-fee payers and listeners its sense of decency and editorial integrity can be repaired.</p>",
  "<p>Work-life balance? These pages, over the years, have contained many thousand words of approval. See more of your partner, more of the children; give relationships time to grow. But perhaps, at last, it's time to extend such beneficence to one small, unappreciated group in society whose working lives remain fundamentally out of balance: I mean newspaper editors, radio controllers and BBC directors general. </p> <p>For consider the curse of half-term and other holidays. Where was Mark Thompson when Ross-Brand blew up? In Sicily. Where was DG Greg Dyke when Andrew Gilligan lit the blue touchpaper on Today? Up a mountain in South America. And where, for that matter, was the new BBC Trust supremo as his first phone-in scandal ignited? Michael Lyons found himself in a slightly difficult spot: New Zealand.</p> <p>The impression, too easily given, is that the titans of British broadcasting do little but swan round the globe. But, just for once, try to see it another way. </p> <p>I ran the Guardian for 20 years and the most difficult home debates erupted at holiday time. Why can't you come when you said you'd come? Because there's a bomb/byelection shock/cabinet reshuffle. But these dilemmas grow worse when you're actually on holiday, wondering whether to rush back. Mountbatten murdered in yacht blast? Coup bid to topple Gorbachev? </p> <p>The problem for editors (and Mark Thompson, too) is that they're never really off-duty. They work inevitable, incessant long days and nights. And now they can always be summoned anywhere round the world at the push of a button. But the people who stay behind, in charge of that button, don't necessarily want to press it too fast. It diminishes them in their own eyes. It says: \"We can't handle this.\" Thus the dilemmas grow. </p> <p>The trouble with media maelstroms is how fast they develop, Hurricane Russell gathering force day by day. Thompson was phoned in Sicily when the Mail on Sunday slopped its initial bibfull; he was consulted, in sort-of charge. And yet he wasn't there in the midst of things, reading other papers, hearing the bulletins, sitting in his office as inquiries were announced and duly proceeded. He was (I'd guess) debating whether to pack and head for Palermo airport, whether to leave wife and family behind, whether to ruin something they'd all been looking forward to for ages. Again.</p> <p>The pat verdict is that the BBC has too many bureaucratic masters tripping over their own feet. But the reality (as with newspapers, frankly) is trying to decide who's really in charge: one pair of feet or a battalion? In media law, top dogs carry the can. In BBC practice, it's the DG who gets barracked or given the boot. And if it's absurd to demand his head, then very senior controllers have to reach for their swords.</p> <p>Now: before the scoffs start, I know that danger money goes with such dangers. I'm looking for understanding, not exculpation. It's unbalanced impracticality to hold a director general - or even controller - personally responsible for a thousand decisions and millions of words spoken somewhere down the line. It's increasingly ludicrous to suppose that any editor can vet every tale in print or on a website through day and night. </p> <p>Of course, other journalists may snort derisively here. But nobody blames Paxo for being on holiday. Nobody sneers when Richard Littlejohn lies prone in some Corfu deck chair. </p> <p>But editing has become a quite different game. And before the next hurricane breaks, we need to check out some more balanced rules, because the old ones are becoming blood-boltered history.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:p.preston@theguardian.com\">p.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Emotions run hot on election eve, and few emotions are more a-boil right now than liberal paranoia. I hear it constantly: I don't care about the polls. I won't believe it until I see it. The Republicans stole 2000 and 2004, and they'll steal this one.</p> <p>This dark pessimism is fortified by a corollary anxiety that each new revelation about Barack Obama will surely bring the whole enterprise crashing down and make middle Americans wake up and say to themselves, \"Of course. What was I thinking? Back to McCain!\" </p> <p>This past weekend it was the story about Obama's auntie in Boston, a woman living in the US illegally for the last four years. But Zeituni Onyango is fading into the background, just another element of the farrago of last-minute titbits that make for future trivia questions. Her name may have been unlawfully leaked to the press by officials seeking to do Obama damage. But whatever the truth of that matter, the injury to Obama would appear to be minimal.</p> <p>And yet, some liberals feared that this revelation would be the death knell. But in their terror, they have probably not stopped to ask themselves: if Bill Ayers and Jeremiah Wright and Rashid Khalidi - the Palestinian rights advocate with whom Obama is friendly and whom McCain smeared last week - didn't blow up this campaign, why would Onyango?</p> <p>Face it, liberal paranoiacs: the swift-boating of Barack Obama clearly is not working. That it would work - indeed that it would define the contest - was the greatest fear of liberals everywhere as it became clear last spring that this somewhat unusual creature would carry the Democratic standard into battle this autumn. Many foresaw an October full of racial innuendo, Obama-Osama Freudian slips and worse. </p> <p>Sure enough, we did see a lot of it. John McCain and Sarah Palin worked overtime to try to persuade Americans that Obama shared Ayers's radical world view. McCain's disgraceful comparison of Khalidi to a \"neo-Nazi\" - this about an American citizen by birth who teaches at an Ivy League university and has no record of extremism beyond that which can be conjured on rightwing websites on the basis of the odd out of context quote - was perhaps the lowest point of his whole campaign. And the Republicans have used race in subtle ways - the argument that Obama would take people's hard-earned tax dollars and hand them to idlers on \"welfare\" is a very old racist trope in the US.</p> <p>Here in the 11th hour, we are hearing that Obama is unpatriotic and a friend to criminals; that he's not really a citizen of the US (disproved over the weekend by birth registrars in the state of Hawaii); and that his election will lead to a second Holocaust.</p> <p>Yes, the voting is still a day away. But so far none of it has amounted to a single point in the polls that I can see, except perhaps in some southern states where tradition dies hard. Why? Three reasons. </p> <p>First, the Obama team has responded quickly whenever such allegations have arisen. John Kerry's advisers let a fateful 15 days of swift-boating pass before they even addressed the issue. Obama's people haven't made that mistake. They've answered all charges and usually turned around and levelled a few charges of their own.</p> <p>Second, the economic crisis really has fixed many voters' minds on more germane questions. Voters are more susceptible to character attacks when times are good and they don't have real bread-and-butter issues to worry about. But when times are tough, they actually do listen a little harder to discern which candidate seems to be more serious about addressing their problems.</p> <p>The third reason is historical and is just my theory, but I think it's right. Broadly speaking, the American electorate consists of three chunks: committed conservatives, committed liberals and the uncommitted swing voters in the middle. When Ronald Reagan realigned American politics in 1980, he did so by forging a strong emotional alliance between the right and the middle. Centrist voters gave Republicans and conservatives the benefit of the doubt and looked upon Democrats and liberals, whom Reagan successfully discredited, with deep suspicion.</p> <p>In that context, charges that Democrats weren't good Americans tended to stick. Whether it was Michael Dukakis's membership in the American Civil Liberties Union in 1988 or Kerry and the swift-boaters last time around, conservative allegations that Democrats seem alien and elitist and not fully American took hold with voters in the middle. They accepted terms of argument set by the Republicans.</p> <p>But post-George Bush we're in a new context. That coalition of affinity that Reagan created between right and middle, Bush has put asunder. His failures have made the average, apolitical American as distrustful of conservatism as he or she once was of liberalism - indeed somewhat more so, since the memory of conservative failure is fresher in the mind. This is a new context. Many experts have yet to grasp it. Certain elements within the mainstream media haven't quite got it yet. And clearly some liberals just can't believe that it might be the case.</p> <p>This is not to say that negative campaigning will disappear as of tomorrow. But it is to observe that political contexts change, and eras end. I'm still suspicious enough to use the conditional tense, but by Wednesday morning even the most paranoid liberals may be forced to accept that fact.</p> <p>\u2022 Michael Tomasky is the editor of Guardian America.

  "<p>On the lookout for \"cracks in the regime\", analysts of Iran had a thrill last month. The bazaars of Isfahan, Tehran, and several other cities went on strike for the first time in a generation. </p> <p>In the labyrinth of vaulted passages the richest traders were always the jewellers. Their glittering windows are rarely without at least one mother and daughter glued to the glass. When one pair of black chadors goes in to buy or moves away, another takes its place. The hunt for the right wedding ring is constant and business never flags.</p> <p>Except three weeks ago, when Isfahan's goldsmiths closed their doors, soon followed by jewellers elsewhere. Spice merchants and clothes stores joined in, and the heavy wooden doors of Isfahan's bazaar swung shut. </p> <p>Police swooped on the homes of suspected strike leaders but it was not just repression that ended the protest a day or two later. The government caved in, releasing the detainees and announcing that plans to introduce value added tax, the cause of the anger, would be suspended for a year. </p> <p>Outside Iran, the regime's critics excitedly recalled that the bazaaris have not struck since the months before the Shah's fall three decades ago. Traditionally anti-western, and with close ties to the clergy, they helped to produce the Islamic revolution in 1979. They still control a large chunk of Iran's wholesale trade and distribution networks. Their donations help to fund the mosques. If the bazaaris break ranks, something truly big is under way.</p> <p>So goes the wishful thinking, but it is wrong. First, what infuriated the bazaaris was not the tax (a modest 3%) but the fact that it would require them to open their books for the first time. They were resisting President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's cautious attempts at modernisation, not protesting against dictatorship. Second, the \"cracks in the regime\" theory assumes a brittle monolith. But neither my fleeting impressions from visiting seven Iranian cities nor the comments of Iranian pundits put the country anywhere close to this. On the contrary, calm and normality are what strike you. The western stereotype of a threatening and dangerous country is wide of the mark. People regularly greet foreigners with \"Welcome to Iran\", partly to practise their English but also to thank you for resisting panic and coming to see for yourself. </p> <p>Such analysts as Bijan Khajehpour, who heads a strategic consulting firm in Tehran, see Iran becoming more homogeneous over time. The divide between big cities and smaller rural towns is shrinking, he says, as young people aspire to learn English and computer skills, follow global dress and music codes, and embrace consumerism. Saeed Leylaz, the editor of Sarmayeh, a financial daily, notes an opposite tendency at least in the economy - a widening of the income gap over the last three years. Ahmadinejad's highly publicised tours to small towns and villages, and the largesse he gives for local projects, have not increased equality. Galloping inflation, which has just reached 30% annually, hits the poorest hardest. \"In the last year of Khatami [the previous president] the Gini coefficient for income inequality was 0.39. Now it's 0.43, not far below the 0.45 of the Shah's worst period,\" Leylaz says.</p> <p>The fall in oil prices and the improbability of any early upturn are plunging Iran into a financial crisis as sharp and sudden as that of western economies. This threatens living standards far more than western sanctions. Experts calculate that Iran needs a price of at least $76 a barrel, compared to the current $60, to prevent a rise in the government's budget deficit as well as a trade deficit that will require a slash in imports. Yet the likelihood that Iran's crisis will lead to a political upheaval is as remote as the chance that the wreck of western neoliberalism will produce revolution in the US and Europe.</p> <p>Iran's system is flexible and resilient. Media controls are strong but getting less so. State TV reported the bazaar strikes because most families, in the smaller towns as well as Tehran, watch foreign TV via satellite dishes installed through the black market. The government has to put its own spin on bad news rather than ignore it. </p> <p>With presidential elections next June the political factions are filling the print media, as well as parliament, with heated arguments over domestic and foreign policy. If one test of democracy is having elections in which the result is unpredictable, Iran certainly passes it. \"The key point,\" as Khajehpour puts it, \"is that we don't have a dominant political faction or agenda nowadays. They are all minorities.\" As many as six credible candidates may contest the first round before a French-style run-off.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad represents the conservatives. They prefer to call themselves \"principle-ists\" since they believe in the principles of Islam and a strong Iranian (that is, non-western) identity. But Ahmadinejad comes under frequent attack from \"radical principle-ists\" as well as other moderate conservatives like himself. Amir Mohebbian, an economic commentator for the conservative paper Resalat, criticises the president's poor choice of words before foreign audiences as well as aspects of his tax and welfare policies.</p> <p>A parliamentary showdown is looming over Ali Kordan, the interior minister, who will be impeached this week for faking his university degrees. This could trigger a vote of no confidence in Ahmadinejad's government. Some commentators say his reformist opponents may not support it. \"They don't want to make him a martyr. They think he will not be re-elected next year anyway,\" says one analyst who prefers to keep his name unpublished.</p> <p>Foreign critics may claim that in spite of boisterous faction-fighting, Iranian politics are imprisoned within a narrow spectrum of ideas and therefore count as undemocratic. But don't European and US politics also display what the French call pens\u00e9e unique? It is only when societies are already moving into instability that the political class begins to tolerate, or is forced to accept, a widening of the margins for debate. </p> <p>Iran is becoming more secular. A group of mullahs in Shiraz concede that fewer people attend mosques than a decade ago \"because more time has passed since the revolution\". Ali Reza Manaei, a guide at Tehran's martyrs' museum and a member of the Basij, a group of revolutionary volunteers, complains that the values of social solidarity are ebbing while corruption is on the rise. \"The government's behaviour has got worse, and so has people's behaviour towards one other,\" he says.</p> <p>Even Ahmadinejad is a quasi-secularist. Formed politically by the eight-year war with Iraq, \"he represents a kind of thinking that doesn't see a huge value in having the clergy in power,\" one commentator argues. Another points out that the president feels he has a direct link to the Hidden Imam (the Shia version of the returning messiah) and can dispense with the mediation of clerics. </p> <p>In short, Iran is complex. Even to Iranians it seems unfathomable. For foreign governments the message is this: don't expect regime change in the near future. Above all, don't try to force it.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:j.steele@theguardian.com\">j.steele@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>In a setting where his idol Ayrton Senna was once worshipped, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewishamilton\">Lewis Hamilton</a> yesterday achieved the ambition that has gripped him since he was a six-year-old boy playing with a radio-controlled car. At the end of two years in which he has inspired a rare combination of admiration and resentment, Hamilton brought his two-year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone\">grand prix career</a> to the first of what may be many climaxes.</p> <p>There are many ways to win the world championship, and the one selected by Hamilton was certainly among the most dramatic. For much of yesterday's race his McLaren-Mercedes had been sitting comfortably in fifth position behind the Ferrari of his greatest rival, Felipe Massa, another driver, Sebastian Vettel, whose Toro Rosso car had a Ferrari engine, his rival's team-mate, Kimi Raikkonen, and Massa's most ardent supporter - Fernando Alonso. But as long as the situation remained unchanged and he kept his hold on the fifth place which would be enough to guarantee him the title, he did not need to mount what would have been a series of risky challenges.</p> <p>It was the insertion of Timo Glock's Toyota into an unexpected fourth place, the German driver benefiting from a decision to stay out on dry tyres while the rest were diving into the pits and changing to wets for the closing laps, which provided Hamilton - suddenly relegated to sixth - with a final challenge. As Glock slid around the rainswept track on increasingly unsuitable rubber, Hamilton found a way past with only a few hundred yards to go.</p> <p>\"Before it started to rain I was quite comfortable, and I was just concentrating on having a clean race,\" he said. \"Then it started to drizzle and I didn't want to take any risks - but Sebastian got past me and I was told that I had to get back in front of him. I couldn't believe it. Then at the very last corner I managed to get in front of Timo. It was just amazing. I was shouting, 'Do I have it? Do I have it?' on the radio. It was only when I took the chequered flag and got to turn one that the team told me I was world champion.</p> <p>\"This was the most dramatic race of my whole life. It's pretty much impossible to put into words. It's been such a long journey, but I've always had the support of my family, the team, our partners and the fans. We did a fantastic job throughout the whole year and, with all the sacrifices we made, I'm so thrilled to be able to win this for everyone.</p> <p>\"It's been a fairytale story. Ron Dennis gave me my opportunity years ago. He had the foresight to bring me in, to groom me to get to this position. I've grabbed it with both hands and I've paid him back in full, so I'm happy with that. I hope this is the first of many, but I don't know if my heart can take that final lap in many more seasons. It is absolutely fantastic, an amazing achievement, but one of the most troubled days. It was such a hard race, but now I'm ecstatic and very emotional.\"</p> <p>Perhaps there was no greater tribute than the one paid by Alonso, who arrived in the McLaren garage to congratulate the man who had just taken his title as the youngest champion in formula one history. The two have been viewed as bitter enemies since they clashed while both were in the McLaren team last season. \"Well done,\" the holder of the 2005 and 2006 titles said, putting his arm around the shoulders of the newly crowned champion.</p> <p>The vanquished Massa was equally gracious in defeat. \"We need to congratulate Lewis,\" he said after winning the race - his sixth of the season, to Hamilton's five - but missing the title by a single point. \"He did a great championship. I know how to win and I know how to lose - it's part of life, part of our experience.\"</p> <p>Massa described the seconds immediately after he took the chequered flag, when he depended on his race engineer, Rob Smedley, to tell him whether or not he had won the title. \"When I crossed the line, Rob was telling me, 'Calm down, calm down, I need to check Hamilton'. Then I was going into turn one and it was taking for ever. It was, 'Wait a second, he's fighting with Glock.' Then I got to turn three and it was 'OK, he's passed Glock'.\"</p> <p>Dennis, McLaren's chairman, revealed how close the call in the closing stages had been: \"We just said to Lewis, 'OK, this is it. Just be careful. You will catch him.' It was heart-stopping stuff.\"</p> <p>Sir Stirling Moss, the best driver never to win the title, was effusive in his praise. \"It was staggering,\" he said. \"I thought the whole race was terrific and Lewis won the world title in a tremendous finish. He's a racer. He gets on with it. He's good in the wet, good in the dry.</p> <p>\"It's very difficult comparing drivers from my era, when it was really dangerous, to now, so it's not like for like. But if you're talking about a man's ability to control a car, I think he's up there [with the best] now.\"</p> <p>As he celebrated with his team, Hamilton said: \"I'd like to thank McLaren for giving me such a wonderful car and my family for being here to support me. We came, we saw and we did what we had to do.\"</p> <h2>ITV's dramatic last lap</h2> <p><strong>James Allen</strong> We're expecting Massa any time now. He comes through to claim his sixth victory of the season. He has done everything he needed to do and we wait now to find out who will be the world champion of 2008. Can Hamilton do anything? Can he run it up the inside of Vettel? Only a few corners to go now and desperation starts to creep into Lewis Hamilton. </p> <p><strong>Martin Brundle</strong> Raikkonen's third and ... (shouting) is that Glock, is that Glock? It is! That's Glock!</p> <p><strong>JA</strong> Oh my goodness me. Hamilton's back in position again. A hundred thousand local hearts sink in the grandstand. It's handed the place back to Hamilton. He comes through. And you're right, I'm sure, that he's going to claim fifth place which is all he needs to do to become ...</p> <p><strong>MB</strong> Yes! </p> <p><strong>JA</strong> ... the 2008 formula one world champion. Lewis Hamilton, and you will ... well, the Ferrari boys are celebrating, they think they have won. They're wrong. They absolutely haven't. Hamilton finished fifth. And Lewis, the father realised he celebrated too early, and Nicole Scherzinger, the girlfriend of Lewis Hamilton, hugs Aki Hintsa, his head doctor. You will never see a more dramatic conclusion to any motor race, let alone a grand prix, and the result of it all is that, in the most harum scarum way possible - he doesn't make it easy for himself, does he? - Lewis Hamilton is the world champion.</p> <p><strong>MB</strong> Unbelievable.</p>",
  "<p>A couple of years ago the physical theatre company Complicite were workshopping their new play when they decided they needed some help. Given that A Disappearing Number (currently playing at the Barbican in London) involves the early 20th-century Cambridge mathematician GH Hardy, and an Indian mathematician he tutored, Srinivasa Ramanujan, they thought they would call on the services of a real live mathematician for their games, so they rang Marcus du Sautoy, a professor of mathematics at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/oxforduniversity\">Oxford</a>, and began their pitch.</p> <p>\"'You probably don't know who we are -'\" Du Sautoy remembers them saying. \"And I said, 'Well, I do, and whenever my maths is going badly, it's you I want to run off and join.'\" In fact, he'd done workshops with them during his undergraduate days at Oxford, and has always loved the fact that Comlipicite don't try \"to replicate real life, they're not trying to create something that you could perhaps do better on film - they're celebrating the space of the theatre. And in a way that appeals to me because it's a bit like doing mathematics. Mathematics is a place where you can do things which you can't do in the real world.\" </p> <p>As is clear from his most recent book, Finding Moonshine, many brilliant mathematicians are rather like we might imagine them to be - eccentric, unworldly, obsessed with train timetables or freakishly large numbers (he tells of one who courted his wife by reciting the expansion of pi; they took it in turns to do 20 decimal places each). Du Sautoy, who plays football, the trumpet, the piano, is a cook and a curious traveller, surfs (\"I count the waves - every seventh one is good\") has a stronger claim on the so-called real world. Yet even he, as he puts it in Finding Moonshine, \"can't step over a starfish in the sea without spinning the pentacle in my head. I can't ignore the strange pattern that adorns my swimming trunks.\" He makes deals with his long-suffering son - a morning looking for symmetry in the British Museum for an afternoon in the skateboard park; a day searching for the 17 possible types of plane symmetry in the Alhambra for shopping in Granada.</p> <p>Du Sautoy, 43, was this week made Charles Simonyi Chair in the Public Understanding of Science at the University of Oxford, and in many ways the post merely formalises what - in the 2006 Royal Institution Christmas Lectures, in his previous book The Music of the Primes, on his current BBC4 show, The Story of Maths - he was doing for his subject already: his particular achievement has been that he is both of mathematics and the world, rather as Complicite are of theatre and the world - interested in making wondrous shapes we can't quite comprehend, but intent on showing them to us anyway, saying, \"Look, isn't it wonderful?\" </p> <p>Well-practised advocate that he is, he also knows that \"of all the sciences, mathematics is the real challenge. People sort of understand the other sciences - what you do, what you're studying, the things, whether it's animals or chemicals, even little particles - but I think for me the challenge is to try and overcome people's antagonism towards mathematics, to show them that mathematics is really part of all the other sciences - you can't do the other sciences without mathematics. It is the language of the sciences, and built the modern world we have today.\" His wife and twin daughters are away on half term, so he is cooking dinner for his 12-year-old son in their cosy kitchen in north London, evangelising over the potatoes. He waves green-and-yellow oven gloves at me; they match, if that's the right word, his pale pink hoodie, lime-green shirt, orange trousers, and shiny blue trainers.</p> <p>\"For me the challenge of the job is to try and communicate that - not to preach to the converted, but to reach the BBC Radio Five Live audience ...\" But shouldn't he start with children? Bored, recalcitrant teenagers? \"I think my primary audience is in some sense an adult audience, because I think that will then have a knock-on effect for children.\" Having said which, he remembers \"a frightening statistic that over half the teachers who teach maths in school don't have a maths degree. That means that they don't really understand what mathematics is about. I think that's one of the problems across the whole of society. People think it's long division to lots of decimal places - but actually, it's something much more exciting.\" </p> <p>And times tables. \"Yeah. Times tables. You know, I'm not terribly fast at my times tables, because that's not what I think mathematics is about. I think it's the same thing as thinking that a good speller will make a great writer. Well, no, actually - great writers can be crap at spelling, but have great vision and ways of bringing stories alive - and I think you've got to put over that mathematics is a similar idea.\" </p> <p>His attitude to key stage 3 - 11- to 14-year-olds, measurably the group most likely to be lost to maths, because they get bored - is to lure them in with familiarity (he has a favourite presentation about why David Beckham chose the number 23 shirt at Real Madrid and Los Angeles Galaxy) then dump them in at the deep end. Though perhaps he wouldn't put it in quite such sadistic terms: he compares his method, rather, to playing music students Beethoven, or giving English students Shakespeare. \"They don't get everything that's going on in Shakespeare, but we're still quite prepared to throw it at them. Well, why aren't we throwing something like the Riemann hypothesis [which would explain how the primes are distributed through the universe of numbers] at them? It's exciting, it's got big ideas, it's got things that you can engage with - although you won't understand the whole thing. That was the mission of my Christmas lectures - to choose a great unsolved problem to lead up to in each lecture, and you know, show them things I don't know how to do. To say, 'I don't understand this, and the goal is for us to try - you're the next generation. You do this.' I think it is possible. It's just we're a bit timid about it.\" </p> <p>Some of it has nothing to do with numbers at all. \"One of the themes in [Finding Moonshine] is about how many of the advances we've made in mathematics are about finding the right language to capture a structure. You know - how do you see in four dimensions? That's something I think you can explain to a kid, and they get quite excited about it - wow! I can see in four dimensions!\" Now we're talking about leaps of faith, aren't we? \"I wouldn't say faith, no - that's a dangerous word, especially in relation to this professorship.\" (This issue is relevant because Richard Dawkins, the previous incumbent is, not to put too fine a point on it, a bit of an atheistic fundamentalist.) \"I think very often the exciting moments in mathematical history are moments when suddenly there's a leap of imagination - for example, the idea of negative numbers, or zero - I mean, that's almost as imaginary as a four-dimensional shape. What's a negative number? I can't show you minus three potatoes - but let's come up with the idea of a negative number and the way that it will behave and explore that. That's why it's a creative subject. It's a lot about creative intuition.\"</p> <p>Du Sautoy once wrote that \"in Einstein's view, the ultimate test for an equation was an aesthetic one. The highest praise for a good theory was not that it was correct or that it was exact, simply that it should be beautiful.\" This doesn't sound particularly scientific to me. \"I think what Einstein was getting at was that mathematics and physics has a lot of beauty in it, and often that's a good motivating force to try and find the right answer. Quite often the answer that you want to discover is probably the most beautiful one - something like Occam's razor, which holds that nature seems to like things that have an in-built simplicity and beauty to them. So in my work, if I look for a direction that I think looks exciting and aesthetically pleasing, often that will be the direction where the right answer lies.\" But isn't that quite a self-fulfilling approach? \"No, because sometimes it's wrong! So for example, there was a theorem - a conjecture - I was working on for 10 years. I thought there was a beautiful symmetry happening in my equations. And I worked for 10 years, trying to prove why it would always be there, and then a student comes along and shows me an example where it didn't have this beautiful symmetry, where it all kind of broke down.\" He claims this discovery had a silver lining, in that he can now explore the new textures it has thrown up; at the time, as he puts it in Finding Moonshine, it was like having \"Oedipus sitting here in my office\". </p> <p>How about the God question? \"Well, I'm an atheist,\" he says, backing away slightly and gripping the kitchen counter. \"When people ask me what my religion is, I say it's the Arsenal. That's my kind of irrational ...\" But all this talk of beauty and nature, surely that's just as irrational? Apparently not. \"Because we have the power of proof - I can prove with 100% certainty that there are infinitely many primes, and nobody's going to question that. And that is, I think, why I was drawn to mathematics out of all the sciences. What the Greeks proved 2,000 years ago is as true today as it was 2,000 years ago. And actually - when I look through the history of my subject, very often you find that mathematicians have had quite tough childhoods, and have been drawn to mathematics as a place of security, as something that's not going to break down. That's an appealing side to the subject.\"</p> <p>Du Sautoy was not a maths-as-party trick kind of child; he has said that his parents were told not to bother entering him for selective schools because he couldn't spell or do times tables. Like countless small boys he wanted to be James Bond; unlike countless small boys, he had a mother who had worked at the foreign office (an inventive, artistic woman, she spun this out, pretending she had a little black gun hidden somewhere in the house). So he tried to learn languages, but they infuriated him by refusing to behave logically. It was only when a discerning maths teacher noticed he liked patterns and started recommending books to him that he found his metier. One especially, A Mathematician's Apology by GH Hardy, which was about the business of \"being a mathematician - and it brought out the aesthetic side, the creative side. It kept on comparing maths to writing poetry. And it had two little proofs in there. One why there are infinitely many primes, and one why the square root of two is not a fraction, and they were just so beautiful, and turned you on!\" His voice goes a little squeaky. \"You suddenly could prove things about infinity! You know? That's amazing!\"</p> <p>After an undergraduate degree at Oxford he entered All Souls, where, as Matthew d'Ancona, then also a fellow, wrote last week, he stuck out because he \"liked the Happy Mondays and New Order ... dressed like a student, had changeable hair colour, was a great cook, loved music and Arsenal, and spent his evenings at theatre workshops.\" Du Sautoy has compared All Souls to being like \"living in a 1920s novel. I was dining in college every night, fine wines, headache in the morning.\" It was too rarefied; he left for the Hebrew University in Israel, where more people study what he does: primes, and group theory, the study of what symmetries are possible. Essentially, he spends his days envisioning shapes twisting through hyperspace, in up to 196,883 dimensions - in fact, into infinity. (Donate a minimum of $10 to the Guatemalan street-kids' charity Common Hope, and he'll name a symmetry he discovers after you.) </p> <p>In Israel he met his wife, Shani, who thought the fact that he was learning Arabic and spending all his time in East Jerusalem rather funny; she was then a website designer and is now a trained psychologist. He works at home, in his counter-intuitively messy office (he finds searching for things helps him make connections). He doesn't do long hours, because he finds his work exhausting. \"I can often be squirming around so much in my chair trying to work out what's going on that I've probably ended up running, you know, 10km by the end of the day.\" Most of it gets scribbled down on yellow legal pads, rather than entered into a computer, \"because actually, when you're trying to explore the infinite, a computer isn't terribly helpful\". </p> <p>And in fact he finds the infinite consoling. His eldest son, Tomer, calls, and as we stride out across Stoke Newington to meet the school bus, past dog-walking hoodies, women returning from work, a grey-bearded Hasid carefully cycling along a dark park, he talks about the child they lost, at term; the fact that Shani was then in a coma for two weeks and no longer able to have children. \"It was like a bomb going off in our lives. Nobody was able to provide a rational explanation of what the hell had happened. And that I found very difficult to deal with. So I did the classic male thing of just hiding in my subject. And I found the security of what I do very reassuring.\" Surrogacy didn't work so they adopted, twin girls from Guatemala who are now five. </p> <p>Mathematics (as he almost always calls it, as opposed to maths) may not explain everything in life, but he considers it his mission to show how it is involved in nearly everything: on the way back we talk about how jazz musicians play with time, and infinite divisions of time; how Fibonacci numbers were first discovered not by Fibonacci, but by Indian musicians, \"because actually these numbers describe the number of different rhythm patterns you can make with long and short beats\". He often works with composer Dorothy Ker; for the last three years they have collaborated on a piece of experimental music in which, as Ker puts it, \"we imagine a four-dimensional space through paths of movement, sound structures and projected imagery\" and combined it with an interpretation of Borges' The Library of Babel; The 19th Step was performed early this year. We discuss the mathematical models beloved of hedge-fund managers, the maths involved in predicting the weather - the degree to which to understand mathematics is to wield a very real-world kind of power. As well, of course, as in more esoteric realms. He once referred to the \"arrogant superior manner that mathematicians can have about truth, as if they alone are its custodians\". He laughs. \"Gosh, did I say that? Um - well, I think there is something about the power of proof, that you can be so confident in it. I think there are very few other areas, even other sciences, where you can be so certain about something. So yeah - I think it does give you confidence in what you know. That's important to me, as I said. I don't like things where I can't pin down what's happened. I like the power of mathematics to take you from a place that you're happy with to a new place which is unexpected, but you're still totally certain that it's true\".</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Audio: </strong>Marcus du Sautoy on the Simonyi professorship <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/science\">theguardian.com/science</a></p>",
  "<p>Form and content are calculatedly at odds in Lloyd Newson's latest DV8 show. It is a verbatim piece, based on 86 interviews and vox pops, about the cultural and religious roots of homophobia, using the physical expressiveness for which the company is famous. Much as I endorse the show's plea for tolerance, I found that the prodigious inventiveness of Newson's production sometimes obscured the spoken material.</p> <p>Newson and his team remind us of some shocking facts. More than 80 countries still criminalise same-sex relationships, and, under sharia law, the death penalty is invoked in seven of them. In Jamaica, dancehall music is often vehemently anti-gay; elsewhere, many Christian organisations - and some non-Christian ones - advocate reorientation for homosexuals. But we are told that Nelson Mandela has argued that sexual persecution is as unjust as apartheid, and that, in the UK, Peter Tatchell has vigorously campaigned against so-called \"murder music\".</p> <p>While heightening our awareness, the show frequently suffers from sensory overload: the vivacious movement, Uri Omi's cleverly projected designs and the pounding music often make it hard to listen. However, where style and content coalesce, the show takes off. The supreme example is the testimony of a 15-year-old Muslim boy, who whirls around the stage with a skipping-rope while describing how he was beaten up by his dad for being a \"poof\". And I was moved by the story of an imam whose features are gradually blacked out as he describes the hidden nature of homosexuality in the Muslim world. </p> <p>Newson possesses a dazzling theatrical imagination, and he knows how to use bodies in space. But his message would be even stronger with, as Gertrude said to Polonius, more matter and less art.</p>"
