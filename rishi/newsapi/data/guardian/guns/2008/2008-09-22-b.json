  "<p>With the Premier League table looking ugly, Sir Alex Ferguson must prefer to rest his eyes on the fixture list. In that competition at any rate there is no further business to be done at Anfield or Stamford Bridge. It is a novelty to find Manchester United languishing in 15th place, but they have a game in hand over everyone other than Fulham. As crises go, it is a bit of an anticlimax.</p> <p>Old Trafford devotees will expect rivals to falter. Liverpool were held by Stoke City on Saturday and it is premature to announce the birth of an era for Arsenal, impressive as it was to see the squad come back from Kiev and rally at the Reebok to win 3-1. Chelsea, too, have not yet shown conclusively that they are equipped for the long march to the title, not while one of their two main forwards, Didier Drogba, has a bad knee and the other, Nicolas Anelka, suffers from an inscrutable unreliability.</p> <p>The obstacles for United lie within the club as much as in the ranks of the challengers. A year ago Ferguson's squad also had five points from the opening four league games yet went on to take the title. If there has been an unsettling change since then it lies simply in the passage of time. </p> <p>The manager is smart in utilising the last traces of excellence from the remarkable generation that arose in the 1990s. At Stamford Bridge Ryan Giggs was at least available on the bench, Gary Neville came into the line-up at the expense of Wes Brown and Paul Scholes started. Where athletes are concerned, however, there is no escape from the law of diminishing returns. </p> <p>Even though Ferguson has been crafty in his attempt to keep Scholes to the fore, compromises are unavoidable. Stationing him nearer to the back four spares him some running and ensures that his reservoir of football intelligence is available to the team, but he can no longer be a mischievous threat in the opposition's area. </p> <p>After the Champions League had been won in May, Ferguson spoke about rationing Scholes's appearances, but he cannot quite bring himself to impose that policy just yet. The midfielder has been present at kick-off in every game for which he has been eligible this season, including such ephemeral occasions as the Community Shield and the European Super Cup. </p> <p>Scholes, who will be 34 in November, missed last week's Champions League match with Villarreal through suspension. He does need a breather of some sort or other; in the gruelling games at Liverpool and Chelsea he lasted 66 and 55 minutes respectively. </p> <p>Ferguson has done as much as he conceivably can to engineer a smooth transition but great players must always be missed as their influence fades to vanishing point. Anderson, who converted nervelessly in the shoot-out that settled the Champions League final, should become a devastating midfielder but he is only 20 and was not even on the bench at Chelsea after a colourless showing against Liverpool. As consecutive league titles prove, Ferguson does not require any period of seclusion in which the squad can regroup without the obligation to accumulate trophies.</p> <p>There are many splendid footballers at his disposal, but it did not escape the manager's notice that there were imbalances. He refused to take it for granted that Cristiano Ronaldo would score another 42 goals in this campaign, so he spent \u00a330.75m on Dimitar Berbatov to ensure there was a centre-forward with style, finesse and height around whom an attack should coalesce. Unfortunately the Bulgarian is making a slow re-emergence from a quiet spell that started once Tottenham had been knocked out of the Uefa Cup in mid-March.</p> <p>United are not in any kind of crisis and rivals may have far worse spells to endure, but there are many small disturbances. Edwin van der Sar, for instance, has begun to look his 37 years. Of the understudies, the currently injured Ben Foster, at 25, is yet to prove himself and Tomasz Kuszczak, coming off the bench at Stamford Bridge, was to blame for Chelsea's equaliser.</p> <p>Ferguson's mind also has to churn with conventional topics. With more proof now given, for instance, that Wayne Rooney needs to be in the centre, how are Berbatov and Carlos Tevez both to be accommodated? It is facile to snort that these are dilemmas all other managers covet. United have grounds for thinking themselves the finest team in the world but Ferguson, at 66, faces a severe test to place the club at the head of the Premier League once again.</p>",
  "<p>Craig Mackail-Smith reminded me of a rampaging Nordic Viking with his long blond hair and the way he picked up the ball and ran at defenders. He was always positive and attacked at every opportunity. It all proved too much for his opponents.</p> <p>I watched him in Peterborough's match against Bristol Rovers in League One and saw him work their entire back four, track counter-attacking defenders, fill in for team-mates when they were caught out of position and provide a constant option to anyone on the ball.</p> <p>Given the smallest amount of time and space on the ball, he was looking to put the opposition on the back foot and he frightened defenders into dropping deeper than they might like. It meant the pitch became bigger when his team had possession, allowing them room to play.</p> <p>He has developed a decent partnership with Aaron McLean and they were instrumental in the build-up to each other's goals - one, a beautiful one-two on the edge of the box and the other a great first-time pass which was timed to perfection. They complemented each other in the final third of the pitch and I liked the way one went short and the other long when the ball was deep in their half and the full-back was in possession.</p> <p>There are one or two rough edges: his hold-up play could be improved and his pass appreciation, mostly regarding the weight of the ball, needs fine-tuning.</p> <p>But more important than technique was the fact that he always spotted that early ball. For someone who plays the game at such a rate of knots, that is no mean feat.</p> <p>I liked the way Mackail-Smith seemed to change pace in the box. He is an extremely clinical finisher - cool, calm and aware of exactly how much time he had to execute his goal. Talking of goals, I must be lucky because this is the second player I've seen score a hat-trick this season. On the evidence of this match it certainly won't be his last.</p> <p>I say that because each of the goals was different, which is a good sign. His third was a goal of quite stunning quality: after picking up the ball 35 yards out he turned quickly between two onrushing midfielders and, seeing no obvious pass, decided he had nothing to lose and ran at the Rovers defence. He ghosted past one and dropped his shoulder between two others, then found the corner of the net from an acute angle with his left foot. It was a goal to grace any game in the world.</p> <p>Mackail-Smith had a strange start to his career as he scored only two goals in 45 appearances for St Albans but somehow John Still at Dagenham &amp; Redbridge saw something in him. It was there that he started to realise that undoubted potential, averaging a goal every three games before a \u00a3120,000 move to Peterborough United has seen his scoring ratio rise to one in two.</p> <p>It seems like the better the players he appears alongside, the better he becomes. Only 18 months out of non-league football, this lad is a work in progress, constantly evaluating what it takes to be a full-time professional. But on this evidence you could call him the teacher's pet as, believe me, he's a very quick learner.</p> <h2>How he rates</h2> <p><strong>Age </strong>24</p> <p><strong>Born</strong> Hertford</p> <p><strong>Position </strong>Striker</p> <p><strong>Height </strong>6ft 3in </p> <p><strong>Weight</strong> 12st 4lb</p> <p><strong>From </strong>Dagenham &amp; Redbridge</p> <p><strong>Awareness </strong>8/10 </p> <p><strong>Heading </strong>8/10</p> <p><strong>Shooting </strong>9/10</p> <p><strong>Pace </strong>9/10</p> <p><strong>Team responsibility</strong> 9/10</p> <p><strong>Valuation</strong> \u00a3750,000</p>",
  "<p>Banks should put aside reserves in the good times that they can draw down in times of bust to prevent crises such as that now pulling down whole economies, Bank of England deputy governor Sir John Gieve said yesterday.</p> <p>Outlining practical regulatory measures that could prevent banks' behaviour getting out of hand and which put flesh on the bones of the promises by Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling to clamp down on City excesses, Gieve said these should be used alongside interest rate setting to provide the central bank with a better set of tools to control the economy. \"We need to create reserves based on macroeconomic factors, which can be drawn down as the cycle turns down and have to be replenished on the upswing when profits are high,\" said Gieve.</p> <p>He pointed to Spain's \"dynamic provisioning\" system as having worked well in the credit crunch.</p> <p>Although Darling thinks there are considerable practical problems with forcing banks to make provisions during good times to draw on in bad, Gieve is a key part of government efforts to rein in some of the City's more dubious activities and therefore carries considerable weight.</p> <p>Gieve also said he now thought the dampening effect of the credit crunch on the economy could be bigger than thought - a possible hint he could soon be leaning towards voting for an interest rate cut.</p> <p>Meanwhile, finance ministers and central bank governors of the G7 industrial nations welcomed the $700bn (\u00a3382bn) US bailout plan for the financial industry and vowed to take \"whatever actions may be necessary\" to ensure the stability of the global financial system. US Treasury secretary Henry Paulson said he was \"aggressively\" encouraging other countries to copy his scheme. But there was little sign other governments were ready to follow Washington's lead in setting up funds to buy bad debts from crisis-stricken banks.</p>",
  "<p>Naomi Klein is right (After a week of turmoil, has the world changed?, September 20). The ideology of the free market is not dead. Vampire economics will survive because, like its more famous counterpart, it is not only parasitical but is also based on the ability of capitalism in the United States to employ overwhelming force on behalf of its interests. In this way it is no different from the British imperialism of free trade in the 19th century.</p> <p>Whereas productive industry, like Rover, was allowed to go to the wall in the name of standing on one's own two feet and not supporting lame ducks, a completely different attitude has been taken to the banks and finance sector. </p> <p>Although financial commentators are usually too polite to point it out, what the Bush administration has done is entirely consistent with its philosophy. Having cut the taxes of the rich, it has now rescued them from the consequences of their own gambling. And who pays? Those mug enough to pay taxes in the first place, ie the working and middle classes, who stand to lose their own homes.<br><strong>Tony Greenstein</strong><br>Brighton</p> <p>Even a recovering Trot like me has to admit that Tristram Hunt is probably right when he says that capitalism will recover from this crisis, deep as it is (Groundhog capitalism, September 20). After all, it managed to recover from the 1930s (the small matter of fascism, Stalinism and the second world war aside). But what is essential is that the Labour movement and its political party must now reassert the primacy of political control over untrammelled economic profligacy. This crisis was not just about a splurge of short selling and speculation, but is built into the nature of capitalism itself, with its primacy of profit-seeking at all costs. <br><strong>Peter Thompson</strong><br>Director, Centre for Ernst Bloch Studies, University of Sheffield</p> <p>Tristram Hunt misunderstands Marx and Engels. They did indeed predict both the inevitability and unpredictability of a capitalist crisis, personified in Robin Goodfellow, the old mole of revolution, burrowing in the earth and popping up in unexpected places. But the inevitability of the demise of capitalism? Forget it. As Marx himself noted in 1864, the emancipation of the working class is the act of the working class itself.<br><strong>Keith Flett</strong><br>London</p> <p>I'm confused. Are the undeserving beneficiaries of the City bonus culture so trenchantly criticised by Alistair Darling and Gordon Brown (Brown plans crackdown on world markets, September 22) some of the same people earning \"huge salaries\" whose success, on the eve of the last budget, we were all exhorted to celebrate by their ministerial colleague John Hutton and whose moral justification he said we should not question (The minister for fatcats is stuck in a Blairite time warp, March 11)? And does their criticism extend to the \"staggering bonuses\" received by Treasury staff like the \u00a321.5m shelled out in 2005-06 (Report, October 20 2007)?<br><strong>Paul Clein</strong><br>Liverpool</p> <p>At last we should give Alistair Darling a bit of credit for his brilliant far-sightedness when he said that the economic times we are facing \"are arguably the worst they've been in 60 years. And I think it's going to be more profound and long-lasting than people thought\" (Reports, August 30). This analysis was dismissed as alarmist, but we clearly have a chancellor whose prescience is vastly underestimated. What we now wait to see is whether his spot-on analysis will translate into government intervention which will curb the excesses of deregulated financial markets.<br><strong>Phil Powell and Sarah Loving</strong><br>Oxford</p> <p>Phew! Now the Large Hadron Collider at Cern is shut down, maybe the black hole into which the financial system was disappearing will cease functioning (Giant particle collider may be shut down until next year, September 22). Perhaps the doom merchants were right after all. <br><strong>Chris Sanders</strong><br>Dunstable, Befordshire</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown will today seek to end the corrosive speculation surrounding his premiership with a speech in which he will promise to extend the welfare state, close the digital divide, and steer Britain through the global fiscal turmoil.</p> <p>In what is seen as the most important speech of his career after months of criticism, the prime minister will not directly attack the rebels calling for his removal, but seek to show he has the grit, intellect and grasp of the future to take Labour to a fourth term. One aide said: \"The speech's subtext is to prove there is no other politician than Brown that has the knowledge and experience to take the country through last week's threats to the whole edifice of British banking.\"</p> <p>Rather than dwelling on the setbacks and mistakes of the past 12 months, Brown will unveil initiatives aimed at lifting families and pensioners most vulnerable to the steep economic downturn, including:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Computers and free broadband access for children lacking internet usage.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Extended help for carers with sick or elderly relatives.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A \u00a31bn extension of childcare for children as young as two.</p> <p>Brown's speech, described as highly personal by his aides, has been set as a vital test by some disillusioned MPs, who doubt he can ever communicate a vision of what Labour is offering the country.</p> <p>And in a sign of the ongoing tension between supporters of Brown and David Miliband, a row broke out last night when the BBC reported Miliband had been overheard saying he toned down his conference speech in order to avoid outshining Brown. The BBC reported that the foreign secretary was heard telling an aide: \"I couldn't have gone any further. It would have been a Heseltine moment\" - an apparent reference to the idea Margaret Thatcher's demise was hastened by brilliant performances by her rival, Michael Heseltine. Miliband supporters said the report was incorrect, and spread by Brown aides.</p> <p>In a touch intended to underline Brown's seriousness, as opposed to what he considers the showmanship of David Cameron, he will speak from a lectern, without notes. He will tell delegates that he will spend \u00a3300m over three years giving 1.4 million children access to the internet with free broadband and computers.</p> <p>Vouchers worth from \u00a3100 to \u00a3700 will be given out by schools to unconnected households for broadband, software, and, if necessary, computers, so children can use open-learning techniques or equip themselves with IT skills.</p> <p>The government also believes the scheme will help teachers raise contact with parents on homework, their child's progress, and discipline.</p> <p>Ministers want parents and teachers to have regular internet contact, not once-a-term meetings.</p> <p>The money has been found by the schools minister, Jim Knight, through savings elsewhere in the children department's budget. He said it showed that even in tough economic times the government could find resources to reduce inequality and improve the life chances of millions.</p> <p>Many at the conference hope to hear not just a strong condemnation of City bonuses in Brown's speech, but also some intimation of action, or even a hint that taxes on the very rich will rise.</p> <p>In his speech yesterday, the chancellor, Alistair Darling, warned that \"huge bonuses can distort the way decisions\" are made by banks, but later indicated he did not plan any early legislation or taxes. He stressed that any solution would probably need to be global. Darling is acutely aware that, with so many jobs depending on financial services, he cannot afford to allow the rhetorical attacks on the City to get out of hand.</p> <p>Richard Lambert, CBI director general, said he had been given assurances by the party leaders yesterday that the left were \"whistling in the dark\" if they thought an ideological sea change towards City regulation was taking place at the top.</p> <p>Darling did continue to pave the way for higher borrowing, claiming the government could afford to \"let borrowing rise to support the economy and the families when they need it most\".</p> <p>In contrast, Miliband tried to lift the mood by saying \"these Tories are beatable\", adding: \"Just as I hate defeatism about our country, I hate defeatism about our party.\" The Brown camp was lifted by the Miliband speech , saying it did not represent a threat to his grip on power.</p> <p>Meanwhile the leadership brushed aside defeats when delegates backed a windfall tax on utilities, and an end to the opt-out on the 48-hour working week in the working-time directive. Both will be sent for further consideration.</p>",
  "<p>David Miliband yesterday set out a vision of how Labour could defeat David Cameron when he called on the party to abandon \"defeatism\" and replace it with a message of hope.</p> <p>In his main speech to the Labour conference, the foreign secretary signalled his readiness to lead when he declared that the party should be \"out there, active, engaged around the world\".</p> <p>Speaking after a high-profile series of media appearances at the weekend - and amid signs that he is being lined up by Blairite cabinet ministers as their candidate should Gordon Brown stand down - Miliband trod a careful path to ensure he could not stand accused of launching a leadership bid.</p> <p>He lavished praise on the prime minister and delivered an upbeat message, which weaved between foreign and domestic affairs, in an attempt to challenge the Labour party to stir itself from a slumber in the face of the Tory leader's decisive lead in the opinion polls.</p> <p>Borrowing Bill Clinton's famous rallying cry from the 1992 US presidential campaign - that he came \"from a place called Hope\" - Miliband told the Labour party to ensure that \"hope\" defeats fatalism. \"The test for every speech of this conference: to defeat fatalism and replace it with hope,\" he told delegates.</p> <p>Miliband said: \"Now is not the time to turn back. We should be out there, active, engaged around the world, pursuing our values, persuading people about them, putting them into practice.</p> <p>\"So, just as I hate defeatism about our country - defeatism that says we won't make a difference, so let's not bother to try, defeatism that stands in the way of the evidence - I hate defeatism about our party.\"</p> <p>His cautious approach prompted some critics to say he had blown an opportunity to set out his stall. But his supporters said he had struck a balance and had touched on domestic politics, with a message about how to defeat the Conservatives, for just enough time to avoid unsettling the conference.</p> <p>Miliband outlined how to attack Cameron when he said: \"These Tories are beatable. Let's say it with conviction: These Tories are beatable. We know what we believe in in this party. That everyone should have a fair chance and those who succeed should put something back. That if government is not on your side then it's a case of sink or swim. That a fair society is a necessity, not a strapline. And also that an age of massive change needs leadership from a party dedicated to change.\"</p> <p>Miliband set out his message of hope in the context of his own family background and in his current role as foreign secretary. He opened the speech with an account of how an application to settle in Britain by his grandfather, Samuel, was initially denied by James Chuter Ede, the home secretary in the post war Labour government. He was MP for South Shields, the seat now held by the foreign secretary.</p> <p>Britain had provided his family with hope and a chance, Miliband said, as he spoke of how the famous vision of Ernest Bevin, Labour's foreign secretary during the postwar period, had now come true. This was to go to Victoria station and buy a train ticket to anywhere in Europe.</p> <p>\"That bright hope out of the dark days of war can motivate us today,\" he said. \"If they could do it, then so can we.\"</p> <p>Miliband hailed Labour's commitment to international development and to banning cluster munitions as a sign of the party's optimistic belief that \"the future is not fated\". In both areas he lavished praise on Brown.</p> <p>The prime minister had been an \"inspiration\" in the way he had transformed the debate on international development, he said. Brown had also single-handedly broken the deadlock in talks last May to ban cluster munitions.</p> <p>\"Those talks were deadlocked. And the deadlock was broken by one man - our prime minister, Gordon Brown. That is the sort of difference he makes in the world,\" he told the conference.</p> <p>Miliband launched a strong attack on Cameron, accusing the Conservative party leader of \"dissing\" the US and of marginalising Britain in Europe.</p> <p>\"Answer me this, Mr Cameron: how are you going to lead the European Union on climate change when you have said that your first act in Europe will not be about climate change, it will be to renegotiate the social chapter that gives rights to working people in Britain?\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Late one snowy night in Chicago I left my friend's apartment and went out to my car. On the windscreen I found a note intended for someone else, a man named Mario. Since school I have been collecting notes, letters, photographs, and other stuff I found on the ground. It always amazes me how powerfully I could connect with a person I'd never met just by reading a half-page love letter left behind on a park bench or a bus. When I discovered Amber's note to Mario, I was so moved by its blend of anger and longing that I knew I needed to find a way to share it with the world. A few days later, I had an idea: why not publish a magazine and print Amber's note along with the rest of the incredible finds my friends and I had turned up over the years.</p> <p>Over the following months, I passed out flyers inviting people to send in stuff they had found. At first, I didn't hear anything. Then, suddenly, I did. Found notes came in from as far away as Alaska and Bangladesh. They were by turns beautiful, hilarious and heartbreaking. Once I had gathered a decent stack of material and combed through my own collection of found stuff, my friend Jason Bitner and I went to work for three nights cutting and pasting with scissors and tape and put together the first issue of Found magazine.</p> <p>The response completely stunned and overwhelmed me. Found stuff began pouring in from all over the globe. I had no idea so many people shared my fascination with found stuff and other people's lives. People have written in who have been collecting these treasures since before my parents were born. And a lot of people - particularly in small, rural towns - said, \"All these years I've been picking up stuff off the streets and everyone here thinks I'm a freak. But now I see that I am not alone!\" I love that. It's exciting to sense an invisible community emerging from the shadows and finding each other.</p> <p>But what I love most about this project is that everyone can play. People who have never been into finding things before have told me that they have begun to look at the world in a new way. We have had finds from dozens of countries and every state in the US. Finds arrived one week from both Iceland and Greenland, which I thought was a kind of coup. Kids as young as six years old have sent them in.</p> <p>I ask people to name their finds, just as they would name a painting or a song they'd written. Picking a note up from the ground - something that everyone else has walked past and seen as rubbish - seems to me an equally noble act of creation. We're always careful to give credit to the person who has found each item; they deserve recognition for rescuing their find from the gutter and giving it a new life.</p> <p>Found notes and letters open up the entire range of human experience; they offer a shortcut directly to people's minds and hearts. We often feel most alive when we're glimpsing someone at their most honest and raw. I think that's because when we read these notes, there's a powerful moment of recognition; we see another person - maybe someone very different from us - experiencing the same thoughts, feelings and emotions that we've experienced. It's startling and it's magical. Suddenly, we feel connected to this person we've never met before and probably never will, and in turn, to all people. The idea that we all share the same universal emotions and experiences - that we're all connected - strikes me as profoundly beautiful.</p> <p>Some finds feel incomplete: they hint at a story but withhold important details. The things you don't know are often as fascinating as the things you do. Part of the joy of finding something is the imaginative process that ensues, trying to piece together a narrative that will make sense of things. There are questions to be answered: who wrote this? What do some of these strange, cryptic phrases mean exactly? How did this thing end up here? Was this note trashed by the person who wrote it or the person who received it? It's up to the finder to guess at these riddles, knowing they will never be truly answered.</p> <p>People ask me where the best places to find stuff are. Certainly, some spots are more fertile than others. I like pavements and bushes, all forms of public transport, school playgrounds, recycling bins and university computer centres. While I appreciate the efforts of determined finders who dig through skips looking for troves of abandoned letters, I think it's a mistake to believe that you have to go far out of your way to find things. It's more a matter of simply keeping your eyes peeled during your everyday wanderings. On your way to work, on your way to school, be aware of what's around you. And if you see a piece of paper lying there with writing on it, take a second and a half to pick it up and check it out. Four out of five notes you pick up might not be anything too interesting, but that fifth one will always be a gem.</p> <p>I always tend to get consumed by my little daily problems. I worry about girls and money and what the hell I did with my keys. Looking round for found stuff is good for me because it brings me back to the present moment. I'm bought out of my own head and into the world around me. I start listening to conversations between strangers, gazing at people's faces. Even if I don't find any wonderful notes on the ground, my day is far richer for having deeply experienced my surroundings.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>This is an edited extract from <strong>Found</strong>, published by Cassell Illustrated on October 6, priced \u00a39.99.</p>",
  "<p>It all began well enough. South Africans, black and white, loved Nelson Mandela. They virtually swooned at his feet, marvelling at his inspiration and example and wondering if the country could have been saved without him. But in 1999, at the end of the great man's five years as president, there was a consensus that his job of unifying the reborn nation was done and what was required was someone who knew how to run a government. </p> <p>It was the moment that Thabo Mbeki had spent four decades of his life working toward, and South Africa was ready for him. He had been Mandela's deputy president during the previous five years of African National Congress (ANC) rule in the immediate post-apartheid years. </p> <p>\"Mbeki pretty much ran the show from 1994,\" says Mark Gevisser, author of the most authoritative biography to date of Mbeki. \"He was Mandela's de facto prime minister. His approach was very technocratic, about establishing systems of government, and he worked very hard to do that and was effective in many ways. It's what people expected and hoped for from his presidency.\"</p> <p>But Mbeki offered more than that. He had laid out his grand vision of his continent's renaissance with his inspiring \"I am an African\" speech in 1996 as South Africa adopted its post-apartheid constitution. Two years later a conference on the African renaissance followed, and a book. By the time Mbeki took power, it was clear that he intended Africa's revival to be the central thrust of his years in power. He spoke of a new golden era for the continent and predicted this would be the African century.</p> <p>Andrew Feinstein was a junior ANC member of parliament at the time. \"I was never a great Mbeki admirer but I remember sitting on the backbenches of parliament in the first few months of his administration and thinking to myself he's actually the right guy for this time. This is the man we need. And I think it's gone horrifically wrong,\" he says.</p> <p>Nine years later, as Mbeki prepares to leave office prematurely, humiliated and rejected by the party he dedicated half a century of his life to, there are few who do not believe he was the architect of his own downfall. The vision of a new Africa has long since been buried under the years of vilification for fiddling with intellectual debate over the origins of Aids while hundreds of thousands of the people died of the disease. The promise of good administration has given way to accusations that he purged state institutions of critics, interfered with the justice system and protected corrupt officials from investigation, most notably the country's police chief, who was accused of links to organised crime and covering up a murder. </p> <p>Even Mbeki's much vaunted economic policies, which have seen growth and financial stability, are vilified by the people now taking over the country as enriching a new black elite but leaving the mass of poor behind.</p> <p>And where there was goodwill and support, Mbeki now leaves behind a host of enemies. But it is perhaps fitting that in the end the man most notorious for denying a lifeline to people with Aids should have seen his political career consumed by a virus he planted in South Africa's body politic before he even became president, and which lay unnoticed for years until it came to infect almost everything about Mbeki's administration. </p> <p>Thabo Mbeki had returned from exile in 1990, when Mandela was released from prison, after transforming the international perception of the ANC from an African liberation movement of dubious ability to a party that was fit to govern. \"He was an immensely good salesman for the ANC,\" says Gevisser. \"He seduced the world into loving the ANC and seduced white South Africans in to believing they could have a black president. He did that incredibly well because he was in the service of a greater cause. But once power was his, he wielded it quite uncomfortably. He was susceptible to the kind of politics of plotting and conspiracy that characterised life in exile. And he never really overcame that and I think that was one of his biggest failures.\"</p> <p>Feinstein agrees. \"There's no doubt that he centralised virtually all control. It was almost Leninist. It was based on the pretext that all power should be vested in the leader and there should be no gainsaying of the leader. The most obvious manifestation of that was on HIV and Aids, where he wouldn't allow any discussion within the ANC caucus on it,\" he says.</p> <p>Mbeki saw the disease, like much else, through a racial prism. It was used, he said, to reinforce stereotypes of Africans as primitive and unable to control their lust. The president was a natural target for the dissident scientists who questioned the link between HIV and Aids, punting instead that the disease was the result of poverty. The anti-Aids antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) were poisoning people, they said.</p> <p>Mbeki was only too willing to be convinced. He began publicly to question the causes of Aids and, under the guise of ensuring the safety of drugs in wide use in the rest of the world, blocked the distribution of ARVs in government hospitals. Tens of thousands of babies who might have been saved were denied the single dose of a cheap drug at birth. Hundreds of thousands of adults were left to die while Mbeki held an intellectual debate, largely with himself, on the merits of drug therapy. Asked in a television interview if he would recommend the use of a condom to prevent catching HIV, Mbeki said that to agree would be to prove a particular paradigm. Most of the country had no idea what he was talking about. </p> <p>The Anglican archbishop of Cape Town, Njongonkulu Ndungane, described the government's Aids policies as \"as serious a crime against humanity as apartheid\". One of the country's leading Aids researchers - Malegapuru Makgoba, formerly one of Mbeki's confidants - said the government's inaction was tantamount to genocide. Schoolchildren called Mbeki \"Comrade Undertaker\".</p> <p>The largest and most effective civil campaign of the post-apartheid era was launched to get Mbeki to reverse his policies. The president said he was merely seeking an open debate, but those who disagreed with him were publicly vilified. Mbeki accused those who supported the conventional view that the virus could be spread through sexual contact of denigrating black people, and black people who agreed with them as \"negroes of enslaved minds\". </p> <p>The ANC distributed a fat document claiming that ARVs were an attempt to commit genocide against black people. The president misrepresented statistics to parliament in an attempt to cut his own government's Aids budget. Amid growing anger at home, and derision abroad that damaged Mbeki's image as a safe pair of hands, the president eventually allowed the life-saving drugs into the hospitals. But he didn't change his mind on Aids, and still hasn't.</p> <p>\"After publicly announcing he was withdrawing from the debate he came back to the ANC caucus and restated that he didn't believe HIV caused Aids and that this was a conspiracy of the pharmaceutical companies and the CIA against him,\" says Feinstein. </p> <p>The Aids debacle damaged Mbeki's standing enormously, and was a serious blow to his attempts to change international perceptions of Africa. The statesman was now seen as deeply unstable. It also alienated many former supporters and exposed his style of government. Mbeki surrounded himself with a clique, some of whom demonstrated a political ruthlessness and thuggery not seen in the Mandela era. The fight over Aids made clear that dissent would not be tolerated. </p> <p>No one, apparently, was above vilification. In 2002, Mbeki's allies attempted to link three prominent ANC officials - Cyril Ramaphosa, the party's former general secretary and chief negotiator with the apartheid government, and former provincial premiers Tokyo Sexwale and Mathews Phosa - to a coup plot against the president. \"The whole plot thing around Ramaphosa, Phosa and Sexwale was probably the most extreme manifestation of Mbeki's paranoia and vindictiveness, says Feinstein. \"You had a minister of police going on television and announcing there's a plot against the president whereas all that was happening was that people were campaigning in upcoming regional ANC conferences on anti-Mbeki platforms. This kind of thing took its toll over the years. The other thing is, he was never personally open to anybody and therefore I think people feel very little affection for him, which makes it a lot easier for people to act against him in this sort of way but also for the real visceral hatred to build up in the way that it has.\"</p> <p>Mbeki didn't know it but that hatred eventually manifested itself around a contagion he introduced into South African politics years earlier. Corruption was little noticed at first but in time spread through the system, infecting the government and its party, and ultimately bringing down the president. In the mid-90s South Africa was negotiating its biggest weapons buying deal ever with a clutch of arms manufacturers. There were those in the ANC and outside who asked why a relatively poor society embarking on the enormous challenge of trying to right apartheid's wrongs was spending billions of pounds on fighter jets, submarines and ships when there was no perceivable military threat. But such considerations were brushed aside as the government offered the - subsequently disproved - claim that the weapons contracts would generate large numbers of jobs. </p> <p>Mbeki was deputy president at the time and headed the parliamentary subcommittee awarding the contracts. Feinstein was the highest ranking ANC member of parliament's public accounts committee that later investigated those deals. He says he came to realise that not only was the arms deal as a whole unnecessary but that it had been infected with corruption as senior officials, including the defence minister, Joe Modise, lined their pockets and the ruling party filled its coffers with what amounted to bribe money.</p> <p>\"I do think that it marked a profound change in South African politics in that it was the point at which the interests of Mbeki, his ruling clique and the party became more important than the national interest to the extent that they were prepared to award these contracts where there was absolutely no logic or reason to award the contracts outside of the bribes that were received,\" he says.</p> <p>Among the examples of otherwise illogical contracts was a decision to pay \u00a31.5bn to buy planes from BAe Systems and Saab. \"Despite the fact that the air force did not want the planes, and they were two and a half times the cost of the planes the air force did want, an informal meeting involving Mbeki, Modise and others took the decision to go with them,\" says Feinstein.</p> <p>Modise then changed the requirements of the tender, removing cost as a factor, to ensure BAe/Saab was awarded the contract. The defence secretary, Pierre Steyn, resigned. Feinstein said investigators working with his committee uncovered evidence that Modise, who has since died, received millions of rands in illegal payments from BAe and a German weapons firm. </p> <p>The deals were a millstone around Mbeki's neck, and so began the cover-up. ANC members of the investigating parliamentary committee were called before party leaders including Essop Pahad, a minister and long-standing friend of Mbeki, who \"launched into a ferocious diatribe\".</p> <p>\"Who the fuck do you think you are, questioning the integrity of the government, the ministers and the president?\" he said. Feinstein refused to get in line, was sacked and eventually left the party. The government got its way and a neutered report appeared that took out the auditor general's criticisms and much else.</p> <p>\"Mbeki was chairperson of the subcommittee that made all the decisions on the arms deal,\" says Feinstein. \"I think that at a time when he was building up a reputation for competence, if it had been known that they took these sorts of decisions, I think it would have quite profoundly undermined his standing. It has continued to dog his presidency and raised a whole lot of questions about whether he has any interest in stamping out corruption. It seems to many people that he simply uses issues like corruption against his opponents rather than as governing principles,\" he says. \"It was the point at which Mbeki decided he was prepared to meddle with the institutions of state or undermine certain of the institutions of democracy in order to protect himself and others in the party. A few years later, he was happy to use the deal to undermine his political opponents again, misusing the institutions of state to do that.\"</p> <p>Mbeki initially covered for his deputy president, Jacob Zuma, when he was accused of corruption. But in 2005, Zuma's financial advisor was sentenced to 15 years in prison for procuring bribes on behalf of the deputy president from a French arms company. Mbeki sacked him. The president said he was acting in the national interest. Zuma suspected that the president had taken the opportunity to force out a growing political threat. From that followed what a high court judge recently described as a \"titanic political struggle\" for control of the ANC. The various interests that had come to loathe Mbeki over his policies, his style of government or his human failings coalesced around Zuma as he sought to stay out of jail by challenging the president for control of the ANC at the party's four-yearly conference in Polokwane last December. </p> <p>Mbeki offered a stout if long-winded defence of his policies laying out all that he had done for the country. He was too out of touch to realise it, but the emotional tide was with Zuma. Mbeki had alienated too many people. He was swept out as ANC leader as Zuma and his allies were elected to most of the senior posts. </p> <p>Mbeki was humiliated and disbelieving. But worse was to come. When prosecutors revived the corruption case against Zuma, his allies saw Mbeki's hand. Justice Chris Nicholson agreed, throwing it out earlier this month with a judgment that essentially accused the president and his cabinet of misusing the judicial system to get at Mbeki's political enemies. With that, Zuma and his allies at the top of the ANC moved and toppled Mbeki. The president had few friends and allies to defend him. They had all been driven away long ago. \"What he was known for was being able to play the political game and ultimately he was defeated in his own gutter politics really,\" says Feinstein. </p> <p>\"There is the old saying that all political careers end in failure but this is a political career ending in ultimate humiliation because the ANC has been Thabo Mbeki's life. The ANC has publicly and humiliatingly cast him out.\"</p> <p>Mbeki would like to be remembered for a growing economy, spending more per capita on poverty alleviation than any government and engineering a political deal in Zimbabwe. But millions of South Africans, such as Zackie Achmat, who was instrumental in pressuring the government to change its policies, cannot get past the huge blot of his Aids policies. \"Personally, I would have liked to see him impeached for causing the deaths of many hundreds of thousands of people living with HIV; for the corruption of the arms deal; for the undermining of every independent state institution,\" he says.</p> <p>Gevisser says all of that will remain Mbeki's legacy. \"Aids is going to remain a mark on Mbeki. The arms deal will remain a mark on him as well, and more so rather than less so. I don't think it's going to go away,\" he says. \"Everything that's happened to Mbeki is a consequence of the arms deal. If the arms deal is the poison well of South African politics, then it's Mbeki who contaminated the water\".</p>",
  "<p>Think carefully before reading any further, because you may not want to know. According to a survey by the Royal Mint, in March this year about two out of every 100 of the 1.47bn pound coins in circulation were forgeries. That's around 30m duff nuggets. And if one of them is in your pocket it is a criminal offence to spend it.</p> <p>\"There are often a number of clues in the general appearance of counterfeit \u00a31 coins,\" says a spokesman from the Royal Mint. \"First, the date and design on the reverse should correspond.\" Essentially, if the coin does not have the right picture for its year (Gateshead's Millennium bridge in 2007, for example) then it's a forgery. And the same applies to the inscription around the edge. (You can check both at <a href=\"http://www.royalmint.gov.uk.\">royalmint.gov.uk.</a>)</p> <p>\"Alternatively,\" he says, \"the milled edge may be poorly defined or the lettering uneven in depth and spacing.\" Other clues are if the Queen and the picture are faint, or not the same way up, or if the coin looks smart and shiny even though it has supposedly been jangling around 20 years. Fake pound coins usually do not work in vending machines either, although some might say that hardly differentiates them from the real ones.</p> <p>Official advice if you suspect that one of your coins is not genuine is to take it to your local police station and hand it over. Will people get their pound back? \"No, they won't,\" says a spokeswoman, this time for the Metropolitan police. \"If someone has surreptitiously given it to you, or it ends up in your hands, you have become a victim of crime. At the end of the day, you have a personal responsibility to check your own currency.\" So now you know. I'll leave you with your purse and your conscience.</p>",
  "<p>For deathly economy of wording, nothing much beats a pamphlet published by the Federal Bureau of Investigation entitled: WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION (WMD); A Pocket Guide. On this this single sheet of paper, America's celebrated crime-fighting organisation tells you everything you might want to know, if you didn't want to know much, about weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p>The pocket guide is crisply folded so that it has six sections, each an appealingly slim eight and one half inches tall by three and three quarter inches wide.</p> <p>The first section, which serves as the front cover, shows the title overlaid upon a red, white and black abstract design. A tiny logo and a line of small, crisp type indicate that this is a US government publication.</p> <p>The second section is all business. It gives the basic information: what is a weapon of mass destruction. The top half of this section says, in a very few words printed in a rather large font, that WMDs come in four varieties. That's all it says.</p> <p>The bottom half of the section shows three symbols:</p> <p>1. A yellow-and-black radiation hazard logo.</p> <p>2. An orange-and-black biohazard logo.</p> <p>3. A tilted square composed of four smaller squares, each a different colour, each with its own label: combustible; non-flammable gas; explosives and flammable solid.</p> <p>A carefully phrased instruction focuses our attention on these icons. It says: \"Recognise these universally accepted symbols but do not expect to see them on a WMD device.\"</p> <p>The phrase \"but do not expect to see them on a WMD device\" is in bold type. Any reader, even if he or she is a casual dolt, will see that this message is important, worth remembering, worth pondering.</p> <p>The rest of the guide - the other two thirds - contains background material about the FBI, spiced up with some colourful graphics.</p> <p>Sections 3 and 4 disclose that: \"The FBI is the lead for the investigative, intelligence and overall law enforcement activities related to a terrorist threat or incident.\" Then a short paragraph explains that WMDs are bad, not good. Large graphics - one a gleaming gold badge with an eagle and seven stars, the other a triangle of two-word slogans - efficiently occupy space that might otherwise have been stuffed with non-essential information.</p> <p>The fifth section lists telephone numbers for several FBI offices, and gives the mailing address (but not the phone number) of the FBI's headquarters in Washington, DC.</p> <p>The final section lists the seven US laws that pertain, or might possibly pertain, to weapons of mass destruction. One law has the intriguing name Stop Terrorist and Military Hoaxes Act. Another prohibits Tampering with Consumer Production that Affects Interstate Commerce.</p> <p>This is perhaps the only official pocket guide to WMD that is distributed to the public.

  "<p>Firearms officers who mistook Jean Charles de Menezes for a terrorist decided on an \"instant killing\" because they feared he would detonate a bomb, an inquest heard yesterday.</p> <p>The long-awaited examination of the Brazilian's death threatens the future of the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, because even his allies fear he may be damaged by new details of mistakes made in the hours leading up to the shooting on July 22 2005.</p> <p>In a video message sent to his staff yesterday, Blair said: \"There can be little doubt that this inquest will be the most testing tribunal the Met has faced since the Macpherson inquiry ... Our approach will be one of humility.\"</p> <p>At a criminal trial last year, the force was accused of trying to smear De Menezes by suggesting he rose to his feet when police entered the tube carriage either out of fear they were going to detain him because he was an illegal immigrant, or through nervousness caused by the use of cocaine. The coroner, Sir Michael Wright, said the Brazilian was \"lawfully\" in Britain. Tests showed he had used cocaine six to 12 hours before his death, but the coroner said: \"No expert has yet been able to say it would necessarily have affected him in any particular way.\"</p> <p>De Menezes was killed after boarding an underground train at Stockwell tube station the day after terrorists had tried to bomb London's transport system, the jury heard. They were told statements from firearms officers and their colleagues in surveillance clashed on whether he had been identified as a wanted terrorist who had tried to attack London the day before. </p> <p>The 27-year-old electrician was followed from a south London block of flats by police, who believed the address was being used by a terrorist, Hussain Osman.</p> <p>Wright said the surveillance officers from special branch had never \"positively identified\" the suspect as Osman. But he added that the leader of the firearms team, identified as Ralph, had given a statement saying he had heard a message over the surveillance radio saying it was \"definitely our man\", and that he was \"twitchy and nervous.\"</p> <p>Opening the inquest, being held at the Oval cricket ground to accommodate the lawyers and media attending, Wright went through the accounts of surveillance officers who had tried to identify whether the man they were following was the suspected terrorist. Wright said: \"It does appear ... that by the time Mr De Menezes had actually entered the underground system at Stockwell station, no member of the surveillance team had positively identified him as Osman.\"</p> <p>On the day of the shooting a firearms team was supposed to be at a south London address where Osman was suspected to be, but was out of place. Wright said the armed officers from the elite C019 unit were briefed at 7.45am by a senior officer that they might have to use \"unusual tactics\", which some officers took to mean a fatal shot: \"This belief was based on a police operational strategy for dealing with suicide bombers known as Operation Kratos.\"</p> <p>Another officer, Detective Chief Inspector Greg Purser, briefed the team 90 minutes before they opened fire. He said there were links between the July 21 and July 7 bombers, who killed 52 people. The coroner said the briefing continued with Purser describing how dangerous the suspects were: \"He described the individuals involved in the bombings as being, and I quote, 'deadly and determined' and 'up for it'.\"</p> <p>Just after 10am De Menezes entered the tube system with five surveillance officers following him, but the firearms team still out of position. He entered the tube carriage, and as the armed officers burst in he got up. A surveillance officer called Ivor grabbed him and forced him back into his seat. Wright said the two firearms officers who would kill De Menezes saw this act.</p> <p>He said: \"Both officers state that they were convinced that Mr De Menezes was a suicide bomber, that he was about to detonate a bomb, and that unless he was prevented from doing so, everybody in that carriage was going to die. Each officer says that he was convinced that an instant killing was the only option open to them.\"</p> <p>The hearing continues.</p> <h2>FAQ The hearing</h2> <p><strong>What is the inquest about?</strong></p> <p>The coroner, Sir Michael Wright, told the jury the inquest was a fact-finding investigation into how Jean Charles de Menezes came to be killed. The inquest is not a trial and is not supposed to apportion blame.</p> <p><strong>What are the possible verdicts?</strong></p> <p>The family wants the jury to return a verdict of unlawful killing. That would lead to pressure on the Crown Prosecution Service to reconsider its decision that no individuals should be prosecuted over the shooting. Allies of Sir Ian Blair feel such a verdict could lead to his ousting as commissioner of the Met. Other verdicts include lawful killing and an open verdict.</p> <p><strong>How many witnesses will testify?</strong></p> <p>The inquest will last up to 12 weeks and is due to hear from 75 witnesses. Forty-nine will be police officers involved in the operation that led to the death who have been granted anonymity because revealing their identity would damage their ability to carry out undercover work or, they fear, lead to reprisals from criminals or terrorists.</p> <p><strong>What new facts will this inquest tell us?</strong></p> <p>For the first time the public will hear from the two firearms officers who shot the innocent Brazilian dead, fearing he was a terrorist. The accounts of firearms teams and surveillance officers differ. The inquest will also hear from witnesses in the carriage, none of whom say they heard warnings that the police claim to have shouted. The Met may also explain why the firearms team was in the wrong place for several hours after being ordered to an address it was suspected was being used by terrorists.</p> <h2>A message to the force</h2> <p><strong>Extract from Sir Ian Blair's four-minute video to Metropolitan police staff</strong></p> <p>Something in the region of 65 serving or former officers have been called to give evidence. There will be intense media coverage. As far as the organisation as a whole is concerned, I have asked counsel to represent the Met's position as being this: Jean Charles de Menezes was an entirely innocent man and the Metropolitan police takes full responsibility for his death.</p> <p>Although it happened in the middle of perhaps the most testing operational challenge the service has faced since the second world war, this death has robbed a family of their son. We have to account for that and an inquest is the place to do so ... </p> <p>Our approach will be one of humility. On 22nd July 2005, we confidently believed that our systems of command, of surveillance and of firearms intervention were among the best in the world. However, they failed in response to a previously unforeseen circumstance, suicide bombers on the run. </p> <p>No one set out that day with any intent to let a young man die. The officers involved will be giving evidence of doing what they did with good intention. They have my support and should have yours. Nevertheless, this will be a difficult couple of months and we must brace ourselves for criticism.</p>",
  "<p>The deadly blast in Islamabad was a revenge attack for what has been going on over the past few weeks in the badlands of the North-West Frontier. It highlighted the crisis confronting the new government in the wake of intensified US strikes in the tribal areas on the Afghan border. </p> <p>Hellfire missiles, drones, special operation raids inside Pakistan and the resulting deaths of innocents have fuelled Pashtun nationalism. It is this spillage from the war in Afghanistan that is now destabilising Pakistan. </p> <p>The de facto prime minister of the country, an unelected crony of President Zardari and now his chief adviser, Rehman Malik, said, \"our enemies don't want to see democracy flourishing in the country\". This was rich coming from him, but in reality it has little to do with all that. It is the consequence of a supposedly \"good war\" in Afghanistan that has now gone badly wrong. The director of US National Intelligence, Michael McConnell, admits as much, saying the Afghan leadership must deal with the \"endemic corruption and pervasive poppy cultivation and drug trafficking\" that is to blame for the rise of the neo-Taliban.</p> <p>The majority of Pakistanis are opposed to the US presence in the region, viewing it as the most serious threat to peace. Why, then, has the US decided to destabilise a crucial ally? Within Pakistan, some analysts argue this is a carefully coordinated move to weaken the Pakistani state by creating a crisis that extends way beyond the frontier with Afghanistan. Its ultimate aim, they claim, would be the extraction of the Pakistani military's nuclear fangs. If this were the case, it would imply Washington was determined to break up Pakistan, since the country would not survive a disaster on that scale.</p> <p>In my view, however, the expansion of the war relates far more to the Bush administration's disastrous occupation in Afghanistan. It is hardly a secret that President Karzai's regime is becoming more isolated each passing day, as Taliban guerrillas move ever closer to Kabul.</p> <p>When in doubt, escalate the war, is an old imperial motto. The strikes against Pakistan represent - like the decisions of President Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger, to bomb and then invade Cambodia - a desperate bid to salvage a war that was never good, but has now gone badly wrong.</p> <p>It is true that those resisting the Nato occupation cross the Pakistan-Afghan border with ease. However, the US has often engaged in quiet negotiations with them. Several feelers have been put out to the Taliban in Pakistan, while US intelligence experts regularly check into the Serena hotel in Swat to meet Maulana Fazlullah, a local pro-Taliban leader. </p> <p>Pashtuns in Peshawar, hitherto regarded as secular liberals, told the BBC only last week that they had lost all faith in the west. The decision to violate the country's sovereignty at will had sent them in the direction of the insurgents. </p> <p>While there is much grieving for the Marriott hotel casualties, some ask why the lives of those killed by Predator drones or missile attacks are considered to be of less value. In recent weeks almost 100 innocent people have died in this fashion. No outrage and global media coverage for them.</p> <p>Why was the Marriot targeted? Two explanations have surfaced in the media. The first is that there was a planned dinner for the president and his cabinet there that night, which was cancelled at the last moment. </p> <p>The second, reported in the respected Pakistani English-language newspaper, Dawn, is that \"a top secret operation of the US Marines [was] going on inside the Marriott when it was attacked\". According to the paper: \"Well-equipped security officers from the US embassy were seen on the spot soon after the explosions. However, they left the scene shortly afterwards.\"</p> <p>The country's largest newspaper, the News, also reported on Sunday that witnesses had seen US embassy steel boxes being carried into the Marriott at night on September 17. According to the paper, the steel boxes were permitted to circumvent security scanners stationed at the hotel entrance.</p> <p>Mumtaz Alam, a member of parliament, witnessed this. He wanted to leave the hotel but, owing to the heavy security, he was not permitted to leave at the time and is threatening to raise the issue in parliament. </p> <p>These may be the motivations for this particular attack, but behind it all is the shadow of an expanding war.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Tariq Ali's latest book is The Duel: Pakistan On the Flight Path of American Power </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:tariqali3@btinternet.com\">tariqali3@btinternet.com</a></p>",
  "<p>David Jones, who has died at the age of 74, was an immensely distinguished director in theatre, film and television. Although latterly based in New York, he was a pillar of the Royal Shakespeare Company in a golden decade from 1968 and had a long association with Harold Pinter that led, in 1978, to a memorable BBC Play of the Week, Langrishe, Go Down, and, in 1983, to a film of Betrayal. With his mixture of charm, articulacy and intelligence, Jones was very much an actors' director, as shown by his 2007 production of The Last Confession in Chichester and London, which yielded an unforgettable performance from David Suchet.</p> <p>Jones was born in Poole, Dorset, and educated at Taunton School and Christ's College, Cambridge. He was part of the generation, including Melvyn Bragg and Humphrey Burton, that gravitated towards the BBC Television arts department in its productive heyday.</p> <p>But, although always in love with the camera, Jones had strong leanings towards theatre. In May 1959 he appeared in the first London revival of Pinter's The Birthday Party at the amateur Tower Theatre in Islington. Jones, who was cast as the volatile McCann, once told me that he naively asked the author about the character's background only to be told by Pinter: \"I've no fucking idea. I know everything about McCann after he walks through that door - I know nothing about him on the other side.\" That was to be the start of a long and fruitful friendship.</p> <p>Jones's professional career as a theatre director started at the Mermaid Theatre in 1961 with a typically adventurous triple bill of work by TS Eliot, WB Yeats and Samuel Beckett. But it was the RSC that was to become his natural home. He worked with Peter Brook in 1965 on a public reading of Peter Weiss's documentary-drama, The Investigation. And, on taking over the company in 1968, Trevor Nunn shrewdly put his trust in Jones and allowed him to develop into an excellent director. </p> <p>Given stewardship of the Aldwych Theatre, Jones turned it into a radical powerhouse combining new work by Pinter, Edward Albee, Marguerite Duras, David Mercer and Peter Barnes with revivals of Bertolt Brecht, George Bernard Shaw, Granville Barker, Sean O'Casey and his beloved Maxim Gorky. \"I aim to make this,\" Jones jokingly told me, \"the Royal Gorky Company.\"</p> <p>Between 1971 and 1976 he directed not just The Lower Depths, but such little-known works as Enemies, Summerfolk and The Zykovs. It was partly because Jones wanted to question Chekhov's theatrical dominance and partly because he believed the underrated Gorky offered a vivid panorama of Russian social and political life.</p> <p>But, of all Jones's Gorky productions, his 1974 Enemies was the masterpiece. He was blessed with an cast including John Wood, Helen Mirren, Alan Howard, Patrick Stewart and Ben Kingsley. But Jones also staged the play with phenomenal flair. There was a moment when a factory-owner, shot at by strikers, was laid out on a table, thereby sending samovars and plates, flying that brilliantly captured the volatility of Russian life.</p> <p>Pinter was Jones's other great passion. In 1978 he directed Pinter's adaptation of Langrishe, Go Down, based on a novel by Aidan Higgins, as a BBC2 Play of the Week. Starring Judi Dench and Jeremy Irons, it was a beautiful, lyrical film about a summer-long affair between a reticent Irish girl and a mature Bavarian student. It was also, as Jones shrewdly remarked, \"a love letter to Harold's own time in Ireland\". In 1973 Jones went on to make that classic film of Pinter's Betrayal, again with Irons, Kingsley and Patricia Hodge, that actually enhanced the work's painful exploration of interlocking infidelities.</p> <p>On stage, Jones also directed Old Times, The Hothouse and, at New York's Roundabout Theatre, a hit version of No Man's Land, starring Jason Robards Jr and Christopher Plummer, as well as The Caretaker. With Old Times in 1985, Jones found himself directing Pinter, who had taken over the role of Deeley from Michael Gambon for an American tour. Jones recalled how Liv Ullmann, who was also in the cast, looked on in astonishment as he and Pinter would probe the author's exact intention as if he were some invisible third party. The Jones-Pinter partnership was renewed for a film version of The Trial (1993), which scrupulously located Kafka's fable in a world of quotidian reality.</p> <p>Jones made several other feature films, including in 1987 a strikingly successful version of 84 Charing Cross Road, starring Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins.</p> <p>And having worked periodically in America - including a two-year spell as director of the BAM (Brooklyn Academy of Music) Theater Company, where he tried to set up a permanent theatre company in Brooklyn - Jones eventually moved to the States. He worked regularly in television on prestige series such as Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (1999), made highly praised features for Home Box Office and sporadically returned to the theatre. But he will be remembered best in Britain for his superb work at the RSC, for that influential reclamation of Gorky and for his profound understanding of Pinter.</p> <p>He was divorced from the actor Sheila Allen. His partner of the last 20 years was the photographer Joyce Tenneson. From his marriage David had two sons, Jesse and Joe, and three grandchildren, whom he loved very much. Joyce's son Alex and his four children were a hugely important part of his life.</p> <p><strong>Melvyn Bragg writes: </strong>David Jones was one of the constellation of arts programme makers brought together by Huw Wheldon for BBC's Monitor programme in the late 1950s. Others included Ken Russell, Humphrey Burton, Patrick Garland and Nancy Thomas. </p> <p>David's was the most elegant mind on the programme, in my view, and I observed him close-up when he followed Burton as editor and I worked directly to him. His artistic integrity was absolute. His taste seems to me to have been perfect. He worked very early on with then budding Harold Pinter, both as an actor and director, as well as bringing him into the Monitor studios for an influential interview.</p> <p>He gained very rare access to EM Forster and, an even more difficult man, RS Thomas. The bleakness of Thomas's vision could seem at odds with David's ironic nature but his virtue, and singularity, was that he could, and did, yoke together such extremes. </p> <p>He made a fine film with Lawrence Durrell in 1960 and Frank O'Connor in 1961 and then, forever tugged by the theatre, switched to the Berliner Ensemble as a subject. A couple of years into his editorship of Monitor, Peter Hall poached him for the RSC. </p> <p>David's idea of a holiday was to direct and act in plays. His reading of great literature was wide, thorough and impressive. I met him at a time when he and his then wife, Sheila, seemed, for me, to epitomise everything that was fine about comparatively plain living and high thinking, even in a metropolis bubbling with temptations to serve mere fashion. </p> <p>David never backed down on any argument about quality of work being done. He was a great appreciator of the best work, on the best subjects, and he himself contributed significantly to that store. He was truly loved by the people who worked with him on Monitor. The RSC's gain then, was arts television's loss.</p> <p><strong>Hugh Whitemore writes:</strong> David Jones had the deepest voice I've ever known. A marvellous subterranean rumble. For the last 20 years he had made his home in New York with Joyce Tenneson and would stay with us whenever he came to London. That familiar rumble from the spare room was the unmistakeable reminder that David was here. He was a truly civilised man. He relished poetry and loved music, of all sorts. He was a man who appreciated excellence, in the theatre, in wine and in conversation. He was a man of delightful habit. He would sit at our kitchen table every evening, sipping his fastidiously mixed martini and describing the art exhibition he had visited or the old friend he had lunched with. His friendship is irreplaceable.</p> <p>His work reflected his very idio-syncratic tastes and enthusiasms. He excelled in the plays of Gorky and Granville Barker; in the work of his friends David Mercer, Richard Nelson and Harold Pinter; David's production of The Hothouse was, in my view, one of the very best of all Pinter interpretations. And I remember Mercer's admiration for the production of The Governor's Lady, which David did for the RSC. His work in television was exceptional, beginning with Huw Wheldon's much admired Monitor and culminating on the BBC's Play of the Month.</p> <p>Among his feature films I consider Jacknife (1989), with Robert De Niro as a Vietnam veteran, shamefully underrated. As for Langrishe, Go Down, his finest work, it approaches perfection.</p> <p>I worked with David only once: on the movie version of 84 Charing Cross Road, for which I wrote the screenplay. We wanted Anne Bancroft, as Helen Hanff, to speak words in memory of a great friend who had died. David chose a passage from John Donne. I now do the same for him: </p> <p>\"All mankinde is of one Author, and is in one volume; when one Man dies, one Chapter is not torne out of the book, but translated into a better language; and every Chapter must be so translated; God emploies several translators; some peeces are translated by age, some by sicknesse, some by warre, some by justice; but Gods hand is in every translation; and his hand shall binde up all our scattered leaves againe, for that Librarie where every booke shall lie open to one another.\"</p> <p>He and Joyce had enjoyed a happy evening with friends. Later that night, he died in his sleep.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> David Hugh Jones, director, born February 19 1934; died September 19 2008</p>",
  "<p>Script structure creates a strong narrative framework that delivers your theme through the interaction of the story world, characters and events. It shapes audiences' experience of your story. Poor structure - or lack of a discernible structure - is the commonest weakness in scripts.<br><strong><br>Three-act structure/Hero's journey/ 7 &amp; 22 steps<br></strong><br>Mainstream western cinema and television are dominated by three-act structure. This is a conflict-driven model, aligning audiences with the point of view of a protagonist who makes decisions and takes action to resolve a series of crises. Sequences are constructed in chains of cause and effect, progressively raising the stakes. Structural models such as the hero's journey (Christopher Vogler, following Joseph Campbell), and the 7 &amp; 22 steps (John Truby) follow similar causal, goal-directed, conflict-based pathways.</p> <p><strong>Alternative models</strong></p> <p>The western independent sector and many national cinemas prefer more open structural models. These models use contrasting features: multiple protagonists and multiple plots; passive or powerless protagonists; no point of view alignment with the protagonist; narration; events linked by coincidence (such as time or location); an order of events that can be rearranged; ending, instead of resolution; the structure prevents audiences from empathy with characters. Examples of films using these kinds of structures would be Dogville, Intacto, and Magnolia.</p> <p>Plays frequently choose less plot-driven alternatives, exploiting non-naturalistic devices and theatrical possibilities. Structures can be circular (Waiting for Godot); episodic (Top Girls); employ parallel action, echoes and associational links. Tom Stoppard (Arcadia, Rock 'n' Roll), Michael Frayn (Copenhagen, Democracy) and Caryl Churchill (Far Away; Heart's Desire)all use open structures. </p> <p><strong>Working with structure</strong></p> <p>Look at your theme, characters and story. </p> <p>- Is your theme best delivered through a single, goal-driven protagonist whose decisions and actions create change within himself and his world? (A)</p> <p>- Does your theme address the effects of the story world upon one or more protagonists, whose actions cannot effect change internally or externally? (B)</p> <p>- Should we be closely aligned with the protagonist's viewpoint? (A)</p> <p>- Should we reflect on the characters' situations and actions, but not identify with them? (B)</p> <p>Look at your story events in relation to your theme, characters and story world:</p> <p>- Can you identify an event that would trigger a chain of cause and effect? An event that would finally resolve the chain? (A)</p> <p>- Would these events, arranged into causal chains, support a main plot driven by the protagonist's decisions? (A) </p> <p>- Are these events driven primarily by characters' decisions? (A)</p> <p>- Are your events linked by time, location, characters or theme, not by cause and effect? (B)</p> <p>- Would these events support multiple, smaller plots of equal importance? (B)</p> <p>- Are these events driven primarily by factors outside characters' control? (B)</p> <p>Mostly (A) answers could suggest using three- act structure, or the hero's journey, or the 7 &amp; 22 steps. Mostly (B) answers could suggest alternative models.</p> <p><strong>Plotting </strong></p> <p>Structure organises the strategic release of narrative information. Many decisions will concern questions of knowledge:</p> <p>- What does the audience) already know?</p> <p>- What does each character already know? </p> <p>- To whom is each piece of information revealed? (Irony occurs when we know more than the characters.)</p> <p>- How and when is it revealed?</p> <p>Causal plots (A) are structured around obstacles, turning points and reversals. The trigger provokes the protagonist to formulate a goal, and to take steps to achieve it. Each step confronts him with a new obstacle to overcome. Each decision generates a turning point that takes the story in a new direction. Some turning points help him progress; others produce setbacks and reversals.</p> <p>In three-act structure, each act pivots around a major turning point: act one's turning point comes from external events;. act two's turning point comes from an internal shift inside the protagonist; act three's turning point comes from the protagonist's final decisive action, and brings about the resolution. </p> <p>Construct your scenes and sequences using this pattern: establish a situation, then disrupt it. Use turning points and reversals to provoke actions and reactions. </p> <p>Alternative (B) structures still require conflict, obstacles, turning points and reversals. The protagonist still makes decisions, but plot progression is driven externally. There may not be plot progression; the story describes the world and the characters, rather than engaging them in action. In (B) structures, turning points move us between parallel stories, or loop us backwards and forwards between episodes in the story. In both (A) and (B) structures, try to build in echoes: images, sounds or lines that recur in different contexts; information that recurs in different ways. This process of foreshadowing operates as a form of prediction in (A) structures; in (B) structures, it binds together different threads of story, and carries your theme. </p> <h2>Exercise: building a structure</h2> <p>Make at least four selections from each of the following lists of locations, characters and events, and work out the structure of a five-minute story. </p> <p><strong>Exterior:</strong> front doorstep; traffic intersection; garden.</p> <p><strong>Interior:</strong> bus; kitchen; department store display window.</p> <p><strong>Characters:</strong> cleaner; bus passenger; shop assistant; grandparent; school student; window-shopper.</p> <p><strong>Events:</strong> a text message is sent or received; a photograph is taken; a wallet is lost; a breakage occurs; a slap; a kiss.</p>",
  "<p>Who should be leading our schools? I ask the question because it seems that Messrs Balls and Co just can't decide how they want schools to be governed.</p> <p>Last week's announcement by the schools secretary that he is looking for 100 schools to become co-operative trusts would put the control of a school back with those most closely connected to it - parents, staff, teachers and members of the local community.</p> <p>On the same day, the education department trumpeted the opening of 47 privately sponsored new academies - schools outside of local authority control and governed largely by representatives appointed by their sponsors.</p> <p>The two types of schools use very different methods of governance - co-ops are run by their \"customers\" while academies are run by their \"investors\" and neither, I maintain, are totally effective.</p> <p>Take the co-operative model. Ed Balls said: \"This is about putting power in the hands of those who are directly engaged with local schools, and who know best what is needed in their area.\"</p> <p>The schools minister Andrew Adonis (yes, the champion of academies) added: \"I urge other schools to look to this style of governance to put power in the hands of the people they serve.\"</p> <p>So, power to the people, what's wrong with that? The problem is that if all power is devolved to those who use the school - parents whose children attend it, staff who are paid to work there, etc - then no one on the governing body takes a dispassionate, bigger-picture view about how it is run and what it is achieving. Schools need representatives from other educational establishments, the world of business and the wider community to give context and balance to the issues they face so they don't get bogged down in detail and isolated.</p> <p>At the other end of the scale, academies are transforming schools into businesses. Sponsors ploughing millions into new buildings and equipment demand a \"return on investment\". They have got to be assured that the way a school is run protects their investment, their ethos, and their reputation, so they will appoint \"key governors\" to make sure that this happens, sometimes squeezing out the voices of parents and staff in the process.</p> <p>The middle way is the stakeholder model of governance, which runs on the principle that no one stakeholder group is more important or has more value than any other. All governors are equal members of the corporate body, even though some may have vested interests.</p> <p>To put it into a business context, schools should have some governors who are like the non-executive board members of companies, chosen for their experience, knowledge and, importantly, their independence from the management. </p> <p>In 1992, the Cadbury report said that non-executive directors \"should bring an independent judgment to bear on issues of strategy, performance and resources, including key appointments and standards of conduct\".</p> <p>Ministers should be trying to ensure that all schools, particularly co-ops and academies, preserve this element of independent scrutiny if they really want them to be well governed.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"mailto:Education.governor@theguardian.com\">Education.governor@theguardian.com</a> </p>",
  "<p>There could be as many as 30m fake \u00a31 coins in circulation thanks to a boom in counterfeiting, it emerged yesterday.</p> <p>A sampling test by the Royal Mint showed the number of counterfeit coins appears to have doubled in the last five years, suggesting that one in every 50 \u00a31 coins is not the genuine article. When the last test was conducted in 2003, the proportion of forged coins was put at 1%.</p> <p>Although the Royal Mint said the forgery represented \"a comparatively low incidence of counterfeit coins by international monetary standards\", some experts disagreed.</p> <p>Robert Matthews, the Queen's assay master at the mint until he retired to become a coin consultant four years ago, said confidence in coins had collapsed in other countries when forgery rates reached similar levels. \"In 2004, people started refusing to take the South African five-rand coin due to concerns about the number of counterfeits, and eventually the coin had to be redesigned and recirculated,\" he told the BBC.</p> <p>\"Independent surveys showed the number of counterfeits to be 2% - the same as we've got here - and I'm worried that if we're not careful the same thing will happen to the pound coin.\"</p> <p>The euro coin seems to be more forgery-proof. Two years ago, it was estimated that only around 0.1% of the 13bn coins in circulation - 50c, \u20ac1 and \u20ac2 - were fakes. </p> <p>In a statement, the Royal Mint said: \"We track the counterfeit rate through regular surveys in the spring and autumn every year. The survey consists of taking a random sample of coins from across the country, and subjecting them to individual analytical inspection.</p> <p>\"It is a criminal offence to make or use counterfeited coins. Any member of the public who suspects that they have a counterfeited coin should not attempt to spend it.\"</p> <p>The first \u00a31 coin was issued on April 21 1983. Over the last quarter of a century, the designs on the backs of the coins have featured, among other things, thistles, leeks, flax plants, oak trees, lions rampant, dragons passant, Celtic crosses and the Gateshead Millennium bridge. At the end of December 2005, the Royal Mint estimated that there were 1,452m \u00a31 coins in circulation.</p> <h2>How to spot them</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Check the edge of the coin for lettering that looks messy or is in the wrong typeface. Milled edges should be clearly defined.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Authentic coins change colour over time, but counterfeit coins are sometimes very obviously the wrong colour.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Make sure the Queen's head and the design on the back are upright, centred and face in the same direction.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Most vending machines will reject counterfeit coins.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> The date on the coin should correspond with its design according to a list available from the Royal Mint website at <a href=\"http://www.royalmint.gov.uk\">royalmint.gov.uk</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Big City firms which encourage traders to take too many risks to win their annual multimillion pound bonuses could face stiff penalties from the Financial Services Authority.</p> <p>The City regulator could demand financial firms put aside a bigger capital cushion if their pay schemes incentivise traders to take short-term risks that could backfire in the longer term. </p> <p>Bonuses are paid annually, sometimes before it is clear whether traders' bets have paid off or proved disastrous. Trading losses have contributed to the demise of leading firms such as Lehman Brothers, mired in controversy as its Wall Street staff seem likely to receive their bonuses after being taking over by Barclays.</p> <p>Chancellor Alistair Darling yesterday put the onus on the FSA to tackle \"the culture of huge bonuses\" in the City.</p> <p>\"It's essential that bonuses don't result in people being encouraged to take on more and more risk without understanding the damage that might be done, not just to their bank but to the rest of us in the wider economy,\" Darling told the Labour conference. </p> <p>The authority has begun scrutinising bonus policies during its regulatory visits. But the unions yesterday called on the chancellor to take direct action through taxation. Derek Simpson, leader of Unite, spoke of a \"powerful mega elite with no connection to ordinary people, an amoral class without a care for how their reckless behaviour is now wrecking lives. If you can't regulate the bonus culture, then tax it out of existence.\"</p> <p>The FSA does not intend to regulate individual bonuses, but pay deals will be analysed as part of the risk assessments of firms it regulates. A spokeswomen said: \"What might happen if we don't like [what we find]? If we believe the pay deal creates additional risks, we could make a requirement to put more capital aside.\"</p> <p>Hector Sants, the FSA's chief executive, has been warning City firms since the spring that the regulator is playing close attention to the way they pay their staff. </p> <p>But Peter Hahn, banking specialist at the Cass business school, warned against scrutiny of the bonus pool, and instead urged the FSA to focus on senior executives. \"If the top five people are paid the right way, so will the rest of the organisation. If the chief executive isn't incentivised for traders to take risk, the traders won't take risks,\" said Hahn.</p> <p>In the US, the debate is also raging. John McCain has unexpectedly backed calls by Democrats for a cap on executive pay at struggling banks. Citing large salaries at Lehman as an example of unacceptable conduct, he suggested institutions benefiting from a bail-out by taxpayers should have their salaries capped at $400,000. </p> <p>\"No CEO of any corporation or business that is bailed out by us, that is rescued by American tax dollars, should receive any more than the highest-paid person in the federal government,\" the Republican presidential candidate told CNBC. The highest paid individual in the US government is George Bush, who earns $400,000.</p> <p>The Democrats are fighting to insert a pay cap in legislation for the treasury's $700bn fund to buy up banks' distressed securities. They argue that huge pay linked to profits created perverse incentives for bankers to take bigger short-term risks. </p> <p>But treasury secretary Hank Paulson is resisting these efforts, seeing them as a sideshow which could delay the bill. </p> <p>\"There have been excesses. I agree with the American people - pay should be for performance, not for failure,\" said Paulson; but the bail-out urgently needed to be passed in simple form and remuneration reforms should come \"afterwards\".</p> <h2>AIG boss forgoes payoff</h2> <p><strong>Robert Willumstad</strong>, the outgoing head of the stricken insurance company <strong>AIG</strong>, has voluntarily <strong>forfeited</strong> a <strong>$22m (\u00a312m) </strong>severance package after being in effect sacked from his job as part of a bail-out by the US treasury. AIG's board decided that he <strong>was entitled </strong>to the money under his contract, which was drafted in generous terms just three months ago. But in an email to his successor, Edward Liddy, he wrote: \"I prefer not to receive severance while shareholders and employees have <strong>lost considerable value </strong>in their AIG shares.\" AIG was kept afloat last week through an <strong>$85bn</strong> US treasury loan; the government will take an 80% stake in AIG in return.</p>",
  "<p>Alisher Usmanov will step aside and allow Stan Kroenke to take over Arsenal without a fight once the current shareholder-directors decide to sell up.</p> <p>Both suspect that Danny Fiszman, the most powerful individual on the Arsenal board, is setting up an auction for the day when he cashes in on his 24.11% stake. But Usmanov would prefer to be a sleeping investor rather than fight Kroenke for the club. Kroenke's relationship with the Arsenal board is clearly better developed than Usmanov's, as evidenced by the American's co-option as a director last Friday. Yet Usmanov, with a \u00a3100m-plus investment in the club, is the largest single shareholder and he continues to pay \u00a38,700 for individual shares as they appear on the market.</p> <p>His motives for doing so, however, have switched from a desire for control to the belief that even at their current \u00a3870m debt-plus-equity value Arsenal are underpriced. The shift in emphasis may also explain the departure of David Dein as chairman of Usmanov's investment vehicle, Red &amp; White Holdings. The former vice-chairman has made no secret of his desire to return to the Emirates stadium but Usmanov will not deliver him that route.</p> <p>The well-connected Dein remains wedded to the belief that Arsenal can survive in the Premier League only with a billionaire investor. With Kroenke expected to fund any acquisition through loans loaded on the club, the prospect of Dein delivering an even wealthier third-party investor should not be ruled out.</p> <h2>Sky hit by Faldo's tactics</h2> <p>Sky Sports showed 14 fewer commercial breaks than the American host broadcaster, NBC, at the Ryder Cup over the weekend. But the satellite channel's decision to front-load its ad breaks during the final-day singles matches in order to show more golf at the climax of play backfired. With Europe's team captain, Nick Faldo, having made a hash of his picks, the match was all over before the box-office names of Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood and the back-to-back Open champion, Padraig Harrington, had reached the 18th green.</p> <h2>Davis Cup exit not so dear</h2> <p>Britain's Davis Cup defeat to Austria means the Lawn Tennis Association will miss out on a greater share of the tournament's $9m (\u00a34.8m) in prize money but in all likelihood the failure to progress will not cost British tennis anything in financial terms. The size of the crowd is unlikely to be affected whether Great Britain are in the elite world group or the lower zonal group. Although Austria's win was worth $28,000 more than the LTA's prize of $64,000, the cost of staging the tie means the LTA expects to have made a net loss. Early estimates from the sale of 9,200 pre-booked premium-price tickets for last Friday's action and a further 7,300 for Sunday suggest gate receipts of more than \u00a3500,000. But that does not cover the cost of hiring and stewarding Wimbledon's Court One. The financial services group Aegon may be less sanguine. It committed to a \u00a325m title sponsorship of the LTA last week and begins the five-year deal with Britain once again outside the Davis Cup world group.</p> <h2>Jobs for the boys?</h2> <p>The feeling that Seb Coe's hand is on the shoulder of UK Athletics will only be strengthened if Daley Thompson, below, joins the governing body in a coaching capacity. The double Olympic decathlon champion was once an athlete mentor for UKA but his relationship with the former performance director, Dave Collins, was summed up in a Radio 5 interview yesterday: \"I don't think Collins knew a lot about performance.\" It is only now that Charles van Commenee is about to replace Collins - he will be appointed today after the latter was sacked following British athletics' poor showing in Beijing - that Thompson is prepared to become involved again. Lord Coe was influential in Van Commenee's decision to join UKA and Thompson is Coe's best mate. Jobs for the (admittedly very well-qualified) boys perhaps?</p>",

  "<p>So what does the new principal of one of Britain's leading conservatoires slip on to the CD player when he relaxes at home after a busy day at the office? A late Beethoven quartet? A dash of Ad\u00e8s? A Bach partita? All three probably have their place in the Jonty Stockdale record collection.</p> <p>But the music he says is grabbing his attention at present is made by Farmers Market, a Norwegian group that melds cool jazz with the sounds, and sometimes complex rhythms, of Bulgaria.</p> <p>The albums are worth the money for the track titles alone: Anyone Who Remembers Vladiwoodstock Wasn't There; To Hell And Baku; Ladyboy's Night At The Agricultural Workers' Saloon. The music isn't bad either.</p> <p><strong>Unconventional</strong></p> <p>Stockdale, just starting his first term as head of the Royal Northern College Of Music in Manchester, has a passion for jazz and electro-acoustic music. But he is careful to suggest that his musical enthusiasms and unconventional background should not strike terror into the hearts of RNCM staff who have helped generations of students, including the pianists Peter Donohoe and Stephen Hough and the singers Jane Eaglen and Amanda Roocroft, into careers remote from improvised jazz with a Balkan twist.</p> <p>\"I don't know what the norm is for someone who leads an institution like this,\" says Stockdale. \"There's a tendency to look at someone's background and associate that with what they want to do. For me, there is a clear division between the kind of musical interests and pursuits that I have and my leadership and management role.\"</p> <p>Stockdale, 46, grew up in Doncaster. He went to a primary school where every child learned an instrument and where music was \"a natural part of the landscape\". He moved on to a grammar school where he had \"powerful musical experiences\" and passed his grade eight exams not just in clarinet, his first instrument, but also in flute and piano.</p> <p>At 13 or 14, he heard the Doncaster Youth Jazz Orchestra, of which he was soon to become an enthusiastic member, adding saxophone to his instrument list. \"Hearing that orchestra was the first time I had that experience of a tingle going down my spine, and I just had to be involved in it.\"</p> <p>He went on to study music at Huddersfield, home of the famed festival of contemporary music. \"Huddersfield was life-changing. I went with a clarinet in my hand because I thought that was what I was going to be doing. But within the first term we were all required to write a string quartet. I'd never really sat down and composed anything.</p> <p>\"It was absolutely the right place for me and the festival opened up a world I had never experienced.\"</p> <p>Stockdale began working in the university's electro-acoustic music studio and, as he describes it, began playing with sound. \"When you have a sound in your head and know that you cannot write it for an instrument, you have this opportunity to manipulate sound and even to question what sound is. I was like a sponge, just sucking things up.\"</p> <p>He helped out at the festival and once had tea with the modernist composer Iannis Xenakis, who said quite a lot about the weather and rather less about music.</p> <p>After a PhD at York and work on using computers to create sound, Stockdale joined Salford College, now absorbed into Salford University, as a lecturer: the attraction was an electronic studio.</p> <p>After two years, he launched, with a colleague, a degree course in popular music, the first of its kind in Britain. Soon the course's 30 places were attracting 1,500 applications from \"some of the most academically gifted students I have ever encountered\".</p> <p>By this stage, he was moving into educational management and eventually moved to Leeds College of Music, partly to re-engage with his passion for jazz. There he became director of studies, with a growing interest in how music could collaborate with other art forms, a fascination that led him to a post as head of music at the Victoria College of Arts in Melbourne. He thought his future was in Australia.</p> <p>But then came the RNCM job after fewer than three years down under.</p> <p><strong>Broad church</strong></p> <p>Stockdale describes his background as \"diverse\". That is not so unusual now, he says, and offers some reassurance to the wary. \"My job is not to come in with grand ideas and gestures but to capitalise on what we have here and get the best out of it. The RNCM is a broad church. I am not about switching things off in order to switch other things on. I wouldn't have come here if that had been my intention because it would have been so against the grain of the institution.\"</p> <p>The RNCM, he adds, has its great tradition of investment in the western classical canon. It has orchestras and ensembles of every kind; stages operas in its own theatre; runs an annual intensive chamber music festival.</p> <p>\"But the college is much more than that, and rather than me coming here to see an institution that needs to be changed, I find that a lot of the things I would want to do are already happening. So it's a question of encouraging them to happen in different ways.</p> <p>\"The college supports jazz. Students cannot come here principally to study jazz and improvised music, but the RNCM recognises that it's an art form students want to pursue. The infrastructure is there and dedicated staff support those students.</p> <p>\"The college has already taken the step. There is no question about whether this is a legitimate thing for the RNCM to do. It's already doing it. The question then is how we do it and how well we do it. That's what I'm interested in.\"</p> <p>The college does not have its own electronic music studio (students have access to one down the road at Manchester University) but it does have recording studios. Stockdale wants his 700 or so young musicians to make use of them, to realise that most of their professional work is likely to be disseminated through recordings, especially on the net. \"Musicians who are not aware of this are, I think, at a severe disadvantage in terms of it being an important part of how they will work.\"</p> <p>Stockdale's reassurances - that he comes to Manchester primarily as an experienced education manager - continue. But it's clear that the next few years on Oxford Road are going to be interesting if he attempts to close the gap between the RNCM's teaching and curriculum and the adventurous programmes (the most exciting in Manchester) presented in the college's concert hall and recital room.</p> <p>\"The RNCM is an innovative, dynamic institution. From the outside, some may see it for what they want to see. But we have to take labels like conservatoire and redefine them. The RNCM is in the vanguard in some respects but not in others, and we have to be realistic about that.</p> <p>\"I have been fortunate enough to visit conservatoires around the world. Some are very cutting edge indeed. They are upholding the great traditions but they are also allowing jazz, improvised music and popular music to develop in the same institution.

  "<p>A man arrested over the shooting of a businessman and his wife at their remote Cornish home broke up with the couple's daughter just a few weeks before the attack, it was claimed yesterday. </p> <p>Relatives of Adam Hustler, who was shot dead, and his wife, Amanda, who suffered gunshot wounds to her back but survived, said their daughter, Danielle, had ended the relationship. </p> <p>Police are still waiting to interview Jonathan Cock, 23, who suffered self-inflicted facial wounds in the incident on Saturday night, in connection with the attack. </p> <p>Mr Hustler's grandfather, Harry Roberts, 87, said a relationship between Cock, a farmer's son, and Danielle, who is thought to be 20 and is believed to have witnessed the shooting, ended about two months ago. </p> <p>Roberts said: \"She packed him up. They'd been together for about a year.\"</p> <p>The shooting took place at the Hustlers' \u00a3500,000 home in the hamlet of Porth Kea, near Truro in south Cornwall. A .22 rifle is understood to have been used. Cock was later arrested by armed police at his family's home on remote moorland near Land's End. </p> <p>Roberts said Cock had worked for Adam Hustler's drain clearing company. Neighbours of Cock claimed that his family, like the Hustlers, were Jehovah's Witnesses. The family was in shock, Roberts added. \"The family have taken the news terribly,\" he said. \"I was like a zombie, walking around. We're a very close-knit family.\"</p> <p>Roberts, a retired steel manufacturer, added: \"Danielle has taken things terribly. The police were grilling her for four hours.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Adam lived with me for a year from when he was five years old to six years old. He was a son to me.\" </p> <p>Mr Hustler's mother, Maureen, 64, said: \"You can't understand how devastated and heartbroken a mother is to lose a son, a first-born son. </p> <p>\"That's all I can say - Adam was a wonderful son, he was a special part of our warm, loving family. We just can't express the pain that we're going through at this time.\"</p> <p>It also emerged yesterday that Mrs Hustler underwent an operation but refused a blood transfusion because of her faith. </p> <p>Tim Mears, a family friend and a spokesman for the Jehovah's Witnesses in Cornwall, said: \"A blood transfusion is her decision about her body. As a Jehovah's Witness it's a personal stand. She was conscious before the operation and was able to make that choice.\" She was said to be in a \"stable\" condition last night. </p> <p>Mears said he had spoken to Danielle. He said: \"She was very distressed but coping. She has been through the terrible trauma of watching what happened to her parents. </p> <p>\"It is likely the full psychological effects will come out later. I understand she saw it all and I think her sister was at the house as well.</p> <p>\"I met her boyfriend, Jonathan Cock, on a couple of occasions when they were going out and he seemed a very nice young man. I have no reason to believe her family's religious beliefs had anything to do with what has happened.\" </p> <p>Yesterday Cock's home was being guarded by police. Members of his family run a centre for adults with learning difficulties. </p> <p>Superintendent Michelle Slevin, of Devon and Cornwall police, said: \"Searches are continuing to locate any weapon or weapons used and forensic examinations of a number of scenes are taking place.</p> <p>\"We can confirm one man was arrested on suspicion of murder and is currently in police custody. He has not yet been interviewed. We are not looking for anyone else in connection to the incident.\"</p>",
  "<p>Today Gordon Brown makes his big speech. He has given better platform performances this week and his party will be willing him to do well. But this will not seal his fate either way. Banks falling from the sky have commanded strict loyalty to the leader from all lips - in public, but not privately. Good handling of financial storms might still shift his fortunes, but latest polls suggest not. </p> <p>Is there anything he could do now? \"I will try my utmost,\" he said again this week, repeating his school motto. But people have lost patience with his personal efforts. Try to do what? That is the question he has failed to answer so far, and will try to today.</p> <p>Try this thought experiment. Ask what you would do if you could run the country with a large majority for 18 months? Looking at likely annihilation, Labour could seize these last days to do all it has failed to do, make good broken promises, undo errors and dare to ignore all focus groups and media. There is little to lose, and that brings its own liberation. Do whatever feels right, for its own sake regardless, and lessen regrets that will dog Labour for a decade to come. </p> <p>The paradox is that behaving as if wipeout is inevitable could be the one way to save the day. A reckless spirit of doing Labour things because Labour believes in them may be the one chance to recapture the public imagination. The days of Labour tiptoeing across a shiny floor afraid of dropping a Ming vase are over: at 20 points behind in the polls, there is nothing left to break. Let other parties scheme and calculate: those on death row no longer need to.</p> <p>Start with political reform. Declare with honesty that begging for money from eccentric and often corrupt rich donors is a blight on all parties that has caused dangerous political distrust and cynicism. Apologise and bring in state financing, parties raising nothing extra beyond ordinary membership subscriptions - including trade union funds. It's a cheap price to pay for probity.</p> <p>In the wilderness, Labour will regret most that it never secured a fair voting system. Abandoning a deal with the Lib Dems in the hubris of success was not just shortsighted for Labour, it was a tragedy for future good government. So bring in proportional representation right away, ignore howls of protest from the Tories and reform the Lords in the same bill.</p> <p>Feeling recklessly brave? Restore the media ownership laws as they were before Margaret Thatcher let Murdoch destroy them. The US is tougher on how much one owner can control. Ban foreign media ownership and make the Press Complaints Commission and its code statutory.</p> <p>Abandon everything expensive, unpopular and irrelevant to Labour's message. Why let ID cards and 42-day detention without trial make enemies of people who should be Labour friends? Plenty of serious defence and foreign policy analysts regard two aircraft carriers and the replacement of Trident as expensive irrelevancies. If that seems too dangerously like bad old Labour, hold a referendum to see if people would rather spend on better things. </p> <p>Devote Labour's last 18 months to children. An annual report in parliament measuring children's wellbeing and child poverty should become a legal obligation, answering the shaming UN report that put Britain near the bottom for children's happiness. Just as future governments will have to report on reducing carbon emissions, measuring children's wellbeing would mean better mental health, family support and not locking up children in trouble. </p> <p>A children's declaration would help Labour regain the recognition it deserves as the best government ever for children, recalled at conference meetings here time and again, as people talk of their local Sure Start and the move to extend nursery schooling to two-year-olds. If Labour's under-fives programme has filled in a great missing part of the welfare state, the new deal for 14- to 18-year-olds deserves the same accolade. It's almost impossible to get media attention for children not destined for A-levels, but at last vocational diplomas and apprenticeships for all who want them gives every child a chance. The Tories are contemptuous, as well as sneering about sending more young people to university. It's excellent that Brown will announce today broadband access for all children at home, but Labour needs to cement children's priorities into the political process.</p> <p>Inequality is a word once banned from New Labour's lexicon, but not now. Both Miliband brothers used it boldly, speaking of the need to narrow the widening gap. The call for taxing the rich to ease tax on the low paid resounded almost universally through the conference meeting rooms (except among the Hutton/Flint/Purnell ultras). The urgent need to rebalance a tax system grown grossly unfair was on all lips here. Time to stop the many paying more tax than the rich few. That's what Labour is for. That call has become the totemic issue for most people here - but Brown will not relent, which makes it all the odder that the left and the unions are his great defenders.</p> <p>What else? Get tougher on non-doms. No one understands how people born, bred and living here can avoid paying British tax. Peg the minimum wage to earnings plus 1%, so the low paid keep advancing instead of falling behind as in the past two years. Make union recognition easy: inequality soared once most of the low paid lost any organisation. Create a high pay commission, as the Work Foundation suggests, to say when enough greed is enough, as part of new regulation of banking and the City. Don't take fright at every idle threat that wealth will flee.</p> <p>No one could point to swing-voter focus groups, who would applaud all this in advance. The enemy media would proclaim it all outrageously, dangerously Soviet. But none of this is extreme, and all of it benefits middle Britain. Possibly, just possibly, the sheer sincerity of doing what you really believe is worth trying. Apologising, telling the truth and ignoring the media might just regain public respect. </p> <p>If it fails, nothing much is lost in the present climate - and some satisfying good is done. Why waste this time? It is unthinkable that Brown could ever throw caution to the winds - but this week other contenders looked as if they could have the optimism and bravery to capture a dash of this. Act as if all is lost, and all may still be won.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong have already banned or recalled a variety of milk products. Taiwan banned all mainland dairy products on Sunday. In Hong Kong Nestl\u00e9, the world's largest food company, said it had recalled a UHT pure milk product after a local food watchdog discovered samples containing a tiny amount of the chemical melamine. </p> <p>Worried Hong Kong parents also took their children for health checks, after the government announced that a three-year-old girl who had drunk a melamine-laced milk product had a kidney stone. She did not show serious symptoms and was discharged without medication or surgery.</p> <p>The Japanese government has asked 90,000 companies to check whether imports have been contaminated with melamine, and the country's Marudai Food Co has withdrawn buns made with milk supplied by one of the Chinese companies involved, Yili Industrial Group. </p> <p>In China anxious parents are queueing at hospitals to have their babies examined. The government has promised free treatment, but some families are concerned about costs and long-term complications. </p> <p>Four infants are believed to have died from the toxic formula and 104 are in serious condition, the health ministry said. It added that 1,500 had already left hospital and nearly 40,000 with milder symptoms had received clinical treatment and advice before going home. The ministry had previously reported that 6,200 children were ill, with 1,300 in hospital. It did not explain the sharp rise in numbers.</p> <p>The head of China's quality watchdog, Li Changjiang, stepped down with the approval of the cabinet, the state news agency Xinhua reported. His agency is responsible for ensuring that China's food supply chain is safe. </p> <p>Premier Wen Jiabao threatened harsh punishment for culprits as he toured hospitals in Beijing. \"Although the ordinary people are very understanding, as the government we feel very guilty,\" he said, according to Xinhua. \"This event is a warning for all food safety.\" </p> <p>The head of Sanlu, the company at the heart of the baby milk scandal, has already been arrested after being sacked. Several farmers have also been held.</p> <p>City officials in Shijiazhuang, where Sanlu is based, were also sacked, with a senior provincial official saying they knew of the problem for over a month without taking action - only telling Beijing once the Olympics were over.</p> <p>Melamine, often used to make plastics, artificially boosts apparent protein levels in tests. That creates an incentive for farmers producing substandard milk to add the substance.</p> <p>China's food quality watchdog has said it found melamine in nearly 10% of milk and drinking yoghurt samples from three dairy companies, Mengniu, Yili and the Bright group.</p> <p>To date, no illnesses have been reported from melamine in other dairy products. Tests on infant formula from other producers also found that while melamine was present in batches from a fifth of China's dairy producers, the levels were far lower than in the case of Sanlu. </p> <p>But fear has spread rapidly among consumers, and the Chinese ministry of agriculture said despairing farmers were dumping milk and killing cattle after companies stopped buying their supplies. It promised subsidies to help struggling cattle farmers.</p> <p>Starbucks in China has started serving soya milk rather than dairy with its coffee.</p> <p>The government promised to tighten its safety regime after a number of product scandals which exposed corruption, bureaucratic inertia and cost-cutting producers. </p> <p>But China's dairy producers face a crisis of confidence that will only be cured by strong action, said Lao Bing, manager of a Shanghai-based dairy investment company. </p> <p>\"Consumers will start rebuying in a month or two if they feel sure the government is undertaking a vigorous clean-up,\" he told Reuters. \"Exports will take longer. This will have a major impact.\"</p>",
  "<p>Hip-hop legend has it that the rapper Ghostface Killah once insisted his record company give the marketing budget for his album directly to him. He then spent it on a bespoke 14-carat gold eagle statuette, which he wore on a bangle on his wrist. \"For any normal person, that is the stupidest thing you could do,\" writes Minya Oh, author of Bling Bling: Hip-Hop's Crown Jewels. \"But you can't argue that his strategy didn't work. Everyone talked about it, and no one will forget it.\"</p> <p>The love affair between hip-hop and jewellery will be celebrated in New York in a high-profile auction of some of the most spectacular pieces of status jewellery to be found outside of the Tower of London. The auction, originally scheduled for October 1, has attracted so much attention it has had to be postponed to allow pieces only recently brought to the auctioneers' attention to be included. </p> <p>Lots will include a crown ring belonging to the late Tupac Shakur, who was killed in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas in 1996. The ring was commissioned by the 25-year-old a few months before his death, an emblem of self-coronation in the wake of his success. It boasts 10 carats of cabochon rubies and pav\u00e9 diamonds, and is inscribed \"Pac &amp; Dada 1996\" in honour of Shakur's relationship with Quincy Jones's daughter Kidada. The estimated selling price is between $10,000 to $20,000, although this may be conservative - it is said Shakur was wearing the ring when he died. </p> <p>A piece made for Missy Elliot, which features a miniature turntable of black diamonds with a solid gold needle arm on a diamond studded cocktail ring - all parts fully moveable - is listed with an estimate of $8,000 to $12,000. </p> <p>The auction will raise funds for Rush Community Affairs, a charity founded by hip-hop entrepreneur Russell Simmons, and for the Smithsonian Institution's fledgling hip-hop archive. Phillips de Pury auction house believes the sale will create a new collecting category of historic hip-hop jewellery.</p> <p>The jewels being considered for the auction tell the story of how diamonds overtook shell-toe Adidas as hip-hop's signature look. A gold, mushroom-shaped ring embossed with the profile of Nefertiti, worn by MC Lyte, recalls how the first generation of female rappers saw themselves continuing the style of the queens of African history. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the cassette and headphone pendants given by Biz Markie, encrusted with black and white diamonds, show that even during its early \"two turntables and a microphone\" era, diamonds were a (hip-hop) boy's best friend. </p> <p>Jewellery, the bigger and sparklier the better, became a loudspeaker for many messages. Featured in the auction is Lil Jon's Crunk Ain't Dead necklace, a defence of the southern style of hip-hop, which weighs 5.4kg (12lbs) and features 3,756 diamonds. A diamond-studded black Jesus pendant worn by Kanye West, who often refers to religion in his lyrics, is also likely to be included. </p> <p>The acquisition of ostentatious jewellery became a rite-of-passage for hip-hop stars. Flaunting bling forced the world to acknowledge their success, as measured in material wealth. A yellow gold and stainless steel Rolex with diamond bezel in the auction was the first sizable piece bought by the late Notorious BIG when he achieved fame. </p> <p>As hip-hop entered the mainstream, a new generation of self-styled \"hip-hop moguls\" took conspicuous consumption to levels undreamt of by their 1980s predecessors. Sean Diddy Combs, says Oh, \"elevated 'ghetto fabulousness' into public theatre\". </p> <p>Combs' princess- and diamond-cut diamond and platinum bracelet, which will be offered in the auction, exemplifies hip-hop at its bling extreme, as does Pharrell Williams' multicoloured diamond and white gold Gucci link necklace, which carries an estimate of up to $250,000. </p> <p>The total sale value of the 70 lots in the auction is estimated at $3m (\u00a31.6m).</p> <p>\"It's all about getting people to look at you,\" says rapper Big Daddy Kane in Oh's book. But the level of interest in this auction, now scheduled for March 5 next year, suggests that there is more to it than that. There are subtleties and historical differences in the meaning of bling. Ghostface Killah, after all, might have been following the advice of the Duke of Newcastle at the time of the Restoration. \"When you appear... show yourself gloriously, to your people: like a God,\" counselled the Duke to Charles II on the eve of his coronation. Self-aggrandisation via diamonds has a long and illustrious history.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>Hip-hop's obsession with jewellery began with a serious point. It represented rappers transcending their hardscrabble <strong>origins</strong> and, unlike previous generations of black musicians, refusing to be ripped off by the industry: a flashy, street-level version of <strong>black capitalism</strong>. On the cover of their 1987 album Paid in Full, Eric B &amp; Rakim underscored their <strong>message </strong>(\"Don't nuthin' move but the money\") by <strong>flaunting</strong> oversized gold watches and medallions. During the 90s, rappers fetishised the most ostentatious fruits of wealth. By the time bling made its way into rap's lexicon<strong> </strong>at the end of the decade, <strong>conspicuous consumption </strong>was a well-worn clich\u00e9. Recent years have seen a minor <strong>backlash</strong>. Public Enemy's <strong>Chuck D </strong>is an opponent and <strong>Kanye West </strong>(right) re-recorded his 2005 single Diamonds from Sierra Leone to address concerns over <strong>conflict diamonds.</strong> The song namechecked celebrity gemsmith Jacob Arabov, aka Jacob the Jeweler, who was recently <strong>jailed </strong>for his part in a drug ring. But it will take more than a little <strong>controversy </strong>to separate rappers from their beloved bling.</p> <p><strong>Dorian Lynskey</strong></p>",
  "<p>For British universities the influx of large numbers of students from China and India has been a godsend. If you are trying to cope with decades of structural underfunding, vastly increased British undergraduate intakes, the declining attractiveness of academia as a career for UK graduates, and the need to fund capital projects (or expensive internal reorganisations), then of course you welcome these students with open arms. </p> <p>For its part, China attempts to meet its skills needs by sending students abroad, and aspirational middle-class parents also join in. In India, the vast excess of demand over supply, and the appalling state of much of India's education system for all but the elite - mainly central-government funded - institutions, as well as the cachet of British degrees make British universities attractive. But this cosy arrangement could well stub its toe on, if not trip over, several issues. </p> <p><strong>A cultural maze</strong></p> <p>Among Indian students recruited to British universities, more and more will have studied outside India's elite institutions, in an educational culture that remains credentialist and authoritarian. I recall discovering that most of the MPhil students I taught at a provincial institute in India had virtually no study skills and openly resented being invited and encouraged to engage with the texts and the issues; they thought that my job was to tell them what to say. </p> <p>A further issue had to do with the relation between inquiry and how we live; for most of the students I taught at that institute, there was no question of reconsidering deeply ingrained attitudes and practices, whatever the knowledge or the insights they gained in class or in fieldwork. Of course not all the students were like that, and many were just honest about marking time until the civil service exams, or about needing a higher degree for the marriage market.</p> <p>In my more recent postgraduate teaching in India I have been very explicit about areas such as time-planning, study skills, referencing conventions and even the layout of assessed essays. Only a handful of the students have had any prior inculcation of the craft of scholarship. And how is a lecturer in the UK, already under research assessment exercise imperatives and goodness knows what other administrative and bureaucratic burdens, to teach intensive study skills, and quite possibly give systematic English-language help, to large groups of students? </p> <p>Academic staff may not know of any need for preparatory work or extra help until it is too late. Recently, 20 out of 80 foreign students reputedly left a particular course because they found their English inadequate for the course. Apparently their university had ignored its own English-language requirements for overseas students. </p> <p>As an undergraduate students' union representative, I designed and put through senate the first English-language policy for overseas entrants to the British university where I studied, but for this kind of thing to occur 30-odd years later, no matter where, amounts to simple dishonesty. </p> <p>Are the students now entitled to refunds? If it turned out that managerial instructions were to ignore English-language requirements, or to mark certain groups of students more leniently than others, could students sue? Would the institution be in breach of anti-discrimination legislation?</p> <p>This could become a very nasty issue; surveys of Chinese students in the UK have brought to light their resentment at being treated as cash cows for British universities, and at lecturers communicating more with students from European cultures than with Chinese students.</p> <p>Much of this is unlikely to appear in formal institutional feedback. Authoritarian educational cultures do not encourage students to ask for help - much less express criticism - so official student feedback is often no more than bland approval, regardless of who is paying the fees; neither are universities' assurances of confidentiality likely to convince students from traditional and authoritarian educational backgrounds.</p> <p>Therefore, the kinds of ratings that are sometimes available to potential entrants abroad may well be systematically misleading. It is not just that recruiting agencies - engaged to cut UK universities' costs - are sometimes economical with the reality (they probably have to meet recruitment targets), but that students in very credentialist systems are often taken aback by the idea that the content of the course matters. </p> <p>My experience, and that of my current Indian academic colleagues, continues to be that the great majority of students who seek our advice on studying abroad are startled by the response, \"Yes, but what are you interested in, and why?\".</p> <p><strong>Bewildered</strong></p> <p>And while we tear our hair out, our young friends earnestly produce printouts showing how all the places they want to apply to have ratings of 4.99 out of 5, and stare in bewilderment as we try to explain the difference between the University of Blankton and what used to be Blankton Tech, or between county colleges and the Ivy League, and why it would be important to choose a place with a strong department in the student's area of interest. And if the student doesn't know what they're interested in? There's a hole in my bucket, dear Liza...</p> <p>It is not just that recruiting agencies cannot have the local knowledge that staff from particular universities have, but that content has disappeared in effect from the overseas recruitment trade. Earlier this year, a student of mine went to a British recruitment event, and returned saying they only wanted MBA and technology students with chequebooks at the ready; when he asked at several desks about an MA in critical theory, the staff had no idea what he was talking about. Even as I commiserated with my tutee, I had visions of harassed British academics giving crash courses on Habermas and Wittgenstein to middle-ranking functionaries before the latter went recruiting in Kashgar and Tirunelveli. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Dr Sivaramakrishnan is senior deputy editor on The Hindu, and a member of the adjunct faculty at the Asian College of Journalism, Chennai</p>",
  "<p>It sure is a swell show Labour is putting on in Manchester this week. Would that the usual hordes were here to see it. But many of the private sector exhibitors have stayed away from GMEX - a diary clash apparently; nothing to do with the smell of death. Just as conspicuous by their absence are the lobbyists. It has often been the custom of Bell Pottinger, one of the biggest of the big beasts, to throw a champagne party at the Labour shindig - and they will for the Tories next week. But for Manchester there's a just few pounds stashed behind the bar at an event thrown by the Fabians. At least they didn't send flowers.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Speaking of the Fabians, the group's debate entitled Can we give the white working class what they want? was notable for its sponsor Asda, whose representative spoke of the company's commitment to training and union learning. Lots of people thought immediately about Wal-Mart - Asda's parent company, which is famously hostile to unions in the US - but all of them stayed quiet. Admirable. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> And there was Iain Duncan Smith sitting in first class on the train to Manchester to participate in a debate on social inequality. One day we'll all travel that way.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Be nice to him, we said in June, when it emerged that the Sikh detective sergeant Gurpal Virdi had fought and won yet another case against the Met - his third. But no one listens to us in these matters. So here we go again. This time the issue was his inspector's exams in 2007, a process made more difficult by the fact that his studying was hampered by a serious eye condition. He sought a \"reasonable adjustment\" - that is, extra time - but despite all-round recognition that he was indeed hampered by this disability, the request was turned down and he failed. An employment tribunal was scheduled to hear all about it last Thursday, but on the morning of the hearing, the previously bullish Met performed another of its spectacular pirouettes: admitting fault, providing an apology and sending him - as is now traditional - a nice cheque, this time for \u00a34,500. So that's \u00a3240,000 in 2001, \u00a374,500 in 2008. Listen. Do nice. It's cheaper. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> No end in sight, we fear, for the race row at the National Union of Students. An inquiry has cleared the president of King's College London student union, after the furore sparked by a training event at which he appeared to link the prospect of more minority undergraduates with fears of more gun and knife crime. He says that he was merely making non-racist remarks about security, and the union appears to have accepted that. Nevertheless, it suggests he re-acquaints himself with the equal opportunities policy. The NUS inquiry into the other charmer reported to have scandalised the same event with his Bring Back Slavery sign is ongoing, but seems unlikely to satisfy the black students who first raised the complaints. President Wes Streeting gets to sort it all out. Lucky him.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> So is it a crash or is it a correction? The smart money says crash will win out. And it makes a better headline. It will touch every area of our national life, and our man in the stands points out that on March 4 next year, when Newcastle United next play champions Manchester United, it will in essence be a battle between the British taxpayer, for we fund Newcastle's sponsor, Northern Rock, and the US taxpayer, who now owns 80% of United's sponsor AIG. War by other means ... and this time we'll win. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> But anything is better than a shooting war. Certainly that's what they would say in Georgia. No one knows exactly what it was that led Putin and his manservant Medvedev to withdraw the troops, but Georgian websites have their theories. The news site <a href=\"http://www.finchannel.com\">finchannel.com</a> says the Russians pulled back because they faced a terrible slating on Facebook, and this must be broadly right because they got it from the satirical UK site, <a href=\"http://www.NewsBiscuit.co.uk\">NewsBiscuit</a>.

  "<p>Sarah Palin has thrown herself into a 36-hour crash course in foreign diplomacy as she makes a highly publicised visit to the UN in New York this week in an attempt to shrug off the perception that she is an international affairs ing\u00e9nue.</p> <p>The Republican vice-presidential candidate, who obtained a passport to travel outside North America for the first time only last year, is meeting a raft of leaders from several of the world's current hotspots. But her cramming timetable fails to include any scheduled encounter with a major European leader.</p> <p>Her induction begins tonight with attendance at a cocktail party held by President George Bush at the city's Waldorf-Astoria. The Lebanese president, Michel Suleiman, and other leaders, carefully selected for their goodwill towards America, were on the guest list.</p> <p>Even before Palin takes her first steps today into the UN's international territory on the East Side of Manhattan, she has walked into controversy. She had been billed to appear at a rally outside the UN building organised by New York Jewish groups protesting at the arrival of the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, at the annual UN general assembly.</p> <p>But Palin's invitation was withdrawn by organisers following a public spat with Hillary Clinton. The senator for New York had accepted an offer to attend but pulled out saying Palin's late inclusion on the speaker list would have politicised the event.</p> <p>The New York Sun yesterday published the speech that Palin would have made had she appeared at the rally. In it, she calls for action to thwart Ahmadinejad, who she says should be held accountable under international law for the crime of inciting genocide. \"He must be stopped,\" the speech says.</p> <p>Since her appointment as John McCain's running mate last month Palin has faced stiff criticism, and even ridicule, for her lack of international experience. Democratic opponents have pointed out she is just one heartbeat away from the presidency should McCain fall ill in office.</p> <p>The McCain campaign unwittingly fanned the flames by emphasising that as governor of Alaska she was knowledgeable about neighbouring Russia. The theme was picked up in a Saturday Night Live spoof in which Tina Fey has Palin say: \"I can see Russia from my house.\"</p> <p>Bloggers also went to town after a television interview in which she was flummoxed by a reference to the \"Bush doctrine\", the argument that pre-emptive strikes against threatening states or terrorist groups can be justified.</p> <p>The main effort to dispel the impression of naivety will begin today when Palin enters the UN. In meetings that will continue into tomorrow, she will meet leaders from many of the world's most sensitive regions. But according to the list put out by Reuters, there will be no western European leaders among her engagements. It has been confirmed that the British government has neither been approached by the Palin team, nor sought any contact.</p> <p>The only British minister she could meet casually is Kim Howells, the junior Foreign Office minister, who will attend the Bush cocktail party.</p> <p>She will meet the presidents of Afghanistan and Iraq, Hamid Karzai and Jalal Talabani, as well as the leader of the main US ally in Latin America, Alvaro Uribe of Colombia. The new Pakistani president, Asif Ali Zardari, is on the list, as is Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh.</p> <p>There is no seat at the Palin table for China or notably Russia after the conflict in Georgia, though the presidents of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili, and Ukraine, Viktor Yushchenko, are included.</p> <p>Peter Beinart, senior fellow of the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, said the cast was unsurprising. \"These are all leaders of countries considered friendly to the US. McCain is a more us-versus-them kind of guy than Obama, and you can see that reflected on the list.\"</p> <p>The other interesting entry on the list is Henry Kissinger, whom Palin will meet today. The former US secretary of state under Richard Nixon was once highly divisive, but now occupies a lofty position as elder statesman and has been frequently consulted by Bush.</p> <h2>Meet and greet</h2> <p>On<strong> Tuesday</strong> the Republican vice-presidential candidate will meet the Afghan president, <strong>Hamid Karzai</strong>, and the Colombian president, <strong>Alvaro Uribe</strong>, and will also enjoy a sit-down with the former US secretary of state <strong>Henry Kissinger</strong>. On<strong> Wednesday </strong>she is lined up to meet a string of world leaders, including the Iraqi president, <strong>Jalal Talabani</strong>. Palin also has scheduled meetings with the Georgian president, <strong>Mikheil Saakashvili</strong>, the Ukrainian leader, <strong>Viktor Yushchenko</strong>, the new Pakistani president, <strong>Asif Ali Zardari</strong>, and the Indian prime minister, <strong>Manmohan Singh</strong>. She will also meet U2 singer and activist <strong>Bono</strong>.</p>",
  "<p>A friend of mine recently jumped in a cab in Liverpool and asked to be taken to see La Princesse, the giant mechanical spider then menacing the Albert Dock. \"Right ho,\" said the cabbie. \"I love a bit of French situationism.\" He then went on to talk about les \u00e9v\u00e9nements and Paris in 1968. Maybe the cabbie - his name was Rob Parr - was in Liverpool the last time situationism was big here, back in the late 1970s, when Ken Campbell would mount massive sci-fi epics and insist members of the cast wear their costumes on the way to work, to help break down the barrier between theatre and bus stop. Campbell, who died last month, was the dean of studies of a kind of countercultural university whose campus took in Liverpool's theatres (or their bars), Probe Records (or the steps outside the shop) and Eric's, a club whose brief, brilliant life is about to be celebrated in a new musical. </p> <p>Eric's was the most important punk club in Liverpool, a members-only, live-music venue at a time when live performance held all the cards. The best bands' records received limited distribution and little airplay, so you spent more time reading about them than actually listening to them. Every performance, therefore, promised a revelation, and not always in a good way. I remember pushing my way to the front at Eric's to see Iggy Pop, in the belief that I was about to behold a steaming great rock'n'roll Beelzebub. When the surprisingly tiny Iggy flounced onto the stage, someone shouted: \"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Mr Melvyn Hayes!\" Iggy's resemblance to the It Ain't Half Hot Mum actor was as amazing as it was bathetic. </p> <p>But it wasn't as disconcerting as the night I saw the legendary Nico in the club, and told her I loved her. \"Really?\" she said. \"Do you have any money? I seem to be a little short.\" I gave her one of my two 50-pence pieces - but she spotted the other one and, unable to bear her look of disappointment, I handed over my train fare and walked the 11 miles home.</p> <p>Eric's was tiny and dangerously overcrowded, but I remember hardly any trouble. Perhaps it was because the place attracted few girls (though the ones who were there were great), and therefore tended to empty out after the band had finished, as lads went off in search of women. It might also have been because of the popularity of pogoing as the dance of the day: the overcrowding meant that most people danced in the space-saving vertical dimension.</p> <p>The overcrowding also made the gap between audience and band, reality and possibility, seem more easily bridgeable. Nearly everyone in the club was in a band - but almost all the bands were imaginary. Making up a name and designing a button badge, even a poster, seemed to take priority over acquiring actual personnel or, indeed, instruments. </p> <p>One of the most important bands - the Crucial Three (Julian Cope, Ian McCullouch and Pete Wylie) - never actually played. Others would have been a lot better had they followed this example: Big in Japan, for instance, seemed to do nothing but stand on stage furiously yelling the phrase \"Big in Japan\" at the audience. But Big in Japan were only the second worst band on earth. Warsaw had a Bowie wannabe singer and were rubbish. One night they turned up with the same lineup but a different name. I saw right through the disguise and left, dragging my mates with me. The band's new name was Joy Division. </p> <p>If you hung around a similar club in Birmingham or Sheffield or Glasgow at that time, you would probably have similar stories. What was different about Eric's was the feeling that the music was part of some sort of cultural experiment, and that we were guinea pigs, or possibly pupils. Maybe it was the slightly patrician air of its owner, Roger Eagle, who was clearly on a mission to educate us all. The place is remembered as a punk club but in fact a very wide range of music - Stax, reggae, Cajun - was played there. </p> <p>Although I dine out on the great bands I saw at Eric's, the truth is I wasn't really that interested in the musicians. For me, it was more about the audience - being with people of my own age who were all suddenly aglow with the possibilities of their own creativity. And ego. Pete Wylie, for one, always gave the impression that he thought the Ramones, say, had come all that way from the US just to look at him.</p> <p>Mark Davies Markham, who has written Eric's - the Musical, puts it this way: \"It was the inspirational place that working-class kids had been hoping for.\" He also says: \"The day I discovered Eric's, my grey world turned Dayglo.\" I'd add that it wasn't just about working-class kids but everyone who thought life could be brighter. Many regulars ended up in bands that you will have heard of, some good, some bad, some banally successful, some magnificently wayward, among them Echo and the Bunnymen, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, The Teardrop Explodes, and on and on. And it wasn't just bands. People with an Eric's background ended up as politicians, community activists, fine artists, journalists, film-makers. I think perhaps that art's real function is to bring people together, and that it only has to be good enough to serve as a pretext for this. </p> <p>I don't know Markham, but it seems remarkable to me that we were both at Eric's unofficial opening night and here we are 30 years later, each about to open a show in Liverpool inspired by those days. Markham's is a musical about a man in crisis looking back to Eric's; mine (Proper Clever) is a flamboyant modern comedy, partly inspired by the fact that Roger Eagle arranged alcohol-free matinees at Eric's, so that youngsters like me could get a taste of that glorious moment. It's my way of saying thank you. </p> <p>The Christmas after Eric's was opened, I was offered a place at Oxford university. At the time, that didn't seem so different from being recruited by Nasa or appearing on Top of the Pops, but I hesitated - it seemed unthinkable to leave Eric's behind. When I mentioned this to a DJ at the club called Mike Knowler, he sat me down and told me that Eric's would be finished within a year and I'd be kicking myself if I didn't grab the chance.</p> <p>Which brings me back to that spider. Eric's raised the game of everyone who went there, and it did it without official help. The club was only possible because there was cheap real estate in the city centre, and because the punters didn't mind standing up to their ankles in urine when they used the toilets. In the end, it was closed down by the police in a raid: one night the club was suddenly filled with policemen and dogs and there was a panicked scramble for the exits. A young radio journalist, Christine Ruth, made a dash for the BBC's Merseyside studios to alert the nation. </p> <p>In those days, culture was in opposition to the economy. Now, culture works in partnership with the economy, and Liverpool's Capital of Culture year is expected to contribute to its prosperity. Watching the spider walk into the crowd on Albert Dock is the most excited I've been by a work of art since my Eric's days. But will that spider - thrilling as it was - inspire my children the way Eric's inspired me? Can you really have situationism by invitation? Would Mike Knowler have done what he did for me if he'd thought of me as a customer, rather than as a member of the same club? I'm asking because I want to know. I'm asking because I would really love to do it all again.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 Eric's - The Musical </strong>is at the Everyman, Liverpool, until October 11. Box office: 0151-709 4776</p>",
  "<p>When a man has so many medals that they already fill his chest, another may not mean so much. But Harry Patch, the last known surviving British soldier of the 3 million who served on the western front during the first world war, yesterday graciously accepted one more, the knighthood of the Order of Leopold, as Belgium's tribute for his services and those of all his dead colleagues.</p> <p>Patch, who has just passed his 110th birthday, served with the 7th Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry until he was wounded in the trenches in front of Ypres in the summer of 1917 during the early phases of the battle of Passchendaele. Ninety-one years on, he sat passively in a wheelchair as Jean-Michel Veranneman de Watervliet, the Belgian ambassador to London, made the presentation in a reception room at the ambassador's residence in London.</p> <p>If he seemed bemused, it may have been at the thought that it is his longevity that has brought celebrity and the L\u00e9gion d'honneur from France, interviews, an autobiography and television crews beating a path to his nursing home in Somerset. When he was demobbed in 1919, Patch went back to his job as a plumber and did not speak about his war experiences for 80 years.</p> <p>His silence yesterday may also have been due to the fact that September 22 is usually sombre - the anniversary of the day in 1917 when three other members of his Lewis gun crew were blown to pieces as they moved back from the frontline and Patch's stomach was ripped open by a piece of flying shrapnel. By such accidents of fate did some men die in their teens while their comrade is now Britain's second oldest man.</p> <p>At his side, the ambassador was speaking of the great honour of welcoming him as a representative of the British and colonial troops who came to help Belgium in its hour of need, to keep it free from occupation - or at least, he might have added, the small corner of the country around the Ypres salient. \"I salute all of them, so many of whom now lie for ever in my country ... we should think of all of them with a lot of respect as well as those, as you rightly said yourself, who were on the other side and were brave men too, doing their duty,\" the ambassador said.</p> <p>Afterwards, Patch's friend James Ross, who with his wife Lesley had brought him to London, said: \"When Harry was preparing to go into another battle, he could not possibly have thought that little country would be central to a united and peaceful Europe. If his comrades had wanted anything, they would have wanted the peace and tranquillity Belgium now represents.\"</p> <p>Patch is due back there later this week, to unveil a plaque, meet civic dignitaries and visit once more the spot where he and his comrades went over the top. Though hard of hearing he can still read without glasses and certainly knew what was happening yesterday. Sipping a glass of the ambassador's champagne, he whispered: \"It's a very great honour. I am OK but I don't think I could run a mile. I like Belgium now. I like the chocolate.\"</p> <p>Lesley Ross said: \"Memories of the war still disturb him even now. Above the door in his room there's a window and across the corridor a laundry room, and sometimes when the attendants went in there and switched on the light in the middle of the night, the sudden flash would wake him and bring back memories of the trenches. He still has nightmares. They've covered the window over now.\"</p>",
  "<p>John Stewart was living in south London six years ago when two things happened that seriously affected his health. \"First the flight paths were changed so planes passed over my flat every 90 seconds. Then a nearby laundry centralised all its activities into one site, so the noise of the machines permeated the whole block. They were going all day and during the night,\" he says.</p> <p>\"I had to have the radio and TV on, even if I didn't want to, just so I didn't have to hear the outside noise. My sleep became interrupted and I ended up getting heart palpitations. My doctor said my blood pressure was too high, he was very worried about my heart, and I needed to take some serious action to reduce the stress before it killed me.\" After Stewart moved house, he slowly got better.</p> <p>There is growing evidence that noise-related stress is a significant public health hazard. According to a report from the World Health Organisation, unwanted noise is causing hearing impairment including tinnitus, disturbing our sleep and triggering stress hormones which could in turn affect the immune system and metabolism. </p> <p>It also makes us feel helpless and more aggressive and increases the chances of having a heart attack or stroke, accounting for an estimated 3% of ischeamic heart disease (the most common cause of death in the EU) in Europe. \"There is increasing evidence that air and road traffic noise might be related to high blood pressure,\" says Stephen Stansfeld, professor of psychiatry at Barts and the London School of Medicine. \"Exposure in school to aircraft noise is also linked to reading impairment in children.\"</p> <p>Another study, by Cornell University in New York, found that workers in an open-plan office with constant exposure to hubbub from machinery, telephones and office chatter had higher levels of adrenaline in their urine than workers in a quiet, self-contained work station. The open-plan group were also less effective at puzzle solving than the quiet group, who slept better, had better digestion, and were less irritable.</p> <p>\"When people get annoyed by noise they get stressed,\" says Stewart, who went on to set up the National Noise Association pressure group. \"Constant exposure to even moderate levels of noise can be harmful. One Austrian study showed that children living on a main road had shorter concentration spans than those who didn't.\"</p> <p>Small wonder then that noise is slowly inching up the political agenda. Last year, EU law required all European cities with populations of more than 250,000 to produce digitised noise maps. \"People think that we should 'live and let live' and only old people complain about noise,\" says Richard Tur, one of a growing number of anti-noise activists and founder of the US organisation NoiseOFF. \"But we need to change our perception of what noise actually is - unwanted sound which can be physically harmful.\"</p> <p>The big offenders, says Stewart, are loud music, aircraft and traffic, and the problem seems to be getting worse. One report from Sheffield Hallam University showed that some parts of Sheffield were up to 10 times noisier than 10 years previously while the UK Office of National Statistics suggests that noise complaints have increased fivefold in the past 20 years. </p> <p>Short of joining the half a million people who moved home in 2006 to escape a distressing din, here's our guide to surviving noisy Britain.</p> <h2>Take control </h2> <p>Not feeling in control of a situation significantly increases stress. Stansfeld says it is important to take action such as complaining about the noise.</p> <h2>Change your perception</h2> <p>A study funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs found that CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) and hypnotherapy helped reduce stress in those disturbed by low-frequency noise such as the low rumble of distant traffic, or the hum from an electric generator. \"CBT is partly about enabling people to control the thing that is bugging them, rather than it controlling them,\" says noise and vibration consultant Dr Geoff Leventhall, who conducted the study. \"Try the following exercise: Visualise the noise as a big black ball. Move it around, nearer, further away, or change its colour and size if you want, and explode it. The point is to take control of whatever is worrying you.\"</p> <p>Trying to change your perception of the situation is particularly helpful if the culprit is moderate noise which doesn't distress others (20-30% of the UK population are thought to be particularly noise-sensitive). \"The meaning of noise is very important,\" says Stansfeld. \"If you are lonely then hearing other people's parties can be upsetting. Airbases that emphasise their positive benefits to the local community are more warmly received than those that don't.\" To take part in the second stage of the study, go to <a href=\"http://www.copingwithnoise.org\">copingwithnoise.org</a>.</p> <h2>Focus on 'flow' activities</h2> <p>Doing things that are so enjoyable and absorbing that we lose sense of time may also distract from moderate noise. \"A difficult crossword, perhaps, a favourite hobby, or reading or watching something gripping,\" suggests Stewart.</p> <h2>Learn relaxation techniques</h2> <p>\"Anything that relaxes you will also help,\" says Leventhall, who recommends this meditative technique: \"Sit in a comfortable chair and repeat 'peace' or 'one', for example, with each exhalation, for 10 or 20 minutes every day. The body responds with a dramatic decrease in heart rate, breathing rate, blood pressure (if elevated to begin with), and metabolic rate - the exact opposite of the fight-or-flight response.\"</p> <h2>Block it out</h2> <p>\"For noisy streets, try thermal double glazing\", says John Hinton, president of the Institute of Acoustics, or try secondary glazing, adding an extra window pane four inches or so inside the existing double-glazed window. \"Reduce aircraft noise by increasing the sound insulation of the loft, and put up fencing to reduce traffic noise.\" </p> <p>And noisy neighbours? \"Increase the mass of the dividing wall or the floor by adding another layer of plasterboard,\" says Hinton. Push for \"low-noise road surfaces\" from local authorities and fit 'low-noise tyres\" to cars. Soft foam earplugs marginally reduce noise (the equivalent of standing in the next room) and office din can be neutralised with noise-maskers such as ChatterBlocker software (<a href=\"http://www.chatterblocker.com\">chatterblocker.com</a>). Or if your computer is the culprit, try <a href=\"http://www.quietpc.com\">quietpc.com</a>. Other noise-busting tips can be found at <a href=\"http://www.noiseoff.org\">noiseoff.org</a>.</p> <h2>Protect yourself</h2> <p>Not all noise-related health risks come from other people. DIY, concerts, clubs and listening to iPods are common causes of ear damage such as tinnitus, says David Baguley, director of audiology at Cambridge University Hospitals.</p> <p>Party animals should protect their ears by not mixing music with intoxication (\"smoking and drinking both affect the protective mechanism of the inner ear,\" says Baguley), wearing Etymotic earplugs at gigs (\"they reduce sound but keep music exciting\") and taking 10 minutes out of every hour exposed to loud music. \"Ditch the earphones that come with iPods,\" he adds, \"and invest in noise-cancelling headphones.\" These muffle unwanted noise so you can enjoy music at lower volumes. Finally, for noisy DIY, use ear-defenders (acoustic ear muffs).</p> <h2>Spend time in quiet places</h2> <p>Finally, buck the trend of the 22% of all Londoners who, according to one poll, had not experienced silence in over six months. \"There is evidence to show that finding peace and quiet can help people physically, emotionally and mentally,\" says Stewart.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Noise Association's guide, <a href=\"http://www.thequietguide.co.uk\">thequietguide.co.uk</a>.

  "<p>The concept of a Wall Street investment bank was in its death throes yesterday as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs succumbed to a collapse in confidence in their financial stability by converting themselves into lower risk, tightly regulated commercial banks.</p> <p>Beset by plunging share prices and alarmed by the demise of competitors, the last two standalone Wall Street banks took licences from the Federal Reserve that allow them to take deposits from the public, backed by government guarantees.</p> <p>While safeguarding customers' money, the change will radically restrict the firms' activities by imposing strict limits on the risks their traders can take on the markets and on the amount of money they can borrow. Morgan Stanley further shored up its financial position by selling a stake of up to 20% in itself to Japan's Mitsubishi Financial Group for an estimated $8-9bn (\u00a34-5bn).</p> <p>The hurriedly agreed change in the two banks' status happened without the usual 30-day waiting period. It came as Congress began scouring legislation to enact a $700bn government bail-out for banks through the creation of a state-sponsored body to take on \"toxic\" underperforming mortgage-backed assets.</p> <p>The head of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein, said it would now be seen as an \"even more secure institution\"; Morgan Stanley's boss, John Mack, said it offered \"certainty about the strength of our financial position and our access to funding\".</p> <p>Only last week, both firms were vigorously defending the viability of their business models in spite of a sell-off that sent their stock down by 20-30% on consecutive days. They insist that unlike former rivals such as Lehman and Bear Stearns, they are profitable and have few problems. But insiders accept the landscape has changed. One said: \"Given the events of the last few months, particularly the last week, it has become very clear that the market places a premium on safety.\"</p> <p>Bill Isaac, a former head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the government agency that guarantees depositors' accounts, said it was the end of Wall Street banking as it had been known. \"They're the only two left, and the writing was on the wall,\" he said. \"It's a shame because this country was built, in part, on risk-taking by Goldman and Morgan and by a whole bunch of firms before them.\"</p> <p>Analysts say the banks' new status will limit their ability to dabble in the exotic derivatives and credit instruments that contributed to the crunch. Banks' risks are generally judged by a leverage ratio of assets to borrowing. Morgan Stanley's ratio reached 33 last year and Goldman Sachs's touched 28. High-street banks tend to be in the low teens or below.</p> <p>David Williams, an analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton in New York, said: \"There are going to be higher levels of regulation, lower leverage ratios, greater scrutiny on what they do.\"</p> <p>Neither Goldman nor Morgan Stanley has immediate plans to open networks of high-street branches. Morgan Stanley already has about 300 branch offices and is expected to offer a broader range of services at the counter. Goldman intends to bid for deposits on a wholesale basis - for example, by stepping in to become custodian when local banks struggle in the US. </p> <p>Between them, the banks hold about $56bn for rich private clients in their wealth management businesses; this money is now guaranteed by taxpayers.</p> <p>Bear Stearns' collapse in March was the beginning of the end for Wall Street's \"big five\" standalone investment banks. Lehman Brothers went bankrupt last week, although its US operation reopened yesterday under Barclays' ownership. Merrill Lynch is set to be swallowed through a $50bn buyout by Bank of America.</p> <p>Alarmed by the pace of events, the Bush administration is pushing for swift legislation on a $700bn bail-out. The government plan was a large part of the reason why the price of oil surged by more than $11 a barrel to reach $115.70 in New York yesterday, as traders speculated on improved economic conditions. But in early trading, Wall Street stocks were sharply down, with the Dow Jones industrial average losing as much as 200 points.</p> <h2>Historical division</h2> <p>The <strong>Glass-Steagall Act</strong> was passed in 1933 to separate the activities of <strong>commercial</strong> and <strong>investment</strong> banking. </p> <p>Named after Senator Carter Glass and Congressman Henry Steagall, the act was a response to commercial banks' stockmarket <strong>speculation</strong>, which was widely seen as contributing to the <strong>Wall Street Crash </strong>of 1929. Banks were using depositors' money to take a punt on stockmarkets as well as reselling shares back to their retail customers. The act forced banks to <strong>specialise </strong>in commercial or investment banking. Many bankers saw it as draconian response and <strong>campaigned against it </strong>for years on the basis that diversification helped spread risks. The act was finally <strong>repealed </strong>in 1999.</p>",
  "<p>A Ugandan government official who received bribes from a British company director yesterday became the first person to be convicted of overseas corruption since Britain tightened up its anti-bribery laws. Ananias Tumukunde, a 31-year-old adviser to Uganda's president, Yoweri Museveni, was jailed for a year at Southwark crown court. Niels Tobiasen, the 65-year-old managing director of a Wiltshire-based firm, has pleaded guilty to paying \u00a380,000 in bribes and is due to be sentenced on Friday. </p> <p>Tobiasen's firm had been given a contract to protect world leaders, including the Queen and Gordon Brown, at a Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Kampala last November. </p> <p>Judge James Wadsworth told Tumukunde, who was arrested when he came to Britain for medical treatment, that he had \"dishonestly pocketed\" the backhanders, adding: \"What you did is serious.\" </p> <p>The British government signed up to a global anti-bribery treaty in 1997, and in 2002 outlawed the payment of bribes by British companies to officials and politicians abroad to secure contracts. But the government has been criticised by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which polices the treaty, for its poor record in prosecuting offenders. Anti-corruption campaigners who criticised the decision to terminate the Serious Fraud Office investigation into alleged bribery of Saudis by BAE, Britain's biggest arms company, gave yesterday's conviction a guarded welcome. Nick Hildyard, of Corner House, said: \"It's a good start, but there's still a long way to go. Other countries have not shied away from taking on the big companies.\"</p> <p>In May last year, Tobiasen's firm, CBRN, was given a \u00a3210,000 contract by the Ugandan government to supply training and equipment to guard the Commonwealth meeting, attended by 50 world leaders and 4,000 delegates. David Whittaker, prosecuting, told the court that a month later, Tumukunde went to CBRN's offices and demanded extra payments for what he called \"local tax\". He told Tobiasen that the payments were \"common\" in Uganda. The contract was one of six worth a total of \u00a3500,000 that were given to the company. By February this year, Tobiasen had sent five payments worth \u00a383,000 to Tumukunde and a Ugandan military officer, Rusoke Tagaswire, who is still wanted by police. </p> <p>Detectives from the City of London police learned of the payments and arrested Tobiasen on April 2. </p> <p>The following day, Tumukunde was arrested at Heathrow. At first he denied that the payments were bribes, but yesterday he pleaded guilty. Rupert Pardoe, defending, said the amount that Tumukunde had actually received was about \u00a312,000, which he was going to give to his ill mother. The judge recommended that Tumukunde be deported after finishing his sentence.</p> <p>Yesterday's conviction was secured by the overseas corruption unit of the City of London police, set up 18 months ago. The business secretary, John Hutton, said: \"The UK performs well on tackling corruption compared to our closest competitors, but we can still do more ... Next year, we will propose important law reforms to strengthen our crackdown on the companies who pay bribes and foreign officials who take them.\"</p>",
  "<p>Slight, polite and genial, rapper-turned-fashion mogul Andre Benjamin - aka Andre 3000 - arrives for breakfast at Harrods wearing a duffel coat, polo shirt and baseball cap. Ostensibly, he is here to have a look at the corner of the menswear department where the Knightsbridge store will be displaying his latest Benjamin Bixby collection, a range of 1930s-influenced American football clobber, including cashmere cardies, numbered sweaters and fitted sweat tops. But evidently he couldn't resist a retail detour: a big white tote from Hackett, his favourite British shop, sits by his off-white and brown \"saddle\" shoes, bulging with sweet-smelling, tweedy booty from his morning spree. And it's only 10am.</p> <p>Shopping in London is the ultimate pleasure, admits Benjamin. He finds it inspirational, educational and thrillingly old-school. \"I love old things,\" he says. \"In the US, we are not that old. We have old stores and cool vintage stuff, but nothing like you have over here.\" </p> <p>Benjamin is an oddity in the sartorially prescriptive rap fraternity. A renaissance-man alternative to the aggressive knuckleheadery of, say, 50 Cent, Benjamin paints, reads, acts and plays the violin (and many other instruments). A vegetarian, he campaigns for Peta, the anti-fur lobby. Musically speaking, the 32-year-old from Atlanta, Georgia, who is one half of OutKast, is at the cutting edge of gonzo hip-hop with hits such as Ms Jackson, Roses and Hey Ya!, but when it comes to his wardrobe, he's 80% Brideshead. </p> <p>He likes the rake of our straw hats and the equestrian cut of our traditional suits. He favours shirts with cutaway collars, rugby jerseys, brightly coloured hoop socks and co-respondent shoes. He likes the temperate British climate because it means he can wear one of his many Scottish tweeds. Talk to him and he'll reference the Duke of Windsor and Beau Brummell. When it comes to dressing, \"those guys killed it,\" he'll tell you. </p> <p>Benjamin's frequent trips to London find him trawling Portobello market for vintage tweed, cords and old shoes. On Jermyn Street, he'll check out the shirts and ties at Turnbull &amp; Asser, Hilditch &amp; Key, New &amp; Lingwood, then make a short diversion to St James's to see the hats at Lock (\"If you ask me, a good hat can make or break an outfit\") and Lobb's exquisite bespoke shoes a few doors along. Then it's Henry Poole on Savile Row, where he'll finger some gold-braided Napoleonic livery, leaf through one of the old order books, maybe order a blazer. </p> <p>Hackett, the young Sloane's outfitters, is his favourite stop-off. Benjamin spends a small fortune there and knows all the staff. \"You might think that a rapper from the deep south of America might not be our typical customer,\" admits Hackett's co-founder Jeremy Hackett. \"But the fact that Andre comes at our clothes from a different perspective, not burdened with any of the preconceptions about class and sartorial stereotypes that a British customer might have, means he looks at the clothes in a new and fresh way. He puts our stuff together in a way that we never imagined and he is totally fearless with colour combinations. He's got a really good eye.\" </p> <p>Benjamin has got the fashion thing bad. It's been like this ever since he was at Sutton middle school in Atlanta. Back then, there were two rival gangs stalking the corridors and hanging out by the lockers - the prep crew and the soul kids. \"The soul kids wore Jordache jeans cut at the bottom, Stan Smith sneakers, silk shirts and Starter jackets,\" he says. \"The preppy kids were from better homes and they could afford the preppy clothes. Tretorn tennis shoes, madras pants, Ralph Lauren polo shirts, mostly. They had the coolest girls and they had Volkswagen Rabbit [Golf] cars.\" </p> <p>Sometimes the two gangs would clash in elegantly wardrobed street violence. \"You know, like in the 1950s when you had gang fights? Like West Side Story? It was like that. You had a whole other side with guys that were from the streets but dressed like they were rich preppies.\" </p> <p>Most notorious was a preppy gang called the Stray Cats, who wore Benetton tennis bags slung over their shoulders. \"Only thing was, nobody played tennis. But they used to take the racquets to school and use them as weapons whenever they got in a fight.\" </p> <p>Benjamin, an only child, wanted to be a preppy but he was never in a gang. \"My mom was too strict to ever let me get involved in that stuff.\" After his estate agent mum and collections agent father split up, his mother worked on the production line at General Motors to make ends meet; money was tight. \"If I wanted nice clothes I'd have to wait for Christmas. I couldn't wait. I got a job. But if you couldn't buy them, you stole the clothes. Or you'd get your girlfriend to steal them for you.\"</p> <p>Increasingly frustrated by his hometown's lazy, parochial attitude to fashion, Benjamin and a school friend would buy dye to colour their jeans. \"We were trying to find ways to be individual, find our identities, I guess.\" They would pore over men's fashion magazines and watch old movies. Benjamin became fascinated by the understated Anglophilia and Gatsbyish exotica of Ralph Lauren adverts, which peddled dress codes that appeared to have been handed down from father to son like family heirlooms. \"I think a lot of African-American kids don't have fathers to teach them how to dress, so you end up being taught by pictures in magazine and movies. You see cowboys, Indians, old Hollywood films, Cary Grant. It has an effect on you.\" </p> <p>Was there something subversive about a poor young black kid dressing up in the preppy duds that were the privileged mufti of the Wasps? \"A little. I guess it's all about the twist, really. Everything is slower in the south. But we wanted to educate ourselves. Every kid was a fashion victim back then, but as you get older you learn and you become the killer not the victim.\"</p> <p>But before Benjamin could mutate into a gentleman designer, he embarked on a sartorial journey that took him beyond button-down collars and deck shoes. \"When I decided to become an entertainer things became even more extreme,\" he says. OutKast - Benjamin and another high school friend, Antwan \"Big Boi\" Patton - released their first album, Southernplayalisticadillacmusik, in 1994. But despite the influence of Cameo and George Clinton in the music, they looked fairly conventional. Hip-hop seemed to tame fashion-forward Benjamin for a while. \"If you watch the career of OutKast, look at all our pictures and videos, you'll see that at the start, even though I was writing out-of-this-world lyrics, I really just wanted to fit in, wearing baseball jerseys and sneakers. But the more I got into what I was doing, the more I started to think, to hell with what everyone else is doing.</p> <p>\"When the OutKast sound changed and I started producing my own records, I would mirror what I thought that character doing that music would look like. As the sound got a little wilder, freakier and funkier, so did the clothes. Then when the sound got more sophisticated, the clothes changed again.\" </p> <p>At first, he channelled the outlandish get-ups of his funk and rock heroes - Cameo, Funkadelic, Sly Stone, Hendrix even. He wore white wigs and designed himself a pair of fake-fur pants. He scoured fabric shops in Atlanta for material - \"upholstery fabric, mainly\" - commissioning a reliable and creative network of seamstresses in the area. Then the outfits got crazier. Once, on the Chris Rock TV show, Benjamin decided to debut an outfit that included American football shoulder pads customised with multiple feather boas and ski-boots. The only problem was he had forgotten the trousers. \"Big Boi dared me to go out and perform on stage in just my underwear. So I did. And it was the most fun.\" </p> <p>But beneath the boas and ski boots, hip-hop's peacockish, dapper rapper was nurturing commercial fashion ambitions. \"And I knew that fur pants and white wigs are not sellable.\" The market is now thick with rap and urban musicians who have tried their hand at (or lent their names to) designing clothing - Justin Timberlake's William Rast, Gwen Stefani's LAMB, Pharrell Williams's Billionaire Boys Club - but Benjamin is determined that Benjamin Bixby (the \"Bixby\" was added for its pleasing alliterative qualities) should develop into a label that might compete with fashion's major players. </p> <p>When he showed his collection in a hotel suite last year, Vogue editor Anna Wintour came to have a look. \"'I can see longevity in this business,' she told me, 'but you have to get with people in business who understand that this is not just an overnight entertainer brand, that you want this business to grow.'\" Benjamin took her advice. He chose not to use the apparently readymade brand name of Andre 3000 (one of several alter egos he has). \"Andre 3000 would be cool if I wanted to do a low-end brand and sell it in Wal-Mart, but this is not a celebrity brand. I am not a fan of celebrity brands, to be honest.\" </p> <p>As well as sketching designs for tweed plus-fours, bomber jackets and waistcoats, he now makes factory visits, has the help of collectors and fashion archivists, and employs a technical director and a vice-president of design. \"I would like to go to fashion school to learn the correct terminology and the correct technique,\" he says. </p> <p>Benjamin seems thrilled at how well the label has been received. The major menswear magazines have featured the line, admiring its quality, detailing and tailoring. And, much to his delight, the other day that perennial rock'n'roll dandy Mick Jagger was spotted taking a picture of the clothes in a window at Barney's New York. \"That,\" says Benjamin, finger-snapping the air with unbridled satisfaction, \"felt pretty good\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 Benjamin Bixby </strong>is available exclusively at Harrods men's designerwear.</p>",
  "<p>On a typically hectic weekend, Hazel Blears accommodates a lecture at Ruskin College, Oxford, a spell of canvassing for a local council byelection in Leeds, complex constituency work, and a family Proms in the Park evening performed by the local BBC Philharmonic Orchestra in her beloved Salford. Then it is back to Leeds again to address an annual conference of not-for-profit organisations - an area close to her heart. She rarely stops. \"I must be mad,\" jokes the secretary of state for communities and local government. \"But I never like letting people down.\"</p> <p>Sadly, there is little time to indulge her passions for dancing and motorcycling, let alone her treasured garden in Salford. She can only dream about long rides on the iconic Italian Ducati motorbike that is currently being modified for her. \"Bespoke,\" she says with a wry smile. \"I am not, shall we say, very tall.\" </p> <p>But at Labour's annual conference this week in Manchester, barely a mile from her constituency office, Blears's political stature is clearly evident as she rounds on the Tories and contrasts their actions on the ground - particularly in London, where, she claims, they are slashing the caring services and grants to voluntary organisations - with the rhetoric of David Cameron, who extols the virtues of channelling more power to communities and embracing the third sector.</p> <p>Actions speak louder than words, she says, and it is about time such double-standards were exposed. \"You either say it and mean it, or you do not,\" she insists. \"People in those [Tory] areas are beginning to see, and experience, the consequences.\"</p> <p>It is hard to escape the impression that such frustration, rarely conceded, is born out of Labour's in-fighting and introspection at the expense of a full-frontal attack on the Tories, and the apparent contradictions at the heart of what policy they have. So much to exploit, yet so much silence.</p> <p>Always quick to attack the circumstances surrounding a string of departures from the newish mayoral regime in London, Blears reveals that Boris Johnson came to see her recently on a courtesy visit before she addressed the leaders of London's councils (only nine of the 34 are now Labour). Only weeks beforehand, she had dismissed the Johnson regime as a shambles. \"We have a very business-like relationship,\" she says diplomatically. \"At the same time, I am keeping a very close eye on what they [the London boroughs] are doing. Social care, help for the elderly, support for the voluntary sector - it's all experienced a huge cut.\"</p> <p>Perhaps more than most senior ministers, Blears is easily misrepresented and categorised as a New Labour zealot. Labelled an \u00fcber-Blairite, and hence considered a long-standing critic of Gordon Brown - wrongly, say her admirers - her politics, in truth, are more easily defined. \"I am basically Labour, certainly not a Marxist,\" she says. \"I come from the bit that is basically working class.\" Born into a Labour family - her dad was a fitter in a bakery and a shop steward in the former Amalgamated Engineering Union - she was educated in Salford and is fiercely proud of its achievements, notably in raising its GCSE standards to above the national average and having the country's best performing primary school.</p> <p>She also played a role in attracting a \"media city\" to the old Manchester docks, repackaged Salford Quays. It will soon be one of the biggest employers in the area, accommodating thousands working in a huge outpost of the BBC and in other production companies.</p> <p>Blears has a simple guiding philosophy, which embraces both her constituency and ministerial work. \"I have an absolute belief in the ability of ordinary working-class people to determine their future and make their own decisions,\" she says. \"I am an activist in the working-class tradition - I have been on the management committee of everything imaginable - and I believe strongly that it's not about well-meaning middle-class people doing good things for working-class people.\"</p> <p>Her much-vaunted empowerment agenda, designed to channel more power to communities and neighbourhoods - assets, in the form of redundant public buildings, \"community kitties\", participatory budgeting and all, underpinned with legislation - neatly puts her Salford experiences into the national context, although some question its practicality. </p> <p>She has just addressed the Local Government Association conference - with the theme of Putting People First - which has explored her new empowerment white paper, Communities in Control. With the questions flowing thick and fast - some supportive, others challenging - she betrays a little frustration, furiously making notes, as one delegate wonders how her grand plans can be put into practice. \"People have told me all my life, 'Hazel it cannot be done,'\" she counters. </p> <p>A questioner wonders if, by empowering some communities - and, by implication, giving them extra resources - others might suffer at the expense of the more powerful. In the tea room later, she expands: \"When we have debates about equity, it's an assumption that everyone gets an equal service. The truth is, the poorest people always get the poorest services because they have not had the clout and the influence. My whole reason for promoting this empowerment agenda is to try to ensure that people who have traditionally not had a say get a better deal, so I am on the side of addressing that balance of power.\"</p> <p>But how? \"First, to dispel the attitude from public service - I don't just mean local government - that somehow those poor people need clever, educated, middle-class people to do the job for them. I have always felt that, if you're not careful, that can be very patronising.</p> <p>\"Actually, the challenge is: how do you open up public service? When you're training doctors, you make sure their listening skills are as good as their talking skills, right? I think, in the past [officialdom] has said: 'These [working-class] groups are hard to reach.' No, they're not! They're hard to reach if you're not prepared to make half the effort. There is a real job to do in going the extra mile.\"</p> <p><strong>Difficult decisions</strong></p> <p>That philosophy is neatly encapsulated in her paper, which states that \"citizens are capable of taking difficult decisions ... balancing competing demands and solving complex problems themselves, given the right support and resources.\" </p> <p>In her weekend lecture at Ruskin, Blears expands further on her theme, with another mild swipe at the well-meaning middle classes \"doing good things for the poor\". Her message? \"It's a completely different social climate now, but working-class tradition has always been about people organising for themselves, mirroring my political approach.\" </p> <p>Her critique extends to the equally well-meaning, if patronising, upper classes - relatively progressive Victorian mill-owners, chocolate magnates and soap barons, for instance, who built model villages around their enterprises, with schools, health centres and libraries. While Blears acknowledges that they did good things - \"a vast improvement on the slums that capitalist landlords created\" - she cannot resist a dig at such \"munificent philanthropy\", which still confined the working classes to relatively primitive surroundings. </p> <p>But Blears is most concerned with how to encourage self-help and community enterprise, under the umbrella of support from the state. As a health minister earlier in the decade, she recalls that a visit to an African-American neighbourhood in Chicago made an impression on her. \"OK, there was no healthcare provided by the state - quite scandalous - but they raised $10m (\u00a35.46m) for a wellbeing centre. They had to because there was no NHS.\" </p> <p><strong>A middle way</strong></p> <p>Her challenge, she says, is to encourage that level of community activism against a backdrop of the state providing health and social care - a social middle way. And she contrasts that philosophy with the reality of the Conservatives under Cameron. Acknowledging that the Tory leader has identified the third sector as an area to exploit, she claims the opposition's new-found enthusiasm for community enterprise and not-for-profit organisations is merely a \"camouflage, a mask\" for deep cuts in the caring services. \"You are on your own - sink or swim.\"</p> <p>Similarly, she has deep misgivings about Cameron's desire to scrap centrally imposed targets and auditing - on housebuilding and service delivery, for instance - in the drive ostensibly to set councils and government agencies free. \"By scrapping those,\" she asks, \"how do you ensure better services for those most in need? Why have government if it is not about the government saying: 'We need more homes, better social care and health?'\"</p> <p>It is a theme she will pursue with a vengeance over the next year and in the run-up to a general election. She believes the fight is far from over, provided the battle is taken to the Tories. But the result will be \"very close\". And she's saying no more for the time being.</p>",
  "<p>At Milan fashion week last night Burberry once again proved that in spirit, if not in terms of factory jobs, it remains British to the core.</p> <p>The relationship between high fashion and bottom-line retail figures is a subtle one. The Burberry check, still much in evidence in stores, has long been absent from designer Christopher Bailey's exceedingly chic catwalk shows. Even the label's signature trenchcoat makes only cameo appearances. </p> <p>Instead, the Burberry catwalk is home to a rarified notion of Britishness. Yesterday's show channelled a bluestocking-at-Sissinghurst kind of Englishwoman: gardening hats and culottes, tea dresses with William Morris-esque floral relief embroidery, and cardigans that did a first-rate impression of hand-me-downs from a chic great-aunt. </p> <p>Gardening hats were jammed down to obscure the models' identity, and a succession of squishy, capacious, she's-leaving-home bags, instead of the perky mini-clutches currently popular on the catwalk, almost suggested grunge. But the soft metallics colour-palette of citrine, bronze and pewter was wistful and dreamy rather than downbeat, as was the music: this season we ended on Love You Til the End by the Pogues. </p> <p>Earlier in the day, the \"icons of glamour, elegance and style\" of \"Nice, Cannes, St Tropez and Cap d'Antibes\" were cited as the inspiration for the D&amp;G collection. This being Milan, the Riviera chic was seen through Milanese eyes, so the Breton stripes came not in boat-neck, long-sleeved T-shirts but in skintight mini-playsuits worn over fishnet tights, while the Chanel-style suits featured hotpants instead of skirts.</p>",
  "<p>Alistair Darling dropped a broad hint yesterday that tax increases or spending restraint would eventually be needed to deal with the surge in public borrowing caused by a slowing economy. The chancellor said he would allow the government's deficit to rise in the short term, to cushion the blow to growth from the credit crunch and higher inflation, but warned that all countries had to \"live within their means\".</p> <p>In a sober analysis of the economic outlook, he said Britain was facing \"real problems\", although he insisted that the underlying strength of the economy was a reason for long-term optimism.</p> <p>The chancellor will use his annual pre-budget report in November to slash Treasury forecasts that growth will be 2% this year and 2.5% next year. He will also raise his forecasts for public borrowing, and outline medium-term plans to bring the public finances back under control.</p> <p>In his keynote speech to the party conference, Darling said he was allowing borrowing to rise during the downturn in order to \"support the economy and families when they need it most\".</p> <p>But with some analysts predicting that the budget deficit could hit \u00a390bn, as Britain suffers its first recession since the early 1990s, he warned that there were tough decisions on tax and spending ahead.</p> <p>\"Make no mistake, discipline in public finances is essential ... In the medium term, governments everywhere have to live within their means, so I will set out this autumn how I will continue to deliver sound public finances.\"</p> <p>Darling is also expected to use his PBR address to acknowledge that the financial turmoil has made it necessary for the government to breach its fiscal rules - to borrow only for investment over the economic cycle and to keep public debt below 40% of GDP.</p> <p>He will use his Mais lecture in the City next month to explain how fiscal policy should respond to financial crises.</p> <p>The chancellor said the global financial system would \"never be the same\" after the turmoil of the year-long crisis. \"These are extraordinary, turbulent times. A crisis which has rocked the financial institutions around the world on top of huge rises in oil, food and commodity prices.\"</p> <p>He said the government had been right to respond to the crisis by taking Northern Rock into public ownership, and by introducing legislation to make it easier to intervene if other banks ran into problems. The Bank of England had been authorised to inject more than \u00a3100bn to help stabilise the UK banking system. \"We are on a difficult road and there will, I am afraid, be bumps along the way. But I will continue to do whatever it takes to maintain financial stability, and I remain confident we will do so.\"</p> <p>The chancellor plans to introduce a new banking bill to the Commons within a fortnight, designed to strengthen supervision and give added powers to financial regulators. He would work with the new chairman of the Financial Services Authority, Lord Turner, to \"review urgently what we need to do to improve the system\".</p> <p>\"It is not a question of light-touch regulation against heavy-handed regulation. It's about effective regulation,\" Darling said. \"I can promise that wherever weaknesses are found in the financial system, whether in the powers of the government, the Bank of England or the FSA, I will take steps to deal with it.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We need to look as well at the culture of huge bonuses which have distorted the way decisions are made. Bonuses should encourage good long-term decisions, not short-term reckless ones.\" The chancellor believes the FSA should use existing powers to clamp down on companies where high bonuses have created incentives for traders to take excessive risks.</p> <p>Over the next few weeks both he and the prime minister would discuss with their international counterparts the measures needed to prevent future \"mistakes and misjudgments\".</p> <p>Inflation, he said, was too high. But the Bank of England believed it would peak soon and should fall over the next year.</p> <p>Ahead of the pre-budget report in the autumn, Darling stressed the need for discipline in public finances, while hailing Labour's record in taking the \"right long-term decisions\" for the economy.</p> <h2>I told you so...</h2> <p>In his speech to the Labour party conference, Alistair Darling referred to his comment in a recent Guardian interview that the global economy was facing its most challenging time in 60 years. At the time, his comments were widely derided as being unduly pessimistic. But that was before last week's banking crisis. \"I've made headlines by saying just how tough times are,\" said the chancellor yesterday. \"I draw little comfort from the fact that many people now understand what I meant.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ministers have promised to review tuition fees for part-time students after acknowledging there is \"inequality\" in the system because part-timers have to pay their fees up front. Bill Rammell, the higher education minister, told a debate on university funding organised by the University and College Union yesterday that part-time student funding would be considered in the review promised for next year. </p> <p>\"It's going to have to answer questions about part-timers,\" he said. \"There is an inequity between adults in the workplace trying to better themselves and the traditional student.\" </p> <p>The review was established as a condition for the introduction of top-up fees in 2006 after a debate in parliament which reduced the government's majority to just five. The review will consider whether to lift the \u00a33,145 cap on fees to create a more varied market in the cost of a university education, amid controversy over the impact of higher fees on the government's attempts to widen access to universities. </p> <p>By law, the review has to happen in 2009, but all political parties are concerned about raising a deeply unpopular issue on the doorstep in the run up to a general election. A poll last week by the UCU suggested that up to two-thirds of voters oppose higher fees. </p> <p>Full-time students in England and Wales only have to pay fees when they earn above a certain threshold, but part-time students have to pay when they sign up for courses. </p> <p>Rammell repeatedly said it was a \"mistake\" in 1998 to scrap the student grant and highlighted the fact that nearly two-thirds of new students this year qualified for some sort of funding. </p> <p>Wes Streeting, president of the National Union of Students, said the government was \"shirking\" an important debate because it feared the political consequences. \"We expect the government to engage properly in a debate about how universities are funded. They can't avoid this because they are worried by voters' opinions. They should listen to voters.\"</p> <p>He welcomed the decision to look again at fees. \"It's critically important that the government revisits part-time students, who have been shamefully overlooked.\"</p>",
  "<p>Does Moore's law now apply to human civilisation? In 1965 Gordon Moore observed that the density of transistors on integrated circuits doubles every two years or so, and predicted this would continue. Similar laws now seem to apply to every aspect of computing. And, perhaps, to the rest of the world. The information available, the scale of human interactions, the detail involved in financial deals and trading relationships and political decisions appear to be growing exponentially. We are drowning in complexity. To be good citizens we must understand what is done in our name. But how?</p> <p>We lean ever more heavily on experts. But who can we now trust? Corporate PR has become so sophisticated that it's almost impossible for most people to tell the difference between genuine science and greenwash, or real grassroots campaigns and the astroturf lobbies concocted by consultants. PR companies set up institutes with impressive names which publish what purport to be scientific papers, sometimes in the font and format of genuine journals. They accuse real scientists of every charge that could be levelled at themselves: junk science, hidden funding, undisclosed interests and inflated credentials. </p> <p>If journalists have any remaining function, it is to help people navigate this world: to try to understand the crushingly dull documents that most people don't have time for, to smoke out the fakes and show how to recognise the genuine article. But we mess up too. The most we can promise is to try not to make the same mistake twice. </p> <p>So what can you say about a man who makes the same mistake 38 times? Who, when confronted by a mountain of evidence demonstrating that his informant is a charlatan convicted under the Trade Descriptions Act, continues to repeat his claims? Who elevates the untested claims of bloggers above peer-reviewed papers? Who sticks to his path through a blizzard of facts? What should we deduce about the Sunday Telegraph's columnist Christopher Booker?</p> <p>This week Richard Wilson's book Don't Get Fooled Again is published. It contains a fascinating chapter on Booker's claims about white asbestos. Since 2002, he has published 38 articles on this topic, and every one of them is wrong. He champions the work of John Bridle, who has described himself as \"the world's foremost authority on asbestos science\". Bridle has claimed to possess an honorary professorship from the Russian Academy of Sciences, to be a consultant to an institute at the University of Glamorgan, the chief asbestos consultant for an asbestos centre in Lisbon, and a consultant to Vale of Glamorgan trading standards department. None of these claims is true. Neither the institute at the University of Glamorgan nor the centre in Lisbon have ever existed. His only relationship with the Glamorgan trading standards department is to have been successfully prosecuted by it for claiming a qualification he does not possess. </p> <p>None of this deters Mr Booker. Armed with Bridle's claims, for the past six years he has waged a campaign against asbestos science. White asbestos cement, he maintains \"poses no measurable risk to health\". He contends that \"not a single case\" of mesothelioma - the cancer caused by exposure to asbestos - \"has ever been scientifically linked with asbestos cement\". A paper commissioned by the UK's Health and Safety Executive, he says, \"concluded that the risk from white asbestos is 'virtually zero'\".</p> <p>Booker tells me he has read this paper. Oh yes? The term he quotes - \"virtually zero\" - does not appear in it. It does show that white asbestos (chrysotile) is less dangerous than brown or blue asbestos. But, while there is uncertainty about the numbers, it still presents a risk of mesothelioma, which depends on the level of exposure. People exposed to a high dose (between 10 and 100 fibres per millilitre per year (f/ml.yr)) have a risk (around two deaths per 100,000 for each f/ml.yr) of contracting this cancer. Only when the dose falls to less than 0.1 f/ml.yr does it become \"probably insignficant\". But Booker's columns contain no such caveat. He creates the impression that white asbestos is safe at all doses. The paper he misquotes also cites five scientific studies of exposure to asbestos cement, which record \"high levels of mesothelioma mortality\". </p> <p>Two years ago, John Bridle's misleading CV and dodgy record were exposed by the BBC's You and Yours programme. So the BBC immediately became part of the conspiracy: in Booker's words \"a concerted move by the powerful 'anti-asbestos lobby' to silence Bridle\". He suggested that the broadcasting regulator Ofcom would clear Bridle's name. In June this year it threw out Bridle's complaint and published evidence even more damning than that contained in the programme. So has Booker changed the way he sees \"Britain's leading practical asbestos expert\"? Far from it. He tells me that \"my view of Ofcom has plummeted\": it too has joined the conspiracy. </p> <p>We are not talking about trivia here. This is a matter of life and death. How many people might have been exposed to dangerous levels of asbestos dust as a result of reading and believing Booker's columns? </p> <p>For several years he has been waging a similar war against \"warmist alarmists\", by which he means climate scientists. Nine days ago, for instance, he attacked Michael Mann for publishing a paper that shows (alongside scores of other studies) that global temperatures do indeed follow the famous hockey-stick pattern: a moderate long-term cooling trend terminating in a sudden upward bend. Mann, Booker told his readers, had been \"selective ... in his new data, excluding anything which confirmed the Medieval Warming\". But Mann's paper, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, uses every uncluttered high-resolution proxy temperature record in the public domain. How did Booker trip up so badly? By using the claims of unqualified bloggers to refute peer-reviewed studies.</p> <p>Under their guidance he routinely mistakes weather for climate and makes claims about the temperature record that bear no relation to the studies he cites. My favourite Booker column is the piece he wrote in February, titled \"So it appears that Arctic ice isn't vanishing after all\". In September 2007, he reported, \"sea ice cover had shrunk to the lowest level ever recorded. But for some reason the warmists are less keen on the latest satellite findings, reported by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ... Its graph of northern hemisphere sea ice area, which shows the ice shrinking from 13,000 million sq km to just 4 million from the start of 2007 to October, also shows it now almost back to 13 million sq km\". To reinforce this point, he helpfully republished the graph, showing that the ice had indeed expanded between September and January. The Sunday Telegraph continues to employ a man who cannot tell the difference between summer and winter. </p> <p>But for the Wikipedia Professor of Gibberish, this patron saint of charlatans, even the seasons are negotiable. Booker remains right, whatever the evidence says. It is hard to think of any journalist - Melanie Phillips included - who has spread more misinformation. The world becomes even harder to navigate. You cannot trust the people who tell you whom to trust.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com\">www.monbiot.com</a></p>",
  "<p>In naturalistic dramatic characters, we look for underlying motivations that provoke decisions and courses of action. To uncover these, we examine characters' outer and inner lives.</p> <p><strong>Outer life</strong></p> <p>A character's \"outer life\" is bound up with social roles and relationships: for example, parent/ child/ sibling; friend/ partner/ spouse; employer/ employee. Complex story worlds create a spectrum of social roles: for example, legal systems offer clusters - law-makers, law-breakers, \"thief-takers\" and victims, the basis for crime or revenge thrillers, heists and capers, murder mysteries and television police or detective series.</p> <p>Written or unwritten rules, expectations and taboos govern roles and relationships, prescribing (or challenging) public and private behaviour, and attributing high or low social status. Roles, relationships and status locate characters within their world, stipulating their everyday interactions. The story events cut across the everyday, generating conflicts within and between characters and situations. </p> <p><strong>For each character, consider:</strong></p> <p>- Sex and gender; race; ethnic origin; age; sexual orientation;.</p> <p>- Class; education; employment; financial circumstances; religion; political affiliation;.</p> <p>- Family and kinship groups; circles of friendship and affinity;</p> <p>- Where on the high or low status axis would each of these categories place him?</p> <p><strong>Inner life</strong></p> <p>The \"inner life\" embraces his psychology (or pathology), emotional condition, and moral impulses. His outer life is his public face; the inner life, his private face. Effective characters experience harmony and conflict between outer and inner, public and private lives. This tension provides the source of his dilemma: the choice between courses of action leading to loss, gain and compromise. </p> <p>Explore a character's internal \"drives\": desire, fear, need, and will. Ask:</p> <p>- What does he want? Why? How badly? How strong is his will to acquire or achieve this?</p> <p>- How far will he go in order to do this? What's stopping him? </p> <p>- What does he fear? How badly? Why? How strong is his will to avoid this?</p> <p>- How far will he go to avoid this? What's stopping him?</p> <p>- What does he need? Why? How badly? </p> <p>- How far will he go? And what, if anything, is stopping him?</p> <p>- Does he know he needs this? If not, why? And what has to happen to make him recognise it?</p> <p>Create points of conflict between his desires, needs and fears: for example, to get what he needs, he'll have to face his worst fear; what he wants is the opposite of what he really needs. When need amplifies fear or desire, it raises the stakes.</p> <p>A character lives in the present, but his past - his \"backstory\" - may dictate his emotional terrain and influence his actions. Strengths and weaknesses often lie there, providing 'ghosts' (people, events) to haunt his present life. Root his present dilemma in the secrets, illusions or self-deceptions in his backstory.</p> <p><strong>Characterisation</strong></p> <p>Characters' outer and inner lives are revealed through:</p> <p>- Physical type, body language and gesture: give each character a \"tell\" - a definitive, revealing gesture or movement.</p> <p>- Costume and hair.</p> <p>- Settings, particularly private spaces: think about how the objects, colours, sounds and textures reflect the character.</p> <p>- Dialogue: how the character speaks, and what he speaks about.</p> <p>- Actions: the decisions the character makes and carries out. </p> <p>Pixar's film WALL.E is an excellent case study in character creation and characterisation: the central characters are anthropomorphised machines. Though their dialogue is mostly squeaks, beeps and chirps, the communication is clear, and thoroughly rooted in character.</p> <p><strong>Character functions</strong></p> <p>The protagonist is the character who makes the most active decisions. The dramatic story tracks his progress, and may follow his point of view. He's not necessarily pleasant or good, but he is the character in whom we are invited to invest. Each character should have their own story, but the protagonist's should be the strongest. </p> <p>The next strongest story belongs to the antagonist, generating conflict by disrupting and blocking the protagonist's progress. She is the force for change within the story. She must be capable of defeating - even destroying - him; if she's under-developed, the story collapses. Build her outer and inner life, and backstory. Use their desires, fears and needs to set them in irreconcilable opposition.</p> <p>The protagonist may be a single character, a pair (love stories), or a group (for example, This Life). The antagonist may be any of the following: </p> <p>- A character </p> <p>- An opposing force, such as societal attitudes or changes </p> <p>- Nature (the Asian tsunami, The Birds) </p> <p>- Supernatural forces, or aliens</p> <p>- Technology (HAL 9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey)</p> <p>- The protagonist can also be his own antagonist (Tom Ripley in The Talented Mr Ripley). </p> <p>These characters require allies and opponents to flesh out the main story. These secondary characters can change sides or allegiances to help you create obstacles, setbacks and triumphs for your principals.</p>",
  "<p>Two advisers to John McCain's presidential campaign today said a flood of questionable voter registration applications in swing states threatens to undermine the accuracy of the November election and could prevent legitimate voters from registering for a ballot.</p> <p>The warning came less than a week after the Democratic party filed a lawsuit in Michigan seeking to end what its lawyers said were Republican efforts to suppress votes of poor people and African Americans, two historically Democratic constituencies. The move indicates the Democratic and Republican parties are set to battle over voter registration in the remaining weeks of the campaign.</p> <p>On a conference call with reporters this afternoon, former Republican senators John Danforth and Warren Rudman said a coalition of community organisations called Acorn had in several states submitted voter registration applications for people who were already registered. </p> <p>The senators did not accuse the group of fraud, but suggested the group's registration drive was \"diluting\" legitimate votes and causing havoc in the nation's voter registration process.</p> <p>\"Our mission is to ensure that everybody who is entitled to vote gets to vote without any intimidation but also that there's no stuffing of the ballot boxes, no fraudulent voting and also that the rules are the same for everybody,\" said Danforth, a former Missouri senator. </p> <p>\"We are concerned that there is or may be a pattern of registering people who are not entitled to vote or otherwise gumming up the system for registering voters.\"</p> <p>He cited news reports in Michigan, Colorado and elsewhere describing problematic registration applications surfacing after large Acorn registration drives. Earlier this month in Detroit, for example, the secretary of state's office cited a \"sizeable number of duplicate and fraudulent applications\" arising from an Acorn drive. </p> <p>Last week, Republican officials called Acorn's North Carolina chapter \"a quasi-criminal, Democratic affiliated organisation\" after an election official asked the state to check 80 applications submitted by the group.</p> <p>Today, Danforth sought to link Acorn to the Obama camp, noting that a political action committee affiliated with Acorn endorsed Obama.</p> <p>He also said the McCain campaign was concerned that some ballot stations in heavily Democratic areas would be allowed to remain open on election night after their scheduled closing. </p> <p>State laws typically allow that anyone on line to vote when the polls are scheduled to close may cast a ballot, but Danforth said he was concerned polling sites would be kept open to accommodate Democrats' late voter turnout efforts.</p> <p>Rudman defended the party against Democratic allegations in Michigan that Republicans are working to deny the vote to people who lost their homes in the mortgage crisis. </p> <p>The Democratic party said its lawsuit filed last week in Michigan was aimed at ceasing the practice. The suit came after a Macomb county Republican official told a local newspaper the party was culling voter names from foreclosure lists to challenge their residency.</p> <p>Rudman said the suit was a \"red herring\", and that, \"all the local officials deny it\". He called on the Democratic party to come to an accord with the Republicans on election-day procedures such as extended polling hours.</p> <p>The back-and-forth between the Democratic and Republican parties reflects the historic divergence between the two camps on voter registration and ballot access. The Republican party has typically pushed for strong verification requirements, such as identification checks at the ballot, measures they say are intended to counter voter fraud. </p> <p>The Democrats, meanwhile, say such strictures will discourage the elderly and poor from voting. Non-partisan election experts say there is minimal fraud in US voting.</p>",
  "<p>A top adviser to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a> took a dig at the New York Times' credibility today, calling the paper \"a pro-Obama advocacy organisation\" when discussing a news story linking the candidate's campaign manager to a lobbying operation backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</p> <p>The Times reported this morning that Rick Davis, who heads day-to-day operations for McCain, was paid more than $30,000 a month during a five-year period when he represented a group seeking to limit government regulation of Fannie and Freddie. Such regulation has become a key issue for both McCain and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobamacrisis\">Barack Obama</a> as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/wallstreet\">crisis on Wall Street</a> dominates the news.</p> <p>In response to a question from CNN reporter Dana Bash regarding the Davis story, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/31/uselections2008.barackobama\">Steve Schmidt </a> said: \"Whatever the New York Times once was, it is today not by any standard a journalistic organisation, it is a pro-Obama advocacy organisation that every day attacks the McCain campaign, attacks Senator McCain, attacks Governor Palin and excuses Senator Obama.</p> <p>\"There is no level of public vetting with regard to Senator Obama's record, his background, his past statements. There is no level of outrage directed at his deceitful ads. This is an organisation that is completely, totally, 150% in the tank for the Democrat candidate.\"</p> <p>The New York Times' executive editor, Bill Keller, issued a statement in response, reading: \"The New York Times is committed to covering the candidates fully, fairly and aggressively ... Candidates and their campaign operatives are not always comfortable with that level of scrutiny, but it's what our readers expect and deserve.\"</p> <p>Democratic spokesmen declined to comment on Schmidt's remarks, but the Obama campaign this afternoon distributed a memo listing New York Times pieces it considers critical of the Democratic presidential nominee, including accounts of his relationships with Chicago political figures, his investments and his Illinois state senate voting record.</p> <p>At the Republican National Convention in St Paul earlier this month, several featured speakers, including McCain's primary rival Mike Huckabee, pointedly criticised the media in attacks cheered by delegates.</p> <p>During the question-and-answer period at a McCain rally today in Scranton, Pennsylvania, a McCain supporter asked why news organizations had committed so many reporters to investigate the background of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a>, McCain's running mate.</p> <p>\"Shame on you, shame on you,\" the woman shouted to applause, according to an Associated Press report.</p> <p>The New York Times endorsed McCain for the Republican nomination during the primary season, praising him as \"the only Republican who promises to end the George Bush style of governing from and on behalf of a small, angry fringe \u2026 [with] a record of working across the aisle to develop sound bipartisan legislation\". The newspaper endorsed Obama's rival Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. It has yet to endorse a candidate in the general election.</p>",
  "<p>The delegates and activists who gathered in Manchester Town Hall were aware that the coming election was going to be painfully close. But they also sensed that a historic victory was possible. </p> <p>Sadly for them, the election in question is being held in the United States. The purpose of yesterday evening's <a href=\"http://fabians.org.uk/\">Fabian Society</a>-organised fringe event was to explore what lessons Labour could learn from America and to ask whether \"hope can win\". </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.davidlammy.co.uk/da/12244\">David Lammy</a> began by stating of the official government line of neutrality before discussing the parallels between Labour and the Democrats. He argued that \"What works was what mattered\" had been at the heart of New Labour's mantra, \"but what is becoming is clear is that now it is not about what works, it's about what matters\".</p> <p>He offered climate change, abortion, the role of government and foreign policy as themes that now matter.</p> <p>Peter Kellner from <a href=\"http://www.yougov.com/uk/panel/\">YouGov</a> then posed the question: what are we actually arguing about in British politics? In the US, he noted, there are strong and vibrant disagreements between the parties and their supporters. \"There is a fissure between American voters on values issues like abortion, gun control and so on but should there be such a cleavage in British politics to replace the ideological conflicts of the twentieth century? Or should we carry on with the broadly centrist view that Labour and the Conservatives do not radically disagree with each other? If we are going to have something to argue about and it's not going to be economic ideology what is it going to be about?\"</p> <p>It was an intriguing question that was sadly left unexplored by the other speakers. Instead both Newsweek journalist Stryker Maguire, Labour prospective candidate Rushanara Ali and Bill Barnard from Democrats Abroad UK talked about the fact that the coming presidential election would represent an unprecedented leap for both black people and women in politics. </p> <p>Listening to the discussion it struck me that while there had been a huge amount of time devoted to discussing politics there was virtually no reference to the personalities of the candidates. And yet among the most striking aspects to the presidential race \u2013 and one of reasons why it has ignited such interest abroad \u2013 is that McCain, Obama and, love her or loathe her, Palin, all have compelling personal biographies which are surely part of their appeal. </p> <p>Is it McCain's policies that voters are responding to or the fact that he embodies the all-American hero? Is it not Obama's articulation of being at ease in his mixed race American skin that partly explain his appeal and, similarly, Palin's popularity is also partly derived from her claim to be just another working hockey mom. </p> <p>There is, of course, a presidential system in the US which will inevitably focus more on individuals than the parliamentary system. When I asked the panel for their thoughts about the role of personality in politics, Kellner argued that the problems facing Labour are bigger than Gordon Brown and that changing the leader would not change their fortunes. </p> <p>For him it's the policies, stupid. Perhaps. And yet while it may be true that ditching Brown now will not save Labour perhaps the lesson for the future, a lesson drawn from across the Atlantic, is that politics is not only about the message but also the messenger.</p>",
  "<p>Are you a middle-aged man with a deep baritone voice who looks a bit like John Goodman and likes creeping around your local forest, dressed in camouflage gear, wearing a bright orange hat and carrying a gun, pretending that you are a professional sniper when really you're not, and never will be?

According to this ad \u2014 part of a series just released by the National Rifle Association \u2014&#xa0;the notoriously elitist community organiser wants to ban \"the shotguns and rifles most of us use for hunting\".

But given that we'll all soon be living in a post-capitalist anarcho-socialist society, scavenging for food and forced to use survivalist skills to protect small stashes of food and valuables from marauding gangs of fired investment bankers, there's probably no harm in erring on the safe side.

  "<p>The more I think about it and chat with others, the trickier the politics of the bailout vote gets for Obama. But here's an idea a wise lunch mate offered.</p> <p>Background: It's obvious McCain would love to vote against the bailout. It gives him separation from Bush. It lets him demagogue on and on about how he's not going to let the fat cats off the hook and stick the little people with the bill. </p> <p>McCain is the most prominent Republican in that position, but he's hardly the only one. Many of them would relish an opportunity to go back to their voters and say they stood up to a president with a 28% approval rating (never mind that they did everything he asked for 7.65 years). So lots of Republicans would presumably like a chance to vote against the bailout--also, to be fair, on anti-big-government philosophical grounds as well as political ones.</p> <p>So, says my lunch partner: Let them. Reid and Pelosi should force a vote on the naked Paulson bill, with no Democratic attachments. The presumption is that this would fail by a reasonably comfortable margin. Then hold a vote on a compromise that meets many of Democrats' conditions, and many of both candidates' conditions. Obama votes for. </p> <p>Now what does McCain do? A, he votes for. The pressure will be intense for him to do so, on substantive grounds. But in this case he has no political issue. B, he votes against, but at this point he's one of relatively few votes against, and now he's stuck railing against a bill that passed with bipartisan support and that nearly every noted economist and financial expert said was necessary. In this case, Obama can say, one of us made the tough call and is ready to lead, and the other one chose to sit in the back of the class and throw spitballs.</p> <p>I think that sounds like a winner, but things are awfully fluid. If I change my mind, or if someone else changes it for me, I'll get back to you.<br></p>",
  "<p>Sarah Palin has thrown herself into a 36-hour crash course in foreign diplomacy as she makes a highly-publicised visit to the UN in New York this week in an attempt to shrug off the perception that she is an international affairs ing\u00e9nue.</p> <p>The Republican vice-presidential candidate, who obtained a passport to travel outside North America for the first time only last year, is meeting a raft of leaders from several of the world's current hotspots.</p> <p>But her cramming timetable fails to include any scheduled encounter with a major European leader.</p> <p>Her induction begins tonight with attendance at a cocktail party held by President George Bush at the city's Waldorf-Astoria hotel. </p> <p>Lebanese president Michel Suleiman and other leaders, carefully selected for their goodwill towards America, were on the guest list.</p> <p>Even before Palin takes her first steps tomorrow morning into the UN's international territory on the east side of Manhattan, she has walked into controversy. </p> <p>She had been billed to make an appearance at a rally outside the UN building organised by New York Jewish groups protesting the arrival of the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, at the annual UN general assembly.</p> <p>But Palin's invitation was withdrawn by organisers following a public spat with Hillary Clinton. The senator for New York had accepted a previous offer to attend but pulled out complaining that Palin's late inclusion on the speaker list would have politicised the event.</p> <p>The New York Sun today published the speech that Palin would have made had she appeared at the rally. In it, she calls for action to thwart Ahmadinejad who she says should be held accountable under international law for the crime of inciting genocide.</p> <p>\"He must be stopped,\" the speech says.</p> <p>Since her appointment as John McCain's presidential running mate last month, Palin has faced stiff criticism, and even ridicule, for her lack of international experience. Democratic opponents have pointed out that she is just one heartbeat away from taking over the US presidency herself should McCain fall ill in office.</p> <p>The McCain campaign unwittingly fanned the flames of the criticism by emphasising that as governor of Alaska she was knowledgeable about neighbouring Russia. </p> <p>The theme was picked up in a Saturday Night Live spoof in which Tina Fey as Palin says: \"I can see Russia from my house\".</p> <p>Bloggers have also gone to town on her the moment in a television interview when she was flummoxed by a reference to the \"Bush doctrine\", the argument that pre-emptive strikes against threatening states or terrorist groups can be justified.</p> <p>The main work of dispelling the impression of naivety will begin tomorrow morning when Palin enters the gladiatorial ring of the UN. In a succession of meetings that will continue into Wednesday, she will meet leaders from many of the most sensitive regions of the world.</p> <p>But according to the list put out by Reuters, there will be no western European leaders among her engagements. It has been confirmed that the British government has neither been approached by the Palin team, nor sought any contact with it.</p> <p>The only UK minister she could meet casually is Kim Howells, the junior foreign office minister, who will attend the Bush cocktail party.</p> <p>She will meet the presidents of Afghanistan and Iraq, Hamid Karzai and Jalal Talabani, in recognition of the two wars the US is engaged in, as well as the leader of the main US ally in Latin America, Alvaro Uribe of Colombia. The new Pakistani president Asif Ali Zardari is on the list, as is the Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh.</p> <p>There is no seat at the Palin table for China or notably Russia following the conflict in Georgia, though the presidents of Georgia itself, Mikheil Saakashvili , and Ukraine, Viktor Yushchenko, are included.</p> <p>Peter Beinart, senior fellow of the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, said the cast was unsurprising for the deputy of McCain.</p> <p>\"These are all leaders of countries considered friendly to the US. McCain is a more Us-versus-Them kind of guy than Obama, and you can see that reflected on the list.\"</p> <p>The other interesting entry on the list is Henry Kissinger, who Palin will meet tomorrow. The former US secretary of state under Richard Nixon was once highly divisive, but now occupies a lofty position as elder statesman and has been frequently consulted by Bush.</p>",
  "<p>At an impressive 5'7\", would-be model <a href=\"http://www.cwtv.com/thecw/gen-gallery-antm11-models/6/5\">Isis Tsunami</a> fits right in with her fellow contestants on the 11th series of America's Next Top Model, due to start on UK television tonight (Living, 9pm). With her tiny waist and endless legs, there is nothing that sets her apart from the 13 other equally beautiful <a href=\"http://www.cwtv.com/thecw/americas-next-top-model11-biohub\">contestants</a>. However, there is a difference, as imperceptible as it may be: Isis was born a man. </p> <p>At 22, she is a pre-op transsexual, the first of whom has appeared on the hit show. Her inclusion has prompted both ridicule and praise across the US. Fox News anchor Gregg Jarrett openly laughed during his <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/fashion/2008/08/fox_news_addresses_isis_tsunam.html\">reportage</a> on Isis while switching between male and female pronouns. He relayed Isis's description of herself as a woman whose \"cards were dealt differently\", before adding, \"Boy, that's an understatement!\" and then going on to discuss her genitalia.</p> <p>Isis's fellow contestants have also taken exception to her situation. Some admitted that she would not be received well in their local communities, while others pejoratively referred to her as \"he/she\" and a \"drag queen\". Isis does find some support among the other girls as one helps distract her during a painful hormone injection.</p> <p>Meanwhile, US media and transgender groups have turned Isis into a cause. Newsweek's Joshua Alston <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/id/159390/\">wonders</a> if Isis will help usher in a new age of understanding, while online magazine Jezebel <a href=\"http://jezebel.com/5051763/can-antms-isis-do-for-transgender-americans-what-will--jack-did-for-gay-men\">asks</a>, \"Can Isis do for transgender Americans what Will &amp; Jack did for gay men?\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://glaad.org/\">Glaad</a> (Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) applauded the decision to cast Isis in the show. Rather than an exploitative publicity stunt, Isis's inclusion was <a href=\"http://www.usmagazine.com/transgender-contestant-to-compete-on-antm\">lauded</a> by Gladd president Neil Giuliano as \"an unprecedented opportunity for a community that is underrepresented on television.\" He continues: \"We applaud Tyra Banks and The CW [Television Network] for making this historic visibility of transgender people possible.\"</p> <p>And what does Isis say of all this? \"I like to help people, but I'm here to follow my dreams,\" she <a href=\"http://www.usmagazine.com/transgender-contestant-to-compete-on-antm\">tells</a> Us Weekly. Rather than redefining our attitudes toward transgender communities or posing as a poster child for a cause, Isis wants to focus on her goal of becoming a top fashion model.</p> <p>The show's producers <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/Story?id=5629177&amp;page=1\">say</a> they were unaware of Isis's background when they decided to cast her in the series. Perhaps it is naive to believe them, but put aside any underhand intentions and the person at the centre of the storm is just a young girl chasing a dream. Is it fair to assign her the responsibility of representing an entire community? Is it her job to be a spokesperson for transgender people across America? When a person is different, they should be accepted for who they are in their own right rather than held up for their differences.</p> <p>If Isis wins the competition, it should be because she is good at what she does \u2013 not because she has shouldered a burden or broken a barrier. It is true that in some cases, a person's difference is what makes them remarkable, but we should not lose sight of everything else that makes them special. Take Barack Obama, for example: as America's first black presidential candidate from a major party, he is already making history, but I hope that in four or maybe even eight years' time, rather than saying \"He was America's first black president\", the world's media will say \"He was one of America's greatest presidents.\" Maybe the media will be able to praise him, and everyone else who is \"different\", for what they do rather than what they are. After all, most people don't want to be examples. They want to be people.</p>",

Meanwhile at <strong>Moschino Cheap and Chic</strong> - soldiering bravely on in their attempts to redefine the word \"cheap\" - there was embellishment galore. Striped jackets over oversized dresses in floral prints sashayed down the catwalk, accompanied by <a href=\"http://www.hellomagazine.com/photo-galleries.html?imagen=/fashion/2008/09/22/armani-cavalli-milan/imgs/moschino-1a.jpg\">deconstructed straw boaters</a>. But at<strong> Gianfranco Ferre</strong> the mood was much more sombre.

Today, <strong>Hogan</strong> showcased their new collection against the backdrop of a marvellously random cartoon, featuring characters named Paulina and.. well I can't remember the others but the English one appeared to live in a luxury penthouse in the Millennium Dome. The bags were printed in a new technique that makes leather appear metallic and had a hippy, relaxed vibe, while the shoes ranged from beautifully simple to bling-encrusted yoga shoes that Madonna might well wear in her private studio, should she have such a thing.</p> <p>The <strong>Fay</strong> presentation was in the wonderful surroundings of the Palazzo Reale and was more art installation than fashion presentation. Included were some exclusive styles designed by Giles Deacon - and the designer himself was there.

  "<p>Last year's <a href=\"http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=515\">Women's No Pay Day</a> was held on October 30. This is the point at which, in accordance with the 17% average pay gap between the genders, women cease to earn for the year compared with their male colleagues. And this year's Women's No Pay Day, as the <a href=\"http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/\">Fawcett Society</a>'s Katherine Rake noted ruefully at a Women in Journalism fringe this morning, will also be held on October 30. Another year on, and wage discrimination remains resolutely intractable.</p> <p>As Rake also argues, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jun/26/gender.equality\">forthcoming equality bill</a> provides a once-in-a-generation opportunity to remedy this. Already, aspects of the new legislation are cause for approval, if not outright celebration. Public authorities will have to declare their pay gap and, in the private sector, secrecy clauses that prevent colleagues discussing their salaries will be banned.</p> <p>But the measure which many activists believe could be the most significant in targeting pay inequality is absent from the draft bill \u2013 pay audits, legally requiring organisations to undertake regular comparison of their employees' pay and to take action to redress discrepancies. In a discussion led by the redoubtable equality campaigner Vera Baird MP QC, it was concluded that legislative change alone was not enough. Pay inequality is also about expectation, or rather lack of it. Where flexible hours are still considered a concession to, rather than an essential accommodation of, family life, women are likely to feel grateful rather than militant about their diminished remuneration.</p> <p>Likewise, we know that a significant pay gap emerges among gradates within years of leaving university, and that women of all ages are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2006/jan/18/workandcareers.g2\">less likely</a> to ask for a pay rise than men. Perhaps it's time we trained our young women in the negotiation skills required to assert themselves in the workplace. (Though I'm not holding out much hope, since we're still struggling to provide school children with the very basics of sex education.)</p> <p>Baird mentioned at the beginning of the event that a commitment to wage equality appeared as early as 1950, in Churchill's post-war Tory manifesto. As the pollster Deborah Mattinson <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/21/labourconference.labour\">warns</a> that Labour is haemorrhaging women voters, the equality bill offers a glaringly obvious opportunity to regain their attention.</p>",
  "<p>The concept of a Wall Street investment bank was in its death throes today as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/morganstanley\">Morgan Stanley</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/goldmansachs\">Goldman Sachs</a> succumbed to a collapse in confidence in their financial stability by converting themselves into lower risk, tightly regulated commercial banks.</p> <p>Beset by plunging share prices and alarmed by the demise of competitors, the two remaining standalone Wall Street banks accepted licences from the Federal Reserve which allow them to take deposits from the public backed by federal government guarantees.</p> <p>While safeguarding customers' money, the change will radically restrict the firms' activities by imposing strict regulatory limits on the risks their traders can take on the markets and on the amount of money they can borrow. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley further shored up its financial position by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/22/wallstreet.morganstanley\">selling a stake of up to 20% in itself to Japan's Mitsubishi Financial Group</a> for an estimated $8bn to $9bn.</p> <p>Against a backdrop of an ongoing global financial crisis, the hurriedly agreed change in the two US banks' status happened without the usual 30-day waiting period for such applications. It came as Congress began scouring legislation to enact a $700bn government bail-out for banks through the creation of a state-sponsored body to suck up toxic, underperforming mortgage-backed assets.</p> <p>Goldman Sachs' chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, said his firm would be viewed as an \"even more secure institution\" under the new regime while Morgan Stanley's boss John Mack said it offered \"certainty about the strength of our financial position and our access to funding\".</p> <p>Only last week, both firms were vigorously defending the viability of their business models in spite of a sell-off which sent their stock plunging by 20% to 30% on consecutive days.</p> <p>They insist that unlike rivals such as Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, they are profitable and suffering few financial problems. But insiders accept that the landscape has changed - once source said: \"Given the events of the last few months, particularly the last week, it's become very clear that the market places a premium on safety and certainty.\"</p> <p>The conversions end a chapter in US banking history which opened in 1933 when the Glass-Steagall act separated investment banking from high-street banking. Bill Isaac, a former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said it was the end of Wall Street banking as we know it.</p> <p>\"They're the only two left and the handwriting was on the wall,\" said Isaac. \"It's a shame because this country was built, in part, on risk-taking by Goldman and Morgan and by a whole bunch of firms before them.\"</p> <p>Analysts say the banks' new status will limit their ability to dabble in the types of exotic derivatives and credit instruments which contributed to the credit crunch. Banks' risks are generally judged by a leverage ratio of assets to borrowing. Morgan Stanley's ratio reached 33 last year and Goldman Sachs' touched 28 while high-street banks are typically in the low teens or below.</p> <p>David Williams, an analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton in New York, said: \"The regulatory tide is moving against the investment banks. There are going to be higher levels of regulation, lower leverage ratios, greater scrutiny on what they do.\"</p> <p>Neither Goldman nor Morgan Stanley has immediate plans to open networks of high-street branches. Morgan Stanley already has about 300 branch offices and is expected to offer a broader range of services at the counter. </p> <p>Goldman intends to bid for deposits on a wholesale basis - for example, by stepping in to become custodian when local banks struggle in the US.</p> <p>Between them, the banks hold about $56bn of customers' deposits in their wealth management businesses for rich private clients which, as of today, are guaranteed by taxpayers' money.</p> <p>Bear Stearns' collapse in March was the beginning of the end for Wall Street's \"big five\" standalone investment banks. Lehman Brothers went bankrupt last week, although its US operation re-opened yesterday under Barclays' ownership. Merrill Lynch is set to be swallowed through a $50bn buyout by Bank of America.</p> <p>Alarmed by the speed of the industry's unravelling, the Bush administration is pushing for swift legislation on a $700bn bail-out plan. Democrats in Congress are fighting to insert measures in which would give the government a stake in banks benefiting from aid and would cap executive pay.</p> <p>Critics of the industry say the money ought to be used to help homeowners in danger of losing their houses. Bruce Marks, chief executive of the Neighbourhood Assistance Corporation of America, said: \"We are rewarding companies whose only motivation was greed. This is truly moral hazard bearing its ugly head.\"</p> <p>During early trading, Wall Street stocks were sharply down with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing as much as 200 points. </p>",
  "<p>Cherie Booth clashed with Jack Straw at a Labour fringe event today when the two sought to blame each other's professions for weaknesses in the criminal justice system.</p> <p>The justice secretary and the wife of former prime minister Tony Blair differed in their analysis of why George Michael, the singer, had been let off with a caution when he had been caught in possession of crack cocaine, something Sun columnist Jane Moore said made the public question the justice system.</p> <p>Straw said: \"There are still some decisions, like in Mr Michael's case, where you think, 'How did they [judges] come up with that?'\" </p> <p>Booth, a QC, said: \"Speaking as a judge, you could say that about some of the decisions politicians take.\"</p> <p>They were debating at the Sun's first ever fringe meeting at a Labour conference. </p> <p>The last time Booth appeared at a Labour conference in Manchester, she was reported to have muttered \"Well, that's a lie\" during a speech by Brown in which he praised her husband. Though she has always denied the remarks, she referred to them yesterday when asked what she thought of Brown's political health.</p> <p>She said: \"Two years ago there were some things expressed about what I was supposed to have said and I can assure you I am not going to go into that trap.\"</p> <p>Alongside Booth and Straw, Charles Clarke, shadow education secretary Michael Gove and Keith Bristow, the chief constable of Warwickshire police, also appeared on the Sun's panel, under the banner of its \"let's fix Britain together\" campaign.<br> But, of the Sun's panellists, only Michael Gove agreed that Britain was broken. The Sun has recently attempted to build a cross-party publicity campaign around issues of knife and gun crime, but this theme has been a key part of Conservative ideology for 18 months. </p> <p>Yesterday the panellists also clashed over the Conservative assertion that single-parent families contributed to the broken society. Straw said he was raised by a single mother with five siblings in a maisonette and pointed to his own career as proof the Tories' analysis was wrong.</p> <p>Gove, who was raised by adoptive parents, said Straw had no idea how he, Gove, had been raised. </p> <p>Booth said: \"It looks like nobody on this panel has actually had two parents.</p> <p>\"I think you need to have a positive male role model but I don't think that always means they always have to be people in the same house. They can be from school, community workers, even prison officers.\"</p> <p>Gove said a future Conservative government would implement measures brought in by Rudy Giuliani in New York where he called for street-by-street reports on crime levels.</p>",
  "<p>The message of the suicide bombers responsible for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/22/pakistan.terrorism\">devastating assault</a> on the Marriott hotel in the heart of Islamabad on Saturday, which reduced the 290-room hotel to a skeleton and left 53 people dead, was simple and chilling.</p> <p>\"We are powerful enough to attack any target we choose, and will do so until the Pakistani government stops its military strikes in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) and elsewhere.\"</p> <p>The most audacious terrorist atrocity in the Pakistani capital \u2013 widely described as \"Pakistan's 9/11\" \u2013 has given added significance to the meeting that President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan will have with President George Bush on Tuesday at the United Nations in New York. </p> <p>Bush will likely highlight the latest bombing to stress that the resurgent Taliban and al-Qaida are a growing threat not only to Afghanistan but also to Pakistan, and that the Zardari government must redouble its effort to crush them by destroying their bases in Fata and the Swat Valley in the North West Frontier Province.</p> <p>Zardari will have little choice but to agree with Bush, whose government is providing more than $1bn a year in military and economic aid to Pakistan. </p> <p>But pro-American, secular Zardari faces a Herculean task. Anti-Americanism is rife in Pakistan, and exists not only among ordinary citizens but also the ranks of the security forces, from the regular army to paramilitary Frontier Corps and police. </p> <p>To most Pakistanis, the military strikes against the Islamist militants in Fata and the Swat Valley, 100 miles north of Islamabad, are tantamount to \"Muslims killing Muslims\" for the sake of America. They believe that under the guise of conducting \"war on terror\", Bush is waging \"war on Islam\". The two countries he has invaded so far, Afghanistan and Iraq, are almost wholly Muslim, they say. </p> <p>Despite that fact that North Korea, a member of Bush's \"Axis of Evil\", tested an atom bomb, and that its leader, Kim Jong Il, is a tyrant, responsible for deaths of an estimated 2 million people due to the famine caused by his policies, Bush has not attacked North Korea. Why? Because North Korea is not a Muslim nation, most Pakistanis maintain. </p> <p>Against this backcloth of rampant anti-Americanism, Zardari needs to devise a strategy that allows him to distance his government from the United States and repress Islamist extremists on a nationalist agenda of maintaining law and order and the territorial integrity of Pakistan. Still, such a strategy would need to be underwritten by regional powers. </p> <p>Zardari is reported to have drafted such a plan. It envisages the convening of the representatives of Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, India, China, and Russia to discuss the burgeoning threat of Islamist terrorism, and formulate a common, cooperative strategy. At that gathering America and Britain will be present, but only as observers. </p> <p>\"A consensus [of the regional states] is necessary so that the war on terror is not considered an American war but is owned by all countries,\" the Zardari position paper states. </p> <p>Whatever the merits of the Zardari plan, which are considerable, it is unlikely to appeal to Bush. The last thing Bush wants is to see the US downgraded to a bit-player in the armed onslaught on Islamist radicals. He is embarrassingly aware of his bravado statement about Osama bin Laden after 9/11: \"We'll get him, dead or alive\". </p> <p>Anxious to catch or capture Bin Laden, widely believed to be ensconced in Fata, before he leaves the White House in January 2009, Bush will pressurise Zardari to intensify military attacks in Fata while keeping intact his secret authorisation to the Pentagon's Special Operations Forces, stationed in Afghanistan, to enter Fata without even informing Pakistan to kill or capture the \"bad guys\". </p> <p>Such acts will undermine the legitimacy of the Zardari government, alienate Pakistan's military high command, and feed anti-American feelings among ordinary Pakistanis. But by then a retired Bush will be busily cutting brush at his ranch in Crawford, Texas.</p>",
  "<p>One of the great political biographies of the last 20 years is Roy Jenkins' <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Gladstone-Roy-Jenkins/dp/0333662091\">Gladstone</a>. What makes it so specially enjoyable is the sense throughout that Jenkins is conducting a conversation with his subject on the nature of political power.</p> <p>Exploring the present is one of history's most enjoyable purposes. So this afternoon's Guardian fringe at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourconference\">Labour conference in Manchester</a> to decide the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/politicalheroes\">party's greatest hero</a> was always going to be about who should really be leading Labour now. </p> <p>The shortlist of four, drawn up by Labour MPs, was Labour's first MP <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/19/labour.labourconference1\">Keir Hardie</a>, its first prime minister of a majority government, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/19/labour.labourconference\">Clement Attlee</a>, its greatest woman politician so far, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/19/labourconference.labour\">Barbara Castle</a> and the founder of the NHS <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/19/labour.labourconference2\">Nye Bevan</a>. Bevan's champion was Ed Balls, Gordon Brown's closest ally.</p> <p>During conversations when I was <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Red-Queen-Authorised-Biography-Barbara/dp/0330486411\">writing her biography</a>, Castle always insisted that the first question any politician should ask of another was, \"what did he mean by that?\" So what were we to read into the decision of the leading Brownite Ed Balls to argue the case for the legendary Labour schismatic, Aneurin Bevan? </p> <p>Bevan has long stood for everything that is most inspiring about Labour. A South Wales miner who left school at 13, whose first taste of political power was organising during the 1926 General strike and the miners' strike that lasted long after it, Nye Bevan was a radical visionary in the 1930s, a courageous thorn in Churchill's side in the 1940s and of course ultimately father of the NHS. </p> <p>But he was also the politician, in the late 1940s when, just as in the late 1920s and again in the 1960s, the Labour government fell apart under the pressures of extreme economic events, who was at the head of a band of what the leadership saw as schismatic die-hards. </p> <p>They refused to accept that rearmament was more important than the NHS, and later consolidated round opposition to the Atlanticism of the Labour leadership in what was partly a very personal battle between the great romantic son of the valleys and Hugh Gaitskell, the man he once branded a \"dessicated calculating machine\".</p> <p>Balls had to defend his hero against David Blunkett (supporting Attlee), who branded him a quitter, arguing that the odd moment of misplaced passion should not discredit him: </p> <p>But at the very end of a career truncated by early death, Bevan recanted: he accepted nuclear weapons and prepared for a role as foreign secretary. And what attracted Balls, we learned, was not Bevan's oratory or his passion but his understanding that without power, there was no purpose in politics. There have to be limits to radicalism. It was Bevan who said the \"religion of socialism is the language of priorities\". </p> <p>It is not hard to imagine that where Balls said Bevan, we might also discern a lightly disguised reference to Brown. And when he asserted that Bevan had never been a Bevanite, and in fact had been embarrassed by the misplaced passion of his supporters, one suddenly understood.</p> <p>There had never been Brown-Blair tribal war, let alone one that lasted even longer than the Bevan-Gaitskell split, it was all got up by the prime minister's sidekicks, presumably not including Ed Balls. In an early aside Balls himself reinforced the appeal to unity with the unexpected opinion that Tony Blair should have been on the list. </p> <p>It was a great meeting: at last there was a safe space for sentiment. There were people there who'd met Clement Attlee; one person had shared a platform with Ramsay MacDonald, although only in his mother's arms, another had been the shop steward of the Fords' sewing machinists whose strike led to the equal pay legislation. After years when new Labour seemed in denial about its history, there was a spirit of celebration about the opportunity to argue over what really mattered to the party. </p> <p>It was of course a travesty that Barbara Castle didn't win. Listen here as Fiona Mactaggart, her champion, explains how she represented both pragmatism and inspiration:</p> <p>But tellingly, it was Kenneth Morgan's improbable picture of Keir Hardie handling the 21st century collapse of capitalism that wowed today's audience:</p> <p>Scratch any Labour activist, and there is always a powerful desire for principle. Which is why no leader can ever quite live up to them.</p>",
  "<p>Banks should have to put aside reserves in times of boom that they can draw down in times of bust to prevent banking crises like the current one pulling down whole economies in their wake, Bank of England deputy governor Sir John Gieve argued today.</p> <p>Outlining a series of practical regulatory measures that could prevent banks' behaviour getting out of hand in future and put flesh on the bones of Gordon Brown's and Alistair Darling's promises to clamp down on the excesses of the City, Gieve said the measures should be used alongside interest rate setting to provide the central bank with a better arsenal of tools to control the economy.</p> <p>\"In my view the case for macro-prudential policies alongside monetary policy is compelling,\" Gieve said in a speech. He said the international Financial Stability Forum, which is leading the international regulatory response to the crisis, was already considering the scope for such instruments to \"dampen the destabilising procyclicality in financial markets\". </p> <p>\"To do this we need to do more than simply raise the minimum levels of capital and liquidity that regulators, rating agencies, or the markets require. We need to create reserves based on macroeconomic factors, which can be drawn down as the cycle turns down and have to be replenished on the upswing when profits are high.\"</p> <p>He pointed to a system called \"dynamic provisioning\" in Spain as an example of a system which works well in that respect. Spanish banks have been notably unscathed by the credit crunch and remained conservative in their lending practices during that country's recent housing market boom, meaning they are not unduly threatened now that Spanish property prices are tumbling.</p> <p>Gieve added: \"One lesson of recent events is that the capital and liquidity buffers need to be higher for everyone. The long decline in holdings of liquid assets by banks for example has to be reversed a bit and the increase in leverage likewise.\"</p> <p>Although Darling thinks there are considerable practical problems with forcing banks to make provisions during good times to draw on in bad, Gieve is a key part of government efforts to rein in some of the City's more dubious activities and therefore carries considerable weight. The FSA, for example, is already strengthening its prudential supervision. </p> <p>Gieve called on other countries to help fill in the gaps in the current regulatory framework governing banks' activities.</p> <p>\"For example, on mortgage origination in the US, increasing the capital requirements for some credit products and loan commitments, and ensuring that investors and rating agencies assess new products more diligently.\"</p> <p><strong>Interest rates</strong></p> <p>Gieve also said he now thought that the dampening effect of the credit crunch on the economy could be bigger than previously thought - a possible hint that he could be leaning towards voting for an interest rate cut in the coming month or two.</p> <p>\"While we must remain vigilant for any signs of inflation expectations drifting upwards, the news on that front is encouraging. On the other side, the risk we must be careful not to underestimate is the deflationary consequences of the credit crisis.\"</p> <p>Some economists who are critical of the Bank's monetary policy committee think it should be cutting interest rates rapidly now to prevent the economy tipping into a deep and prolonged recession. The MPC is concerned that inflation remains high and well above the target but should focus more on the rapid slowdown in the economy which, alongside falling oil prices, will soon push inflation down sharply, they say.<br></p>",
  "<p><strong>How is the US Congress aiming to address the turmoil on Wall Street and the meltdown in the home mortgage industry?</strong></p> <p>The Bush administration, spearheaded by treasury secretary Henry Paulson, has proposed a plan that would allow the treasury department to spend up to $700bn to purchase mortgage-based assets from troubled financial institutions. </p> <p>To be eligible under the Bush plan, firms must have \"significant operations in the US\" unless the treasury secretary waives the requirement. The treasury department would hire managers to purchase and eventually sell the assets.</p> <p><strong>That sounds like a lot of money.</strong><br>The $700bn figure is roughly the amount the US has spent on the war in Iraq so far. That is about one quarter of the annual federal budget.</p> <p><strong>Is Congress cooperating?</strong><br>Congressional leaders of both parties have indicated they will enact legislation along the lines of the Bush request this week, in part because neither the Democrats nor the Republicans want to appear to be obstructing the bailout with elections looming in November.</p> <p><strong>What do Democratic members of Congress want?</strong><br>Democrats want more protections for homeowners and strengthened congressional oversight. Those would include allowing bankruptcy judges to rewrite mortgages on primary residences to make terms more favourable for borrowers. Democrats also want to limit the compensation and \"golden parachute\" packages for executives of firms participating in the bailout. </p> <p><strong>What do Republican members of Congress want?</strong><br>Meanwhile, conservative Republicans are disturbed by the size of the obligation being foisted onto taxpayers and the scope of power being given to the treasury department. In principle many would oppose strictures on executive pay, but McCain has precluded that argument by siding with Democrats. The bloc has yet to offer an alternative and will likely back the Paulson plan as presented while opposing Democratic efforts to wring concessions from Bush. </p> <p><strong>What do Barack Obama and John McCain say?</strong><br>The economic distress has had both presidential candidates adopting populist tones and calling for more regulation of the financial services industry.</p> <p>Obama backs the Bush plan in principle but said in return for the mammoth public investment, financial firms should submit to oversight and regulation.</p> <p>McCain backs a \"very tight, targeted bill\" without the provisions sought by the Democrats, his economic adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin told the Wall Street Journal.</p>",
  "<p>Global financial meltdown may have bought Gordon Brown time, but just as important among many Labour MPs and activists in Manchester this week is fear of the return of full-blown Blairism in the shape of a resurgent David Miliband.</p> <p>After a couple of months in which the foreign secretary's bid to position himself as Brown's main challenger seemed to have come unstuck, his weekend media offensive \u2013 with lavish soft focus interviews in the Times and <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2008/09/20/david-miliband-spells-out-his-vision-on-eve-of-labour-conference-115875-20745391/\">Daily Mirror</a> \u2013 sent waves of alarm through the growing ranks of those who want to see Labour respond to the economic crisis by moving away from the discredited market orthodoxies of the Blairite years. Despite Miliband's unpopularity among MPs and the unions, few doubt the likely impact of a full-on media campaign on his behalf in any post-Brown election (hence his discreet wooing of the Murdoch empire).</p> <p>Even more worrying from that point of view was the apparent endorsement of Miliband by the health secretary, Alan Johnson, seen by some on Labour's centre-left and in the unions as potentially the most credible Stop Miliband candidate \u2013 though his own Blairite history casts doubt on how viable a vessel he could be for the hopes of those looking for a change of political direction.</p> <p>In fact, Johnson's Miliband-flattering <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4791378.ece\">interview</a> with the Times stopped short of ruling himself out (\"I don't aspire to that job\") and \u2013 despite claims from leading Blairites that Johnson has signed off a deal to run as Miliband's deputy \u2013 the man himself has now let it be known that his remarks have been misunderstood, and no such decision has been taken.</p> <p>There's no doubt that the mood running through the conference in favour of a crackdown on City speculators, redistribution and tougher intervention in the economy should benefit any leadership contender prepared to move on from the well-worn New Labour formulas of the past.</p> <p>But Miliband has made it abundantly clear in his various appearances on the conference fringe that he will be doing no such thing. His speech last night to the pressure group Progress was classic Blair \u2013 New Labour was a \"coalition, not a faction\", guided by a combination of \"head and heart\" \u2013 and his apparent self-criticism offered little sense of any kind of new political direction. Earlier in the evening, he defended the Iraq war without qualifications, insisting \u2013 like Blair \u2013 that the rights and wrongs of the invasion and occupation would be left to history.</p> <p>Brown and Alistair Darling have been making a few more rhetorical concessions to the dominant mood: the prime minister calling for tighter control on \"irresponsible\" City bonuses and the chancellor today promising the conference to do \"whatever it takes\" to deal with the upheavals in the markets. But both have stopped well short of promising the kind of decisive action both the party and the public are evidently looking for \u2013 and Brown has typically rushed to reassure the City that Labour remains a \"party of business\".</p> <p>That's obviously not going to satisfy the mood inside the conference and beyond. The <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7627608.stm\">call</a> by the Dagenham MP Jon Cruddas for a new 45% tax rate on those earning \u00a3175,000 a year to fund tax cuts for low and middle income earners has attracted widespread support. Meanwhile, delegates this morning voted for a radical union-led agenda \u2013 including price controls and a windfall tax on the energy companies \u2013 to be sent to the party's national policy forum. Of course, that doesn't make it Labour policy, but it's a significant reflection of the new pressure for change.</p> <p>Outside the conference hall, there are other signs of the wider dissatisfaction with the refusal of New Labour over more than a decade to give any representation to the huge swathe of public opinion to its left. Throughout the conference, a <a href=\"http://www.conventionoftheleft.org\">convention of the left</a> \u2013 organised by John Nicholson, former Labour deputy leader of Manchester city council \u2013 is holding a series of meetings and debates on the alternative to Labour's record of \"wars, privatisation and environmental destruction\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.poptel.org.uk/scgn/\">Labour Campaign Group</a> MPs, such as John McDonnell, Jeremy Corbyn and Katy Clark, have joined speakers from a dizzying array of groups and parties, from Respect to the left Greens, with the aim of bringing together the notoriously fissiparous left inside and outside the Labour party in common action. Some see it as part of another attempt to form a new leftwing party. But what it certainly reflects is the frustration at the effective denial of a voice to millions in the political mainstream \u2013 and an early taste of some of the fractious fallout that can be expected to follow a Labour defeat at the next election.</p>",
  "<p>The outgoing head of the stricken insurance company AIG has voluntarily forfeited a $22m (\u00a312m) severance package after being effectively sacked from his job as part of a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/sep/17/marketturmoil.creditcrunch\">bail-out by the US Treasury</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337869944\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2008/09/22/willum.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Willumstad, AIG\" width=\"220\" height=\"310\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Librado Romero/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Librado Romero/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Robert Willumstad, who was only appointed chief executive in June, was told his services were no longer required when the US government rescued the company from the brink of bankruptcy last week. </p> <p>In an email to his successor Edward Liddy, he wrote: \"I prefer not to receive severance while shareholders and employees have lost considerable value in their AIG shares.\"</p> <p>Willumstad's decision averts a likely outcry over the size of the payout at a time when political momentum is gathering pace for a crackdown on perceived excesses in Wall Street remuneration.</p> <p>AIG's board decided that he was entitled to the money under his employment contract which was drafted in generous terms three months ago to lure him from a lucrative job in private equity. Willumstad told Liddy that he would \"forgo\" the money because he had been unable to execute his planned restructuring.</p> <p>Struggling with liabilities on financial insurance policies, AIG suffered a cash crisis last week and was kept afloat by an $85bn loan from the US treasury. In return, the treasury is due to take an 80% stake in AIG and Willumstad was told to step aside in a phone call made personally by the treasury secretary, Henry Paulson.</p> <p>Many AIG investors are unhappy with the terms of the bail-out. A group of rebels was due to meet in New York to discuss last-minute alternatives which would avoid their shares being heavily diluted.</p> <p>The former AIG boss Hank Greenberg was due to be represented at the meeting, according to his lawyer. Greenberg has mooted the possibility of seizing back control of the firm either through a proxy battle for boardroom seats or through a consortium of financial investors.</p>",
  "<p>The power struggle to shape the largest financial bailout in US history begins today in Congress, where members of both parties are weighing how many conditions to set on a rescue plan for Wall Street.</p> <p>Though few in Washington dispute treasury secretary Henry Paulson's insistence on quick passage of the proposed $700bn government intervention, Democrats are serving notice that they will seek to add more taxpayer benefits and oversight to the plan before approving it.</p> <p>\"We will not simply hand over a $700bn blank check to Wall Street and hope for a better outcome,\" Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, said yesterday.</p> <p>Republicans, meanwhile, are caught between an unpopular president and a newly populist presidential nominee as they decide whether to pursue their own changes to the financial-market restructuring. </p> <p>John Boehner, the leader of House Republicans, yesterday proposed an oversight panel to monitor Paulson's implementation of the plan. All profits from the government's ultimate sale of risky mortgage-backed securities should help pay off the US national debt, Boehner added. </p> <p>Yet even those issues on which the two parties can find common ground \u2013 such as congressional oversight and ensuring that taxpayers see a share of the profits from the bailout \u2013 could remain obstacles to final passage of Paulson's proposal.</p> <p>The tumult of the past week has shaken Republicans' ideological faith in free markets, leaving their once-vaunted party unity in shambles with 42 days remaining before the election. </p> <p>Some of their members may echo John McCain, who joined senior Democrats in calling for a cap on executive compensation at firms that receive government help.</p> <p>Other Republicans are more likely to back Paulson's call for a \"clean\" rescue bill that lacks any new provisions to benefit taxpayers. </p> <p>If Democratic congressional leaders attempt to pad the bailout with aid to homeowners facing bankruptcy due to foreclosure, the party of George Bush could stage a rally to support his version of the plan.</p> <p>The Senate banking committee is slated to hear from Paulson and Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke tomorrow, with its House counterpart following on Wednesday. </p> <p>Another potentially controversial element of the bailout is Paulson's request for legal immunity as he manages the purchase of distressed Wall Street assets. Given that the treasury secretary is a former Wall Street CEO, the immunity grant could raise questions about Paulson's ability to unilaterally assist his allies at Goldman Sachs and other embattled firms.</p> <p>House Democrats hope to vote on the financial bailout before the weekend, but few on Capitol Hill expect Congress to keep to its original schedule and depart for the year on Friday. </p> <p>Senator Chris Dodd, chairman of the banking panel, has asked to keep Congress in session throughout the autumn in case more quick financial action is needed.</p> <p>As Paulson's plan began circulating yesterday, Democratic senator Robert Menendez gave voice to his party's common complaint: the Bush administration proposal is \"all Wall Street and no Main Street\".</p> <p>The Senate banking panel's senior Republican Richard Shelby, sounded almost like a Democrat yesterday as he told CBS news that the bailout \"doesn't do anything for the homeowner\".</p> <p>\"This is doing something for the banks, and if [homeowners] get any relief it will be incidental,\" Shelby said.</p> <p>With the markets responding anxiously to any news from Washington, the pressure will mount on Congress to act quickly as the week progresses. But as the debate begins, only one thing appeared certain: the bailout is in for a bumpy ride.</p>",
  "<p>Ministers have promised to review tuition fees for part-time students after acknowledging there was \"inequality\" in the system because they have to pay their fees upfront.</p> <p>Bill Rammell, the higher education minister, told a debate on university funding organised by the University and College Union today that part-time student funding would be considered in the review of university funding promised for next year. </p> <p>\"It's going to have to answer questions about part-timers,\" he said. \"There is an inequity between adults in the workplace trying to better themselves and the traditional student.\" </p> <p>The review was established as a condition of the introduction of top-up fees in 2006 after a debate in parliament that reduced the government's majority to just five. </p> <p>It will consider whether to lift the \u00a33,145 cap on fees to create a more varied market in the cost of going to university amid deep controversy over the impact of higher fees on the government's attempts to widen participation to university. </p> <p>By law, the review has to happen in 2009 but all political parties are concerned about raising an issue which will prove deeply unpopular on the doorstep in the run-up to the general election. A poll last week by the UCU suggested that up to two-thirds of voters oppose higher fees. </p> <p>Full-time students have to pay fees but not until they are earning above a certain threshold while part-time students have to pay fees when they sign up for courses. </p> <p>Rammell repeatedly said it was a \"mistake\" in 1998 to scrap the student grant and highlighted the fact that nearly two-thirds of new students this year qualified for some sort of funding.<br> Wes Streeting, president of the National Union of Students, said that the government was \"shirking\" an important debate because it feared the political consequences. </p> <p>\"We expect the government to engage thoughtfully and properly in a debate about how universities are funded. They can't avoid this because they are worried by voters' opinions. They should listen to voters on this.\"</p> <p>He welcomed the decision to look again at fees. \"It's critically important that the government revisits part-time students who have been shamefully overlooked.\"<br></p>",
  "<p>Like a weird cinematic version of the Roll Chronicle of British kings, it sometimes seems that the GPO Film Unit stands at the head of the family tree of British film and television. Established in 1933, its ethos and influence can be discerned everywhere, from Coronation Street to reality soaps via Ealing Studios and The Green Cross Code Man. Melvyn Bragg even described the GPO Unit as \"the font from which our tradition of arts programmes spring\". To celebrate the release of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/19/documentary?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=film\">Love Letters and Live Wires</a>, a theatrical tour of GPO curios and classics, here is our own alphabetical introduction to an enduring, and highly unlikely, cultural legacy. </p> <p><strong>A is for Aboriginal</strong> Painted directly on to celluloid, the startling GPO shorts of New Zealander Len Lye were inspired by Aboriginal and Maori art. In the lower case sense of the word, the GPO Film Unit might be the aboriginal form of modern British cinema.</p> <p><strong>Blackheath</strong> In 1933 the unit moved to new sound-equipped studios at Bennett Park Road. As well as frequently appearing in their film's \"street\" scenes, Blackheath provided one of the pillars of the unit's future success. The second was ...</p> <p><strong>Alberto \"Cav\" Cavalcanti</strong> The Brazilian made a huge impact on the GPO's films on account of his experience in the commercial industry (ie he actually knew what he was doing) and because of his avant-garde know-how, as evidenced in <a href=\"http://www.filmreference.com/Films-Ra-Ro/Rien-Que-les-Heures.html\">Rien que les heures</a>.</p> <p><strong>Documentary</strong> If the wider world of British cinema is mentioned at all in a standard film history tome, it's invariably mentioned in conjunction with documentary, several conceptions of which were \"invented\" by the unit. </p> <p><strong>Empire Marketing Board</strong> The unit was created in embryo at the Empire Marketing Board, unusual origins that ensured it was more attuned to the work of a Commonwealth-wide network of interesting modernists than the petty politics of Whitehall.</p> <p><strong>Denis Foreman</strong> According to the future luminary of Granada TV, the unit much impressed the Italian neorealists.</p> <p><strong>John Grierson</strong> The godfather of the GPO Cosa Nostra. As a critic he coined the term \"documentary\", as head of the unit Grierson made it his business to keep the family in check.</p> <p><strong>H is for Harry</strong> When not expounding theories about the proper role of film in a democratic society, Grierson tended to appoint a) Scotsmen and b) people who had worked at sea. Harry Watt ticked both of these boxes and, in his strong-willed collectivism and spirited individualism, seemed typically GPO. His <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1330491/\">Saving of Bill Blewitt</a> was the first \"story documentary\" ever made. </p> <p><strong>The Imperial Six</strong> The GPO's first package of commercially released shorts - Weather Forecast, Granton Trawler, <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1341944/index.html\">Cable Ship</a>, <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1290738/index.html\">6.30 Collection</a>, Spring on the Farm and Windmill in Barbados.</p> <p><strong>Humphrey Jennings</strong> Writer, painter, designer and in Lindsay Anderson's endlessly quoted estimation \"the only true poet of the English cinema\". </p> <p><strong>Kazoo band</strong> Controversially featured in Spare Time, Jennings' affectionate, subtle and sly <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/443890/\">portrait of Britain at play</a>. </p> <p><strong>Love on the Wing</strong> Freewheeling jazz-influenced animation genius from...</p> <p><strong>Norman McLaren</strong> The Scottish animator was just one of the unlikely band of avant gardists that blossomed under Grierson's patronage.</p> <p><strong>Night Mail</strong> The GPO's cinematic testament par excellence. As redolent of the 1930s as a Poirot novel, the Shell guides and Frank Pick's transformation of the Underground, <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/530415/index.html\">Night Mail</a> is stuffed with bad jokes, cracking poetry and progressive patriotism. The story of a night on the travelling post office (TPO) exemplifies what historian Ross McKibbin has described as one of the key characteristics of the era, \"the redistribution of cultural esteem.\" </p> <p><strong>Organisational efficiency</strong> London Midland Scottish celebrated Night Mail's success by repainting the interiors of the TPO green \"to avoid eyestrain\" and introducing electric tea urns.</p> <p><strong>Philatelists</strong> It is often argued that the unit's distance from commercial cinema chains limited their influence, but who needs popcorn-munchers when you've got philatelists? For many years <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1300758/index.html\">William Coldstream's The King's Stamp</a>, which details Barnett Freedman's sketching of the jubilee stamp, was the most watched film ever made. </p> <p><strong>Q is for Quentin</strong> Reynolds, that is. While the US remained neutral during the second world war, American reporters such as Quentin Reynolds and Ed Murrow were invited to provide voiceovers to the unit's footage of the blitz. Their eloquent delivery was engineered to elicit the sympathy of sceptical North American audiences.</p> <p><strong>Lotte Reiniger</strong> The German puppeteer and silhouette animator was one of the many talented emigres who found refuge from the Nazi regime at the unit. </p> <p><strong>Slavery</strong> What the abolition of slavery \u00a32 coin was to 2008, the unit's God's Chillun was to the 1938 anti-slavery campaign. </p> <p><strong>Sir Stephen Tallents</strong> In addition to establishing the unit, the aptly-named Tallents sketched the contested border between Estonia and Latvia, played football for Grenoble in their historic win over Lyon, introduced listener research at the BBC, and founded public relations in Britain. In his spare time he went walking with his friend William Beveridge, wrote short-story collections, ran a rat-skin leather business and expounded the health benefits of squirrel pie.</p> <p><strong>Unesco</strong> After the war the GPO's creatives and technicians scattered far and wide, their influence spread into commercial film-making and independent television and resulted in the establishment of the <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/films/1964to1979/filmpage_strangers.htm\">\"Charley says\"</a> Central Office of Information. The formidable Grierson was even appointed controller of film at Unesco.</p> <p><strong>Valentine's Day</strong> The introduction of Rex Whistler's Valentine's Day telegram, Giles Gilbert Scott's <a href=\"http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/the-phone-box/biography/the-red-phone-box-biography-finished\">Jubilee Kiosk</a>, Telephone Chess tournaments and the phenomenally successful Speaking Clock \u2013 the film unit was just one aspect of the wider GPO renaissance of the 1930s.</p> <p><strong>W is for Wystan Hugh Auden</strong> It is more than coincidence that in his year at the GPO, Auden aired two of the century's best known poems in English \u2013 Night Mail and Funeral Blues (later popularised by Four Weddings and a Funeral.) </p> <p><strong>X</strong> In a newly-enfranchised Britain a scrawled \"X\" was no longer enough. Tallents saw the GPO's films as providing a \"sextant and compass\" that could help map out a more democratic future.</p> <p><strong>\"Young men in high-necked sweaters\"</strong> JB Priestley's impression of the unit after taking a starring role in They Live in Two Worlds, a film which presciently argued that modern communication technology would eventually bring a new transnational global community into being. </p> <p><strong>Zeal</strong> The son of a preacher, it is unsurprising that Grierson's rhetoric has a whiff of Calvinism about it. \"Studio films largely ignore the possibility of opening up the screen on the real world,\" he argued, \"documentary can achieve an intimacy of knowledge and effect impossible in the shim sham mechanics of the studio and the lily-fingered interpretations of the metropolitan actor.\" How right he still is.</p>",
  "<p>There is a big myth in politics, and it is this: that New Labour really was new. That it was a truly centre-ground party that had radically abandoned the leftist ideologies of yesteryear that had led the country into the mire of the late 70s. Fitting then that the party's theme song <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dl-ai9HuR60\">Things Can Only Get Better</a> should have been by a group called D:Ream. Because now we've woken up from the dream of Blair to find ourselves in a country that at heart is testament to deeply leftist politics. </p> <p>The tax burden is actually higher now than in 1978 (at 36% of GDP, compared with 33% three decades ago). We now boast a civil service of half a million - about the size of Sheffield. That includes a cut in the size of our armed forces from 238,550 in 1978 to 73,290 today. Yet it does not include all the jobs that have been pushed off the public-sector books by being recategorised under a plethora of agencies and trusts. And we are facing huge national debt - a financial position that is closer to the 1970s than we'd like to think.</p> <p>True, there were some genuinely centre-ground ideologues: Stephen Byers and the Blairites (surely a better name for a rock band than D:Ream?), Charles Clarke and Alan Milburn. But many of those genuinely good centre-ground ideas (such as academies, for example, resurrecting the idea of Conservatives' city technology colleges) were being implemented off the back of old-left mechanisms. They are more bureaucratic and expensive than they need be. Funded by ever-increasing taxes, administered by a burgeoning civil service. </p> <p>So Blair was able to send centre-ground fireworks up into the sky to woo middle England. Meanwhile, back in the murk on terra firma, the old control-based machine of the left chugged on behind the scenes, with Gordon Brown at the wheel.</p> <p>And if the old saying \"By their fruits you shall know them\" is true, our taxation levels, civil service size, level of national debt and inability to deal with the global economic downturn shows that after all the fireworks and good centre ground ideas, there was not so much that was \"new\" about Labour. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7622324.stm\">Milburn now wants change</a>, for the simple reason that a change in Labour never really took place in the first place. </p> <p>It's a real shame. An opportunity missed. New Labour could have delivered the dream and truly changed Britain for the good - if only its control-freak instinct could have been resisted. Even now, Labour politicians talk of \"empowering people\". But the very fact that it is Whitehall granting people these so called \"powers\" over their own lives, which were theirs to begin with, reinforces Whitehall's dominance. </p> <p>Giving a school \"power to innovate\" is simply giving it permission to apply to central government to avoid a barrage of unnecessary Whitehall restrictions, for a limited period. That's not empowerment - it's centralisation in disguise. </p> <p>As the credit crunch begins to bite in the high street and bastions of the financial world fall like dominos, the grim reality now dawns that, once again, the country's been spent out by a leftist government. Once again, it will take hard-headed, sensible, centre-right politics to sort it out. </p> <p>Will Gordon Brown retreat further back to his deep-left core at his party conference speech tomorrow, and reach for the \"capitalism is bad\" vote? If he does, he will be disowning any success he may have presided over in the City. But even if he does not, the nation just does not have the time or money for any more pseudo centre-right. The D:Ream is over. Things are getting tough, and it's time for the real thing.</p> <p>Talking of academies, I attended the opening ceremony of the new Brightstowe Academy, in Shirehampton, Bristol, this week. The previous school (Portway) had struggled for years, but the <a href=\"www.oasistrust.org\">Oasis Trust</a> came in and gave it a new birth. </p> <p>I was struck not only by the energy and vision of Oasis, and the head, Julie Winterman, but also by their sensitivity to what young people need and want. Perhaps the most striking part of the day was seeing how many of the things that really made a difference didn't cost anything. One girl told me how, when Oasis took over, they were all put into houses, in their school, and had inter-house competitions. </p> <p>I saw the benefits in action: the opening event was finishing and hundreds of young people were getting ready to storm out of the marquee. Chaos looked certain to ensue. </p> <p>The head took the microphone. \"I know which house is the winner of the behaviour competition,\" she said. (Or something similar.) \"But if you don't all behave and leave in an orderly fashion, that might change.\" Hush fell. And several hundred teenagers filed out in order. </p> <p>Good buildings and excellent facilities are important - but won't make a school. A good head, organisation and vision cost nothing, but are priceless. Here's to future success at Brightstowe.</p>",
  "<p>Nomura today secured a deal to acquire the Asian operations of Lehman Brothers, a week after the US investment bank's collapse sparked panic in global financial markets.<br> Japan's biggest brokerage house saw off rival bids from Barclays and Standard Chartered following talks over the weekend. It is now thought that Nomura is also the front-runner in talks for Lehman's London businesses. Barclays is known to be interested in the equities part of the London operations, while Nomura was prepared to bid for a wide-range of businesses. </p> <p>The Asia deal, thought to be worth around $230m (\u00a3125m), includes all of Lehman's franchises in the region and around 3,000 employees, all of whom will be offered new contracts. </p> <p>\"This is a transformational deal that allows us to bring together the strengths of Nomura and Lehman Brothers to further deliver value to our clients,\" said Kenichi Watanabe, Nomura's president and CEO. \"It will significantly extend our reach in Asia. We see immediate strategic benefits, delivering the scale and scope to realize our vision to be a world-class investment bank.\" </p> <p>Jesse Bhattal, CEO of Lehman Brothers Asia, said the deal represented \"a remarkable opportunity\" for both firms. \"We are honored to work with Nomura in building a platform which we believe offers tremendous potential.\" </p> <p>In London, Lehman employees were waiting to hear news of a potential bid which could save up to 3,000 jobs. Dan Schwarzmann, joint administrator and partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: \"We have now focused on one party as they are interested in acquiring a wider team, which should result in a better deal for staff and creditors of these businesses. Given the complexity of Lehman brothers, these negotiations are difficult, but I'm hoping to give certainty to all involved as soon as possible.\" </p> <p>In the Asia Pacific region, Lehman's net revenue for the first half of the year stood at $1.4bn, or about 20% of the bank's overall revenues. </p> <p>Data from the financial services agency shows that Lehman's Japanese unit manages about \u00a51.2tn (\u00a36.1bn) worth of assets from investors. It was last week ordered to suspend most of its operations until September 26 after the US bank collapsed under the weight of $60bn in real-estate debt. </p> <p>Lehman Brothers Japan, which opened in 1973, applied for court protection with debts totaling \u00a53.43tn, making it the second-biggest bankruptcy in Japan since the second world war. </p> <p>Nomura and Barclays have been locked in competition to take control of Lehman's operations in Asia and Europe. Nomura executives are thought to have clinched the deal following talks in Hong Kong over the weekend. </p> <p>Last week, the British bank agreed to pay $1.75bn for Lehman's north American investment banking and capital markets businesses, but was outbid in Asia. Shares in Nomura rose 8% in Tokyo today on news of the possible buyout.</p>",

Darling will also raise his forecasts for public borrowing and outline medium-term plans for bringing the public finances back under control.</p> <p>In his keynote speech to the Labour party conference, Darling said that he was allowing borrowing to rise during the downturn in order to \"support the economy and families when they need it most\".</p> <p>But with some analysts predicting that the budget deficit could hit \u00a390bn as Britain suffers its first recession since the early 1990s, the chancellor warned that there were tough decisions on tax and spending ahead.</p> <p>\"Make no mistake, discipline in public finances is essential; being clear about our priorities.</p> <p>\"In the medium term, governments everywhere have to live within their means \u2013 so I will set out this autumn how I will continue to deliver sound public finances.\"</p> <p>Darling is also expected to use his PBR address to acknowledge that the financial turmoil has made it necessary for the government to breach its fiscal rules \u2013 to borrow only for investment over the economic cycle and to keep public debt below 40% of GDP. </p> <p>Darling will use his Mais lecture in the City next month to explain how fiscal policy should respond to financial crises.</p> <p>Referring to his comment in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/aug/30/alistairdarling.economy\">a recent Guardian interview</a> that the global economy was facing its most challenging time in 60 years, Darling said: \"I've made headlines by saying just how tough times are. I draw little comfort from the fact that many people now understand what I meant.</p> <p>\"Yes we are facing real problems. Our economy, along with every other developed country, is bound to slow. It's my job to be realistic. And these problems will take time to work their way through. But I also said \u2013 and this made a lot fewer headlines \u2013 that I was confident that Britain will come through these difficult times.\"</p> <p>The chancellor said the global financial system would \"never be the same\" after the turmoil caused by the year-long crisis. \"These are extraordinary, turbulent times. A crisis which has rocked the financial institutions around the world on top of huge rises in oil, food and commodity prices.\"</p> <p>Darling said the government had been right to respond to the crisis by taking Northern Rock into public ownership and by introducing legislation to make it easier to intervene if other banks ran into problems. The Bank of England had been authorised to inject more than \u00a3100bn to help stabilise the UK banking system.</p> <p>These measures were essential, the chancellor added, but would take time to work. \"We are on a difficult road and there will, I am afraid, be bumps along the way. But I will continue to do whatever it takes to maintain financial stability and I remain confident we will do so.\"</p> <p>The chancellor plans to introduce a new banking bill to the Commons within a fortnight, designed to strengthen supervision and give new powers to financial regulators. The new chairman of the Financial Services Authority, Lord Turner, to \"review urgently what we need to do to improve the system.</p> <p>\"It is not a question to light-touch regulation against heavy-handed regulation. It's about effective regulation. I can promise that wherever weaknesses are found in the financial system, whether in the powers of the government, the Bank of England or the FSA, I will take steps to deal with it.\"</p> <p>Darling added: \"We need to look as well at the culture of huge bonuses which have distorted the way decisions are made. Bonuses should encourage good long-term decisions, not short-term reckless ones.\" </p> <p>The chancellor believes the FSA should use its existing powers to clamp down on companies where high bonuses have created incentives for traders to take excessive risks.</p>",
  "<p>Has the famously savvy first minister of Scotland finally slipped up? The sudden and dramatic sale of HBOS last week has put Alex Salmond's political and economic reputation under unwelcome scrutiny. </p> <p>First, his much-quoted claim that \"spivs and speculators\" were solely to blame for the bank's collapse in value has been dismissed comprehensively by bankers, including his own allies, and business leaders.</p> <p>His claim that an independent Scottish government would have found \u00a3100bn to bail HBOS out has been ridiculed, not least because HBOS's bosses were willing partners in the Lloyds TSB rescue.</p> <p>Labour has also gleefully seized on the revelation that Salmond's chief economic advisor and mentor Sir George Mathewson, former head of Salmond's old employer RBS, is one of those \"spivs\", since he now runs Toscafund Asset Management. </p> <p>That outfit was not involved in the HBOS affair - doubtless there are other Scottish financiers and institutions that were - but Mathewson told the Sunday Herald that short selling was \"perfectly valid\". </p> <p>The sale of Scotland's oldest bank - an institution integral to the country's identity - is the most significant political and financial crisis to erupt since the SNP won power last year. </p> <p>But what is most telling is that it took Salmond and his often brilliant political team much of last week to offer concrete proposals \u2013 it was in a Friday briefing to Sunday newspaper journalists that this \u00a3100bn bail-out plan came to light.</p> <p>When Salmond was pressed on what he would have done by Iain Gray, the new Labour leader, at first ministers' questions on Thursday - at the storm's height - the SNP leader had no answer. </p> <p>Gray let that slide - either too nervous at his maiden outing at FMQs (Salmond is formidable on his feet) or believing it would be uncool to upset the collegiate air of grief and loss that gripped the chamber.</p> <p>This, it seems, is a time when Scotland on its own would have been largely impotent. Salmond has spoken of laws to control short-selling spivs and speculators, but since Scotland has no international stock exchange, that would be Westminster's job. </p> <p>It is a fundamental question for the SNP: the country's booming financial sector (with its \u00a3600bn of assets under management) is at the core of Scotland's economy. </p> <p>While Scotland's growth has lagged behind the UK average, its employment rates are healthier; so too are house prices. Given the dragging effect of the immense deprivation in parts of west Scotland, this is impressive.</p> <p>But HBOS and RBS are global businesses, operating at a level that dwarfs Scotland and the Scottish executive. And so too do HBOS's debts - it has been reported that it would have needed to refinance \u00a3198bn within a few months to stay solvent. </p> <p>The SNP's mooted North Sea oil fund would've evaporated overnight to quench that.</p> <p>Remember too that SNP policy is for an independent Scotland to stay with sterling, thus giving the foreign Bank of England influence over the economy, thus increasing its economic vulnerability. </p> <p>There have been other moments since the SNP's arrival in government when Scotland's interdependency and diminutive stature have been highlighted.</p> <p>In the days after the Glasgow airport attack last year, Salmond and his justice secretary, Kenny McAskill, were forced to cede control to the Metropolitan police. The surviving suspect was handed over to the English (although it is arguable that an independent Scotland would not have been attacked in the first place).</p> <p>Another telling moment was Gordon Brown's only appearance in the chamber at Holyrood, standing alongside Microsoft's billionaire founder, Bill Gates, in February 2007 to give a speech on education, technology and globalisation. </p> <p>This was Brown in his element - the global player, polishing his legacy. <br>Nicola Sturgeon, Salmond's gifted deputy and a future SNP leader, watched from the front row, an onlooker. Surely even the most optimistic nationalist would doubt Gates would share a stage with Salmond or Sturgeon.</p> <p>What this affair has done is to give Salmond's opponents, particularly the Scottish Labour party, the first evidence that the first minister is fallible after all. </p> <p>But his critics may overestimate this affair's damage to Salmond's reputation, not least since Salmond is in this for the long game. His short-term goal is re-election in 2011. He wants consolidation of the SNP's grip on power. Independence can wait. </p> <p>His \"spivs and speculators\" rhetoric is likely to play well among the voters of Glenrothes in central Fife, many of whom are commuters working for Scotland's great banks. </p> <p>In Glenrothes, Methil and Buckhaven, many voters will likely be cheering on a feisty Scottish leader again fighting for Scotland's interests, particularly if he snatches the credit for saving HBOS jobs in Scotland after his frenetic series of meetings with Lloyds TSB, his financial services advisory committee, and the unions this week. </p> <p>It seems Brown is poised to begin personally campaigning in Glenrothes so he will have the chance to contest that. </p> <p>But the increasingly heavy assaults on Brown from inside the Labour party, evidence that his putative byelection coordinator Frank Roy has been sacked, and the rash of weekend opinion polls suggesting anything from a narrow SNP lead to total Labour wipe-out in Glenrothes, will influence this byelection far more than a debate about stock market regulation. </p> <p>Alex Salmond will survive this, and on current form is the only leader of the two who will see the 2011 Holyrood election - or perhaps even the next for Westminster.</p>",

Here's <a href=\"http://vlex.com/vid/19191068\">the relevant language</a> from the United States Code:</p> <blockquote> <p>Whoever, being a candidate, directly or indirectly promises or pledges the appointment, or the use of his influence or support for the appointment of any person to any public or private position or employment, for the purpose of procuring support in his candidacy shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both; and if the violation was willful, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.</p> </blockquote> <p>Now, obviously the hard-to-prove part here is \"for the purpose of procuring support for his candidacy.\" And of course I understand that no authority figure is going to bust John McCain on this point. But this kind of thing deserves our attention. This law became law because candidates used to routinely offer important posts to people who could deliver votes as part of political deals, either for their support or for the support of constituencies with whom they were popular. </p> <p>Whether McCain crossed a legal line or not, that is essentially what he's doing here. I happen to know Andrew Cuomo and I think he was a mostly successful cabinet official under Clinton. But let's just say that I bet McCain would've been somewhat less likely to mention Cuomo's name if he weren't Catholic.<br></p>",
  "<p>Hot irons held to human flesh. Electric shocks to a man's genitalia. Fire ants poured onto a naked prisoner in a pit.</p> <p>Those are some of the brutal acts jurors will hear about when the groundbreaking trial of former Liberian president Charles Taylor's son gets begins this week in a US federal courtroom in Miami.</p> <p>Charles McArthur Emmanuel, 31, also known as Chuckie Taylor, is charged with inflicting and ordering the torture of prisoners as head of his west African nation's feared Demon Forces.</p> <p>The case marks the first prosecution under a 1994 law criminalising torture outside US borders. It tests the principle that alleged human rights abusers should answer for their crimes no matter where they are brought to account.</p> <p>Jury selection is expected to start this week.</p> <p>Emmanuel, who has pleaded not guilty, faces a possible life sentence if convicted. Defence attorneys plan to argue that the government's witnesses are lying to obtain legal immigration status in the US and Europe.</p> <p>Emmanuel, a US citizen, was born in Boston and spent his teen years with his mother and stepfather in Orlando. He later joined his father in Africa and became head of Liberia's elite security force, known formally as the Anti-Terrorism Unit and nicknamed the Demon Forces.</p> <p>His father is currently on trial before a United Nations-backed tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, for alleged human rights violations during Sierra Leone's civil war. US agents arrested Emmanuel in March 2006, as he tried to sneak back into the country at Miami International airport.</p> <p>According to a federal indictment, Emmanuel's job from 1999 to 2002 was to intimidate, weaken and eliminate his father's political opponents.</p> <p>Prosecutors will tell jurors that Emmanuel ran a prison camp in Gbatala, Liberia, where the Demon Forces kept prisoners in pits covered with iron bars and barbed wire. Guards jabbed at the prisoners through the bars with sharp metal rods and on at least one occasion shovelled stinging ants into a pit, prosecutors allege.</p> <p>In April 1999, Emmanuel summarily executed three men and ordered guards to cut another prisoner's throat, the indictment states.</p> <p>Human rights groups praise the prosecution as an important step toward holding an alleged torturer accountable.</p> <p>However, the case has also stirred debate over controversial interrogation practices approved by US officials in the war on terror, said Theresa Harris, a lawyer with the World Organisation for Human Rights USA, based in Washington.</p> <p>\"It's important that the United States is bringing forward this prosecution, but it also raises an obvious question,\" Harris said. \"Are we only going to consider it a criminal act if another country's officials conduct torture, or are we going to hold our own officials accountable?\"</p> <p>Prosecutors and defence lawyers are already sparring over how to define torture for the jury.</p> <p>Prosecutors argue an act could be considered torture if it causes pain that is \"extreme in intensity and difficult to endure\". </p> <p>Meanwhile, Emmanuel's attorneys say the law requires a higher level of pain - that ordinarily is associated with death, organ failure or serious impairment of body functions.</p>",
  "<p>So far, three themes have emerged at the Labour conference in Manchester. First, as Martin Kettle <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/21/labourconference.economy\">points out</a> elsewhere on Cif \u2013 though I disagree a little with his take on things \u2013 Gordon Brown's belated and rather stunted critique of big finance and its iniquities have indeed released a torrent of stuff about the need to limit markets and the fact that equality is as much about the top as the bottom, and the PM's attempts to squash the genie back into the bottle are lending the story a gorgeous bathos. Second, David Miliband is pretty nakedly furthering his claim to be the coming man, reportedly making a point of speaking to people he hasn't conversed with for years, giving barnstorming speeches, and according to some whispers, moving to put Alan Johnson on a new leadership ticket. Thirdly, even if the PM's agenda has turned out to be essentially little different from his predecessors, all that pre-plot talk about the end of the battle between Brownites and Blairites is looking like so much flannel. Two things are highlighting an enduring left(ish)-right divide: whether or not New Labour's big figures pay tribute to their boss and call for unity; and \u2013 somewhat unbelievably \u2013 whether they decide to talk about those cataclysmic events in the markets.</p> <p>Last night, I took my seat at the rally organised by the Blairite pressure group <a href=\"http://www.progressonline.org.uk/\">Progress</a>, who had corralled a handsome array of speakers: David Miliband, Hazel Blears, the housing minister Caroline Flint, James Purnell, culture secretary Andy Burnham, and the ex-culture secretary Tessa Jowell, along with three definite non-Blairites: the Treasury chief secretary Yvette Cooper, higher education minister John Denham, and the Cabinet Office's Ed Miliband. Somewhat predictably, only the latter two \u2013 and, less pointedly, Caroline Flint \u2013 said anything about any need for unity and/or the merits of the PM: everybody else omitted to mention either Brown or those who want to topple him. But who knows? It was unbearably hot in Manchester Town Hall's Banqueting Room, so maybe they just forgot.</p> <p>Not that I want to read endless skullduggery into a lot of what people talked about, but there was plenty of the inevitable political code. Blears (who gave a very enlightening <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/hazel-blears-telling-it-like-it-is-937011.html\">interview</a> to the Independent) hinted at a deficit of empathy with the ordinary Joe, and said the fate of the party was less about the past than \"owning the future\". Tessa Jowell said \"people are not listening to us\", which is a pretty straight lift from the leadership plotter and ex-forestry envoy <a href=\"http://www.barrygardiner.com\">Barry Gardiner</a>. The elder Miliband said that \"doing 30% of a lot of things\" was not nearly as sensible as \"doing 80% of a small number of things\", which given Brown's habit of frantically chucking out policy after initiative after official review might also be interpreted as a dig at you-know-who.</p> <p>A precis of what else the current foreign secretary had to say: New Labour was never a faction, but \"a new coalition at the heart of the party\", but if it's going to survive, it has to be newly \"severe\" in self criticism. It had been OK at some bits of devolution, but less keen on \"building up the institutions of local civic control\" \u2013 and though the government had been \"good at military action\", something has rather got in the way of being quite so skilled at \"building the peace\" (a point that probably deserves a Cif thread of its own). There was some other rather clunky stuff about the marriage of head and heart, a bit about the underrated merits of the New Labour philosophy shorthanded as \"what works\", and a closing claim that having \"worked so hard\", it would be a shame for him and his colleagues to \"let it go\". He was, needless to say, full of vim and vigour, and the audience loved him.</p> <p>While we're here, a word about Caroline Flint, the woman who recently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/feb/05/uk.topstories3\">seemed to claim</a> that people judged to be workshy should be denied social housing. She told the meeting that the more full-blooded responses to the crisis of international finance held the danger of \"anti-profit\" and \"high tax\" politics, and that \"one-off cash payments were no solution to anything\" (another dig at GB, perhaps). Her best moment, however, was a lengthy dig at a big old straw man: those people who would supposedly return to a \"core vote strategy\", and thereby ignore \u2013 and these, I swear, are pretty much direct quotes \u2013 the majority who \"work hard\", \"pay their taxes\" and \"ask very little of government\".</p> <p>In fairness, however, she at least said something about recent world-shaking events, which despite mentions from Denham, Cooper and the younger Miliband (Ed), were bizarrely not touched on by Blears, Burnham, Purnell, Jowell, or Labour's supposed next leader, most of whom preferred to pay tribute to the wonders of deepening New Labour's public service reform programme and \"personalising\" everything.</p> <p>The inevitable conclusion? It's rather odd, isn't it, that if the boy David seals the deal, this tendency-cum-gang will have scored another triumph, just as their essential approach is revealed to be so out of step with the times? It's another example, perhaps, of those quixotic historical forces that seem to be ensuring that just as the Bush government nationalises financial institutions and even ardent free-marketeers talk about a new phase of history, the next chancellor will be that well-known interventionist George Osborne.</p>",
  "<h2>What is the inquest about?</h2> <p>The coroner, Sir Michael Wright, told the jury the inquest was a fact-finding investigation into how Jean Charles de Menezes came to be killed by the Metropolitan police. The inquest is not a trial and is not supposed to apportion blame.</p> <h2>What are the possible verdicts?</h2> <p>The family wants the jury to return a verdict of unlawful killing. That verdict would lead to pressure on the Crown Prosecution Service to reconsider its decision that no individuals should be prosecuted over the shooting. Allies of Sir Ian Blair feel such a verdict could lead to his ousting as commissioner of the Metropolitan police. Other possible verdicts include lawful killing and an open verdict.</p> <h2>How many witnesses will testify?</h2> <p>The inquest will last up to 12 weeks and is scheduled to hear from 75 witnesses. Forty-nine police who were involved in the operation have been granted anonymity, because revealing their identity would restrict their ability to carry out undercover work, or, they fear, lead to reprisals from criminals or terrorists.</p> <h2>What new facts will this inquest uncover?</h2> <p>For the first time, the public will hear from the two firearms officers who shot the innocent Brazilian dead, fearing he was a terrorist. The accounts of firearms teams and surveillance officers differ.</p> <p>The inquest will hear from witnesses on the carriage, none of whom say they heard warnings that the police claim to have shouted. The Met may explain why the firearms team were in the wrong place for several hours after being ordered to an address suspected of being used by terrorists.</p>",
  "<p>Tonight sees the start of a brand new series from the creator of Sex and the City. Candace Bushnell's <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/Lipstick_Jungle/\">Lipstick Jungle</a>, starring Brooke Shields, focuses on three successful New York women striving for personal happiness while managing their high-flying careers. Every Sex and the City fan with access to the Living channel will no doubt be positioned in front of their flat screens at 10pm, Dirty Martini in hand, awaiting the replacement for their much-missed friend.</p> <p>But they might as well up-end the cocktail over their heads and rub the slice of lime in their eyes because <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2008/feb/07/entertainment/et-lipstick7\">this disappointment</a> is really going to sting.</p> <p>Never has such a no-brainer been such a non-starter. Lipstick Jungle is a wholly cynical bid to repeat the success of its predecessor, but totally lacks the wit, warmth or integrity of the original. It's what Jeremy Clarkson thinks Sex and the City looked like to its devoted female audience. Fashions shows \u2013 check. Gruff, stubbly men \u2013 check. Female camaraderie \u2013 check. It's high-gloss packaging around stale, thin air.</p> <p>Is it possible to create a hit around packaging alone? In the US it was brought in to fill the gap left by ER and was in indirect competition with Cashmere Mafia, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2008/jan/16/cashmeremafiathenewsexand\">ABC's identikit show</a> and Darren Star's first new project since directing Sex and the City. While Lipstick Jungle is coming back for a second season, Cashmere Mafia is destined for the charity shop.</p> <p>Living TV's marketing department must look like a battlefield strewn with spent creatives, having machine-gunned the public with every promotional trick in the book to make us love Lipstick Jungle. The website tells you where to buy the characters' clothes and advises on the accoutrements you'll need for a \"viewing party\". They have fired a rolling stone out of a cannon in the hope it will actually gather moss. Every broadcaster wants a Sex and the City or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/jul/21/thewireisunmissabletelevis\">The Wire</a> to emerge fully-formed without acknowledging that shows like that take time to build up such a following.</p> <p>Lipstick Jungle may have hoodwinked the American public \u2013 well at least the six or seven million a week who tuned in to the first series \u2013 but will the UK accept this cynical clone so easily?</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Portland, Oregon. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Ben, Jerm, Anthony, Brian. <br> <strong>The background:</strong> Here's another band being chased hither and yon by thin young boys and girls wielding fat wads of cash in a bid to get them to sign to their label. It's not surprising. Talk about ticking various demographic boxes and appealing to distinctive niche markets. This Portland four-piece, who describe themselves as \"new wave/soul\" on their MySpace and have been bigged-up of late by Dave (Gang of Four) Allen on his Pampelmoose website, are wordy yet funky, the gritty vocals and chunky beats equally clear and upfront in the mix. Hockey could easily be enjoyed by Dylan, Springsteen and Hold Steady fans as much as they could by devotees of LCD Soundsystem and their ilk. In fact, if James Murphy ever decides to produce the Strokes then this is roughly how it might turn out. It's been treated by the same sort of FX used to make Julian Casablancas sound as though he's singing through a megaphone in a wind tunnel. Witty, literate songs you can dance to \u2013 they don't quite give Dylanesque narratives a dubstep undercarriage, but they do effect a collision of opposites that is quite unprecedented. <br> It could have been so different: Hockey were an LA duo who gigged a lot, signed a development deal with Columbia, and recorded with Talking Heads keyboardist Jerry Harrison before changing location and doubling in size. Now that the scruffy bike-riding vegans have an album called Mind Chaos ready for release and are already eliciting rave reviews in the States, the excitement is about to reach here. The album will make you wonder why nobody has made these connections before. Too Fake presents Hockey's funky verbosity in all its glory, all hi-hat and harangues, forming an arresting statement of intent that sees the frontman declare in no uncertain terms, \"I've got too much soul for you and it's breaking my heart in two!\", 3am Spanish is a tumble of narcotic imagery and nagging hooks, like Mink De Ville had they spent longer at Studio 54 than CBGBs. Curse This City isn't miles removed from Primal Scream when they do funky while Work, possibly the best track, recalls the Stones when they went disco circa Miss You, and Preacher, like much of Mind Chaos, is maddeningly infectious. Song Away, one of many potential singles on the album, is almost too memorable \u2013 you can imagine radio going mad for this song about songs, with its references to \"Roxy Music\" and \"80s grooves\", and driving you mad next summer.  <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Totally original! Real dance songs, with literary conceits, too.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> We were right about Black Kids, Fleet Foxes and MGMT, we're waiting to see whether we got Boy Crisis right, meanwhile here's the next mast we're nailing our colours to. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Elicit hockey-related puns \u2013 \"They Should Be So Pucky\", that type of thing. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Puck off and die. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> You can't buy anything yet because Hockey are currently deal-less, but look and listen out for the superb debut album, Mind Chaos. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Hold Steady, LCD Soundsystem, the Strokes, Boy Crisis. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/hockey\">www.myspace.com/hockey</a> </p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Marina and the Diamonds.</p>",
  "<p>The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, has sent a message to all his staff warning them to \"brace ourselves for criticism\" as the inquest into the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes gets underway.</p> <p>In a four-minute video message posted on Scotland Yard's internal website, Blair said the inquest was the most \"testing tribunal\" since the inquiry into the death of Stephen Lawrence. Should the findings be considered too damaging, Sir Ian could be forced to quit before his five-year term ends in January 2010.</p> <p>He also indirectly refers to the <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/19/police.race\">race row within his ranks</a> that has seen two senior Asian officers suspended from duty, Met sources confirmed. Although he does not mention the cases directly, Blair spoke of \"serious challenges\" from both within and outside the force.</p> <p>In the message, he says: \"Something in the region of 65 serving or former officers have been called to give evidence. There will be intense media coverage. As far as the organisation as a whole is concerned, I have asked counsel to represent the Met's position as being this: Jean Charles de Menezes was an entirely innocent man and the Metropolitan police takes full responsibility for his death.</p> <p>\"Although it happened in the middle of perhaps the most testing operational challenge the service has faced since the second world war, this death has robbed a family of their son. We have to account for that and an inquest is the place to do so.\"</p> <p>The message continues: \"Our approach will be one of humility. On 22nd July 2005, we confidently believed that our systems of command, of surveillance and of firearms intervention were among the best in the world. However, they failed in response to a previously unforeseen circumstance, suicide bombers on the run.</p> <p>\"No one set out that day with any intent to let a young man die. The officers involved will be giving evidence of doing what they did with good intention. They have my support and should have yours. Nevertheless, this will be a difficult couple of months and we must brace ourselves for criticism.\"</p>",
  "<p>Japan's ruling party today elected the colourful rightwinger Taro Aso as its leader in a last-ditch attempt to boost its flagging popularity ahead of a general election that may be only weeks away.</p> <p>Aso, 68, comfortably fought off four challengers for the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) presidency and is practically assured of being appointed prime minister by the LDP-dominated lower house on Wednesday.</p> <p>\"Standing here, I feel that this is Taro Aso's destiny,\" Aso, the grandson of the former prime minister Shigeru Yoshida, said in a brief acceptance speech.</p> <p>\"Who else but our party has the policies that address the public's concerns? I am committed to winning the election and taking a further step towards economic recovery and reform.\"</p> <p>His widely expected victory comes as Japan teeters on the brink of recession and his party confronts one of its biggest electoral challenges in more than 50 years.</p> <p>The LDP, which has governed Japan for all but 10 months since its formation in 1955, is floundering in the polls amid mounting public anger over health care reforms, millions of missing pensions premiums and the possibility of another economic downturn.</p> <p>Aso has promised a return to fiscal pump priming in an attempt to steer Japan away from recession, breaking with the free-market reforms begun seven years ago by Junichiro Koizumi.</p> <p>Aso, who advocates lower taxes for businesses, hinted that Japan may have to abandon its goal of balancing its budget by 2012.</p> <p>He must also confront deep divisions in parliament that have enabled the main opposition party, the Democratic party of Japan (DPJ), to block key legislation in the upper house, including the extension of a vessel refuelling mission in support of US-led forces in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Aso dismissed media reports that he would call an election for the end of next month before he has pushed an emergency economic stimulus package through parliament.</p> <p>Though an election isn't due until next September, Aso is expected to go to the country soon in the hope of capitalising on an expected boost in his personal approval ratings following today's victory.</p> <p>Senior opposition figures challenged Aso to call an immediate dissolution of parliament.</p> <p>\"If he wants to be prime minister, he should wait until voters decide who should lead the country in the general elections,\" said the DPJ's Naoto Kan.</p> <p>Analysts speculated that even Aso, with his inimitable brand of conservative populism, would be unable to save his party from defeat.</p> <p>\"He has to face an election right away, and it will be hard for him to survive it,\" said Koichi Nakano, a professor at Sophia University in Tokyo. \"I think there is a strong possibility that he won't.\"</p> <p>As a foreign policy hawk with a habit of making diplomatic gaffes, Aso can expect a cautious welcome from Japan's neighbours, although he has already attempted to smooth off his rougher edges.</p> <p>In a departure from his usual hardline stance, he said Japan should not view China \"with hostility\". And, despite his impeccable nationalist credentials, he is not expected to risk angering Chinese leaders by visiting Yasukuni, a controversial shrine to Japan's war dead.</p> <p>Aso never looked like losing his bid to become LDP leader at his fourth attempt. He secured 351 of the 527 votes cast by party MPs and local chapters at the end of a 12-day campaign that began after his predecessor, Yasuo Fukuda, announced his surprise resignation three weeks ago.</p> <p>The economics minister, Kaoru Yosano, finished second with 66 votes, while Yuriko Koike, the first woman to run for the LDP presidency, finished a distant third with 46.</p>",
  "<p>As the UK is failing to expand its green industries, we are also losing out on new sustainable jobs in this time of economic instability.</p> <p>In the current economic climate it's important we don't overlook opportunities for sustainable job creation. </p> <p>Some startling figures demonstrate this point. The UK is the windiest country in the European Union with around <a href=\"http://www.bwea.com/media/news/070813.html\">40% of the EU's total wind capacity</a>, yet we produce little more than 4% of the EU's wind energy. </p> <p>This massive under-utilisation of our green resources is also reflected in job figures. According to government-sponsored research, the UK has, at very best, 26,000 jobs in renewable energy. By contrast, Germany has 250,000 jobs. </p> <p>With the right investment, the UK has the wind resources to be a European green industry leader. As well as reducing carbon emissions and increasing energy security, wind power also creates a large number of jobs per TWh unit. </p> <p>While nuclear produces 75 jobs per TWh per year, oil and gas around 250 jobs, <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/gen/uploads/sewyo355prhbgunpscr51d2w29062005080838.pdf\">wind produces up to 2,400 jobs</a>.</p> <p>The government's own research shows that investing in wind could generate 43,000 new green jobs. This depends on developing turbine manufacturing in the UK. Without a major focus on developing that industry, these projections shrink to less than 7,000 jobs. </p> <p>The government's recently-launched <a href=\"http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file47660.pdf\">New Challenges, New Opportunities report (pdf)</a><br>reviews the manufacturing industry and provided an opportunity to prioritise investment in new green jobs and skills in green manufacturing. But the report sorely disappoints by prioritising investment in nuclear before renewables; leaving another environmental debt for future generations.</p> <p>The EU is pushing the UK to do more on true renewable energy, partly as a result of legislation influenced by Green MEPs from across Europe. The government describes the UK's target of producing 15% of our total energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020 as \"very challenging\". But to put that in context, Romania's target is 24% and Sweden's is 49%. In fact, most EU member states have higher 2020 renewable energy targets than the UK. </p> <p>Simply put, progress on the green agenda is being delayed by Government timidity and lack of forward thinking.</p> <p>Would the Tories be any better? David Cameron and Boris Johnson both expend their own form of renewable energy on two wheels, so perhaps. But Boris Johnson has so far put a cuts agenda ahead of the environment at City Hall. He has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/08/boris.london\">cancelled</a> a fleet of hydrogen cell buses and is putting up <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/04/london.transport\">bus and tube fares</a>. Future commitments to a range of London green initiatives, secured by Green party assembly members, are now in question: his example is hardly leading the way.</p> <p>As I argue in Green Work: Employment and skills \u2013 the climate change challenge, <a href=\"http://www.jeanlambertmep.org.uk/DocumentStore/GreenWork_report.pdf\">new report (pdf)</a>, the European Union could do much more. It needs to combine its Lisbon Agenda jobs priorities with its climate change strategy and work on training and skills. In this way EU funds could more readily aid investment in jobs and skills and help tackle climate change at the same time.</p> <p>On October 1, as a result of the <a href=\"http://www.diag.org.uk/\">Energy Performance of Buildings Directive</a> every domestic property offered for rent or sale in the UK will require an energy assessment. This huge task will need an army of energy assessors. A significant proportion of the housing stock is still uninsulated, with 9m UK homes in need of cavity wall insulation and 12m needing loft insulation. In London alone, that's over<br><a href=\"http://www.jeanlambertmep.org.uk/DocumentStore/Hothouses.pdf\">1m cavity walls and 1.5m lofts (pdf)</a>.</p> <p>It won't be a solution to all our problems, but a wide-scale free insulation programme could reduce energy bills by a third and slash carbon emissions. It would also create huge numbers of green jobs.</p> <p>There is massive potential for green jobs and training, but it's unclear whether the UK is ready to seize this opportunity. We have a serious green skills deficit and public investment in green training is sorely needed if we are to meet the climate change challenge and our green EU obligations. </p> <p>The green agenda is intrinsically linked to jobs, skills and economic issues. It will fail if not fully integrated into relating strategies and it must not be set up as a straw man in opposition to them. As the green work agenda becomes increasingly relevant, failure on green issues will also mean failure in terms of sustainable jobs, skills and investment in industry and manufacturing.</p> <p>The important work, the green work, still needs to be done.</p>",
  "<p>Turns out sleeping giants just need a little more time in the morning. After Sunday afternoon defeats to Genoa and Bologna over the first two weeks of the season, Milan finally shook off the rust on Thursday night with a 3-1 Uefa Cup win over FC Zurich at the San Siro. Yesterday they turned the first evening game of their Serie A campaign into their first points of the season with a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lNTuCFUi5I\">4-1 rout of Lazio</a>.</p> <p>\"Milan wake up,\" hurrahs Franco Ordine in Il Giornale this morning. \"They wake up whenever there is a concrete danger of becoming the championship's punchline. They wake up in an authoritative way that pleases their fans, putting on a performance that shows progress has been made and lessons committed to memory.\"</p> <p>Unfortunately that collective memory seems to be rather addled these days. \"Milan hit four goals to end crisis,\" trumpets the front page of Corriere dello Sport this morning, but to assume things will be better from here on is quite the leap of faith. Last year Milan opened the season with a 3-0 romp at Genoa and went on to win 5-1 at Lazio and 5-0 away to Sampdoria before the end of October. They lost or drew the other eight of their first 11 games.</p> <p>Besides, a glance at past results also tells us that Lazio haven't beaten Milan in Serie A since February 1998. They may have come into yesterday's game on the back of impressive wins over Cagliari and Sampdoria, but Lazio were still entered underdogs in most pundits' eyes \u2014 to the extent, in fact, that manager Delio Rossi felt moved to insist before kick-off that his side had not come to the San Siro as \"sacrificial lambs\".</p> <p>In the event that was what they became, ripped apart by a Milan side that for once seemed focused on the task in hand. Manager Carlo Ancelotti insisted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/sep/15/seriea.weekendreview\">last week</a> that his players always reacted well when his job came up for discussion, but in the end they responded even better to his decision to restore last season's 4-3-1-2 formation.</p> <p>There were voices of dissent in the stands as Ancelotti left both Ronaldinho and Andriy Shevchenko on the bench, but doing so allowed him to deploy Alexandre Pato and Marco Borriello together up front for the first time. He was rewarded with a goal from the former and a tireless, selfless performance from the latter. Ronaldinho's introduction may have drawn a roar of approval from the San Siro crowd, but by that stage Borriello had already won similar acclaim for tracking all the way back to the edge of his area to deny Cristian Ledesma a shooting chance for Lazio.</p> <p>Between them the two strikers added a degree of aggression and dynamism that Milan have lacked so far this season, while the formation also allowed Kak\u00e0 to return to a central role in behind those two strikers. As well as digging out a stunning strike for the fourth goal, Kak\u00e0 orchestrated the vast majority of Milan's best play. Ancelotti's enjoyment of his performance will only have been tempered by the knowledge of how heavily the team continues to rely on his brilliance.</p> <p>Then again, Lazio are fast coming to rely on their own South American forward for inspiration. Mauro Z\u00e1rate's strike to briefly level the scores at 1-1 was his fourth goal in three Serie A games. \"A constant danger,\" was Andrea Schianchi's verdict in Gazzetta dello Sport after watching the Argentine make good on his promise to score at the San Siro and Rossi will have a dilemma on his hands, albeit there are worse ones to have, once Tommaso Rocchi is fit to return up front.</p> <p>\"Lazio can't finish here, on the night when Milan's season started,\" insists Gazzetta dello Sport's Alberto Cerrutti. \"Because it's never too late to hope, and beating the big teams isn't the only thing you need to do to win the Scudetto. This is the one lesson that the most titled club in the world still needs to learn.\"</p> <h2>Round three talking points</h2> <p>\u00b7 Inter are beginning to gain momentum under Jose Mourinho, playing with better width, and more importantly a far greater joie de vivre than they ever did last season as they rolled to a 3-1 win over Torino. \"Maybe I am not the best in the world but I do think that no coach is better than me,\" reflected Mourinho in Saturday's Gazzetta, and regardless of what the rest of the world thinks, his players seem to be buying into such self-confidence.</p> <p>\u00b7 After Roma and Milan's poor starts, are Juventus the most likely team to challenge Inter for the title? Amauri scored his second match-winner in as many league games in a 1-0 win at Cagliari, and they did well to keep step with Inter despite the fact David Trezeguet, Alessandro Del Piero, Mauro Camoranesi and Cristiano Zanetti were all missing.</p> <p>\u00b7 Alberto Gilardino scored his fourth goal in three games \u2014 including his Champions League brace at Lyon \u2014 as Fiorentina beat Bologna 1-0. He said yesterday that he didn't want people to talk about him being \"reborn\" under Cesare Prandelli, but it's been a surprisingly quick return to form after he scored nine in all competitions for Milan last year.</p> <p>\u00b7 Three games in and there are no perfect records left in Serie A after Lazio's loss to Milan and as Atalanta slipped to a 1-0 defeat at Catania. Atalanta would likely still be joint-top of the table this morning had it not been for goalkeeper Ferdinando Coppola's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGgW2-tz-TU\">almighty clanger</a>, as he allowed an innocuous Michele Paolucci effort to squirm past him at the near post.</p> <h2>Results:</h2> <p>Cagliari 0-1 Juventus, Catania 1-0 Atalanta, Fiorentina 1-0 Bologna, Lecce 1-1 Siena, Milan 4-1 Lazio, Palermo 2-1 Genoa, Roma 3-0 Reggina, Sampdoria 1-1 Chievo, Torino 1-3 Inter, Udinese 0-0 Napoli.</p>",

  "<p>One in every 50 \u00a31 coins in circulation in the UK could be fake, it was reported today.</p> <p>The results of a sampling test by the Royal Mint, obtained by the BBC, show up to 2% of \u00a31 coins could be counterfeit - a total of 30m coins. </p> <p>The number appears to have doubled since the last time sampling test results were released in 2003, when the number of forged pounds coins was estimated to be 1%.</p> <p>Robert Matthews, formerly the Queen's assay master until he retired to become a coin consultant four years ago, said confidence in coins collapsed in other countries when forgery rates reached similar levels.</p> <p>He told the BBC: \"In 2004, people started refusing to take the South African 5 Rand coin due to concerns about the number of counterfeits, and eventually the coin had to be redesigned and recirculated.</p> <p>\"Independent surveys showed the number of counterfeits to be 2% - the same as we've got here - and I'm worried that if we're not careful the same thing will happen to the pound coin.\"</p> <p>In a statement the Royal Mint said: \"We track the counterfeit rate through regular surveys in the spring and autumn every year. The survey consists of taking a random sample of coins from across the country and subjecting them to individual analytical inspection.</p> <p>\"It is a criminal offence to make or use counterfeited coins. Any member of the public who suspects they have a counterfeited coin should not attempt to spend it.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the Mint added that anyone who found they had a fake coin in their wallet should hand it to the police. </p> <p>There are now almost 1.5bn \u00a31 coins in circulation in the UK. The coin, which is made of copper, nickel and zinc, was introduced in 1983 to provide a longer-lasting replacement for the \u00a31 note. </p> <p>While notes last an average of only nine months, a coin has a life expectancy of around 40 years.</p> <h2>How to spot a fake:</h2> <p>Check that the date and design match - the Royal Mint website has a <a href=\"http://www.royalmint.gov.uk/Corporate/BritishCoinage/CoinDesign/OnePoundCoin.aspx\">list showing the year that each design was introduced</a>. Many forgers get this wrong.</p> <p>Check that the edge inscription and date match - again you can find the list of inscriptions and their corresponding year on the Royal Mint site. Also check it is crisp and in the right lettering - forgeries often have writing that is uneven in depth and spacing. </p> <p>Check the Queen's head is the right depth - on some forgeries it protrudes too much, on others it is not deep enough.</p> <p>Check that the Queen's head lines up with the design on the reverse. Hold the coin between two fingers with the design straight and spin it round - if the Queen's head is off centre it is probably a fake.</p>",
  "<p>The inquest into the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes began at London's Oval cricket ground this morning with members of the dead man's family staging a quiet protest.</p> <p>Cousins of the Brazilian, who was shot dead as he attempted to catch a train at Stockwell tube station, handed out leaflets printed in the colours of the Brazilian flag and bearing the words \"Three Years, No Justice\". They wore T-shirts marking the date of his death \u2014 July 22 2005 \u2014 set inside the London Underground logo.</p> <p>A banner was hung from the window of a neighbouring flat emblazoned with the phrase \"Inquest not cover-up \u2014 Justice for Jean\". The hearing is being held less than a mile from where the electrician was shot.</p> <p>The 12-week inquest could have repercussions for Sir Ian Blair, the Metropolitan police commissioner, who is already in the midst of a race row within his ranks and faced with questions over the award of a contract to a friend. He could be forced to quit early if the inquest result is considered too damaging for him to see out his five-year term.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337854566\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/09/22/menezes140.jpg\" alt=\"Jean Charles de Menezes\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jean Charles de Menezes. Photograph: AFP/Getty</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The coroner, Sir Michael Wright, a former high court judge, told the six women and five men of the jury they must reach their conclusions of what happened on the day de Menezes was killed. He said: \"It must be stated at the outset of this inquest with the greatest possible emphasis that in truth Mr De Menezes was in no way associated with bombs, explosions or any form of terrorism.</p> <p>\"The person of whose death we are here to inquire is Jean Charles de Menezes, a Brazilian citizen who was aged 27 when he died. He met his death at about 10.06am on the morning of July 22 2005, in an underground train, which was stationary at platform two at Stockwell underground station.</p> <p>\"He died as he was shot by two specialist firearms officers of the Metropolitan police. According to them, they shot him because they believed he was a suicide bomber capable of detonating and intending to detonate an improvised explosive device on the underground system.\"</p> <p>The inquest will be the first time the de Menezes family, represented by Michael Mansfield QC, will be given the opportunity to question those involved in the killing. De Menezes' parents will travel to London next month and will be able to confront the two CO19 firearms officers who fired the fatal shots when they give evidence for the first time.</p> <p>The officers, known as C2 and C12, will be screened from the public but the family will be able to see them during cross-examination.</p> <p>The hearing will examine the events of the day de Menezes was shot. He had just boarded a train at Stockwell when he was pinned down and shot seven times in the head at point-blank range. The killing happened the day after four men attempted to explode rucksack bombs on the tube \u2014 a plan that failed \u2014 and two weeks after the July 7 bombings.</p> <p>Sir Michael took jurors on a step-by-step account of the police operation surrounding flats in Scotia Road where de Menezes lived. Two surveillance teams had formed an inner and outer cordon around the block of nine flats. At Scotland Yard, a senior firearms officer told colleagues that \"unusual tactics\" might be necessary. </p> <p>Sir Michael told the jury: \"It would appear that some of the officers took this to mean that a critical, in other words, fatal shot might have to be fired. This belief was based on a police operational strategy for dealing with suicide bombers known as Operation Kratos.\" </p> <p>At a second briefing, the firearms officers were told the missing terrorists could hide bombs on their bodies and were \"deadly and determined\" and \"up for it\". <br> None of the officers who pursued de Menezes was able to positively identify Hussain Osman, the terrorist suspect they were looking for. At Scotland Yard, contradictory messages were recorded by loggists acting on behalf of the senior officers overseeing the operation. One noted that the man had been discounted and surveillance teams should withdraw to their original positions. </p> <p>A loggist for Commander Cressida Dick, who was in charge, wrote: \"It is him. The man is off the bus. They think it is him and he is very, very jumpy.\" </p> <p>The coroner said de Menezes got off the No 2 bus outside Brixton tube station but jumped back on board when he realised the station was closed. </p> <p>Moments later an unarmed detective behind the bus was ready to pull it over and arrest the suspect. But he was ordered to stand down after CO19 firearms teams said they had been deployed.</p> <p>De Menezes went into Stockwell tube station followed by five surveillance officers, identified to the jury as Ivor, Ken, Laurence, Malcolm and Geoff. The first of about a dozen CO19 firearms officers arrived at the scene about a minute later and rushed into the station. Some vaulted over the ticket barriers while others pushed through them. </p> <p>The coroner said: \"It does appear that by the time Mr de Menezes had actually entered the underground system at Stockwell station, no member of the surveillance team had positively identified him as Osman. But at New Scotland Yard there does appear to have been a perception that Mr de Menezes had been positively identified as Osman. Commander Dick was deeply concerned that he should not be allowed to go down into the underground station.\" </p> <p>The firearms specialists sent to the scene also believed de Menezes was their suspect. </p> <p>One of the officers, identified as Ralph, recalled hearing over the surveillance radio the message \"It's definitely our man\", and that he was \"nervous and twitchy\". </p> <p>Sir Michael told the jury: \"It will be for you to consider what level of identification was made at different stages, what was communicated to the firearms officers, and what those officers believed the position to be.\" </p> <p>De Menezes got on a northbound Northern line train and Ivor, a surveillance officer, sat down next to him. As the firearms officers reached the platform Ivor got up from his seat, held open the train doors and shouted, \"He's here\". </p> <p>As de Menezes got up and walked towards the police, Ivor grabbed him around his body and pushed him back into his seat. At this point the first two firearms officers \u2014 identified only as Charlie 2 and Charlie 12 \u2014 entered the carriage. </p> <p>The coroner said: \"Both officers state that they were convinced Mr de Menezes was a suicide bomber, that he was about to detonate a bomb and unless he was prevented from so doing everybody present in that carriage was going to die. </p> <p>\"Each officer says he was convinced that an instant killing was the only option open to him. Each reached over Ivor and fired several times at point-blank range into Mr de Menezes's head.\" </p> <p>Sir Michael said de Menezes was killed instantly, adding: \"He can hardly have had any opportunity to appreciate what was happening.\" </p> <p>A postmortem revealed that de Menezes had been shot seven times in the head.</p> <p>The inquest will hear from surveillance officers who followed the deceased from his flat to the tube station, along with commuters who were on the train carriage at Stockwell and witnessed the shooting.</p> <p>A key witness on the family's side is expected to be Brian Paddick, the former deputy assistant commissioner in the Met, who disputed the commissioner's version of events in the aftermath of the shooting. He subsequently left the force.</p> <p>As the first day drew to a close, Patricia da Silva Armani, a cousin of de Menezes, said she hoped a \"long and painful few months\" would reveal the truth of what had happened. </p> <p>\"Today is the first day and we hope it will bring our family closer to the truth. We are hoping that at the end we will get closer to knowing how my cousin died,\" she said. \"Hearing it again brought back the pain and anguish since Jean's death. This will be a long and painful few months but we will be here until the end to get the truth.\"</p> <p>The Independent Police Complaints Commission has carried out two inquiries. The Met was found guilty of breaching health and safety laws in a crown court trial last year. The case highlighted a string of errors that resulted in unwarranted risk to the public and in de Menezes' death.</p> <p>No police officer has faced a criminal charge over the killing, which has angered the family.</p>",
  "<p>As Labour postpones its big leadership showdown \u2013 the smart money is now that it will happen after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/21/glenrothes.labour\">Glenrothes byelection</a> \u2013 there's plenty of talk of various organised party plotters: there's a Scottish mafia, of course, a Lancashire mafia and a north-east mafia, apparently. But noticeably silent has been another key part of the Labour tribe: the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/wales\">Taffia</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.welshlabour.org.uk/\">Welsh Labour</a> has been Brownite for longer than most of its MPs can remember: several were involved in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/sep/05/uk.labourleadership\">outbreak of letter-writing</a> two years ago that prompted Tony Blair to leave and brought their man to Downing Street.</p> <p>Small wonder that they've stayed loyal, perhaps; they'd look daft doing anything else. But also striking is the way the Blairites in the Welsh PLP (there are some) are sticking to the script too \u2013 calculating that a leadership election brings more divisions, and a longer stint in opposition too, the way things are going. MPs and assembly members report post-summer holiday tellings off from constituency parties, angry that leadership speculation is getting out of control.</p> <p>Hence the rallying cry from the normally measured Welsh secretary Paul Murphy from the podium yesterday. Brown was \"as determined and purposeful\" as any Labour leader in history, he said, in a short address that still managed to fit in three uses of the word \"socialism\".</p> <p>Missing from the conference this year, for the first time in 40 years, is first minister <a href=\"http://new.wales.gov.uk/about/cabinet/cabinetm/rhodrimorgan?lang=en\">Rhodri Morgan</a>. Morgan is performing a Boris-style function at the Ryder Cup in Kentucky, receiving the baton for the 2010 re-match, to be held in Newport. Before flying out, the first minister had some characteristic words to impart on the leadership situation. Anyone plotting to remove Brown was \"insane\", Morgan concluded.</p> <p>Welsh Labour suffers one crucial advantage compared to the party in Scotland. While Scottish Labour is bashed from all sides by Alex Salmond's SNP, Welsh Labour is in coalition with Plaid Cymru in the Welsh assembly. Pundits and politicians alike are taken aback by how smoothly the so-called \"One Wales\" government has operated. Peter Hain, never Morgan's closest friend and a man unafraid of telling Welsh ministers they were wrong, is out of the Wales Office, replaced by the steady-as-she-goes Murphy. The Torfaen MP is an old pal of Morgan's \u2013 he arrived at the first Cardiff Bay photocall in January to be greeted by the first minister of Wales saying: \"Hiya Byt!\" \u2013 the Welsh equivalent of \"mate\".</p> <p>Brown repaid the favour with a warm tribute, and a few jokes, at conference \"Welsh night\" on Sunday. There was even whooping from the delegates \u2013 although that might have been the wine. If the PM is forced out, don't expect to see a Welsh finger on the trigger.</p>",

Nearly 13,000 people remain in hospital after drinking milk products that contained melamine. Four children have died and more than 100 are seriously ill.</p> <p>Amid growing public outcry, Wen Jiabao, the Chinese premier, visited hospitals in Beijing over the weekend and threatened harsh punishment for the culprits.</p> <p>\"The public is worried, doctors are worried, and we're also worried,\" he said, according to Xinhua.</p> <p>\"What we are trying to do is to ensure no such event happens in future, by punishing those responsible. None of those companies lacking professional ethics or social morals will be let off.</p> <p>\"The most crucial point is that after a clean-up there can be no problems at all with newly produced milk products. If there are fresh problems, they must be even more sternly punished under the law.\"</p> <p>Melamine is used to make plastic and is high in nitrogen, which makes products appear to have a high protein count. It is thought some raw milk suppliers watered down their milk to boost the volume and then added melamine to disguise this.</p> <p>Ingesting small amounts of melamine is not thought to cause harm, but sustained consumption can cause kidney stones and renal failure, especially in children. Most of the victims are under two years old.</p> <p>The World Health Organisation today called for stricter monitoring of the industry after it emerged that Sanlu Group, China's biggest infant milk powder producer, knew of the problems with melamine for more than a month but the information was kept quiet while Beijing hosted the Olympics.</p> <p>Hans Troedsson, a WHO representative, said: \"It is important to know if information was withheld, where and why it was withheld. Was it ignorance by provincial authorities or was it that they neglected to report it? If it was ignorance there is a need to have much better training and education. If it is neglect then it is of course more serious.\"</p> <p>Japan, Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan are among Asian countries that have banned or recalled Chinese milk products. </p> <p>Hong Kong is thought to have discovered its first victim: a three-year-old girl diagnosed with a kidney stone at the weekend. She had drunk two glasses a day of a high-calcium, low-fat milk product for more than a year. Other children in the territory are being tested.</p> <p>The government has promised free treatment for affected children, but parents are worried about long-term illness and doctors' bills.</p> <p>The scandal is hurting dairy farmers. The Chinese ministry of agriculture said despairing farmers were dumping milk and killing their cattle after companies stopped buying their supplies. The ministry has promised them subsidies.</p>",

  "<p>We are told that the economic crisis is a global problem, nothing to do with the UK \u2013 it simply blew in unexpectedly from the US. Nonsense. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/19/subprimecrisis.richardbitner\">subprime housing market</a> crisis certainly blew up first in the US, but all the makings of the crisis were already deeply embedded in UK and European financial markets and would have blown up here without any promptings from the US. The de-regulatory, free-wheeling market agenda was already as strongly installed in the City of London as in the US; securitisation was as rampant in the City as on Wall Street, and UK mortgages were increasingly being marketed in the UK on a 6:1, even 10:1, debt to income ratio. The US has nothing to teach the City about subprime or about arcane derivatives.</p> <p>Second, the left cannot contain itself with glee over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/22/wallstreet.marketturmoil\">Hank Paulson's</a> \"nationalisation\" of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/freddiemacandfanniemae\">Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae</a>, AIG, and the state-run <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/21/useconomy.subprimecrisis\">Resolution Trust Corporation</a>, designed to sweep up the crippled Wall Street failures under the protective wing of the state. Private market Armageddon, and state control triumphant. It is nothing of the kind.</p> <p>Actually it reveals the reverse. Once the finance catastrophe is past (which may take a year or two) and all the colossal banking losses have been safely socialised with the taxpayer, the private market will re-present itself \u2013 slightly reconfigured no doubt by some minimalist re-regulation \u2013 as the natural delivery mechanism for the next splurge of global capitalist growth. Whatever limitations have been placed by Gordon Brown's \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/22/gordonbrown.economy\">cleaning up the City</a>\", the race will then be on to find a way round them and to renew the culture of mega-bonuses for the few at the expense of the many. After 1929 and the second world war, it happened in the 1950-60s until it was stopped by the oil shocks of 1971-3, then it happened again in the 1980s until the US savings and loans associations crumbled between 1989-95, and then it took off again with the securitisation scam until the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/northernrock\">Northern Rock</a> collapse on August 9 2007.</p> <p>It will start yet again within the next five years because the culture has not changed one jot and the driving force remains maximum enrichment by the largest amalgamations of capital (increasingly in the hands of secretive private equity and hedge funds uninhibited by even the limited transparency of public companies), shielded by their close harmony with political leaders. All the US nationalised companies with be returned to the private sector as quickly as feasible, as will Northern Rock. Public ownership is seen as a despised necessity, an unfortunate interregnum in the endless drive for private profit, and a temporary refuge to be milked for all it is worth for as little time as it is required. Hardly a triumph for those who believe in it. </p> <p>Instead of the left preening itself that this capitalist debacle leaves events falling into its lap, it needs to realise that there is still a mountain to climb before the culture is transformed. The intellectual conspirators of St Pelerin in Geneva in 1947 took over 30 years to get their neoliberal philosophy to take root. The left today have hardly started. The need for a profound, wide-ranging, persisting, in-depth intellectual and political debate on the realities of an alternative world economic order has never been greater.</p>",

  "<p>Britain is a nation of museums, where they have collected everything worth collecting. A good museum typically requires generations of hard work. With long and careful planning the British have plundered collectibles from Egypt, India and Mexico, from China, and all corners of the world, carting valuables home like tireless ants. They spent no small amount of taxpayers\u2019 money doing this, and they have spent even more on preservation.</p> <p>They were spending pounds sterling, and everyone knows how far the pound goes.</p> <p>Of course, their first priority was collecting all the valuables of their own nation - that\u2019s the way it always is. Their best-preserved item is the British royal family, ie the Queen. This family is ancient, and by now a little eccentric; like all the world\u2019s most celebrated families, its descendants want nothing so much as to up and vanish like drops of water returning to the sea. Unfortunately for them they were born in Britain, where this human right is denied to them. The British nation spends vast sums every year maintaining the royal family in luxury, so that they can be revered by the British people and tourists from around the world. The money probably isn\u2019t as important as the feeling: maintaining the royal family\u2019s identity as the centre of Britain, even of the entire world. It\u2019s a hopeless task, and it\u2019s hard to imagine another country devoting so much effort to such an absurd business.<br>Some people believe the British royal family arranged for the death of Princess Diana. I don\u2019t think so: there wasn\u2019t any need for Buckingham Palace to do it, nor do I think they had the resources. But Princess Diana\u2019s behaviour was ruining the most precious item ever to grace Britain\u2019s collection, and I imagine this was a great distress to those keen on this particular item. That much is for sure.</p> <p>We Chinese know all about the distress collecting can bring. In 1860, more than 3,000 British gentlemen broke into China\u2019s Yuanmingyuan and carted off countless unmatched treasures before putting it to the torch. In 1900 they returned, once again carting off countless treasures, and once again putting it to the torch. Many Chinese cultural heritage experts, returning from visits to British museums, say that the British have impeccable taste when it comes to collecting - they only took the good stuff. Many Chinese can\u2019t understand why the British had to burn things down when they were finished looting, it seems entirely gratuitous. To be honest, it may be a good thing that those artifacts are all being kept in Britain, as they\u2019ll be better preserved there. But why start the fires? For this the Chinese have never forgiven the British.</p> <p>In order to gain a little favour with the Chinese, the British government returned Hong Kong to China, lock, stock and barrel. Old man Patten, who had just been relieved of the governorship of Hong Kong, and Prince Charles, who had just been divorced, secretly departed Hong Kong in a small fishing boat in the middle of the night on June 30, 1997. Yet still the Chinese are unhappy: why did you have to burn it down?</p> <p>There\u2019s only one reasonable explanation for this; it also has to do with collecting. Yuanmingyuan and the Summer Palace were not merely the residences of the Empress Dowager Cixi and the emperor, they were chiefly museums - at that time some of the biggest museums in the Far East, even the world. They were unique and unrivalled, both in terms of their collections and the design of the displays. This was an affront to the far-ranging British, who could not accept that the world held better museums than theirs, or more avid collectors than they. So they burnt Yuanmingyuan to ensure their pre-eminence in the world of collecting.</p> <p>But even the British collectors have lapses in judgment, and they left behind something that should not have been forgotten, something truly unique: the last emperor of China, Aisin Gioro Puyi. As the last ruler of China\u2019s feudal dynasties, his line had stretched over 400 years, but he came to a very bitter end, all because the British neglected to add him to their collection. After being driven out of the Forbidden City he passed some unhappy time in Tianjin and north-eastern China before the Soviets grabbed him. Of course he was part of the Japanese collection for part of that time, but he was never satisfied with the price the Japanese had paid for him. In 1949 he was sent back to China, and underwent 10 years of Communist education at the Fushun War Crimes Re-education Centre. By the time he was granted pardon in 1959 Puyi was already 52 years old. He was introduced to an old maid, Li Shuxian, and the two were married. By this time the Party and government realised the importance of preserving the line of the dragon - which is to say they understood the importance of collecting - and they wished that the last emperor might produce an heir. Prime minister Zhou Enlai personally made inquiries into the matter but, sadly, Puyi was already impotent. New China\u2019s medical resources were terribly behind the times, and all they could think to do was give him hormone shots. After receiving the shots the emperor would go bounding home, but still it came to nothing - the more shots they gave him, the worse off he became. So the long line of Chinese emperors came to an end. If this had been Britain, I\u2019m sure they could have thought of something.</p> <p>While we\u2019re on the subject, Puyi himself was also something of a collector. He was a collector of a very particular sort. He, along with his brother Aisin Gioro Pujie, brazenly looted the collection of his forefathers from the Forbidden City. The exact numbers are hard to estimate, but the items included gifts from the British royal family to the Qing emperors. He lived by selling off these treasures, and when the time came to flee he threw away what he couldn\u2019t carry. He caused the ruin of very many items. Later he donated a great number to Stalin in the name of \u201csupporting the development of the Soviet economy\u201d; actually he was buying his own life. By the time he found himself in Fushun he still had three great leather chests full of treasures; of course every one of these was handed over to the nation. The government, mindful of his remaining days, allowed him to retain a single item for his personal use. Puyi chose nothing rare or priceless for himself, only a cheap gold-plated watch from France. It wasn\u2019t even a part of the Forbidden City collection, it was something he\u2019d bought from Ullmann &amp; Co in 1924, as he fled through Beijing from the Prince Chun Mansion to the Japanese embassy. Clearly he had lost interest in being a collector - perhaps he had already come to realise the dangers of the pursuit.</p> <p>A good collector would sell his soul to add to his collection; Puyi only thought to sell his collection in order to preserve his own skin.</p> <p>It\u2019s no surprise - the Chinese are actually no great collectors. They mostly love new things, the newer the better. In households throughout the countryside, the labour of a whole generation may be spent in tearing down an old home and replacing it with a new tile-roofed house. If a family is still living in the house of their ancestors it\u2019s a great loss of face. I\u2019ve heard that plenty of regular people in England are living in three- or four-hundred-year-old houses - good lord, they\u2019re practically living in the Forbidden City! The Chinese would never live in buildings like that - according to tradition, old buildings are haunted.</p> <p>Furthermore, the Chinese don\u2019t have the means for collection. We\u2019re a developing country- it may look like we\u2019ve got plenty of space and resources, but divide it all by a population of 1.3 billion and we\u2019ve barely got enough pairs of pants to go around. Everyone knows that China collects giant pandas, but this collection alone is a major strain on the national finances. To be honest, we can\u2019t actually afford the furry things. So the government encourages private citizens to adopt them - a friend of mine with plenty of money did it. He spent more than 200,000 yuan a year, but he couldn\u2019t even take the panda home, he was only permitted to have a commemorative photograph taken with it. This struck him as a bad deal, and he gave it up after the first year. To resolve the financial burden of their panda collection the Chinese came up with another idea - giving them away as gifts. The first chance they get, Chinese leaders will bestow a panda on other nations, particularly developed nations. The recipients are all tremendously grateful, because they know pandas are the national treasure of China. But in truth they\u2019ve been duped: they are obliged to put huge amounts of labour and resources into researching pandas and all their various needs. The Americans were the first to fall for it. Two years ago Mainland China tried to gift Taiwan with two cute pandas, \u201cTuantuan\u201d and \u201cYuanyuan\u201d, but the Taiwanese (who are also Chinese) were far too sharp, and saw right through the trick - they declined the gift.</p> <p>The British truly understand collecting, and they\u2019ve got the means to do it. They even collect human beings. They say that if you buy a cup of coffee and sit on the corner of Oxford Street, you can see people from more than 140 different countries. They\u2019ve got all colours, all faiths. The British government has to adjust its immigration policies every year in order to preserve the proper balance of races.</p> <p>Of course they also collect political dissidents. Any open, civilised society must maintain a certain quantity of political dissidents. The Dalai Lama has been part of the collection for many years, but it\u2019s time now to bring him out and put him on the auction block. In the past I\u2019ve also thought about trying to get on the list, and enjoy the status of being a collector\u2019s item. But really, being a political dissident is just too easy these days. A little criticism of current affairs, a little cursing of the government - to me it\u2019s both thrilling, and also perfectly safe. To be honest I\u2019d love to curse the Communist Party, but it\u2019s a bit late for that now. The Party has already wised up; they\u2019ve realised that allowing people to curse them without reprisal is a great display of their high-mindedness. The more you curse, the more enlightened they look. Christ, you might as well just start praising them. In the next 50 years, the prospects for political dissidence in China look very dim indeed. No one will bother collecting us, not even the oldest and grandest of the imperialist nations - Great Britain. When the British government decides it\u2019s time to do business with China, no one will give us a second thought.</p> <p>In the spring of 2008 I received an unexpected invitation to visit Britain. More than a decade ago I wrote a book called I Love Dollars. It was banned in China at the time, and was fairly well-known. If it hadn\u2019t been banned, I doubt whether it would have been quite so well-known. It\u2019s the story of a son who helps his father go through the streets looking for women - highly challenging to the traditional morality of the Chinese people. To be honest this book caused me a lot of problems because it was narrated in the first person, and critics and readers assumed it was autobiographical; my father and I both lost our reputations. Just when I was finally forgetting the whole thing, the English version of I Love Dollars was published in America and became quite popular, even garnering a nomination for an international literary prize. A British cultural organisation got my phone number from the British embassy in China, and asked me if I could write a book called I Love Pounds. If I was interested, they would pay my way for a trip to England.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t respond right away, first because of my unpleasant memories of I Love Dollars, second because I\u2019ve never taken writing lightly. The next day I went to the Beijing branch of the Bank of China to check that day\u2019s exchange rates, and saw that the British pound sterling was worth almost two American dollars! Who wouldn\u2019t love pounds? But even so I made no rash decisions - I only exchanged a few notes to take home with me. I exchanged a total of 85 pounds, one each of the 50, 20, 10 and five-pound denominations. Back home I laid these notes on my desk and stared for a long time at the image of the Queen. I asked myself if I were capable of any true feelings for this particular currency. One week later I had still experienced no emotion. I prepared my answer to the British: I\u2019m very sorry, I won\u2019t be able to write I Love Pounds, maybe you could try Ha Jin. The name of this Chinese writer, winner of the National Book Award in America, could be translated as \u201cLikes Money\u201d.</p> <p>I had picked up the phone and dialled a long string of numbers, and was waiting for the call to go through, when I suddenly noticed the 50-pound note, and a small line to the upper left of the Queen\u2019s head: I PROMISE TO PAY THE BEARER ON DEMAND THE SUM OF... I had the ghostly sensation that the Queen herself was speaking to me, in tones which, though lacking intimacy, removed all possibility of doubt. In that instant, I found my inspiration.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been working steadily on I Love Pounds since my return from England, and if this book is successful it may even result in my being collected - who can say? Good fortune is like bird shit, it falls on whom it will. The most you can hope for is a bald head, so that when it lands you know it all the more clearly.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 Translated from the Chinese by Eric Abrahamsen<br></strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 The poet and novelist Bernardine Evaristo, who travelled to China earlier this year, picks up the baton next month with a short story of her own</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 The China Reflected series is published with the generous support of Arts Council England</strong></p>",
  "<p>Any day now, my son, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/aug/29/hacking.law\">Gary McKinnon</a>, could face extradition from Britain to the United States, where he would stand trial for hacking into US government computers and could face a sentence of up to 60 years. </p> <p>Gary has recently been diagnosed with <a href=\"http://www.nas.org.uk/asperger\">Asperger's syndrome</a>, which is why I and his family and his many friends and supporters around the world are arguing that he should be allowed to stay in the UK and face the courts in the country where the offence \u2013 if offence there was \u2013 was committed.</p> <p>The US authorities waited two years to call for Gary's arrest because of a then-unratified, unsigned extradition treaty between the two countries, which would make it easier for them to have a British citizen sent for trial in the US. Yet, when he was first arrested in London, six years ago now, Gary was told he would probably get a sentence of <a href=\"http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2225136/mckinnon-supporters-cause-home\">community service</a> for his hacking activities. </p> <p>He naively admitted computer misuse before he had engaged a lawyer and without a lawyer even being present. We were still unaware at that time that he had Asperger's syndrome.</p> <p>Gary gained no leniency for his honesty and on the contrary, his extradition has been relentlessly pursued by the British and American authorities, despite the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) declining to prosecute him in Britain. This attitude will hardly encourage British citizens to come clean regarding any crimes they may have committed. If no leniency or consideration is given when a person accused of a crime immediately and openly tells the truth, there is little point in them admitting to anything.</p> <p>The CPS's decision not to prosecute Gary here was clearly made to allow the Americans to arrest him two-and-a-half years later, once the one-sided extradition treaty was introduced and then made retrospective.</p> <p>In addition, in order to indict Gary, the US authorities had to claim a specific amount of financial damage. Gary has always denied causing damage and without proof of such, the US could not prosecute him. Just a month ago the US prosecutors stated in an interview that once Gary was extradited, the most difficult thing to prove would be the damage!</p> <p>Several weeks ago the goalposts were moved yet again when the US introduced a new law whereby no proof of damage was required where military computers were concerned. For the American law to then have been conveniently changed at such a crucial time does little to give us any faith in such a legal system.<br> There is a London demonstration <a href=\"http://www.usembassy.org.uk/ukembmap.html\">outside the US embassy</a>, scheduled for 4pm on September 28 in Grosvenor Square.

  "<p>In her yearly assessment of the state of our proud little Dutch nation Queen Beatrix mentioned all sorts of trivialities last week. In a nutshell: economy pretty good, war in Afghanistan necessary, crime bad. But she failed to mention the most important thing of all: the state of Dutch football. </p> <p>The first days of Champions League and UEFA Cup action painted a picture more grim than those in which the old Dutch masters specialized. PSV were <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_zVyw6dBTg&amp;feature=related\">battered 3-0</a> by a not overly impressive Atl\u00e9tico Madrid on Tuesday. Atl\u00e9tico striker Sergio Ag\u00fcero scored twice and had a field day against J\u00e9r\u00e9my Br\u00e9chet who confirmed that Inter were quite right to give up on him four years ago. </p> <p>\"After a hopeless 3-0 loss in a group that also contains Liverpool and Marseille, PSV may hardly hope to survive the winter in the Champions League,\" NRC Handelsblad's Koen Greven wrote. \"That can be called a painful conclusion for a club that likes to count itself among Europe's best \u2026 As the match went on, it became apparent how big the difference is between Europe's [top leagues] and the Eredivisie.\"</p> <p>On Thursday, Ajax played an appalling match against an unworthy opponent, FK Borac, who struggled to cobble two decent passes together. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7marM_-79EM\">Though Ajax went on to win 4-1</a> against the Serbian side, that their opponents even got on the scoresheet was nothing less than humiliating. On the bright side there was a stunning goal by Luis Suarez and the continued progression of recent mega purchase Miralem Sulejmani, who could well develop into a low-fat, high-octane version of Rafael van der Vaart.</p> <p>After the sobering realisation that, in European club football, the Dutch have slowly become a dwarf-nation where once we were a giant, it came time for Ajax and Feyenoord - <a href=\"http://nl.youtube.com/watch?v=saGbpLF-8IE\">who hadn't helped matters by losing to Swedish club Kalmar FF 1-0 at home on Thursday</a> - to jostle for bragging rights in Sunday's classic. </p> <p>In a deafening Kuip, <a href=\"http://www.nrc.nl/multimedia/archive/00172/3D_maas_update-groo_172063a.jpg\">which Feyenoord would like to replace with a floating stadium</a> in time for a possible Dutch-Belgian 2018 World Cup (and perhaps global warming's submerging of the Netherlands), the two best supported clubs in the nation played a riveting if fairly poor match.</p> <p>Feyenoord, whose midfield had an average age of 19, held Ajax to what was probably <a href=\"http://nl.youtube.com/watch?v=QWyXc6M83JE\">a fair 2-2 draw</a>. How the result came about, though, was anything but fair as referee Eric Braamhaar had a nightmare of a game, seemingly confusing yellow cards with red ones and penalties with dives. Jeffrey Sarpong and Klaas Jan Huntelaar twice put Ajax ahead while Jon Dahl Tomasson retorted with equalisers each time: once with a header and once through a wrongly awarded penalty, given when Michael Mols and his floppy boyband haircut were nudged allowing him to gladly embrace gravity. </p> <p>Ajax captain Huntelaar couldn't make up his mind between blaming his own team or the ref in his post-match interview. \"If you don't dare give a penalty or a red card [against Feyenoord] I wonder what you're doing here,\" he finally decided. \"I'm very impressed by the poor performance of that ref.\" Yet, somehow, Braamhaar defended the indefensible. \"In my view I got it right,\" he said to virtually everyone's incredulity. </p> <p>\"The supporters' cynicism was fed by the poor showing on Thursday. Feyenoord's return to the European stage turned into a failure. The blueprint for another season of disillusion was drawn up,\" Geert Langendorff wrote in Trouw. \"[But] the tie with eternal rival Ajax brought out the best in Feyenoord \u2026 which deservedly but unexpectedly got a point from the 'classic.'\"</p> <p>\"It just doesn't look like football, what Feyenoord do,\" pundit Johan Derksen had said about Feyenoord's European misadventure earlier in the week. It hadn't looked much better on Sunday but at least there was the excuse that captain Giovanni van Bronckhorst had been injured when bumping heads with a Kalmarian. \"He's sort of seeing double,\" smiled his unconcerned manager Gertjan Verbeek before the match. \"And that's tricky isn't it? Two balls?\"</p> <p>After <a href=\"http://nl.youtube.com/watch?v=tkpUK22AyFc\">losing to Stade Rennes 2-1 in mid-week</a> Steve McClaren had proclaimed it \"not a bad result,\" before, presumably, being fitted with a straight-jacket. But on Sunday, at long last, his Twente team claimed their first win in six attempts, beating pitiful Volendam 2-1. </p> <p>And in the weekend's other big match-up Louis van Gaal's previously winless AZ handed PSV their second defeat of the week, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO3hB33x1_A\">earning a 1-0 result</a> on Saturday courtesy of a strike by Belgian Maarten Martens. </p> <p>Van Gaal, who wanted to resign midway through last season but was convinced not to by his squad, had once again been fighting for his job beforehand and many were wondering if his magic had run out. The former schoolteacher's dictatorial approach has often led to friction with the liberally raised and uninhibited Generation Y. So strict was his control at Ajax that he had even drawn up rules for every position. Wingers for example were never to try to dribble past more than one man per attack. However this was a deserved victory over what was an inferior PSV side.</p> <p>\"Like against Atl\u00e9tico and to some extent Sparta Rotterdam, PSV appeared powerless,\" De Telegraaf wrote. \"The days where everything went naturally for the Eindhovenaars, who were Dutch champions the last four years in a row, seems over for now.\" </p> <p>So it seems that, once again, though many bridges need to be built internationally, the Dutch domestic league is still more than capable of throwing up both surprises and fun in equal abundance.

He wore prison-issue orange shorts and T-shirt with the number 8 chalked on the back.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337851132\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/09/22/bout220.jpg\" alt=\"Viktor Bout gestures from his Bangkok court cell\" width=\"220\" height=\"427\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Viktor Bout gestures from his Bangkok court cell.

He said nothing as he arrived for the hearing, which had been repeatedly delayed.</p> <p>His defence lawyer, Preecha Prasertsak, announced he had petitioned the court to dismiss the proceedings on four terrorism conspiracy counts filed in the US on the grounds the former Soviet air force officer had been held illegally.</p> <p>The judges adjourned for 30 minutes but then said they would consider Preecha's appeal at another hearing to be fixed later. \"My client is innocent,\" Preecha said.</p> <p>Bout has denied any wrongdoing. He has long been one of the world's most wanted men for arms smuggling. He has a reputation for busting UN weapons embargoes to supply infamous warlords like Liberia's Charles Taylor.</p> <p>If extradited to the US and convicted he faces life imprisonment on indictments including conspiracy to kill US citizens and providing material support to terrorists.</p> <p>The charges are based on conversations recorded at a Bangkok luxury hotel in March between Bout and US Drug Enforcement Agency agents who were posing as Colombian Farc rebels. Washington lists Farc as a terrorist group.</p> <p>US prosecutors allege Bout offered to supply 700 surface-to-air missiles, guns, state-of-the-art helicopters and aircraft capable of firing missiles. The undercover agents had penetrated Bout's inner circle and won his trust, prosecutors say.</p> <p>Bout maintains he has been held unlawfully on \"fabricated American accusations\". He stands accused of being a global gun-runner to Africa, the Middle East and South America, running a fleet of cargo planes since the early 1990s. His exploits were the template for the 2005 movie Lord of War, in which Nicolas Cage portrayed a Russian arms smuggler.</p> <p>The Thai extradition proceedings became bogged down after Bout lost several lawyers. A June hearing was cancelled when his solicitor failed to show up complaining of heart problems, while a July date went the same way when the court-appointed lawyer said he had clashing cases and did not appear.</p> <p>The hearings are due to be wrapped up by early next month when Bout's defence will get its chance to present witnesses and evidence to counter the charges.</p>",
  "<p>Contaminated milk has poisoned 54,000 children in China at last count, according to officials.</p> <p>Nearly 13,000 remain in hospital after drinking milk products that contained the industrial chemical melamine. Four children have died and more than 100 are seriously ill.</p> <p>Amid growing public outcry, Wen Jiabao, the Chinese premier, visited hospitals in Beijing over the weekend and threatened harsh punishment for the culprits.</p> <p>\"The public is worried, doctors are worried, and we're also worried,\" he said, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.</p> <p>\"What we are trying to do is to ensure no such event happens in future, by punishing those responsible. None of those companies lacking professional ethics or social morals will be let off.</p> <p>\"The most crucial point is that after a clean-up there can be no problems at all with newly produced milk products. If there are fresh problems, they must be even more sternly punished under the law.\"</p> <p>Japan, Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan are among Asian countries that have banned or recalled Chinese milk products. Melamine was found in products from China's three biggest dairy companies.</p> <p>The chemical is used to make plastics and is high in nitrogen, which makes products appear to have a high protein count. Ingesting small amounts is not thought to cause harm, but sustained consumption can cause kidney stones and renal failure, especially in children. Most of the victims are under two years old.</p> <p>Hong Kong is thought to have discovered its first victim: a three-year-old girl diagnosed with a kidney stone at the weekend. She had drunk two glasses a day of a high-calcium, low-fat milk product for more than a year. Other children in the territory are being tested.</p> <p>The Sanlu Group, China's biggest infant milk powder producer, knew of the problems with melamine for more than a month but kept quiet while Beijing hosted the Olympics.</p> <p>The government has promised free treatment for affected children, but parents are worried about long-term illness and doctors' bills.</p> <p>The scandal is hitting the farming industry. The Chinese ministry of agriculture said despairing farmers were dumping milk and killing their cattle after companies stopped buying their supplies. The ministry has promised subsidies to prop them up.</p> <p>The milk scandal has again shaken trust in Chinese products after scares last year over toxic and shoddy goods ranging from toothpaste and drugs to pet food and toys.</p>",
  "<p>So, we've come to the end of the try-outs, and the last of the auditions proved that you can not only get through by having the X Factor, but that the sex factor works quite well too. </p> <p>Having two women on the judge's panel means that boys, as well as girls, can play on their looks. In a previous audition stunning Josef had Cheryl and Dannii swooning. He could have sung the phone book and they would have put him through. </p> <p>In Saturday's show it was the turn of the senior citizen as 66-year-old court usher Betty Brice wooed the judges with Black Lace's Gang Bang. The sex factor put Betty through to the next stage of auditions, but I couldn't help wondering what's going to happen when they put her in a girl group with unsuspecting auditionees in the bootcamp. But that didn't worry Betty as she passed on her words of wisdom to other older contestants: \"Sex, drugs and rock n' roll, just go for it.\"</p> <p>On the other end of the spectrum there was a 15-year-old, Jay Worley from Wales, who looked much younger than his age. His voice hadn't even broken yet. Yes, he was adorable \u2013 and very talented for his age \u2013 but too young to be dealing with the pressures that a circus like The X Factor puts on its contestants. Tellingly, the response of the judges was divided. Both Louis and Simon, the music business part of the panel, gave their emphatic yeses. They could obviously see the marketability of the young boy, while Cheryl \u2013 knowing how the pressures that come with the job can be overwhelming, even for an adult \u2013 said he was too young. </p> <p>Now to the best and worst of Saturday's auditions:</p> <p>The worst</p> <p>Alan Penfold \u2013 One couldn't help but feeling a bit sorry for the 43 year old pizza delivery worker. His rendition of Michael Jackson's Black or White went down like a lead balloon, even though he had the white glove and shades on and even did the rap. Thank God the judges didn't make fun of him. That would just have been too cruel.</p> <p>Terry \u2013 The smiling school caretaker who sang Dancing Queen in a Louis Armstrong rendition had obviously wandered into the wrong audition. Of course he was meant to be at Stars In Their Eyes.</p> <p>The best</p> <p>Amy Connelly \u2013 In the cynical set-ups department, they must have been rubbing their hands. As soon as Dermot O'Leary talked to her, my friend said: \"I bet she's had someone die in her family.\" Sure enough, we soon found out that her mum had passed away and she was singing for her dad who had given up his singing career to take care of his family. Cue, Cheryl shedding a few tears. Still, I couldn't help being moved by her understated version of Faith Hill's There You'll Be. Okay, I admit it - I am a softy.</p> <p>4Instinct \u2013 They got a very brief clip \u2013 and their background story didn't feature - which, disappointingly, may mean that they haven't gone through to the finals. But the brother and three sisters group from London did a brilliant rendition of Stevie Wonder's Isn't She Lovely. Effortless and beautiful. </p> <p>Many people say that they only watch the initial auditions, to see the endless parade of delusional people, but I'm personally looking forward to bootcamp. It's my favourite part of the series. This is when they have to perform without much notice or practice \u2013 sometimes in groups with people that they barely know. </p> <p>A few of the people who have made an impression so far are the 25 year old mother of five with a past history of drug addiction, the man whose wife passed away recently and the guy who wanted to prove to his birth parents that he is worthy. Will they make it through to the final studio shows? It depends on if they can handle the next phase.</p> <p>By the way, is it just me who's noticed that the carbon footprint of this programme is huge? Four separate helicopters, four separate limos and a private jet to fly them back to London. How very 1990s of them.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown cannot have expected his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/19/housingmarket.economy\">housing announcements</a> of a fortnight ago to have satisfied anyone. Identifying housing as a key issue to tackle if he wanted to restore his reputation with the electorate may have been a good political call. But he was mistaken if he thought the solution to the crisis lay within the hands of government. </p> <p>In truth, the housing crisis represents market failure far beyond the power of our government to control. Fifty years ago, when housing was last a key political battleground, fewer than 40% of us had a financial stake in our homes and most lived in homes built and run by local authorities. Then, it was genuinely possible for politicians to promise to transform our housing landscape. Now it isn't. </p> <p>Today home ownership is above 70% and housing is mostly a privatised industry. Private lending finances building and purchase. Private firms build, manage and sell property, and private citizens in their millions mortgage their lives in the hope that house-price appreciation will prove a quick route to wealth. If the flow of private capital dries up and the housing bubble bursts, there is little governments can do to salvage the situation.</p> <p>But that is not to argue that Brown couldn't have been more ambitious. In particular, he could intervene more strongly to ensure the devastating impact of the crisis on the supply of new housing is reversed. </p> <p>This year, the industry had been set to deliver some 185,000 new homes. It's a significant step on the road to the 240,000 a year necessary to meet rising housing need and make a dent in the decades-long shortfall. The collapse of the housing market means that actual output is likely to fall short of 100,000; exacerbating the already acute housing shortage. </p> <p>What's needed is an ambitious programme of investment in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/sep/17/housing.communities\">increased affordable housing</a>. This would ensure the continuing supply of new homes, prop up a housebuilding industry teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, and take advantage of now depressed land and building prices. Moreover, if Brown were willing to relax the restrictions on local authority borrowing against the value of existing housing stock, a ready source of money could be easily available.</p> <p>But increasing supply on its own will not prevent the repetition of the damage. To prevent the cycle of boom and bust in the housing market, speculation in house price appreciation <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/22/gordonbrown.economy\">must be discouraged</a>. Home ownership gives people security and a stake in the community. But we need to look again at the home ownership deal to ensure that housing returns to being an essential of life rather than a tradable commodity. We must find ways of weakening or even cutting the link between home ownership and wealth acquisition. We can't allow so much of the nation's prosperity to be bound up in the operation of the housing market. To do so exposes all our financial futures to the risk that this won't be the last large economic crisis.</p>",
  "<h2>1960s Britain</h2> <p>At roughly the same time England's football team were winning the World Cup, Michelangelo Antonioni's film Blow Up was deconstructing the world of appearances.</p> <p>The question of what we understand as real and substantial was at the heart of the 1960s avant garde. The New Wave film-makers from Europe began to mix things up in an effort to draw attention to the intrinsic artifice of cinema. Beginnings, middles and ends were jumbled, song and dance routines inserted, and the paraphernalia and mechanics of film-making revealed. All this brought into question the naturalness and reality of the film world.</p> <p>Beyond the rarefied world of the avant garde, Antonioni's film was a serious part of a process that effectively dismantled the comfy and long-standing agreements about money, power and prestige in Britain. The swinging 60s provided a framework for the redistribution of power and prestige, especially in the cultural arena. It's not surprising that, in consequence, social conservatives have consistently tried to revise the 1960s downwards.</p> <p>The 1960s was a period of enormous and irrevocable social change in Britain. The end of national service and the expansion of the university sector changed the experience of higher education across Britain. The student body became younger, more gender equal and, thanks to the new social sciences, more critical of the establishment's instruments of power.</p> <p>The convergence of these trends created a radical and popular politics based around a youth culture of hedonistic lifestyle choices. These choices expressed themselves through fashion, music, sexual liberation and recreational drug use and effectively called into question the moral superiority of the ruling class. The various political scandals, and loss of face, attaching themselves to the elite during the 1960s simply confirmed the widespread feeling, amongst the young, that a new kind of democratic reality was urgently required.</p> <h2>Love the camera, baby</h2> <p>The photographer emerged, in the course of the 1960s, as a major force in shaping the new reality and giving it visual expression. At the beginnings of the 1960s, photography for publication was still a mostly studio-based affair with statuesque models and static poses. The models were chosen from the ranks of aristocratic debutantes and gave expression to a top-down fashion system in which beauty, style and elegance were all derived from history, breeding and tradition.</p> <p>Of course this was fine for when the fashion system was based on couture and where the only market for clothes was made-to-measure. The emergence of ready-to-wear collections, exemplified by Saint Laurent's Rive Gauche in 1966, challenged the orthodoxy of the fashion system. Suddenly, fashion was about something younger and more dynamic.</p> <p>Accordingly, a new kind of photographic imagery was required. The studio was abandoned in favour of location shoots and hand-held medium format or 35mm. The Leica camera, the first of the high quality hand-held compacts had revolutionised photography. New points of view were made possible. The exaggerated diagonals of vertical perspectives distinguished these early efforts at dynamic photography during the 1920s and 30s.</p> <p>By the 1960s, the compact cameras and fast films had allowed the shoot to become a more proactive process. This involved the photographer maintaining a constant flow of encouraging talk while shooting hundreds of images. The dynamic voyeurism of the process gave the new images a sex appeal rooted in the real-life emancipation of economic and social equality.</p> <p>David Bailey, Terence Donovan and Duffy emerged as the new names of fashion photography. The street, and its models, became the backdrop against which new trends, and new faces (Twiggy and Jean Shrimpton especially), were positioned. A little later, George Best became a conduit for a lifestyle of fashion, cars and footie.</p> <h2>Image</h2> <p>The poster for Blow Up is a rough mechanically-produced piece of photolithography. It is designed to look like a screen print. The image of the model and photographer, mid-shoot, is enlarged to the limits of half-tone photomechanical reproduction. The image, reduced to a series of dots, has begun to lose definition. However, these technical limitations are used to advantage so as to communicate a sense of urgent and dynamic reality to both the protagonists and to the film event. The visible half-tone effect also positions the image amongst those associated with documentary and press photographs. So, the poster image immediately appeals to the heightened realism associated with these genres.</p> <p>The titles and credits are presented in a typographic style associated with the workaday functionalism of 1960s modernism. The typeface is a condensed sans serif of the kind normally associated with newspaper advertising, headline texts and information graphics. The text eschews all decoration in favour of emotional neutrality that, again, positions the film within the domain of non-fiction.</p> <p>This is in sharp contrast with the typographic exuberance of many film, theatre and entertainment announcements. The early history of letterpress playbills for the theatre made a virtue of the limited typographic resources available to printers. The relative shortage of letters in big sizes forced them to adopt a typographic eclecticism in their arrangements of titles and information. Again, the poster design for Blow Up signals a sharp break from the traditions of the past.</p> <p>Three versions of the poster exist, each with different coloured backgrounds. The solid red, yellow and green provide for variation when the poster is displayed, in series, on the hoardings of building sites and street corners. By using a visual rhetoric of functionalism and a graphic style derived from the exigencies of counter-cultural fly posting, the poster brings together the film space and street scene of cosmopolitan London. This poster swings.</p>",
  "<p>Forget the mumblings of Pete Doherty. When it comes to excuses for skipping gigs, you can't really argue with Franz Ferdinand's Paul Thomson. He wasn't able to take the stage at the Equinox Pilton Party last Friday, scurrying back to Scotland for ... the birth of his son.</p> <p>With Thomson disappearing up to Scotland as his wife went into labour, the Glaswegian band swapped their headlining spot with the Ting Tings. They instead performed a semi-acoustic set earlier in the day, bringing in a couple of replacement drummers.</p> <p>\"I don't know if you've heard about Paul our drummer,\" Kapranos told the Somerset crowd on Friday afternoon. \"His wife went into labour, then 20 minutes ago we heard she'd given birth to a baby boy.\"</p> <p>Franz Ferdinand drum tech Alan Johnston and former Fall drummer Nick Dewey both played on songs. The group also strummed through three stripped-down, drum-less cuts, with frontman Alex Kapranos saying, \"I feel like a singer-songwriter! ... It's good for Franz, we don't normally get to play our songs this way.\"</p> <p>The Equinox Pilton Party is an annual gig at the Glastonbury festival site, thanking local residents for their help with the summer festival. </p> <p>Kapranos also spoke to Rolling Stone this week about the band's forthcoming album. \"The album is finished but there is a little bit of mixing left,\" he said, \"a lot of which is being done by Mike Fraser who's known for doing a lot of heavier rock stuff like Aerosmith and AC/DC.\" It may be released as early as January.</p> <p>The singer also dispelled rumours of a heavily Afrobeat-influenced record. \"Over the last two years, I've avoided talking to the press because I don't really want people to know what we're up to,\" he said. \"So as a result, any comments that we've made seem to have been exaggerated. I love a lot of the Ethiopian stuff out there, but the record doesn't sound Afrobeat in the slightest.\"</p> <p>Though he described the album as \"sinister\", he also said that the band were trying to capture the \"naive energy\" and \"youthful optimism\" of listening to music as a child. </p> <p>\"You can't control your body's reaction to it - you can't help flinging yourself around the room and bouncing up and down on your mattress and literally bouncing off the wall,\" Kapranos said.</p> <p>As Paul Thomson drummer will doubtless this weekend be discovering, children can also do a whole load of crying.</p>",
  "<p>A couple of the Sundays got <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/3042291/Boris-Johnsons-island-plan-unrealistic.html\">very excited about \"Boris Island\"</a> yesterday, this being Mayor Johnson's notion of <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4794832.ece\">planting a whole new airport on a whole new land mass</a> next to the dear old Isle of Sheppey. This is where Heathrow really ought to be, you see.</p> <p>It all lends itself easily to Boris parody: \"Cripes, chaps, I've had the most wizard wheeze!\" But don't laugh too hard. He's serious, and so is <a href=\"http://www.kitmalthouse.com/\">Kit Malthouse, one of his deputies</a>, who's been looking at the idea for a while.</p> <p>He floated it in a piece for the Times last year, pointing out that <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article2925884.ece\">Paris, Hong Kong, Washington and New York</a> among others have moved their airports in recent decades. Then Johnson advocated it during the election campaign as an alternative to his party's line on a third runway at Heathrow, prompting the leader of Kent county council to say it would <a href=\"http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kol08/article/default.asp?article_id=38478\">\"never be viable or popular\"</a>.</p> <p>The leader of Dartford council, the aptly named Councillor Kite, added in June that <a href=\"http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/localheadlines/display.var.2324191.0.boris_fails_to_rule_out_north_kent_airport.php\">\"if Boris thinks an airport in the area would work then he is an idiot\"</a>.</p> <p>Is he? Heathrow Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise doesn't go that far, but is distinctly unenthused. Richard Branson, for different reasons, feels the same. Labour alleges it's a stunt to shift attention from Tory divisions over Heathrow expansion.</p> <p>In the blogosphere, the Spine is <a href=\"http://www.the-spine.com/\">visually inspired</a>, but the <a href=\"http://torytroll.blogspot.com/2008/09/kit-malthouse-to-move-heathrow-to-boris.html\">Tory Troll is scathing</a>, excavating Malthouse's <a href=\"http://business.scotsman.com/transport/Airlines-turbulence-blamed-as-Hop.2543071.jp\">unsuccessful attempt to launch a budget airline</a> in 2004.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.boriswatch.co.uk/2008/09/21/boris-airport/\">Boris Watch is more receptive</a>, saying \"the airport part looks perfectly feasible\", but then bursts the balloon with a costed critique of all the surface access and infrastructure implications.</p> <p>Malthouse and Johnson will take a lot of deterring. A detailed feasibility study will take place. \"If we can build St Paul's, the Gherkin, the Channel tunnel and all the rest, we can do this, \"Malthouse said. \"We just need a bit of courage.\"</p> <p>Vanity project or bold vision of the kind that made Britain great? Reader, you decide.</p>",
  "<p>The prominence of Saudis among the September 11 2001 plotters and in the al-Qaida leadership has put Saudi Arabia under intense international scrutiny in recent years. In response, the kingdom has reined in Islamist extremists and urged its people to desist from joining the insurgency in Iraq.</p> <p>Internationally, Saudi Arabia has started to advocate for greater religious tolerance. Last July, King Abdullah launched an <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/07/29/opinion/edsalhani.php\">interfaith conference</a> in Madrid, inviting representatives not only of various Christian denominations but also Jewish and Shinto religious leaders.</p> <p>At home, Crown Prince (now King) Abdullah launched a national dialogue in 2003, in which carefully selected members of the Saudi elite voiced opposing opinions on delicate matters, including religious extremism. In the same year a leading Saudi cleric from the Sunni establishment, Salman al-Awda, was photographed together with Hasan al-Saffar, a prominent cleric from Saudi Arabia's oppressed Shia minority.</p> <p>All this is welcome in a country which, backed by petro-wealth, aspires to leadership of the Muslim world, is guardian of Islam's two holiest sites, and each year hosts the hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca, which brings together Muslims of all branches and sects of Islam.</p> <p>However, as a <a href=\"http://hrw.org/reports/2008/saudiarabia0908/\">new report</a> by Human Rights Watch reveals, Saudi Arabia's treatment of one of its own Muslim religious minorities, the Ismailis, still leaves much to be desired. The report provides evidence of Saudi government discrimination against Ismailis in employment, education, religious practice, and in the justice system.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia's Ismailis are estimated to number up to one million, mostly living in the southwestern <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najran_Province\">Najran province</a>, a remote area which was the House of Saud's last territorial conquest, in 1934. The Ismaili community is a subset of the country's Muslim Shia minority, which represents 10 to 15% of the Saudi population. Discrimination against Ismailis is part of a pattern of discrimination against the wider Shia community.</p> <p>School textbooks teach Saudi students that adhering to the Ismaili faith constitutes the sin of \"major polytheism\", effectively declaring its adherents not to be Muslims at all, but infidels. In August 2006, Saudi Arabia's highest judge, Shaikh Salih al-Luhaidan, told an audience of hundreds that Ismailis \"outwardly appear Muslim, but inwardly, they are infidels\". A subsidiary body to the council of senior religious scholars, tasked with officially interpreting Islamic faith, ritual, and law, in April 2007 termed Ismailis \"corrupt infidels, debauched atheists\".</p> <p>In April 2000, the authorities in Najran arrested an Ismaili cleric, accusing him of sorcery. In response to a violent demonstration for the cleric's release, the governor of Najran, Prince Mishal, had hundreds of Ismailis arrested and dozens tortured and tried in secret trials in Riyadh. He then purged four hundred Ismaili public officials from the local bureaucracy.</p> <p>Since these violent events, discrimination against Ismailis in employment has continued. Where previously seven of the 35 heads of local government departments were local Ismailis, now only one remains. Almost no Ismailis work as senior security personnel or as religious teachers.</p> <p>In March 2006 a judges respectively annulled the marriage of an Ismaili man to a Sunni woman because of his lack of religious qualification. In May the same year another court barred an Ismaili lawyer from representing his Sunni client. In 1996 judge in Najran sentenced an Ismaili man, Hadi al-Mutif, to death for having \"insulted the prophet\". Last April the Saudi intelligence services detained an Ismaili Shaikh, Ahmed bin Turki al-Sab, because he petitioned the king to remove Prince Mishal. He remains in prison.</p> <p>Persistent discrimination against the Ismaili community of Saudi Arabia is just one aspect of Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record. Since September 11 the government has indicated that it wants to change Saudi Arabia's image as a closed, repressive and intolerant society. It has taken some superficial steps towards reform. But if it wants to be seen to be challenging religious extremism rather than pandering to it, the leaders in Riyadh will have to do more than convene a few international conferences on religious tolerance.</p> <p>If it wants to be taken seriously as a voice of moderation and tolerance, Saudi Arabia needs to make serious efforts to clamp down on the institutional discrimination against its own religious minorities, like the Ismailis.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/23/politics.roundupreviews\">post-Cold War</a> order in Europe is finished, with Vladimir Putin its executioner. Russia's invasion of Georgia only marked its passing. Russia has emerged out of the war as a born-again 19th-century power determined to challenge the intellectual, moral, and institutional foundations of the Post-Cold War European order. </p> <p>Today, Russia and the European Union have sharply opposing views on the sources of instability in Eurasia. If the west persists in ignoring Russia's concerns and continues to expand <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nato\"> Nato</a> in the post-Soviet space, it will merely reintroduce sphere-of-influence politics in Eurasia. But breaking with the policies of the 1990s also presents grave risks, because the EU is not, and cannot be, a traditional great power, and because the west's weakness may end up rewarding \u2013 and encouraging \u2013 Russian revanchism. </p> <p>Any rethinking of EU policy toward Russia should recognise that, while Russia will remain a regional power and global player during the next decade, it is unlikely to become a liberal democracy. The EU should also recognize that Russia has legitimate concerns about the asymmetrical impact of the Cold War's end on its security. Russia felt betrayed in its expectations that the Cold War's end would mean the demilitarisation of central and eastern Europe. While Nato enlargement did not imply any real security threats for Russia, it changed the military balance between Russia and the west, fuelling the Kremlin's revisionism. </p> <p>The contrasting nature of the political elites in Russia and Europe today is another reason for concern over the future of the relationship. Unlike the late Soviet elites, who were bureaucratic, risk-adverse, and competent when it came to international relations and security policies, the new Russian elite consists of the winners of the zero-sum games of the post-communist transition. They are highly self-confident, risk prone, and immensely wealthy, and Europe's political elites, who made their careers in practicing compromise and avoiding conflicts do not know how to deal with them. </p> <p>Indeed, whereas Russia's new assertive <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/foreignpolicy\">foreign policy</a> \u2013 a mixture of newly found strength and insecurity and of mercantilism and messianism \u2013 constitutes an existential threat for Europe, the west seems unwilling to focus on the problem of a European order. It rejects Medvedev's appeals for a new security architecture, Russia's attempt to renegotiate the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) and the OSCE's mandate and agenda on the grounds that this would constitute a retreat from the achievements of the 1990s. But how correct is this judgment? </p> <p>Today's European order emerged out of the ruins of such Cold War institutions as the CFE and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/mar/29/mainsection.guardianletters1\">OSCE</a>, and has been shaped by the EU's eastern enlargement, which was intended to help complete Europe's reunification. There was thus no immediate pressure to reinvent Europe's institutional foundation, because EU enlargement was the institutional foundation for the new European order. If you behave like us, the EU said, you will become one of us. </p> <p>But now the game has changed. The EU cannot act as guardian of the post-Cold War status quo without risking a collapse of Europe's current institutional infrastructure. It is in the EU's interest to take the initiative and to engage Russia. </p> <p>The <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu \"> EU's</a> main objective should be to preserve the distinctive character of the European order \u2013 ie, the centrality of human rights and the rule of law. It should seek to prevent the return of spheres-of-influence politics in Eurasia, rather than consolidating or expanding its own sphere of influence. Russia's neighbors \u2013 democratic and non-democratic \u2013 are Europe's natural allies in this endeavour. </p> <p>The dual nature of Russia's regime \u2013 capitalist and non-democratic, European and anti-EU \u2013 demands such a strategy. The EU should focus on the ambiguity at the heart of Russia's official doctrine of \"sovereign democracy\" and use the fact that the current Russian regime's domestic legitimacy is based, to a large extent, on the perception that it is striving to bring Russia back into European civilisation. </p> <p>True, Putin's Russia does not dream of joining the EU, but Russia's stability depends on preserving the European nature of its regime. Putin promises Russians not only restoration of the country's Great Power status, but also European living standards. Russia is ready and willing to confront Europe and the West, but it cannot afford and does not want to turn its back on Europe. </p> <p>If Russia's strategy is to erode the EU by focusing on bilateral relations with member states, the EU's priority should be to institutionalise itself as Russia's only negotiating partner. Creating institutional incentives for EU unity would help Europe overcome the asymmetrical interdependence in its relations with Russia. For example, the transformation of the OSCE into a political forum in which the EU represents its member states could be the type of institutional innovation that blocks Russia's effort to split the union. </p> <p>The EU and the United States must stop pretending that they can transform Russia, or that they can simply ignore it. But nor should the EU allow Russia to reduce it to benevolent irrelevance. </p> <p><em>Ivan Krastev is chairman of the Centre for Liberal Strategies in Sofia.</em> </p> <p>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>/<a href=\"http://www.europesworld.org\">Europe's World</a>, 2008.</p>"
