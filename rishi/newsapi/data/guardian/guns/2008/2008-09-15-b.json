  "<p>It never takes them long to proclaim their \"loyalty\". Robinho, exotic shooting star or fashion accessory, depending on one's point of view, kissed the club badge in that shameless manner before Manchester City kicked off against Chelsea, and drew attention to it again when his goal gave them the lead. A year or two from now, when the novelty has worn off, the bouncing Brazilian will be kissing another badge in another city, so gather ye rosebuds while ye may, City fans. </p> <p>As Chelsea outclassed Manchester's newly-rich other team on Saturday, thoughts turned willingly to a man, 81 years old now, who was a real City man, and is now regarded, if he is regarded at all, as a failure, and a bit of a buffoon. Malcolm Allison's mind has gone, and he spends his days in a care home. Talk about \"life's sunless hill\". It's terribly sad when you think of the vigorous man he was in his prime, and the coach he was - and, furthermore, the one he might have been.</p> <p>In drawing up the inventory of his life, it is best to get the silly stuff out of the way at once. The champagne and cigars; the boasting; the women. </p> <p>The way he used to bump up young players who were barely out of short pants. Ian Bowyer was promoted as the finest centre-forward since Tommy Lawton, and Nicky Reid the fiercest tackler since Dave Mackay. Manchester City, he told anybody who would listen back in 1968, \"would terrify Europe\". They departed the European Cup in the first round, losing to Fenerbahce, who were not then a force to be reckoned with. There's plenty of evidence to suggest that Allison was indeed a buffoon, and some people have never forgotten.</p> <p>But there was another man in that skin, the ground-breaking coach who appears in David Tossell's biography, published this week by Mainstream. It is greatly to the credit of the players whose careers Allison transformed, of whom Mike Summerbee, Colin Bell and Francis Lee are the most prominent, that they prefer to recall the questing mind rather than the loud mouth. They have kept close to him in the sad later years, along with Jim Lawton, the journalist who knew him best in his glory days, and their tales are worth hearing.</p> <p>\"If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures,\" Scott Fitzgerald wrote of Jay Gatsby, \"then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life.\" That assessment could do service for Allison, too. Having spent his teenage years as a Londoner during the second world war, and then been struck by TB, which ended his playing career, he was aware of life's fragility. Maybe the excessive behaviour was a reaction to those deprivations. </p> <p>The team he shaped with Joe Mercer at Maine Road knew no deprivation where entertainment was concerned. All those discussions he enjoyed with Dave Sexton and others in their days at West Ham brought forth the ripest fruit in the late 60s when City won the Championship, the FA Cup, the League Cup and the European Cup Winners' Cup in three glorious seasons. Then, sadly, he fell out with Mercer, and the superb coach, entrusted with the duties of manager, was undermined by a recklessness that Mercer had done so much to constrain.</p> <p>What a coach he might have made for England. If, at the height of his reputation, in the summer of 1970, he had succeeded Sir Alf Ramsey as the national manager, how different things might have been in the next decade. There's no way of knowing, of course, but Allison would surely have brought more out of some gifted players than Ramsey did, or the fear-haunted Don Revie, who took over in 1974. Nobody ever said of Allison's players, as Gunther Netzer complained of Ramsey's England hackers in 1972: \"Every member of the England team tried to autograph my leg.\"</p> <p>He wrote a book, Soccer for Thinkers, which rather gave the game away. By and large people in English football do not like to think, and the national side is significantly poorer for it. Yet Allison had his triumphs, notably his mentoring of the young Bobby Moore, who led England to their greatest triumph in 1966, the year Allison was beginning his great work at Manchester City.</p> <p>So cheer on the modern, cheque-waving Blues all you like. Like Dusty Springfield, I'd rather see the world the way it used to be. \"A little bit of freedom is all we lack. Catch me if you can, I'm going back.\"</p>",
  "<p>It seems Brazilian favela cinema is in vogue again. Not since the release of City of God and Carandiru just over five years ago have this many favela films been promoted internationally. </p> <p>Following hot on the heels of the recent Elite Squad and City of Men is acclaimed director Walter Salles's Linha de Passe, which follows the lives of four brothers and the choices they face growing up in a dead-end S\u00e3o Paulo neighbourhood. But just how realistic are these films' portrayal of life in the notorious Brazilian slums? Is it all gun-toting teenagers on glamorous hill-side backdrops? </p> <h2>Casting</h2> <p>Since City of God there has been an increasing trend in Brazilian films to take a neorealist approach to casting. The use of local, untrained and unknown actors gave the film greater authenticity, although in 2003 there was a case of life imitating art when City of God actor Rubens Sabino was arrested for attempted theft. City of Men follows in its footsteps by using many of the same actors, while Linha de Passe and Elite Squad employ a mix of experienced and unknown actors. </p> <h2>Location</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337638086\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/09/15/cityofgod_beach220.jpg\" alt=\"City of God\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Film with a view ... City of God</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unlike the other films, Linha de Passe is set in S\u00e3o Paulo: there are no bright lights, beaches and picturesque views here. Indeed, S\u00e3o Paulo is portrayed as a vast, sprawling and decidedly grim concrete jungle. And it rains all the time. A slight exaggeration perhaps, but not altogether inaccurate as anyone who has spent time in the city can testify. The setting is incredibly downbeat, in stark contrast to the chaos and sunshine that pervades the Rio favelas in City of God, City of Men and Elite Squad \u2013 although all these films were shot in authentic locations. </p> <h2>Fathers</h2> <p>The theme that unites almost all the favela films is the absence of fathers. In fact, men get a very bad press in all four films. If they're not gunning down a rival gang member, then they're shacking up with anyone who isn't their wife. In Linha de Passe, the four brothers are brought up by their mother; the youngest, Reginaldo, is obsessed with tracking down his missing father, gunwhile the other three attempt to fill the gap with varying degrees of success. City of Men follows fatherless friends Wallace and Ace: one tries to track down his missing dad while the other attempts to accept the responsibilities of fatherhood by bringing up his own child. None of the characters turn to crime. But they are all ultimately the lucky ones. Research shows that most youngsters sucked into a life of crime are from broken families where in most cases the father is either an absent or abusive figure. </p> <h2>Crime</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337638140\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/09/15/cityofgod_linha.jpg\" alt=\"Stills from City of God and Linha de Passe\" width=\"220\" height=\"241\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two perspectives on favela life ... guns in City of God and football in Linha de Passe</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> <br>Which brings us to crime. It's as if no Brazilian film is complete without the necessary quota of flip-flop wearing baby-faced gangsters. That's not an entirely unfair portrayal as Brazil still lays claim to the fourth highest murder rate among the world's larger countries. Yet if City of God were to be believed, you'd have thought that everyone in the favelas was born with a gun in their hand. The film received mixed reviews from the inhabitants of the neighbourhood it portrayed for apparently showing a community living in a never-ending bloodbath. City of Men and Elite Squad give a slightly more balanced view of the gang turf wars and the way in which violence is intertwined with ordinary lives. Perhaps Linha de Passe's greatest triumph is to focus on the lives of four ordinary boys who live surrounded by the temptations of crime but, with the exception of older brother Denis, manage to avoid it. </p> <h2>Employment</h2> <p> <br>If you watch City of God, you would be forgiven for thinking that the only way of making a living in a favela is picking up a grenade and launching it at anyone not in your gang. In fact the vast majority of those living in favelas are law abiding citizens with regular jobs. Both City of Men and Linha de Passe's principal characters hold down an array of jobs from security guard to petrol pump attendant. All a far cry from the gangsters that occupy the majority of screen time in City of God and Elite Squad. </p> <h2>Women</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337638213\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/09/15/Linha-de-Passe-women220.jpg\" alt=\"Linha de Passe\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mother superior ... Linha de Passe</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> <br>All four films centre around men. The only women who feature are either hardened housewives or gangsters' molls. Their role in the community is often ignored and we are left with a sense of a very male-orientated society. This is certainly true when it comes to the drug traffickers, but less so in terms of women's overall involvement in community life. Brazilian women are still waiting for a favela film that depicts them accurately. </p> <h2>Religion</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337638214\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/09/15/Linha-de-Passe-pray220.jpg\" alt=\"Linha de Passe\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On a wing and a prayer ... Linha de Passe</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> <br>The religion that features primarily in these films is evangelical Christianity, most notably in the character of Dario in Linha de Passe, who is attempting to use the church to escape his dark past. Brazil, with a population of about 185 million, is still the world's largest Catholic country, but there has been major growth in the evangelical movement in the country over the past 20 years, especially in poorer areas, and around 15% of churchgoers now worship in evangelical churches. </p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p> <br>The stylised violence is perhaps a little exaggerated but by using a mixture of unknown actors and real locations, this most recent wave of Brazilian films give perhaps the most realistic view of favela life yet. For the best and most authentic portrayal of favelas, however, watch the TV series of City of Men.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337667263\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1797949179_gdn-arv-080915-es-levene-venice-02-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>When architects are asked to imagine futuristic buildings, they tend to come up with colourful sci-fi blobs, big swirling objects and intense videos set to monotonous electronic music. And sure enough, this is what is being served up this week at the 2008 Venice Biennale, in response to director Aaron Betsky's appeal for new notions of what friendly, provocative, and even sensuous buildings could be.</p> <p>The result is an enjoyable and spirited if often uncertain exhibition. The Arsenale, the magnificent shipyard where the warships of the Venetian navy were made and launched centuries ago, is full of all sorts of fascinating exotica - but quite what it all adds up to, I'm not so sure. Having got past some gigantic video screens bombarding the eye with abstract forms, visitors are confronted with acres of blob-like futuristic furniture, hanging from the walls and somehow morphing - in the mind's eye - into architecture. The first of these is the work of young New York-based architects Hani Rashid and Lise Anne Couture; it is fashionable and well-realised, but very much the stuff of fine art shows rather than architecture. This sets the tone of what is to come.</p> <p>The next voluminous gallery houses Astroballon 1969 Revisited Feedback Space. This sounds like a track by prog-rockers Soft Machine, and it proves to be a reworking of a would-be mind-expanding installation from the late 1960s. The original, and the revision, are by Coop Himmelb(l)au, a firm of Viennese architects that has clearly taken a very big trip indeed. Once the darlings of the European pop avant garde, they have now made a name for themselves as the architects of BMW Welt, Munich, the architectural apotheosis of contemporary corporate culture. The centrepiece of their exhibit is a kind of astrodome you walk into, to experience something mind-expandingly psychedelic. Unfortunately, it wasn't working when I tried my luck, so I moved on to gawp, quite happily, at some more big blobby furniture-into-architecture things by UN Studio and Zaha Hadid; and then a timber tower by Frank Gehry, being constructed during the course of the exhibition. It's happily meaningless, Gehry's contemporary Tower of Babel. </p> <p>These are all fun, but it's hard not to think of them as projects simply dashed off by big, talented architectural firms busy with major projects around the world, without the time to create something radically different or conceptually new. The biennale should be a chance for architects to let rip, free from the restraints of clients' budgets, planning restrictions, politics and bureaucracy. </p> <p>When I stumbled across yet another neo-60s installation, this one featuring naked, beautiful people playing neo-hippy music in the manner of the Hair musical, I began to yearn for some proper architecture. But, before I left the Arsenale show (the naked neo-hippies were, I have to say, the limit of what I could take), my eye was caught by a colourful display by American architect Greg Lynn. </p> <p>Lynn has chosen to morph children's toys into big, blobby pieces of comic furniture. It looked familiar. And I knew where I'd seen it before - the children's TV programme In the Night Garden. Designed to lull small children to sleep, the BBC's gently surreal programme is set in a land of odd plinkety-plonk music, colourful blobs, big swirling things and houses that, for the most part, visually echo cartoonish pop designs from the 1960s. I half expected Makka Pakka and the Pontipines (don't ask) to pop out at any moment. </p> <p>This unintentional childhood theme pervades much of the rest of the Arsenale. A room curated by Chilean architects is awash with tiny toy houses mounted on tall sticks. Perhaps architecture is too serious too much of the time; a bit of innocent fun, a trip back to our collective childhoods, might be no bad thing. But is this really the message Betsky is trying to get across?</p> <p>As if to make sure visitors understand that architecture is also a serious, adult affair, one room in the middle of this blobby playpen has been given over, for no recognisable reason, to proposals to remodel Rome. These have been made over the centuries by figures including Pope Julius II and the mighty architects Aldo Rossi, James Stirling, Michael Graves and L\u00e9on Krier. But since all these were schemes, never more than the stuff of dreams (except the Pope's), perhaps the room is of a piece with the rest of the show.</p> <p>Outside the grand old naval buildings, in a part of the Arsenale given over until just a few weeks ago to brambles and nettles, the landscape architects Gustafson Porter have planted an intriguing garden of sweet-smelling herbs and voluptuous vegetables, shaded by billowing white sails held aloft by white balloons. In the morning, dew holds the sails close to a rolling lawn; as the sun rises, the dew evaporates and the sails rise to form artificial clouds above the Arsenale. This is enchanting, and again very much, albeit unintentionally, in the spirit of In the Night Garden.</p> <p>The second part of the biennale, held in the national pavilions dotted through the city's giardini a few minutes' walk from the Arsenale, begins to offer some real, adult answers to the question of how we can make warm and lovable buildings for people of all classes, creeds and incomes. The US pavilion takes the theme the most seriously, with displays of radical designs for $20,000 homes executed in some of America's poorest states by such commendable US practices as the Rural Studio. These designs come as a welcome reality check. </p> <p>Curiously, one photograph of a real and powerful building by the Rural Studio proves to be unintentionally surreal. This beautiful, shelter-like construction is a dog pound built in one of the poorest areas of Alabama, one of the poorest states in the union. It stands opposite a grim state penitentiary. But while the jail is crammed, the pound is empty. The story is that there are many packs of feral, formerly domesticated dogs in rural Alabama, abandoned by poor and itinerant people. So there was a need for a dog pound. But it is empty because a local judge wants dogs held there to be shot after a short spell in their handsome cages, while US animal rescue groups oppose such trigger-happy ways. So the pound stays empty while the feral packs keep on roaming.</p> <p>This is a story worth dwelling on. It shows how, with the best will in the world, it is often very hard for architects to design and nurture truly publicly spirited projects. For all the help they get from officialdom, they might as well just dream and play. </p> <p>Throughout the national pavilions, however, there are signs that architects around the world are trying hard to address the gist of Betsky's big question: how do we create a new and truly humane architecture? The British pavilion shows some decent new housing, notably by Tony Fretton, a serious-minded soul incapable of blobbery. The Japanese site is given over to walls of exquisite pencil drawings, drawn directly on to the wall by a dozen architectural students over 20 days, depicting a beautiful garden in which houses appear to grow with the plants. </p> <p>The overall design, by the young Tokyo architect Junya Ishigami, is strikingly beautiful. \"The buildings and towns shown here,\" Ishigami tells me, \"include everything from actual projects to studies for works-in-progress to imaginary exercises. I hope some new vision might come into clearer focus by laying out these different realities.\" Here, then, is a dreamlike architecture that could be made real - a gentle and rather beautiful vision of buildings growing like plants, as appealing to adults as to children. </p> <p>What makes the Venice Biennale special is, of course, Venice itself. Here is a city that, every two years, invites today's architects to push their dreams somewhere new. This year, too many of the big players are playing too hard with pop revivalism - blobs, swirls, funny shapes and wacky colours - as if releasing their inner child. But, somewhere between Ishigami's Plants and Architecture show and the work of the altruistic Rural Studio in the US, it is just possible to see a warm new architecture slowly emerging from a jumble of half-realised, half-remembered dreams. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The <strong>Venice Biennale </strong>runs until November 23.

  "<p>BASF, the world's biggest chemicals group, is expected to cut hundreds of jobs after making an agreed \u20ac3.8bn (\u00a33bn) offer yesterday to buy the ailing Swiss speciality chemicals company Ciba.</p> <p>The German group repeatedly made plain it would accelerate the restructuring process under way at Ciba, which is cutting 2,500 jobs itself by the end of 2009. Ciba lost a net Sfr569m (\u00a3281m) in the first half on rising raw materials prices, currency fluctuations and production problems.</p> <p>J\u00fcrgen Hambrecht, BASF chief executive, refused to detail expected synergies from the all-cash deal which, at Sfr50 a share for Ciba, represents a premium of 32% to Friday's close.</p> <p>But DKIB analysts, while welcoming the latest sign of consolidation in the industry, questioned the \"not particularly cheap\" price BASF is paying for what they said were \"relatively unattractive\" businesses at this stage of the economic cycle.</p> <p>Hambrecht insisted that the deal met BASF's acquisition criteria. \"We will grow profitably in accordance with our clear and successful strategy,\" he said. \"We expect that it will make a positive contribution to earnings per share in the second year.\"</p> <p>The deal, embracing debt and pension obligations, will add operations in plastics, coatings, water treatment and paper chemicals to BASF's portfolio. The German group, which paid \u20ac3.8bn for US catalyst maker Engelhard two years ago, made \u20ac7.6bn pre-tax profit on sales of \u20ac60bn last year.</p> <p>Ciba employs 13,000 and made \u20ac336m on sales of \u20ac4bn in 2007. Its chairman, Armin Meyer, under sustained fire for the company's problems, said: \"Against the background of challenging conditions within our industry this is a transaction which combines a fair price with an industrially compelling solution for Ciba.\"</p> <p>Hambrecht said further restructuring, concentrated in paper chemicals, and improved operational performance were a prerequisite for profitable growth. But BASF officials refused to discuss the possibility of job cuts.</p>",
  "<h2>Wanted: a Cern for social scientists</h2> <p>Ministers and civil servants may not listen to physicists but at least in recent years they have given them generous support for doing what they do best, such as playing with Large Hadron Colliders under the Alps.</p> <p>But if what you do best is study society or the economy, then the gulf between Whitehall and academe is serious and, tomorrow, a report from the British Academy with the rather aggressive title Punching Our Weight will attempt some serious matchmaking.</p> <p>No UK government has talked more about basing policies on solid research evidence than New Labour. Back in 1997, academics all over the country nursed the hope that at last they would be listened to, but it is often hard to detect the impact that social scientists or humanities academics have actually had on what ministers are doing.</p> <p>However, it's impossible to dismiss the report's author, Sir Alan Wilson, who has worked at the top level in Whitehall as well as doing groundbreaking research in urban modelling. (Oh, and running one of the country's biggest universities.)</p> <p>He argues for a Cern for social scientists - large numbers of researchers, with access to huge databases, cooperating to solve policy problems. \"I'm very taken with the Large Hadron Collider. I would like to see research into public policy on the same scale,\" he says.</p> <p>The scale of the problems are just as big - globalisation, the impact of climate change, social mobility, pensions and care for the elderly. \"It's important to have meetings about how to tackle all this, but it is substantial projects on big strategic questions of public policy that make the real difference.\"</p> <p>Both sides need to change, his report will tell the minister for science and innovation, Ian Pearson. Government needs to commission more long-term research and universities have to invest more in research that has a bearing on public policy-making. Where is the UK's equivalent of Harvard's Kennedy school of government, let alone a Cern for social scientists?<br><strong>Donald MacLeod</strong></p> <h2>Where teacher gives you an Apple</h2> <p>When Bill Rankin, an English professor at Abilene Christian University in Texas, asks his students for their thoughts on last night's reading, they don't put their hands up. They reach for their iPhones and begin typing. </p> <p>It's not the height of rudeness. In his class - and every undergrad class at the university - students are expected to use their iPhones. Their answers appear on a screen at the front of the room, and form the basis for discussion. </p> <p>The university gave all its 1,000 or so incoming students the shiny new Apple device.\"One of the things we were thinking about is: how do you break down the walls of the classroom?\" says Rankin. Students use the phones to access schedules, contact teachers, even get information on after-class events in town. Lecturers can do instant polls, and get immediate feedback. </p> <p>\"It's about student engagement - involving students who wouldn't usually talk in class - and the portability and immediacy of the device,\" says Rankin. He's convinced it can change teaching for the better.</p> <p>But not everyone agrees that technology enhances learning. Robert Summers, who has taught law at Cornell University for 40 years, recently banned laptops from his lectures to improve the \"active intellectual experience\". </p> <p>Won't students simply be distracted by their shiny new phones? </p> <p>\"If it gets a little dull, I get it out under the desk and check Facebook,\" admits iPhone fan Nina Martinez, a student at NYU.</p> <p>Christopher Dede, a professor in learning technologies at Harvard, thinks the phones are not the problem. \"If the class is boring, students will find ways of being distracted. If they have a phone, they'll play with the phone. If they have a laptop, they'll play with the laptop. If they don't have either, they'll stare at a crack in the ceiling.\"<br><strong>Ravi Somaiya</strong></p> <h2>What we learned this week</h2> <p>Why are geologists so much happier than fine art and drama students? It's not clear that anyone has researched this question thrown up by last week's National Student Survey (see theguardian.com/education/students) but it's beginning to worry institutions with a lot of art and drama students - the University of the Arts London, for instance - that find themselves at the bottom of the student-satisfaction table yet again. </p> <p>Is it the field trips to study Caribbean beach formation? Or do art students feel they have to suffer for their art? Least happy are students on cinematics and photography courses (67% satisfied) while would-be journalists and social workers also tend to be disgruntled - but then, you would rather expect that. </p> <p>The survey numbers are reasonably substantial, so it's not just a few malcontents or happy rock-bashers. Of the 809 geology students at 16 universities, more than 95% were satisfied. The 2,000 pharmacy students also seemed happy with their lot in contrast to more than 2,600 cineasts and snappers, and 2,700 fine art aficionados. Physical geography and environmental science also seem to be hotbeds of contentment, which would tend to back up the field-trip thesis, but then so are physics and astronomy, classics, history and archaeology.</p> <p>More likely is the hope of finding a job - the survey is taken in the final year, when it's beginning to dawn on art and drama students that galleries/theatre producers/film directors have, oddly, failed to discover them. Geologists, on the other hand, are wondering whether their consciences will allow them to accept huge salaries to find oil in Alaska (well, polar bears are overrated) or somewhere to bury nuclear waste. </p> <p>Meanwhile, it was difficult to tell who was least happy about the Sats fiasco - the \"sacked\" markers ETS Europe, or the National Assessment Authority, in charge of the operation. At a select committee last week, the company got its own back by blaming late changes by the NAA. A furious NAA retorted that the changes helped to reduce the workload.<br><strong>Donald MacLeod</strong></p>",
  "<p>The Paralympics close tomorrow, marking the end of an inspirational summer of sport from China that has fired up enthusiasm for London 2012.</p> <p>Here, mini would-be Olympians snapped up trainers and water bottles in preparation for this term and the jog around the field at the start of the PE lesson has suddenly got competitive.</p> <p>There is no statutory obligation for schools to teach sport, but the government expects all maintained schools in England to provide two hours of \"high quality\" PE and school sport for every child, every week.</p> <p>This is being increased to five hours of exercise for all five- to 16-year-olds by 2012 - with the three extra hours provided by clubs and facilities outside school. All 16- to 19-year-olds will be offered three hours of out-of-school sport a week.</p> <p>Governors have a responsibility for the health and wellbeing of students under one of the five outcomes of the Every Child Matters strategy. A key strand of this is ensuring that children get enough exercise through sport. The benefits include learning about teamwork, coaching, leadership through sport, and even supporting and encouraging peers by being a spectator.</p> <p>It is important that governors show their support for school sport. They should be aware of opportunities for sporting links and sponsorship with other organisations, as part of the school's links with the wider community. </p> <p>If governors are concerned that the teaching of sport is not adequate, they can suggest the headteacher agrees to a sports audit, involving pupils and staff, based on the government's PE, School Sport and Club Links strategy (PESSCL).</p> <p>This framework gives step-by-step guidance on how to measure the success of sport in school and how to improve it.</p> <p>For school sport to flourish and form successful partnerships with other providers, coordinators and link teachers need to have off-timetable periods to organise it. Governors should check that PE staff are getting this opportunity.</p> <p>Some governors want to take on a more practical role and could help to coach a sport - providing the head approves and there are no conflicts of interest. It helps governors to get to know the students and gives first-hand experience of the resources and challenges faced by the PE staff. Remember, though, if you volunteer, you are not there to make judgments on teaching performance.

  "<p>It's not often that a linguistics book gets a review in Take a Break magazine, \"the world's No 1 true-life weekly\". But you should never underestimate the power of a moral panic. Back in 2003, a school teacher posted an exam essay he had been marking on the internet - because it had been written in txt spk.Within days, it had been picked up by the media and appeared in several tabloids. Here was conclusive proof that the kidz really had taken over the asylum. Academic standards were in freefall; no one could punctuate any more; no one could spell any more; the English language was screwed; the country was screwed; we were all screwed.</p> <p>No matter that the essay was soon revealed to be a hoax. The myth was much more appealing than the truth and it gave otherwise sane people, such as Lynne Truss and John Humphrys, carte blanche to cash in on everyone's fears by writing knee-jerk defences of standard English in the face of threats that only ever existed in their imaginations. In fact, texting was such a new phenomenon that there was no research-based evidence to prove anything very much.</p> <p>So David Crystal, the UK's leading linguistic academic, decided to go looking for some facts and earlier this year Txting: the gr8 db8, his rather more considered contribution to the argument, was published.</p> <p>\"Almost every basic principle that people hold about texting turns out to be misconceived. Misspelling isn't universal: analysis shows that only 10% of words used in texts are misspelt. Nor are most texts sent by kids: 80% are sent by businesses and adults. Likewise, there is no evidence that texting teaches people to spell badly: rather, research shows that those kids who text frequently are more likely to be the most literate and the best spellers, because you have to know how to manipulate language,\" he says, finally pausing for breath in his trademark machine-gun, motormouth, Liverpudlian speech. </p> <p>\"If you can't spell a word, then you don't really know whether it's cool to misspell it. Kids have a very precise idea of context - none of those I have spoken to would dream of using text abbreviations in their exams - they know they would be marked down for it.\"</p> <p>Changing opinions is hard work, but Crystal is hopeful of converting the linguistic reactionaries. \"I've had several reviews that started, 'I picked up this book expecting to hate it, but to my surprise...',\" he says, \"which is something of a rarity. Academics don't normally manage to alter people's way of thinking through their strength of argument.\" </p> <p>But whether he can is almost beside the point. What matters to him is that he's laid down another marker in his lifelong campaign to promote the English language as a living, egalitarian medium, rather than as a relic to be preserved and revered.</p> <p>\"There is some evidence to suggest we're becoming less obsessed with correct spelling,\" he continues, \"but it's far from a texting phenomenon. If you take a look at the Bullock Report of 1975, you can see there were huge concerns even then that children were no longer being taught to spell and write properly. </p> <p><strong>Fear of technology</strong></p> <p>\"The reality is that people have always had a tremendous fear about the impact of new technology on language. When the printing press was first invented, people thought it was an instrument of the devil that would spawn unauthorised versions of the bible. The telephone created fears of a breakdown in family life, with people no longer speaking directly to one another. And radio and television raised concerns about brain-washing. Text messaging is just the most recent focus of people's anxiety; what people are really worried about is a new generation gaining control of what they see as their language.\"</p> <p>At its most basic, language is an expression of identity. How we speak is central to who we think we are and where we think we belong. And that goes a long way to explaining how language has held such a visceral grip on Crystal throughout his life.</p> <p>Crystal says he became aware of differences in language while growing up in Anglesey and listening to Welsh being spoken. \"Neither my mother nor I spoke Welsh,\" he says, \"but my uncle Joe did, and I can remember thinking, 'How come I can understand what she is saying and I can't understand what he is saying?'\" You can't help thinking that questionmarks over his own identity were just as influential. For Crystal didn't get to know his father until he was almost 50. </p> <p>Crystal was born in Lisburn, after his mother was evacuated to Northern Ireland in 1941, but his parents separated before he was a year old, and his mother took him back to Holyhead and brought him up on her own. She never came to terms with the separation: she did not allow her husband's name to be mentioned and she cut him out of all her photographs. For Crystal, then, his father existed as a shadow.</p> <p>When he was 10, the first outlines of his father started to emerge when Crystal opened an official letter addressed to his mother. </p> <p>\"It was the decree nisi,\" he says, \"and I learned my father's name was Samuel Crystal, and that he was still alive. Up till then, I had always thought he was dead and had imagined a life for him as a war hero.\" But that was as far as his knowledge went, as his mother remained silent. </p> <p>Then, some time in the mid-1960s, he met an academic at a linguistics seminar at Leeds University who told him he knew a doctor called Samuel Crystal and asked if he could be related. Crystal was non-commital, though he suspected it had to be his father. \"Later on, when I was alone, I went to his house and stood outside. Somehow I couldn't bring myself to knock on his door; but at least I knew where he now lived.\"</p> <p>Several years later, Crystal's first son, Timmy, was born with a cleft palate and the doctors wanted to know if there was any family history of the condition. He asked his then wife to write to his father on his behalf, as he couldn't bring himself to do it. \"He wrote back to say no there wasn't any family history, it was nice to hear from us, and he would be in touch,\" Crystal says. \"But he wasn't, and I had been programmed to do nothing and accept it.\" </p> <p>The next contact came about 15 years later, after one of his colleagues at Reading University told him he knew a Samuel Crystal who lived in London. Crystal asked him to hand his father a letter, and two days later the phone rang. \"We talked for a bit,\" he says. \"I learned he had a new wife, and we agreed that we should meet. But again, he never phoned. So this time I called him back and spoke to his wife, who told me that he was ill and had been taken to hospital, and that she had been against the idea of us meeting because she was sure I would be a bastard and blame him for everything.\"</p> <p><strong>Same father</strong></p> <p>That was that for another 10 years, until he was phoned by a man saying his name was Michael, they both had entries in Who's Who, and he thought they had the same father. </p> <p>\"He was my half-brother,\" Crystal says. \"When I'd last spoken to my father, he had been so interested in me that I had forgotten to ask him anything about him. When I had lunch with Michael, I found myself accreting new relatives at the rate of one about every 10 minutes.\" </p> <p>Through Michael, Crystal has finally got to colour in his picture of his father. It's a process that's taken the best part of half a century and has led him to some curious discoveries, not the least the realisation that, though he was born and remains a practising Catholic, he is half-Jewish. </p> <p>But Crystal seems unruffled. He is what he is and it took as long as was needed. Simple as that. And maybe it is. But you can't ignore the tenacity with which Crystal has pursued his own identity, a persistence mirrored in his approach to language. </p> <p>There was a time he may have fancied a career as a musician - he was in a successful Liverpool band called the Zodiacs - but once he had his A-levels and a place at University College London, he only ever had his eye on academia. Other students called him \"prof\", and after graduating he started work immediately as a researcher for his mentor, Randolph Quirk.</p> <p><strong>Thatcher cuts</strong></p> <p>A couple of years later, he was offered a job at Bangor University. \"\"Returning to north Wales was just one of those bizarre coincidences,\" he smiles. \"I hadn't planned on going back. It was just that Bangor was one of the first universities to have a dedicated linguistics department.\" Along with most of the department, he was later poached by Reading University, and remained there for 20 years, until he decided he could bear it no more. \"It was the time of the Thatcher cuts in higher education and we were getting more and more squeezed,\" he explains. \"I ended up wasting hours queueing for the photocopier.\" </p> <p>So he quit academia, moved back to Anglesey, set himself up as an independent language consultant - \"no one else had done it but I thought I'd give it a try\" - and waited for the phone to ring. By the end of the first year his wife had to put a note by the phone reminding him to say no to work occasionally.</p> <p>It's advice he appears to have ignored. His output over the past 20 years has been prolific. He has authored or co-authored more than 100 books - he knocked off his best-selling 600-page epic The Story of English in less than three months - he's edited several encyclopaedias, renovated a convent and turned it into a community arts centre, built an extension on to his extension to house a whole cottage industry of fellow researchers, developed databases for internet search engines, made countless radio and TV appearances, and launched dozens of lesser projects I'm already too tired to mention.</p> <p>And Crystal has no intention of letting up. \"I love working,\" he says. \"And, much as people like Lynne Truss may not like it, language is always changing. So there will always be something to write about.\"</p> <h2>Curriculum vitae</h2> <p><strong>Age </strong>67</p> <p><strong>Job </strong>Honorary professor of linguistics, University of Wales, Bangor</p> <p><strong>Books</strong> Txtng: the gr8db8; The Story of English; The Fight for English; Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Language</p> <p><strong>Likes</strong> film.

  "<p>This is an article my father would rather I didn't write. \"You want to watch it, you know,\" he has said to me, more than once. \"If you're not careful, you'll get a brick through your window.\" In the working-class area of Peterborough where my father grew up during the 20s and 30s, it probably wasn't wise to mention that you had Romany blood, however distant. </p> <p>At that time, my father and his family had no idea about the horrors about to be perpetrated against the Roma and Sinti in Europe under Nazi occupation but prejudice they understood, all right, even from within their own family. \"My mother used to hit me when I was bad,\" one of my aunts once told me, \"and she always said to me, 'I'll beat the Gypsy out of you, my girl.'\" When my father first told me about our Romany ancestry, he asked me not to mention it to neighbours or friends at school - a suggestion no doubt at the root of my abiding fascination with what is, after all, only a small part of our family history. Even so, he finds it hard to accept that had Germany successfully invaded Britain during the second world war, he and his family would have qualified for shipping to the gas chambers alongside British Jews. </p> <p>This would have happened despite our family having been settled since the turn of the 20th century. In common with many English Romanichal Gypsies, my ancestors found the traditional ways of earning a living - horse-dealing, harvesting - were coming to an end with increasing agricultural mechanisation. At that time, an astute social commentator could have been forgiven for predicting that English Romany culture would rapidly become assimilated into that of the majority population. \"We're just going to fade away,\" a Romanichal man told me at the Barnet Horse Fair, as recently as 1993. \"It's all going to go.\"</p> <p>Instead, the opposite seems to be happening. In Europe, Roma and Sinti people now number close to 10 million and are the fastest growing ethnic minority. In this country, there is an increasingly vocal and visible class of Romany and Traveller activists and intellectuals, including the poet David Morley, journalist Jake Bowers, storyteller and playwright Richard Rai O'Neill and artists such as Delaine and Damien Le Bas, who appeared in the first ever Roma art pavilion at last year's Venice Biennale. Across Europe there are now Roma newspapers, radio and television stations and a Roma MEP, L\u00edvia J\u00e1r\u00f3ka, of the Hungarian centre-right party Fidesz.</p> <p>Despite this, and the growing politicisation and cross-cultural awareness of many disparate Roma groups, there is no denying that the majority of this huge and various group live in the most appalling economic conditions, with an estimated 84% across Europe below the recognised poverty line. In this country, the lack of site provision for Travellers has forced many into conflict with local planning regulations and straight on to the pages of the tabloids. </p> <p>The site provision crisis in this country can be traced directly back to 1994, when John Major's government abolished the Caravan Sites Act, which obliged local authorities to provide adequate sites for Travellers. At the time, Romanies and Travellers were urged to buy their own land to settle. Many duly did, only to find themselves refused planning permission to park their trailers on land that they legally owned. One Traveller who has fallen foul of planning regulations in this way is Bernadette Reilly from Brentwood. She can remember very clearly what it was like when the family was forced to camp by the side of the road. \"We didn't have what most people would call a normal life, although it was normal for us,\" she says wearily. \"We had no water, no sanitation, no electricity, and no healthcare other than going to A&amp;E.\" In 2007, she and her family were granted five-year permission to live in their trailers on land they had bought between the villages of Mountnessing and Ingatestone. \"At least we have water and flushing toilets now, if not electricity or a land line,\" she says. </p> <p>Brentwood council - backed by the local Conservative MP, Eric Pickles, who lives near the site - went to court and overturned the decision. But the Travellers were later granted permission to appeal and the judge told the council to stop wasting public money fighting the case. Pickles did not respond to my requests for an interview, but directed me to his website statement opposing the site on the basis that it falls within the metropolitan greenbelt.</p> <p>Professor Thomas Acton of the University of Greenwich is this country's first professor of Romany studies and an internationally renowned expert on Romany culture and history. He also spends a great deal of his own time helping and advising Travellers such as Reilly. \"Eric Pickles has responsibility for Gypsy sites in the shadow cabinet, yet he has denied the existence of a long-established Traveller community in Brentwood and urged the local council to ignore their obligations until a Conservative government abolishes them.\"</p> <p>Reilly and her family would like to enjoy their temporary reprieve from eviction, but the threat of being moved on in the future still weighs heavily upon them. As part of the planning process, they were allowed to see some of the bile-filled letters written against their application by local residents. \"The children have local friends and go to clubs now, but I won't let them out wandering around town on their own, it's too dangerous for them, \" she says. What is it like to have the MP on your doorstep campaigning against you? Reilly's reply is blunt. \"We live in fear all the time.\" Opponents of Traveller sites are quick to criticise Travellers for being wary or hostile to outsiders without any understanding of the siege mentality the constant sense of threat engenders. After viewing the hate mail the planning office received, Reilly wrote a poem entitled I Am a Traveller: </p> <p>\"I bring up my children the best way I know how.<br>They are all I own, they are all I have now.<br>They have manners, they are kind, they are my delight.<br>But that's not what you shout as you drive by at night.\"</p> <p>The climate of fear among Travellers in rural areas will not have been eased by the Red, White and Blue rally held last month by the British National party in Denby, Derbyshire. One of the guests invited to speak at the event was Petra Edelmannov\u00e1, chairwoman of the Czech National party, a tiny fringe movement from the Czech Republic notable mainly for its overt antagonism towards the Roma. Edelmannov\u00e1 has written a pamphlet entitled The Final Solution to the Gypsy Issue in the Czech Lands, which advocates repatriating the Czech Republic's Roma population to India. In the event, Edelmannov\u00e1 did not show up for the rally, but she seems a strange choice of speaker for what the BNP insists was a weekend of family fun with bouncy castles. </p> <p>When I raised this with BNP deputy leader Simon Darby he conceded that the phrase \"final solution\" was \"not exactly the best title for a document\" but added, \"there is a Gypsy problem there. There is a problem in this country as well.\" What did he regard as the nature of our Gypsy problem? \"Some of the Travelling community have been here for a very long time. They keep themselves to themselves and sort out their own problems within their own communities. They have the same morals as me. I don't have a problem with them.\" He identifies the \"problem\" as being foreign Roma who have immigrated into the UK since European enlargement, along with an undefined group of what he calls \"homegrown pseudo-Gypsies\". </p> <p>This artificial distinction between different groups of Romanies and Travellers in order to justify discrimination was something I also encountered when I spent time in the Czech Republic as a writer in residence at the Masaryk University in Brno. I was told that the problem with the Roma was not \"our Gypsies\" but the Slovak Gypsies, many of whom moved to the Czech lands to fill labour shortages in factories after the second world war. The gadje (non-Gypsy) world seems to have less of a problem with Romany people as long as they stay in a folkloric pigeonhole and don't grow too numerous - ie, don't appear to be real people with real housing needs, hunger and educational ambitions for their children.</p> <p>The invitation extended by the BNP to Petra Edelmannov\u00e1 is significant because the historical treatment of the Roma in the Czech Lands provides an instructive example to modern Europe. In more than one European country, the roundup of Roma and Sinti people under Nazi occupation was made much easier by pre-existing legislation. In Czechoslovakia, as it then was, restrictive legislation against Gypsies was brought in as early as 1927. Law 117 required all Gypsies to be fingerprinted and to provide details of their movements around the country. The evidence gathered under Law 117 facilitated the internment of Bohemian and Moravian Roma when the occupying German army decided the time had come. In August 1942, under the guise of a so-called Registration Day, the Roma and Sinti were rounded up and imprisoned in two camps, Lety in Bohemia and Hodinin in Moravia. After a year, most of the inhabitants of those camps were sent on to Auschwitz, where they were murdered. Of the 6,500 Roma in the Czech lands at the start of the war, fewer than 500 survived. What began with fingerprints in 1927 ended 16 years later in the gas chambers. </p> <p>To draw analogies between the Nazi-perpetrated Holocaust and the current situation for European Roma may seem alarmist, but in 1927 anyone who predicted the fate of the Czech lands in the 1940s would certainly have been regarded as alarmist to the point of lunacy. Czechoslovakia was a thriving democracy that had shaken off the shackles of the Austro-Hungarian Empire to emerge as one of the top 10 economically developed countries in the world.</p> <p>The true numbers of Roma and Sinti people murdered by the Nazis will never be known - official estimates vary between one quarter and half a million, although many Romany experts believe a million might be nearer the mark. What is indisputable is that the Roma and Sinti were persecuted to roughly the same percentage of their population, around 85%, as Jewish people - and for the same racial reasons. Where the two genocides differ is that although the Jewish Holocaust was always openly racist, the Roma and Sinti were initially persecuted for being \"asocials\" and, for many years, successive German governments refused to recognise the racial element of the Nazis' actions.</p> <p>This insistence that the exclusion of and discrimination against Gypsies has more to do with lifestyle than race has found its echo in recent events in Italy. In May, a woman in Ponticelli, outside Naples, reported that a Gypsy woman had attempted to abduct her baby. Whether the report was true or not made no difference to the thugs who descended with iron bars and torches upon local camps and slum housing. The response of the Berlusconi government and its allies was breathtakingly cynical. First came the announcement in June that all Gypsies, children included, would be fingerprinted and, crucially, identified by their ethnicity - a move unprecedented in postwar western Europe. Terry Davis, the secretary general of the Council of Europe, responded that such a scheme \"invites historical analogies which are so obvious that they do not have to be spelled out\". Even Berlusconi proved sensitive to the international outrage that ensued and the plans have now been modified so that all Italian citizens will be fingerprinted by 2010. The authorities have stated that ethnicity will not feature in this nationwide census, but their idea of reassurance is to present the measure as a general anti-immigration measure, rather than one aimed specifically at the country's 150,000 Roma and Sinti.</p> <p>These moves would be sinister enough on their own, but they come accompanied by repeated and unpunished attacks upon Italy's estimated 700 camps. In July, the world was shocked by photographs of the bodies of two drowned Roma girls left lying on a beach outside Naples, while people sunbathed and picnicked nearby.</p> <p>Of the many chilling quotes that have been forthcoming from Italy's political leaders since the attacks began in May, possibly the most frightening is that from Umberto Bossi of the far-right Northern League, a minister in Berlusconi's government. \"The people do what the political class isn't able to do.\" The clear implication is that the politicians endorse \"ethnic cleansing\" and rather wish they could get away with formalising the arrangement. </p> <p>Italy's Romanies, many already living in the most appalling economic circumstances, can be forgiven for feeling under siege. \"Have you come to hunt us or help us?\" asked Rogi, a resident of a small camp just outside Rome. He was speaking to a group of 10 Red Cross volunteers who arrived at the camp in July to conduct a census. The volunteers were not fingerprinting but they were asking each resident for their name, age, nationality, if they had been vaccinated and if their children were going to school - and they were photographing them. According to the news agency AFP, the Red Cross was insistent that this was not a police operation, rather aimed at providing the camp residents with health cards. \"Mostly they have worms, gastro-intestinal illnesses and bronchitis,\" one worker reportedly said. \"As for the authorities, we can provide them with anonymous information so that they are able to assess the camps, hygiene and health conditions.\"</p> <p>Whether or not the Red Cross operation is going to help the inhabitants of such camps or the authorities who would like the camps cleared remains to be seen, but no one can blame the residents, many of whom are Romanians without papers, for feeling deeply suspicious of people in uniform who want to take their photographs and ask a lot of questions. Such suspicion has wide historical precedent. </p> <p>The slaughter of the second world war was merely the apotheosis of centuries of persecution throughout the Roma's tragic European history. Although awareness of the Romany Holocaust is now well established, few people know that for five and a half centuries, thousands of Romanies in eastern Europe were bought and sold as slaves. According to Ian Hancock in his book, We Are the Romani People, \"In the 16th century, a Romani child could be purchased for 32p. By the 19th century, slaves were sold by weight, at the rate of one gold piece per pound.\"</p> <p>Throughout this history, Roma and Sinti people have traditionally survived by remaining out of sight as much as possible. In Poland, a small number of Polska Roma survived the Nazi genocide by hiding in remote forests. In Bohemia and Moravia, a few families were sheltered by Czech villagers. On a wider level, many Romanies or Travellers simply don't mention their family backgrounds. On a writers' tour of Romania in 2000, one friend said to me, \"I think the attitude of most people here would be, we don't understand why you talk about having Gypsy blood. If you kept quiet about it, you could pass.\" The Roma living in appalling conditions in camps outside Rome or Naples would probably be happy not to venture out to sell trinkets or beg were it not for the fact that if they didn't, they would starve. Criticism of such subsistence activities rarely takes account of the economic necessity that underpins it. </p> <p>Another example of a Gypsy community under siege is Sulukule in Istanbul. Sulukule is an historic settlement that has been occupied by a Romany community since the time of Byzantia and is now part of a Unesco World Heritage Site. The earliest records for Roma residence in Sulukule date back to 1054 and for centuries it has been famous for its entertainment houses where the Roma performed music and dance to visitors from all over the world. The enforced closure of such houses in 1992 pitched the area and its inhabitants into serious economic decline. Again, the reasoning given was that of providing safe, hygienic housing. \"We have no intention of getting rid of the Roma but we have to do something about this slum,\" said the local mayor, Mustafa Demir. The local authorities now plan to demolish the tiny coloured houses in which the Roma live and replace them with villas that the residents could not possibly afford to rent, even with the subsidies offered. Homeless, and with no means of supporting themselves, what options will be open to them?</p> <p>Seen within their Europe-wide and historical context, events such as these have a devastating effect on the morale of the wider Roma population, not just on those directly victimised - we are, after all, talking about a people who have genocide in living memory and whom are among the most poverty-stricken and excluded in Europe. These developments are viewed by Roma and Sinti people across Europe with mounting anxiety. For every firebomb thrown into a camp or slum dwelling, for every municipal move to get Romanies to move on, there are thousand petty incidents of scorn or prejudice. As one English Traveller acquaintance once put it to me, \"Whenever anyone says to me, 'Oh it must be so romantic being a Gypsy,' I say, 'What's romantic about being spat at?'\"</p> <p>What is undeniable in this picture is that the current moves by both the government of Italy and British local councils such as Brentwood will only exacerbate the tensions between Romany or Traveller and settled populations. The immigrant Roma in Italy are there because they left countries such as Romania in search of better lives. The residents of Sulukule will have to go somewhere when the demolition trucks move in. Travellers turned off the land they own in Cambridgeshire or Essex will be forced to camp by the side of the road or on publicly owned recreation grounds. Bernadette Reilly remembers saying to one police officer who was moving the family on from the side of the road one night, \"Where do you expect us to go?\"</p> <p>\"Anywhere,\" the officer replied. \"Just not in my borough.\"</p> <p>However often the Romany and Traveller communities of Europe are moved on, from borough to borough or across national boundaries, they will not fade away or melt into thin air. Until there is pan-European political will to address the poverty and exclusion that many face, the situation can only worsen, and the right wing will continue to use this marginalised group as a vote-scoring chip. At my father's 80th birthday party, I told my aunt about his remark referring to bricks through windows, expecting her to agree with me that my father was an incorrigible worrier. Instead, she said quietly, \"He's got a point, love, hasn't he?\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Louise Doughty's novels about Roma history and her family ancestry are Fires in the Dark and Stone Cradle, both published by Simon &amp; Schuster.</p>",
  "<p>'Would you like a flag?\" beams a steward, brandishing fistfuls. It is Saturday evening and I am outside the Royal Albert Hall for the Last Night of the Proms where, I have been reliably informed, flag waving is heartily encouraged. I take two paper flags and hold them nervously. </p> <p>I am feeling apprehensive about attending the Proms. I know what to expect: thousands of pink-faced people wearing the union flag on their shirts, backs and heads. This, it is fair to say, does not constitute my idea of a good time. I am not a fan of raucous patriotism or classical music, so what am I doing here?</p> <p>Earlier this year the culture minister Margaret Hodge gave a speech in which she appeared to criticise the Proms for not doing more to appeal to a more diverse audience. \"The audiences for many of our greatest cultural events - I'm thinking in particular of the Proms - is still a long way from demonstrating that people from different backgrounds feel at ease in being part of this,\" she told the Institute of Public Policy Research. Her comments immediately drew a rebuke from Gordon Brown, who declared the Proms to be \"wonderful, democratic and quintessentially British,\" while David Cameron also praised the Proms, adding \"we want more things where people come together to celebrate Britishness.\" </p> <p>I wasn't sure what to think. The only way to find out was to go along, and so I find myself outside the Albert Hall at the end of a snaking line of ticket holders dressed in plastic hats and capes emblazoned with the union flag. I am still holding the paper flags but it is hard to write in my notebook at the same time. I want to dispose of them, but am worried that there may be some archaic law that forbids dumping of union flags outside the Albert Hall during the Proms. I don't want to be seen as a Britain basher so I keep hold of the flags as I take my seat in the stalls.</p> <p>The entire hall is festooned with them - not only the union flag but also German, French, South African and Swedish flags. One man is flying a flag emblazoned with the Olympic Rings. </p> <p>I am struck by how good-natured the atmosphere is; it feels like a party, but one where classical music is being celebrated. That's in keeping with the ethos of the Proms, which were founded in 1895 to give ordinary people a chance to listen to classical music. Once the programme of music starts the hall falls silent, save for the occasional deflating balloon careening through the air, and the crowd listen respectfully. I resolve to monitor how at ease I feel throughout the evening. </p> <p>The first half of the programme - Beethoven, Wagner, Puccini and Verdi - is performed to loud cheers, but I get the feeling that the main action will be towards the end. During the interval I talk to a man wearing a shirt with a union flag pattern. His name is Branko Bjelobaba. \"Serbian ancestry,\" he explains. \"Do you wear this shirt often?\" I ask. \"No, only here,\" he says. \"What other night do Brits get a chance to sing the national anthem or fly the union flag? They don't even do it at the Tory conference any more, do they?\" </p> <p>I remember watching those Tory conferences when I was younger and, like the Last Night of the Proms, the version of Britishness they endorsed was both alienating and troubling. It didn't reflect the Britain I lived in. For some that is no bad thing. In the days leading up to my Proms night I stumble upon a far-right website where someone has written that they have \"just been watching the Proms on the BBC. What a glorious sight - not a jig in the hall. Every member of the 300-strong orchestra are White. Every member of the audience is White. No Hijabs. No Turbans. No Skullcaps. No Afros. Just White people enjoying their culture and history.\" </p> <p>Of course, the Proms are more than just the last night, and the entire programme is much more diverse in content, if not audience, but as I return to the hall for the second half it is hard not to notice that the last night is overwhelmingly white. I think I see an Asian man somewhere in the distance, but he may just be a white man who has returned from his holiday with a tan. I check my ease-ometer though, and find that this does not make me uneasy. The truth is that as a British Pakistani whose musical tastes tend less towards </p> <p>Bollywood or R&amp;B and more towards alternative country and rock, I have gotten used to being one of the few non-white faces in a concert. </p> <p>The second half begins with some traditional folk songs, a fanfare chorus and Vaughan Williams' Sea Songs before the traditional closing numbers: Rule Britannia!, Pomp and Circumstance, Jerusalem and the national anthem. If ever I was going to feel uneasy, this would be the moment. For these climactic anthems the entire hall is on its feet and the floor of the arena is a sea of flags as the collective voice of the audience swirls and floats across the hall. On television these scenes may seem excessively jingoistic. In the hall itself, instead of feeling uneasy, I am rather moved. Everyone around me is singing with such passion and heart. It is as if months of pent-up reticence about being seen as patriotic is exploding in one night of orgiastic abandon. For the final song, Auld Lang Syne, I link arms with those next to me and wish I was here with friends rather than on my own.</p> <p>Then the audience begins filing out. On my way out I see a man in a plastic bowler hat and a huge union flag. \"What is the appeal of the Proms?\" I ask. \"I am here with my mother,\" he says, \"we both watch the Proms on television and I wanted to take her.\" \"I can't help noticing that your accent is not English,\" I say. \"That's right,\" he says, \"I am actually German.\" \"So what's with the bowler hat and flag?\" \"It's just my way of expressing my fondness for this country,\" he says. I notice an Asian couple. \"How did you find that?\" I ask. \"Fantastic,\" says the man, who tells me his name is Alan Rajah. \"this is our fourth time at the Last Night of the Proms.\" \"We love it,\" adds his wife Anne (actually Anwaree). \"And were you waving the flag?\" I ask. \"Of course!\" they say in unison. </p> <p>There was a time when the Last Night of the Proms was the dominant version of Britishness, and in that guise, it is not surprising it made some feel uneasy. That is no longer true in today's multicultural Britain. No one complains that the London Mela was excessively Asian, or that the Mobo awards are predominantly black, so does it even matter if the last night is overwhelmingly white? It would be wonderful if more non-whites were in attendance, if only because they would get a chance to hear some fantastic music; that more do not attend is hardly the fault of the Proms. But by the end of the evening I am convinced that, far from being anachronistic, the last night embodies so much of what I, and so many children of immigrants, love about this country. The evening is a celebration of Britain and music, two things I am happy to champion. But rather than being unpleasantly jingoistic it is benign, eccentric, impassioned and good-natured: the best of British. </p> <p>I head home, Elgar echoing in my head, my heart filled with hope and not a little glory.</p>",
  "<p>Contrary to all our expectations, the revolution is being televised. Death by friendly fire, and in primetime. But we see only a fraction of the fear and loathing that has gripped the party, and it is behind the scenes that things are at their ugliest. Who, for instance, used Labour's internal mail to send a message dripping with disloyalty to all the party's MPs yesterday, copying them in on the thoughts of our own Polly Toynbee? \"The ineptitude of Brown's Downing Street worsens by the week,\" she wrote in the article, first published on these pages, now recirculated. \"Unseating a prime minister is very high risk - but a dying party should be ready to take dangerous medicine if that's the last chance left.\" To ram the message home, the subversive - thought to be a whip or a party staffer with access to the internal mail - appended a typed message of their own. \"In a couple of years, when the Tory government's cuts are hitting schools and hospitals in our former constituencies, will you too regret having done nothing now,\" it asked MPs pointedly. Trouble abroad. Trouble at mill.</p> <p>But then it is virtually impossible to plot where the allegiances lie. Who knows why any of them say what they say when they say it? Yesterday David Evans, Labour's former assistant general secretary, popped up on the World at One on Radio 4 to give succour to the rebels. He was \"baffled\" as to why leadership nomination papers had not been issued to MPs prior to conference. But how, said the haters - the usual suspects - can you trust a man who called his cats Margaret and Siobhan after Margaret McDonagh, the Blairite former general secretary and her sister Siobhan McDonagh, the assistant whip sacked by Gordon on Friday after she so publicly lost the faith. This may or not be true (our call was not returned; a friend of his says it isn't), but what it does show is that even pets are now in the firing line. Heads down everyone, and you Tiddles. Incoming.</p> <p>But who says the other parties are any better? Consider the plight of poor Caroline Lucas, supreme leader of the Greens, who was due to speak at the annual Stephen Lawrence memorial lecture last week at the Royal Institute of British Architects, but could not do so because Eurotunnel's little difficulty prevented her from making it back across the Channel. Into the breach stepped Quentin Tyler, her policy adviser, who read her speech on building sustainable communities. But despite admitting that he was just one day into the job, Tyler quickly departed from Lucas's given text to question what on earth his boss meant by a \"toy library\". A passage praising the sustainability of Poundbury's old-fashioned housing, being built \"under the watchful eye of Prince Charles\", proved even more troubling for the leader's surrogate. \"I have to go a bit off-message here and say I don't think that's a very good example,\" he declared. \"What's your probation period at work?\" the bemused chairwoman asked him. We did wonder. </p> <p>But perhaps we shouldn't have been surprised, for these are the times in which we live. The old ways are dying out. The rules mean nothing. What other conclusion can there be following the shameful events at a Christian Aid-Liberal Democrat fringe meeting in Bournemouth yesterday, when a protester brandishing handcuffs slapped them on to the wrists of an executive from E.ON - the company promoting the controversial Kingsnorth power station scheme in Kent - only to take them off again after five minutes' barracking from the audience and from the chairman. This is what passes for militancy these days. Sad, really.</p> <p>When Noel Edmonds refuses to pay his BBC licence fee - as he has done for the past four months, an act of law-breaking designed to confront the corporation's \"hectoring and threatening\" of an ordinary man - he throws up challenging questions to all who cherish our free and liberal society. Are we duty-bound to uphold the rights of the defendant, no matter what, is one we have been grappling with. And where might we find the right magistrate? A really nasty one.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:diary@theguardian.com\">diary@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>In a letter to the editor of a London free sheet, Richard House got straight into his polemical stride. \"The fact that the newly introduced Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) 'curriculum' encourages you 'to teach children through play' succinctly sums up all that's wrong with it,\" he says. \"The very idea that it is appropriate to have a 'curriculum' for young children is absurd and represents a totally inappropriate encroachment of a schooling ideology into the lives of young children.\"</p> <p>House has been composing countless such \"rants\", as he cheerfully describes them, for 30 years. \"Throughout the Thatcher years, I had a great time writing letters exposing privatisation scandals.\" He says he \"can't just bystand\" when he sees injustice. And that is why, alongside his day jobs as a university lecturer, psychotherapist and Steiner kindergarten teacher, House has been at the forefront of the Open Eye (early years education) campaign, which opposes the so-called \"nappy curriculum\" for under-fives that came into law this month. </p> <p>The campaign, which has no official leader or paid staff, has, largely thanks to House himself, had some impressive PR successes since it sprang on to the scene last year with a letter signed by notables such as childcare guru Penelope Leach and the author Philip Pullman.</p> <p>It appeared to score a triumph in July, when the government agreed to review the two most controversial of its 69 targets - that by about age five, most children will be able to use phonics to write simple regular words and attempt more complex words; and write their own names and begin to form simple sentences, sometimes using punctuation.</p> <p><strong>Effect on teaching</strong></p> <p>But House isn't satisfied with this. These goals could have been suspended, he says. They and the other 67 \"affect the whole mentality that teachers have. They'll be thinking about Ofsted and pressure from their local authorities to meet targets.\"</p> <p>Some of his campaigning motivation comes from his work as a psychotherapist. \"You soon find out that most of the problems adults have have their roots in childhood experience.\" he says. \"What can we do to lessen the possibility of children growing up with neurotic conditions?\"</p> <p>Just as he was wrestling with such questions in the early 1990s, he discovered the Steiner movement, and his talent for working with young children. It was the Steiner training that made him worry about Labour's early childhood education policies - the first of which, in 1998, did not even mention play. </p> <p>The Steiner philosophy opposes \"waking children up\" from their dreamlike, childish state before they are developmentally ready, around age six-and-a-half or seven. Little children learn unconsciously, through experiences, and should have opportunities to do real things like baking bread and planting a garden, rather than having their play harnessed to external learning goals. \"Young children are extraordinary beings. You only have to watch a young child seeing something for the first time to see the extraordinary wonder and reverence young children have for the world. It should be nurtured and not intruded upon.\" His 11-year-old daughter has just started secondary school: \"Thankfully she is a wonderfully sociable and adaptable child, who would thrive pretty much wherever she found herself.\" </p> <p><strong>The drive to campaign</strong></p> <p>Despite years of self-development and psychotherapy (which all therapists have), House can't really pin down what is behind his drive to campaign. Before becoming a therapist in 1990, he worked in publishing, switching his interest gradually from environmental sciences (in which he has a PhD) to education. </p> <p>Today he works three days a week as senior lecturer at the Research Centre for Therapeutic Education at Roehampton University, which trains psychotherapists and counsellors. It is his first university job, for which he was headhunted three years ago at the unusually advanced age of 50. A self-described \"compulsive writer\", House had a sideline as an independent academic for some 10 years before that, publishing countless articles and papers in magazines, journals and books. </p> <p>\"I am regarded as something of an 'activist-academic' - and in some circles at least, I think that's seen as being a very difficult position to take up, even one that is a contradiction in terms,\" he says. </p> <p>After years as a Bennite Labour supporter, he's now a Green Party member, and the eco-aura is enhanced by a lilting Somerset accent. Though he currently lives in West London, he remains an avid Yeovil Town FC supporter - and it is not lost on him that the team is known as \"the giant killers\". (The team, which spent most of its history outside the football league, defeated top-ranking Sunderland in 1948.) \"I have a similar tendency to take on giants.\" </p> <p>He finds it painful to be at odds with the Labour Party. Both Tories and Lib Dems have early childhood education policies that are more in keeping with the Open Eye campaign's views.</p> <p>His present wave of campaigning began in 2006, when he read about Sue Palmer's then forthcoming book, Toxic Childhood, which decries the pressures modern life is placing upon children. House and Palmer, also an inveterate campaigner and prolific writer, were plainly destined to be a fighting team. </p> <p>First they wrote the influential Toxic Childhood letter, signed by 110 teachers, authors and experts including neuroscientist Baroness Susan Greenfield and the author Jacqueline Wilson, calling on the government to act to prevent the death of childhood. \"Today's children are expected to cope with an ever-earlier start to formal schoolwork and an overly academic test-driven primary curriculum,\" they wrote. </p> <p>They kept the movement going with events such as a seminar for politicians. The Open Eye campaign is following a similar path. First the multi-signatory letter, then seminars, a petition and more letters. A policy seminar in London next month will be followed by an international conference next year.</p> <p>House hopes the seminar will provide a chance for opposing parties to find common ground. \"There's been very little listening going on, and maybe that applies to us as well,\" he says. He also wants to clarify Open Eye's position. \"We've been labelled as an anti-EYFS campaign. We are anti certain clearly defined aspects of the EYFS.\" Its welfare regulations, however, are \"sensible and very child-centred\".</p> <p>If Open Eye succeeds in its aims, that will be no reason to stop campaigning. All the members of Open Eye share a vision about saving childhood. \"There's no reason it should be confined to the first five years,\" says House.</p>",
  "<h2>19 arrested as toxic milk toll exceeds 1,200 infants</h2> <p>The number of infants made ill by tainted milk powder doubled yesterday to 1,253 - more than twice the number previously acknowledged - as police announced the first arrests in the scandal. The health ministry said a second infant had died of kidney failure after drinking Sanlu formula laced with melamine. Sanlu says suppliers who sold the raw milk allegedly added the chemical, which is used in plastics, to boost protein content. Zhang Zhenling, the Sanlu vice-president, said: \"We feel really sad about this.\" Police have arrested 19 people, including two brothers who ran a milk collection centre. <br><strong>Associated Press in Beijing</strong></p> <h2>Dog dials 911 after owner suffers seizure</h2> <p>A German shepherd dog saved his owner's life by calling the emergency services when the man had a seizure. During a recording of the call to 911, Buddy is heard whimpering and barking after the controller, Chris Trott, repeatedly asks if the caller needs help. Joe Stalnaker spent two days in hospital and recovered from the seizure after officers in Scottsdale, near Phoenix, responded to the call. They said Stalnaker's address was flagged in the system with a notification that a trained assistance dog could call the emergency services when the owner was incapacitated. <br><strong>Associated Press in Phoenix</strong></p> <h2>Ramadan cash handout triggers deadly stampede</h2> <p>At least 23 people were killed yesterday in a stampede after crowds battled to get their share of alms handed out as a Ramadan gift. The dead, mostly women, were crushed against railings or trampled to death after several thousand people surged forward to receive the cash in the east Java town of Pasuruan. Eight others were in a critical condition after the crowd tried to claim between just 30,000 and 40,000 rupiah (\u00a31.59 and \u00a32.13) each.

General Rasim Delic was sentenced to three years in prison because Islamic volunteers under his command abused the prisoners in the summer of 1995. Delic is the most senior Bosnian Muslim officer convicted by the court in its 15-year history.

  "<p>Rule No1 in English club rugby should be inscribed on a slab of marble and displayed at Twickenham: never write off Wasps. Last season they failed to win any of their first four Premiership games and were in 10th place in December, yet they still managed to be English champions for the fourth time in six seasons. No one ever fashioned a drama out of a supposed crisis quite like Lawrence Dallaglio's big-match specialists.</p> <p>Given the context, defeats in Wasps' first two league games of 2008-09 are almost par for the course. This is September, not April, and there is plenty of time in which to restore the high life to High Wycombe. Nor is losing by an injury-time penalty at home to an improving Worcester a sure indicator of a pear-shaped season, any more than Manchester United's defeat at Liverpool proved the round-ball champions to have totally lost the plot.</p> <p>Yet even Ian McGeechan, Wasps' director of rugby, currently sounds slightly more concerned than usual. Dallaglio and Fraser Waters are gone, and those meant to fill their boots have yet to do so. Wasps are not built on a foundation of expensive signings, billionaire investors or fast-revolving turnstiles, but on character and bloody-mindedness. In a perverse way, starting slowly almost does them a favour in terms of encouraging those competitive juices to start fermenting. But faithful servants such as Rapha\u00ebl Ibanez, Simon Shaw - both injured at the weekend - and Phil Vickery are not getting any younger and Danny Cipriani is attracting plenty of newspaper coverage only because his idea of rehabilitating his damaged ankle involves frequent public games of footsie with glamorous partners. Wasps need him back on the field, out of harm's way.</p> <p>There is also the changing game itself to consider. Because of the experimental law variations and stricter policing of the breakdown, the playing field has been levelled in areas where Wasps were pre-eminent. The emphasis on tactical kicking and increased focus on the breakdown are forcing even skilled counterattacking sides such as Wasps to think twice before running out of defence; uncertainty was rife against London Irish on the opening weekend. </p> <p>\"We sometimes try to play too much rugby,\" said McGeechan. \"We have to try to pick our times. We're not as competitive as we need to be and in this league you can't afford that. We should have beaten Worcester comfortably ... we have to focus on what we want to do as a club.\"</p> <p>The chief executive, Tony Copsey, was similarly blunt yesterday, suggesting England might end up borrowing fewer Wasps than expected this autumn. \"If they carry on playing the crap they've served up in the last two weeks - apart from Tom Rees and Phil Vickery, who have had two good games - none of them will be picked and we'll be at full strength,\" he said. \"September is not Wasps' month but we all recognised we needed a good start to the season, which we haven't had. We can't seem to buck this habit and we're not relaxed about it. We're incredibly annoyed and 'angry' is the best word to describe the mood at the moment. We're all angry with the way we've performed, as well as disappointed. No one feels it more than the players and more than anyone else they're the ones who will put it right.\"</p> <p>Copsey knows that, when a recession hits, it helps to have a winning team. Sunday's modest attendance of 7,668 was not reassuring, but he said: \"September's always a bad month for rugby. I don't know why but football doesn't really suffer in the same way. It would be too simple to cite the changeover from cricket to rugby and say a lot of people are on holiday but there certainly is a hangover effect from the summer. It takes two games before everyone wakes up.\"</p> <p>Perhaps the same will apply to the players. This weekend they head for Northampton, and the hugely respected French flanker Serge Betsen could be found limbering up against Worcester in the A League at Henley last night. But McGeechan and his head coach, Shaun Edwards, have pressing international commitments - the Lions are paying McGeechan's salary this season, meaning he is technically on a club sabbatical, and Edwards is Wales's assistant coach - and the playing resources are not the deepest. Wasps' thoroughbreds cannot afford to loiter in the stalls indefinitely.</p>",
  "<p>Celtic's chief executive, Peter Lawwell, has emerged as the football man in the running for the \u00a31m-a-year vacancy at Arsenal. The 49-year-old will find out in the next fortnight if he has been selected from the two-man shortlist ahead of Paul Donovan, Vodafone's chief executive for central Europe, the Middle East and Asia. </p> <p>Lawwell is considered a tough transfer negotiator at Celtic and has excellent contacts in European football - not least at Uefa, where his fellow Scot, David Taylor, is general secretary. Having substantially lifted Celtic's turnover during his spell at Parkhead, his CV appears well suited to Arsenal. His background is as an accountant and finance director, having had a spell in the property-development business on the Clydeport authority, fitting in with many of the core skills Arsenal require of their new broom.</p> <p>The club is set to announce a strong set of half-year accounts this week, with further discussion of whom to appoint at a board meeting on Thursday.</p> <p>But balanced against Lawwell's football experience is the FTSE100 profile of the Arsenal season-ticket holder Donovan, whose company is a top-line sponsor of Uefa's Champions League. His experience of and contacts in central European, Middle Eastern and Asian markets might also suit him to dialogue with potential purchasers.</p> <p>Arsenal's board, who engaged the headhunters Spencer Stuart to deliver a \u00a31m-a-year chief executive, insists it has no desire to discuss a takeover.</p> <h2>Barwick's sporting chance</h2> <p>A possible absentee at the top table at today's FA council meeting is occupying the thoughts of its membership. Brian Barwick - set to leave Soho Square at the end of the year - has been a popular and influential figure among councillors, having persuaded FA grassroots to accept the Burns reforms which led to the appointment of Lord Triesman - who then decided to put Barwick, pictured below, on his bike. If he turns up, this may be the councillors' last chance to wish him well. Meanwhile Roger Mosey's exit as head of BBC Sport opens a potential vacancy for Barwick. The success of his anticipated candidacy depends on how much rancour persists over his sale of England and FA Cup rights to ITV and Setanta. </p> <h2>Wembley will wait</h2> <p>Wembley National Stadium Limited's board has decided to shelve the appointment of a chief executive. After a final interview with the only remaining candidate, Andrew Morris, on Friday, directors confirmed at a board meeting that WNSL would maintain the status quo that has seen Roger Maslin stabilise the business as interim managing director. The Football Association is seeking its own chief executive and head of the 2018 bid company, so WNSL will not pursue its own \u00a3500,000 recruitment before knowing who the main man will be. </p> <h2>Owner called to account</h2> <p>Mike Ashley says he has \"poured\" in \u00a3110m to reduce Newcastle United's debts but how he has done so is unclear. The companies set up by the previous regime led by Freddy Shepherd and Russell Cushing - whose boards the managing director, Derek Llambias, and operations director, David Williamson, have joined - have yet to file their accounts. For both companies the books are overdue, so it is unknown whether Ashley's contribution was a selfless donation or if he has first call on the money in the form of loans.</p> <h2>Football's own-goal</h2> <p>While Ashley puts his club on the market it emerged yesterday that 12% of the population cannot afford to watch live football even on TV. The research, commissioned by Virgin Media in consultation with Supporters Direct, might act as a warning to the new breed of owners that the golden goose will not keep laying forever. </p> <h2>LTA serves up new deal</h2> <p>At a time when questions hang over the fiscal health of Manchester United's \u00a314.1m-a-year shirt sponsor, AIG, there are signs that sport will not be abandoned by the financial services sector. The Lawn Tennis Association is set to announce the Scottish investments and insurance firm Aegon today as lead sponsor of its \u00a325m, five-year commercial-partners plan.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337631010\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1797048467_gdn-nat-080915-sf-larry-01-VFa-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>It was Black Monday. Banks going bust. Stock markets in turmoil. A nosedive in the share price of HBOS, Britain's biggest mortgage lender. The brainboxes who come up with complex models of how financial markets work say that these sorts of things are supposed to happen only once in a blue moon. But at the moment it is a case of another week, another crisis. </p> <p>A week ago it was the effective nationalisation of the American mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Yesterday, jobless bankers at Lehman Brothers were clearing their desks. With the virus spreading, there were doubts yesterday as to whether Washington Mutual, America's biggest savings and loan company, and AIG, the country's biggest insurer (and a leading sponsor of Manchester United), would survive the week. This was the week the crash of 2007-08 went nuclear.</p> <p>Clearly, the events of the weekend now make a prolonged and deep recession far more likely. Forget all the talk about soft landings, or a recession so short and sharp that it will barely be noticed. The way things stand, it is now a question of whether there is a complete meltdown of the financial system, with institutions crashing like ninepins, or whether a severe rationing of credit over a prolonged period leads to falling house prices, weaker consumer spending, lower investment and rising unemployment.</p> <p>This is without doubt the most serious financial shock since 1929, and while talk of a 1930s-style depression is still conjecture, so are the predictions that failing banks and a bankrupt financial system will have minimal impact on the \"real economy\". </p> <p>The risks are particularly acute in Britain, where the financial sector accounts for a bigger share of the economy's output than in any comparable western country, and where the cull of employees in the City will have massive ripple effects throughout London and the south-east. The casualties will not just be the highly paid bankers, for whom there will be little sympathy, but also the car dealers, the shop assistants, the restaurant staff, the cleaners and all the other people whose employment has relied on the wealth generated in the markets.</p> <p>In the light of this, the Downing Street mantra that Britain is better placed to withstand the global financial maelstrom than it was in the past is starting to grate. When the economy was booming during 2006 and 2007, almost half the growth was accounted for by financial and business services. The Office for National Statistics report, due later this autumn, will show that as manufacturing has become less important so the City has become ever more pivotal to the economy at large. Sure, Britain is good at pharmaceuticals and aerospace; it has some world-famous architects and plenty of smart lawyers. But take away the credit-fuelled housing market, and Britain is an economy with all its eggs in one basket. The stench from Canary Wharf is proof of what has long been suspected: many of those eggs were rotten.</p> <p>Despite the all-pervasive bleak mood yesterday, however, the financial storm cloud has three silver linings. Perhaps the least important is that it brings forward the timing of cuts in interest rates in the UK. For the past six months, the Bank of England has been unable to decide whether the credit crunch or rising inflation poses the bigger threat to the British economy; the latest, downward lurch in the financial markets (coupled with the drop in the oil price to below $100 a barrel) means that there are no longer any excuses for inaction from the Bank. While cheaper borrowing is no panacea for the problems of the British economy, and will come too late in any event to prevent recession, it will help to cushion the fall. A rate cut in October is quite possible in the light of what has happened so far this month.</p> <p>The second reason for a bit of cautious optimism is that the action taken by the United States Treasury and the Federal Reserve over the weekend seems to be making the best of a bad job. This point should not be exaggerated, since central banks and finance ministries have seen every firebreak created since the start of the crisis quickly overwhelmed by the force of the financial inferno. But, just like a retreating army, it makes sense for the authorities to dig in to a more defensible position, and they may now have done that by abandoning Lehman Brothers, orchestrating the takeover of Merrill Lynch - the next most vulnerable investment bank - by Bank of America; and by widening the list of collateral the Fed will accept when it lends to the financial sector.</p> <p>But the most important reason for a modicum of optimism is that the decision by the American authorities to let Lehman Brothers go down marks the death of denial. Since the markets froze in August 2007, the presumption has been that, with a bit of tinkering here and a bail-out there, it will be possible to return to the world as it existed before anyone had heard of sub-prime mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. Mervyn King became a hate figure in UK banking circles for his reluctance to write blank cheques to those who had behaved imprudently, but the Bank of England governor's concerns about moral hazard have been vindicated. </p> <p>It has taken a long time for the authorities in the US to recognise that there was something dysfunctional about the model of global finance that developed in the decade up to August 2007, with its emphasis on exploding credit, an array of incomprehensible derivative products and the alleged spreading of risk. For some of us, it has become obvious that this model is broken beyond repair, and that there now needs to be a return to more traditional forms of banking. The fact that there is now talk of the need for a new Glass-Steagall law - the 1930s legislation that meant US institutions could either be retail banks or investment banks but not both - is a recognition that the world has changed. When the dust eventually settles on this crisis, and that may well be some time, the division between the pre-crash and post-crash world will be as stark as that between Edwardian and post-first world war Britain.</p> <p>For the time being this is of secondary importance. The priority for policymakers is not the punishing regime that the patient will require when it comes out of the financial recovery; it is to stop the bleeding. The global banks' problems have their origin in the boom and bust in the US housing market, and until prices and activity stabilise they will continue to rack up losses. Hopes that the property market has bottomed out are unlikely to survive the current bout of extreme turbulence, but once the immediate crisis is over there will be far-reaching changes to credit creation, regulation and the permitted activities of banks.

  "<p>University offers the chance to try out all those sports and societies you never even suspected might interest you - and, often, to discover that they don't.</p> <p>It is wise to make this discovery sometime after bagging two free drinks and a T-shirt, and before taking out a lifetime subscription to the newsletter. Unfortunately, the society's recruitment strategy is likely to favour the other way around, and can be hard to resist. Never underestimate how easy it is to find yourself signing up to membership of the Trainspotters' Ceilidh Society after a few drinks and an earful of bagpipes.</p> <p>For this reason, it is a good idea to research the societies available at your university by checking out their websites or related Facebook entries before running the gauntlet of freshers' fair.</p> <p>That way you'll be able to approach the event with an air of purpose rather than being fair game for anyone with a clipboard and a goody bag. </p> <p>Always try to attend a society's social event before committing yourself to membership and don't be tempted to join a society just because your friend does. Remember, this is freshers' week, so the likelihood is you won't be friends for long. You don't want to feel obliged to play tiddlywinks with them every Tuesday for the next three years.</p> <p>Although freshers' fair is traditionally the time to sign up to societies, it is usually possible to join at any time during your university career. However, people are always more suspicious of enthusiasts than freeloaders, so if you do join after the freebies have run out you may cause some of your fellow members to worry about your motives.</p> <p>If your motives are political, then it's often a good idea to join as many societies as possible so that your name gets around. Those keen to have an executive position may be better off considering something small, such as the chess club, where competition for key posts will be less fierce. </p> <p>Even if your motives are less ambitious, it is still a good idea to sort out what they are, and whether a particular society meets them, before you join up.</p> <p>While some sports societies may put you on track for a place in the 2012 Olympics, others will offer a sure route to getting bladdered every Saturday night. A good tip is to join societies that will offer you access to equipment that otherwise would be hard to use, such as cameras or recording studios. But do think hard about the potential costs in time and money that different societies demand, and whether you will be able to meet them. </p> <p>It is always possible, too, to start a society yourself. You'll just need to check that nothing similar already exists, get together a list of other potential members, and contact your students' union with the name and aims of the club. At least that way you can be sure you'll find it interesting, even if it ends up being just you.</p>",
  "<p>The collapse of Lehman Brothers, the swallowing up of Merrill Lynch, the threat to the world's biggest insurance company, AIG, and the nationalisation of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, together with Northern Rock, herald the end of the free-wheeling deregulatory era of finance capitalism that lasted from the early 1980s to 2007 (Reports, September 15). </p> <p>Many other pillars of the capitalist establishment - Halifax Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS, Deutsche Bank Citibank and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole - are widely thought to be undercapitalised and therefore at risk. But are the Asian sovereign funds now going to fund the gap after the US Treasury's punitive treatment of investors in Lehman, and Freddie and Fannie?</p> <p>We urgently need a radical new architecture for financial markets - one that puts emphasis on security and trust, rather than high risk and greed.</p> <p>The outline of this is already clear. Investment banks should be statutorily separated from the high-street commercial banks (the repeal of the US Glass-Steagall Act in 1999 was a major mistake). Securitisation - the trading worldwide of complex and obscure financial derivatives - should be prohibited, or at least subject to approval by a revamped Financial Services Authority. Credit rating agencies should be made independent of the institutions whose creditworthiness they assess (astonishingly at present, they are not). And the City mega-bonus culture which has driven the recklessness of toxic lending should be brought under control by enforceable Bank of England guidelines and by requiring fancy remuneration packages to be sanctioned by a more interventionist FSA. <br><strong>Michael Meacher MP</strong><br>Labour, Oldham West &amp; Royton</p> <p>Alan Greenspan's stark warning that the calamitous fallout from the credit crunch is \"probably a once in a century type event\" underscores the need to update Roosevelt's New Deal. </p> <p>This summer a group of finance and environmental experts did just this with their publication The Green New Deal. This detailed the reregulation of the finance sector required, and explained how to boost government funding through minimising tax evasion. This would help fund a multibillion pound crash programme to make every building in the country energy-efficient, while maximising the UK's use of small and large-scale renewables. A \"carbon army\" would need to be created and trained to fill hundreds of thousands of green-collar jobs, ranging from energy finance and analysis, through large-scale engineering, to installing renewables, draft stripping and loft-lagging. </p> <p>These measures would compensate for the job losses and deflation inevitable in the wake of the credit crunch, as well as help tackle climate change by reducing the use of fossil fuels.</p> <p>Dare we hope that these events will propel Gordon Brown into announcing just such a Green New Deal approach at the Labour party conference. At a stroke, such a job-creating, business-generating initiative could benefit us all, as well as begin to re-establish the prime minister's tarnished reputation for economic competence.<br><strong>Colin Hines</strong><br>Convenor, Green New Deal Group</p> <p>When the government had to nationalise Northern Rock and calls were made for more regulation of the financial services sector, the Treasury secretary was sent scurrying off to a banquet in the City of London to assure responsible bankers and greedy gamblers alike that no notice would be taken of these demands. Neoliberalism would continue to rule. Since that time, bank collapses and the forced nationalisation of mortgage companies in the US have demonstrated once again that neoliberal free market capitalism is a disaster. </p> <p>Yet instead of taking action to retreat from Margaret Thatcher's policies, the government (along with the Tories) looks set to remain in its grip. It now seems that the Liberal Democrats have a fairer and a far more responsible economic policy than Labour.<br><strong>Brian Abbott</strong><br>Cork, Ireland</p> <p>Max Hastings is right to say that the credit crunch is a crisis of capitalism (Comment, September 15). It's high time that Gordon Brown, instead of apologising for the credit crunch, puts most of the blame where it belongs - on a system of unregulated banks which tell governments to stay away from them when they are successful, but when they are in financial difficulty, look to taxpayers to bail them out. And that shallow man leading the Tory party should now say where he stands. Would he repeat Thatchers mantra, \"stand on your own two feet\", or would he nationalise failing banks as Bush has?<br><strong>David Buckle</strong><br>Abingdon, Oxfordshire</p> <p>I would have thought now would be a prime time for the UK to seek the safe haven of the eurozone rather than let the pound be subject to vagaries of the continuing financial storm. Will the antis continue to say the UK does not need to be a part of a larger financial system as a bulwark to the US's continuing laissez-faire attitude to world finance?<br><strong>Paul Curtis</strong><br>Woodhall Spa, Lincolnshire</p> <p>Let's stop wasting our money on the Iraq war, Trident and armies of useless consultants, and invest directly in British manufacturing. Then our children might be able to give the bankers the finger. And you never know, there might be enough money left over for local councils to start building houses again.<br><strong>Helen Rees</strong><br>Southampton </p> <p>As more financial dominoes tumble, with the demise of Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers, it seems that Bush's enduring legacy might well be the collapse of the capitalist system.

  "<p><strong>Prince William</strong> is to undergo training with the RAF's Search and Rescue Force, prior to an operational attachment of at least 30 months.

  "<p>For many fans and musicians, heavy metal is about escape - escape from boring towns, boring jobs and boring day-to-day lives. Acrassicauda, Iraq's only metal band, are the exact opposite: their lives are anything but boring. They live with the danger of getting killed, and every minute is precious. </p> <p>The documentary film Heavy Metal in Baghdad shows a band trying to reflect the realities of Iraq in their music, and at the same time using metal therapeutically, just to get through the day. People think of metal players as aggressive, but this film shows it's really a way to release aggression. Music is obviously a massive deal for these guys. When they're in the rehearsal room together, it's the one aspect of their lives they can control.</p> <p>Metal is not generally seen as political music, although bands like Metallica do a lot about nuclear war and politicians using soldiers as cannon fodder. Acrassicauda claim they are not a political band, but they can't help being so. The fact that they are defying their country's regime just by existing is a political statement. </p> <p>Are they any good? Well, the music is fairly basic, but you can see the seeds of a good band in there. They sound like a rudimentary garage band starting out and fumbling their way through. </p> <p>The problem is that they don't have much chance to practise, especially since their rehearsal room was blown up. And they certainly don't get the opportunity to hone their skills in a live environment - I think they managed to play a total of six shows in five years. But sometimes wanting to play is more important than ability. It's not fair to judge them in the same way as other metal bands. The fact that they exist at all is a triumph.</p> <p><strong>Heavy Metal in Baghdad </strong>is on limited release.

  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Thursday 18 December 2008</strong></p> <p> In September parents were given the opportunity to vote on proposals to turn Parkwood High School in Sheffield into an academy. In the week the ballot papers were sent out we published the article below in which we said that Edutrust, the sponsor of the proposed academy, is controlled by wealthy business people, many of them Muslims and that its first thought was to take over a mostly Muslim school. Edutrust objects to these statements. It says it is not a faith-based organisation and that its trustees have a diverse range of religious beliefs and backgrounds. Further, it denies that its first thought was to take over a mostly Muslim school. It says its main priority is to promote educational excellence and its trustees have made clear that academies sponsored by Edutrust will not be faith schools but will be open to students of all faiths and no faith. We did not approach Edutrust for comment before publication and we should have done. We should also have included a footnote to the article informing readers about the author's connections with the Anti Academies Alliance.</p> <p> </p> <p>This week a ballot paper will go to every family with one or more children at Parkwood high school in Sheffield, or at any of its three principal feeder primary schools. For the first time, parents are being asked whether they want their children's secondary school turned into one of the government's new academies.</p> <p>It was the newly elected Liberal Democrat council in Sheffield that inserted this democratic element into the very top-down academy system. Alasdair Smith, national coordinator of the Anti Academies Alliance, is delighted. \"We're keen for the chance to put over our arguments.\" But this experiment with democracy is not to be allowed to go too far. It's only a consultative ballot. If the vote goes against, the council reserves its right to turn the school into an academy anyway.</p> <p><strong>Loaded dice</strong></p> <p>The government is busy making sure the dice are loaded to prevent the first test of public opinion going against its flagship policy. Hence the strange case of the missing \u00a315m. That is the sum of money Parkwood will get if it becomes an academy. Will the school get the money if it doesn't become an academy? The council does not seem to know, and says we should ask the government. Local MP David Blunkett, in a three-page letter to an anti-academy parent, promises to argue for the \u00a315m if \"the overwhelming majority\" of parents are against the academy. But he makes his contempt for the anti-academy campaign clear. And he carefully leaves room for doubt as to whether the money would be available if parents were to embarrass New Labour by rejecting its flagship policy.</p> <p>One wonders whether the ballot might raise the eyebrows of UN observers, because only the council's information will go out with the ballot pack. So the North Sheffield Anti Academies Alliance is organising leafleting. And the council is making an effort to be fair. Its letter makes it clear that there are arguments against the academy proposal. It will organise an open public meeting at which all the arguments for and against academies can be put by anyone who wants to, and it will host a website at which people can post their views about academies and the Parkwood proposal. A spokeswoman pointed out that this was as far as the council could go: it is not allowed to give particular organisations special prominence.</p> <p>If the academy proposal goes ahead, Parkwood high school will in future be run by the sponsor, British Edutrust, which will have an inbuilt majority on the governing body and will take all the decisions that matter, including appointing the head and deciding the curriculum. British Edutrust has already appointed its head, should it gain control of the school: the man who has run the school for the past three years, Chris Mallaband. They say that under his leadership, Parkwood has \"demonstrated sustained progress, including improved exam results as well as a more positive and confident outlook from students about their achievements and learning\".</p> <p><strong>Successful school</strong></p> <p>This then is no failing school. Its results had a downturn this year, but before that they were going up steadily, and Mallaband is sure they will continue to rise, academy or no academy. So why go for an academy? Mallaband says it \"will help insulate us from failing in the future. We can get back on that upward curve faster.\" Local teacher Ben Morris of the anti-academy campaign says: \"One thing Parkwood hasn't had is stability. What it needs is for the local authority to give its teachers and parents support and long-term commitment, instead of shuffling it off on to a sponsor.\" </p> <p>Sheffield's existing two academies are sponsored by the Christian-controlled United Learning Trust, whose chief executive, Sir Ewan Harper, recently chilled the blood of rightwing policy wonks at the Policy Exchange thinktank in London with tales of how dreadful education was in Sheffield before ULT turned up. ULT appointed an overall chief executive, David Lewis, to run both schools, and made the heads report to him. This resulted in the departure of Andy Gardner, perhaps the most popular and respected head in the city. </p> <p>Mallaband is thought to have accepted British Edutrust with relief because it was not ULT, though all he will say is: \"Our governors made a careful and informed choice of sponsor.\" British Edutrust is new to the academy business and is controlled by wealthy business people, many of them Muslims. Its first thought seems to have been to take over a mostly Muslim school. It tried unsuccessfully for an overwhelmingly Muslim Bradford school, and then for Fir Vale in Sheffield, which is 90% Muslim. It has ended up bidding for Parkwood, with only about 20% Muslim students. </p> <p>The vote will have a significance far wider than Sheffield. Lord Adonis will certainly argue that a yes vote constitutes endorsement for a further massive expansion of the academies programme. Opponents will argue that similar ballots should be held whenever an academy is proposed.</p> <p>\u2022 Francis Beckett is the author of The Great Academy Fraud and has connections with the Anti Academies Alliance.</p>",
  "<p>If this is the death of Wall Street as we know it, the tombstone will read: killed by complexity.</p> <p>The complexity lies in modern markets' love affair with derivatives - the financial contracts sold to the world as a way to reduce risk. Got too many mortgages on your balance sheet? No problem, slice them up, package them, sell them on. Worried about your trading partner defaulting? Buy some insurance. The possibilities are almost endless.</p> <p>The gross value of outstanding derivatives is now counted in tens of trillions of dollars. A traditional backwater of the investment banking business has become a principal activity.</p> <p>The underlying philosophy behind derivatives sounds terrific. The weak can get rid of risks they can't handle and the financial system should be stronger as a result. In the right hands, derivatives can perform this role.</p> <p>But the general practice is very different, as the great investor Warren Buffett worked out years ago. His 2002 letter to his Berkshire Hathaway shareholders made headlines by condemning derivatives as \"financial weapons of mass destruction\". They were \"time bombs, both for the parties that deal in them and the economic system\".</p> <p>The passage comprised only a couple of pages of a lengthy letter but read it again today - it is the best guide to understanding how Wall Street has arrived at today's mess.</p> <p>Here is Buffett on General Re Securities, a derivatives dealer that Berkshire inherited with its purchase of insurer General Re. \"At year-end (after 10 months of winding down its operation) it had 14,384 contracts outstanding, involving 672 counterparties around the world. Each contract has a plus or minus value derived from one or more reference items, including some of mind-boggling complexity. Valuing a portfolio like that, expert auditors could easily and honestly have widely varying opinions.\"</p> <p>Now take a look at Lehman Brothers' balance sheet. On page 62 of last year's accounts, under the heading \"off balance sheet arrangements\" you will find a staggering figure. Lehman had derivative contracts with a face value of $738bn. The notes, fairly, make the point that the fair value is smaller than the notional amount - Lehman believed the figure was $36.8bn. Even so, \"mind-boggling complexity\" perfectly describes Lehman's accounts. How can you hope to sell such a business over a weekend? You can't, unless the state is willing to underwrite the risk. This time, the US Treasury said no.</p> <p><strong>Corporate meltdown</strong></p> <p>Complexity breeds other faults, as Buffett described. Derivatives, because they are so hard to value, make it easier for traders and chief executives to inflate earnings. They exacerbate problems if a company, for unrelated reasons, suffers a credit downgrade that requires it to post collateral with counterparties - \"a spiral that can lead to a corporate meltdown\", he wrote. They create a \"daisy chain\" of risk as the troubles of one company infect another because, ultimately, the value depends on the creditworthiness of the other party.</p> <p>Buffett made a gloomy prediction half a decade ago. \"The derivatives genie is now well out of the bottle, and these instruments will almost certainly multiply in variety and number until some event makes their toxicity clear,\" he said. \"Central banks and governments have so far found no effective way to control, or even monitor, the risks posed by these contracts.\"</p> <p>That event has duly arrived. Lehman Brothers has declared bankruptcy. Merrill Lynch has rushed into the arms of Bank of America to avoid the daisy chain of risk. The fate of AIG, once America's biggest insurer, lies in the hands of the Fed - the company has been caught by the fear that it will have to post collateral, the spiral Buffett described.</p> <p>Unwinding a big derivatives book is no easy task - like Hell, derivatives are easy to enter and impossible to exit, said Buffett. That is why the failure of a firm the size of Lehman, Wall Street's fourth largest investment bank, presents such a risk to the financial system - we don't know how many other firms will be brought down as the body is extracted from the financial web. </p> <p>Hedge funds can be heard complaining that they don't know what will happen to trades they executed with Lehman last week.</p> <p>Financial regulators have huffed and puffed for years about the possible dangers posed by derivatives. Timothy Geithner, the Fed's man in New York and the official who chaired the weekend crisis summit on Lehman, wondered a couple of years ago whether their use might make financial crises less common, but more severe. He was right about the second bit.</p> <p>There are, of course, many other contributors to the current financial crisis - years of cheap money, a housing bubble, and so on. But derivatives have helped to inflate these pressures because they have grown without proper rules on disclosure. They have allowed junk to accumulate in the system.</p> <p>But financial regulators must now know what must happen in the long term. It's time for them to force better disclosure. They didn't last time, when hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management collapsed in 1998. This time really has to be different.</p>",
  "<p>Manic Monday began soon after midnight in New York, five am in London. Lehman Brothers was formally bankrupt: the papers had been filed and the long list of unsecured creditors lodged. The world was about to discover what happens when a proud 158-year-old financial institution, with 25,000 staff and tentacles that reach into the heart of the world's financial system, collapses.</p> <p>The market's reaction would be bad, but would it be panic or would investors take comfort that the financial authorities and Wall Street's survivors were throwing around vast sums of capital? Overnight, 10 big banks had found $70bn (\u00a339.1bn) to place into a pool to ease financial pressures. The US Federal Reserve had said it would relax its lending terms.</p> <p>One of London's most experienced fund managers was prepared for the worst. Robert Talbut, chief investment officer at Royal London Asset Management, said: \"The shock was because ultimately nobody believed that the US authorities would pull the plug on Lehman. People felt confident that when push came to shove something would happen and a rescue would be arranged\".</p> <p><strong>Early reaction</strong></p> <p>The market's first response was encouraging. When trading started in London, the FTSE 100 index fell 160 points: a big tumble on a normal day, a modest fall in these exceptional circumstances.</p> <p>There were grounds for optimism. Four big US institutions, with their share prices collapsing, had entered the emergency ward last Friday but only Lehman was dead. Merrill Lynch had even found a saviour. Bank of America (BoA), having abandoned thoughts of rescuing Lehman, swooped on Sunday afternoon to buy the broking firm which, for many Americans, is the public face of the financial system. Merrill has offices across America. The company's giant charging bull is the most photographed landmark on Wall Street. If Merrill fell, confidence would drain away.</p> <p>Why had Ken Lewis, BoA's boss, agreed to pay $50bn for Merrill? Hadn't he said in October that he had had \"all the fun I can stand\" in investment banking? Was his arm being twisted by the Fed?</p> <p>For now, explanations didn't matter - despite rumours yesterday that a run on Merrill had begun in the US late on Friday. BoA had guaranteed that Wall Street's next big domino would not fall.</p> <p>That left two patients, AIG, once the world's biggest insurer, and Washington Mutual, a big savings and loans business. Signals were mixed. AIG had walked away from talks with three big private equity houses who were offering up to $20bn to shore up the balance sheet. Instead, it was turning to the Fed for support. </p> <p>Was that well-placed confidence on AIG's part, or a foolhardy attempt to ride out the storm? Wall Street would deliver its verdict when markets opened at 2.30pm London time. Worries about Washington Mutual, where rescue rumours had become worryingly cold, would also have to wait.</p> <p>London had its own worries. Shares in HBOS, the country's biggest mortgage lender, were plunging. At midday, the price hit 180p, a fall of 36% on the day. Behind the scenes, HBOS officials were desperately appealing for calm. The bank, they argued, had raised \u00a34bn from shareholders in June at 275p a share and didn't need fresh funds. The FTSE 100 was now down almost 300 points - optimism was fading and the prospect of another Black Monday was coming into view.</p> <p>Across the City, traders were being reminded of how difficult it is to unscramble a business such as Lehman, a firm with hundreds of billions of dollars tied up in derivative contracts. The Financial Services Authority demanded precise updates from banks, building societies, insurance companies and fund management firms of their exposures to Lehman. It is thought to have been assured that the exposure of banking groups was \"manageable\".</p> <p>By now, Lehman's list of unsecured creditors had been posted to financial websites. The surprise was the number of Japanese banks on the list - Aozora, which is actually controlled by US private equity firm Cerberus, is owed $463m. It immediately tried to calm investors' fears by saying its actual exposure was lower thanks to hedging positions. But the rollcall of Japanese names went on. Mizuho has an outstanding loan of $289m; Shinsei a claim of $231m; UFJ Bank has$185m; and Sumitomo Mitsubishi has $177m. The credit crisis had arrived in Japan and the country's financial regulator ordered Lehman's local subsidiary to retain assets in the country. The messy unravelling of Wall Street's fourth biggest investment bank had become messier and likely to become more troublesome during the day ahead as Tokyo shares started to trade after Monday's public holiday. Could this be where the next bombshell will explode?</p> <p>Back at Lehman staff were logging on to the reality of financial failure. \"No trades or other transactions may be entered into by members of staff today without prior clearance from a member of Europe and Middle East operating committee,\" said an email from management. There was also an admission that salaries due on Friday were unlikely to be paid.</p> <p>By the time US stock markets opened, London had recovered slightly. The FTSE 100 was down 225 points and HBOS's shares were back above 200p. Now the talk was about how much medicine the US Fed would inject in the form of interest rates cuts; Merrill Lynch's analysts said they expect the Fed to cut by half a percentage point today, taking US interest rates down to 1.5%. The Dow Jones industrial average opened about 300 points lower, almost 100 points better than the futures market had been predicting a couple of hours earlier.</p> <p>But the fall in AIG's shares was as severe as feared. The stock halved in value and analysts were calculating the odds on AIG's survival. \"We believe AIG will survive, but we have little indication of how many business lines will ultimately need to be sold and how dilutive to shareholders' future capital raising efforts will be,\" said Citigroup.</p> <p>AIG, it was revealed, had approached the Fed to borrow $40bn, a colossal sum and an indication of the size of the potential derivatives bomb within the insurer's balance sheet. It needed the cash to avoid a potentially damaging downgrade of its credit rating. A downgrade would oblige the company to post $18bn of collateral to back various financial guarantees to counter-parties. AIG, in approaching the Fed, was attempting to buy time to sell assets and avoid a classic downward spiral.</p> <p><strong>Special treatment</strong></p> <p>It was not clear that the Fed would grant such a huge loan. Having refused to support Lehman, why should it give special treatment to AIG? The insurer had refused to accept a private equity offer to take effective control of the business. AIG was now the market's number one worry. At Bank of America, Lewis' apparent act of generosity towards Merrill Lynch was being punished by the market. BoA's shares fell 15% and Lewis was obliged to defend the timing of the takeover and the decision to pay 70% more than Merrill's share price last Friday. </p> <p>\"We thought the long-term benefits were so overwhelming. It was such a strategic opportunity that we elected not to roll the dice and to go ahead and do it at this time,\" he said in a conference call. \"I don't know anybody who's perfect at picking the absolute bottom.\"</p> <p>At 4.30pm, the FTSE 100 closed down 212 points - a very bad day, but substantially better than feared. Nick Parsons, head of markets strategy at NAB Capital, said: \"It's not even one of the top big day declines. We've seen movements on this scale before.\" A markets watcher with 25 years experience, Parsons nonetheless warned that this was only day one of the fallout.</p> <p>An hour after the London close, the market started to get its answer on AIG. The US authorities appeared to be allowing it to prop itself up by allowing it to grant itself bridging loans to get through the immediate current crisis. For the time being at least, AIG seemed less likely to collapse.</p> <p>Such concerns about the financial viability of all major dealers was the main focus in the markets yesterday. Every financial firm was measuring its exposure to every counterparty. \"Everyone is looking at what their exposure is to everybody else. Then ... you ask yourself, 'am I happy with that degree of exposure to those particular names,'\" said Talbut. The answer to that question may not be known for days. </p> <p>This story will be continued.</p>",
  "<p>Education is an engine of social justice, perhaps the most powerful tool we have. As a society, we have a duty to seek out and nurture the talent of our young people irrespective of their social background, and the same must apply to our educational institutions.</p> <p>Of course universities and colleges cannot be expected to compensate for all the difficulties young people may have faced. But every time we fail to provide access to further or higher education for an able and hard-working young adult, we all lose. Universities lose a successful student; the economy loses a talented worker and the young person loses a lifetime of opportunity. </p> <p>We are winning this argument and, while there is much still to be done, the culture is changing - universities are undertaking a wide range of activities to raise aspirations and overcome barriers to higher education. </p> <p>The arguments about widening participation are familiar to those on the left, but what is less often discussed is that education as a force for social change must include all aspects of adult education, including basic skills training. This vision was one of the driving forces behind the creation of my department last year, and is central to so much that Dius (Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills) is seeking to achieve. </p> <p>Fundamentally, this is an argument about fairness. Of course fairness means giving all young people with talent an opportunity to go to university or further education, whatever their background. But fairness also demands that we give a second chance to those who were failed by the education system the first time round, for their own sake and for the sake of their children. </p> <p>This understanding marks this government out from its predecessors. Children's policy and redistribution are hugely important tools for fostering social mobility, but will, on their own, never be enough to break the cycle of poverty and low attainment being passed on from one generation to another. Schools cannot, on their own, erase generations of low expectations and limited achievement.</p> <p>When we took office, we inherited a legacy of very poor skills with over 7 million adults unable to read or write. Successive Conservative governments effectively wrote these people off, despite the cost to them as individuals and the damage to our overall prosperity. </p> <p>This was not just hugely wasteful but completely unnecessary. The evidence of the impact on life chances of improving people's basic skills is compelling. With level 2 qualifications or above you are twice as likely to earn more than \u00a320,000 a year, while the majority of people without adequate literacy never receive a promotion (75% of women and 63% of men). </p> <p>Improving literacy and numeracy also improves health and happiness. If you have good basic skills you are more likely to own your own home (78% of people with good literacy compared to 40% without); you are less likely to smoke and drink too much and you are more likely to be satisfied with your life (78% of men with good literacy versus 50% without).</p> <p>Raising the skills levels of parents means raising their aspirations, not just for themselves but also for their children. Young children whose parents have even basic literacy do 63% better than those without. In real terms, this can mean something as simple as being able to read your child a bedtime story.</p> <p>This is why the Conservatives' attempts to steal Labour's mantle as the party of fairness will not stand up to scrutiny. They believe in higher education for their own children, but they think that too many of other people's children go to university. </p> <p>And they want to return to a situation in which those adults who have not been well served by the education system receive no helping hand from government. They have said that they will abolish Train to Gain, the workplace training that tackles basic skills needs and provides level 2 and level 3 qualifications. This would cut \u00a31bn in 2010-11 alone from the drive to help people get on in their lives and it would hit people hard: 43% of Train to Gain workers report getting a pay rise, and 30% a promotion.</p> <p>The Conservatives would not only cut student numbers, but also cut student funding per head and investment in skills. But they would spend \u00a31bn on a cut in inheritance tax. It is hard to see how a party that is committed to spend that money on 3,000 relatively well-off families, while cutting funding from those most in need of government help, can make any claim to fairness or can have any credibility when it comes to a commitment to tackle social mobility.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Denham is secretary of state for Innovation, Universities and Skills</p>",
  "<p>Mike Ashley's claims that he inherited a financial mess at Newcastle United and possibly saved the club from going bust have been rubbished by Freddy Shepherd. Newcastle's former chairman last night defended his regime and said he had left all departments in good shape.</p> <p>Ashley is seeking to sell the club a year after buying out the Hall family along with Shepherd, who had a smaller stake. He claimed on Sunday that without him Newcastle \"might not have survived\". But Shepherd said the sports retailer, who had opted against due diligence, had purchased a club equipped for prosperity.</p> <p>\"It's absolutely ridiculous; everything was covered,\" Shepherd said. \"But what Ashley didn't realise was that he had to pay off the mortgage on the stadium. If the Halls lost control, that debt had to be paid immediately. The largest part of the debt was the stadium and I think he had to pay around \u00a357m.</p> <p>\"To build that stadium now would cost \u00a3450m. Newcastle were in good shape when I left. There was no way the club was going anywhere but upwards.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless Newcastle still owe about \u00a327m in instalments on transfer fees negotiated under Shepherd. \"Yes, they are still paying off the tail end of Owen's deal and possibly one or two others, but we're not the first to have done that,\" he said. \"It's not unusual. We'll stand by our record, the Halls and the Shepherds. We built a great stadium, we built a great training ground. We left all the tools there and a good set of players. Everything was there. We've nothing to be ashamed of.</p> <p>\"We were always looking at ways to expand the business and increase turnover.

It has now been proved not a lot of people can run them.\" And he said Ashley, while seeking a buyer, should reinstate Kevin Keegan as manager.</p>",
  "<p>Newcastle United's Danny Guthrie may have his ban extended by the Football Association for the tackle that left the Hull City striker Craig Fagan with a broken leg and facing more than three months on the sidelines.</p> <p>Phil Brown, the Hull manager, has condemned the tackle and hopes the FA will explore ways of imposing further sanctions on Guthrie, arguing that there should be a deterrent against such recklessness. \"I think a red card and a three-game ban is insufficient,\" he said. \"He has put a fellow player into a cast for a minimum of six weeks and possibly three months.\"</p> <p>The FA confirmed that it was examining whether an extension to Guthrie's automatic three-game ban was appropriate. \"We are looking at the incident,\" said a spokesman, \"and have the right to alter the suspension if necessary.\"</p> <p>Guthrie was sent off in the 90th minute after running several yards to first kick out at and then scythe Fagan down as he shielded the ball by the touchline. At no point did the 21-year-old look as if he was attempting to win possession. Although Fagan got to his feet after the second lunge during Hull's 2-1 win at St James' Park on Saturday, x-rays later revealed a fractured right tibia.</p> <p>Guthrie apologised to the striker last night, claiming the challenge was \"totally out of character\" and born of \"frustration\", but Brown remains unimpressed. \"It was a direct result of a reckless and callous challenge from a player obviously affected by the situation that's going on at Newcastle and decided to take the law into his own hands,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Celebrities are a ceaselessly inventive breed when it comes to marking themselves out from the herd. Welcome to the world of white tattooing.</p> <p>A white tattoo does exactly what it says on the electric ink-dispensing gun. Unpigmented powder and alcohol are mixed together and injected under the skin. Lindsay Lohan has one saying \"Breathe\" on the inside of her wrist, Kate Moss is rumoured to have hearts running up one side of her body and now Jasmine Lennard, US reality TV star, has had \"amore appassionato\" scrawled on her wrist. </p> <p>How is it done? With difficulty, apparently. \"Because it's a very weak pigment, you have to penetrate the skin quite heavily,\" says the owner of the Fulham Tattoo Centre Terry MacLaren, a tattooist with 30 years' experience. Once the scabs have fallen off, the results look exactly as you might expect - as if you've been branded by a Wyoming cowboy or have self-mutilated with a really steady hand. </p> <p>It is easy to see the attraction of white tats for celebrities. Their lack of visibility suggests a level of sophistication and exclusivity that sliding knickerless out of limousines cannot convey, and they can be easily covered with makeup when a period or Disney role hoves into view. Also, celebrities are idiots.</p> <p>The attraction for ordinary people is less obvious. \"They never look good,\" says MacLaren. \"They always look like scar tissue, especially at the beginning when the blood coming through makes them look pinkish. After that, they just look faded and weak.\" </p> <p>It appears then that the modern celebrity has gone through the looking glass. An initial bloom of fresh blood, a half-hearted branding that leaves only a pale and rapidly fading outline behind. These people are carving metaphors for their lives into their own flesh. </p>",
  "<p>Desmond Tutu, the South African Nobel laureate, said yesterday there was a \"possibility\" Israel had committed a war crime when 18 Palestinians from a single family were killed by Israeli artillery shells in Gaza two years ago.</p> <p>Tutu said the Israeli attack, which hit the Athamna family house, showed \"a disproportionate and reckless disregard for Palestinian civilian life\". </p> <p>The archbishop presented his comments in a final report to the UN Human Rights Council, which had sent him to Gaza to investigate the killings in Beit Hanoun in November 2006. For 18 months Israel did not grant the archbishop or his team a visa. They entered Gaza in May this year on a rare crossing from Egypt. </p> <p>On the three-day visit, Tutu and his team visited the house, interviewed the survivors and met others in Gaza, including the senior Hamas figure and former prime minister, Ismail Haniyeh. At the time, Tutu said he wanted to travel to Israel to hear the Israeli account of events, but he was not permitted.</p> <p>\"In the absence of a well-founded explanation from the Israeli military - which is in sole possession of the relevant facts - the mission must conclude that there is a possibility that the shelling of Beit Hanoun constituted a war crime,\" Tutu said in his report to the 47-member council.</p> <p>Tutu also said that rockets fired by Palestinian militants into southern Israel should stop and should be investigated. \"Those firing rockets on Israeli civilians are no less accountable than the Israeli military for their actions,\" he said.</p> <p>For the past three months a ceasefire between Israel and the militant groups in Gaza has been in place. It has significantly reduced the number of incidents and the death toll from the conflict there. Israel maintains a tough economic blockade on the territory, restricting imports and banning nearly all exports.</p> <p>\"It is not too late for an independent, impartial and transparent investigation of the shelling to be held,\" Tutu said. </p> <p>He said those responsible for firing the shells should be held accountable, whether the cause of the incident was a mistake or wilful.</p> <p>After the incident, Israel's military said the shelling into Beit Hanoun that day was a mistake and was the result of a \"rare and severe failure in the artillery fire-control system\" which created \"incorrect range-findings\". It said the shells had been aimed 450 metres away from the edge of town. No legal action was taken against any officer. However, it is unclear why the artillery was fired so close to a residential area that morning and why shells continued to be fired after the first one hit the Athamna house.</p> <p>Tutu also said he recommended that Israel pay adequate compensation to the victims \"without delay\". His report said \"reparation\" should also be made to the town of Beit Hanoun itself, and suggested a memorial to the victims would also help the survivors. He suggested a physiotheraphy clinic as one possibility.</p> <p>The survivors in the family remain bitter and most of the large extended family no longer live in the building. Since the shelling they have received no financial help, apart from a monthly stipend from the Palestinian Authority of \u00a350 for each of the 18 dead.</p> <p>Aharon Leshno-Yaar, Israel's ambassador to the UN in Geneva, where the Human Rights Council was meeting, rejected Tutu's report as \"another regrettable product of the Human Rights Council\". </p> <p>\"It is regrettable that this mission took place at all,\" he added. </p> <p>Leshno-Yaar said the report gave de facto legitimacy to Hamas, the Islamist movement that won elections in 2006 and then seized full control of Gaza last year. \"This does not serve the interests of Israel or the Palestinians or the cause of peace,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Thabo Mbeki has got his deal in Zimbabwe, although too late, probably, to save his own skin in South Africa. Robert Mugabe retains the presidency and control over the army, and Morgan Tsvangirai, the man who bears the physical scars of his regime, has at last got executive power as prime minister. Will any of this work? As the opposition senator David Coltart said, the deal signed yesterday means that virtually all of the cabinet members nominated by the two factions of the Movement for Democratic Change have now to sit down with the very people who ordered them to be brutalised.</p> <p>For those seeking justice for the hundreds killed, the thousands injured, and the tens of thousands who have lost their homes, this was always going to be hard to swallow. Mr Mugabe has got away with murder, at least for the time being. But if the two factions of the MDC can work together - and that is a big if - the former liberation fighter turned autocrat will still have lost, and lost disastrously.</p> <p>He retains the army, but the generals will abide by the constitution. The MDC gains control of the police, which is vital if elections are to be held in two years time. No one is in any doubt that if free elections were held, Zanu-PF would be wiped off the map. The issue is what happens between now and then. Zanu-PF are expected to retain control of the prisons and the prosecuting authorities. They fear that prosecutors, unleashed from their control, would do to them what they did to the MDC. But that still leaves the MDC not only with finance (they will be the conduit of the foreign aid package) but also the ministries which spend money, like health and education.</p> <p>This puts the former opposition movement into a position where power and influence will naturally flow to them. They will be the ones distributing food and relief to the hardest hit rural areas. No longer will Zanu-PF be able to starve villagers into submission. That, in itself, is change.</p> <p>There is much that can sour. Mr Mugabe's power lies in his ability to exploit the personality differences between the two factions of the MDC. Everyone remembers what his close embrace did to Joshua Nkomo's Zapu. But this is a power which the MDC can resist, if they set about the business of government collectively. As the MDC's power grows, life will become progressively more difficult for hardliners in Zanu-PF who face the threat of a free press and private prosecutions. That is the optimistic scenario. But it still remains the case that this settlement is the MDC's to wreck. They have the support of the people, control of the coffers, and the confidence of foreign governments. The question is whether they can deliver.</p>",
  "<p>After claiming to have spent nine years nurturing democracy in Pakistan and festooning the country's military dictatorship with $11bn in aid, the Bush administration's policy is careering out of control, as US soldiers trade bullets with the forces of what was once a most-favoured ally in the \"war on terror\". On Sunday night, Pakistan border troops fired on a raiding party of American commandos emerging from two Chinooks in an attempt to cross on foot from Afghanistan into the Pakistan village of Angoor Adda. They had no permission to be there.</p> <p>This was the latest in a series of forays into Pakistan sovereign territory taken by US special forces at the behest of President Bush. In July he signed an executive order to sidestep Pakistan's freely elected government in the rush to claim al-Qaida scalps - especially Osama bin Laden's. In the past six weeks, US missiles have rained down on Pakistani villages, with Predator drones lighting up the country's tribal belt and hunter-killer teams dropping into Pakistan's villages in the dead of night.</p> <p>All good timing for the Republicans: these red-blooded offensives play well in America's heartlands; the ailing Bush and his party have been re-branded, Rambo-style, as sidestepping an untrustworthy ally to take the fight directly to the terrorists. However, it is spectacularly bad timing for Pakistan, the raids commencing just three days before Asif Ali Zardari was sworn in as president. During his inaugural speech in Islamabad on September 6, more than 30 civilians were killed by a suicide bombing in Peshawar as the local population vented its anger at the incursions.</p> <p>Zardari has used a family trip to Britain to gain an urgent sit-down with Gordon Brown. Yesterday he flew in to see off his oldest daughter, Bakhtawar, 18, who is studying English literature at Edinburgh University. Today in Downing Street, Zardari will warn the prime minister that the latest twist in the war on terror will \"only lead to greater disaster, more hatred, more alienation, more ghettos, more recruits, and more violence\". Without Britain's help in holding back the US, buying the new Pakistan government breathing space, anti-American sentiment will wash over the country; Zardari and his Pakistan People's party coalition will be unable to stop it spiralling out of control.</p> <p>If it sounds like blackmail, with Zardari bargaining by placing a gun to his own head - an age-old diplomatic tactic of Pakistan leaders - consider the evidence. Pakistan is in the grip of Islamist-driven chaos with the white pennants of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the country's home-grown medievalists, flying from government offices across North and South Waziristan. North-West Frontier Province, its once cosmopolitan capital of Peshawar and its former ski resorts in the Swat valley, have been encircled by the movement's Vice and Virtue Brigades. The strategically vital province of Baluchistan is simmering; and the economic engine of Karachi is witnessing an explosion of violence.</p> <p>Zardari does not convince everyone, given the welter of corruption charges that once circled him, but he is not the only one worried. The fears of the normally silent Pakistan armed forces were reflected this weekend in an extraordinary article by Lieutenant General Shahid Aziz, who served as the chief of general staff under Zardari's predecessor, Pervez Musharraf. Gen Aziz accused Musharraf of inviting the Americans to fight their war on Pakistani territory, without consulting the army: \"Militants will multiply by the thousands,\" he warned. \"The Pakistani army will not be able to support US operations. Financial crisis and street unrest will create chaos in the country and war will spread.\"</p> <p>Today Gordon Brown will be asked to put his faith in Zardari, an acquisitive man once reviled in this country and his own as \"Mr 10%\". Days after the assassination of his wife, Benazir Bhutto, Zardari produced a handwritten will; and now he has resurrected a series of radical measures drafted by Benazir shortly before her death. The documents make for compelling reading: \"The enemy the west has identified [a handful of al-Qaida and Taliban leaders] is the wrong target. The concern of the developed world is motivated entirely by a single consideration - its own safety. You cannot wage wars against ideas. Fight them with different means.\"</p> <p>One of these - already shown to the foreign secretary, David Miliband - is the formation of an intergovernmental counter-terrorist body. Its happy-clappy working title, United Against Terrorism, belies a serious ambition. Zardari will call for all of Pakistan's regional neighbours or mentors - Russia, China, Afghanistan, Iran and India among them - to sit together and think through the crises. The US and the UK would also be present but in the background. \"A consensus is necessary so the war on terror is not considered an American war but is owned by all countries,\" the paper concludes. Not only would such a move distance Washington from Islamabad, it would also feed into the counter-insurgency strategy for Pakistan's border areas that Zardari will also be revealing today in Downing Street.</p> <p>Referred to by his aides as a new Marshall plan, it calls for an international consortium led by the UK to reconstruct Pakistan's tribal areas, unravelling extremist infrastructure that grew massively during the Musharraf years - when more than a dozen proscribed terrorist organisations were allowed to regroup under new names, and pro-jihad madrasas trebled to 13,000. Zardari proposes a reconstruction budget to revitalise everything from local transport to water supplies. His aides have drawn up employment schemes and proposed wholesale reforms of partisan local police and local government. The families of those who die in the struggle against extremism are to be paid compensation, and those who are injured will have their medical costs covered.</p> <p>Finally, Zardari is offering to establish a special intelligence cell at the Pakistan High Commission in London, which will act as a storehouse for information about Islamists and terror threats, tracking British Pakistanis as they make their way from the UK to Pakistan - a concrete boon to British counter-terrorism officials, who recently revealed that eight out of 10 current investigations in the UK have a close connection to Pakistan. Given the spectacular collapse of the airline bomb plot trial this month, this cell might tip the balance in Zardari's favour. \"We all want fewer blunders,\" Wajid Shamsul Hasan, Pakistan's high commissioner in London, said.</p> <p>In a notoriously difficult foreign policy arena, injected with precious few new ideas, there are signs that Brown is ready to take Zardari seriously. The Foreign Office has already played a vigorous and little known role in getting Zardari elected president: Sir Mark Lyall Grant, the FCO political director, used his offices to elegantly strong-arm Pakistani political factions exiled to the UK into voting for the PPP's presidential candidate. In a daring move, the MQM party, which has offices in north London - and was set against the PPP - was talked into becoming temporary champion of a PPP machine it had previously only bombed and shot at.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Adrian Levy and Cathy Scott-Clark are the authors of Deception: Pakistan, the United States and the Global Nuclear Weapons Conspiracy</p>",
  "<p>It's barely autumn, but now's the time early applicants have to get their act together for university entry in 2009. Among these are all those considering either Oxford or Cambridge - you can only apply to one or the other. Ucas must receive your completed application by October 15, so if you're applying through a school or college there will be an even earlier deadline than this, probably later this month.</p> <p>What are the pros and cons of Oxbridge? What are they actually like? And what are they looking for in you?</p> <p>If it's an intellectually stimulating, unique and intense learning environment you're hoping for, Oxbridge may be for you. The tutorial or supervision system, alongside lectures and seminars, allows individual attention and teaching. And this is likely to be with experts in their field. The college system should provide a small, friendly and supportive environment in which to live and study. There will be plenty of social opportunities, clubs and societies and, at the end of it all, excellent career possibilities. Sounds a no-brainer? Not exactly. You do need to analyse exactly what it is you want from your higher education experience - reputation and status are fine, but there are other, more personal considerations. </p> <p>First, your predicted grades will almost certainly have to be AAA or very close - 99.8% of successful applicants at Oxford go on to achieve A-level scores of AAB or better. Next, is your chosen course offered? Even if it is, look very carefully at content - is it what you want? Teaching and learning styles are important. Will they suit you? Familiarise yourself with the Tripos system - courses divided into blocks lasting one or two years - if Cambridge is your aim.</p> <p>A feature of Oxbridge is the collegiate system. With over 30 at each, how do you choose? The advice from both is not to worry too much about this, although you should consider location, size and age of college and facilities. Make a shortlist. An open application may be a good idea if, after research, you really don't mind where you go. Check whether there are any extra admissions tests for your subject, too.</p> <p>What happens after you've applied? Most suitably qualified students will get an interview, indeed usually more than one, in December. Before then you may have to submit extra work. Decisions will be transmitted to you late December/early January, occasionally later if you have been pooled. This means that although your first-choice college is not accepting you, your details have been passed onto other colleges that may.</p> <p>What are your chances? Both universities say that if your exam predictions are good, then your chance of being admitted is around one in four.</p> <p>Some miscellaneous stats and facts:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> There are over 20,000 students at Oxford; Cambridge has 17,000-plus.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Oxford has one of the lowest drop-out rates in the UK: only 1.2% of students discontinued their course, compared with the national rate of 8.6%.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Oxford graduates' employment rate is over 95%; the UK average is 93.8%. Last year over 96% of Cambridge graduates found jobs or entered further study within six months.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Oxbridge undergraduates enter a wide range of occupations, with over 75% in managerial and professional posts.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Over 45% of students go on to further study, compared with a national average of just 23%.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The number of undergraduate applications to Oxford has more than doubled in the past 30 years, from 6,300 in 1976 to 13,639 in 2006. Cambridge received over 14,000 applications for 4,000 places in 2007.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Over 3,000 state-school students are likely to enter Oxbridge in 2009.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Both universities have generous bursary schemes.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The special Oxbridge application forms have been abolished this year.</p> <p>What every intending Oxbridge applicant must remember is that this is just one choice out of five and equal time (arguably more, given the stats) should be spent on the other four choices. Often, because the application is so early, not enough thought goes into this.</p> <p>A note for new year 12s: make sure you have chosen the right location and the right combinations of courses for your A-levels. Obvious as this may sound, it is not unusual for students to make ill-informed choices on both counts. If this is the case, address the issue now rather than later.</p> <p><strong>Next time:</strong> the other early applicants: medics, dentists and vets.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Beckett is higher education adviser at City &amp; Islington Sixth-Form College</p>",
  "<p>It is quite clear that the government's radical rebalancing of budgets for further education and skills just is not working. Reports of underspending of well over \u00a31m on Train to Gain sit alongside cuts in excess of 1,400,000 adult places on Learning and Skills Council programmes. Then there are the published plans that will add another half a billion pounds to Train to Gain and cut freely chosen FE provision by 72% by 2011. </p> <p>Something has to give. Conservative proposals to put \u00a3100m extra into adult and community learning through colleges, in the belief that people can be trusted to make their own choices about learning, would be a good start. </p> <p>What else would make a difference? My shopping list would begin with re-balancing the Skills for Life strategy, to give priority to those people with literacy and numeracy skills below entry level 2. This is where education for adults can make most difference in breaking the cycle of intergenerational poverty and underperformance. </p> <p>Next, I would remove the cap on investment in English for speakers of other languages (Esol). Again, rebalancing is needed to meet the greatest need, which is more courses for complete beginners. I would reverse, too, the refusal to offer English to new asylum-seekers for their first six months.</p> <p>Then there is the unitisation of the post-school curriculum. We need it desperately if adults are to have real chances to fit learning in alongside the other pressures on their lives. For unitisation to work we need two more changes - first, an end to the nonsense of only funding full qualifications; second, a foundation learning tier that recognises the breadth of adults' studies. We need a system as good at starting from learners' curiosity as it is in meeting employers' needs, and the foundation learning tier is where those two meet.</p> <p>Adults would benefit if our planning and funding system recognised the differences between Canary Wharf and Cannock Chase. It is understandable for the government to make sure that most cash committed to FE and skills is directed to national priorities. But a touch of humility about what works would be welcome. A balance of 80% of funding determined centrally, leaving 20% to local discretion, would allow providers to respond to local circumstances.</p> <p>There is a powerful need to help people with a learning MOT in mid-career, particularly since the likelihood of extended working lives looms ever larger. An entitlement to a skills health check at 45 for all adults would focus attention on the need for learning through the life-cycle. It would need to be supplemented with a change to the rules of both Train to Gain and higher education funding, to allow people to take a second level 2, 3 or 4 qualification with public support once 10 years had elapsed since the first qualification.</p> <p>In the workplace, the government needs to announce a date when each sector will introduce licences to practice, requiring employers to train staff. If we think learning at work is a key to economic success, we need to make it compulsory for all employers to join in.</p> <p>Then for older people and families there should be a modest entitlement to learning; an end to the embargo on short courses, and regular monitoring to see which groups are underrepresented. Finally, we need a national outreach service to encourage those groups to participate. Taken together, these measures would doubtless more than use up the Train to Gain underspend, but would surely kick-start the learning society that everyone agrees is the surest route to future prosperity and to a society worth living in.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Alan Tuckett is the director of the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education</p>",
  "<p>The Iraqi government is in danger of pushing Sunni tribal leaders back into the arms of al-Qaida and re-igniting major violence across Iraq if it fails to take more Sunnis into the security forces, the country's leading Sunni politician has warned.</p> <p>Many tribal leaders who opposed the US occupation switched sides on promises of jobs in the previously Shia-dominated army and police. In a sign of the success of the so-called Awakening movement (al Sahwa), which is also known as the \"Sons of Iraq\", the US recently handed Anbar province - once a centre of the insurgency - back to Iraqi control. </p> <p>But in Diyala province, north of the capital, as well as in Baghdad suburbs, the Iraqi army and police have arrested dozens of al-Sahwa leaders in recent weeks because of their previous anti-American and anti-government activity. The government is dragging its feet on a pledge to take a fifth of the estimated 100,000 al-Sahwa members into the security forces. </p> <p>Iraq's vice-president, Tariq al-Hashimi, who heads the Iraqi Islamic party, said: \"The government is very hesitant, and I'm afraid if those groups and individuals are frustrated they might change their minds and instead of fighting al-Qaida and terrorism they will be back to offering them a safe haven, as they did in the past. This is a dangerous development. </p> <p>\"The Awakening groups have become genuine partners in tackling terrorism in Iraq and they should be rewarded rather than penalised,\" he said.</p> <p>His concerns were strongly echoed by Sheikh Mustafa Kamil Hamed, a leader of the powerful Jibouri tribe, who controls about 3,500 men in al-Doura, an area of farms and small towns east of Baghdad. Sporting a pistol and a leather belt of bullets across his white jalabiya, his story typifies the extraordinary zigzag of many Iraqi Sunnis. Once a resistance leader, he now proudly displays a medal from George Bush and boasts of entertaining General David Petraeus, the US commander in Iraq, at his headquarters, a small compound surrounded by blast walls and concrete watchtowers.</p> <p>Al-Qaida arrived in al-Doura in 2005, he said, kidnapping government employees, taking hostages, putting up fake checkpoints, and killing Shias. \"Al-Qaida pushed us hard to work with them. They even killed my brother's two sons. We said to them, 'If you've come to resist the US occupation, Iraq is an open field. You're free to do what you want but don't come here and kill our people,'\" the sheikh said.</p> <p>Gradually, he and his tribal colleagues decided to band together and resist al Qaida. The trend was replicated in other Sunni areas. The Americans saw what was happening and gave the Awakening movement money and other support. Now al Doura is crisscrossed with al-Sahwa and Iraqi army checkpoints. Displaced Shia families started to come home. But the mood in al-Doura changed last month with the arrest by the Iraqi army of two prominent al-Sahwa leaders.</p> <p>In Adhamiya, once of the most dangerous Sunni districts of Baghdad, the story is similar. Abu Abed Ali Bahjat has 400 al-Sahwa men under arms since he began to resist al-Qaida. They refuse to let Iraqi army and police, or US forces, into the suburb's rubble-strewn streets. Adhamiya was one of the worst areas during Baghdad's sectarian battles. Now Shia families are returning there too - around 300, according to Abu Abed, or roughly 60% of those who fled. </p> <p>Like Kamil Hamed, he is angry with the Shia-led government's apparent switch against al-Sahwa, blaming it on Iranian influence. </p> <p>Some Sunni leaders claim the prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, wants al-Sahwa disbanded by the end of the year. Gen Petraeus and other US officials have expressed guarded criticism of the delay in taking the promised 20,000 al-Sahwa members into the security forces, as they try to strike a balance between not undermining Maliki while assuring Sunnis.</p> <p>Kamil Hamed suspects the US supports the clampdown on al-Sahwa, whatever US officials say publicly. \"US forces are playing a cat-and-mouse game,\" he said. \"They cannot support al-Sahwa on the one hand and let the government arrest al-Sahwa leaders on the other. We restored security in this area but now are under threat. My personal feeling is the US has a special agenda to demolish al-Sahwa. We don't think the US cares.\"</p>",
  "<p>The treatment rooms are lined to ensure that no one queuing at the checkouts can hear the dentist's drill. But the convenience of dropping in for a filling while doing the groceries was a winning combination for shoppers at Sainsbury's in Sale, Manchester, yesterday.</p> <p>The in-store surgery, opened by celebrity dentist Lance Knight, will charge \u00a316 for a check-up, which is 20p less than the NHS, and fillings start at \u00a330. Knight claimed the new practice was aimed at making dentistry more accessible.</p> <p>Social worker Mary Gilfoyle, who made dental history as the first emergency patient in a supermarket surgery, said: \"I am really impressed. I now have a new white filling. This will be so convenient for people. It's so easy you can make your appointment, do your shopping or go for a coffee in the cafe while you wait.\"</p> <p>Knight, who treats Manchester City's players, Coronation Street actors and models including Caprice, said that in some areas half the local population was not registered with a dentist because of a shortfall in NHS dentists. </p> <p>\"Everyone finds it is hard to believe it's not just a money-making exercise. That is not the main aim,\" he said. \"I have a very successful practice in Manchester. What we are trying to do is give something back to the man in the street.\"</p> <p>David Gilder, of Sainsbury's, said: \"There is a shortage of dental practices in the UK and the launch of this new service goes some way to providing local people with greater access to dental advice and a range of procedures.\"</p>",

They generally smell a bit whiffy, and half the time you've no idea what the hell they're talking about, but that's part of their charm. </p> <p>\"Can we go truffle bonkers?\" Val asks the fungus man, as he slices up one of his truffles - or \"little black hard balls of glory\" as he calls them - over the scrambled egg he's just knocked up on a camping gas stove in a field. \"Big up the truffle.\" </p> <p>\"Yah, big up the truffle indeed,\" replies the fungus man, who's also quite posh. I think it's fair to say that anyone who cooks eggs with truffles on a camping stove in a field is quite posh. </p> <p>Good food, fresh, local and seasonal: that's Val's shtick. He goes to the Welsh hills and slow-roasts a shoulder of lamb with wild-flower honey and bitter herbs for a farmer and his bewildered mother, who says she likes it but clearly doesn't. She's more interested in Val's lovely blue Le Creuset dish. \"It looks like a spacecraft, doesn't it?\" she says.</p> <p>And Val guns down some bunnies to make a delicious-looking rabbit stew for a bunch of archaeologists in Northumberland. I'm not sure that this is relevant to all of us. I don't actually own a gun, and if I did, I'm not sure what I'd bag here in Dollis Hill. Would the rabbit dish work with cat instead, I wonder? Still, I'm going to have a dig around under my neighbour Sandeep's apple tree, to see if I can find some truffles. I like Valentine and I like the look of what he makes. I'm going to stick with him for a while. </p> <p>The Top Gear trio's influence is spreading, have you noticed? The Biggest Oaf of All is everywhere, all the time. But then The Man With Lady's Hair also got his own show, about 20th-century inventions. And now The One Who Nearly Died is doing <strong>Engineering Connections</strong> (National Geographic). This first one is about the Taipei 101 tower, and how it stands up in a place renowned for its earthquakes and monsoons. </p> <p>I'm not sure it's a good idea, Richard, for a short arse to spend a lot of time standing in front of a very tall building. There'll be some jolly banter from the others I'm sure, when they see that. Also, isn't the new one in Dubai taller? Anyway, he's pretty engaging and enthusiastic, in a Boys Own, ladsy, let's-smash-up-this-model kind of way.</p> <p>My worry is that the Top Gear boys are taking over. It may not end with television either. Their success and popularity is phenomenal. Have you even wondered what would happen if they decided to go into politics? They'd get voted in, that's what. Imagine it - Hammond as chancellor, May as foreign secretary, you-know-who in command. We'd immediately be at war with Germany. Then we really would need to know how to hunt rabbits.</p>",
  "<p>Thailand's ruling party picked the brother-in-law of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra as their nominee for the country's top job yesterday. But the People Power party's (PPP) choice of Somchai Wongsawat, 61, who is married to Thaksin's sister, Yaowapa Wongsawasdi, heralds the prospect of further political unrest after anti-government protesters immediately dismissed his nomination.</p> <p>The People's Alliance for Democracy (Pad), whose activists have occupied the prime minister's Bangkok compound for almost three weeks, had originally demanded that former prime minister Samak Sundaravej step down, accusing him of being a corrupt Thaksin puppet.</p> <p>Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political analyst, said: \"Somchai is going to be a sitting duck if he takes over the premiership, because the Pad will attack his fatal weakness as being Thaksin's brother-in-law.\"</p> <p>Samak, 73, was forced to quit last week when a court ruled he violated the constitution by hosting four episodes of his long-running cookery show after he took office, breaching rules barring ministers' business links.</p> <p>Members of the PPP exploited a loophole in the constitution - rewritten after the 2006 coup that ousted Thaksin - and immediately re-nominated him as their choice for prime minister. But Samak withdrew on Friday after a revolt within his party and the five coalition partners, who failed to appear in sufficient numbers for the parliamentary vote.</p> <p>Hours of talks by PPP elders - with Thaksin, who fled corruption charges for refuge in England, lobbying by telephone - allowed Somchai to beat off two rivals, the justice and finance ministers.</p>",
  "<p>Well, who knew that not drinking could actually be quite simple? I was worried that I'd find sobriety a trial, that I'd be sniffing at bottles of mouthwash come day seven, swigging down mouthfuls of perfume come day 11, and eyeing up that old bucket of meths that we keep in the outside cupboard, adulterated with stray strands of paint, come day 13. But no. I've been booze-free for three weeks and it's fine. I am relieved. </p> <p>And the ease with which I have given up drinking has prompted an entirely unrealistic self-confidence. In fact, I have been feeling so smug that I have started casting around for other indulgences to ditch. That's the problem with discipline - it's addictive. You give up one toxin, and start to imagine that you might become one of those people who everyone simultaneously hates and envies, a control freak of epic proportions, who eschews alcohol, sugar, sweeteners, chocolate, meat, fish, dairy, non-organic vegetables, non-organic anything, cooked food, caffeine, anything with E numbers, any additives at all, and spends at least three and a half hours at the gym each day, performing a type of yoga that gives them both glowing skin and an ability to engage in 10-hour sex marathons. Did I mention the meditation? There's always some of that thrown in, and occasionally some light chanting too. And while such people can obviously be obnoxious, and are definitely not to be trusted, who wouldn't actually love to be just like them in every single way?</p> <p>Over the years I've given up quite a few unhealthy habits, with varying <br>degrees of success. At university I gave up chocolate for a while, and although I eventually fled back to the BP garage to stock up on Curly Wurlies, the period of abstinence did prove useful. I have never since indulged myself with quite the same two-bars-a-day fervour with which I started my university career (although I've certainly sucked down my fair share of chocolate ice cream in the intervening years).</p> <p>My attempt to give up Diet Coke was even less convincing. I have a habit that runs to as many as four cans a day, and two summers ago I decided it was time to cut it out. I figured the best chance to do this would be on my summer holiday, cooped up in a converted bread oven in the Loire. And, indeed, during that week in France, the attempt was very successful. But as soon as I was back at work, I started using Sprite Zero as a substitute. What was the point? The only benefit of replacing the one diet soda with the other was that I was cutting back on my caffeine intake - but it was the caffeine buzz that I loved. After a year, I returned to Diet Coke with gusto. </p> <p>Then there were my meat-and-fish-free years. These started at secondary school when I agreed to join one of my best friends in being a vegetarian. The school had only just started offering meat-free meals, and pupils who wanted them had to sit in special areas. This meant that my friend and I shared a table with five older boys, one of whom christened me Killer Cockroach (in lieu of Kira Cochrane), and spent lunchtimes pulling the wings off daddy-longlegs, then throwing their bodies into my hair. </p> <p>I stayed vegetarian for more than a decade, which should have been healthy - after all, replacing meat with veg can apparently have a huge number of physical benefits. But in the short term, my particular approach to the diet did not make me feel well. All I ate was pasta, potatoes, and sometimes the two mixed together as gnocchi. Oh, and toast. After 11 years I had terrible stomach pains. I could stand it no longer. I ate half a chicken.</p> <p>The problem is that, while I am quite good at giving things up, I tend to fill the gap with substances that are just as bad for me. As of yet, I haven't taken up anything horrendous to replace alcohol, but I have been finding it difficult to keep my food intake down. This suggests that I will never be a hardbody capable of doing 5,000 sit-ups each day at 5am, before breakfasting on cardboard. I'm just going to have to learn to live with that.</p>",
  "<p>Deep in the Cotswolds, under a glowering grey sky, a gaggle of tourists are gazing up Jilly Cooper's drive. \"Wonderful,\" says one. \"Incredible,\" breathes the next. \"It's only a gate,\" says a third and is hushed.</p> <p>We are on the Jillywood Experience, a mini-bus adventure round the celebrity homes of the Cotswolds. It was established two years ago when some locals discovered that you can't swing a cow round here without banging into a supermodel carrying a sheepdog or an actor trying to run a pig farm. It is now Celebrity Central: Pete Doherty has been spotted; Damien Hirst is lurking and Kate Middleton apparently buys cheese in the Waitrose in Cirencester. But the Queen of this Studio 54 with tractors is Jilly Cooper.</p> <p>And so, on a Saturday teatime, I bounce up to Derrick Swann, 71, a former teacher and the creator of Jillywood. \"I am Mr Jillywood,\" he says. What inspired him? \"I saw a film on TV about the tours of stars' homes in Beverly Hills,\" he says. \"We had a minibus, beautiful countryside and all these celebrities in Gloucestershire. So I decided to put something together and have a mobile quiz on board to identify all our local celebrities.\" He says people have come from all over Britain and Jilly herself was once booked on the tour. \"She had to cancel at the last minute,\" he explains. \"But she's endorsed it.\" Derrick says he considered calling the tour \"Hurleywood\", after Liz Hurley, another famous local, but Jilly won out in this celebrity death match. \"Jilly is so loved here,\" Derrick explains, \"because of her Save the Badger campaign.\"</p> <p>We troop on to the minibus, where I meet Pat the minibus driver and my fellow Jilly fans - Margaret, Doreen, Cheryl, Eve, Shirley and Margaret. \"Seat-belts everybody, please,\" says Pat and, shrieking with excitement, we set off.</p> <p>I probe the others about their Jilly love. Margaret doesn't read Jilly, because she lives in Florida, \"and they aren't available in Florida\". Doreen reads Jilly novels occasionally, she says, \"but I'm not sure why\". Margaret asks: \"Wasn't she on that train which had an accident near Paddington?\" \"Yes, she was,\" says Doreen, and they start talking about it. The other Margaret started a Jilly novel once, she says, \"but I had to put it down\". Why? \"Because of everything they got up to with those horses,\" she says. \"I'm a bit old for that\". For what? \"The sex part.\" The bus is divided on Jilly. Half of us think she is a moral desert. The other half thinks she is a queen.</p> <p>\"The tour is about 70 miles,\" says Derrick, handing us each a map dotted with numbers and a bright blue pen that says \"Jillywood\". The clues refer to the celebrities whose houses we are passing. \"Our first celebrity,\" says Derrick happily, \"is dead.\" Dead? As one, the minibus pouts at Derrick. \"I said dead or alive,\" he insists. \"He was one of the Great War poets, he lived his life in a disturbed mental state and he died of tuberculosis in 1937 in the City of London mental hospital. Who is it?\" The bus is silent. When we booked for Jillywood we were thinking glamour, glory and glitz. We weren't thinking mad, institutionalised and dead. It clearly isn't Jilly Cooper. Is it Barry Manilow? \"Ivor Gurney,\" says Derrick, triumphantly. \"The Ivor Gurney.\"</p> <p>As I try not to hate him, Derrick tells me of exciting celebrity feedback to the Jillywood phenomenon. Apparently, Jeremy Clarkson, the star of Top Gear, threatened to murder Jillywood with a shotgun if they ventured down his drive. The celebrity gardener Dom Joly was friendlier - for a \u00a310 fee he offered to appear nude. But in Jillywood it is only Jilly who matters. As I study the map I spot villages named after characters in her novels. There is a France Lynch, named after Ricky France-Lynch, the heartbroken polo player in Polo. There is a Driffield (the miserly rider in Riders) and a Bussage (named after Rannaldini's sex-crazed secretary in Score!) I find this terribly exciting and then wonder - is it sad that I know this? Is it wrong?</p> <p>\"We're coming up to the A40,\" says Derrick, thoughtfully. \"The infamous A40.\" I peer through the gloom. It's a road. Then he points out accident blackspots as in: \"There are often accidents on this road. It's an accident black spot.\" The bus goes a bit quiet. Then Doreen starts talking about llamas. \"The woman four doors away from me has all these alpacas,\" she says, \"and a llama who keeps them in check if they have a confrontation with each other.\"</p> <p>At last we approach Bisley, the home of Jilly - \"journalist, writer and media superstar\" - shouts Derrick. To honour her we do something we won't do for every celebrity home - we get out of the bus. We wander down a hill full of pretty pale houses. I feel very happy. I am always happy when I am near Jilly Cooper. Then we get lost. We can't find it. Where is it? Has it been taken up? We argue, and complain, and at last we find Jilly's gate. \"Beware of the dog,\" says a sign, even though Jilly is famous for buying dogs that don't even like biting food. \"Enter at your own risk.\"</p> <p>We gaze at Jilly's gate. A few of us touch it. Derrick mentions that one time in Bisley, a couple were so dazzled by Jilly's perimeter fence that they lagged behind and missed the mini-bus. \"It was very funny,\" he says, as we melt away. On the way back, we pass a local, who is standing and staring at us the same way a cat might stare at a fully armed Klingon. \"Have you seen Jilly?\" I ask. He pauses. Then he says, reluctantly, and very quietly: \"I have seen her. I have seen her walk the dog. And her husband drinks in the pub.\" And we re-board the bus. \"I think her books are rubbish,\" says Eve.</p> <p>We trundle on, feeling ever more pleased with ourselves, to Brimscombe. \"Our Brimscombe celebrity was a mechanic who invented the lawnmower,\" says Derrick, robotically. \"He died in 1846. Does anyone know his name?\" Nobody does. \"Edwin Budding,\" says Derrick. \"The Edwin Budding.\"</p> <p>I take issue with Derrick about this. Edwin Budding is not a celebrity in this or any universe. He is a spanner inventor. But there is a modern celebrity context to Brimscombe. Damien Hirst has apparently rented one of the outbuildings for his \"art work\". I tell the minibus about Hirst's work. They are gratifyingly disgusted and Margaret stops talking to Doreen about mince pies to squeak in outrage. Then we head for Minchinhampton, the birthplace of the novelist Joanna Trollope. \"A good friend of Jilly Cooper,\" notes Derrick happily. \"She was made deputy lieutenant of the county in 2002.\" We stare out at the roads Joanna might have wandered as a child. It is affluent. Even the cowsheds have For Sale signs saying \"Hamptons International\".</p> <p>The darkness is growing in every way - we are approaching Liz Hurley's house. I am a bit obsessed with her because I once followed her diet - it's one almond every six weeks - and almost died of malnutrition and rage. I briefly wonder if her house is thin. \"We saw her once,\" says Derrick. \"She was returning from some sort of event in London and as we were pulling away from her gate her Mercedes pulled up and we could see it was absolutely Liz Hurley.\" Did she wave? \"No. But it was the definite high point of the Jillywood tour ever. It was,\" he pauses and his chest expands, \"fate.\" We pull up outside the property and examine the area - there is a field, a gate that may be electrified (what a way to die!) and an intercom with buttons saying \"House\", \"Office\" and \"Cancel\". I cannot see the house but if I press cancel, will Liz be cancelled?</p> <p>I chuck a fag butt over the wall (in retribution for the diet) and then I ring the bell. I really do. A voice that sounds suspiciously like Liz Hurley answers. \"Hello,\" it shrieks. \"Hello,\" I say. \"I am with the Jillywood celebrity tour of the Cotswolds and we were wondering if Liz Hurley will come and have her photograph taken with us.\" There is a long pause - longer, even, than Liz's giraffe-like neck - and then the voice that sounds suspiciously like her replies: \"So sorry, she's not here. She's abroad. Sorry.\" The \"sorry\" comes out as a mad bray. I feel it was Liz speaking and I am so happy that she is in on a Saturday night. Unlike me. I am spending my Saturday night traversing the perimeter of her property in a minibus.</p> <p>We are not going to Highgrove, Prince Charles's house, says Derrick, \"because of the time factor\". I am sad about this; I want to see the Royal Stumpery - it is apparently a tree-root leisure feature in his garden. But when we pass through the village of Avening we will be near Princess Anne's home, Gatcombe Park. \"It is to the south-west,\" says Derrick. So somewhere nearby is Princess Anne's jewellery collection, by far the most interesting thing about her.</p> <p>We are now very tired but keep awake by playing a game called Which Waitrose Does Jilly Cooper Shop In and What Does She Buy? I nail Jimi Hendrix for a local when I should have said Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones. Cheltenham, Derrick explains, is rather good for celebs - Eddie \"the Eagle\" Edwards was born here, along with the composer Gustav Holst, the actor Sir Ralph Richardson, and Bomber Harris (was he a celebrity?) Our final (dead) Cheltenham celebrity was \"England 's first sporting hero - a champion jockey for 13 consecutive years who shot himself at the age of 29\". Although we are sorry this celebrity shot himself, nobody knows who he is. Derrick mutters, \"Fred Archer - the Fred Archer\" and throws his notes to the floor, saying he's giving himself the sack.</p> <p>As the bus trundles into Gloucester - they have agreed to drop me at a world-famous chip shop so I can eat world-famous chips - I decide it has been a beautiful experience despite the high dead-celebrity count. It is like an anamatronic version of Heat, with gardens. Perhaps Derrick should organise celebrity tours of other locales - Streatham, Penge, Norbury? But I sense in him a faint regret, an ambivalence about the Jillywood Tour. \"After all,\" he says, \"they come down to Gloucestershire to get away from us.\" Us? Surely they love us - we came forth to worship. We gave up our Saturday night. Derrick peers at me and sucks his Jillywood pen: \"I mean you.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To book the Jillywood Tour call 01452 781055</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday September 25 2008.

  "<p>How could German citizens claim, after the war, to have known nothing about the Holocaust? Ron Jones's attempt to answer this question as a new teacher in 1960s California led to a risky experiment in fascism that has intrigued successive generations ever since. It is the subject of a major new German film, Die Welle (The Wave), released this week.</p> <p>Teachers dream of making a difference to their students' lives. It's part of the joy of teaching. Former students of Jones describe his experiment, known as The Wave, as a milestone in their lives.</p> <p>During project week at Cubberley high school in northern California in April 1967, Jones began teaching his 10th-grade class the power of discipline, drilling them to sit properly and breathe correctly. He made them address him as Mr Jones, stand by their desks when answering questions, and chant slogans.</p> <p>To his surprise, particularly against a backdrop of the \"swinging sixties\" and growing civil-rights activism, his 15-year-old students embraced the strict regime and became more motivated to learn. </p> <p>\"I was accustomed to two very intelligent girls, and the troublemakers at the back of the room. What The Wave generated was a major role for the great majority, who stayed quiet and just got through school. I realised that, as a teacher, I had probably ignored them for the most part. </p> <p>\"All of a sudden, this great mass of energy took place and they were all brilliant in their own way,\" Jones, now 68, explains in a gentle Californian drawl.</p> <p>During about a week of daily lessons, he created a movement. It had a salute (a raised, cupped hand), a slogan - \"strength through discipline, community and action\" - and a secret police force. Students made banners, had membership cards, coerced others to join the movement, beat up those who wouldn't conform and voluntarily informed on each other. </p> <p>Jones even had student bodyguards accompanying him as he walked through the school.</p> <p>One of the original class, Mark Hancock, 57, says students didn't know what to think. \"Jones was the most popular teacher in school. He was only 10 years older than us, so we trusted and liked him a lot. We were 15, the age when you start to get an attitude and think independently. We were idealistic and passionate, but young and impressionable.\"</p> <p>The class was used to Jones's unorthodox ways of bringing topics to life. He had taught them about apartheid by issuing cards with different rules for \"black\" and \"white\" students. He had invited guest speakers to talk about issues from all points of view - even calling Chairman Mao during one lesson. </p> <p>\"Kids would cut classes to go to his, he was that much fun,\" Hancock says. \"He got you involved in the community, not just class.\"</p> <p><strong>Really scary</strong></p> <p>Hancock explains how Jones got The Wave to feel so real. \"He made an effort to make lessons sink in, and this time it did. Big time. The first part was just doing fun games together with our favourite teacher. We'd known Jones for six months and he was always smiling. Two or three days into it, he comes into the classroom not smiling, and he didn't again until it was all over. I'll never forget that day, because it really was scary.\"</p> <p>Jones told the students the experiment was not a game but a movement, involving 1,000 other high schools around the US. A national leader would appear on television to announce a third political party in the country. That appealed to students, who felt betrayed by the handling of the Vietnam war and faced being drafted.</p> <p>\"At that point, it became scary and confusing,\" Hancock says. When it became 'real', it was easier for kids to get aggressive about it. We had to recruit new party members. And if you broke the rules, you would get in trouble with his secret police, who were unknown to us. He had snitches that would turn friends in voluntarily. There was this real fear and intimidation. It was like a police state.</p> <p>\"He broke up lines of communication between students. Some had been friends for 10 years, but you couldn't trust anybody. If you had any doubts or questions or thoughts of resistance, you couldn't tell anyone because you would get in trouble. You didn't dare ask whether it was real or not. </p> <p>\"It moved very fast. Each day, there were more surprises. And each time you thought you had understood it, there would be a new twist. I've been to Germany to talk to people a couple of times, and when the whole National Socialism movement rolled out, it was gradual. Some people got zealous, and some weren't concerned until it was too late.\"</p> <p>After complaints from teachers and parents, and aware that the experiment was spiralling out of control, Jones ended it by calling a rally to which hundreds of students flocked. Only then did he reveal it was a hoax. He projected footage of Hitler and the Nazi rallies on the wall to emphasise how easily the students had been misled into behaving like fascists. </p> <p>These days, Hancock says, he tends to question authority and he admits to being nervous around large groups of passionate people. He and a fellow classmate, Philip Neel, now a film producer, are to tell their stories in a forthcoming documentary. They have tracked down half the class so far.</p> <p><strong>Charismatic</strong></p> <p>\"Mr Jones was very intense, energetic and charismatic. He filled the hour with convincing talk about how discipline and community were positive,\" says Neel. </p> <p>He says the experience taught him it could happen to anyone. \"The most dangerous thing is if someone says 'I could never do that,'\" he says. One of the former students Neel interviewed for the documentary said: \"It was like learning history in the first person. There definitely was a big difference between just reading about it and experiencing it - maybe understanding how it could happen, and how human dynamism plays into it.\"</p> <p>Jones published his own account of The Wave (<a href=\"http://www.vaniercollege.qc.ca/Auxiliary/Psychology/Frank/Thirdwave.html\">vaniercollege.qc.ca/Auxiliary/Psychology/Frank/Thirdwave.html</a>) in 1976, which was made into a <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/5atr7j\">TV film</a> in 1981. This then became the basis for a novel, called The Wave, by teen writer Todd Strasser, under the pseudonym Morton Rhue. It is required reading in many German schools.</p> <p>Die Welle is set in modern-day Germany. Jones says it depicts the experiment well. \"[Denis Gansel, the director,] has captured the nature of kids at this time in life and history in a refreshing and accurate way - kids being technologically connected, and resisting the global economy by burning Nike.\"</p> <p>The film portrays perfectly, Jones adds, the feelings of a younger teacher around older, more experienced teachers, their suspicions of his methods, and the relationship between the teacher and his wife. \"We lived in a tree house in the mountains [the character in the film and his pregnant wife have a houseboat], so it felt true.\" The film's ending is more extreme, but plausible in today's society, according to both Jones and his students.</p> <p>Two years after the experiment, Cubberley school refused Jones tenure - to huge student protests - because, he says, of his anti-war activities. He has spent the past 30 years working with people with mental disabilities, and finds it \"strange\" that he is constantly asked to explain The Wave.</p> <p>\"It was only one week, and we went on to the war in Vietnam, the treatment of black students, feminism, and drugs at the school. Life was pouring down on us. </p> <p>\"But students who have contacted me since all say it had an impact on their life. Many still have their membership cards, say The Wave was a turning point in their lives, and equate it with their success. I find that very strange. You don't know what you do as a teacher sometimes.\"</p> <p>Jones says his own life has been the antithesis of the experiment, \"including people not excluding them, finding kindness and tolerance\". He writes books, plays and poetry, and has a jazz band.</p> <p>\"Life can't be planned. It has to be appreciated. It's strange to be yanked back to try to explain the experiment. But it causes discussion, which is wonderful and necessary. It seems more important today than ever. The US is running amok, to some extent. Fascism is real in homes, places of worship and government,\" he says.</p> <p><strong>Ignorant children</strong></p> <p>He is full of praise for the new film. \"There was real bravery on the part of the Germans to do this. It wouldn't happen in the US. The film won't even show in the US. We're like ignorant children who don't want to see what's going on. We don't look at racism, or study it. The US has no sense of guilt. We don't think about Dresden or Hiroshima or Iraq.\"</p> <p>Would he do The Wave again? No, because it put people in danger. \"I'm very glad I did it for discussional purposes, yes. It's a framework to learn and discuss fascism and what brings us happiness and joy. But it's like the atomic bomb. Is it valuable? Yes, but it's dangerous too.\"</p> <p>Jones says people email him constantly wanting to recreate the experiment. Last month, a British television company proposed it as a reality TV show.</p> <p>\"You can't take children and place them in danger. You unleash something in your own soul, which is even more devastating - the reality that you like it, and that order and control are pretty exciting. We all went through something together. I was not outside the experience.\"</p> <p>The expression on the face of the teacher at the end of the German film is designed to make the audience, everyone, consider their own capacity for evil, says Jones. \"It puts it into a universal context. We're all capable of this nightmare.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Die Welle is released in the UK on Friday</p>",
  "<p>The 1970s were the heyday of the Philly Sound in soul and R&amp;B music, a soft, orchestrated, close-harmony vocal group style that sold millions of records. One of the main purveyors of the Philly Sound was the five-man Spinners group, whose long-serving bass singer, Pervis Jackson, has died of cancer aged 70.</p> <p>The group had its origins among a gang of high school students in Detroit, although Jackson had been born in New Orleans. A few years later, his family joined the vast exodus of African-Americans from the southern states, drawn to the industrial north by the demand for labour of the wartime economy.</p> <p>At school in the suburb of Ferndale, Jackson began to harmonise with other boys, eventually forming a group they called the Domingoes in 1954. Over the next few years they gave occasional concerts and changed both personnel and group name until, in 1961, they settled on the Spinners, with Bobbie Smith as the high tenor lead singer, the tenor George Dixon and the baritones Henry Fambrough and Billy Henderson. \"Spinners\" was the colloquial name for the large hub-caps of Cadillac cars.</p> <p>At this point, they were signed to a recording contract by the local songwriter and performer Harvey Fuqua. That's What Girls Are Made For was an immediate hit, and when Fuqua sold his Tri-Phi record company to his Detroit rival Berry Gordy, the Spinners became part of Gordy's Motown empire.</p> <p>While Gordy and his team built such artists as the Supremes, Stevie Wonder and the Temptations into international stars during the Sixties, Jackson and the Spinners remained among Motown's second division acts. They generally opened the show for other Motown artists. </p> <p>Although they had several R&amp;B successes, their only pop hit was It's a Shame in 1970, written and produced by Wonder. It was also a Top 20 hit in Britain, where the group was renamed the Motown Spinners to avoid confusion with the Liverpudlian folk group the Spinners.</p> <p>In 1971, Philipp\u00e9 Wynne joined as an additional lead singer and, on Aretha Franklin's advice, the group switched record companies to the New York-based Atlantic. The label offered the leading Philly Sound producer Thom Bell the opportunity to work with any of its artists and Bell chose the Spinners. Bell and his songwriters created a series of big hits on which Jackson's deep vocal lines supported Smith's light tenor and Wynne's more gospel-inspired sound. In an interview, Bell paid tribute to the often unnoticed contribution of Jackson: \"It's so low and so deep that most people never want to hear a bass, or so they think. Being kept in the background, you don't feel that you're a real asset to a group.\"</p> <p> Bell therefore gave Jackson a key line to sing (\"12.45\") on the 1975 hit They Just Can't Stop It (Games People Play). \"From the moment I gave him that part, his whole personality changed,\" Bell claimed, and Jackson was subsequently known as \"Mr 12.45\".</p> <p>That record was one of five million-sellers produced by Bell during the seventies, starting with I'll Be Around, in 1972, and Could it Be I'm Falling in Love, a Top 20 hit in Britain, where the group was now known as the Detroit Spinners. The other hits included One of a Kind (Love Affair), The Rubberband Man and Ghetto Child. The group's only No 1 hit in America was Then Came You, a duet between Wynne and Dionne Warwick.</p> <p>In 1977 Wynne left for a solo career and was replaced by John Edwards. His departure coincided with the Philly Sound's loss of popularity to disco and, in 1980, the group switched producers from Bell to Michael Zager. He created two best-selling medleys for the Spinners. The first combined the old Four Seasons hit Working My Way Back to You with Zager's own composition Forgive Me Girl. The second used the same formula with Sam Cooke's Cupid and I've Loved You for a Long Time. The first medley was the group's final million-selling record and their only No 1 hit in Britain.</p> <p>By the mid-1980s, Jackson and the group were playing \"oldies\" concerts with such groups as the Four Seasons and the Righteous Brothers. The final album for Atlantic was Cross Fire, in 1984, although the group was featured in the record company's 40th anniversary concert in New York in 1988. </p> <p>Over the past two decades, the Spinners made a good living singing their repertoire of hits, averaging 200 concerts a year. Besides Jackson, two original members, Fambrough and Smith, were still with the group after over half a century.</p> <p>Jackson is survived by his wife Claudreen, two sons, two daughters and eight grandchildren.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Pervis Jackson, singer, born May 17 1938; died August 18 2008</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown's battle to prevent a challenge to his leadership may end up in the courts, it emerged yesterday.</p> <p>If Labour's national executive committee refuses to send out nomination papers today to rebel MPs who want to force the prime minister into a contest, the party may be vulnerable to a legal fight. Rebels say they would not take the issue to the courts, but claimed two previous party general secretaries - Margaret McDonagh and Peter Watt - had been given legal advice in the past that nomination forms must be sent out if members of the parliamentary party ask for them.</p> <p>The 12 rebels who wrote seeking nomination forms last week are understood to have received informal advice from the former lord chancellor, Lord Falconer.</p> <p>Siobhain McDonagh, MP for Mitcham and Morden, said yesterday: \"The leadership claim this rule has not been used in the past few years, but since when has a law become no longer lawful because it has not been used? If they refuse a leadership contest, people will ask 'what has Brown got to be afraid of'.\"</p> <p>Last night another former minister, Gisela Stuart, joined the revolt, saying that when Brown came to power Labour MPs were humming Things Can Only Get Better, the theme song used for the party's triumphant election campaign in 1997. \"Today it's more likely ... to be 'surely it can't get much worse'. It became clear that not only had we failed to renew ourselves with fresh ideas, we also seem to have lost the knack to tell a good story,\" she said.</p> <p>Downing Street is concerned that serving ministers will join the rebellion. At least three ministers of state in three different departments are known to be close to quitting.</p> <p>McDonagh claimed yesterday to have been inundated by support since being forced to reveal that she believed Brown should allow a leadership contest.</p> <p>The NEC is today expected to back the view of the current general secretary, Ray Collins, that a challenge against a serving Labour prime minister can only be accepted if sought by 71 Labour MPs and the party conference. Leftwingers, including NEC member-elect Peter Kenyon, believe annual nominations should be allowed, but admit the rules are ambiguous. But David Evans, a former assistant general secretary, said the rules were \"crystal clear\" that the papers had to be issued.</p> <p>The legal arguments came as Downing Street waited to see if any government member or parliamentary private secretary would quit ahead of the party conference in Manchester next week. Brown will seek to show he has a full agenda to take Labour forward when he discusses his plans at a cabinet meeting today. In background briefings at the weekend some cabinet members said their patience with Brown's leadership was running thin, and if he did not meet specific tests in the next few months he would be pressed to leave. The tests include the tone of his speech at the conference, his ministerial reshuffle expected next month, the Glenrothes byelection, and his ability to win back voters in the polls.</p> <p>One former minister said the significance of the past 48 hours lay not in the threat from below by ill-organised rebels, but in the fact that \"key figures in the cabinet are putting Gordon on notice. It is now clear they realise we cannot go on like this. It has to be resolved one way or the other and soon. This is not good for the party, the country or the economy\".</p> <p>Brown's cabinet sceptics were disappointed by the handling of the relaunch over the past three weeks, but have not given up hope that his performance and poll standing can improve. But they are not prepared to wait beyond Christmas. Critics were also dismayed at suggestions coming from some of those close to Brown that he would use a reshuffle to promote allies, appointing Ed Balls as chancellor and Nick Brown as chief whip. The prime minister has recently been seeking occasional private advice from Alastair Campbell, the former No 10 communication supremo under Tony Blair.</p> <p>One of the rebels, Greg Pope, MP for Hyndburn, said yesterday: \"Possibly this is unfair on Gordon, but I think the electorate has stopped listening to him, so I think the issue of the leadership has to be forced out into the open. The fact is that in the division lobbies and tearoom the performance of the prime minister, and his mistakes, is the only topic of conversation. I am not embittered. I am not seeking a job, and I am proud to be a backbencher. Nor do I have a candidate, I am not supporting David Miliband or Jack Straw or anyone. But there is no point pretending things are OK when they are not OK.\"</p> <p>Three MPs have lost official positions after going public with their concerns about Brown's leadership. It was confirmed yesterday that Barry Gardiner left his post as the prime minister's envoy on forestry before his newspaper article complaining of \"vacillation, loss of international credibility and timorous political manoeuvres\". His departure - which Downing Street said occurred \"by mutual consent\" over the weekend - followed the sacking of the junior whip, McDonagh, and the party vice-chair, Joan Ryan. </p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>The battle for power in the Labour party is today set to descend into differing interpretations of the Labour <strong>rulebook</strong>, and competing claims as to whether there is a duty on the party general secretary to send out nomination forms annually to MPs. One side points to <strong>Chapter 4 rule B 2 (ii)</strong>, which reads: \"Where there is no vacancy, nominations shall be sought each year prior to the annual session of party conference ... any nomination must be sought by 20% of the Commons members of the PLP.\" That would require 71 MPs, backing a single candidate. The general secretary, <strong>Ray Collins</strong>, was challenged by <strong>Save the Labour Party</strong>, a pressure group, which claims forms used to be dispatched around <strong>February</strong>, but the practice ended under Blair. Collins cited a different rule - <strong>Chapter 4d (ii) </strong>- which states that when the PLP is in government and the leader is prime minister, an election shall only proceed if required by party conference on a card vote.</p>",
  "<p>It is a moment Karl Marx would have relished. From every angle financial capitalism is taking a battering. Late on Sunday one of the world's biggest investment banks, Lehman Brothers, filed for bankruptcy, while another, Merrill Lynch, sold itself off in a hurry to avoid going the same way. Yesterday brought nose-diving shares and a yo-yoing dollar. AIG was once the world's biggest insurer, but its woes today are only making more of a drama out of the crisis. Two pillars of the modern economic temple - greed and prosperity - are trembling in a manner unseen for a very long time. Only a fortnight ago, Alistair Darling attracted derision when he told the Guardian that circumstances were \"arguably the worst they've been in 60 years\". But events of the past 48 hours suggest that - in terms of finance, at least - 75 years might have been a better benchmark. The weather in the money markets is now bleaker than it has been since the 1930s.</p> <p>Fortunately, there is more to economic life than high finance. The economy as a whole is not - yet - in the dire condition it fell into in the mid-70s, early-80s or early-90s - still less the late 1920s and early 1930s. The great danger is that this could change. Many lessons must be learned from what is happening, and in time the rules of casino capitalism will need to be rewritten. But the urgent task for the authorities now is to stop the rot from spreading from the money-men to the rest of us.</p> <h2>Origins of a crisis</h2> <p>\"This time it's different\" are words for which economic historians reserve a special disdain. From the Jenga-like leverage of Wall Street in the 1920s to the pumping-up of the dot-com bubble, irrational exuberance combines greed with gullibility. The sub-prime mortgage crisis was the nemesis of greedy people who thought they could make easy money out of the poor. But it is now accepted among the financial market operators themselves that this crisis was only the trigger for a financial market explosion that was, sooner or later, inevitable.</p> <p>Once again, this time it was not so different after all. As Wall Street's avaricious investment banking business contracts to the point where the only big names left are Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the origins of the crisis are all there in JK Galbraith's The Great Crash 1929 (in a chapter ironically entitled In Goldman, Sachs We Trust). When referring to the crash of a forerunner of Lehman Brothers, in 1929, Galbraith observes: \"As Kreuger and Toll<strong> </strong>moved down to its ultimate value of nothing, leverage was also at work - geometric series are equally dramatic in reverse.\" Until this last weekend, this financial crash, unlike the one in 1929, might have seemed to be occurring in slow motion. Not any more.</p> <p>The intelligent layperson may have been baffled by some of the financial \"instruments\" used by modern financial market \"players\" - collateralised debt instruments, or CDOs, being just one of many. But the essence of what has gone wrong is that the lessons of the 1920s and 1930s were forgotten (or conveniently ignored), even if some of the routes to financial Armageddon had become more sophisticated. We have had a combination of deregulation, \"leveraging\" as if there were no tomorrow (huge debt on a slender asset base, founded on the belief that the bull market was here to stay), and macro-economic policies that paid little attention to asset prices.</p> <p>It may sound harsh to the younger generation to say that the economic effects of the financial crisis have not so far been anything like the recessions of the 1970s, early 1980s and early 1990s. But the emphasis has to be on \"so far\". There is a growing consensus that the UK and other countries are either on the verge of - or in - a recession (we await the official figures for gross domestic product); so far official organisations and the likes of the CBI speak of a couple of quarters of relatively minor contraction, and then resumed growth. But even a minor recession in official terms means rising unemployment, more bankruptcies, and hardship for hundreds of thousands of people. We saw what a doctrinal obsession with restricting the money supply could do to the British economy in the early 1980s. The current credit crunch - the reluctance of financial institutions often to lend, particularly to one another - has frightened even some monetarists into calling for a change of heart on the part of the Bank of England.</p> <p>The danger, and we were seeing signs of this even before the weekend, is of a twin collapse of business and consumer confidence. One can take consolation from the fact that economic policy makers eventually learned a lot from the crises of the interwar years; the Keynesian message - which was essentially that when you are in a hole it is inadvisable to dig deeper - has (with a few hiccups, like that 1980s monetarist phase) been well absorbed. The big question now concerns the willingness of both politicians and central banks to take active steps ideally to dig the economy out of a hole, and at least to prevent a collapse of Keynes's \"animal spirits\" from making it even deeper.</p> <h2>Action required</h2> <p>In the longer term there has to be a much more serious effort at financial regulation, both nationally and internationally. It seems to take a crisis such as 1929-31 to stir governments into serious policing efforts; and the now defunct Bretton Woods system was a delayed reaction to the crises of the inter-war years. At a time like this, the protests from the financial sector, that \"the last thing we need is more regulation\" are risible.</p> <p>So far the Bank of England has been concerned about the impact that forces outside its control - oil and food prices - have had on the inflation rate. But the Bank is supposed to look two years ahead, and the signs now are that, with recessionary forces growing around the world , inflation could actually be below the official target in two years time. The Bank must cut rates without delay to restore confidence.</p>",
  "<p>It is not something you hear much about in the lead-up to a Ryder Cup, but it is surely one of the most important aspects of the host nation's advantage. Over the past few months the US captain, Paul Azinger, will have spent at least as much time considering the presentation of the Jack Nicklaus-designed Valhalla course as he will the four wildcard picks he announced two weeks ago.</p> <p>\"Europe's done a great job of exploiting golf course advantage on us for a long time,\" says Azinger. \"If there is a perceived advantage, I'll try to exploit it.\"</p> <p>So, having studied the strengths and weaknesses of his 12-man squad Azinger will, in conjunction with the course superintendent, try to set up Valhalla in a way he feels will benefit his men. In the same way that a football manager may ask for his pitch to be narrowed when the opposing side have two great wingers, the 1993 US PGA champion has control over such things as the speed of the greens, the depth of the rough and the width of the fairways - many of which are said to be unusually generous at up to 30 yards across.</p> <p>There is nothing new in this. As far back as 1957, when the biennial contest was played at Lindrick in Yorkshire, the fairways and greens were not watered for some time to give the home players an advantage. The rough behind the greens was allowed to grow in the hope of catching US balls as they bounced through the hard, fast putting surfaces.</p> <p>At the Belfry the 2002 European captain, Sam Torrance, set out to penalise the generally longer-hitting US side by narrowing the fairways at about the 280-yard mark. The Scot also had the rough around the greens cut short to nullify the visitors' expertise with the so-called flop shot. \"It is no different from the Aussies preparing wickets to suit their cricket team at home and England doing the same when the Ashes are in this country,\" he wrote. \"We tried to create a course that would conceal our weaknesses and not play into the hands of the Americans.\"</p> <p>In a slightly more sinister fashion, the Nicklaus-led US side at Muirfield Village in 1987 were furnished with intelligence denied to Europe. \"Before the second day's play, the Americans were equipped with detailed information regarding not only the exact areas where the greens had been watered but also the amount of water used, which represents a huge advantage when assessing where to land the ball,\" Nick Faldo wrote in his autobiography. \"Fortunately, Howard Clark overheard what was supposedly a secret conversation and was able to furnish us with all the information, such as, 'The 13th green is watered heavily up to the ridge, then rock hard on the upper tier'.\"</p> <p>These days it is debatable how much of an edge can be gained through such shenanigans, especially when the matches are held in the United States. The likes of Padraig Harrington, Sergio Garc\u00eda, Paul Casey and Justin Rose are hardly intimidated by US-style narrow fairways, deep rough and lightning-fast greens.</p> <p>Still, that fact will not stop Azinger from trying to squeeze any benefit he can from Valhalla. Although the erstwhile TV commentator will no doubt be willing to engage Faldo - his former partner in the ABC commentary booth - in the phoney war of words and psychological mumbo-jumbo that has become a traditional part of the build-up to every Ryder Cup since continental Europe joined the battle in 1979, he is unlikely to reveal much about, say, the speed of the greens.</p> <p>One who is anticipating faster-than-normal putting surfaces is Harrington.</p> <p>\"Every time we have won in recent years, it's been on Europe-paced greens,\" said the Irishman. \"Well, these greens are going to be super-quick at Valhalla this week. When America came from behind to beat us on Sunday at Brookline in 1999, they changed the greens from being European-paced to fast US-paced. We holed all the putts the first two days and they holed all the putts on Sunday. Looking back to the US PGA Championship at Valhalla in 2000, it was like putting on top of a table so there will be a serious advantage there in terms of familiarity for the US players.</p> <p>\"Europe has won and the US lost more Ryder Cups recently because we have holed more putts on greens that suit us better.\" And don't think Azinger hasn't noticed.</p> <h2>Charity begins at home</h2> <p><strong>Lindrick 1957</strong> <strong>GB 7</strong><strong> US 4</strong></p> <p>Course was left unwatered for weeks beforehand and rough grown behind greens</p> <p><strong>East Lake 1963 US 23 GB&amp;I 9</strong></p> <p>As many as 73 bunkers were added and for as long as a year before the matches the rough was fertilised</p> <p><strong>The Belfry 1985</strong> <strong>Europe 16</strong><strong> US 11</strong></p> <p>Tony Jacklin requested that the greens not be cut too close so as to make them slower to putt</p> <p><strong>Muirfield Village 1987</strong> <strong>US 13 Europe 15</strong></p> <p>Only the home players were told where and by how much sections of the greens had been watered</p> <p><strong>The K Club 2006 Europe 18</strong><strong> US 9</strong></p> <p>European team was furnished with the hole locations before the matches began.

  "<p>The provisional release on Thursday of Moroccan blogger <a href=\"http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=28449\">Mohamed Erraji</a> after a farcical, 10-minute trial which imposed on him two years' imprisonment for criticising King Mohamed VI prompted relief among his relatives, bloggers, and freedom-of-expression advocates worldwide. </p> <p>Erraji was interrogated for nearly seven hours on September 4 by the police in Agadir, a tourist resort southwest of the Moroccan capital Rabat, about an article he wrote the day before for the news website <a href=\"http://www.hespress.com/?browser=view&amp;EgyxpID=8508\">HesPress</a> in which he sharply criticised the king for granting \"honours, gratuities and gifts to people upon hearing compliments and praise.\" </p> <p>The young blogger, who is due to appear before a court of appeal next week, wrote: \"Countries which respect their citizens do not turn them into beggars under the feet of nobility. Instead, they develop factories and workshops for them to work in and earn their living with dignity.\"</p> <p>Erraji was jailed the following day, and on September 8 the Agadir court summarily found him guilty under the Press Law of \"failing to respect the king\". He was sentenced under the press law to two years in prison and a fine of 5,000 dirhams (US$626). He was denied the basic right to be assisted by a lawyer.</p> <p>The worldwide outcry spurred by Erraji's detention and trial obviously helped build pressure on high-ranking Moroccan officials, who often boast that they are more committed to the rule of law than their Arab counterparts. The unexpected decision to set him free until the appeal court hearing must have been issued by an authority much higher than the one that hastily decided to send to him to prison for crossing one of the top three red lines: Islam, the monarchy and Morocco's territorial integrity.</p> <p>Many journalists have been prosecuted or sent to prison in recent years for allegedly showing disrespect towards the king or Islam, or questioning the sovereignty of Morocco over the disputed Western Sahara.</p> <p>\"Ironically the same court, which apparently received ministerial instructions to throw Erraji in jail and teach him a lesson, was ordered by probably the Royal cabinet to release him. They realised that they rushed into judgement and made a mistake,\" a Moroccan lawyer said on condition of anonymity.</p> <p>Although it seems unlikely that the appeal court would uphold the prison sentence, particularly after the launch of a huge campaign of solidarity with Erraji, Moroccans remain deeply concerned about the rising attacks on freedom of expression in their country which started making unparalleled steps toward political reform before King Mohamed VI ascended the throne in 1999.</p> <p>CPJ research and a fact-finding mission in 2007 documented in a <a href=\"http://www.cpj.org/Briefings/2007/morocco_07/moroccoweb.html \">special report</a> found out that freedom of the press has been continuously rolled back over the last six years in Morocco, which ranked second behind Tunisia as the worst jailer of journalists in the Arab world.</p> <p>In addition to the surge in politically motivated cases, the use of the judiciary to settle political scores with critical journalists is a major source of concern. Many of the most brilliant journalists were either silenced or forced into exile following unfair trials, like Ali L'mrabet and Aboubakir Jamai.</p> <p>\"Judges should listen to the voice of their conscience, not to instructions given through their cellular phones,\" Abbas al-Fassi said in a February 2007 interview with the independent daily Al-Massae, long before he became Morocco's prime minister.</p> <p>Erraji is the latest victim of the terrible judicial machine apparently still in the hands of powerful and entrenched bureaucrats nostalgic of the era of ruthless repression of dissent and critical journalism, widely referred to by Moroccans as the \"Years of Lead\". </p> <p>But in the long run it's unlikely that this repressive machine and its masters will have the final say in a country with one of the most thriving civil societies in the region and where journalists like Mustapha Hormatallah leave prison more determined to protect their right to freedom of expression. Hormatallah of Al Watan al-An was released in July after serving eight months in a Casablanca prison for disclosure of state security secrets and undermining the security of the state.</p> <p><em>Kamel Labidi is Middle East consultant for the Committee to Protect Journalists</em></p>",
  "<p>Richard Corbett's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/12/eu\">article</a> on a social Europe contains his predictable bashing of the Conservatives, which is also his favourite hobby in Brussels. But most people are getting tired of this negativism from the left. They are looking to politicians to give a positive lead in overcoming divisions in society rather than just proclaiming them. Certainly that is what Conservatives are now determined to do. You learn a lot in opposition: the trick is not to forget it all when you reach government. <br> As Corbett's article was about a social Europe, I shall not dwell on what needs to be done back home in the UK \u2013 other than to say that David Cameron's focus on our <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6281350.stm\">broken society</a> reflects his clear priorities for an incoming government to address a real and growing problem.<br> In Brussels the agenda also needs to move forward, and our priorities are equally clear. We believe that the EU is about people. It must be, and be seen to be, providing and promoting greater opportunities for more people. These include life-long learning; greater mobility to work, study or draw a pension in another EU country; a better work-life balance, and above all more freedom of choice as to how to achieve it.  Of course it includes recognition and protection of workers' rights. But it also includes the rights of people who are not in work, but who very much want a job. Those who care about social justice, whether from the left or the right, should surely agree that one of the greatest social injustices of all is unemployment. In these tough economic times politicians have to work even harder to find ways through. Measures that protect those who have jobs by raising barriers against those who don't are hardly the best answer. In the run-up to the European parliamentary elections next June, the shaping of society may well be a key battleground for the two major political parties. In fact the battlelines are already being drawn on three particular pieces of EU legislation. These are the <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexapi!prod!CELEXnumdoc&amp;lg=EN&amp;numdoc=31994L0045&amp;model=guichett\">European works council directive</a>, the <a href=\" http://www.berr.gov.uk/employment/employment-agencies/consultation-2002/page30034.html\">temporary agency workers directive</a>, and the <a href=\"http://uk.ihs.com/news/newsletters/ohsis/ohsis-nov04-working-time-directive-revision.htm\">revision of the working time directive</a>. All three have been log-jammed for some time, with entrenched and opposing views blocking any agreement. But all three are now on the move, and MEPs have a real chance to finally sign them off.<br> The one I am personally working on is the recasting of the European works council directive, also mentioned by Richard Corbett, as I will be drafting the official parliament report. In recent weeks I have had a number of discussions with senior trade union leaders in the <a href=\"http://www.etuc.org/\">ETUC</a> \u2013 and we have found almost complete agreement. The social partners, ie the trade unions and the employers' organisations, have themselves agreed (to their mutual surprise, I suspect) a common approach that will provide the basis of agreement. I believe it is my responsibility, together with MEP colleagues, to help deliver that agreement rather than propose amendments that might derail it. Where the major stakeholders agree, their wishes should surely prevail. <br> On temporary workers, where again there has been agreement with social partners, I take a similar view. Conservatives will not table any amendments, and would hope that it can be signed off at first reading.  On working time I also believe we should put past divisions behind us, and should seek to sign up to the new common position and help to make it happen. The trade unions and the employers want it. We want it \u2013 but will Labour be prepared to move forward and show a similar flexibility to achieve it?  So watch this space in the months to come. People are looking to politicians to deliver results. They will not thank us if we cling to out-dated ideologies \u2013 and only deliver speeches.</p>",

  "<p>One of the most famous <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIyewCdXMzk\">political attack ads</a> in US history hails from the <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4D81F3BF930A1575AC0A966958260\">1990 Senate race</a> between white Republican Jesse Helms and African-American Democrat Harvey Gantt. The text of the ad read:</p> <blockquote> <p>You needed that job. And you were the best qualified. But they had to give it to a minority, because of a racial quota. Is that really fair? Harvey Gantt says it is.</p> <p>You'll vote on this issue next Tuesday. For racial quotas: Harvey Gantt. Against racial quotas: Jesse Helms.</p> </blockquote> <p>Another <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4D81F3BF930A1575AC0A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2\">Helms ad</a> read:</p> <blockquote> <p>Harvey Gantt is asking you and me to approve of some pretty awful things. Aborting a child in the final weeks of pregnancy. Aborting a child because it is a girl instead of a boy. That's too liberal. Harvey Gantt is asking us to approve some pretty extreme views to vote for him.</p> </blockquote> <p>Gantt denied that he would allow abortion for sex selection, but the mud stuck. Helms exploited the vehemence with which very conservative voters hate reproductive choice and used it to smear Gantt to defeat. Helms, like John McCain and Sarah Palin, supported outlawing of abortion with one exception: when the life of the pregnant woman is endangered. (Palin believes mothers who are raped, or girls who are the victims of incest should be forced to have their attacker's baby. John McCain <a href=\"http://www.lifenews.com/nat4296.html\">wants Roe v Wade overturned</a>.) </p> <p>In American political advertising, accusing your opponent of taking extreme political positions is one of the oldest tricks in the book. Truth is entirely optional, and marrying race baiting with extremism is often one of the most effective tactics. </p> <p>Reading coverage of the Gantt-Helms race (which Helms won) I'm eerily reminded of how the Obama-McCain race is shaping up. Sex has surfaced again in Election 2008, and McCain's recent ad is heir to the Helms tradition of hate and fear-mongering. In his latest attack ad, McCain says Obama is \"wrong for your family\" and cites:</p> <blockquote> <p>Obama's one accomplishment? Legislation to teach \"comprehensive sex education\" to kindergartners. Learning about sex before learning to read?</p> </blockquote> <p>The ad is <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/09/new_mccain_ad_badly_distorts_o_1.php\">downright</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/us/politics/11checkpoint.html?bl&amp;ex=1221278400&amp;en=139555dd265b8c71&amp;ei=5087%0A\">false</a>. And, as several people have noted, it's not an accident that Obama is shown superimposed in front of a shot of all white kindergartners. Yet again, we have the right wing showing \"extreme\" black politicians endangering white America. From Gantt to Willie Horton to Harold Ford in Tennessee, it's an old Republican favourite. And by God, it seems to work. When all else fails, roll out the culture wars. Sex ed, abortion and gays are guaranteed red meat. </p> <p>Usually, Democrats roll their eyes and throw up their hands.

Attack and do whatever it takes to win this election.\"</p> <p>Is this going to be the year the Democrats fight back? I don't care about the real meaning of lipstick. I want Obama to tear these lying pols apart. And I am far, far from alone. Most Democrats are desperate for it. McCain and Palin take really extreme, outside the mainstream positions, and Americans need to hear about it. </p> <p>Here's a good place to start: When she was mayor of Wasilla, Palin charged sexual assault victims or their insurance companies for <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-09-10-rape-exams_N.htm\">ordering rape kits</a>. Apparently she and her government didn't want to put a \"burden\" on the taxpayer. </p> <p>As John Aravosis <a href=\"http://www.americablog.com/2008/09/more-media-pick-up-on-story-that-palin.html\">writes</a>, the rape kit issue would hit McCain and \"drive a wedge between him and women and independents. To put McCain and Palin on the side of rapists versus rape victims. To change the discussion of the entire week from lipstick and fish to a real issue that scares the hell out of women, and men, across America.\"</p> <p>Imagine a young girl who's been raped and not only has to come forward and deal with the complicated and often humiliating process of a rape allegation, but who has to pay a couple hundred dollars for proof of her attack, or ask her parents about their insurance plan? I'd like to see this story framed in an attack ad. \"McCain-Palin think victims should pay for being raped.\"</p>",
  "<p>As you are now almost certainly aware, Switzerland added to its rich history of brotherly love and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50wpkPXejnM&amp;feature=related\">cuckoo clocks</a> with a chapter on <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.co.uk/zdnetuk/news/emergingtech/0,1000000183,39486094,00.htm\">particle accelerators</a> last week. There are myriad reasons why it was business as usual in Geneva, rather than the widely reported black-hole-induced end of times, including that the possibility of creating black holes in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) was minuscule, and if they did occur they would be tiny and snuffed out almost instantaneously. And most significantly, the collisions which were extremely unlikely to have created said tiny singularities are not due to start for a few weeks. As Manchester University's Brian Cox succinctly <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/earth/2008/09/05/scilhc105.xml\">told</a> the Telegraph, \"Anyone who thinks the LHC will destroy the world is a twat\".</p> <p>Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the world wide web whilst working at Cern, has today expressed concerns that the level of this type of twattery on the internet needs to be monitored and identified. Announcing his World Wide Web Foundation, He <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7613201.stm\">told</a> the BBC that systems for labelling websites' trustworthiness were required to help users filter out the extraordinary volumes of guff. Berners-Lee picks out two examples in which he claims untruths have been peddled and developed unmediated though the web: the fictional black holes at Cern and the categorically untrue claims of a connection between the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/feb/05/health.children?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront\">MMR vaccine</a> and autism. </p> <p>However in both these examples, the main engine of wrongheadedness is not the web per se, but mainstream media. In the case of the LHC, all coverage \u2013 from the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7599000/7599588.stm\">relentless</a> John Humphrys on the Today programme to reports from every single British newspaper \u2013 perpetuated the apocalyptic fantasy. The repercussions of such boringly repetitive reporting for Cern are insignificant. In fact, it may have been the best thing that could've happened to physics, at a time when teaching the subject is somewhat <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/01/physics.schools\">in crisis</a>. It may be tiresome, but all of a sudden there is talk of bosons in the <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/article1630897.ece\">Sun</a>. </p> <p>In the case of MMR, the repercussions are immeasurably more serious. As a result of myths perpetuated by many newspapers, MMR uptake in the UK has plummeted to an all-time low, and there were more cases of measles in England and Wales in 2006 and 2007 than in the previous 10 years put together.</p> <p>It may be the case that these fictions grew in the foetid atmosphere of cyberspace, but their roots were in the press, and were perpetuated by the press. To blame the web is incorrect. How would newspaper websites be labelled under Berners-Lee's plan? For the LHC, would you adorn coverage with the warning \"Features childish and lazy journalism\"? Or for reports that perpetuate the connection between MMR and autism: \"Harbours misinformation that could result in a potentially lethal epidemic\"? For messageboards the legend would simply be \"May contain idiots\".</p> <p>Berners-Lee is surely no fool, but implementing a badge of trust system would be impossible. The web evolves according to a form of natural selection: stuff that works well survives, but it isn't determined by any overarching guidance. The emergence of web 2.0-type sites has rendered any attempt to place control of the internet into just a few hands futile. Wikipedia's self-monitoring works, as long as you are smart about what Wikipedia is: not a bad place to start proper research. Its warning systems, such as information about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_words\">weasel words</a>, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Wikipedia\">copyediting standards</a> exist so that other users can correct errors. But Wikipedia is a far more democratic space than the rest of the web. The sheer volume of information would render Berners-Lee's proposal a Sisyphean task, and ultimately pointless. The web is not, and has never been a democracy. </p> <p>Part of Berners-Lee's World Wide Web Foundation mission is to help the web evolve to be more accessible in developing countries. It's a noble aim to turn the web into something more useful than it already is. But to moderate it for trustworthiness is a subjective exercise and wrong. If Berners-Lee's examples are anything to go by, we don't need trust monitoring, we need more honest, more informed, better researched, less shrill \u2013 better \u2013 journalism.</p> <p>Conspiracies will always rage wherever people meet, be it online or in the pub, but better reporting will quieten them down. In both locations the capacity for talking rubbish is also the source of their wonder. The nature of the web's <a href=\"http://www.thelongtail.com/\">long tail</a> enables everyone with access to stumble upon likeminded comrades in a way that has never before been possible, no matter how deviant or unusual. But you'd never stick a sign above a pub that reads \"Warning: the veracity of content is highly suspicious, please exercise caution\".</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/12/bolivia.brazil\">The crisis in Bolivia</a> could be the first big test of the newly formed Union of Nations of South America (Unasul) which is convening an <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5j9QrKFN3BUxRUm-PQO8EdTzAUVAQD93692HO0\">emergency meeting</a> starting today in Chile.</p> <p>The meeting has been called by Chile's President Michelle Bachelet in a bid to defuse a dispute that has so far claimed 18 lives and threatens to tear apart the poorest country in Latin America. </p> <p>Brazil's President Lula confirmed his attendance after receiving confirmation from Bolivia's President Evo Morales that the initiative had his support. He also said in a statement that there would be no point meeting unless both the Bolivian government and opposition were committed to dialogue. In a thinly veiled reference to Venezuela's President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, he <br><a href=\"http://www.nowpublic.com/world/lula-foreign-intromission-bolivian-crises-will-not-be-tolerated\">stated</a> that: </p> <blockquote> <p> We have no right to make any decision without the agreement of Bolivian government and opposition. They are the ones who have to provide the framework for our participation, otherwise we will be infringing the sovereignty of another country and that is not acceptable for Brazil.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lula has faced some domestic political criticism for not immediately defending Bolivia's territorial integrity more strongly. The crisis pits the country's democratically elected president, who has the strong support of its poor indigenous majority against the rich, white descendants of European settlers who are concentrated in the east of the country.</p> <p>This is also where the majority of its lucrative gas reserves and soya farms are located. The opposition has rejected the country's new draft constitution, which was strongly endorsed in a referendum, and are demanding regional autonomy and a greater share of the gas profits. Their protests have become increasingly violent and last Thursday, 16 Morales supporters were massacred when a lorry was ambushed, prompting the declaration of martial law the following day. Since then there have been more deaths, a bomb attack on a pipeline and widespread looting and destruction.</p> <p>Morales also ordered the expulsion of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/12/bolivia.venezuela\">US ambassador</a> to Bolivia, Philip Goldberg, whom he accused of \"conspiring against democracy\" and encouraging the separatists. Ch\u00e1vez expelled the US ambassador to Venezuela shortly afterwards, partly as a gesture of solidarity, but also because he claimed to have discovered independent evidence of a coup plot against him. \"Go to hell a hundred times, fucking Yankees \u2026 When there will be a new government in the United States, you will send an ambassador, a government that respects the people of Latin America,\" <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/news/video?videoId=90536\">he said in a speech</a>. </p> <p>A US state department spokesperson, responded that \"We regret the actions of both President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and President Evo Morales to expel our ambassadors. This reflects the weakness and desperation of these leaders as they face internal challenges, and an inability to communicate effectively internationally in order to build international support.\" Whatever the rights and wrongs of the second expulsion, the behaviour of <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/73005.htm\">Goldberg</a> in Bolivia has caused considerable controversy. He had met with a group of opposition leaders the previous week despite the fact that these have been giving de facto support to a blatantly illegal and violent campaign against a democratically elected government. Goldberg had previously served as an envoy to the Balkans and came to Bolivia straight from Kosovo, which has fed speculation that the US has a secessionist agenda. Given the sensitivities his behaviour appears to have been undiplomatic at the very least.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez further upped the political ante by threatening military intervention in Bolivia if there was a coup attempt, which prompted a Bolivian general, Luis Trigo, to state that the army would not tolerate any foreign intervention from Chavez or any other country. Lula's call for dialogue and pointed reaffirmation that respecting Bolivia's sovereignty meant supporting its right to solve its own problems has also been seen as a rebuke to Ch\u00e1vez.</p> <p>Bolivia borders Brazil and is its largest supplier of natural gas. Two years ago Morales \"nationalised\" its gas reserves and seized the assets of the Brazilian State owned company Petrobras. The two sides subsequently negotiated a new deal on the share of revenues.</p> <p>The attempts by Bachelet and Lula to resolve the Bolivian crisis through <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_South_American_Nations\">UNASUL</a> will also be an important test of the effectiveness of the new body, which was formally signed into being at a meeting in Brasilia in May.</p> <p>It integrates two existing customs unions; Mercosur and the Andean community, as part of a continuing process of South American integration modeled on the European Union. The dream of closer Latin American integration has long been an article of faith among the continent's left. Today's meeting will show whether they have the diplomatic skills necessary for the task.</p>",
  "<p>Desmond Tutu, the South African Nobel laureate, said today there was a \"possibility\" Israel had committed a war crime when its artillery shells killed 18 Palestinians from a single family in Gaza two years ago.</p> <p>Tutu said the Israeli artillery shelling which hit the Athamna family house showed \"a disproportionate and reckless disregard for Palestinian civilian life\".</p> <p>The archbishop presented his comments in a <a href=\"http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/9session/A.HRC.9.26.doc\">final report to the UN human rights council</a>, which had sent him to Gaza to investigate the killings in Beit Hanoun in November 2006. Israel did not grant the archbishop or his team a visa for 18 months, so they only entered Gaza in May this year on a rare crossing from Egypt.</p> <p>On the three-day visit, Tutu and his team visited the house, interviewed the survivors and met others in Gaza, including the senior Hamas figure and former prime minister Ismail Haniyeh. At the time Tutu said he wanted to travel to Israel to hear the Israeli account of events, but he was not permitted.</p> <p>\"In the absence of a well-founded explanation from the Israeli military - who is in sole possession of the relevant facts - the mission must conclude that there is a possibility that the shelling of Beit Hanoun constituted a war crime,\" Tutu said in his report to the 47-member council.</p> <p>He also recommended that Israel pay adequate compensation to the victims \"without delay\". His report said \"reparation\" should also be made to the town of Beit Hanoun itself, and suggested a memorial to the victims that also helped the survivors, and suggested a physiotheraphy clinic as one possibility.</p> <p>Tutu also said that rockets fired by Palestinian militants into southern Israel should stop and should be investigated. \"Those firing rockets on Israeli civilians are no less accountable that the Israeli military for their actions,\" he said.</p> <p>For the past three months a ceasefire between Israel and the militant groups in Gaza has been in place and has significantly reduced the number of incidents and the death toll from the conflict there. Israel still maintains a tough economic blockade on the territory, restricting imports and banning nearly all exports.</p> <p>\"It is not too late for an independent, impartial and transparent investigation of the shelling to be held,\" Tutu said. He said those responsible for firing the shells should be held accountable, whether the cause of the incident was a mistake or wilful.</p> <p>After the incident, Israel's military said the shelling into Beit Hanoun that day was mistaken and was the result of a \"rare and severe failure in the artillery fire control system\" which created \"incorrect range-findings\". It said the shells had been aimed 450 metres away from the edge of town. No legal action was taken against any officer. </p> <p>However, it is still unclear why the artillery was fired so close to a residential area that morning and why shells continued to be fired after the first one hit the Athamna house - at least six shells, possibly more, were fired within a few minutes.</p> <p>The survivors in the family remain bitter and most of the large extended family no longer live in the building. Since the shelling they have received no financial help, apart from a monthly stipend from the Palestinian Authority of \u00a350 for each of the 18 dead.</p> <p>Aharon Leshno-Yaar, Israel's ambassador to the UN in Geneva, where the human rights council was meeting, rejected Tutu's report as \"another regrettable produce of the human rights council.\" </p> <p>\"It is regrettable that this mission took place at all,\" he told the Associated Press. Israel regards the council as politicised and biased against Israel.</p> <p>He said the report gave de facto legitimacy to Hamas, the Islamist movement that won elections in 2006 and then seized full control of Gaza last year. \"This does not serve the interests of Israel or the Palestinians or the cause of peace between Israelis and Palestinians,\" Leshno-Yaar said.</p> <p>Tutu also called on Israel to stop restricting the movement of medical goods and of people in and out of Gaza, which he said was preventing Gazans from getting access to medical services.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Copenhagen, Denmark. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Mette Lindberg (vocals), Lars Iversen (bass, keyboards), Miloud Carl Sabri (trumpet), Sven Meinild (sax), Mads Brinch Nielsen (guitar, keyboards), Jesper Elnegaard (drums).<br> <strong>The background:</strong> The current fascination with mid-60s soul isn't just confined to British performers. The Asteroids Galaxy Tour are a Danish duo, with additional musicians for gigs, who give the sounds of Stax and Motown a sort of sunny, summery, almost psychedelic air. The rhythms are basic, direct and insistent, the melodies so instantly infectious you'll probably think you've heard them before, and there is a horn section (including trumpet and sax) to give the songs that all-important soul-revue feel \u2013 the group's name even sounds like a cosmic version of one of those 60s soul package tours. <br> Their debut single, which is already all over the radio, sets out their stall with gusto and verve (although it sounds nothing like the Verve). The Sun Ain't Shining No More is like a Dusty Springfield tune, with a production worthy of Mark Ronson (it was recorded, predictably, using vintage equipment), put through a woozy psych filter. Then there's Around the Bend, which is ebullient enough for Apple to have chosen it for their brand new <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/gallery/ads/\">iPod Touch advert</a> in the States; it has the loping gait of late-80s indie-dance, like the shuffling pop of the Mock Turtles' one-off hit Can You Dig It? or a \"baggy\" lost classic. But it's Mette Lindberg's voice that is TAGT's secret weapon. Well, not so secret \u2013 it's all over their music like Day-Glo graffiti, a weird, idiosyncratically powerful thing that manages to be simultaneously soulful and squeaky, like Clare Grogan or Cerys Matthews doing a comical impression of Amy Winehouse. You'll either be enraptured or want to smother the life out of your radio with a cushion. Mind you, before you get too irate, you might want to have a quick glance at the woman \u2013 she's so good-looking you'll forgive her every high-pitched yelp. <br> Don't get too carried away, though \u2013 we think she's taken, by her musical other half. Formed only a year ago, Lindberg and Iversen spent last summer living and writing, eating and sleeping in the latter's self-built studio in his one-room flat in Copenhagen. Before long they had a repertoire of psych-soul ditties. They began rehearsing for shows in an underground air-raid shelter and were invited to play their first-ever gig as support for Amy Winehouse at the biggest venue in Copenhagen, at the request of the singer's \"people\" (though probably not her dad, Mitch \u2013 he had a pick-up at Heathrow at the time). Soon after, a demo found its way to London and within days the pair were offered a management deal by David Enthoven and Tim Clark, who have looked after the careers of T Rex, Roxy Music and Robbie Williams. Bolan, Ferry, Robbie and now Lindberg, eh? Well, three out of four ain't bad.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Fab, groovy and out of this world!\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> Just keep them away from Jerry Hall and Mini Coopers and they should have a long and fruitful career. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Be strong-armed into writing and producing Robbie's next album.<br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Make Amy Winehouse pitch-shift her vocals on her next album. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> The Sun Ain't Shining No More is released next week by Small Giants. The band play at the Barfly in Camden, north London, this Wednesday. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Candie Payne, Duffy, Cerys Matthews, Nina Persson. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/theasteroidsgalaxytour\">www.myspace.com/theasteroidsgalaxytour</a> <br><strong><br>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Hearts Revolution. <br> </p>",
  "<p>On a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/15/marketturmoil.stockmarkets\">day like this</a>, with such convulsive events taking place in the banks and bourses of the world, there is no point denying that there is a certain perversity in continuing to focus, not on the future of capitalism but on the Liberal Democrats' electoral prospects in Conservative marginals in southern England. There is, nevertheless, a connection between the two, as a high-powered debate at the Guardian's annual lunchtime fringe meeting in Bournemouth made clear.</p> <p>Is the next general election a threat to or an opportunity for the Liberal Democrats? Professor John Curtice of Strathclyde University thinks the answer is a bit of both. It is an opportunity because the Lib Dems can surely profit electorally from the most unpopular Labour government in history led by the most unpopular Labour leader in history. Since there are almost as many Lib Dem <a href=\"http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/guide/liberal-democrat-target-seats\">target seats</a> in which the sitting MP is Labour as ones where the incumbent is a Tory, 2010 could offer the Lib Dems the chance to drive forward their good performance of 2005 in Labour areas and capture several seats.</p> <p>The threat is that the Lib Dems are simply <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/polls\">polling too low</a> \u2013 their mean poll rating is generally in the upper teens at the moment \u2013 to reap that benefit. Disaffected Labour voters are switching to the David Cameron's Tories more than to Nick Clegg's party. Since 70% of sitting Lib Dem MPs are faced with Tory challengers in second place, the party will have its hands full holding on to its existing seats, never mind capturing any new ones.</p> <p>But in Curtice's view, the best word to describe Lib Dem prospects is neither opportunity nor threat. The best word is gamble. From being the party generally associated in the public mind with high tax and spending policies, the Lib Dems are attempting to reinvent themselves for 2010 as a low tax party. This could be in tune with the public mood, says Curtice, since public opinion is shifting back towards 1980s-style wariness over taxation \u2013 a mood that is certain to be intensified by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/15/marketturmoil.stockmarkets\">events</a> of the last 24 hours on Wall Street. But it will have to be well sold, to change public perceptions about the party.</p> <p>In reply, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/15/libdemconference.liberaldemocrats1\">Chris Huhne</a> traded psephological punches with Curtice. The Nuffield general election study has shown that Lib Dem MPs are better at defending their seats than MPs of other parties. The incumbency factor works more strongly in their seats than in Labour or Tory held seats. It gives Lib Dem MPs a 6.6% margin over their challengers. Against that background, the Lib Dems' current 18% average rating in national polls doesn't look so bad, given that the party can generally expect to do well during the campaign itself. The Lib Dems got more of the anti-Labour swing than the Tories in 2001 (when there hardly was such a swing) and in 2005 (but that was before Cameron); so they can do it again, said Huhne.</p> <p>It required Ming Campbell to bring a bit of old-style political passion to this cerebral trading of figures. In his first substantial party speech since resigning the party leadership last year, Campbell joined Huhne in defining the next election as an opportunity rather than a threat for the Lib Dems. But he did so very much on his own terms. There was a gap in the political market for a party of the centre-left, said the ex-leader, and that party is the Liberal Democrats.</p> <p>Campbell's old-time religion was a useful reminder. Much may have changed this week in the way the Liberal Democrats present themselves. The shift on tax and spend policy is a significant repositioning, if it can be sold effectively in the way that Huhne believes it can. In the end, though, this party is instinctively a party of the centre-left, just as Campbell says. Its brain may tell it that the party's values must be translated into policies in new ways. But its heart remains where it has always been. And that, as Curtice pointed out, means that the Lib Dems must also work out something else. They need to decide whether and how they might cooperate with a Conservative government or with a hung parliament in which the Tories were the largest single party. Is that a threat or an opportunity? For many Lib Dems, it would be easier to solve the world banking crisis than to answer that one.</p>",
  "<p>It was pretty clear from yesterday's papers that we've just entered Phase II of Palinophilia.</p> <p>Phase I was the Palin-as-phenomenon phase. Since everyone had barely heard of her when McCain named her, there was an inevitable period of \"Gee, who is this woman?\" coverage. </p> <p>That kind of coverage of someone who has burst onto a scene, whether in politics or business or sports-wth-an-s or whatever, tends inevitably toward the positive. It's never <em>all</em> positive, and it certainly wasn't that in Palin's case, because we had the revelation about the daughter's pregnancy and a few other things. But basically it's personality-driven coverage, highlighting the person's hobbies and likes and dislikes and alleged values. And she has a personality that many Americans like, and of course she did deliver a crowd-pleasing speech in St Paul, so Phase I worked largely to her benefit.</p> <p>But now we've clearly entered Phase II, in which the journalism is less about personality and more about policy and her record. The results are consierably less flattering.</p> <p>I count four important pieces in just the last two days. The one that's attracted the most attention is yesterday's <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/us/politics/14palin.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;hp\">huge New York Times takeout</a> on how she's governed Alaska. Required reading if you haven't delved into it. The portrait here is of a deeply insecure person with at once a wobbly command of government and fiercely ideological world view (a great combination!) whose administration abused power to conceal the first fact and enforce the second:</p> <blockquote> <p>Interviews show that Ms Palin runs an administration that puts a premium on loyalty and secrecy. The governor and her top officials sometimes use personal email accounts for state business; dozens of e-mail messages obtained by the New York Times show that her staff members studied whether that could allow them to circumvent subpoenas seeking public records.</p> <p>Rick Steiner, a University of Alaska professor, sought the email messages of state scientists who had examined the effect of global warming on polar bears. (Ms Palin said the scientists had found no ill effects, and she has sued the federal government to block the listing of the bears as endangered.) An administration official told Mr Steiner that his request would cost $468,784 to process.</p> <p>When Mr Steiner finally obtained the email messages \u2014 through a federal records request \u2014 he discovered that state scientists had in fact agreed that the bears were in danger, records show.</p> <p>\"Their secrecy is off the charts,\" Mr Steiner said.</p> </blockquote> <p>I don't know what will come of this. But the idea that a gubernatorial administration anywhere in this country secretly decided that they should all discuss governance and patronage issues using their personal email accounts rather than governmental ones is a very serious matter. The Bush White House <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_White_House_e-mail_controversy\">deleted -- er, \"lost\" -- up to 5 million emails</a> related to the US attorneys scandal. If the White House weren't ignoring subpoeans and flouting the law, this face alone may well have been enough to warrant impeachment proceedings. </p> <p>Even more damning in some ways was yesterday's Washington Post piece about how Palin ran Wasilla. In most towns in most states, mayors at least have to oversee four basic things: police, fire, schools and garbage pickup. But of these Palin apparently didn't even have to deal with three of them:</p> <blockquote> <p>Firefighting and schools, two of the main elements of local governance, are handled by the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, the regional government for a huge swath of central Alaska. The state has jurisdiction over social services and environmental regulations such as stormwater management for building projects.</p> <p>With so many government services in the state subsidized by oil revenue, and with no need to provide for local schools, Wasilla has also made do with a very low property tax rate -- cut altogether by Palin's successor -- sparing it from the tax battles that localities elsewhere must deal with. Instead, the city collects a 2 percent sales tax, the bulk of which is paid by people who live outside town and shop at its big-box stores.</p> <p>The mayor oversees a police department created three years before Palin took office; the public works department; the parks and recreation department; a planning office; a library; and a small history museum. Council meetings are in the low-ceilinged basement of the town hall, a former school, and often the only residents who show up to testify are two gadflies. When Palin was mayor, the population was just 5,500.</p> <p>Palin limited her duties further by hiring a deputy administrator to handle much of the town's day-to-day management. Her top achievement as mayor was the construction of an ice rink, a project that landed in the courts and cost the city more than expected.</p> <p>Arriving in office, Palin herself played down the demands of the job in response to residents who worried that her move to oust veteran officials would leave the town in the lurch. \"It's not rocket science,\" Palin said, according to the town newspaper, the Frontiersman. \"It's $6 million and 53 employees.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In GOP-spin world, Palin has vast \"executive experience.\" In reality world, this is a joke. And yes a governor has more responsibility. But even there Alaska is unique, because the presence of the oil revenues and the lack of a large poor population combine to virtually ensure that as long as out-and-out corruption is avoided, the state will always have the income to provide basic services.</p> <p>Third, <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/id/158738\">a fascinating Newsweek piece</a> on Palin's firing of her first police commissioner. In one of the few areas of actual responsibility she did have, she axed a seemingly competent cop in part because he thought letting citizens carry guns in bars <em>and schools</em> was a bad idea. Palin opposed him:</p> <blockquote> <p>Stambaugh, a former Anchorage police captain who once supervised Monegan, was hired as Wasilla's first police chief in 1993 and created the town's small police force, says former Wasilla mayor John Stein. But weeks after Palin beat Stein in 1996, she expressed displeasure with the chief. One big issue, Stambaugh said, was that he and other police chiefs had opposed a state-legislature bill to permit concealed weapons in schools and bars, which Stambaugh called \"craziness.\" But Palin, elected with backing from the National Rifle Association, which lobbied for the bill, told him she was \"not happy\" with his position, and that the NRA wanted him fired, says Stambaugh. Palin told him he \"shouldn't have done that,\" Stambaugh told Newsweek. (Palin denied in a deposition that the NRA contacted her about the weapons bill.)</p> <p>An even bigger clash involved a proposed city ordinance backed by Stambaugh to close the town bars at 2 a.m. instead of 5. Stambaugh says he believed this would help curb late-night drunken driving at a time when, according to Stein, the former mayor, \"people were driving out from Anchorage to the valley for more alcohol and crashing.\" But Palin, as a council member, had voted against the measure\u2014making her the favored candidate among bar owners, one of whom held a fund-raiser for her. Records obtained by NEWSWEEK show that Wasilla bar owners contributed $1,250 to her mayoral campaign\u2014more than 10 percent of all the money she raised in 1996. Griffin did not respond to requests for comment on those contributions.</p> </blockquote> <p>Fourth, the Wall Street Journal <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122143893857134389.html\">reports</a> today, in light of McCain's comments last Friday that Palin had sought no earmarks as governor, that that is just a flat-out lie:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>Last week, Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain said his running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, hadn't sought earmarks or special-interest spending from Congress, presenting her as a fiscal conservative. But state records show Gov. Palin has asked U.S. taxpayers to fund $453 million in specific Alaska projects over the past two years.</p> <p>These projects include more than $130 million in federal funds that would benefit Alaska's fishing industry and an additional $9 million to help Alaska oil companies. She also has sought $4.5 million to upgrade an airport on a Bering Sea island that has a year-round population of less than 100.</p> </blockquote> <p>If all this is true, why is she so popular? Fair question. She's likeable, as I said. She sold the airplane (which is something you can only do once). She taxed the oil companies and gave the money to the people. And she operates in secrecy, shiedling the bad news, which is a pretty easy thing for a governor in a small state with a small in-state media to do. As the governor said herself, it's not rocket science. Let's hope the US media stays on top of it.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337623618\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>The Zimbabwean president, Robert Mugabe, and the opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, today shook hands perfunctorily after signing an agreement to share power that could be the prelude to western financial help for the country's wrecked economy.</p> <p>The two arch-rivals and the leader of a breakaway opposition faction, Arthur Mutambara, signed documents at the main Harare convention centre on an occasion marked by pomp and ceremony, although Mugabe and Tsvangirai for the most part were unsmiling.</p> <p>In a sign of the changing times, Tsvangirai - who will become prime minister under the deal - addressed the dignitaries first after the signing rather than Mugabe. He appealed for unity among Zimbabweans and for help from the international community to rebuild the country.</p> <p>\"Let us not be divided by the past but united in the hope for the future,\" Tsvangirai said in a speech frequently punctuated by cheers and applause. He left until the end of his address to mention Mugabe, saying he was extending the hand that had signed the power-sharing agreement to the president.</p> <p>Tsvangirai said he had chosen to be driven by hope rather than past wrongs, and spoke of the need for accountability over past abuses.</p> <p>\"We must forget past hardships,\" he said. \"We must remember the sacrifices of our colleagues. Only in the acknowledgment of past wrongs can we begin the process of national healing.\"</p> <p>Mugabe sought to link today's event to Zimbabwe's independence struggle in the 1970s. \"This gathering is a re-enactment in my view of that togetherness, the partnership, the cooperation,\" that eventually led to independence for African countries, he said.</p> <p>The two men pledged to make the deal work even as violence broke out among rival supporters outside the convention centre. As the signing ceremony ended, stones were thrown and police fired warning shots and set dogs on the crowd.</p> <p>Several hundred people broke through the gates into the centre's sprawling grounds. Police closed the barriers and struggled to contain both those inside and outside.</p> <p>The signing took place after short introductions by the king of Swaziland, Mswati III, and Thabo Mbeki, the South African president, who brokered the agreement. In a ceremony designed to show an African approach to solving an African crisis, leaders from across the continent gathered to see what could be the changing of the guard after Mugabe's long reign.</p> <p>The deal was the culmination of three months of difficult negotiations by Mbeki at the behest of the Southern African Development Community. Mbeki arrived today with his foreign affairs minister, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, and Sydney Mufamadi, a cabinet minister who has led the negotiations.</p> <p>The agreement, which has yet to be made public, describes the seizure of land owned by white farmers \u2013 a policy that dramatically deepened Zimbabwe's economic crisis - as irreversible and says Britain should compensate those whose land was taken.</p> <p>Britain said it would support the new government if it started to reverse the country's steep economic decline.</p> <p>\"We hope that the new government will now reverse the tragic policies and decline of recent years,\" the foreign secretary, David Miliband, said in a statement. \"The new government needs to start to rebuild the country. If it does so, Britain and the rest of the international community will be quick to support them.\"</p> <p>The EU welcomed the breakthrough, but its foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, said officials would probably wait until next month to consider lifting sanctions. The EU wants to see whether Mugabe really does cede power to the opposition.</p> <p>Under the broad outlines of the deal, Tsvangirai would become prime minister and would chair a council of ministers that supervised the cabinet. Mugabe's Zanu-PF party would have 15 cabinet seats, Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change 13, and a splinter MDC faction three seats.</p> <p>The opposition has demanded control of the police, while agreeing to allow Mugabe \u2013 who has been in power since independence in 1980 - to retain control of the military. Both the police and military have been blamed for state-orchestrated violence and torture of Mugabe's opponents.</p> <p>Some critics who wanted Mugabe to surrender power completely have complained that the deal does not go far enough and creates a complicated arrangement that Mugabe could exploit, especially given the tension that exists between the two opposition factions.</p> <p>Mugabe, who once said the MDC would never rule Zimbabwe, and Tsvangirai have been enemies for a decade. Tsvangirai has been jailed, beaten, tortured and tried on treason charges that were dismissed in court.</p> <p>The sheer scale of Zimbabwe's economic meltdown forced the two men to the negotiating table. The country has by far the world's highest official inflation rate, at 11 million per cent. Independent financial institutions put the real inflation figure closer to 40 million per cent and rising daily.</p> <p>Zanu-PF and MDC negotiators met early today to discuss how to allocate the 31 ministries. Names of individuals to head the ministries are likely to be announced later in the week, a government official said.</p> <p>There would also be a national security council, replacing a joint operations command comprising security service chiefs who the opposition say were instrumental in organising a violent campaign that returned Mugabe to power.</p>",
  "<p>Lehman Brothers employees in London and New York today described how many staff, some in tears, had already cleared their desks at the collapsed investment bank and and left the buildings. </p> <p>Some were swiftly on the phone to headhunters, as other polished up their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. In New York, tourists gathered outside Lehman's offices on 7th Avenue to take snaps as shocked employees left the building carrying boxes of personal possessions. Others headed to the company's cafeteria to use up remaining credit on their canteen cards.</p> <p>In London, one member of staff told how some of his colleagues had been in tears as news of the firm's demise had filtered through. Another described how staff were \"finishing up\", swapping contact details and boxing their belongings before going home.</p> <p>Graduate trainee Jack Reynolds, who had been at the company for just one week, left the bank's European headquarters building in Canary Wharf, London, carrying a Lehman Brothers branded umbrella and rugby ball. </p> <p>\"My career has been screwed,\" he said. \"No one is happy. Everyone is upset and down but they've just got to get on with it.\" </p> <p>An internal communication was handed out to members of staff as they entered the building at Canary Wharf this morning. It read: \"Our email earlier today provided high-level information regarding recent changes impacting the firm. We will update you as soon as possible on these developments and their impact on the UK business. </p> <p>\"In the interim, it is important that we do not commit any financial obligations to third parties until the situation is clearer. Accordingly, no trades or other transactions may be entered into by members of staff today without prior clearance from a member of the Europe and Middle East operating committee. </p> <p>\"We realise this will contribute to the uncertainty in the short term but this is a necessary precaution to protect your interests and those of the firm.\"<br>Kirsty McCluskey, 32, who worked on Lehman's London trading floor, said her manager had promised her he would process her expenses. \"It is terrible. Death. It's like a massive earthquake,\" she told reporters. \"It's final. Everybody is just finishing up. I'll now try to move into another industry.\" </p> <p>Outside Lehman's worldwide headquarters in Midtown Manhattan this morning, tourists Harry and Jane Saunders were taking pictures of staff as they left the building. \"We just got off a transatlantic cruise, we live in Arizona, so we don't see things like this very often. And this is very sad, very sad.\"</p> <p>They put the blame on President Bush, but said: \"You can't expect the Federal Reserve to bail everybody out. We don't have enough money to bail everybody out.\" They said they felt they would be affected personally by the extraordinary events of the past few days: \"Let's put it this way. We just got off a transatlantic cruise, right, and we had two more already lined up. We may cancel.\"</p> <p>The collapse of Lehman Brothers, which has lost billions of dollars on risky mortgage-backed investments, followed the failure of rescue talks over the weekend. Its US parent subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection in America early today, with administrators being called into its European headquarters in London hours later.<br> In Britain, Lehman employs 4,000 staff in Canary Wharf. It also has an office in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, which is a subsidiary called Capstone Mortgage Services. </p> <p>As part of the UK administration, accountancy firm and administrator PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) said a number of Lehman group companies remained solvent and would continue to trade. These companies include Lehman Brothers Asset Management (Europe), as well as others which manage property portfolios and loans. </p> <p>Today, Duo Ai, 26, who worked in research, said the atmosphere inside the building at Canary Wharf was one of shock. He said: \"A lot of people are very sad. I heard someone was crying. I guess it's understandable if they invested a lot in Lehman stock. </p> <p>\"We really didn't see this coming. On Friday we were still holding out hope that some bank would buy Lehman. Everyone's understanding is that everyone is gone and everyone is clearing their desks. </p> <p>\"I couldn't sleep last night but stayed up talking about what was going to happen. The only question that remains is whether we will get this month's pay cheque.\" </p> <p>John Collins, 40, who works in equity derivatives product control, said he had been told not to come back tomorrow. \"People are trying to put a brave face on it but obviously there are some disconsolate people in there who have taken it very badly,\" he said. \"They say the economy is in its worst position since the 1920s. And they could be right. It's only the guys at the top who really know what's happening.\" </p> <p>In New York, Lehman workers also complained about lack of information. \"We're not trading and we're just kind of waiting to hear,\" said one worker in fixed income. \"We have gone straight to acceptance. We have gone through the stages of grief - there is not much you can do about it. People are getting their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s together but it is not the best time to be looking for a job in financial services. But you do what you have to do. It was quick. It surprised me. But that is the pace of finance these days. Things can go that quickly they are so very highly leveraged.</p> <p>\"My opinion is that Dick Fuld probably held on too long - if something had happened a few months ago, we could probably have survived or we could have been acquired instead of going bankrupt.\"</p> <p>But it was \"surprisingly calm,\" said one technology worker on the trading floors.\"People are kind of joking. Somebody said he was hoping he would get back a suit that somebody borrowed and never returned. </p> <p>\"It is obviously not a good place to be. But there is no crying or anything like that. Everybody is kind of being really strong about it. It has been getting worse and worse for so many months. I think we had a lot of hope over the weekend but by Sunday, people were saying, it looks like it is game over. Kind of a slow realisation, you know. </p> <p>\"We have had nothing at all about when they will put us in the picture. If you didn't know what was going on, and you went on some of the trading floors, you wouldn't see anything unusual, guys are standing, guys are talking, guys are at their computers.\"</p> <p>Most had turned up for work, said a Lehman IT worker. \"People are in neutral and they are clearing things out. There is a bit of desk clearing going on; there has been desk clearing going since the weekend. There is some disbelief at the speed at which this happened.\"</p> <p>A trader, asked what his plans were, replied: \"What am I going to do? Try and find a job. I am not at all confident in the current markets but you do what you can.\"</p>",
  "<p>As it reels from what the former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan described as a \"probably once-in-a-century type of event\", Wall Street may well be ruing the day when banking authorities acceded to its demands for wholesale deregulation of the banking sector.</p> <p>New regulation of the US financial sector seems likely once the dust settles on the financial turmoil that has seen Lehman Brothers, America's fourth-biggest investment bank, go to the wall, and the once mighty Merrill Lynch being rescued by the Bank of America.</p> <p>The Republican presidential candidate, John McCain, has already said that the crisis sweeping Lehman Brothers and other financial firms is a sign that banking regulations need an overhaul. Should that come to pass, it will mean turning back the clock.</p> <p>Beginning in the 1980s or earlier, the US banking sector lobbied Washington to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act, a statute that had been on the books since the 1930s. Glass-Steagall was part of a package of banking reforms put in place by president Franklin D Roosevelt to restore trust in the banking system.</p> <p>After the Great Crash of 1929, Wall Street was vilified for misleading the masses. Congress introduced legislation that diluted the power of big financial institutions, splitting up commercial and investment banking into separate functions. According to the act, commercial banks were not allowed to use depositors' money to finance profit-making investments other than loans.</p> <p>But the US banking sector argued that Glass-Steagall was hampering its ability to compete with rivals in Europe and Asia, which were increasing in size through a series of mergers. US banks put pressure on Congress to deregulate so they could use complex financial instruments that held out the promise of higher financial rewards.</p> <p>The other argument for deregulation was that customers would be able to buy financial products from one company. This one-stop shop, the banks argued, would allow them to make more money by cross-selling their products to customers. While banking lobbyists piled on the pressure in the corridors of Congress, the US banking sector created facts on the ground.</p> <p>When Citibank completed its merger with Travelers in October 1998, the deal drove a coach and horses through Glass-Steagall. One year later, banking's equivalent of the Wall of Jericho came crashing down. In 1999, Glass-Steagall was repealed, together with the bank holding company, a mechanism that was introduced in 1956 and provided the basis for modern US banking.</p> <p>Glass-Steagall was replaced under the Clinton administration by the Gramm-Leach Financial Modernisation Act. This blurred the lines between the commercial banks that made their money through loans, and the more risky ventures of investment banks. The new bill ended the rules that limited the ability of banks to underwrite securities, which prevented them from engaging in new lines of business such as insurance.</p> <p>As Robert Kuttner, an economics expert, <a href=\"http://www.electionnews2008.com/glass-steagall-repeal-caused-subprime-disaster.htm\">testified before Congress</a> last year: </p> <p>\"Since repeal of Glass Steagall in 1999, after more than a decade of de facto inroads, super-banks have been able to re-enact the same kinds of structural conflicts of interest that were endemic in the 1920s \u2014 lending to speculators, packaging and securitising credits and then selling them off, wholesale or retail, and extracting fees at every step along the way. And much of this paper is even more opaque to bank examiners than its counterparts were in the 1920s.\"</p> <p>The repeal of Glass-Steagall coincided with low interest rates that put pressure on financial institutions to seek higher returns through more arcane financial instruments. Wall Street investment banks, with their appetite for risk, led the charge. </p> <p>Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers became heavily involved in property, underwriting billions in mortgage-backed securities and investing in commercial property. Bear Stearns had the fortune to be rescued by JP Morgan from its ill-fated foray into the sub-prime market. </p> <p>Not so Lehman. In the UK, Northern Rock came a cropper by borrowing money to fund its loans and mortgages. When borrowing dried up because of the credit crunch, the Rock had to be bailed out by the Bank of England.</p> <p>US banks \u2014 particularly investment banks \u2014 are in difficulty because they were granted what they wished for. Left to their own devices, several have managed to ruin themselves and create havoc in the international financial system. Wall Street bankers may be wishing that regulators had kept them on a tighter leash, not least because fewer of them would be out of a job today.</p>",
  "<p>As the Republicans edge ahead in the US Presidential election, Barack Obama's people have tried to puncture their balloon using one line of attack more than most. For all John McCain and Sarah Palin's repeated claims that \"Washington isn't working\", doesn't the fact that their party has been in control \u2013 of both the presidency and Congress \u2013 for most of the last eight years rather undermine their credibility? Ergo the charge that they're \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/04/opinion/04thu1.html?incamp=article_popular\">running against themselves</a>\", a buzz-phrase whose potency is highlighted when you Google it: at the last count, it brought up just over a million and a half results.</p> <p>The same words came to mind when I heard about the ringleaders of the current ragtag anti-Brown revolt. Siobhain McDonagh boasts of never having voted against the government; as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/15/gordonbrown.labour\">Mark Seddon</a> points out elsewhere on Cif, Joan Ryan has long been in the habit of \"ritually denouncing\" anyone who wants to question the New Labour script. The fact that some of them have put in spells as junior ministers might conceivably be raised in their defence, but nonetheless, a quick visit to <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/\">Theyworkforyou.com</a> fleshes out the profiles of such sudden insurrectionists as George Howarth, Greg Pope, Janet Anderson, Jim Dowd and Barry Gardiner: all of them voted for the introduction of ID cards, foundation hospitals, top-up fees, the replacement of Trident and the Iraq war. The fact that they've been joined by looser cannons such as as Graham Stringer, Gordon Prentice and that hard-left desperado John McDonnell (who has surely managed his own version of the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact) doesn't alter the revolt's fundamentals: politically, its prime movers are stuck on exactly the same page as the PM they want to topple.</p> <p>In that context, their explanation for their volte-face are inevitably rather contorted. As far as I'm aware, McDonagh and Ryan \u2013 by far the most visible plotters, to date at least \u2013 have gone on endlessly about the need for a change of \"direction\", without even beginning to detail what that actually mean. Howarth has a go in this morning's <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/george-howarth-why-we-need-a-leadership-contest-930879.html\">Independent</a>, and it is not pretty: \"We must take control and confront the problems that now face us,\" he says, daringly. \"We have to explain what sort of country we want Britain to be in a way that resonates with the public. We need a story that tells how our progressive principles translate into policies that help ordinary people.\" The rest passes in a haze of grey New Labourspeak: by way of a vision, he offers not much more than a picture of \"individuals, families and society working together to be the best we can be\".</p> <p>His most priceless line, however, is the claim that Labour has to act fast to \"rebuild the support we have lost over the last year\". Not that one wants to sound too withering, but really: between the elections of 1997 and 2005 \u2013 that is, prior to the last 12 months \u2013 Labour lost no less than 4.5 million voters. The fact that neither its core support nor millions of floating voters seem to have much of a clue about what Labour now stands for is a malaise that took root long ago, when Blair was merrily trashing Labour orthodoxy and most of the rebels were dutifully applauding. Brown's problems have been twofold: a chronically dysfunctional approach to administration and PR, for sure, but also his refusal to consider the kind of social-democratic moves that the times demand (on this score, needless to say, his refusal to go near a windfall tax on the energy companies speaks volumes), and use rhetoric more convincing than the washed-out stuff of New Labourism. One thinks of a comment from a voter heard during the Crewe and Nantwich byelection: \"We thought he'd be different from Blair, and he's exactly the same.\"</p> <p>The only revolt worth taking seriously \u2013 and one that, needless to say, has yet to materialise \u2013 would be one built on an intelligent understanding of the essentials of Labour's current predicament: the fact that, as such well-known lefties as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/14/marketturmoil.economics\">Will Hutton</a> have lately been pointing out, the terms of politics and economics are changing at speed, and articles of faith minted in the mid-1990s will no longer do the business. The September plotters \u2013 and, indeed, the outer ring of anti-Brownites whose nebulous critique is <a href=\"http://www.progressives.org.uk/Magazine/article.asp?a=3351\">here</a> \u2013 apparently have nothing to offer beyond more of the same. It's true: to all intents and purposes, they are running against themselves.</p>",
  "<p>Just after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/12/poland.law\">General Jaruzelski</a> declared martial law, graffitti appeared at Warsaw train station which said: \"General, perhaps history will absolve you, but I'm going to get you. Micky.\" I felt the same. I spent time in prison back then. There where two kinds of communists on our side of the iron curtain: those who shot and those who were shot at. For us, the reds, brought up at state universities, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/picture_gallery/05/europe_solidarity_in_poland0/html/1.stm\">Solidarity</a> was first of all the workers movement. In a country ruled by the Polish United Workers party, we saw for the first time in our lives workers speaking, attending rallies, arguing and voting, electing their representatives. Factory striking committees sent delegates to umbrella committees and from there on to the national striking committee. This was a workers' democracy that resembled that of the Soviets in the early days of the Bolshevik revolution. For 16 months this strange sociopolitical movement based on strikes co-governed a huge state that was part of the Soviet bloc. We called it \"The Carnival\". </p> <p>Jaruzelski put tanks on the streets, justifying his actions with the slogan: \"We are going to defend socialism, just as we do the independence of the country\". But it was completely wrong. OK, he had a difficult choice. If he didn't shoot at Polish workers he would supposedly have had to shoot at Russian tanks. But though our independence might have been in danger, socialism, which was under the workers' control, wasn't. At the end of the day it was the former Communist party apparatchiks who most were the most eager purveyors of barbaric capitalism in Poland. And the transition went so smoothly because Jaruzelski had done the dirty work of crushing Solidarity, the only force which could have saved socialism or even created a new, democratic form of it. </p> <p>Now, the great hope is over. It is not exciting to be Polish any more. The opposition and communist elites made a deal over people's heads. They traded free lunches at factory canteens for everyone for brunches at the Marriott hotel for those who betrayed their comrades (in the case of Solidarity) and their ideology (in the case of party members). Balcerowicz's neoliberal <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balcerowicz_Plan\">shock therapy</a> took more lives than martial law. The rate of suicides due to unemployment, poverty and evictions has risen dramatically. Ironically, Jaruzelski is responsible for both martial law and capitalism. He paved the way for Balcerowicz, who also happened to be a former politburo lecturer. </p> <p>And now those who have made Poles work more hours than any other European nation, who have made 25% of Polish children go hungry (according to the latest EU report) are judging an old man who gave them a helping hand.</p> <p>I spoke to Jaruzelski in the early 1990s. It was a nice long chat between the former dictator and his political prisoner. He was indignant about his former party colleagues' behaviour, for example the draconian eviction law passed by the post-communist (Democratic Left Alliance) government. Most Poles have forgiven him and the vast majority perceive Jaruzelski as a national hero who saved us from a Soviet invasion.</p> <p>For me he is a dramatic figure. The world order created by Yalta taught Poles to pursue the lesser evil. Jaruzelski's choice was wrong but well-intentioned. Politicians, especially rightwing politicians, and especially President Kaczynski, want to rewrite history. They call it \"historical policy\". I hate it. They can't supply flats, healthcare, good jobs, pensions, decent wages. Instead they'll throw Jaruzelski to the mob. But nobody is buying it. Two million have already emigrated. People want a better life, not revenge.</p>",
  "<p>Last Tuesday, US Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi arrived 45 minutes late to a press conference that she had called. She finally showed up to talk about energy issues. Her party will allow a vote on legislation that would allow <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKN1019497620080911\">limited offshore oil exploration</a>. Of course, that bill will be larded with so many tax hikes and other provisions that Republicans (and some Democrats) find objectionable that it will go down to defeat by vote or by the president's veto pen.</p> <p>The only reason that Democrats, who control both houses of Congress, are even holding the vote is that they are spooked. In August, House Republicans protested that the majority party wouldn't hold a vote on allowing more energy exploration. Democrats responded by turning the House lights off on them. Yes, <a href=\"http://www.reason.com/blog/show/127930.html\">Reason magazine's David Weigel</a> wrote, \"this actually happened\".</p> <p>Voters tell pollsters that the issue is of great importance to them, and so Democratic presidential contender Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/01/AR2008080103199.html\">flipped</a> on the issue, though without much enthusiasm. At his <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2008/08/obama_we_are_a.html\">big speech at the Democratic convention</a>, he thought it necessary to explain that this was \"a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution\" to supplement his otherwise minty green approach to energy.</p> <p>Dems had thought that the issue could be dealt with easily, but they underestimated Republican enthusiasm. Most elected Democrats didn't want more exploration. Perhaps they were willing to grudgingly allow some \"stop-gap measure\" to go forward, but that was it. Then they encountered the Republican throngs chanting <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/opinion/15hahn.html\">\"Drill baby, drill!\"</a> What do they do now?</p> <p>They're not just discombobulated over drilling. Coming out of Denver, Democrats thought they had this election locked up. After all, serious gains in Congress were all but assured. Obama's much-lauded speech had been the <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2008/08/30/politics/horserace/entry4400853.shtml\">most-watched acceptance address of all time</a>, and it took place in a packed sports stadium with Greek columns in the backdrop. Democrats had a young, audacious candidate and were facing a party whose standard-bearer was crusty senior senator who was, by his own admission, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/POLITICS/blogs/politicalticker/2006/12/mccain-im-older-than-dirt.html\">\"older than dirt\"</a>.</p> <p>A week later, John McCain's speech was more watched than Obama's, and the post-convention polls gave the GOP a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigger\">Tigger</a>-sized bounce. Much attention has been paid to McCain's pick of Alaska governor Sarah Palin as his running mate, and there's no doubt that mattered a great deal. The relentless criticism of her before her speech and her combative response instantly turned her into a mix of right-wing darling and redneck folk hero.</p> <p>But Palin and drilling only part of a larger pattern of things that have gone right for the GOP lately. New York congressman and House ways and means committee chairman Charlie Rangel faces possible charges of tax evasion. President Bush announced a small drawdown of troops from Iraq. Rather than cheering this, Obama complained that the US government isn't putting more troops in Afghanistan, muddying his anti-war appeal at a time when he needs all the votes he can get. A new <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/110263/Battle-Congress-Suddenly-Looks-Competitive.aspx\">Gallup daily tracking poll</a> even found, implausibly, that Democratic control of Congress is starting to look doubtful.</p> <p>What's happening? Some political parties are good at cutting the governing party down to size in opposition, and modern Republicans are masters of this. They lost their narrow hold on Congress in the 2006 midterm elections, and they no longer feel it necessary to defend much of Bush's legacy.</p> <p>Even the war in Iraq is being spun as something that's nearly over. Palin praised US forces in Iraq \"who have now brought victory within sight\".

  "<p>If you're a parent, the chances are you're better informed about your mobile phone bills and bank statements than you are about your child's progress at school. These are the findings of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/feedarticle/7791490\">a recent survey</a> by <a href=\"http://www.becta.org.uk/\">Becta</a>, the education technology agency, which has also found that 85% of parents are given progress updates from their child's school just four times a year or less.</p> <p>Of course, it would be unfair to expect schools to keep up with the levels of communication offered by huge banks and mobile phone companies, who have deep coffers. Banks and schools serve very different purposes, and schools have complex information to communicate. But there's still something to be learned from the way technology is already being used in many different ways to make important information available at the click of a button. Why shouldn't schools do the same?<br><br>There is strong evidence to show that children do better at school when their parents talk to them about how they are doing and what they are learning. </p> <p>So if parents can be provided with timely and meaningful information about their children's school lives and work, it can help children to thrive. Over two-thirds of parents in Becta's survey said they would like schools to use technologies such as text messaging and the internet to communicate with them more frequently. Currently, only 8% of parents surveyed are kept informed using these methods. </p> <p>The demand is there, and parents are right to be asking for greater and more regular access to information relating to their children's development at school. But <a href=\"http://schools.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=oe&amp;catcode=ss_es_fam_onrep_03\">online reporting</a> is not about replacing or duplicating traditional methods of involving parents, such as parents' meetings or annual reports. It's about giving parents up-to-date information at appropriate points through the year, so they are aware of their children's attainment and progress, attendance, behaviour and special needs. It should help children to feel that their parents are involved and care about their achievements. It also means that you and your child can look at the work they have stored in their online school folder \u2013 even grandparents living far away can see the latest brilliant story or amazing artwork at the click of a mouse.</p> <p>So, the parents among us want more text and online updates. But what about the teachers? Already burdened with huge amounts of administrative work, some teachers might baulk at the idea of using an online reporting system that they believe will increase the amount of time spent out of the classroom.</p> <p>But the reality is different. Schools already using online reporting methods have noted that teachers spend less time in total producing three reports each year online than they did when producing just one by hand. The anytime, anywhere aspect of online reporting allows teachers to have greater control and flexibility of the use of their time. And, importantly, online reporting allows teachers to see the 'bigger picture' for each student because they are able to view grades and progress in other subjects.</p> <p>Technology is part of everyday life for us all. <a href=\"http://www.nextgenerationlearning.org.uk/\">It's time we took advantage of its benefits</a> in our schools and for our children.</p> <p>\u0095 Dr Tanya Byron is a child consultant with expertise in technology issues, and author of the <a href=\"http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/byronreview/\">Byron review</a> for the Department of Children, Schools and Families</p>",
  "<p>The Jetalliance pairing of Karl Wendlinger and Ryan Sharp took their third victory of the season at the Czech circuit of Brno yesterday, as they bid to get their FIA GT Championship campaign back on track.</p> <p>The Aston Martin DBR9 drivers missed the last round, held on the streets of Bucharest, but returned in fine form by taking pole position in Saturday's qualifying session. Starting the race, Wendlinger maintained the lead and pulled clear of a first-lap clash that wiped out four cars, with the DBR9 going on to cross the line eight seconds ahead of the second-placed Phoenix Carsport Corvette Z06 of Mike Hezemans and Fabrizio Gollin. Hezemans' car had survived early accident damage and he snatched the runners-up slot on the last lap from the SRT Corvette pairing of Christophe Bouchut and Xavier Maassen, who finished in third place.</p> <p>\"We showed this weekend once more that we are competitive, as we have all year long,\" said Wendlinger. \"Everything fell together for this race - we had good free practices to set up the car, then qualifying went well too. It's been a very good race, the car has handled very well, it was very consistent and it allowed us to push at the end of the race. I had things under control; I didn't have to go over the limit, just drive as fast as possible.\"</p> <p>Sharp added: \"The last two races have been a bit disappointing, so to bounce back we have to win as many races as possible to try and get back into a good championship position by the end of the season.\"</p> <p>In the GT2 class, victory went to the AF Corse pairing of Toni Vilander and Gianmaria Bruni, who extended their championship lead by avoiding an accident in their Ferrari 430.</p> <p>\"In the beginning I managed to pass Dirk [Muller] and [Emmanuel] Collard going in to turn one,\" said Bruni, \"but when I started braking a CRS car went into the back of a GT1 car; I avoided that accident and just pushed really hard for my 15 laps and tried to get a good gap. My stint was very nice, and the car went well. I don't mind getting the extra weight back at Nogaro [the next race] as it will get rid of the understeer, which I hate.\"</p>",
  "<p>Launching a classical music download store is a very brave, or perhaps foolhardy, thing to do. While kids shell out loadsamoney for ringtones, classical music buyers tend to be pernickety about recordings, and careful with their money, as <a href=\"http://www.passionato.com/\">Passionato</a> may soon discover.</p> <p>Passionato is a straightforward site offering classical music albums at decent quality but not at low prices. Typically, albums cost \u00a37.99 for 320kbps MP3 versions and \u00a38.99 for lossless Flac, though some cost \u00a34/\u00a35, and there are tracks at 79p/99p. Tracks are mercifully free of DRM (digital rights management) copy protection, so you can play them on anything, including iPods.</p> <p>You can browse Passionato's catalogue by Composers, Artists, Genres/Periods or Record Labels. The labels include EMI, Naxos, Chandos, and BBC Worldwide. Deutsche Grammophon isn't listed, but there are lots of DG albums inexplicably hidden under Universal Classics &amp; Jazz.</p> <p>The navigation doesn't always work. Looking for the sublime Alison Balsom, for example, I went to Artist, Instrumentalist, and clicked Trumpet, but she's not in the 76 results or its alphabetical listing. A global search for Balsom finds three albums, which is OK, but searching for Lang Lang finds hundreds because the hits include the \"Sung Language\" subheading, Jean Langlais, Nadia Boulanger etc. \"Lang Lang\" in quotes gets no results. Did no one test this thing?</p> <p>Really there should be an Advanced Search facility so you can specify composer, work, orchestra etc. It would be uniquely better if you could also specify things like modern or period instruments: we can dream!</p> <p>The site also has sections for new releases (Critic's Choice), a chart and special offers \u2013 sign on and you get 10 free tracks.</p> <p>Currently, Passionato doesn't have a deep enough catalogue or enough musical information. The catalogue ultimately depends on all the music majors signing up and making \"out of print\" recordings available. Ideally, for example, I want all four of Karajan's great Beethoven cycles, a choice of the original or remastered versions, and a guide to the differences. Passionato just has the remastered 1961-62 set and a couple of quotes.</p> <p>Full background information is probably not affordable unless you crowdsource it by providing a wiki or \u2013 as Amazon does \u2013 user reviews. Passionato has neither.</p> <p>But the biggest problem is money: if you find something you want, will you buy it?</p> <p>Take, for example, the Bach concertos played by Hilary Hahn. Passionato wants \u00a37.99 for the 320kbps MP3 version. However, go to Amazon.co.uk and you can buy a new CD for less (\u00a36.23 plus \u00a31.24 shipping from Caiman USA) and rip it yourself. Which I did, ages ago. </p> <p>At Amazon.com, the MP3 version (256kbps) costs $8.99, and individual tracks cost 89c instead of 99p. For those who enjoyed the controversial Russian site AllOfMP3.com, MP3sparks.com offers the same download for $2.38 at 192kbps, with tracks at between 14c and 28c. And, of course, popular stuff like this circulates for free on file-sharing networks.</p> <p>Given the scale of the market challenge, one has to wish Passionato luck. It will need it.</p>",

It has 11 UK offices, including ones at Croydon, Reading, Bristol, Manchester and Glasgow. AIG operates under three main brands in the UK - AIG UK, AIG Life and AIG Direct. However, it also sells insurance through high street brands, such as Argos and Boots, while the firm underwrites product warrantees for retailer John Lewis.</p> <p>AIG saw its former boss, British-born Martin Sullivan, quit in June after a 36-year association with the insurer. Sullivan, who was raised in Dagenham, Essex and joined AIG as a 17-year-old clerk in the company's London office, ended his three-year tenure at the helm after facing calls to quit from shareholders.</p> <p>He had overseen writedowns and losses of over $30bn, leading his predecessor and AIG's largest shareholder, Maurice Greenberg, to speak out against him.

  "<p>Electronic Arts has finally ended its pursuit of rival Take-Two Interactive, ending a seven-month attempt to buy the publisher of Grand Theft Auto. </p> <p>California-based EA, the world's biggest games publisher, had made an initial $26 a share takeover bid in February, valuing its rival at more than $2bn. But after being spurned by the board of Take-Two on several occasions, executives announced yesterday that a deal was no longer a possibility.</p> <p>In a statement, Electronic Arts said that it retained \"high regard\" for its rival, but that talks had come to an end.</p> <p>\"After careful consideration \u2013 including a management presentation and review of other due diligence materials \u2013 EA has decided not to make a proposal to acquire Take-Two and has terminated discussions,\" it said.</p> <p>Take-Two chairman Strauss Zelnick responded with a statement repeating his claim that EA's approach significantly undervalued the New York-based company.</p> <p>\"We remain focused on creating value for our stockholders and our consumers,\" he said. \"This has been our goal since EA launched its conditional and unsolicited bid six months ago, a bid which was repeatedly rejected by our stockholders.\"</p> <p>Although Take-Two is responsible for a number of popular games including BioShock and the Midnight Club racing series, it is best known as the publisher of the blockbuster Grand Theft Auto series.</p> <p>That game, produced by its subsidiary Rockstar and originally created in Scotland, is one of the industry's biggest titles and has become massively popular for its realistic environments \u2013 as well as notorious for its adult themes. When the latest instalment was released in April, it sold nearly 6m copies in its first week, grossing more than $500m.</p> <p>EA executives believed they could sell more copies of Take-Two's other games, as well as adding GTA to their existing stable of blockbuster titles \u2013 including The Sims, sports franchises such as Fifa Soccer and recently-released evolution simulator Spore.</p> <p>However, they could have waited too long to make an approach. Take-Two looked riped for acquisition 18 months ago, when former CEO Ryan Brant pleaded guilty to falsifying business records. But it has strengthened its hand since Zelnick took control of the company in a boardroom coup in March 2007. </p> <p>Ben Feder, the company's chief executive, made reference to that turnaround when responding to the news yesterday.</p> <p>\"Take-Two's business has continued to strengthen since the time EA first made its offers,\" he said. \"We are confident in the unique value of our business given our strong position in what is a growing and dynamic industry.\"</p> <p>The company also confirmed that it was still in talks with \"strategic partners\", rumoured to include American media conglomerate Viacom.</p>",
  "<p>The police ANPR database, which the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/15/civilliberties.police\">Guardian today reveals</a> will retain information from 50 million road journeys a day for five years, is a system that was never sanctioned or debated in parliament and which threatens the freedom of movement, assembly and protest.<br> Presented simply as a tool to fight crime and terror by the police, it will become one of the cornerstones of the surveillance state, and will give the police far too much power to track, in real time, the movement of people who may be bound for legitimate demonstrations and protest rallies. Linked with the <a href=\"http://www.commonsleader.gov.uk/output/page2461.asp\">government's proposals</a> to <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/scitech/2008/09/data-citizens-government-imp\">seize all our communications data</a> to be announced in the Queen's speech this autumn, this move signifies a profound change in our society and an irreversible transfer of power from free individuals to the state.<br> It is not difficult to imagine how the system will be used in times of industrial and political strife. We have already seen how police prevented legitimate demonstration during the first years of the Iraq war and have illegally obstructed protests against the arms trade, and are currently harassing accredited press photographers going about their legitimate business. These are hints of what will come when the police can track the movement of all vehicles, particularly if harsher economic times are accompanied by unrest. The revelations in the Guardian today come from <a href=\"http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/?gclid=CNuIws3p3ZUCFRdqQgodNVbJYA\">freedom of information requests</a> made to the Home Office. In this context it is important to know that the dealings and discussions in Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), which has been largely responsible for pushing the ANPR system, remain hidden from public scrutiny. Because Acpo has limited company status and is not a public body, it does not have to comply with freedom of information laws.<br> Police officers keep on insisting that these powers will not be abused, but revelations made by another FOI request last week show that the police use surveillance techniques to bully and harass citizens. In Wales, a team of 11 officers took part in a surveillance operation against a 49-year-old police dog handler who claimed he was suffering from depression, a fact established by the Police Medical Appeal Board. Officers from two forces watched his home for months and filmed him at a cost of \u00a3100,000. If the police have such little regard for the rights and privacy of one of their own, it's difficult to imagine that they will treat the public with any more respect. The surveillance of all journeys is a very serious move indeed and it tells us a lot about how far Labour has advanced a state of total and unwavering surveillance; and also how little parliament has done to protect our rights. It seems incredible that the great issues of control and privacy that are obviously involved in the ANPR system were never discussed in parliament. That a secretive and unaccountable organisation like ACPO can press ahead behind parliament's back is a measure of our failed politics, at the very least of the failure of mechanisms of restraint and scrutiny. In these days of enormous daily distractions \u2013 of freakish weather, banks failing and general economic turbulence \u2013 it is difficult to concentrate on the programme to convert Britain into a totally controlled and watched state. But we can all be sure that it is happening under our noses. The penny has dropped with the Trades Union Congress, which will surely have much to say about the possibility of police watching and intercepting those on their way to take part in legitimate industrial action and protest. Last week the TUC voted to resist the ID card scheme and consider legal action to uphold civil liberties. The move came after aviation workers \u2013 among the first group to be compelled to register for ID cards \u2013 placed a motion before congress. The motion states: </p> <blockquote> <p>Congress sees absolutely no value in the scheme or in improvements to security that might flow from this exercise and feels that aviation workers are being used as pawns in a politically led process which might lead to individuals being denied the right to work because they are not registered or chose not to register in the scheme.</p> </blockquote> <p><br> This represents a considerable victory for reason and democracy, and the important part is that the vote was not carried simply because the ID card might deny people the right to work. Broader civil liberties considerations were at the heart of this debate. With parliament dead from the neck up when it comes to issues of liberty, it is difficult to know how the ANPR surveillance and the equally important proposal to seize data concerning all phone calls, text messages and internet connections, can be resisted. But resist we must if we are to save our free society.</p>",
  "<p>The new conventional wisdom at Westminster is that the Conservatives are heading for an overall majority at the next election, and that the Liberal Democrats are therefore bound to take a pounding. On this view, the Lib Dems' fortunes are inextricably linked with Labour and we are supposed to lose seats as we did when the Conservatives won in 1951, 1970 and 1979.</p> <p>I don't believe a word of it. After each Liberal Democrat advance \u2013 in 1997, 2001 and 2005 \u2013 the commentariat has written our obituary. But each time we went on to increase our seats at the next election. We can and will do the same again.</p> <p>The politics, the party and the electoral arithmetic are all fundamentally different to the previous periods of Labour-to-Tory swing. Unlike 1979, we are not associated with the <a href=\"http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/item_single.php?item_id=77&amp;item=history\">Lib-Lab pact</a> propping up an unpopular Labour government, or the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A2430091\">Thorpe scandal</a>.</p> <p>Unlike the six MPs we had in both 1951 and 1970, we are now major political players with 63. We have a fifth of all councilors, and control big cities such as Liverpool, Newcastle and Sheffield. Our poll ratings have recovered since the beginning of the leadership contest, when they averaged 13%. We have recently averaged 17%, better than at the same time of the electoral cycle in two of the past three parliaments. It is a good platform from which to make our usual advance during an election campaign when the media have to give us fair time.</p> <p>The seductive danger of the conventional wisdom is that it was right once. The Liberal Democrats' electoral battlegrounds used to be overwhelmingly with the Conservatives, even after 1997. All that has changed, which is why Nick Clegg recently announced a new targeting strategy to go after 50 Labour seats. As Professor John Curtice pointed out in his analysis of the 2005 election, there is now a big electoral battlefield with Labour. We won 12 Labour seats in 2005, and can now win many more. We can now make gains from both Labour and the Tories.</p> <p>Look at the electoral arithmetic of the <a href=\"http://www.election-maps.co.uk/index.jsp\">new boundaries</a>, and make the <a href=\"http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/878\">conventional assumption</a> that the Tories win an overall majority. They would have achieved a 6.9% swing from Labour, nearly half as large again as what is hitherto the biggest postwar swing to the Conservatives of 5.3%, in 1979. Such a big swing seems unlikely given that 1979 saw the winter of discontent, rubbish in the streets and corpses unburied.</p> <p>But let's play the swingometer game. A narrow overall majority of one for the Tories \u2013 if the Lib Dem vote stays the same \u2013 would mean Tory gains of 116 seats. But the net effect on the Lib Dems, if the same swing were repeated uniformly in every seat, would be a loss of five seats. We would win 57 seats instead of 62 last time.</p> <p>This is not, though, the end of the story. We would have arrived at this position by winning eight seats from Labour, and losing 13 seats to the Tories. But would we? This fails to take into account our track record of defending our turf once we win it.</p> <p>The Nuffield general election study said: \"The party for whom the personal popularity of their incumbent appeared to matter most, however, was, as in previous elections, the Liberal Democrat party.\" The Lib Dem incumbency factor was worth an average of 6.6% of the vote in 2005.</p> <p>Out of the 13 Lib Dem seats that the Tories would in theory win if they got an overall majority \u2013 including my own Eastleigh seat \u2013 five are being defended for the first time by new MPs who can expect the \"incumbency bounce\" to lift them out of danger. We would also win another seat nominally lost to the Tories due to boundary changes.</p> <p>Because we have younger MPs, there is only one new seat that is more vulnerable because of a retiring incumbent. Even if we lost there, overall Tory gains from us would be cut from 13 to 8. Add back the gains from Labour and we would have the same number of MPs.</p>",
  "<p>The wisest words to come out of the Middle East for a long time were <a href=\"http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1015408.html\">spoken recently</a> by Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas: \"We shouldn't lose another seven years searching for solutions.\" But as hard as it is to disagree with the insight that the seven years that have passed since Israelis and Palestinians last attempted to negotiate a peace agreement in Taba in 2001 were lost and wasted, it is clear that optimism about the current Israeli-Palestinian negotiations is in short supply. Few people believe that the ambitious goal that was set last autumn in Annapolis \u2013 to produce an agreement by the end of this year \u2013 is realistic. Yet, in his recent statements, Abbas seemed to reject the widely held view that the negotiations were futile. He emphasised that the talks \"haven't been for nothing,\" adding: \"We would have stopped it if it was pointless. There are benefits that I hope will show in the future.\" </p> <p>What these benefits might be is anyone's guess, though there is certainly no shortage of speculation in the Israeli media about what is being offered, rejected and negotiated <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1221142471485&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull\">behind closed doors</a>. </p> <p>And while there have been tantalising hints that \"Israel and the Palestinian Authority are <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1018533.html\">closer than ever</a> to a peace deal\", statements that stress the gaps that remain between the two sides are clearly much more frequent. </p> <p>Given the fact that last weekend marked the 15th anniversary of the Oslo Accords, it is indeed high time to make a determined effort to finally bridge these gaps, as the Palestinian president rightly emphasised in <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1020725.html\">an interview</a> he gave to Ha'aretz on that occasion. Early on in the interview, Abbas also emphasised another point which is of crucial importance, even though the media have so far shown surprisingly little interest in related developments: referring to the performance of the Palestinian security forces, he proudly noted that \"even senior Israeli officials now admit that we are doing an excellent job\".</p> <p>Indeed, Israeli officials do admit that \u2013 and the implications should not be underestimated: as <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1021014.html\">Avi Issacharoff</a> argues in Ha'aretz, the impressive performance of the Palestinian security forces means that it is time for Israeli security officials to re-evaluate their dismissive views of the reliability of Palestinian commitments to build a state willing and capable to enforce law and order and rein in the forces opposed to a peace agreement with Israel. A previous <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1009578.html\">Ha'aretz article</a> highlighted that it is largely due to US support that the very important efforts to reform the Palestinian security forces are starting to bear fruit. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the responsible US official, General Keith Dayton, is helping to lay the foundations for a Palestinian state \u2013 and it is certainly encouraging to read that Dayton \"is confident his endeavour will succeed\". </p> <p>Issacharoff describes the achievements of the Palestinian security forces in fairly dramatic terms:</p> <blockquote> <p>A new security reality has been developing in the West Bank in recent months ... The chaos that once reigned in the West Bank's cities, villages and refugee camps has vanished, replaced by newly invigorated Palestinian security forces. In the 14 months since Hamas' takeover of the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian Authority has managed to revive a concept almost unknown to residents of the territories in recent years: law and order.</p> </blockquote> <p>What is perhaps no less interesting than these developments themselves is the fact that Issacharoff feels there is reason to criticise the \"media's failure to highlight the change\". As far as the Israeli media are concerned, this criticism is actually not entirely fair: Ha'aretz featured the already mentioned report on General Dayton about a month ago; and <a href=\"http://www.peacenow.org/mepr.asp?rid=&amp;cid=5314\">recent news reports</a> have duly noted that Israeli security officials are acknowledging a \"marked improvement\" in the performance of the Palestinian security forces. </p> <p>Yet, it is arguably worthwhile to ask whether entrenched views, formed during the long-running conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, have come to function as blinders that obscure a new and different reality: a Palestinian state in the making, led by dedicated politicians who are firmly committed to achieving a negotiated two-state solution \u2013 and the seriousness of this commitment is also reflected in the willingness of the Palestinian president to openly express appreciation for his Israeli negotiation partner and the support of the US.</p>",

  "<p>Pakistani forces have fired on US troops near the Afghan border, stopping them from entering a remote north-western region of the country, local security officials said today.</p> <p>According to reports, US helicopters landed on the Afghan side of the border at about midnight.

  "<p>Expectation can be a wonderful thing. Some people book their holidays a year in advance and savour the anticipatory excitement for months. In my household, it's theatre tickets. Like hundreds of others <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/sep/12/shakespeare.theatre\">who queued last week for tickets</a>, we're counting down the days to the David Tennant Hamlet at the Novello, and already have the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/sep/11/theatrenews.film\">Jude Law Hamlet</a> tickets in the bag for July 2009, which gives a full 10 months of feverish anticipation. Well, maybe in the case of Law it will be a case of indulging in hope over experience, although I thought he was pretty good in 'Tis Pity She's a Whore, even if the young <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_Best\">Eve Best</a> was better.</p> <p>But just as too much expectation can create disappointment for holiday makers who turn up at their resort to discover that the hotel is not yet built and there is a sewerage plant next to the swimming pool, so it can swamp audiences too. Will we need family therapy if David Tennant calls in sick on December 27 and we get the understudy? What if he's not as good as the reviews have said? What if - and this is my youngest daughter's greatest fear -Shakespeare turns out to be a less able script writer than Doctor Who's Russell T Davies? How can Greg Doran's production possibly live up to our hopes after all the hype?<br><br>The shows I often enjoy most are not those that I've been looking forward to expectantly, but the ones that creep up and mug me unawares. I'll probably never see another Gregory Burke play, however good it is, that gives me quite the thrill of his first, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2001/aug/04/theatre.edinburghfestival2001\">Gagarin Way</a>, because it was so completely unexpected. Although I'm a massive fan of Enda Walsh's work, nothing - however brilliant - will ever quite recapture the open-mouthed excitement of his UK debut with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/aug/16/edinburghfestival2001.edinburghfestival\">Disco Pigs</a>. How will John Tiffany ever top Black Watch? What does it feel like to be David Tennant stepping out on that stage each night knowing that the audience is expecting to be blown away?</p> <p>With our constant emphasis on the new, I'm as guilty as the next critic of adding to the culture of expectation. The star ratings system doesn't help. Four- or five-star shows create an extra layer of expectation and increase the odds of disappointment, particularly for audiences travelling a long way or on tight budgets. On the other hand, the slew of three-star reviews for Lipsynch last week make the show look like a failure. But as contributors to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2008/sep/08/lepageslipsynchisntthereal\">Maxie Szalwinska's blog</a> about Robert Lepage's Lipsynch pointed out, while the Barbican show may be a disappointment for some - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/sep/14/theatre\">but not all</a> - who are steeped in Lepage's past shows, it comes as a revelation to those who have never seen the French-Canadian wizard's previous work. There is something very irritating about being told that the Hamlet you are seeing this year is not as good as the one somebody else saw 10 years ago, or that the show you have booked for is not quite as good as the last thing that the same company did. </p> <p>Last autumn, after the press night of Complicite's A Disappearing Number, I tried to convey to my teenage daughter the glories of <a href=\"http://www.complicite.org/productions/detail.html?id=5\">Mnemonic</a> and More Bigger Snacks Now, productions that would be right up there on my list of desert island shows. She got quite shirty because she hadn't seen them (too young) and now could never see them (such is the ephemeral nature of theatre) unless of course there was a revival. At which point of course, because I've bigged them up, expectation would probably immediately outstrip reality. Similarly in Liverpool last week for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/sep/07/art\">La Machine</a>, I had to keep the niggling thought that this wasn't as good as The Sultan's Elephant in check because it was obvious that most of the people having a fantastic time on Liverpool's streets probably hadn't even heard of The Sultan's Elephant, let alone seen it. It was a complete irrelevance as far as they were concerned.</p> <p>If too much anticipation can crush audiences, what does it do to artists and how do they cope with the weight of expectation? There are few crueller sights than that of the artist who has had a sellout show in Edinburgh one year and has been the toast of the town who returns the subsequent year to indifferent reviews and poor ticket sales. Is the show less good? Perhaps, but perhaps not. Sometimes the artist is simply trying to do something different. But we - critics and audiences - are often guilty of measuring what artists do only by what they have done in the past and judge it by how it measures up. Too much expectation only adds to the pressure and plays into the hands of those who want to manage risk out of the creative process. When we all know that it is only by risking failure that artists make giant leaps forward.</p>",
  "<p>Giorgio Pantano was crowned 2008 champion of GP2, the feeder series to formula one, despite failing to take a victory from the weekend's final two races at Monza.</p> <p>Pantano, who has scored four wins for the Racing Engineering team this year, went into the weekend with an 11-point lead over nearest rival Bruno Senna. He extended this by picking up two points for setting pole position and was leading the first race until a drive-through penalty \u2013 handed out for crossing the white line while exiting the pit lane \u2013 dropped him outside the points at the flag. He sealed the title, however, due to Senna's fourth-placed finish. </p> <p>It was Pantano's fourth attempt at the series, with the 29-year-old Italian saying he would use it to try and find a seat in formula one, in which he competed for Jordan Grand Prix during the 2004 season. \"I am extremely happy because I really wanted to get this title,\" he said. \"It was my last chance to show what I am really capable of and in this way find a way back into F1.\"</p> <p>Putting the championship victory down to more consistency and less mechanical problems than in previous seasons, Pantano added: \"This year they are calling me the daddy, or the grandaddy, but the grandaddy still wins races and wins the championship, you know? Everyone who won this GP2 title went to formula one, and I'm just waiting now.\"</p> <p>Lucas di Grassi won Saturday's feature race from Pastor Maldonado and Sebastien Buemi, while victory in yesterday's sprint encounter went to Davide Valsecchi from Roldan Rodrigez and Romain Grosjean. Di Grassi's win meant he finished the season in third place overall, just one point behind runner-up Senna.</p> <p>Senna, 24, is the nephew of late racing legend Ayrton and has been strongly tipped for a move to formula one next year. \"I think it has been a pretty tough season for us,\" he said. \"I think that we pretty much deserved more than second, but motor racing is full of surprises and variables that you can't control. It was definitely a character-building year for me: I had to deal with so many bad things that happened without giving up, and I never gave up until yesterday when I had to because there was no more chance.\"</p> <p>Ron Dennis, boss of the McLaren formula one team whose driver Lewis Hamilton won the GP2 title in 2006, had claimed on Saturday that there were no outstanding drivers in the series. \"At the moment there are some guys lacking a bit of experience that could do well next year, but I don't think there's anyone in GP2 that jumps at you as being a phenomenal talent,\" he said. \"There are some young ones who will maybe get better next year but no one who is really sensational.\"</p>",
  "<p><br>DJ and producer Oro11 was upset when he discovered he couldn't bring his gold-plated AK-47 on tour. Photograph: PR<br>OK, so if I were to say that the accordion was due a comeback in 2008, you might want to consider closing your browser. But musicians in Argentina are combining cumbia \u2013 traditional music that makes use of that instrument \u2013 with everything from house to hyphy. And it's pretty amazing. </p> <p>Cumbia is a form of Colombian folk music that began life when the drum and clave dance rhythms of African slaves fused with Latin American sounds. Later, so legend has it, accordions became a part of this sound when they were found washed up from a German shipwreck.</p> <p>The sound has spread extensively across the poorer districts of South America where distinct variations of cumbia, such as chicha in Peru, have been born. Cumbia is best known for its accordion melodies, but flutes and guitars are also used to lend impetus to the shuffly, snail-paced 4/4 beat. </p> <p>For anyone unfortunate enough to be familiar with the sound of an accordion, it won't come as a great surprise that the traditional form of cumbia isn't popular with the kids. Cumbia is popular, however, when it's mixed with more contemporary influences. Mexican-American singer Selena had many hits with her synthethised tecnocumbia sound and this popularity led to her being signed to EMI. (Interesting fact: After her murder in 1995, George W Bush, who was then governor of Texas, declared her birthday \"Selena Day\" in the state.) The genre has also spawned some truly awful but popular boy bands, such as the Latin Grammy award-winning Texas-based group <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnxZj7ocX6Q\">Kumbia Kings</a>. </p> <p>The real innovation in cumbia has been happening in Argentina though. It was here in the 90s that cumbia's gangsta rap offshoot, cumbia villera, was started by the keytar-playing Pablo Lescano, whose <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAw4xNr3JF4\">Damas Gratis</a> band has a huge teenage following. Manchester United's goofy-looking striker, Carlos Tevez, is also a keen fan of cumbia villera and even fronts his own band, <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/piolavago101\">Piola Vago</a> (which roughly translates as savvy bum), when not kicking balls about with Wayne Rooney.</p> <p>More recently, and much more interestingly, a new, innovative sound has been emanating from Buenos Aires. Argentina-based producers have been combining cumbia with genres like house, dancehall, hyphy and dubstep. This latest form of cumbia has been labelled nueva cumbia, but it's more popularly known in Argentina as electronic or digital cumbia. </p> <p>The club at the centre of this new movement is <a href=\"http://www.zzkclub.com/\">Zizek</a>, run by DJ Grant Dull. Diplo played there last year and later announced he wanted to \"do something\" with the sound in the future, so expect a flock of sheep gathering the moment that happens. Zizek has seen performances from local artists like El Hijo de la Cumbia, who makes what sounds like laidback, blissful, dubby psychedelic accordion music, and his pal DJ Vampiros, whose sound is part up-tempo Latino Beach Boys cover band, part Buena Vista Social Club. If you want something a little fiercer, check out Vampiros' excellent mixtapes such as La Sonidera Colombiana where he mashes together South American cumbia with cumbia villera and US rap. </p> <p>San Francisco-born and Buenos Aires-residing DJ and producer <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/oro11\">Oro11</a> incorporates elements of genres like hyphy \u2013 the sound born out of his native Bay Area \u2013 and Baltimore into cumbia music with promising results. He then releases these tracks, along with the work of producers such as <a href=\"http://www.thefader.com/articles/2008/2/4/freeload-daleduro-bombon-asesino\">DJ Panik and Daleduro</a>, on the brilliant <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/bersadiscos\">Bersa Discos</a> label, which he runs with fellow Buenos Aires-based DJ Disco Shawn.<br>As bizarre as this may sound, you may have been subjected to some cumbia-influenced music without even knowing. Swiss-Iranian producer Samim's annoying house favourite, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ806mlFoMY\">Heater</a>, sampled Alberto Pacheco's version of the classic La Cumbia Cienaguera.</p> <p>If you're up for hearing some disfigured cumbia in the near future, then you could do worse than to go along and see some of Zizek's resident DJs when they tour Europe over the next couple of months.</p> <p><em>With thanks to <a href=\"http://www.negrophonic.com/\">Jace Clayton</a> for his help with researching this blog. </em></p>",
  "<p>Patients should be offered tax breaks as an incentive to encourage them to take steps to stay healthy, the Liberal Democrats said today.</p> <p>Norman Lamb, the health spokesman, said health boards should be given the power to reward people who sign up for gyms, quit smoking or attend medical check-ups.</p> <p>He said that a \"fundamental shift of power\" was needed from Whitehall to the health authorities, giving them the financial freedom to offer the incentives.</p> <p>\"We'll give communities the power to raise a proportion of revenues locally. Then our health boards can innovate to enable and encourage local people to improve their health,\" Lamb said.</p> <p>\"Incentives could be offered to encourage employers to provide fitness facilities or gym membership to overweight people who can't afford the normal fees.</p> <p>\"Health boards could follow Nova Scotia's lead by offering a tax-back payment for each child enrolled in sports or activity clubs. What better way to help prepare for 2012 and beyond?</p> <p>\"Or they could adapt a scheme from South Africa which incentives adults who attend check-ups, nutrition assessments or preventive screening tests.</p> <p>\"Using locally raised resources, why shouldn't health boards create direct incentives - tax-back payments - particularly focusing on disadvantaged communities?</p> <p>\"For the same price as a packet of cigarettes people could get a weekly helping hand to improve their health.\"</p> <p>In his keynote speech, Lamb added: \"We face the perfect storm in healthcare.</p> <p>\"On the one hand an ageing population, new and expensive treatments, plus the lifestyle challenges of obesity, smoking, alcohol and drug abuse.</p> <p>\"These all add up to a massive increase in cost pressures on the NHS.</p> <p>\"On the other, no government can solve these problems just by throwing more money at them.\"</p> <p>Lamb said health economists had identified \u00a310bn of efficiency savings that could be made in the NHS.</p> <p>He said the Liberal Democrats would scrap health quangos and ditch the government's flagship centralised NHS IT system.</p> <p>The new, more powerful health boards would be free to commission services from private providers, Lamb said.</p> <p>As part of the \"people's NHS\", patients would have a bill of rights, guaranteeing them treatment on the NHS within a set period of time - with free private treatment if the target was not met.</p> <p>Lamb also promised a crackdown on violence in hospitals and said doctors should be able to charge patients who regularly fail to show up for appointments \u00a310.</p> <p>Speaking to reporters, Lamb was unable to say how much his tax incentive scheme would cost, arguing it would be up to local boards to decide what they offered.</p> <p>He acknowledged that \"of course there will be people who play the system\" by taking advantage of the tax breaks without following a healthy lifestyle, for example by not attending the gym or continuing smoking after claiming they had quit.</p>",
  "<p>Thailand's ruling party today agreed to choose the brother-in-law of the ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra for the country's top job.</p> <p>Anti-government protesters immediately dismissed his nomination, heralding further unrest. The People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD), whose activists have occupied the prime minister's Bangkok compound for almost three weeks, had originally demanded the former prime minister Samak Sundaravej step down, accusing him of being a corrupt Thaksin puppet.</p> <p>Somchai Wongsawat, 61, is married to Thaksin's younger sister, Yaowapa Wongsawasdi. He was deputy prime minister and education minister under Samak. If elected by the People Power party (PPP) and its five coalition allies on Wednesday it will inevitably fan the flames of Thailand's political turmoil.</p> <p>\"Somchai is going to be a sitting duck if he takes over the premiership as expected on Wednesday, because the PAD will attack his fatal weakness as being Thaksin's brother-in-law,\" said the political analyst Thitinan Pongsudhirak.</p> <p>At the weekend, Somchai, as caretaker prime minister, lifted the state of emergency that was imposed by Samak after bloody clashes between government supporters and the PAD left one man dead and dozens injured.</p> <p>Samak, 73, was last week forced to quit when a powerful court ruled he violated the constitution by hosting four episodes of his long-running cookery show after taking office, breaching rules on ministers' business links.</p> <p>The PPP exploited a loophole in the constitution - rewritten after the 2006 coup that ousted Thaksin - and immediately renominated him for prime minister. But Samak was forced to withdraw on Friday after a revolt in his own party and its five coalition partners, when MPs expressed their dismay by failing to appear in sufficient numbers for the parliamentary vote.</p> <p>Hours of closed-doors talks by PPP elders and telephone lobbying by Thaksin, who fled Thai corruption charges for refuge in England, eventually allowed Somchai to beat his two rivals, the justice and finance ministers.</p> <p>Somchai, a lawyer who served as an appeal court judge, was a senior bureaucrat in the justice ministry and then the labour ministry while Thaksin was in office. The positions left him open to charges of nepotism, particularly when several justice ministers with whom he clashed were sacked.</p> <p>Protesters among the middle-class ranks of the PAD already have Somchai in their sites. The movement has paralysed Thai politics for weeks with the tacit support of the royalist-military elite, which has refused to remove them from the prime minister's compound.</p> <p>\"We all know who Somchai is,\" said Somsak Kosaisuk, a PAD leader. \"Samak was just a nominee, but Somchai is the real actor linked to Thaksin's family. We will not give him the benefit of the doubt or a honeymoon period.\"</p>",
  "<p>The World Association of Newspapers has written to European and North American competition regulators opposing the online search advertising deal between Google and Yahoo.</p> <p>WAN argued that the deal would have a \"negative impact\" on the ad revenue that Google and Yahoo provide to newspaper sites and called on European regulators to also scrutinise the deal.</p> <p>The Paris-based newspaper body also argued that the tie-up, which will give Google the right to sell search and other text ads on Yahoo's website in a revenue-share deal, will see newspapers pay more for the cost of paid search advertising.</p> <p>The WAN president, Gavin O'Reilly, said: \"WAN believes that the competition that currently exists between Google and Yahoo is absolutely essential to ensuring that our member titles receive competitive returns for online advertising on their sites, and for obtaining competitive prices when they purchase paid search advertising.\"</p> <p>He added: \"In our view the proposed advertising deal between Google and Yahoo would seriously weaken that competition, resulting in less revenues and higher prices for our members.</p> <p>\"WAN is also concerned that this deal would give Google unwarranted market power over important segments of online advertising.\"</p> <p>WAN, which represents 77 national newspaper associations and 18,000 newspapers worldwide, has written to competition regulators in the US and Canada as well as the European commission.</p> <p>WAN said that although the Google/Yahoo alliance was a North American deal, it believed that there would be a \"significant effect\" on European newspaper publishers that warrants investigation by the European Commission.</p> <p>\"Many of our European members are active in North America and will be directly harmed by anti-competitive conduct there,\" said WAN in its letter to the European competition director, Cecilio Madero. </p> <p>\"Secondly, we believe the deal will result in reduced incentives for Yahoo to compete against Google, even in Europe. </p> <p>\"Also because Google and Yahoo together control over 95% of advertisers' search advertising spending in Europe, the two companies could easily set the conditions for competition in the EU if they chose to do so.\"</p> <p>WAN is the second major trade body in a week to publicly oppose the Google/Yahoo alliance.

Those of us that can afford boxes, that is.\" Come here and I'll give you a box, Dan \u2013 right in the chops, you miserable git.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>7:50pm:</strong> Guy Poyet has just been interviewed on Setanta and when asked why Spurs have made five changes to the team from the last game, he helpfully replied: \"It's about decisions.\"</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>7:53pm:</strong> Much speculation on Setanta about where Darren Bent's going to play tonight, with the word from the dressing room apparently being that he's be deployed out left in a 4-2-3-1 formation. Things could be about to get funny. Not on that note, here's Gary Naylor: \"I see at the end of your teamsheets you write - Referee: Steve Bennett (Kent). That's almost the word I'd use to describe him too.\"</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>7:56pm: </strong>The teams totter out on to the pitch, Spurs players looking decidedly sheepish. Villa, since you ask, just look human.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> No outlaws here: the match begins with the mandatory kick-off. \"What's AC Jimbo doing pondering philosophical questions in that photo, sans facial hair?\" belches Gary Wraith, posing a question a darn sight more philosophical than any Jimbo's likely to ponder in the pod.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Pavlyuchneko tries to slip the ball through to Bent - who's on the right, not the left - but Laursen sticks it behind for a corner. Which comes to nought.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Villa \u2013 with seven Englishmen in their starting line-up, BNP fans \u2013 lurch out of their half for the first time but Shorey's cross is wayward.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Spurs 0-1 Aston Villa (Reo-Coker 5') </strong></p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> A goal born of lively Villa attacking and shoddy Tottenham defending- what a surprise! Ashley Young jinked down the left before feeding Agbonlahor, who fired the ball across the face of the goal. Barry, unmarked, couldn't connect but Reo-Coker, also unmarked, could, and he steered it into the net from eight yards. Simplicity itself.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> Spurs muster a response of sorts, Modric twisting through the middle before blemming a low shot straight at Friedel from 20 yards.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Ashley Young buzzes down the right this time, and his crosses from the touchline rebounds out off the post! He certainly didn't intend to shoot, but the havoc is wreaking in the Spurs defence is entirely deliberate. Obviously. \"That's nice, already one down,\" says a sraky Toby Harraway. \"Still, it's good that Newcastle won't be the only 'team in crisis' in the morning - I was getting bored of reading about 'Mike Ashley' anyway.\"</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> Villa are faster and far more fluid. Spurs are struggling to get a touch at the moment. \"Sir, with regard to Point 10 of your preamble, I think Blackburn and Newcastle could also be used,\" intones Andy Bradshaw. Sir, you could be on to something, though I feel you're being overly generous to Stoke.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Spurs are awarded a free-kick for no obvious reasons. Bale swings it in from 40 yards. A head in the posse around the penalty spot sends it looping towards Friedel and Dawson jumps with the keeper, causing him to fumble. Laursen is on hanf to whack it clear.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> Another free-kick from Bale, from the left this time. On this occasion there's nothing for Friedel to worry about, but so far set-pieces have been Spurs most dangerous weapon. Their real only weapon, in fact. Not much sign of Pavlyuchenko so far. \"Is Jonathan Woodgate the most over-rated player in England?\" howls Gary Naylor. \"Has he ever played in a defence that isn't a joke?\" No and yes, Gary. Elaboration: Theo Walcott, and Boro's.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Shorey, perhaps the slowest player in the league after Danny Shittu, is booked for tripping Lennon. And thus Villa's hitherto unblemished disciplinary record is besmirched.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> After spirited Spurs attacking, a Pavlyuchenko shot form 16 yards is blocked by Davies.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>24 min: </strong>Ashley Young receives the ball in splendid isolation down the right and curls in a sweet cross that Barry, surging from deep, heads towards goal. Gomes reacts brilliantly to push it away with one hand.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> After Gomes punches a Young corner clear, Shorey sends it back into the danger zone and Agbonlahor out leaps Bale to turn it towards goal. Gomes makes another fine save.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Ashley Young collects the ball on the left, ambles towards the box and curls the ball just wide from 20 yards. Villa are dominant. Worse for Spurs, Modric is limping following a botched attempt to dispossess Reo-Coker. In fact, he's now being replaced by Jenas.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> Groans around the lane as Lennon invalidates his tricky run down the right by shanking his cross into the stand. \"A friend of mine, who was heavily drunk at the time and winding me up, was pretty sure that Tottenham would finish in the relegation zone this season,\" announces Raymond Stark. \"I laughed at him endlessly and then decided to take advantage of the situation and made a 50 euro bet that Spurs would stay up. Well, I guess karma is biting heavily in my ass now....seems nothing is safe and sure anymore in this world when it comes to money...\" What is sure, Raymond, is that relyong on Spurs is always a waste of money.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Bale delivers a wicked free-kick to the back post but Villa somehow scramble it away. Moments later the ball is lumped back into the box and Luke Young does brilliantly to clear it off Pavlyuchenko's foot as the striker wound up a shot.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> After a net build-up by Spurs, featuring a lovely shimmy by Jenas, Lennon lofts his cross straight to Laursen. Spurs regain possession and recycle it, the ball eventually coming to Huddlestone who tries his luck from 25 yards. Friedel bats it away well. The attack is enough to encourage the home crowd though, and the stadium rocks to cries of \"Come on, You Spurs\". Wasn't that a Dexy Midnight Runners track?</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> The last three minutes ave been a bit like the year 746. Nothing happened. (go on, try to prove me an ignoramus, history fans).</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>41 min: </strong> Bent leads a breakaway with a burst down the right. Which ends when he smashes his cross straight at Shorey.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> Remarkable! A good cross by Tottenham! Not sure who it was and, failing to recognise the exceptional nature of the deed, Setanta decline to show a replay. The subsequent corner amounts to nothing, of course.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Nice lay-off by Bent to Huddlestone. Rubbish shot by the big man, though.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> Spurs finish the half on the attack. Well, in Villa territory at least. And for once they sow discomfort in the visitors' defence, albeit only because Woodgate jumped into Friedel while attempting to meet Bale's corner. Free out. Elsewhere, amateur Andrew Huss offers proof that he's a dab hand at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/746\">technological tampering</a>. Suitably, that's the cue for Spurs fan to boo bitterly. Oh hold on, that's their reaction to the half-time whistle.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>Things to mull over during the break:</strong><br>\"As a historian I won't try to correct your assumption that nothing happened in year 746,\" spake Andy Palmquist. \"Except for Spurs were same then as they are today: forward with a flourish, shoddy defending, and continually managing to crush the souls of Lilywhites around the world.\" </p> <p>\"How will current Bundesliga leader Martin Jol be feeling watching this?\" wonders Kevin Dardis. \"Vindicated? Bitter? Feeling sorry for Ramos? He cares, that much is certain.\"</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> New half, new picture, new player (Bentley on for Zokora) and, best of all, new information: \"One oft-repeated story is that Mel Blanc was allergic to carrots and had to spit them out to minimize any allergic reaction,\" hollers Seydou Camassa, harking back to the Preamble. \"But his autobiography makes no such claim; in fact, in a 1984 interview with Tim Lawson, co-author of The Magic Behind The Voices: A Who's Who of Cartoon Voice Actors (University Press of Mississippi, 2004), Blanc emphatically denied being allergic to carrots.\" Phew, glad we cleared that up.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Excellent block by Dawson on Agbonlahor after Carew had created an opening with a canny lay-off.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> Jenas bangs heads with an opponent, not as a tribute to some heavy metal titan or other, but entirely accidentally. He's currently off the pitch receiving treatment, which is increasing Spurs fans anxiety. Meanwhile, I've been inundated with bozos sending links to the wikipedia entry for 746. Don't you people know any other source? Well, at least one of you does: \"As a professional medieval historian I can confirm that something did indeed happen in 746,\" blurts Sigbjorn Sonnesyn. \"The Gareth Barry transfer saga started in that year, according to the annals of the monastery of Borefest.\"</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Jenas is back and Lennon celebrates by firing a fine shot towards goal. Friedel tips it over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>52 min: </strong>Carew cops a booking for clattering into Bentley. Free-kick to Spurs at the right-hand corner of the Villa box. Bentley sends it to Woodgate at the back post, and Luke Young puts it behind for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>54 min: </strong> After a modicum of pressure from Spurs, Villa break rapidly and the backtracking Bale has to make a brilliant tackle on Agbonlahor to stop the hoe side from falling farther behind.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Spurs 0-2 Villa (Ashley Young 55')</strong></p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> Barry threaded a simple ball through to Young in midfield. He scurried forward unchallenged and let fly from 25 yards ... and Gomes allowed his low shot to squirt under him! Martin O'Neill bounces along the sideline in celebration and Spurs fans bemoan a horrible error by the man bought to replace Safe Hands Paul Robinson!</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Dawson booked for hammering into Ashley Young in a gutless act of retribution. While the victim receives treatment \u2013 along with Carew, who apparently feel awkwardly in an off-the-ball incident \u2013 Ramos ireplaces Dawson with Giovani. Huddlestone drops back into defence. , Ramos \"As an American, I need the expert soccer opinion of a non-American,\" confesses Bryan Tisenger. \"Why is it that the US of A can only produce quality keepers (eg Friedel, Howard) and not any other quality positions?\" My opinion \u2013 which was backed up by Marcus Hahneman when I put it to him not so long ago \u2013 is that it's because Americans youngsters generally play sports that prioritise use of the hands \u2013 you now, such as baseball, gridiron, basketball, TV-remote-control-pressing and so on.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> Carew can't continue, so on comes James Milner is his place.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Dinky football by Spurs around midfield. Naturally it all peters out when they approach the bx, Giovan's shot from 20 yards trickling wide. \"Following Spurs is depressingly similar to following the Democratic presidential bid,\" spews Nick Claxton. \"You start the campaign with the idea that it can't be as bad as last time round and with a modicum of hope, only to see hopes and dreams inevitably crumble.\" Really? Being but a passive inhaler of American political news, I'd got the impression that Obama was set to ride into the White House on a wave of popualr support? Have I been overhearing the wrong bulletins? Actually, don't answer that, I'm upholding my right not to care.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Bale, who's had a decent game, raids down the left and swings a menacing cross towards Bent, who meets it well but can't direct it on target.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Lennon embarks on another mazy dribble, which he tops off with his customary misdirected pass. Here's a question: how good would Lennon be now if he'd spend the last three years under Arsene Wenger rather than at Spurs? \"Surely the withdrawal of Dawson now is bolting the barn door securely after the horse has galloped down the lane and over the hedge,\" neighs Lou Roper, who, unless I'm very much mistaken, was the landlord in lovably cheesy 80s sitcom Three's Company.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Bentley tries a slinky left-footed curler from just outside the box. Bentley's attempted slinky left-footed curler form just outside the box sails high and wide. \"The reason why the USA produces good goalkeepers is simple,\" snorts Sam Stern. \"Goalkeepers don't require and indeed don't benefit from a culture of soccer, ie playing with people in the street, finding pick-up games in every park, etc. They benefit from good formal training and conditioning, two areas where America's status as a wealthy country can be brought to bear.\"</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> After Woodgate blocks a Reo-Coker shot at one end, Lennon hurtles down the other only for Shorey to stop his effort, which, incredibly, seemed to be on target.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>In-game tampering update!</strong> \"According to some joker on Wikipedia, Brad Friedel was born in 746,\" trumpet Andrew Goodie. You people are making me proud, you really are.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Tottenham are having most of the possession now but they're doing vary little with it, and Villa remain primed to spring forward on the counter. \"Many kickers in the NFL are foreign - American kids only know how to use their hands,\" harrumphs Richard Hinsliff.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Lots of blunt probing by Spurs ends when \u2013 guess what \u2013 Villa charge forward on the counter. Fortunately or the home side, Agbonlahor's cross to Ashley Young was fractionally too long. \"As an Arsenal fan, I can tell you that Spurs once upon a time induced fits of rage and emotional rollercoasters, but their fall into mediocrity left me emotionally barren,\" says Pascoe Sabido, while reclining on the couch. \"There's no venom, just perhaps a touch of pity. But this! This is like the birth of that child I never had! the joy! Firmly bottom and losing again - I would have had to pay for years of therapy to uncover those long-lost emotions. Even when we had to rely on a band of dodgy East London caterers, there was no real fear - it was Spurs! But if they fall from grace as spectacularly as QPR did in 746, I may even become a Jehovah's witness - there is a god and I want you all to share him with me.\"</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> After Pavlyuchenko makes a good chance look bad, Agbonlahor sees yellow for faking an injury.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> Woodgate mis-hits a backpass, gifting Vilal a corner. Gomes claims it well. \"Being five places behind Man United would typically represent a pretty respectable league position,\" blurts Kim Limbrick. \"The problem of course being Man U are 13th. I can see the sense in Berbatov angling for his transfer now - he was desperate for a mid table finish.\"</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>JAMMY GOAL! Spurs 1-2 Villa (Bent 87')</strong></p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> A Jenas shank was flying well wide until it hit Bent - who was looking the other way - and changed tack to dribble into the corner. American goalkeeper Friedel looked baffled.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> Lots of shouting and bluster from Tottenham and their fans. But, of course, no threat of an equaliser.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>90+1 min:</strong> Tottenham free-kick deep inside their own halg. Gomes smashes it towards the Villa box. Laursen clears, and a Villa counter is effortlessly set in motion. Gomes parries a Milner shot and Harewood follows up to tap it into the net - but no, Jenas saves some face with a superb sliding tackle.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>90+3 min:</strong> Ashley Young booked for wasting time \"What is this 'culture of football' nonsense?\" screams Fred M. \"Last I checked, the primary sports in Australia are cricket, rugby, and some sort of football code involving extremely tight shorts on oddly tall men. Yet they've managed to produce several halfway decent strikers and midfielders while the USA continues gave us ... Landon Donovan.\"</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>90+ 5 min:</strong> It's all over! Big-spending Spurs remain bottom of the league, beneath Stoke, who beat Villa at home a few weeks ago.</p>",

The British Medical Association said a GP's advice to patients in supermarket surgeries would be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2006/jun/28/medicineandhealth\">undermined by the cigarettes, alcohol and junk food on sale</a>.</p> <p>Although the Department of Health says the government has not specifically proposed supermarkets as locations for GP surgeries, it is keen to improve access to care.</p> <p>Knight said his surgery was needed as in some areas a shortage of NHS dentists meant 50% of the local population were not registered.</p> <p>David Gilder, of Sainsbury's, said: \"We have a long history of providing health care services in our stores, [such as] pharmacies and travel clinics. These services have been enormously popular with customers.\"</p>",
  "<p>One of the recurring themes in the early hours of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree+politics/libdemconference\">Liberal Democrat conference</a> has been that the situation around climate change is getting worse faster than anyone had predicted. Yet when we return to parliament in a few weeks, it will be like stepping into a parallel universe. Instead of recognising that we may already be destined for dangerous climate change, the government will instead ask us to applaud the fact that we have a <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/uk/legislation/\">climate change bill</a> at all. Ministers tell us that the rest of the world is lost in admiration for the UK government and its leadership on climate change. <br> What planet are these people living on? At the moment we have a climate change bill which calls for 60% <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/uk/legislation/provisions.htm\">cuts in CO2</a> by 2050. While that figure may once have reflected the latest scientific knowledge, everyone now accepts that this level of cuts is totally inadequate \u2013 in fact it would be a recipe for disaster. Yet the government resists our call for an 80% target in the bill (although over 80 Labour backbenchers have already backed such an amendment). Meanwhile, the Tories abstain. Yes, that's right \u2013 on one of the biggest issues facing the future of our planet, the Tories are sitting on their hands. Experienced older hands like John Gummer and David Maclean, who have had ministerial responsibility for the environment, are backing 80%, but David Cameron's frontbench can't make their mind up. And don't get me going on the Tory backbenchers who voted against the whole climate change bill because, like Jeremy Clarkson, they think it's all fiction.<br> But if we fail to get the bill toughened up, we send Hilary Benn to the next round of climate change negotiations in Poland later this year with a very weak hand to play. He can hardly demand other countries to sign up to tough cuts when the UK government has wimped out. For me, the issue is not whether we should increase the target from 60% to 80%, but rather whether 80% is enough and whether 2050 is actually pretty irrelevant in any case. The latest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/apr/07/climatechange.carbonemissions\">prognostications</a> by James Hansen (who had a face-to-face meeting with Nick Clegg on this issue recently) suggest we need to get atmospheric CO2 levels down below present levels and we need to do it fast. My nightmare is not that we go too far on climate change, but rather that future generations will look back at our deliberations and despair of our complacency.</p>",

How very even-handed. (That's academics for you.) He'll conclude it's a gamble, he says.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>1.15 PM:</strong> There are now almost as many seats where the Lib Dems are close behind Labour as there are where they are close behind the Tories, he says. So in theory Labour's unpopularity should present an opportunity.</p> <p>Curtice says he's always thought the Lib Dems best chance of getting \"leverage\" in British politics lies in a hung parliament. But the Lib Dems needs to sort out what they would do. He points out that the Lib Dems' failure to strike a coalition deal after the last Welsh assembly election gave Rhodri Morgan the chance to regroup.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>1.15 PM:</strong> As for threats, Curtice says for every two people switching from Labour to the Lib Dems, there are three switching from Labour to the Tories.</p> <p>What's really happening, Curtice suggests, is that the Lib Dems are taking a gamble. He says he's referring to the way Nick Clegg has repositioned the party as one that would cut the overall burden of tax, not increase it. This seems to be in tune with popular opinion. But changing policy on its own is not enough; you have to be able to sell it.</p> <p>Will the public believe the party has really changed, he asks?</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>1.20 PM:</strong> How many people in Bournemouth would be able to tell you that the Lib Dems are now committed to cutting income tax by 4p (or the equivalent) for low earners? Good question. (Hardly any is the answer, I expect.)</p> <p>The other potential problem is that the policy could make it harder for the party to attract support from ex-Labour voters.</p> <p>Hoggart tells us that Teather isn't here because she fell ill after a trip to Nigeria.</p> <p>Huhne comes next. I've just noticed his tie - Technicolor red. Does he pinch them from Jon Snow?</p> <p>Commenting on the polls, Huhne says the Lib Dems have almost always picked up support during a general election campaign as a result of the media coverage they get. The only time this did not happen was when they had two leaders who rowed about tax during the campaign (Steel and Owen in 1987).</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>1.25 PM:</strong> The Lib Dems are also better than other parties at developing an \"incumbency factor\", he says, quoting a Nuffield study. This apparently is worth 6.6% of the vote.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>1.25 PM:</strong> And because the Lib Dems have a relatively young parliamentary party, they have proportionally fewer MPs retiring, which means they do not lose the incumbency factor in seats being contested by new candidates.</p> <p>Moving on to Labour, he says that, even with a new leader, Labour's vote is likely to fall. the Lib Dems have the potential to make very significant gains. (Not everyone in the party agrees - as I've blogged elsewhere today.)</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>1.30 PM:</strong> But Huhne wants to focus on the Tories. He says that, although they appear to be doing well, they are vulnerable, not least because their contention that they are the party of fairness is extremely dubious.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>1.30 PM:</strong> To get a majority of one, Cameron needs a swing of 6.9%. This would be bigger than any previous swing to the Tories, he says.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>1.35 PM:</strong> Huhne moves on to the tax package being debated this afternoon, which shows that the Lib Dems are the party of fairness, he says. For the first time, he's getting people coming to him in his constituency saying that they are struggling with their bills. The \"progressive\" response is to offer them support, he says.</p> <p>So the next election is an opportunity, he concludes.</p> <p>Campbell starts, taking his jacket off. \"I can say without fear of contradiction that this is not a leadership bid,\" he jokes. Funny to think he was running the show 12 months ago. As well as today's debate, he is doing one or two other fringe meetings. But he's not appearing on the conference platform.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>1.35 PM:</strong> He says he was labelled in one of the papers today as a \"centre-left politician\". \"I plead guilty,\" he says, to applause. Like Stephen Williams and Vincent Cable yesterday, he doesn't seem to have accepted the Clegg notion that the Lib Dems are neutral between Labour and the Tories.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>1.35 PM:</strong> The poor pay a higher proportion of their incomes in taxation than the rich, he says. When that is compounded by a Gordon Brown sleight of hand on taxation \"worthy of Paul Daniels\", then the case for reform is even stronger.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>1.40 PM:</strong> Campbell moves on to Europe, saying he won't resile from his belief in the benefits of the EU. More applause. (Huhne didn't get applause until the end of his speech, although I wouldn't read too much into that.) Of course, there are aspects of the EU that need to be reformed. But reform will only happen if Britain engages with the EU.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>1.40 PM:</strong> He says Cameron's inheritance tax plans show that the Tories are not committed to fairness. And Labour's record has shown it to be the most authoritarian government for the last 100 years.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>1.40 PM:</strong> Moving on to foreign policy, he derides Cameron for going to Tbilisi and urging the Georgians to join an EU that his own party dislikes. And he says Cameron described himself as a liberal conservative in a speech in Pakistan because he could not use that phrase at home.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>1.45 PM:</strong> Campbell says one of the reasons he is so keen to describe himself as a politician of the centre-left is that there is no other party on the centre-left now. It's a powerful point, which seems to blow a hole in Clegg's repositioning manoeuvres (although, to be fair, Clegg refuses to use labels like left and right himself, arguing, with some justice, that they are misleading).</p> <p>Campbell also says that he would not support any deal with another party that did not involve early legislation on electoral reform.</p> <p>We're on to questions now. After a quick dig at Europe, another questioner, in response to Huhne, says he is still waiting for the \"late surge\" promised in 1987.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>1.45 PM:</strong> Curtice says he doesn't think Europe will be an issue in the general election, although beating Ukip in the European elections next year could be \"quite a considerable task\".</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>1.50 PM:</strong> Picking up on Campbell's point about PR, Curtice says that in Wales electoral reform would have been part of the deal leading to a Tory-Plaid Cymru-Liberal Democrat coalition. But that pact fell through. He says the chances of the Tories offering PR after the election are almost zero. The Lib Dems need to decide whether they would want to trigger an early second election.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>1.55 PM:</strong> Huhne says the Lib Dems are the only party offering a referendum on EU membership.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>1.55 PM:</strong> Campbell says there were \"quite a lot of sleepless nights\" for him and Charles Kennedy when they came out against the Iraq war. (He is picking up a point about judgment made by one of the questioners.) He says he attended the Democratic convention recently. If the Democrats win, the prospects of the White House pursuing a Bush-style aggressive foreign policy would be extremely unlikely. Even if the Republicans win, American foreign policy would be different because the Americans are losing their appetite for war, he says. From here, Campbell segues into a point about the EU being more important than ever.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>2.00 PM:</strong> Another question. Someone suggests the local income tax policy will be hard to sell.</p> <p>Curtice says that Cable's speech this morning will not have gone down well with well-paid public sector workers (who will have to reapply for their jobs and take a pay cut). He warns that the party is giving out mixed messages.</p> <p>Huhne says the party's tax message is very clear.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>2.00 PM:</strong> Campbell says average household income in Britain is \u00a325,000 a year. The local income tax plan would only expect people to pay more if they are earning more than \u00a375,000 a year. There are millions of people \"in very straitened circumstances\". That's why the Lib Dem tax plans being proposed this afternoon are correct.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>The verdict:</strong> I'm not sure that we learned much more about what will happen to the Lib Dems at the next election. Huhne had some thoughtful arguments as to why the Lib Dems could do better than expected, but his comments about the prospects of winning seats off Labour and about the Tory threat not being as serious as it looks were impressionistic. He didn't support them with electoral data.</p> <p>The highlight of the meeting was Campbell's proud claim to be a centre-left politician in a country where Labour has abandoned the centre-left. He's well off-message. (Huhne is defending a seat where he is vulnerable to Tories keen to depict the Lib Dems as closet socialists.) But I guess his remarks reflect what many Lib Dem activists believe and, judging by his reception today, there seems to be a lot of residual affection for him in the party.</p>",
  "<p>It's a perversion, an aberration, a rogue hobby practised by freaks of nature. It's harder to understand than dogging, weirder than a rubber fetish, far more rarefied than porn and promiscuity. Furthermore, it's endorsed by some of the strangest people, like George W Bush and Sarah Palin. </p> <p>I'm talking about celibacy. Palin approves of sex education in schools as long as it's underscored by a hearty recommendation of abstinence for all her great nation's randy teens. The Bush administration was famous, among its other high points, for promising assistance in the African Aids crisis only if the accompanying educational programme advised abstinence, instead of providing contraception. And the American pop trio the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/09/14/do1407.xml\">Jonas Brothers</a>, whose recent concert in the UK provoked squealing mania among female tweens, wear <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN1130986320080912\">purity rings</a> and spend their interviews talking enthusiastically about how they'll all remain virgins until they marry.</p> <p>I'm not advocating the way of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/15/popandrock.usa\">Jonas</a> \u2013 and may I just say, looking at them, what a waste! I don't believe in abstinence-by-law or in the paternalistic, superstitious, guilt-ridden admonishments of orthodox religion. But I believe in celibacy as a source of power. I make a distinction between a chosen, vocational celibacy and enforced virginity, because the latter is based on fear and the former on joy, free will and confidence. Behind the dogma, the religious cant, the political coercion and the regular human fallibility, celibacy merits serious consideration. What if the promised radiance, detachment, serenity and good judgment ascribed to it are authentic, even if their achievability has been underestimated? What if, for those few mortals born with the talent for celibacy, it is truly source of strength \u2013 a strength they carry into the outside world? What if the purity is real? </p> <p>I'm aware that it's not a hip option. Describing oneself as asexual, as Paul Cox did in his <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/sep/08/relationships.healthandwellbeing\">eloquent Guardian article</a> a few weeks ago, sounds dreadfully unfoxy. That bloodless term divests the protagonist of their spiritual energy, their charisma and their singularity; they are identified only by being not-something. An anvil is asexual. A table is asexual. I think a human being gives off a bit more of a vibe than a table. That lifeforce is not lost to celibates, who use it in their warmest friendships, the passion they bring to their work and their active connection with the world. Indeed celibacy creates a space in which a person can reach their potential, achieving liberty and self-completion without the distractions of what is euphemistically termed their \"love life\". In reality, lust is common in the world, and love is rare. Love occurs most often in friendships, not sexual liaisons \u2013 and it is exactly this pure friendship which celibacy enables.</p> <p>There is an argument for the radical embracing of a celibacy that has nothing to do with sexual anxiety, shyness, body hatred or guilt. When you calm down, take a step back and look at sex in the real world \u2013 the vulgarity of its representations, the rarity of true warmth between sex partners and its ability to make grown adults act like fools \u2013 any rational person would be unimpressed. People mock celibacy because they fear it. They think that without sex they will become a half-person, bored and boring. But what if the opposite happened? The monastic ideal may have failed, but it is still an ideal worth cherishing. In giving up their own romantic hankerings, private obsessions and other kinds of solipsism, they might gain a joyful connection to the world as it really is, without the obscuring haze of personal desire. In reality, lust may be interesting, but it does not lead to happiness \u2013 and it is, ultimately, rather boring and repetitive. </p> <p>I know what I'd pick, given the choice between being an austere medieval virgin warrior and a sexy seductress from a contemporary lipstick ad. In a tacky, pornified world awash with fake plastic breasts, celibacy may be the kinkiest option of all.</p>",
  "<p>The Brian de Palma film of Oliver Stone's screenplay for Scarface (1983) is a landmark film of the 80s. Despite lacklustre reviews on opening, it became an enormous global hit and confirmed Al Pacino as a worldwide star.</p> <p>The poster image for the film, a simplified graphic presentation of Pacino's Tony Montana in black and white and toting a powerful handgun, perfectly expresses the simplified moral universe of the late 20th century American gangster film.</p> <p>We've <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/22/2\">already looked</a> at how Hollywood managed to re-invent itself, after the moribund decade of the 1960s, by connecting with the energy and themes of independent and new wave film making. A significant element in this process was the renewed engagement, by Hollywood, with the historical legacy of American cinema. Nowhere was this more successfully realised than in the re-interpretation of the American gangster genre.</p> <h2>American gangsters</h2> <p>The historical development of the gangster genre can be traced back to the films of James Cagney during the 30s, such as The Public Enemy (1931) and the original Scarface (1932) by Howard Hawks. In the 40s the genre was recast as film noir and reflected the hardboiled crime fiction of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler.</p> <p>For Hammett and Chandler the main protagonists were the private detectives Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe. These figures inflected their stories with a world-weary cynicism, derived from experience, about the motives and intentions of their clients and cases. These stories explore themes that trace the corrupting influence of money amongst people who are already, by most standards, wealthy.</p> <h2>Dirty cops and clean gumshoes</h2> <p>The role of the local police services, and of law-and-order in general, was increasingly called into question and shown to be a system of social control whose corrupted officers played to a gallery of media interests. The purpose of this system was implicitly understood to be as much about maintaining social and economic advantage as about anything else. The fierce independence of the private investigator helped provide him with an oblique and morally uncompromised perspective on events.</p> <p>In contrast, the main characters of the gangster genre were usually drawn from the violent underclass of migrant communities and expressed through first-person narratives of moral disintegration that combine personal wealth and moral ruin. The combination of violence and material wealth, implicit in the gangster's social trajectory, undermined the steady moral ethos of the American dream for ordinary hard working families.</p> <h2>Gangsters reborn</h2> <p>At the end of the 1960s, the gangster genre was re-discovered. The urban setting, car-chase and random violence of the genre made it appropriate for the post-industrial society being conceptualized at the time. These characteristics were re-packaged, with contemporary irony, through a series of Roger Corman films. The films introduced the varied talents of Jack Nicholson and Francis Ford Coppola, amongst other, to the feature film industry.</p> <p>The first mainstream example of the gangster revival was Bonnie and Clyde (1967) by Arthur Penn and featuring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway in the title roles. The success of the film encouraged others to follow. Jack Nicholson reappeared in Polanski's Chinatown (1974) with Faye Dunaway, and Coppola embarked on the epic Godfather series (1972 and onwards).</p> <p>Another personality who emerged from Roger Corman's indie scene was Martin Scorsese. Mean Streets (1973), Goodfellas (1990) and Casino (1995) all provide a continuous thread through Scorsese's career and position the director's work into the social circumstances of his upbringing.</p> <p>The evolution of the gangster is derived from the traditional American quarrel over territory and control. Protection, guns, liquor and gambling follow in historical progression. Finally, the cocaine boom of the 1970s draws Latin and Italian syndicates towards a final showdown. This provides the starting point for Brian de Palma's Scarface.</p> <h2>De Palma</h2> <p>Brian de Palma began film making during the 60s and was instrumental in the discovery of Robert De Niro. De Palma has consistently made films that draw attention to their status as films. The stories, effects and conceits deployed by De Palma accentuate, and draw attention to, the illusionistic effects of film in contrast to the verisimilitude of traditional mainstream film.</p> <p>This is a hangover of de Palma's beginnings as a film maker in the New York avant-garde. Indeed, during the 60s de Palma he declared his intention of becoming the American Jean-Luc Godard. In fact, the political film making pioneered by Godard in Europe never successfully crossed the Atlantic and turned out, in the end, to have been something of an impasse.</p> <p>De Palma subsequently turned his attention to a more fruitful process of deconstructing the conventions of Hollywood genre storytelling. His first success was the horror genre Carrie (1976). Scarface, a reworking of an earlier Hollywood masterpiece, cemented de Palma's place as a member of the new Hollywood generation of directors. De Palma returned to explore themes of violent gangsterism in The Untouchables (1987), which includes a visual reference to Potemkin's famous Odesssa steps sequence (link to previous article), and Carlitto's Way (1993).</p> <h2>Al Pacino</h2> <p>Pacino plays the lead in Scarface with an intensity bourne out of his method acting training at the Lee Strasberg studio. His earlier success, in the Godfather films, lends him an authority in the gangster role of Tony Montana that is terrifying.</p> <p>The combination of drugs, guns, power and money combine to create a moral universe of arbitrary violence and degradation. Pacino plays this decline perfectly with increasing paranoia directed at those closest to him. In the end, Montana retreats into the closed off spaces of his mind and office. The end, when it comes, is brutal and swift.</p> <p>The poster for the film provides a visual icon for this reductive maelstrom. The simplification of the image, to a contrast of black and white, is an economical graphic device derived form screen-printing. The reductive simplicity of the image makes it a perfect icon for a landmark film.</p>",

Or business secretary John Hutton on the growing turmoil within the Labour party?</p> <p>It could in fairness have been any of the above, although it was in fact Hutton, who ostensibly had Gordon Brown's troubled leadership in mind - but <strong>might as well have been talking about Newcastle</strong> - when he went on to declare: \"We need to set out a stronger vision of what we are doing.\"</p> <p>That said, Brown's indecision has merely provoked intrigue about <strong>who will lead the country next</strong>. Mike Ashley's decision to put Newcastle up for sale, on the other hand, has sparked frenzied speculation about the altogether more important issue of who will assume control on Tyneside.</p> <p>It occurs to the Mill that the whole sorry mess could have been avoided had one man just taken his cue from the other. Imagine the nation's delight were Brown to follow Ashley in declaring: \"<strong>I have listened to you.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>10:06am (BST)</strong> </p> <p>This is the moment. A cheer goes up as the formal signing process takes place. It looks more like a Hollywood awards ceremony, with South African president Thabo Mbeki, who brokered the deal, paying tribute to all those who made it happen. The cheering and clapping continues as Mugabe and Tsvangirai put their signatures to the paperwork.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>10:19am</strong></p> <p>Mbeki has introduced Mugabe as president, Tsvangirai as prime<br>minister and Arthur Mutambara, leader of a smaller opposition faction, as deputy prime minister. Leaders of the 14-member regional bloc and of the African Union are at also the ceremony. It's an historic moment - the end of three decades of power for Mugabe. In spite of the carnival atmosphere, Mugabe appears to be the only person in the room who is not smiling. Tsvangirai looks relieved.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>10:25am</strong></p> <p>Mugabe and Tsvangirai just shook hands, although blink and you'd have missed it. It wasn't the warmest of handshakes but it'll still be the picture on tomorrow's front pages.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>10:43am</strong></p> <p>Mutambara has told Mugabe and Tsvangirai that their task now is to make the deal work. \"We fought viciously, now we must deliver on deal,\" he says. <br>Tsvangirai has just got to his feet, to yet more cheers. He makes a round of thanks to Mbeki, the people of Zimbabwe and so on, before getting on to the question of why he signed the deal - \"for the hope of a new beginning\". He has chosen to be guided by hope in order to see a \"rebirth\" for Zimbabwe, he says.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>Tsvangirai is calling on all the parties to \"put the interests of the nation first and work together for a new Zimbabwe\". He also calls on the international community to bring that about more quickly by lending their support. As <a href=\"http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnLF688097.html\">Reuters</a> reports today the European Union has already deferred any decisions about its sanctions on Zimbabwe. Before the deal, the EU had planned to add on more names to a list of Zimbabwean officials whose assets are frozen and who are banned from travelling to Europe.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>11:07am</strong></p> <p>The BBC temporarily lost its satellite link to Zimbabwe - hopefully this is not a bad omen for the peace-keeping deal. It's restored in time for Mugabe's speech.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>11:13am</strong></p> <p>A grim-looking Mugabe sets off on familiar themes. He says its his African neighbours that have helped Zimbabwe, not the British or the Americans. \"Zimbabwe's land belongs to Zimbabweans,\" he warns.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>11:28am</strong></p> <p>The satellite channels have now abandoned their coverage of the power-sharing ceremony, so we'll have to catch up with Mugabe later. But it's given me time to check out Zimbabwe's <a href=\"http://www.sokwanele.com/thisiszimbabwe/\">Sokwanele </a>website, which paints a grim picture of the country's economy. A blog on the site says the powersharing deal has been met with \"cautious relief\" by Zimbabwe's business community.

  "<p>One commonly repeated argument for doing something about climate change sounds compelling, but turns out to be almost fraudulent. It is based on comparing the cost of action with the cost of inaction, and almost every major politician in the world uses it. </p> <p>The president of the European commission, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, for example, used this argument when he presented the European Union's proposal to tackle climate change earlier this year. The EU promised to cut its carbon emissions by 20% by 2020, at a cost that the commission's own estimates put at about 0.5% of GDP, or roughly \u20ac60bn per year. This is obviously a hefty price tag \u2013 at least a 50% increase in the total cost of the EU \u2013 and it will likely be much higher (the commission has previously estimated the cost to be double its current estimate). </p> <p>But Barroso's punchline was that \"the cost is low compared to the high price of inaction\". In fact, he forecasted that the price of doing nothing \"could even approach 20% of GDP\". (Never mind that this cost estimate is probably wildly overestimated \u2013 most models show about 3% damages.) </p> <p>So there you have it. Of course, politicians should be willing to spend 0.5% of GDP to avoid a 20% cost of GDP. This sounds eminently sensible \u2013 until you realise that Barroso is comparing two entirely different issues. </p> <p>The 0.5%-of-GDP expense will reduce emissions ever so slightly (if everyone in the EU actually fulfills their requirements for the rest of the century, global emissions will fall by about 4%). This would reduce the temperature increase expected by the end of the century by just five-hundredths of a degree Celsius. Thus, the EU's immensely ambitious programme will not stop or even significantly impact global warming. </p> <p>In other words, if Barroso fears costs of 20% of GDP in the year 2100, the 0.5% payment every year of this century will do virtually nothing to change that cost. We would still have to pay by the end of the century, only now we would also have made ourselves poorer in the 90 years preceding it. </p> <p>The sleight of hand works because we assume that the action will cancel all the effects of inaction, whereas of course, nothing like that is true. This becomes much clearer if we substitute much smaller action than Barroso envisions. </p> <p>For example, say that the EU decides to put up a diamond-studded wind turbine at the Berlaymont headquarters, which will save one tonne of CO2 each year. The cost will be $1bn, but the EU says that this is incredibly cheap when compared to the cost of inaction on climate change, which will run into the trillions. It should be obvious that the $1bn windmill doesn't negate the trillions of dollars of damage from climate change that we still have to pay by the end of the century. </p> <p>The EU's argument is similar to advising a man with a gangrenous leg that paying $50,000 for an aspirin is a good deal because the cost compares favorably to the cost of inaction, which is losing the leg. Of course, the aspirin doesn't prevent that outcome. The inaction argument is really terribly negligent, because it causes us to recommend aspirin and lose sight of smarter actions that might actually save the leg. </p> <p>Likewise, it is negligent to focus on inefficiently cutting CO2 now because of costs in the distant future that in reality will not be avoided. It stops us from focusing on long-term strategies like investment in energy research and development that would actually solve climate change, and at a much lower cost. </p> <p>If Barroso were alone, perhaps we could let his statement go, but the same argument is used again and again by influential politicians. Germany's Angela Merkel says it \"makes economic sense\" to cut CO2, because the \"the economic consequences of inaction will be dramatic for us all.\" Australia's Kevin Rudd agrees that \"the cost of inaction will be far greater than the cost of action.\" United Nations secretary general Ban Ki-Moon has gone on record with the exact same words. In the United States, both John McCain and Barack Obama use the cost of inaction as a pivotal reason to support carbon cuts. </p> <p>California senator Diane Feinstein argues that we should curb carbon emissions because the Sierra snowpack, which accounts for much of California's drinking water, will be reduced by 40% by 2050 due to global warming. What she fails to tell us is that even a substantial reduction in emissions \u2013 at a high cost \u2013 will have an immeasurable effect on snowmelt by 2050. Instead, we should perhaps invest in water storage facilities. </p> <p>Likewise, when politicians fret that we will lose a significant proportion of polar bears by 2050, they use it as an argument for cutting carbon, but forget to tell us that doing so will have no measurable effect on polar bear populations. Instead, we should perhaps stop shooting the 300 polar bears we hunt each year. </p> <p>The inaction argument makes us spend vast resources on policies that will do virtually nothing to deal with climate change, thereby diverting those resources from policies that could actually make an impact. </p> <p>We would never accept medical practitioners advising ultra-expensive and ineffective aspirins for gangrene because the cost of aspirin outweighs the cost of losing the leg. Why, then, should we tolerate such fallacious arguments when debating the costliest public policy decision in the history of mankind? </p> <p>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org \">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</p>",
  "<p>If this is the death of Wall Street as we know it, the tombstone will read: killed by complexity.</p> <p>Derivatives in their baffling modern forms \u2013 collateralised debt obligations, credit default swaps and so on \u2013 lie at the heart of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/15/lehmanbrothers.creditcrunch\">the failure of Lehman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bearstearns\">Bear Stearns</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/freddiemacandfanniemae\">Fannie and Freddie</a>, and even our own <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/northernrock\">Northern Rock</a>.</p> <p>The philosophy that underpins the growth of derivatives is the idea that risk can be transferred to institutions more able to take the strain. In theory, it's a terrific scheme \u2013 the weak can get rid of risks they can't handle, and the financial system should be stronger as a result.</p> <p>The practice is very different, as Warren Buffett worked out years ago. <a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Business/pdf/2008/09/15/2002pdf.pdf\">His 2002 letter to his Berkshire Hathaway shareholders made headlines by condemning derivatives as \"financial weapons of mass destruction\"</a>. The passage comprised only a couple of pages of the lengthy letter but read it again today - it is the best guide to understanding how Wall Street has arrived at today's mess.</p> <p>Here is Buffett on General Re Securities, a derivatives dealer that Berkshire inherited with its purchase of insurer General Re. \"At year-end (after ten months of winding down its operation) it had 14,384 contracts outstanding, involving 672 counterparties around the world. Each contract has a plus or minus value derived from one or more reference items, including some of mind-boggling complexity. Valuing a portfolio like that, expert auditors could easily and honestly have widely varying opinions.\"</p> <p>Now consider Lehman Brothers balance sheet. On page 62 of last year's accounts, under the heading \"off balance sheet arrangements\" you will find a staggering figure. Lehman had derivative contracts with a face value of $738bn.</p> <p>The notes, fairly, make the point that the fair value is smaller than the notional amount \u2013 Lehman believed the figure was $36.8bn. Even so, \"mind-boggling complexity\" perfectly describes Lehman's business</p> <p>How can you hope to sell such a business over a weekend? You can't, unless the state is willing to underwrite the risk. This time, the US Treasury, said \"no\". Quite right, too: the US taxpayers are on the hook for too much already.</p> <p>Complexity breeds other faults, as Buffett described. Derivatives, because they are so hard to value, make it easier for traders and chief executives to inflate earnings. They exacerbate problems if a company, for unrelated reasons, suffers a credit downgrade that requires it to post collateral with counterparties \u2013 \"a spiral that can lead to a corporate meltdown,\" he wrote. They create a \"daisy chain\" of risk as the troubles of one company infect another.</p> <p>Buffett made a gloomy prediction half a decade ago. \"The derivatives genie is now well out of the bottle, and these instruments will almost certainly multiply in variety and number until some event makes their toxicity clear,\" he said. \"Central banks and governments have so far found no effective way to control, or even monitor, the risks posed by these contracts.\"</p> <p>That event has duly arrived. Lehman Brothers has declared bankruptcy. Merrill Lynch has rushed into the arms of Bank of America. AIG, once the US's largest insurer, is pleading with the Fed for funds.</p> <p>Unwinding a big derivatives book is no easy task - like Hell, derivatives are easy to enter and impossible to exit, said Buffett. That's why the failure of a firm the size of Lehman presents such a risk to the financial system \u2013 we don't know how many other firms will be brought down as the body is extracted from the financial web.</p> <p>In the long run, though, financial regulators must now know what must happen: it's time for them to bring down the curtain on the era of opaque financial derivatives.</p>",
  "<p>Having heard the explanations of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/video/2008/sep/08/video.empowerment\">local government officials</a> as to why the state is so ineffectual in an area like Katine, I next went to Kampala to see what the government might have to say. I got interviews with two junior ministers. The first was Gerard (Geraldine) Namirembe Bitamazire, the minister for education and sports.</p> <p>Government offices in Kampala are intimidating places. Small crowds hang around the entrance way and its often hard to work out who the receptionist is and who are just her friends. When you hand over the ID required you wonder if you'll get it back. Then you're left to wander down corridors, up staircases and hope that you will eventually find your way to the right office (you can roughly work out where an office is by the seniority - the higher up the building, the more important you are, because the higher offices are the ones most likely to catch the Kampala breezes).</p> <p>Bitamazire is half hidden behind piles of papers and initially frosty. She emphasises she doesn't have much time and one gets the impression of a hectic international schedule, from Geneva to New York and back to Kampala discussing education in Africa. I wonder how much time that leaves her to focus on delivery in schools across rural Uganda.</p> <p>But as the interview goes on, it is clear that Bitamazire cares deeply about her brief, and she is only too happy to give me the time to explain.</p> <p>\"Our two priorities are access and equity. So we are building new schools and expanding existing schools to ensure they can cope with a bigger intake,\" she says.</p> <p>\"Debt relief has enabled us to meet the costs of universal primary education. What we want is every child in school. We are operating on the basis of one school per parish \u2013 a parish is five villages [a village in Africa can cover a large area with a scattered population of thousands].</p> <p>\"We haven't yet achieved that goal so there are areas of the country where the number of schools is very low, such as in remote rural regions of the north or in pastoralist sparsely populated areas where people are very mobile. But in densely populated parts of Uganda, we are now 78% there.\"</p> <p> She is confident that Uganda's progress on access to education has made it one of the few countries on track to meet the Millennium Development Goal on education. \"Ninety two per cent of children go to school and by 2015 we hope to have achieved 100%. Our enrolment rate for girls is 51%.\"</p> <p>The Ugandan parliament is debating a law to make education compulsory from six to 13 years, she adds.</p> <p>These are significant achievements, but I put it to her that many people are worried that this emphasis on access has led to a sharp drop in standards as children crowd into huge classes in schools such as those in Katine.</p> <p>\"Quality is not something we can tackle until everyone is in school. Since 1997 we have increased the number of teachers from 84,000 to 129,000 and our next target is 132,000; we recognise that the teacher-pupil ratio is very important. The national average size of a class is now 78, but it used to be 200, our aim is to bring it down to one teacher to 50. The constraint here is the wage bill: teachers make up the largest number of government employees in the country. If the economy improves we will be able to continue to increase the number of teachers. It is the biggest priority in the budget.\"</p> <p>She adds: \"There are other quality issues which we need to improve, such as the pupil to book ratio. We want it to be one book to one pupil, but at the moment it is only one to three children, and in some schools it is one to five or six. We are also worried about the drop out rate and are mobilising the community to deal with this. We have been reviewing the primary curriculum to improve pupil engagement.\"</p> <p>But she completely rejects the argument made by some middle class Ugandans that there is no point expanding access unless the quality is tackled. She insists that there is no point a few children getting a good education instead of a lot of children getting some education. This is the dilemma that faces a country such as Uganda, which, despite all the investment of the last decade, still has a massive uphill task to provide all children with a decent education.</p> <p>\"I was the only girl in my sub-county to get to school and, of course, I got a quality education, but what about all the other girls? No, we want mass literacy rather than an educated elite, and we have had to rebalance our spending to reflect that priority,\" says Bitamazire on an issue that is a great cause for concern.</p> <p>Tertiary education used to be free; the thinking was that if you could pay to get through primary and secondary school, the state would pay for university because Uganda needed graduates. But it was the middle classes who disproportionately benefited, and now fees have been instituted for university. One of the more unfortunate consequences of this \"re-balancing of government expenditure\", as Bitamazire put it, is that bright children from places like Katine cannot get to university. The 4,000 government scholarships are awarded purely on merit and are highly competitive, with the best private Kampala schools often sweeping the board.</p> <p>Bitamazire defends government policy. \"In 10 years time when all these kids have had a free education we will see the impact \u2013 many more people will be able to read.</p> <p>\"I'm a mother of seven children and I know education leads to a better level of health \u2013 washing hands, immunisation. So in the future we won't be spending so much money on health. We also know there is a direct link between education and poverty \u2013 people with skills and education can earn a better living.\"</p> <p>But what about children who turn up at school <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/apr/29/schoolsworldwide.schools\">hungry</a> and can't concentrate on their lessons, I ask?</p> <p>\"How much more can I do? When I sit in Kampala I am helpless, it is up to the parents and the communities to mobilise. These households are not too poor to provide breakfast, because you see the men in the evenings drinking beer,\" she says.</p> <p>\"When I went to school, my parents were not literate, but knew from the missionaries the importance of education. Our family was very poor and we dressed very badly, but my father insisted we could always afford a pencil for my education. I am one of seven and we are all graduates, and my sister is in the US. My parents put education first.\"</p> <p>Her own family story is remarkable and it clearly determines much of her approach to poverty. She seems to me a strong woman, in the mould of Margaret Thatcher, as she tells me: \"I say poverty is in the mind. When people tell me they are poor, I say isn't there something you could buy or sell or make? When someone tells me they can't afford the costs of schooling, such as uniform, I ask them what were you doing during holidays, and if they say, nothing, I warn them that they will get nothing.\"</p>",
  "<p>Has Wall Street <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/business/15lehman.html?hp\">ever seen a weekend</a> like the one it has just been through? Perhaps, in the depths of the <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=abVpg8xJDMWk&amp;refer=home\">great depression</a> - but nothing in recent memory, not even the collapse of the hedge fund LTCM 10 years ago, comes close to the drama and crisis that the US financial system is going through.</p> <p>In case you haven't been paying attention, here's what's happening. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/business/15lehman.html\">Lehman Brothers</a>, one of the largest and oldest US investment banks, is going bust, barring an unlikely last-minute government bailout. Merrill Lynch, for years one of the titans of Wall Street, hocked itself in a <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aNoc_.dGgCYY&amp;refer=home\">firesale</a> to a rival, Bank of America. And AIG, one of the world's largest insurance firms, is <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122142474136033581.html?mod=special_coverage\">begging for a $40bn emergency loan</a> from the US government to stave off its own destruction. In <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122139688846233147.html?mod=fpa_mostpop\">the words of the Wall Street Journal</a>: \"The American financial system was shaken to its core\".</p> <p>And that was just on Sunday. It doesn't pay to take the weekend off on Wall Street these days \u2013 it was just last Sunday that the US Treasury confirmed it was taking control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2013 the vast American mortgage agencies \u2013 at a cost to the taxpayer estimated to eventually range between zero dollars and a few hundred billion.</p> <p>And as the minutes ticked over from Sunday to Monday on the US east coast, Lehman Brothers finally threw in its towel and <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/lehman-goes-bankrupt/story.aspx?guid=%7B50D06AF4%2D0AD5%2D4B38%2D8206%2DD4C8D6E62EC7%7D\">filed for bankruptcy</a>. In one way or another it will be the end for a bank that started in Alabama back in 1844 \u2013 a sticky end considering that last year it had sales of $57bn and only a few months ago was <a href=\"http://images.businessweek.com/ss/08/03/0327_bw50/index_01.htm\">named by Business Week magazine</a> in its 50 top performing companies for 2008. (Business Week's citation, in hindsight, looks wise: \"Still, the firm is highly leveraged. The final throes of the global credit contraction will test just how good it really is.\" Now we know.)</p> <p>What links all these once-buoyant institutions? All of them \u2013 from Fannie Mae to AIG \u2013 have been caught up in the bonfire of the vanities that was the US housing market, the same underlying cause that six months ago saw the combined forces of Wall Street and Washington rush to prop up and then dismember another former investment banking stalwart, Bear Stearns.</p> <p>As the housing market turned toxic, so the loans that Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Fannie Mae et al, had cheerfully advanced, bought up, repackaged and insured, lost value. The Federal Reserve, abetted by the US Treasury, pumped cash into the financial markets to prevent them seizing up. But their efforts were hampered by the very financial instruments that the masters of Wall Street had invented. The blizzard of options and derivatives the banks have used in recent years are byzantine in their complexity, making it very difficult to value the potential losses on the books. </p> <p>That's why the emergence of AIG may be the most troubling event of Wall Street's Bloody Sunday. While the fall of Lehman Brothers was no surprise \u2013 in recent weeks the bank has desperately tried to raise fresh capital and sell its most profitable arms \u2013 AIG is in a different league as (until recently) one of the largest financial institutions in the world of any type. It has (or it did have) a trillion dollars worth of assets. But despite all that, it too is suffering from the shaky mortgages it holds, as well as the mortgage insurance contracts it has underwritten. Now it needs to borrow money on the financial markets on anything other than punitive terms \u2013 and this is the root cause of its problem.</p> <p>To raise funds AIG needs to show potential lenders what its assets are \u2013 and so is forced to put price tags on the swamp of mortgages and derivatives it is holding. As the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/business/15aig.html\">New York Times reports</a>, AIG has been valuing its mortgage junk bonds at far higher than the likes of Lehman Brothers, and so the hole in its accounts is bigger than expected.</p> <p>If that's the case at AIG and Lehman Brothers, then the existential question facing Wall Street this morning \u2013 as it has on so many recent mornings \u2013 is how do you put a value on something that no one wants to buy? You can wait, and hope that something (a housing market recovery?) turns up. You can hope the government gets you out of the jam. But otherwise: when no one wants to buy something, its value diminishes towards nought. And until that problem is solved, next Sunday could be just as exciting as the last two. But we won't even have to wait that long: today is shaping up to be hectic as well, with credit rating agencies poised to downgrade AIG, and stock markets around the world opening to the sound of \"sell\" orders whizzing through the ethernet.</p>"
