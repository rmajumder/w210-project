  "<p>Football fans hoping to catch this season's Premier League matches at their neighbourhood pub should check that their local is still showing the game. The soaring cost of Sky subscriptions has resulted in 20 per cent of bars abandoning the service over the past five years, according to pub trade group ALMR, the Association of Licensed Multiple Retailers.</p> <p>The group claims Sky's premium package price - around \u00a313,000 per annum - combined with the credit crunch effect of higher utility bills and fewer customers is forcing pubs to ditch the service. </p> <p>'Watching a big game in the local with a group of friends is as close to being there as you can get,' said Nick Bish, chief executive of the ALMR. 'It's also the only place fans can watch live Premiership action for free. This pleasure is being threatened by Sky's relentless price rises.'</p> <p>Vince Healy, the managing director of Ascot Inns, a small chain of five pubs, has cancelled his Sky subscription in some bars because of the cost. 'If the price of lager since 1996 had risen at the same rate as pub Sky subscriptions, we would be paying more than \u00a39 for a pint,' he said. </p> <p>The pub trade group claims that the percentage of pubs in the country ditching Sky almost exactly mirrors the percentage price increases imposed by the satellite TV giant. It believes thousands more pubs will have abandoned the service in the past two weeks as August is the only month in which Sky's commercial customers can leave their contracts before being tied in for another year of subscriptions. </p> <p>Even in pubs still showing Sky, punters could be worse off than before as some bars have put up the cost of beer to cover the cost of the subscription, claims the ALMR. 'You have to sell a lot of beer to cover this extra cost so in these difficult economic times businesses are having to pass this on,' said Bish. </p> <p>A Sky spokesman insisted the company's service for pubs had not gone up since September. He said: 'Trading conditions are difficult for landlords, with rising utility bills and drinks prices and the credit crunch and smoking ban reducing customer demand. To assist publicans, we've kept our prices frozen at the September 2007 level.'</p>",
  "<p>Students have got interest-free overdrafts, discount vouchers for money off, cut-price travel, cheap loans, bursaries and grants: do you really need a credit card as well?</p> <p>Most banks and building societies, it seems, think not; only a handful - Barclays, Halifax, NatWest, Lloyds TSB - are bothering to offer a specific card for undergraduates, according to the price comparison website <a href=\"http://www.Moneysupermarket.com\">Moneysupermarket.com</a>.</p> <p>'There really isn't much in the way of student credit cards on offer, and they tend to be generally offered alongside a student account too,' says Samantha Owens, spokeswoman for financial data analyst Moneyfacts. 'They're best used for emergencies when you're really short of cash.'</p> <p>Lenders' reluctance to offer a hatful of plastic deals at 0 per cent is understandable: students, especially 18-year-old undergraduates just relinquishing pocket money, won't have a discernible credit record or regular income outside part-time work.</p> <p>To this end, the credit limits for those students who do qualify are small; Barclaycard's limit is just \u00a3600, a tenth of the sum on offer to regular borrowers, while NatWest and Lloyds TSB both extend credit to just \u00a3500. The interest charged isn't too punitive compared with regular rates, ranging from 14.4 per cent (Barclays) to 19.9 per cent (Lloyds TSB), and some offer a range of discounts on well-known brands to encourage limited spending.</p> <p>Most also demand a higher minimum repayment rate than for mainstream borrowers of 5 per cent, or \u00a35, compared with 2.5 per cent for regular credit card users.</p> <p>Only Barclaycard and Halifax will let you apply for a card without first opening a student account with them.</p> <p>'Even though most 18-year-olds won't have any kind of credit history, we'll look at other things such as whether you're on the electoral roll and your source of income; we think it's important to help build a credit history for the future when you've a job,' says a Barclaycard spokesman.</p> <p>Alternatively, some high-street lenders such as Virgin Money say they will consider students for their regular cards as long as they pass a credit check similar to Barclaycard's. </p> <h2>Three more beers and an insurance policy, please</h2> <p>Freshers' week typically conjures up a haze of beer-soaked recollections: shambling all-night parties; pogoing at gigs; signing up to more wacky university clubs than you can shake a stick at; and poring over insurance policies.</p> <p>If that last memory doesn't ring a bell for you, you wouldn't be alone: one in four students moves into halls or rented accommodation without any cover at all, according to Moneysupermarket.com, the comparison website.</p> <p>Yet students own a higher number of pricey consumer goods per head than the rest of the population, according to the Home Office, which warns that a third of all students are victims of crime each year. Its research also emphasises that those aged between 16 and 24 are three times more likely to be burgled than other age groups, making students a particularly vulnerable group. </p> <p>Esure suggests the average student will take almost \u00a31,500 worth of belongings to university next month as term starts, often including valuable items such as laptops and bicycles.</p> <p>Finding cheap specialist insurance isn't difficult; Cover4students and Endsleigh offer cover at knock-down prices, the latter charging just \u00a364 a year in any UK hall for up to \u00a33,500 worth of items, including \u00a3500 of cover for laptops both inside and outside the room. In Liverpool, off-campus the premium would be \u00a395; in Bristol, \u00a3124; in London \u00a3161. </p> <p>Critically, Endsleigh also covers students for 'walk-in' thefts' - a particular problem, say, when four students live together in a rented house - unlike many of the parents' household insurance policies often relied on by students. Typically, a parent's home cover might offer student cover to a value of 10 per cent but it won't usually cover the summer holidays.</p> <h2>Graduates 'must learn to lead' if they want to succeed</h2> <p>Today's graduates will earn at least \u00a3100,000 more over their lifetime than those with just A-levels, according to research by the Association of Graduate Recruiters (AGR). The highest-paid sectors for graduates to enter include law and investment banking, where the median starting salaries are \u00a336,500 and \u00a335,000 respectively; those choosing the retail sector are paid the least, with median salaries of \u00a317,500. </p> <p>You'll need to think again, however, if you believe just working hard at your degree will land you a future top job in a London law firm; employers warn that students need to work on attributes they might not learn in lectures. This includes developing your communication skills, the AGR says, and running student clubs and other projects to show your leadership potential.</p> <p>'Getting involved in extra-curricular activities shows a certain get-up-and-go attitude which will make you stand out,' says Dan Hawes, co-founder of the Graduate Recruitment Bureau. </p>",
  "<p>With more than half a million students set to start university this autumn, school-leavers across Britain will be preparing for a new life on campus. </p> <p>But if you're heading off to higher education in a few weeks' time, it's crucial to start thinking beyond the all-night parties and pull-a-fresher nights and spend time working out how you're going to manage your money.</p> <p>Financial planning is more important than ever, given that the latest figures from long-term savings provider Skandia suggest that, with the spiralling cost of tuition fees, living expenses and rent, students could end up graduating with around \u00a330,000 of debt in 2011. </p> <p>It also found that nearly half of parents fear that they will have to fund their children's debts for more than 10 years after they graduate. </p> <p>To get off to a flying start, one of the key decisions you need to make is who you are going to entrust with your money. 'For many of us, the prospect of university is the first time we really start to think about our finances and decide who to bank with,' says Sean Gardner, director of price comparison service Moneyexpert.com. 'Likewise, banks realise that if they can get students' custom now, then they may have gained a customer for life.'</p> <p>The banks have already begun cranking up the marketing in a bid to get this year's crop of undergraduates through their doors, and will continue to do so through Freshers' Week and beyond. Students may not have much cash to spare while they are studying, but they are valued as being likely lucrative customers over the long term. </p> <p>'The big banks will pull out all the stops to get your custom as a student,' says Michelle Slade from financial analysts Moneyfacts. 'But this is not all that surprising, given the earning potential the average graduate can have. They are hot property in the banking arena.'</p> <p>And once you're a customer in your post-undergraduate life, banks can look forward to selling you far more lucrative products than bank accounts - such as mortgages and life insurance.</p> <p>One of the main marketing ploys is the offer of freebies if you open an account (see below), and Abbey has just raised the bar here with its \u00a350 cashback incentive. Elsewhere, Lloyds is offering up to \u00a320 cash as part of its package when you sign up, and a further \u00a380 if you recommend up to four more friends, while NatWest is offering a free 16-25 Railcard worth \u00a3125, and Barclays six free cinema tickets. </p> <p>But Kevin Mountford from price comparison service Moneysupermarket.com urges students to look beyond these incentives. 'Don't get seduced by these offerings,' he says. 'Check how relevant these freebies are to your needs, and whether you will actually make use of them.'</p> <p>Also remember that once equipped with an National Union of Students (NUS) card, you will already have access to numerous student discounts and free offers.</p> <p>Instead of the incentives, you should be focusing on the most critical features of any student account: the level of the interest-free overdraft; the rate of interest earned on balances on the black and paid on balances in the red; and any charges levied. Additionally, you should look at what bank support will be there for you, and whether your bank has branches on campus in case of emergency.</p> <p>For most undergraduates, the priority will be an interest-free overdraft. With most student accounts, the overdraft level increases year on year, although Halifax is this year offering a huge \u00a33,000 from day one, and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) \u00a32,750. </p> <p>'The account you choose will depend on how disciplined you are,' says Mountford. 'If you opt for the Halifax or RBS student package, you could have a fantastic first year, but then end up in debt for the rest of your course, so unless you're very good at managing your money, you may be better off opting for one of the providers with a tiered offering.'</p> <p>Barclays, HSBC and Abbey, for example, will all allow you to borrow only up to \u00a31,000 interest-free in your first year, increasing up to \u00a32,000 in your final year. Those with a less than iron grip on their spending habits might find such external controls helpful.</p> <p>You also have to remember that an overdraft is not 'free money'. At some point, it will have to be paid back; leave it too long, and your overdraft will eventually lose its interest-free status. Further, David Black from financial analyst Defaqto points out that the higher limits on some interest-free overdrafts are marketed as being 'up to' those figures.</p> <p>'Not everyone will be eligible for these maximum levels in practice,' he warns. 'Even students are assessed for their creditworthiness.'</p> <p>At the same time, the penalties for dipping further into the red without authorisation can be very steep, so make sure you familiarise yourself with the rates for doing so. </p> <p>RBS, for example, is charging 29.84 per cent and Abbey 28.7 per cent on unauthorised overdrafts, according to Moneysupermarket.com, while Lloyds TSB is charging just 8.2 per cent. As a student, it's crucial that you try to avoid getting into this situation if at all possible. </p> <p>'If you're nearing your overdraft limit, speak to your bank as soon as you can,' says Slade. 'Unauthorised borrowing can be costly, and may impact on your bank's decision to help you in the future. Specialist advisers in your branch - or even at university - can help with hardship advances and give financial advice and guidance.'</p> <p>For those students determined to keep their balances in the black - or for those with generous parental support - there are options that can make your money work harder. </p> <p>'Many of the providers are paying just 0.1 per cent on balances in credit,' says Mountford. 'But HSBC is paying 6 per cent on up to \u00a31,000 for the first year, while Abbey is paying 4 per cent on up to \u00a3500.'</p> <p>Once you have looked at a bank's student package, it's also worth casting an eye over the graduate package it offers; most should give you an interest-free overdraft for at least a year of between \u00a31,000 and \u00a33,000, with limits tapering down over the next year or so. </p> <p>And finally, though you may be keen to get organised ahead of the start of your course, at this stage you may be better off simply familiarising yourself with the various packages on offer. </p> <p>'There's no need to rush in and open you student account right away,' says Andrew Hagger from financial comparison website Moneynet. 'Assess what is available at the moment, then wait until you see the full spectrum of what is on offer.' </p> <p>The current offerings from the banks are not going to disappear, and you might just find that you can bag yourself a larger interest-free overdraft - or a freebie that will actually be useful to you - as you embark on student life.</p> <h2>Abbey convert</h2> <p>Richard Molesworth, aged 20, from Warwick, has made good use of the interest-free overdraft facility on his Abbey student account to help him stay on top of his finances during his three-year degree at Cambridge University. The philosophy student, who has just completed his second year, spent some time researching the various student account packages on offer from the main providers before starting his course, and settled on an account with Abbey. </p> <p>'I like the fact the overdraft limit increases each year, as that helps me to stay within my budget,' says Richard. 'I also make use of the \"sweep service\", which enables me to put money aside into a separate savings account. As long as I'm careful, I tend to manage my finances pretty well, and try to squirrel a bit away into the savings account each month.'</p> <p>With just one year of his degree remaining, Richard plans to go on banking with Abbey once he graduates. </p> <p>'Abbey continues to offer an interest-free overdraft as part of the graduate package, which tapers down over three years,' he says. 'This is a really valuable facility that will help tide me over between graduating and starting my first job.'</p> <h2>What's on offer? </h2> <h2>Halifax</h2> <p><strong>Account </strong>Student Current</p> <p><strong>Credit Interest rate (AER) </strong>2.02%</p> <p><strong>Max Interest-Free overdraft limit </strong>\u00a33,000</p> <p><strong>Unauthorised EAR </strong>24.20%</p> <p><strong>Benefits</strong></p> <p>25% off AA membership; 20% discount on Card Care account insurance; commission-free foreign currency and American Express Traveller's Cheques; all student benefits are available for 12 months after course ends</p> <h2>Lloyds TSB</h2> <p><strong>Account </strong>Student Account</p> <p><strong>Credit Interest rate (AER) </strong>0.1%</p> <p><strong>Max Interest-Free overdraft limit </strong>\u00a32,000*****</p> <p><strong>Unauthorised EAR </strong>8.2%</p> <p><strong>Benefits</strong></p> <p>Up to \u00a3100 cash: \u00a320 when place is confirmed in August and up to \u00a380 when up to four friends are recommended by 15 Sept 2008 and they pay in at least \u00a3200 or their student loan by 31 Oct 2008; instant \u00a3200 interest-free overdraft; free NUS Extra Card; commission-free travel money and non-sterling American Express Traveller's Cheques; free year's YHA membership; 35 free music downloads from eMusic; free text alerts, internet and telephone banking</p> <h2>HSBC</h2> <p><strong>Account </strong>Student Service</p> <p><strong>Credit Interest rate (AER) </strong>6.00% (Up to \u00a31,000 for 1st yr at Uni)</p> <p><strong>Max Interest-Free overdraft limit </strong>\u00a32,000*</p> <p><strong>Unauthorised EAR </strong>8.30%</p> <p><strong>Benefits</strong></p> <p>Free two-year travel insurance; deals and savings with Dell; specialist branches at selected campuses</p> <h2>Abbey</h2> <p><strong>Account </strong>Student Account</p> <p><strong>Credit Interest rate (AER) </strong>4% (up to \u00a3500)</p> <p><strong>Max Interest-Free overdraft limit </strong>\u00a32,000**</p> <p><strong>Unauthorised EAR </strong>28.7%</p> <p><strong>Benefits</strong></p> <p>\u00a350 cashback when account is opened</p> <h2>Barclays</h2> <p><strong>Account </strong>Student Additions</p> <p><strong>Credit Interest rate (AER) </strong>0.1%</p> <p><strong>Max Interest-Free &gt;overdraft limit </strong>\u00a32,000*</p> <p><strong>Unauthorised EAR </strong>27.5%</p> <p><strong>Benefits</strong></p> <p>Six free cinema tickets (one free ticket a month for six months); interest-free overdraft limit of \u00a3200 on account opening; mobile banking</p> <p><strong>Notes</strong></p> <p>*Overdrafts are tiered: Yr 1 up to \u00a31,000, Yr 2 up to \u00a31,250, Yr 3 up to \u00a31,500, Yr 4 up to \u00a31,750, Yr 5 up to \u00a32,000. <br>**Overdrafts are tiered: Yr 1 up to \u00a31,000, Yr 2 up to \u00a31,250, Yr 3 up to \u00a31,500, Yr 4 up to \u00a31,800, Yr 5 up to \u00a32,000.<br> ***Depending on credit score.

  "<p>More students than ever are being forced to find part-time work in bars, restaurants and stores to prop up their years of study financially, it has emerged.</p> <p>An estimated 792,000 full-time UK undergraduates - two-thirds of the total - will have to spend valuable time away from their academic work to earn cash not just to survive student life but to deal with the impact of inflation on rising rents, food, household bills and travel.</p> <p>Research published last week by Halifax also showed that almost half the students surveyed (41 per cent) said they now worked over the summer as well as holding down a term-time job, while 18 per cent held down two jobs or even more. </p> <p>Like the country's nine-to-five working population, students are grappling with the soaring costs of living but doing so without any regular income, says Kevin Mountford, head of banking at price comparison site Moneysupermarket. 'The cost of everything we touch and do is rising - and this applies to students just as it does everyone else.' </p> <p>Not only are students one of the least financially able groups to deal with the soaring costs of living, they are often the least prepared for it. According to a separate report from the National Union of Students (NUS), prospective university students underestimate the basic costs of living, including bills, food and travel, by more than \u00a3450 a year. </p> <p>Wes Streeting, president of the NUS, warned that this disparity was an inevitable sign of the increasing financial pressures imposed on modern-day students: 'While working part-time has become an inherent part of student life for the majority of students, we are concerned that too many are struggling to balance their course with not-so-part-time employment.' </p> <p>For example, 9 per cent of the UK's students work between 16 and 20 hours a week, according to Halifax, though the average currently hovers between eight and nine hours. </p> <p>Although the NUS does not have a formal position on whether paid work can actually complement study, Streeting urged that students should check they were aware of - and receiving - all of the financial support they were entitled to. </p> <p>But at least today's students have the option of varied and fun employment. Sarah Eldoori, marketing director at student job board JustJobs4Students.com, which matches its 200,000 registered students to appropriate employers, says seasonal work can relieve the drudgery of some service jobs.</p> <p>'During term-time, paid work can be anything from shifts in bars and restaurants to call centres and catering,' she says. 'But seasonal work over the Christmas and summer breaks ranges from hospitality at race courses and events like the Chelsea Flower Show, to overseas travel and adventure jobs like skiing and football instructors.'</p> <p>However, to land these roles, you will need to be organised and apply six months in advance to the organisers. </p> <p>Thanks to the internet, students should also find it easier to find a suitable job in the first place, Eldoori adds: 'It's no longer a case of wandering from bar to bar with your CV. Students can register on sites like ours for free and jobs designed to fit around study can then come to them.' </p> <p>But whether you love or hate your student job, you will need to ensure it pays the legal minimum wage. This currently stands at \u00a35.52 an hour for workers aged 22 or over but, if like most students, you are between 18 and 21 you will have to settle for the government's 'development rate' currently pegged at \u00a34.60 an hour. Working a typical eight- to nine-hour week, this puts as little as \u00a340 into a student's pocket. </p> <p>At least when it comes to tax, these earnings will place you a long way underneath Revenue and Customs' radar. This tax year's personal allowance (before which any income tax is charged at all) is set at \u00a35,435, rising to \u00a36,035 in September. If you earn less than this, you will also escape National Insurance contributions, which are otherwise payable at 11 per cent of earnings over this amount. </p> <p>But even if your pay packets leave you sitting safely under this minimum income threshold, don't expect any tax avoidance to be automatic. It will be down to you to tell the taxman that you are a non-taxpayer, and the easiest way to do this is to fill in a P38(S) form - preferably before you even start to earn. This is a special form for working students who can safely declare in advance they will not be earning over the income threshold. You can pick up a P38(S) from your employer, local tax office or Post Office. </p> <p>If you don't get this done in time, or your employer is slow to act, you will have no choice but to join its PAYE scheme. This means you will be charged an 'emergency' tax rate of 20 per cent while waiting to be put on to the correct tax code. But, as this can almost wipe out all your hard-earned cash, you will want to resolve this issue as quickly as possible. Do this by filling out a P46 and handing it to your employer. The funds will be paid back to you in your next pay packet with any luck which - alongside your new tax-free earnings - will at least result in a welcome bonus. </p> <p>Watch out, though: if you are hitting the recruitment agencies during your summer break or over Christmas, remember that this could push your earnings over the \u00a36,035 threshold, which is actually only \u00a3116 a week. In this case you will pay 20 per cent of the difference in income tax to the Treasury, just like the rest of working Britain. </p> <p>And if you do find yourself stuck behind a counter, bar or call-centre desk while your friends are out having fun, console yourself with the fact that a moderate amount of paid work at university can be good for you.</p> <p>'As well as the social benefits some jobs can offer, earning a regular wage prepares students for the bumpy ride life will bring - and give them practice in making it smoother by being organised with their finances,' says Mountford.</p> <h2>Rent by the pint</h2> <p>Jack Harding, from St Albans in Hertfordshire, is about to take his final year of a social anthropology course at the University of Manchester. It will also be his third year working at the halls of residence university bar, a job that he applied for before even starting the course. </p> <p>'I needed to work and thought I'd have a better chance of getting a good job if I arrived before all the others ,' says the 20-year-old.'It paid off, as the job is fantastic. The bar is very sociable and meant I had a network of friends before the course even started. The other real bonus is that I'm employed by the university which is sympathetic to the demands of my course. It also means I will not lose my job when I come home for summer as the bar shuts too.' </p> <p>In a typical week, Jack works nine hours across two evening shifts. 'I'm paid \u00a37 an hour, which is a good wage and exactly what I need to pay for my rent. The rest of my expenses are covered by student borrowing.' </p> <p>Even if he was not dependent on the income from his job, Jack says he would still choose to work: 'While it is important not to work so many hours that the job interferes with your study, it's good from a responsibility point of view. After all, you have to start working for your own money at some point, so you may as well take a run-up to it to minimise the shock.'</p>",
  "<p>Where were the leaders when the lights went out? Every crisis in the global or national economy is a test of leadership - and a condemnation of preceding failure. Today's disasters were set in train by people, then foolishly regarded as heroic leaders, whose insane and inane errors led their followers into the abyss. </p> <p>Yet this debacle occurred after a long, soaring boom in which business leaders and leadership were celebrated (and remunerated) as never before. Any issue of the Harvard Business Review, for example, was liable to contain an inspiring piece on leadership. Indeed, an entire HBR 'article collection' is devoted to 'Leadership Fundamentals' and how to 'chart your course to Great Leadership'.</p> <p>'Great Managership' somehow doesn't have the same ring. By its nature, leadership is where the action is. Managers and management have been side-tracked in an era that celebrates inventions like leadership's 'online labs' and 'the uncompromising leader'. For $10,000 you can hear Jack Welch, erstwhile CEO of General Electric, at a two-day Boston jamboree. On the menu is, naturally, 'The key characteristics of effective leaders and how to put them into action'. Welch came to power and glory through one of leadership's most striking demonstrations: the turnaround he staged in the then most highly valued corporation in the world. He started a 20-year reign by assuring everyone that his predecessor's well-regarded reign was actually a slow-moving journey to disaster. This analysis became a manifesto for wholesale change, which in turn won him the nickname 'Neutron Jack' for eliminating large numbers of staff while leaving the buildings intact, in the manner of the bomb of the same name.</p> <p>De-staffing, even on this scale, was no Welch innovation. In fact, as the easy part of crisis management, cutting jobs is a standard programme, like getting better control of the cash. That element of establishing better order and discipline - ie, sound management - is basic to the rearguard actions that the majority of Britain's business leaders are fighting today. When orders shrink, costs soar and prices fall, you can't afford sloppiness.</p> <p>Could you ever? It shouldn't take possibly the worst business disaster since the Great Crash of 1929 to emphasise the vital importance of good housekeeping. That's what managers are supposed to supply and good leaders demand. </p> <p>But leadership is meant to provide much more than a healthy cash flow and ever-rising investment returns. It is the spark that ignites new ventures, spurs innovation, tries out novel ideas, invents and/or penetrates new markets. </p> <p>A true leader isn't just somebody who doesn't make mistakes, or someone whose successes outweigh their flops. The right people generate and regenerate organisations by the quality of their thought, the speed and effectiveness of their change management and their desire for victory in competitive markets. In or out of crisis, the anxiety (all too often justified) is that sitting managements, conditioned by rigid environments, miss out on the magic. In crisis, however, that loss is intensified by the urgent need to save the endangered ship. </p> <p>In fact, all types of investment - in people, projects and processes - are needed in good times and bad. Indeed, bad times are in some ways the ideal environment for the innovative, path-finding leadership that creates new opportunities. Ask Steve Jobs of Apple or Jeff Bezos of Amazon, who told Business Week: 'My view is that there's no bad time to innovate.'</p> <p>At Apple, when the IT bubble burst, Jobs made a conscious decision to raise investment, moving into the gaps created by the cutbacks obligingly carried out by his rivals. Bezos states baldly that Amazon had no option but to carry on innovating. 'For us, it's such a deep-seated model, I'm not sure we have a choice.' In other words, you won't achieve anything by abandoning the building blocks of achievement.</p> <p>It's not only a question of waiting for the good times to roll. That's leaving it too late. At Intel, previous CEO Andy Grove observed that most companies don't renovate their leading products until the returns have already shrivelled and new competition is baying at the door. In his opinion, even heavyweights never recover from passing what he called the 'strategic inflexion' point.</p> <p>Time is a crucial factor, and the critical time for a firm is not determined by the wider business cycle. Anyway, good leaders in a recession innovate revolutionary processes as well as products to mitigate the impact of a hostile climate. Within those grey clouds lie riches galore - and that is as true today as ever it was. </p> <p>For example, how about an industry whose current sales exceed $20bn and are predicted to continue growing at 8 to 10 per cent? Five leading makers of executive jets are rubbing their hands - alas, none of them British. Yet wasn't there a world-beating British civil jet industry once? Perhaps a leader or two missed their strategic inflexion point.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Simon Caulkin is away</p>",
  "<p>If the characters in Tobias Wolff's stories share an experience, it is this: they live a lie and then for a moment things become much clearer to them. The experience is one that writing has always afforded Wolff, too. His memoirs, This Boy's Life and In Pharaoh's Army, are, among their many other pleasures, definitive documents of fleeting self-knowledge. The former deconstructed the untruths of childhood, the latter the lies the author told himself about war. Wolff grew up - partly, ironically, in a town called Concrete - among more than his share of dissembling, most of it emanating from his runaway father (a figure characterised by his brother and fellow novelist Geoffrey as 'the Duke of Deception'). In view of this background, I once asked Wolff, in an interview, what he trusted most. He looked at me squarely - sharp eyes, bald head, round glasses, bushy moustache - 'Oh, the writing,' he said in his baritone, without hesitation. 'That's where I place all my faith.' </p> <p>To read the best of Wolff's stories - and all of those selected here fall into that category, including the 10 new tales that conclude this volume - is to repeatedly share in that faith, to feel the varied force of the possibilities of candour. All great short fiction trades in unexpected revelation; Wolff is such a master of this craft that even in rereading the surprises remain fresh. There are plenty of old favourites here: 'Next Door', in which a stiff couple lie in separate beds and are terrorised by the life of their neighbours, the sound of their fights and the ardour of their making up (not to mention the man's nocturnal habit of peeing over the garden fence), is still about as comic and poignant an examination of the hell that is other people as could be crafted in five pages, while 'The Rich Brother', in which a materially successful first son goes to pick up his younger sibling from yet another failed commune, unlocks everything you need to know about brotherly dependence and rivalry and love.</p> <p>'Sentences are factual,' Gertrude Stein once observed, 'but paragraphs are emotional.' Wolff has long taken that knowledge to heart. His paragraphs, their rhythm, are things of great care. This is the opening to 'Deep Kiss', a new and remarkable story of first love: 'When Joe Reed was a boy of 15, his craziness over a girl became such a burden to his family, and such a curiosity to the small town where they lived, that his mother threatened to pack him off to his married sister in San Diego. But before this could happen Joe's father died and his mother collected a large sum from Northwestern Mutual, sold the family pharmacy, and moved both Joe and herself to California.'</p> <p>No word in that paragraph is not putting in a full shift, but it is the trajectory of it, the change in register from love to death to practicality, that gives it its pull. How could you not want to find out what becomes of Joe Reed, whose whole life has already been mapped out in the gap between those two sentences?</p> <p>In the best sense, there is a powerful suggestion of utility in Wolff's fiction. He believes, you guess, his stories to be of use in getting at the truth of things. You'd be hard pressed, in any case, to find a more cogent understanding of the responsibility and toughness of being a parent than 'Nightingale', in which a father is taking his son to the military academy he believes will make a man of him, a place his son has no wish to go to. In the course of their drive, and on arriving at the school, the father begins to understand the delusions he has always lived under and feels for the first time the hardest of parenting lessons - the idea that his child understands more about his life than he does. He watches his son walk across the parade ground, trying to keep step with the cadets. 'The distracted saunter he kept breaking into wasn't an accident of age, something to be outgrown or overcome; it was, in truth, nothing less than Owen himself.'</p> <p>That 'in truth' crops up from time to time in these stories. That you always believe it gives Wolff's writing its great charge. As he well understands from his own growing up, though, there is no clear line from knowledge to wisdom; decisions have a life of their own. In 'Nightingale', Owen's father realises he has just stolen his son's childhood, but that doesn't stop him driving home.</p>",
  "<p>In a business famous for tantrums and tiaras, Amancio Ortega is the fashion industry's reluctant hero. His name does not trip off the tongue like that of British Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green, but the shy Spaniard who prefers jeans to suits is the brains behind Zara, the fast-fashion phenomenon that is the pretender to Gap's crown as the world's largest clothing retailer. </p> <p>In the first quarter of the year Zara's parent company, Inditex, outsold its US rival for the first time, posting sales of \u20ac2.2bn (\u00a31.7bn) for the three months to April. If the momentum continues, it could usurp Gap, which had sales of $15.8bn (\u00a38.5bn) last year.</p> <p>The march of Zara has propelled Ortega, a high-school dropout, into the ranks of the super-rich. The son of a railway worker started making dressing gowns and lingerie in his living room before opening his first shop in 1975. Now he is worth an estimated $20.2bn.</p> <p>Ortega is seriously low profile, living with his second wife in a discreet apartment block in the centre of his home town of La Coru\u00f1a, a seaport in Galicia, north-west Spain. Until Inditex (short for Industria de Dise\u00f1o Textil - 'Textile Design Industry'), listed on the stock exchange in 2001, only a handful of photographs were in circulation. </p> <p>A fit 72-year-old - he works out for two hours a day - Ortega can still be found at Zara's futuristic HQ, nicknamed 'the Cube' by employees. He ranked eighth on the Forbes 2008 rich list.</p> <p>He spent the first decade conquering the domestic market, crossing the border into Portugal in 1988. Next stop, world domination: Zara now has nearly 4,000 stores in 70 countries that pumped out sales of \u20ac9.4bn in 2007. Under his watchful eye, Inditex chief executive Pablo Isla continues to lead one of the fastest roll-outs in retail history. Last year the retailer opened another 560 stores around the world, and 640 are planned this year. Indeed, the scale of its ambition has worried investors, who question its growth plans as consumer spending slows in several of its key markets - sentiment that has hit its share price.</p> <p>The retailer has become a textbook example of an ultra-modern business for its ability to marry design, marketing and retailing flair with world-class IT and logistics. Unlike rival giants such as Gap, it measures lead times in weeks rather than months. An existing style can be back in the stores inside a fortnight, but even an entirely new Zara garment takes only five weeks or so from design to delivery. For example, when Spain's Crown Prince Felipe announced his engagement to Letizia Ortiz Rocasolano in 2003, the bride-to-be wore a stylish white trouser suit. Within a few weeks, hundreds of European women were wearing a close approximation. </p> <p>Zara's store managers note what customers buy, then feed the data back to HQ. In a typical year, Zara launches 11,000 styles versus Gap's 2,000 to 4000, with Inditex making two-thirds of its goods in Spain as opposed to the Far East, arguing that the flexibility counteracts higher labour costs.</p> <p>During the Nineties, Inditex began to branch out through acquisition or by developing new brands in-house so as to target different shopper segments. Although Zara is by far its biggest chain, with 1,400 stores, it has seven other fascias, four of them with a UK presence: Bershka, Pull and Bear, Massimo Dutti and Zara Home. There are no imminent plans to import the others - Stradivarius, lingerie chain Oysho, or accessories brand Uterque.</p> <p>Zara arrived in Britain in 1998, and has since opened 80 stores. Its Iberian charm has turned out to be a slow burner and the rate of expansion in UK is regarded as evidence that the retailer is finding Britain a harder nut to crack than other European markets.</p> <p>Ortega, who has also invested in gas, tourism and banks as well as property, remains Inditex's largest shareholder. Of his three children, his daughter Marta, who is in her twenties, is expected to take over when he retires. It is said that Ortega likes to lead a quiet life; luckily his clothes speak volumes.</p> <h2>H&amp;M: hot Swedish cheap-chic</h2> <p><strong>Another dynastic firm, its Stella McCartney range turned sane women into 'shopzillas' and it has now made a breakthrough into the tough American market </strong></p> <p>There are no Henneses or Mauritzes behind H&amp;M: just the Perssons, a no-nonsense Swedish clan who have conquered the cheap-chic market. When it is on the fashion pulse the consequences can be dramatic: the Stella McCartney range turned sane women into 'shopzillas', wrestling to get their hands on her cut-price designs. When it opened its first store in Hong Kong in 2007 customers camped outside for 48 hours.</p> <p>H&amp;M's name is a reflection of the dynasty's pragmatic founder Erling Persson, who chose the name 'Hennes' - Swedish for 'hers' - because the first store sold only women's clothes. Persson, a salesman, got the idea on a business trip to the US just after the Second World War. The H&amp;M credo was born when he visited a retailer that appeared to balance high sales volumes with low prices. Persson opened the first Hennes store in his native city of Vasteras in 1947. </p> <p>H&amp;M grew steadily during the Fifties and Sixties, adding 'Mauritz' in 1968 after buying hunting and gun store Mauritz Widforss. But it was under the leadership of Erling's son Stefan, who took charge of the international business in the late Seventies, that the seeds of global success were sown. Today Stefan's personal fortune is estimated at $17.1bn while his sister Liselott - Lottie to her friends - has $2bn.</p> <p>Stefan oversaw a period of rapid expansion before stepping up to be chief executive in 1982. H&amp;M is now a global powerhouse with 1,500 stores in 28 countries. Last year it made a \u00a31.6bn profit on sales of \u00a37.8bn. Unlike Zara and Mango, the UK is important to H&amp;M and has become its second-largest market in sales terms after Germany. In a further sign of its fashion mettle, H&amp;M has managed to make a go of the US, a market that has defeated many European rivals. It opened its first store in New York in 2000 and now has 150 shops. </p> <p>After a turbulent year that has seen sales vary dramatically from month to month, H&amp;M cheered analysts last week by reporting a better than expected 3 per cent increase in underlying sales for July.</p> <p>H&amp;M has opted to collaborate with big-name designers and celebrities on clothing collections. In addition to McCartney, it has worked with Karl Lagerfeld and Roberto Cavalli as well as Kylie and Madonna. The strategy is very different to that of Inditex, which spends very little on marketing. Although not as nippy at 'fast-fashion' as Inditex, H&amp;M, which does not own any factories, says it meets demand for new styles with daily deliveries of stock to its stores.</p> <p>Despite the retailer's association with celebrity, it does not seek fashion PR at any price. It dropped supermodel Kate Moss from ads in 2005 after photos of her allegedly taking drugs were published in the British press. The move was said to reflect the family's staunch anti-drug stance - Stefan is on the board of a substance abuse charity. A keen sportsman, the 60-year-old is a fan of downhill skiing, golf and tennis. His only vice is thought to be Savile Row suits.</p> <p>Stefan stepped up to the chairmanship in 1998 but there is evidence that fashion is in the genes. Of the new generation now involved in the business, his son Karl-Johan is tipped for great things. He is the business's development director, a role that sees him heading its fledgling chain Cos, the first new brand in its 60-year history. Cos targets more affluent shoppers - handbags at dawn as the Swedes head for a high-street showdown with Inditex's upmarket Massimo Dutti chain.</p> <h2>Mango: the power of youth and celebrity bears fruit</h2> <p><strong>From a stall in a Barcelona street market, Isak Andic has stretched his fashion chain round the world and is now planning to spend \u20ac760m in doubling its turnover</strong></p> <p>Mango has sashayed up the UK high street with the help of Spanish siren Pen\u00e9lope Cruz. The 'Madonna of Madrid' is part of a gaggle of celebrities ranging from Liz Hurley to Lauren Hutton the Spanish chain hires to grab fashion column inches. The glamorous faces in its advertising campaigns are far better known than its mercurial, Turkish-born founder, Isak Andic, who emigrated to Spain when he was 13 and started selling T-shirts to fellow students at Barcelona's American High School.</p> <p>The young entrepreneur - worth an estimated \u00a31.6bn today - soon progressed to running a wholesale business, selling clothes in Barcelona's Balmes street market, but realised there was more money in retail and opened the first Mango store in the city in 1984. Like Inditex, the company behind Zara, the retailer has expanded rapidly to 1,000 stores in 90 countries, but, unlike its arch-rival, tends to work with franchise partners. </p> <p>That means Mango's main role is clothing design, and to that end it employs an army of twentysomething women at its sprawling Barcelona headquarters. The average Mango employee is 28 and its wealthy owner, now 53, is so keen to keep Mango young and dynamic that no one says usted - the formal Spanish 'you' - even when addressing him.</p> <p>Little is known about Andic, whose brother Nahman is also involved in the business. The married father of three sits on the board of Banco Sabadell, one of Spain's largest banking groups, and is said to be a keen sailor. He divides his time between homes in his adoptive Spain and Russia.</p> <p>Mango's global store network is fed by hi-tech logistics centres sending out 30,000 items an hour. The retailer generates annual sales of \u20ac1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn), three-quarters of which come from outside Spain, with international sales overtaking the domestic market in 1997. It does not disclose profitability.</p> <p>This year Andic revealed plans to invest \u20ac760m in expansion over the next four years. In that time he expects to double both the size of the chain and its turnover. In an interview in Spanish daily newspaper Cinco D\u00edas, he also quashed speculation that a management reorganisation in 2007 - when Mango formed its first board - was a precursor to a flotation, stating the retailer could finance growth from its own cash flow.</p> <p>British women have not always taken Mango to their hearts and it has had some hiccups during the decade it has been in the UK. But with sales of less than \u00a350m, the market accounts for a small percentage of its turnover. At present the retailer is in expansionary mode, with new stores and concessions planned.</p> <p>It is also seeking to widen its customer appeal, hiring 'It girl' model Alice Dellal to appeal to fashionable youngsters in the UK while also running a campaign featuring 64-year-old former supermodel Lauren Hutton to encourage women of all ages to wear the brand.</p> <h2>UK: big profits for retail's royalty</h2> <p><strong>The retail kings who have shown most staying power on Britain's high streets are all billionaires who prefer to keep their fashion business in the family</strong></p> <p>There is no shortage of retail royalty in the UK with Sir Philip Green, River Island founder Bernard Lewis and Primark scion George Weston all fashion billionaires.</p> <p>Green leads the fashion rat pack, sharing an estimated \u00a34.3bn fortune with his wife Tina. Monaco-based Green is one of the highest profile businessmen in Britain having made a financial killing in 2002 from the \u00a3850m purchase of Arcadia, which owns seven brands including Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins Green, who also owns BHS, made history by paying his family a \u00a31.2bn dividend three years later. It is too early to say if he has founded a dynasty as his children Chloe and Brandon are still teenagers although few would bet against it.</p> <p>Compared to the colourful Green, Lewis is the 'quiet man' of retail. With 60 years in the rag trade under his belt he is unapologetically old school with staff said to address him as 'Mr Bernard'. However, good manners have not stopped Lewis building a \u00a31.6bn fortune. At 82, he is still involved in the day-to-day running of an empire that through the family vehicle, the Lewis Trust, spans property, banking and hotels in addition to River Island. Retail was in his veins as he grew up over his parents' fruit shop on the Holloway Road, where he claims to have served customers while still in short trousers. In 1948 he started a clothing shop with his brothers, David, Godfrey and Geoffrey - today River Island has sales of close to \u00a3900m. The Lewis Trust is dominated by Lewises, with several generations now working alongside each other in the business. As for succession, Mr Bernard shows no sign of giving up his day job yet.</p> <p>George Weston was also destined for a career in retail. He is the third generation of a dynasty that has established retail empires in both the UK and North America. He is the son of Garry, the British publicity-shy architect of Associated British Foods, which owns Primark. His family is worth a cool \u00a31bn.</p> <h2>Benetton: master of the shock tactic</h2> <p><strong>Notorious for its advertising in the Nineties, fast fashion made the maverick brand seem outdated. Now a new generation of the clan is about to take over</strong></p> <p>Gory shots of newborns, copulating horses, a priest and a nun kissing... the Benetton brand is widely remembered for its controversial Oliviero Toscani advertising campaigns of the Nineties.</p> <p>The artistic freedom Luciano Benetton gave his photographer friend is typical of the maverick businessman at the head of one of the world's most enduring retail dynasties. With his wavy white hair and spectacles, the charismatic Italian made the retailer famous for art and sport as well as acid-bright jumpers.</p> <p>According to Benetton lore, Luciano left school at 14 after the sudden death of his father, taking a job in a clothing store to support his family. In 1965 he set up a small knitwear company with his sister Giuliana and two younger brothers Carlo and Gilberto in their home town of Treviso, near Venice. Luciano is credited with developing 'industrial fashion' - fashionable clothes sold through a cost-effective system of production and distribution. Initially, many of its stores were franchises. </p> <p>Today the siblings are worth an estimated $6bn (\u00a34.7bn), with 5,500 stores in 120 countries. The company is listed in Milan, Frankfurt and New York, but the family's holding company, Edizione, owns two-thirds of the shares. Over the years they have diversified their considerable wealth, investing in toll-road operator Atlantia and catering group Autogrill. They sold their Formula 1 team to Renault in 2000 but remain patrons of sport, including Treviso's volleyball team. They also own a nearby golf course.</p> <p>Benetton's star burned brightest on the high street in the Nineties, when its sweatshirts and lambswool jumpers acquired cult status among teenagers. But the march of fast fashion, led by Topshop, Zara and H&amp;M, made its conservative styles appear dated and expensive - the same fate suffered by Gap. The group fell into the red in 2002 but has since rebounded to post robust growth; in 2007, it made a profit of \u20ac145m on sales of \u20ac2bn and has made a strong start this year with sales ahead 5 per cent in the first half. But it has struggled to regain its best form in the UK and over the past five years has overhauled the chain, closing stores and introducing fast fashion.</p> <p>Despite its globetrotting, the group remains rooted in north-eastern Italy, an economy that combines a strong artisan tradition with an abundant labour supply due to the decline of agriculture. Older employees say the Benettons use the local dialect rather than formal Italian.</p> <p>With the founding generation now all in their seventies, the baton is being passed to their children, four of whom have been appointed to the Edizione board. However, Luciano's son Alessandro, a Harvard Business School graduate and a former M&amp;A analyst at Goldman Sachs, has emerged as the heir apparent, taking the role of deputy chairman. </p> <p>Luciano says he is coming round to the idea of retiring 'after 40 years in which I have not had time to draw breath'. He plans to sail off into the sunset on Tribu, a 50-metre yacht he had designed to meet exacting environmental and luxury standards; a grand piano and a prosciutto slicer are among the essentials aboard.</p>",
  "<p>Under fire from Republicans, top Democratic politicians in the United States are considering lifting a ban on new offshore oil drilling.</p> <p>The issue is now at the forefront of the presidential election, as Republican candidate John McCain has made allowing new drilling one of the centrepieces of his campaign, claiming that it will help drive down petrol prices.</p> <p>Democrats have hitherto said new drilling would do little to relieve consumer pain at the pump, accusing Republicans of misleading the public and being a pawn of big oil companies. Yet signs are emerging that they are easing their opposition to the comprehensive ban. </p> <p>Last week House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would consider allowing a congressional vote on the issue if drilling was part of a wider energy plan that also focused on promoting alternative energy sources. Pelosi told a television interviewer that she would consider a vote, but 'it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public, and not just a hoax'.</p> <p>More than 30 Democrats have signed up to sponsors legislation that could pave the way for fresh drilling off America's coasts. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has also moderated his stance, moving from staunch opposition to suggesting that new drilling could be part of a new energy strategy. That shift led to accusations from some of his supporters that he had flip-flopped.</p> <p>A group of politicians from both parties, dubbed the 'Gang of 10', has proposed a mixed strategy of new drilling and alternative energy, which could gather wide support.</p> <p>Yet plans for any fresh off-shore drilling have outraged environmentalists. They believe it will take years to develop any oil reserves and that the move represents nothing more than a bonanza for an oil industry that already gets huge tax breaks. They also believe it will eventually pave the way for drilling in ecologically sensitive areas, such as parts of Alaska.</p> <p>But the issue has become a problem for the Democrats after McCain enthusiastically embraced the idea. In the unusual setting of a massive biker rally in the small town of Sturis, South Dakota, the Republican recently told a cheering crowd: 'We're going to drill here and we're going to drill now!' It is a line that has since been repeated on the campaign trail and has struck a chord with those parts of the American public for whom high petrol prices are the key concern. It certainly threw Democrats off-balance, as they tried to push a more balanced energy policy with longer-term aims of reducing oil use. </p> <p>But energy policy has rapidly become the hot topic of the election, overtaking even Iraq or Georgia. In a country whose cultural and economic life is dominated by the car, there are no more passionate debates than over the doubling of petrol prices in the past couple of years. </p> <p>It has offered hard-nosed Republican campaigners an issue to rally around and a stick with which to beat an Obama campaign that has started to make rare missteps. In one recent incident Obama mentioned that, if Americans kept their tyres inflated correctly, it would save petrol consumption and reduce the need for drilling. The comment was factually true, but was seized on by Republicans, who carried out numerous stunts, such as delivering tyre gauges to reporters on the campaign trail. It became a powerful theme on conservative talk radio, where hosts lampooned Obama and accused him of putting tyre pressure at the forefront of his energy policy.</p> <p>In fact, the energy debate has enlivened a Republican party that has recently seemed moribund beside the huge and well-run Obama operation. It has allowed the party to attack the Democrats and set the agenda of the recent political debate, giving Republican activists a sense of hope.</p> <p>'This is a narrow race. Obama has a solid edge, but it is still close,' said Professor Shawn Bowler, a political scientist at the University of California at Riverside. The polls are bearing that out. As the party convention season looms, the RCP national average of polls has Obama ahead by just three points. In the battleground states the picture is mixed, with McCain ahead in Missouri, Virginia and Florida, and Obama leading in Ohio, Michigan and Colorado.</p>",
  "<p>Can it be done? Martin O'Neill certainly thinks so and today in Birmingham we are about to start discovering if his Aston Villa team can break into the Premier League's Big Four cartel when they take on Manchester City, a team with similar aspirations. </p> <p>'It's difficult, but if I didn't think I could do it I don't think there's any real point in hanging around,' he says. 'If we can keep our better players, get into the top four then the acquiring of better players in the forthcoming season should be easier.' </p> <p>This was a specific reference to the Gareth-Barry-to-Liverpool farrago and a general point about the only real way - other than an injection of serious money from owner Randy Lerner who does not appear to be in the Roman Abramovich league - O'Neill can improve on last season's sixth and gain a Champions League place. It is unclear whether O'Neill will still have Barry at the close of the transfer window, although that prospect must have improved following his appearance in the 4-1 Uefa Cup victory against FH Hafnarfjordur on Thursday, which disqualifies him from playing in the Champions League until the new year. </p> <p>And asked if, actually, it might not be the end of the world were Barry to leave - he seems to have moved from being underrated to overrated during the past 12 months - O'Neill does not disagree. 'We've put what we call a proper valuation on the player, [although] Mr Parry said that wasn't the case,' he says of the Liverpool chief executive and Villa's asking price. </p> <p>Generally, though, how realistic is it for any club other than Chelsea, Manchester United, Liverpool or Arsenal to keep their best performers? 'Well, the big boys are in control,' O'Neill says. 'They have squad, capabilities and, certainly at Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United, the tradition. Chelsea are different - they're a team one man has decided to put a lot of money into. </p> <p>'In my day Kenny Dalglish was the best in Britain so why shouldn't he be paid more? When I was at Nottingham Forest, Peter Shilton was obviously on better wages than us, and he told us about it! Sure, the game has changed immensely, but it should not be impossible to keep your best. I don't actually begrudge quality players getting good money - but mediocre ones?' </p> <p>Whatever the varying abilities of his squad, O'Neill's first-choice team should, at the start of the campaign at least, be virtually an all-English one.</p> <p>'Last season we scored a lot and let in a lot,' O'Neill says of a year in which only Manchester United and Arsenal managed more goals. 'People might say that's entertaining. I think we're capable of scoring a lot this year, and we should try and do better about letting them in.' </p> <p>It all starts at Villa Park this afternoon.</p>",
  "<p>Things just got even tougher in Texas. The Lone Star state, which prides itself on its macho Western cowboy image, is now to have the first school district in America in which teachers can carry concealed guns.</p> <p>The tiny community of Harrold, in the far north of the state, has recently approved a local decision that allows its teachers to bring firearms to school to protect against possible shootings.</p> <p>So when the school re-opens after the long summer holiday, any of the college's 50 or so staff could bring pistols to their classrooms. The decision is likely to provoke uproar in other parts of America and will shock gun control advocates, who argue that teachers with guns in class actually escalate the chance of a shooting.</p> <p>However, those arguments have cut little ice with the authorities in the Harrold school district. They are worried that a steady stream of shootings in schools and colleges in America will eventually reach their small, isolated region. Although that seems unlikely, school shootings are a real problem in America. Last month, three people were wounded at a shooting in Phoenix, Arizona.</p> <p>Local officials have argued that the single campus in their 110-student district is too far away from the nearest sheriff's office if there were an emergency. They have also said that a nearby main road might increase the chances of a dangerous gunman attacking the school.</p> <p>In a local newspaper interview, David Thweatt, the superintendent of the Harrold Independent School District, defended the decision and said keeping guns out of schools was more dangerous than having them in. </p> <p>'When the federal government started making schools gun-free zones, that's when all of these shootings started. Why would you put it out there that a group of people can't defend themselves? That's like saying \"sic em\" to a dog,' Thweatt told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.</p>",
  "<p><strong>No 28</strong></p> <p><strong>Humphrey Bogart 1899-1957</strong></p> <p>The wild son of a well-off New York doctor, Bogart was drawn to the stage after abandoning thoughts of medicine and commerce. He served a long apprenticeship - 16 plays, 11 little remembered films - until appearing on Broadway opposite Leslie Howard in the allegorical Depression drama, The Petrified Forest (1935), as a gangster. At Howard's insistence, Bogart reprised his stage role in the screen version and was put under contract at Warner. There were a further 28 films - some good, some bad, most indifferent.</p> <p>In one of them, the delightful Hollywood-on-Hollywood comedy Stand-In (1937), he co-starred with Howard. He played gangsters and villains before emerging from the shadows of Cagney and Robinson as Roy 'Mad Dog' Earle, a vulnerable, ageing mobster in High Sierra (1941). His stardom was confirmed the same year as private eye Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon, the first of his six collaborations with friend and drinking companion John Huston, who directed him in his Oscar-winning role as the boozy riverboat skipper finding love and redemption in The African Queen.</p> <p>Only occasionally thereafter did he play criminals, though his heroes invariably had a dark, complex side. Sentimentality was alien to his nature. His most famous character, Rick Blaine in Casablanca, was an anti-fascist activist who brushed aside accusations of patriotism and idealism. In at least three of his finest parts, he crossed the line between sanity and madness: the prospector in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, the alcoholic screenwriter in In a Lonely Place, the best of his own productions, and the psychotic Commander Queeg in The Caine Mutiny.</p> <p>Bogart was not always as tough off screen as on and, in 1948, though without abandoning his liberal views, he apologised to the House Un-American Activities Committee for his uncritical opposition to their investigations, claiming that political naivety had made him support the short-lived Committee for the First Amendment. </p> <p>He was not conventionally handsome, though strongly individual, glowering, sardonic and saturnine. His facial expressions were subtly economical, his lisp was turned to comic advantage when he pretended to be a gay bibliophile in The Big Sleep. He was taller than Cagney and Robinson, 5ft 8in, the same height as the alluring Lauren Bacall, who made her screen debut opposite him in To Have and Have Not (1944) aged 19, became his fourth wife and matched him drink for drink, wisecrack for wisecrack, until his painful death from cancer in 1957. </p> <p><strong>Bogart on Bogart </strong>'Democrat in politics, Episcopalian by upbringing, dissenter by disposition.'</p> <p><strong>Raymond Chandler on Bogart </strong>'Bogart can be tough without a gun.

  "<p>When the refrigerator mechanic and young conscript soldier Anatoly Babi was given the chance in the autumn of 1968 by his military superiors to 'see the world', he leapt at the opportunity. The son of peasant parents born in the Soviet republic of Kirghizia, set off in an army lorry to Hungary, where he joined a large force of his fellow Soviet soldiers.</p> <p>What Babi did not realise then was that he was part of a 100,000-strong force of troops from the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact that, exactly 40 years ago this week, were to roll into Czechoslovakia and crush the 'Prague Spring', the liberalisation movement led by the country's Communist party First Secretary, Alexander Dubcek. His attempt to introduce democratic reforms into the rigid socialist state and give socialism a 'human face' had captured the world's imagination. It led to six months of reform - from abolition of censorship to the recognition of human rights - an extraordinary period in Cold War history, which the Czech documentary film-maker and historian Jan Kaplan described to The Observer as 'a brief loosening of the straitjacket of party rule, a deep breath of fresh air before being submerged again'.</p> <p>Babi, then 26, soon realised that his adventure was far more dangerous than his commanders had let on. The Russian-Ukrainian soldier was with the artillery that was to go into action if full-scale war broke out. 'We were given gas masks. We were told to sleep in our clothes. We were told to expect big exercises. But when we were given real bullets and set off in a convoy on rails, I understood that it was no game,' the now retired father of five told The Observer in an interview at his house in the country outside Moscow.</p> <p>'The commanders said there had been a coup, an uprising, and it was our job to make sure there was no repeat of Hungary 1956,' he said, referring to the revolt against Hungary's Stalinist government. 'We were told we were fulfilling our international duty,' he said.</p> <p>He recalled the reception they received from Czechoslovak citizens. 'They threw bricks and cobblestones at us and even tried to set fire to our vehicles,' he said. 'I understood then that they didn't see us as liberators.' The hatred culminated in injury for Babi when an angry old Czech man threw a grenade at him while he was trying to disarm a band of resistance fighters.</p> <p>In the week when tanks have again been dispatched by Moscow to another country, Babi has allowed The Observer to publish his snapshots of that time, including a ghostly image of his comrades in a pine forest and one of himself standing next to his lorry. 'Because we lived under communism, we assumed the Czechs were happy with that system too,' he said. 'If I had known then what I know now, I would not have been so desperate to go ... but would have stayed at home and fixed fridges.' </p> <p>The brothers Jan and Bohumil Hajny were among millions of Czech citizens who watched as the tanks rolled into the country and past the front door of their family house in the Prague district of Hostivar. Factory worker Jan, also 26 at the time, recalled his shock at realising that the six heady months of the Prague Spring - when Czechoslovakia flirted with the dream that the communist system could be turned into 'socialism with a human face' - were over.</p> <p>'We received a phone call at 6am that the Russians had arrived at the airport and were taking it over,' Bohumil Hajny said. The first reaction of the amateur photographers was to go out and capture the events with their cameras, a Chinon semi-automatic and a Praktika, despite the protests of their concerned mother. The extraordinary shots for which they braved attack by the armed troops, and witnessed civilians being killed, were later put in the family photo album to which they have now given The Observer exclusive access after 40 years. 'We just realised that these were extraordinary events, and we wanted to set them down,' said Jan. </p> <p>Taken on 21 August and the fraught days thereafter, they track the invasion's development and depict some of the most dramatic scenes; of the headquarters of Radio Prague being heavily attacked by Soviet forces; of Wenceslas Square and the National Museum, which the Russians mistook for the Communist headquarters, pummelling its fa\u00e7ade with bullets (the scars of which can still be seen); and of the funeral of Jan Palach, the Czech student who set himself alight in January 1969 in protest at the Soviet occupation. It is bizarre to see on some of the images how after several days Czechs began to return to their normal business. Women in miniskirts clutch their shopping bags and walk past tanks, apparently oblivious to the troops, as if resigned to the fact that they are in for a long period of frosty oppression. 'We simply didn't understand why they had come,' said Bohumil. 'We were so convinced we had been moving socialism in the right direction with the Prague Spring.'</p> <p>Neither, recalls Jan, did the troops seem to know why they were there. Many had been told they had been sent to save a country from Western imperialism, but little more, not even where they were. 'I spoke to some of the soldiers in Russian,' said Jan. 'They didn't even know they were in Prague, but they said they had come to fight a counter-revolution. When their commander saw us talking, he pointed a gun at me and told me to scarper.'</p> <p>During those days the lives of Jan, Bohumil and millions of others, whether they chose to stay or to leave Czechoslovakia, were irreversibly changed. 'We had tasted freedom and the winds of change,' said Bohumil, 'and suddenly it was taken away from us. We were young, so we lost many years of living in freedom.' The frost did not thaw for another 21 years. His most painful memory was hearing the 10 o'clock news bulletin on the radio on 21 August. 'I remember the lady presenter informing us these were her last words, followed by the national anthem. After that the whole family wept together.'</p> <p>The brothers' friend, Jan Kaplan the film-maker, who never returned to live in Prague after the invasion but made his life in London, has compared the disappointment of the destruction of the Prague Spring to a romantic failure. 'It was like a date for which you were so full of hope. You were all loved up and definitely going to get laid, but then it didn't happen. For Czechoslovakia it was an unsuccessful date with history.'</p>",
  "<p>'Reality TV' has long been a potent source of horror. From the 'lost documentary' footage of Ruggero Deodato's gruelling Cannibal Holocaust to the celebrated hoaxings of Snuff and The Blair Witch Project (and its lesser-known sibling The Last Broadcast), fright fans have revelled in the suggestion that what we are watching may actually be 'real'. While Hollywood made a belated big-budget splash in this area with the faux 'found videotape' gimmick of Cloverfield, Spanish film-makers Jaume Balaguer\u00f3 and Paco Plaza pushed the lower-budget envelope with this terrifically muscular journey into the abyss.</p> <p>Manuela Velasco stars as wannabe TV reporter Angela, anchorwoman of a dreary, dead-air filler entitled When You're Asleep ('Well, who watches it then?'). Hoping for televisual action on a night with the local firefighters, Angela and her crew find themselves quarantined within a locked-down tower block when a 'trapped' resident takes a bite out of her would-be rescuers. All hell breaks loose and is duly captured on shaky, blood-splattered video.</p> <p>While the premise might be nothing new (George Romero's Diary of the Dead trod a similar thematic path), there's plenty to be afraid of as the body count rises and the morbid scares come thick and fast. Shooting on real locations in Barcelona, Balaguer\u00f3 and Plaza reportedly kept their cast in the dark about some key shocks, generating reactions of genuine fear that their cameras eagerly record. Rising sound-whizz Oriol Tarrag\u00f3 (who played such a key role in The Orphanage) provides aural upsets which unsettle and unnerve with orchestrated precision. Even our usually sober censors were moved to observe that 'the film's sense of immediacy and realism creates a strong sense of genuine threat which results in a terrifying, disturbing and intense viewing experience'. A ringing endorsement!</p>",
  "<p>Scotland Yard's senior legal adviser on racial discrimination cases is head of ethics for an organisation officially censured as being 'open to the charge of institutional racism', The Observer can reveal. </p> <p>Edward Solomons, director of legal services for the Metropolitan Police who is overseeing several race discrimination claims against the Met, is chair of the ethics committee at the Solicitors Regulation Authority which last week was described by one lawyer as one of the 'most racist ever' organisations in the UK. Equality lawyers last night demanded that Solomons step down from advising on contentious racial discrimination cases involving the Met.</p> <p>The demands come before a potentially explosive move on Wednesday by Britain's highest-ranking Asian police officer, Tarique Ghaffur, who will formally lodge a legal action against Scotland Yard alleging racial discrimination. </p> <p>Ghaffur's legal team will file a claim containing fresh allegations about the relationship between Commissioner Sir Ian Blair and businessmen over the awarding of Scotland Yard contracts. Talks between Met lawyers and Ghaffur have collapsed and his friends describe his claims of discrimination as 'eye-watering.' Shahrokh Mireskandari, of Dean and Dean Solicitors, who is representing Ghaffur, claims that Solomons is not fit to preside over such a high-profile case. He said: 'The report into the Solicitors Regulation Authority is probably the most damaging report ever into racism at any organisation. There is a question of Solomons and his dealings with ethics at the SRA and his role in the Met in handling such cases.' </p> <p>However, a Scotland Yard statement said that issues involving the SRA and the Met were utterly separate. It said: 'This report has no impact on any claims being dealt with by the Metropolitan Police's directorate of legal services.'</p> <p>Last Thursday's independent report into the SRA, written by Lord Ouseley, former head of the Commission for Racial Equality, heavily criticised the leadership of the SRA, the body that regulates solicitors. </p> <p>It said such were the potential discriminatory effects of the way it conducted business that the SRA could, in effect, be dubbed racist and 'open to the charge of institutional racism'. </p> <p>Ouseley's findings have inflamed tensions between the Met's senior command and those who allege that Scotland Yard has failed to improve since the Macpherson inquiry into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence 10 years ago concluded Scotland Yard was 'institutionally racist'.</p> <p>Ouseley also found that SRA staff paid 'lip service' to equality and 'stereotyped' black and Asian lawyers by assuming guilt before investigating. His investigation was prompted by concerns that black and Asian solicitors were more likely to be targeted for investigation by the SRA, which is the regulatory arm of the Law Society. </p> <p>Mireskandari, who has launched an unprecedented \u00a310m claim against the Law Society and the SRA for racial discrimination, harassment and victimisation, claiming that he has been hounded by the organisation, said: 'It appears untenable that Scotland Yard can take advice from the man in charge of ethics after such findings'. </p> <p>The SRA said it had started introducing key recommendations included in Ouseley's report and would publish a new equality strategy for the body next month. A statement said the Ouseley report had found no evidence of any 'inappropriate findings' made against solicitors by the SRA.</p>",
  "<p>The value of sterling may be plummeting as fears grow over the depth of a possible recession. But in the scenic East Sussex town of Lewes - famous for its bonfire night parties and bewildering number of pubs - a handy alternative is about to become available.</p> <p>Next month, in the latest sign that localism is a coming force in British everyday life, Lewes will launch its own currency. In doing so, it joins a growing list of communities around the world attempting to protect regional economies and preserve the distinctive 'feel' of towns and villages.</p> <p>The Lewes pound will initially be accepted in around 30 locally owned shops and a first run of 10,000-plus notes is expected. It is the largest-scale launch of a local currency in the UK since Lewes had its own pound in the 19th century and, in a coup for the organisers, the town's branch of Barclays bank has agreed to accept it.</p> <p>Those pushing the Lewes pound, which by law cannot display the Queen's head but is legal tender, stress their humble ambitions for the new currency. 'There will always be a need for a national currency, but it's a question of trying to go back to what can be done locally,' said Oliver Dudok van Heel, one of the scheme's architects. 'This is not us versus the rest of the world,' added Beth Ambrose, a sustainability expert, who denied that the Lewes pound was a declaration of independence. 'All we want to do is strengthen what's good in our community.'</p> <p>According to one analysis, 80 per cent of the money that goes into a supermarket till leaves the local economy immediately. By backing local stores such trends can be reversed, say the scheme's supporters. 'We had a beautiful, independent toy shop here once,' van Heel said. 'It's now an estate agent.'</p> <p>Lewes is not alone in its aspirations. In Totnes, Devon, a complementary currency has been running for more than a year. Similar schemes have been launched abroad and it is estimated there are about 9,000 around the world. Across the Atlantic in Berkshire, Massachusetts, some $800,000 worth of local 'Berkshares' are boosting a thriving alternative economy. Switzerland has introduced a localised credit card scheme, while Holland and Germany have had a surge of interest in complementary currencies.</p> <p>Those backing the new schemes say they are 'big tent' projects which try to involve the whole community. Experts agree that they thrive in places where people have become disillusioned with central government, suggesting they reflect more than merely economic concerns.</p> <p>'This is political, but with a small p,' said Patrick Cockburn, a Lewes resident who is backing the new currency. 'It seems a Tory sort of idea - empowering individualism - but it's really about boosting the local community.'</p> <p>In Argentina, demand for local currencies took off after the economy collapsed in the late Nineties. 'These types of currency go right back,' said David Boyle, a fellow at the New Economics Foundation in London. 'There was a flurry of complementary currencies in the Great Depression. But President Roosevelt outlawed them because he was afraid they might undermine the banks.'</p> <p>For this reason, proponents of the Lewes pound believe now is the right time for its launch. 'With the current credit crunch, there is some disquiet about the global economic system,' van Heel acknowledged. 'Who knows how important this could be? Studies show if there is more than 12 per cent unemployment in a community these systems become very popular.'</p> <p>If anywhere can make a new currency work, the locals of Lewes claim it is their town, which prides itself on its independent spirit and the absence of the likes of Starbucks. It already has form when it comes to minor uprisings. After Greene King, the brewing and pub chain, stopped selling the locally brewed Harveys beer and ale at the Lewes Arms there was a mass boycott and the drinks were back within months.</p> <p>Perhaps, then, it is no coincidence that the town's most famous resident is the radical political pamphleteer Thomas Paine, credited with sowing the intellectual seeds of American independence. Etched under a painting of Paine on a wall of one of Lewes's churches is one of his most famous aphorisms: 'We have the power to build the world anew.'</p> <p>Two centuries on, the inhabitants of Lewes have the chance to show in their own small way that they still agree.</p>",
  "<p>When I moved from Germany to London four years ago I needed some furniture for my new flat. I thought that some shelves, a small table and a few chairs would do nicely, so off I went to my nearest Ikea. It looked and felt exactly like the one in Essen, my home town. There too you have to fight your way through the whole store, past all those bathrooms, kitchens and living rooms to reach the useful odds and ends just before the check-out. The menu at the restaurant was also identical: the same salmon steaks and K\u00f6ttbullar meatballs with lingonberry sauce. There was only one thing that was strangely unfamiliar: the prices. They were much higher.</p> <p>I quickly bought a packet of my favourite Swedish biscuits, got a copy of the Ikea catalogue and called my friend Jenny. Jenny is not only a great fan of Ikea, she even learns Swedish (I sometimes wonder whether she wants to talk to the Bj\u00f6rkudden, Fj\u00f6rby and Gran\u00e5s furniture). Most importantly, though, she still lives in Germany. </p> <p>I asked her to take the German Ikea catalogue off her Billy shelf and go through it with me over the phone. It was fascinating. The German and British catalogues had the same products, illustrated with the same pictures on the same pages, but with markedly different prices. The German items were about 20 to 30 per cent cheaper than the same ones in Britain. I realised that it I would have saved a lot of money if I had bought my new furniture back home and then brought it with me to the UK. This was my introduction to the phenomenon commonly known as 'Rip-off Britain'.</p> <p>Over the following years my impression of Britain as an expensive place was confirmed, especially when I compared it with Germany and Australia, the two countries where I had previously lived. Unfortunately, the Ikea price hikes were not the worst difference. Train tickets were bad, too: London to Manchester and Cologne to Hanover are about the same distance, yet a standard second class single will set you back \u00a3115 in Britain but only \u00a349 in Germany. A trip from Berlin-Alexanderplatz to Sch\u00f6nefeld airport costs the equivalent of \u00a31.67. A similar journey from central London to Heathrow, however, is \u00a34 on the tube and \u00a314.50 on the Heathrow Express.</p> <p>Movie tickets are just as bad: on Friday evening you can watch Will Smith's Hancock for \u00a313.45 in London's Leicester Square or for just \u00a38.40 in Sydney's George Street. Australians also put cheaper fuel in their cars: it may seem unbelievable to British motorists, but Sydneysiders are currently complaining about record-breaking fuel prices \u2013 at just under 80p a litre.</p> <p>Britain is one of the most expensive countries on the planet and London its rip-off capital. Filling your car, eating out, staying at a hotel or just doing the weekly shopping are all more costly undertakings than in other industrialised countries around the globe \u2013 even without taking house prices into account. </p> <p>International companies know this and pay their staff premium wages when they send them here. Mercer, a human resources consultancy, estimated that London's cost of living (including housing) was more than a third higher than in cities like Sydney, Amsterdam, Munich or Los Angeles, a difference that would be bearable if there was a corresponding gap in the quality of life. Yet, having thought about it for a long time while my tube train was stuck in a tunnel on Thursday morning, I do not believe this is the case. If anything, life in London is worse than it is in other big, international cities. In a recent worldwide survey, it came 38th on the quality of life score.</p> <p>No company could expect to survive if it offered its customers third world products and services but charged them first world prices, so why should Britain? If the UK continues to be one of the most expensive addresses in the world while it fails to provide the best infrastructure and public services, it should not be surprised if it loses its most qualified people and fails to attract foreign professionals. </p> <p>There is also another problem: while young professionals can vote with their feet and go to places where life is better and cheaper, many people, like those with families, cannot. Unfortunately, they are the ones that are likely to be hit hardest by our excessive price levels. Rising fuel and food prices make life even more difficult for them. There are some things the government should do to help them, and some that it should not.</p> <p>On the one hand, the government cannot do anything to change international oil or food prices and should not try to control domestic ones. But, on the other hand, it can and should create a business environment in which competition is encouraged and taxes are low. For example, it helps parents if they can buy school uniform skirts for their girls for \u00a32 from Asda or 10 fish fingers from Sainsbury's for 49p, but opening a new supermarket is a nightmarish process under English planning law. Another example: while we are all complaining about high fuel prices, the state deserves at least half of the blame. At current prices, almost 60 per cent of the price of a litre of petrol is made up of fuel duty and VAT.</p> <p>High taxes and complex regulations have both contributed to the phenomenon of rip-off Britain. In particular, a lack of land supply due to planning constraints has pushed up land prices. But somebody has to pay for this, and in the end it is consumers that are footing the bill for our failed planning policies.</p> <p>If we care about our quality of life and the cost of living taxes and regulation should be tackled. In the meantime, there is only one way to get my favourite Ikea biscuits at a reasonable price: buy them when I next visit Germany.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Dr Oliver Marc Hartwich is the chief economist at Policy Exchange</p>",
  "<p>Police have rounded up more than a hundred foreign and Chinese Olympic ticket touts in a series of raids across the capital, officials said yesterday. The crackdown followed reports of seats for big events selling for up to 40 times their original price. </p> <p>Britons have been among those accused of being leading ticket touts. Under Chinese law, anyone caught selling tickets illegally can be detained for up to 15 days.</p> <p>Wang Wenjie, a senior officer with the city's public security bureau, told China Daily that 340 tickets were confiscated and all of the suspects were taken to police stations for questioning. He said police were putting up posters in both Chinese and English to warn people off the trade. </p> <p>The round-up appeared to have had some effect yesterday with fewer foreign touts around the main Olympic area and Chinese dealers appearing to seek a lower profile; by nightfall, they had disappeared. The crackdown does not seem to have affected the internet trade.</p> <p>Regulations allow normal tickets to be sold on to others - but not at a mark-up. Few have paid attention to that important caveat. For much of last week, touts from around the world haunted the area around the Olympic stadium with books full of yellow tickets. Canadians, Cockneys, Danes and Liverpudlians rubbed shoulders. </p> <p>Some Chinese dealers sported tattoos and worked in groups, suggesting they could be from the country's large criminal underworld. One, who gave only his surname, Liu, was asking 4,000 yuan (\u00a3312) for tickets to yesterday's 100m final, but eventually came down to 2,000 yuan.</p> <p>Another scalper, who only gave his surname Zhao, said: 'We never worry that we will end up with unsold tickets on our hands. The only concern is that we can't get enough. All the tickets are 100 per cent real. No one would dare to sell fakes. It would be more serious than selling drugs.'</p> <p>It is not clear where the tickets come from - 'someone inside', one tout said, without elaborating - though some seem to be unwanted corporate bookings. Beijingers scrambled to buy tickets when they went on sale, yet the week has seen empty blocks of seats in many venues.</p> <p>But the prices are too high for many hopefuls. A taxi driver named Mr Wang shrugged sadly after failing to get a ticket for the swimming arena for 1,000 yuan despite asking around for more than an hour. 'They want at least 2,000,' he said. 'That is more than half what I earn in a month.'</p> <p>Ticket touting dogs most big sporting events; several Britons were deported from Australia after they were caught at the Sydney Olympics in 2000.</p> <p>But the temptation to resell tickets may be particularly pronounced in China thanks to their low face value, with more than half of the seats costing less than 100 yuan (\u00a37.80).</p> <p>While the outlook may have been gloomy for scalpers, Beijing otherwise enjoyed glorious weather with a second day of clear, blue skies, pollution readings well below their normal level and mild temperatures ideal for track and field events.</p> <p>China's Olympic organisers shrugged off protests in Beijing. He Zhenliang, honorary chairman of China's Olympic committee, told reporters: 'You see how harmonious it is in the Olympic village? You see all stadiums in Beijing are full of joy and enthusiasm? When you see the emotion shown by athletes when they win ... I believe you will feel the world has hope. Beautiful and good things in the world far exceed evil and dark things.'</p>",
  "<p>With the notable exception of Pascal Cygan, you can almost always depend on Ars\u00e8ne Wenger to import something vintage from France. Samir Nasri's creativity, energy and attacking instincts were an instant hit in north London.</p> <p>Which was just as well. Without the finishing touch he supplied in the fourth minute, Arsenal would have started the season wholly embarrassed by West Brom. Back in the sunshine of the top flight after two years' exile in which they earned the reputation for aesthetic football not dissimilar to their hosts, West Brom had to demonstrate another critical quality. It needed character to find their Premier League bearings after an opening half-hour in which they were overrun and overawed. They summoned enough of it so that few would have been surprised had Albion pegged Arsenal back.</p> <p>Wenger included. 'We had that old story where you feel you deserve to be punished in the last minute,' he admitted during a post-match grilling from the tabloid journalists that might have turned a less confident man a darker shade of rare a mere 90 minutes into the new campaign.</p> <p>A weird transference happened in the second half as Arsenal - who began typically easy on the eye and possessive of the ball - became as anxious and sketchy as West Brom had been initially. The visitors duly wrestled control and were able to expose the faults in Arsenal's make-up.</p> <p>Emmanuel Ebou\u00e9 in central midfield? When the man who last season inspired equal frustration whether detailed to play as a right-back or right-winger is required to fill in for the injured Cesc F\u00e1bregas, you know there is a ticking time bomb in that most crucial of positions.</p> <p>Starting a campaign without key personnel and with others in questionable form (Emmanuel Adebayor put in a lazy display and substitute Robin van Persie was predictably rusty), Nasri's classy debut was particularly welcome.</p> <p>Naturally reticent to pay too much attention to the 'new Zidane' sobriquet, the \u00a311m signing from Marseille showed flashes to suggest he may blossom into a new Pires here. Within four minutes he was at the end of a move that zipped crisply via Nicklas Bendtner's tap, Ga\u00ebl Clichy's overlapping gallop and Denilson's cutback. Nasri side-footed in with the kind of authority in front of goal his predecessor Alexander Hleb seldom managed.</p> <p>'Nasri is an intelligent player with good technique and he worked hard for the team,' praised Wenger. 'Plus he added something people wanted from him in France - to score goals.'</p> <p>At the end of the first half, the only discomfort for Arsenal was that nagging feeling that they really should have had a healthier advantage. Albion's new goalkeeper Scott Carson had some hairy moments but was not troubled as much as Wenger would have liked.</p> <p>West Brom's recovery was impressive. They became competitive, began to express themselves and the attacking partnership of Ishmael Miller and Kim Do...#8209;Heon was promising. That combination forced Albion's first genuine threat, in the classic big-man-little-man mould. Miller's immense power unnerved Arsenal's defence and the 21-year-old, the most dangerous forward on the pitch in the end, came close to equalising in the second half with a low drive Manuel Almunia did well to parry. Paul Robinson's follow-up was cleared off the line by Johan Djourou.</p> <p>Tony Mowbray was right to focus on the positives afterwards. 'In preparation for the game you run all the scenarios through your head and one of them is a good hiding,' he said. 'We could have been in trouble, yet but for a decent save by their keeper and a clearance off the line it might have been 1-1. We've earned the right to be here and we will compete in every match.' To that end, he underlined his hopes to strengthen his squad by four extra bodies before the transfer window closes.</p> <p>West Brom's noisy fans may not have had anything tangible to cheer, but they journeyed home hopeful of some rewards ahead.</p> <p>As for Arsenal, it is hard to envisage either Manchester United or Chelsea having also to field four teenagers with precious little top-flight experience on their bench. Asked if he could afford to go another season without a trophy, Wenger gave a passionate defence of his approach. 'We won the trophy as the most unlucky team last year considering we had very bad injuries for a very long time to Van Persie, [Tomas] Rosicky and Eduardo. We made 83 points and lost only three games - 83 points would have been enough to be champions everywhere in Europe.'</p> <p>Wenger proclaimed himself perfectly satisfied with a week in which Arsenal made a winning start in the League and Champions League. 'What is a trophy?' he asked cryptically. 'Is to finish 12th and win the Carling Cup a trophy? It takes five games, sometimes against second-division teams, to win the Carling Cup. For me, the real quality of a team is to fight for the championship.'</p> <p>Three points down, 80-odd to go. </p> <p><strong>THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT</strong></p> <p><strong>Louise Cowburn, Observer reader</strong><br>It was a bit disappointing, but at least we won. Clichy was fantastic, up and down the pitch, giving Nasri a platform. Nasri was excellent on his debut, but we did miss F\u00e1bregas. Adebayor was booed, which was shocking \u2013 I'd never heard that before from an Arsenal crowd, even though some responded by cheering him. He wasn't booed to start with, but people got frustrated by his shooting and there was muttering then boos. As the game wore on he got more selfish to try to score to shut the boos up. Gallas was a bit moody and I'm not sure if he's the best player to be captain. Almunia was more reassuring than Lehmann, while Walcott was good, but petered out \u2013 like the rest of the team.</p> <p><strong>The fan's player ratings</strong> Almunia 8; Sagna 7, Gallas 7, Djourou 6, Clichy 9; Walcott 7 (Tour\u00e9 6), Ebou\u00e9 7, Denilson 8, Nasri 9; Bendtner 7 (Van Persie 6), Adebayor 5</p> <p><strong>Terry Wills, Baggies@yahoogroups.com</strong><br>I thought beforehand we'd lose 2-0 and we certainly were not embarrassed. In the first 20 minutes the players looked out of their depth, and Arsenal were sharper and quicker. But then we came into it and it was pretty even to half time. In the second half, Arsenal did waste a couple of chances and we came more into it, causing one or two awkward moments. But the one thing we must not do in the Premier League is give the ball away. All in all, it's not a bad first day, despite losing. We can take heart from the performance and enjoyed the occasion. </p> <p><strong>The fan's player ratings</strong> Carson 6; Hoefkens 4, Barnett 6, M\u00e9\u00eft\u00e9 5, Robinson 5, Brunt 5 (Beattie n/a); Morrison 5, Greening 7, Kim 6, Cech 4 (MacDonald n/a), Miller 7 (Bednar 4)</p> <p><strong><em>To take part in the fans' verdict, email fans@observer.co.uk</em></strong></p>",
  "<p>On the day when Louis Smith could win Britain's first Olympic individual gymnastics medal for 100 years, the president of British Gymnastics says his sport could go into free fall ahead of the London 2012 Games because of a lack of government-backed funding.</p> <p>Despite Britain's competitors recording the nation's best Olympic performances since early last century, there are serious misgivings over support for elite gymnasts and facilities. Brian Stocks, the sport's top official, heavily criticised the lack of investment and branded the level of support for the country's cramped, dilapidated gymnastics centres as 'appalling and atrocious'. </p> <p>The world championships will be staged next year at the O2 arena in south-east London. The closest purpose-built gymnastics centre to the arena - and the closest to the Olympic site for 2012 - is the Europa Gym in Erith, a few miles farther east, whose future is in doubt.</p> <p>The Europa Gym is operated by elite-performance coach Yvonne Arnold, who captained Britain's 1972 Olympic gymnasts. She sold her house in 2002 to ensure Europa's future and with her husband, Len, also a coach, now lives at the gym, managing and maintaining it while also training Olympic hopefuls.</p> <p>'We're panicking about the next two years,' Arnold told Observer Sport. 'The landlords are going to raise the lease to \u00a375,000 in 2010 from \u00a355,000. They want to get us out so they can charge a commercial rent - \u00a3120,000. We're completely self-sustaining and receive no outside funding.' </p> <p>Europa's turnover is around \u00a3250,000, which is raised from gym classes, along with revenue from boxing, weightlifting, karate, aikido and street-dancing clubs. 'It's chicken-egg. We can't apply for funding because we haven't got a long-term lease. But if we received funding we could pay for a long-term lease,' Arnold says. Sport England, the body that allocates funds for facilities, would require a 21-year tenancy to award the \u00a350,000 needed.</p> <p>Europa's floor area is also too small to meet criteria demanded by Sport England. 'We're the biggest and closest gym to the O2, just 20 minutes away, and do our best, but this is no proper training facility. We have one girl, Sophie Brandish, who's 15 and could compete in 2012, but unless my husband is there to watch she can't practise tumbling in case she goes straight out the window. It's devastating.' </p> <p>It is a similar story at gyms around the country including Huntingdon, home club of Smith - who competes in the pommel final at lunchtime today - and Daniel Keatings, who was 20th in the all-around final in Beijing.</p> <p>'Louis [Smith] will be sprinting down the runway and there'll be five-year-old girls who might wander into his path. The run-up to the vault should be 25 metres but it's 18, and the floor space is up against the beam, which is next to the pit,' says Erica Mackenzie, Huntingdon's manager. </p> <p>'We have 13 elite boys and girls, and a waiting list of 500 children. We want to build an extension [costing \u00a34.5m] and Sport England were going to give \u00a3500,00, but because we couldn't raise the other \u00a34m that money has now gone.' </p> <p>Neil Burton, British Gymnastics' facility developer, says Sport England policies ensure funds are used properly, but he is critical of the government finance available. 'We had just \u00a3600,000 in our direct control for each of the last four years.' That would not cover even half the costs of running a basic training gym in London.</p> <p> Stocks is more direct about the struggle gyms face. 'We've set sail in a sieve and are spending money trying to patch the holes. You'd think gyms like those Yvonne and Len run would get help. It's atrocious and appalling - they're experienced coaches, but there's a serious lack of investment. </p> <p>'Nationally, we have 200,000 on the waiting list to join our 1,800 clubs. In 1972, when Olga Korbut inspired everyone at the Munich Games, it took eight years for the government to catch up and start building facilities.'</p> <p>Despite the success of Smith, Keatings and Becky Downie, 12th in the women's all-around final on Friday, British Gymnastics does not expect a marked increase in the next award from Sport England, which gave \u00a3210m to 37 sports last year.</p> <p>Stocks claims there is further uncertainty. 'We're coming out of Beijing unable to award four-year contracts instantly to our elite-performance directors and coaches because the [funding] decision is not taken until April 2009,' he said of UK Sport, which allocates finance for elite programmes and gave gymnastics \u00a39,036,000 during the current cycle. 'They may walk away before then. If we don't get enough we'll be in free fall.'</p>",
  "<p>Whenever, as a minister in the Scottish Executive, my wife thought I was burning the candle at both ends, she had two ripostes to encourage a proper sense of perspective. She would remind me that 'graveyards are full of indispensable people' or she would speculate that, should I die, tributes would last for a day, but by the time friends and colleagues gathered in Orkney's St Magnus Cathedral for my funeral, the main buzz of conversation would be about the possible byelection candidates.</p> <p>Her speculation has been well borne out by the column inches devoted to the political implications of the byelection now pending, following the death of Glenrothes MP John MacDougall, after a long battle against mesothelioma, and to which, mea culpa, I am now adding.</p> <p>I can't claim to have known John MacDougall well. He entered the Commons at the 2001 election, at which I stood down. But the Scottish political village is small and I had encountered the then leader of Fife council on a number of occasions. He was a determined fighter for his native Fife and a fine example of someone who sought to give substance to his political beliefs through decades of public service. He was politically streetwise and would not have been the least surprised by the speculation and analysis of the political landscape as another Scottish byelection looms.</p> <p>This will be this parliament's third Scottish byelection. In February 2006, when Tony Blair still reigned in Downing Street, Labour lost Dunfermline &amp; West Fife (a seat only separated from Glenrothes by Gordon Brown's own constituency). There, Liberal Democrats overturned a Labour majority of more than 11,500. Last month, the Scottish Nationalists achieved a 22 per cent swing to win Labour's third-safest Scottish seat in Glasgow East.</p> <p>Conventional political wisdom - or at least the bookmakers - makes the SNP odds-on favourites to win Glenrothes, where a swing of just over 14 per cent is needed. Recent byelection history apart, the comparable Scottish Parliament seat of Central Fife was gained last year by the SNP, and Scotland's proportional voting system for council elections has resulted in a number of SNP councillors as well as SNP-Lib Dem control of the Fife council. It is a measure of Labour's plight in Scotland that, should it lose the byelection, Gordon Brown would be the party's only MP in Fife.</p> <p>It's not surprising, therefore, that there has been much commentary on the Prime Minister's dilemma. Does he call the byelection promptly - like Crewe &amp; Nantwich, where the writ was moved even before the funeral, or Glasgow East, where a Scotland Office minister said it was important that the constituency should not be deprived of an MP for any length of time? Or does he play it long, hoping that the burden of expectation may lead the SNP to slip up, but at the risk of derailing an attempted autumn relaunch strategy, should the seat be lost?</p> <p>Then there is the question of a candidate. In Glasgow East, former minister Margaret Curran was possibly the best candidate who could be fielded, but the debacle which preceded her emergence scarcely enhanced Labour's chances. Surely Labour will sort out its candidate selection in Glenrothes before the election is called? At which point, cue Henry McLeish, former Scottish First Minister and former MP for the area.</p> <p>Admittedly, it depends on which daily newspaper you read. While one speculates on the possibility of McLeish standing, another reports Scottish Labour MPs lining up to give the suggestion a deafening raspberry.</p> <p>Following his resignation as First Minister in 2001 over an expenses row - a 'muddle', not a 'fiddle' - McLeish kept a low profile. But in recent months, he has been seeking again some of the political limelight. SNP First Minister Alex Salmond appointed him to the Scottish government's commission on broadcasting, then asked him to chair an inquiry into Scotland's prisons. McLeish has also been to the fore in calling for engagement in the Scottish government's national conversation on Scotland's constitutional future.</p> <p>Some of his critics have described him as a crypto-nationalist. But his supporters suggest that, having enjoyed Salmond's approbation, it would be difficult for the SNP to attack him effectively in a byelection. Don't believe it. Mr Salmond himself may find it difficult to be too critical, but it's a safe bet that on the doorsteps, SNP activists would not hesitate to remind voters of the circumstances of Henry's earlier departure.</p> <p>But what may also spike a McLeish candidacy is his unequivocal call for the Scottish Labour party to enjoy much greater autonomy from Westminster, and for the party's new leader in Scotland (or, to be strictly accurate, the leader of the Labour group in the Scottish Parliament) to have much wider authority than at present. Given the divisions which this issue causes, especially between Labour MPs and MSPs, journalists would have a field day asking visiting MPs, ministers, and even the Prime Minister, whether they support their candidate's view on this key internal issue.</p> <p>While scarcely the talking point on the doorsteps, the balance of power between Labour at Holyrood and Labour at Westminster is increasingly seen by many as key to whether Labour can revive its fortunes north of the border. A former minister, Tom McCabe, has complained that many of his London-based colleagues have not come to terms with the realities of devolution. He fears, for example, that Labour in Scotland will be unable to address the 'discredited nature' of the council tax as long as it has to refrain from rocking the boat elsewhere in the UK. The reformers argue that Labour cannot compete on equal terms with the SNP if scope for deviating from the party line is so limited. In response, Glasgow MP and minister Tom Harris claims that greater authority for a Scottish Labour leader is wholly impractical.</p> <p>And this, after all, is an issue on which McLeish has form. As First Minister, along with his Lib Dem coalition partners and in the teeth of opposition from many in his own party, he pursued the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. But the success was followed by the dogged determination of the Treasury not to remit to Scotland the benefit savings the policy produced.</p> <p>More recently, on the eve of last year's Scottish Parliament elections, the then Health Minister Andy Kerr announced that the Scottish government would honour, in full, a nurses' pay award. This was in contrast to the Whitehall decision to stage the increases. Surely with the sum fully budgeted for, and an election imminent, it made political sense to agree to a full settlement. By all accounts, the reaction from 11 Downing Street to the devolved government asserting its own choice was volcanic. It is, perhaps, little wonder that of the three contenders for 'leadership of the Labour Group at Holyrood', Kerr is the most vocal in support of strengthening the Scottish party's autonomy.</p> <p>Arguably, the leadership election itself is, in part, a consequence of the tensions evident between Holyrood and Westminster. A number of factors led to Wendy Alexander's resignation, but her unilateral call to 'bring on' a referendum on Scottish independence, coupled with the obvious lack of support from the Prime Minister, undermined her leadership yet further.</p> <p>From earliest days, Labour found it difficult to come to terms with the consequences of devolution. Six months after the Parliament was established, at a meeting with Tony Blair, Donald Dewar and I described our proposals for the abolition of university tuition fees in Scotland. It was like watching the proverbial penny drop. What he, no doubt, had intellectually rationalised was now a political reality.</p> <p>But judging by the comments of some within the Labour party, the advocates of reform have an uphill task. For some, there is yet to be an intellectual understanding of what devolving power really means, let alone a coming to terms with its practical and political consequences.</p> <p>What do they fear? Do they ever talk to members of their sister party, the SPD, in Germany regarding the realities of exercising policy levers at different levels without the heavens crashing in? Why do some of their leadership candidates give the impression of wanting to tiptoe around the issue? To an outsider, especially from a party with full freedom to determine domestic policy in Scotland, it's a no-brainer.</p> <p>Labour deserves great credit for delivering a Scottish Parliament, in spite of nationalist taunts that they couldn't deliver a pizza. But it's a rich paradox that Labour could devolve power within a nation, while remaining incapable of devolving power within itself.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jim Wallace, the former leader of the Liberal Democrats in Scotland, will be writing a regular column on politics</p>",
  "<p>In the second half of the 18th century, a craze for authenticity swept European elites. Discerning people preferred sincerity to cleverness, the natural to the sophisticated, as they revolted against the cold scientific discoveries of the Enlightenment. Rousseau's praise for the honest virtues of simple peasants moved Marie Antoinette. She ordered architects to design the Hameau de la Reine in the grounds of Petit Trianon at Versailles and filled the surrounding fields with tame cows for the ladies of the court to milk with churns made of S\u00e8vres porcelain.</p> <p>The doomed queen's rustic 'cottage', which looked more like a manor house to outsiders, was one of European royalty's great PR disasters. As Simon Schama says in his history of the French Revolution, her beribboned cows and Alpine sheep 'were a sincere if disastrously misjudged attempt to cultivate the innocence of rural life amidst the pomposity of court protocol. In 1789, it would seem an obscene parody for Marie Antoinette to be playing shepherdess and boiling fresh eggs for breakfast when scarecrow peasants begged on the roads'.</p> <p>Prince Charles has his own Hameau de la Reine: Duchy Home Farm, which provides the organic ingredients for his Duchy Originals range of produce. Like Marie Antoinette, he sees the poor as happiest when they have their place in a natural order, with royalty at its head. </p> <p>Last week, he surpassed the Bourbons. Marie Antoinette never said: 'Let them eat cake' to the poor of her day, but Prince Charles was adamant that today's poor should eat organic. Despite all I have read by him over the years, it was still a shock to listen to the recording of the interview he gave the Daily Telegraph. This raging man, who searched for apocalyptic predictions of catastrophe, was not a street preacher at Hyde Park Corner, but our next head of state. </p> <p>'Millions of small farmers all over the world are being driven off their land into unsustainable, unmanageable, degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness,' he cried. Soon we will face 'the absolute destruction of everything'.</p> <p>Of everything, your highness? </p> <p>Yes, and another thing! If agribusinesses think they are going to prevent absolute destruction by using 'one form of clever genetic engineering after another', they will cause 'the biggest disaster environmentally of all time'.</p> <p>After that, Julie Burchill felt like sweet reason. In Not in my Name, her and Chas Newkey-Burden's spirited attack on modern hypocrisy, she declared: 'Green is the first sociopolitical movement in which every single leader and spokesperson is filthy rich - they make the Conservative party look like the Jarrow marchers.'</p> <p>With Lord Melchett, the Right Honourable Jonathon Porritt, George Monbiot and Zac Goldsmith, as well as Prince Charles, all holding prominent positions, the green movement is indeed where the concerned children of the upper class fled when the power of the House of Lords diminished. But Burchill and Newkey-Burden can't accept that just because the greenery appeals to the aristocracy does not mean it is always wrong. Global temperatures are still rising, even if old Etonians say they are. The danger comes not when greens support science but when they ignore it.</p> <p>Tellingly, Prince Charles has little to say about climate change, the one argument greens have won decisively. Instead, he prefers to concentrate his attacks on GM food with a Bourbon disregard for the consequences for the poor. It's too early to be sure, but can we now at least agree that there is a fair chance that Europe's panic about GM foods will be seen by historians as an explosion of irrationality as foolish as the manias about the MMR vaccine and millennium bug? </p> <p>The Royal Society investigated in 2003 and found GM foods posed no greater threat to human health than other foods. The society has just begun a second inquiry, but no one expects its scientists to alter their conclusions. True, some GM crops may damage the environment, but as the Royal Society points out, others could help it by requiring fewer dosings of pesticides.</p> <p>I suspect the society is wasting its time because rich Europeans will not be convinced by evidence. Their objections are not rational but visceral. GM foods offend Europe's cult of the authentic, which is as strong now as in Marie Antoinette's day. The wealthy propagandise for 'natural' childbirth, even though genuinely 'natural' childbirth for most women in the poor world is about the most dangerous experience of their lives. They dine on 'natural' ingredients, even though natural farming for the majority of peasant farmers is backbreaking drudgery. </p> <p>Europe's prejudices wouldn't matter if the world's population weren't shooting up, taking food prices with it. The only solutions are a global socialist revolution to redistribute wealth (unlikely) or farmers using new technologies to grow more food. Paul Collier, professor of economics at Oxford University, compares Brazil, where large agro-companies produce surpluses for the world market, with Africa, where aid policies have concentrated on keeping small peasant farms in business. </p> <p>'Unfortunately,' he sighed, 'large-scale commercial agriculture is unromantic. We laud the production style of the peasant: environmentally sustainable and human in scale. In respect of manufacturing and services, we grew out of this fantasy years ago, but in agriculture it continues to contaminate our policies.'</p> <p>Now suppose he and the Royal Society are wrong. There would still be something repellent about Prince Charles's behaviour. Constitutional propriety demands that he stays out of politics, yet he intervenes in a political debate on the side of those who want to limit food production at a time of growing hunger. He does not propose optional means of increasing supplies by, say, clearing forests to establish new organic farms. He does not even recognise that there is a need to increase supplies. </p> <p>I am not saying that he will share the fate of Marie Antoinette, merely that British republicans should take heart from his outbursts. The reign of Charles III will not be a happy one for the monarchy. He lacks the self-discipline to be king.</p>",
  "<p>Russia's answer to Terence Conran, Moscow's most successful restaurateur, is as smooth as they come. Arkady Novikov, 46, exudes quiet charisma, dresses like Tom Ford (navy designer jeans; pressed, open-necked shirt) and has the hair and smile of George Clooney. We meet in London in his favourite hang-out, the Blue Bar at the Berkeley Hotel - where he always stays when he's in town.</p> <p>Novikov is the sort of man for whom life is a parade of luxury. He is in London en route to Italy to check out his latest purchase: Villa Fontanelle, the late Gianni Versace's Lake Como home, 30 miles from Milan, which he bought earlier this year for \u00a326 million. It was reported that he paid \u00a33 million over the asking price to have it taken off the market. 'There's a lot to do. The place needs a lot of renovation,' he smiles, coyly. Fortunately Novikov is not a man who is afraid of hard work.</p> <p>Russia's so-called 'blini baron' launched his restaurant empire with a loan of $50,000 in the early days of perestroika, shortly after being turned down for a chef's job in the first Moscow branch of McDonald's. Fifteen years on he owns 47 concept restaurants featuring 18 cuisines and employing 13,800 staff. Another three openings are planned for later this year. He also owns Yolki-Palki, a chain of 30 much-loved affordable nostalgic Russian eateries, and counts Putin and his wife as personal friends: he often caters at the Kremlin.</p> <p>Novikov's personal fortune is unknown, but five years ago Gourmet magazine estimated he was doing about $30 million-worth of business a year. In 2006 the Novikov Restaurant Group listed its revenue as $180 million. Every time he opens a restaurant it instantly becomes the place to go, the road outside blocked with luxury cars, the chauffeurs watching DVDs into the early hours in the back seats while their employers party. GQ Bar, which he opened last year with a permanent staff of 300, remains the hottest venue in town.</p> <p>When GQ Bar featured on the Manchester United website during Moscow's European Cup in May, it became a place of pilgrimage: British fans drank the ultra-glamorous gentlemen's club dry of lager in the space of an hour, causing chaos and somewhat lowering the designer tone. (Novikov's regulars are more likely to drink Californian chardonnay.) Its popularity is rivalled only by Nedalny Vostok, another recent launch of Novikov, an Asian fusion restaurant whose stylish interior was masterminded by Super Potato, the Japanese cult designers behind Zuma and Roka in London.</p> <p>Alongside Novikov's home in Sardinia (next door to the villa of Roman Abramovich's girlfriend Daria Zhukova), the Villa Fontanelle project is a treat for all his years of hard work - but it also represents a departure. Because Novikov is taking stock and setting his sights beyond Russia: he is in the early stages of planning an opening in Milan and has his eye ultimately on London. He has already sold off part of the company (shares in Yolki-Palki, his budget chain) to fund his new plans.</p> <p>Opening restaurants outside Moscow will be a break for him, he jokes, as it's the hardest-partying city in the world. 'Moscow is divided into two halves. People who go to restaurants, dress fashionably and want \"tusovka\" (a good time). And then there are the people who want to eat. Most Russians put themselves firmly in the first category. That's how we're different to the rest of Europe. When foreigners turn up they are in a state of shock that everything is so glamorous and over the top. Moscow has had a very short time to learn lessons which Europe learnt decades ago. But it is still very much Russia: people dress differently and behave differently. For us, eating out is all about beautiful people wearing beautiful clothes.' And, he could add, splashing lots of cash. As Jay Rayner writes in his chapter on Moscow in The Man Who Ate the World, Moscow is a place where it is 'not uncommon to see someone drop a five-hundred-dollar tip'.</p> <p>Moscow can be a terrifyingly expensive place to eat out for the penny-pinching foreigner - which is largely down to Novikov. He is playing to a local audience who don't mind paying over the odds - indeed they would be suspicious of anything affordable. Even one of his own staff tells me, 'There is nothing in Moscow for the middle classes.' It is possible to eat affordably at Novikov's restaurants (ie, for about \u00a360 a head) but only if you're very careful what you choose and don't even look at the wine list. If you want an unrestrained pick of the menu, you'll easily drop \u00a3100-plus a head without even thinking about it.</p> <p>The good news is that it's worth it: I have eaten at over a dozen of Novikov's restaurants (usually on a Russian friend's tab) and they always live up to their reputation. I have tried the legendary crispy crab sticks with ginger mayo at Nedalny Vostok and the wild-strawberry soup at Bisquit. I always drink water out of respect for my friends' generosity, though. On my last visit to Nedalny Vostok I noted there was a 2005 Montrachet burgundy on the menu for 59,500 roubles (about \u00a31,200) and one of the cheapest wines was a riesling for 4,900 roubles a bottle (scary enough at \u00a3105, thanks).</p> <p>The people Novikov caters for make up the elite - which is a big class in Moscow, if not the rest of Russia. But he has a democratic side: he invented the concept behind Yolki-Palki, his fast-food chain where a bellyful of borscht, mushroom pies, meat-filled blinis, Russian beer and curd-cheese dessert will set you back less than \u00a310 a head. It is the one place in Moscow where you can order food and drink without fear of bankruptcy. This alone makes you think that Novikov must have a heart.</p> <p>Versace villas notwithstanding, he does seem to see himself as a man of simple tastes. 'I love bread!' he exclaims, licking his lips and rubbing his belly like a greedy child. 'My mouth is watering just talking about it. Yesterday I had the most delicious tea of bread, butter and honey in one of my restaurants. The bread must have a good crust, though, and it must be rye bread,' he frowns. His favourite foods are from his childhood: sweet black cherries and apricots: 'They were rare delicacies. There was not much fruit around when I was a boy.' </p> <p>One of Novikov's claims to fame has been to put old Soviet favourites back on the menu: he waxes lyrical about okroshka, a cold soup made with kvass (a mildly alcoholic fermented rye bread drink) and khash, a fatty Armenian dish made with the feet, head and stomach of a cow. 'You must eat it in the morning with garlic and vodka. It's delicious.'</p> <p>Among his celebrity friends, Novikov has the George Clooney reputation to match the haircut: everyone loves him and declares him the most charming man on the Moscow circuit. But he has another side: his staff know him as exacting and demanding, as one might expect from a man who has played the Alan Sugar role during the first series of The Candidate, Russia's version of The Apprentice. (Interestingly, three years on, the female winner still works in his organisation.) Novikov is also something of a maverick. He famously has no office and works out of whatever restaurant he is most fixated upon at any given moment. He only hired a PR for the first time last year. And it is rumoured that he visits all 47 of his establishments at least once a week, unannounced. (Which is not logistically possible, of course - but the prospect of it must keep people on their toes.)</p> <p>Novikov's perfectionism came late in life. He grew up with a simmering resentment but no idea of what he wanted to do. His typical Soviet family was, he says, so ordinary that in fact they were probably worse off than most people. 'In those days there were people who were earning decent money and managing to travel. We were not among them,' he says solemnly. His father, who worked in an engineering factory, left when he was very young. He was raised by his mother, a kindergarten teacher, and his grandmother, who first taught him how to cook (reluctantly, as she considered it women's work). 'As a teenager he decided he was vaguely interested in road-building - 'because it seemed like a manly thing to do', he laughs - but failed the exams. In desperation he headed for Cookery School Number 174. 'At last I found something I loved.'</p> <p>He then spent two years in the army, where he was posted to Georgia and had time to think about his future. 'That was the school of hard knocks. I had to learn how to milk a cow, to scythe grass, to build houses and to shoot guns. I had my own army dog, a German shepherd. Happy days.' Back in Moscow he headed to an economics institute, where he met his wife, the modelesque Nadezhda, who runs Moscow's coolest floristry business, Studio 55. They have been married for 18 years and have a daughter, Aleksandra, 17, who is at school in London, and a son, Nikita, 11, who lives in Moscow.</p> <p>In his late 20s Novikov slowly worked out the business side of restaurants, gaining experience at Moscow's Hard Rock Cafe. 'I soon discovered that it was not about how good you were but how good your connections were. Then, thankfully, perestroika started.' He found his way into a failing Soviet cooperative and worked his way up to the position of manager. Then, in 1992, came his big break. The man in charge of the cooperative was a player who was expanding into private business: he offered Novikov a loan of $50,000 to set up in new premises.</p> <p>'To him, it was not a lot of money - he could afford to give it away. To me, it was such a ridiculously large sum of money that I didn't even really think about it. Because it didn't seem real to me. I was young and only now do I realise what a risk it was. I was an adventurer and I had a complete absence of doubt. I just knew in my mind that it was going to be a beautiful restaurant - the most expensive and the best. I was not afraid. The real heroine of the story is the woman responsible for the building who agreed to let us use the space. I have no idea why she took a gamble on me. She is the one I have to thank.'</p> <p>His first restaurant, Sirene - which is still open - was impossible to manage at first because of the supply problems of the perestroika years: 'There was no food, especially no meat, no forks... It was a nightmare. At first we couldn't actually cook anything at all.' Then he realised he could just send his chefs down to the open-air market to buy everything. And he made it into a seafood restaurant to get round the meat problem. </p> <p>A second venue, Club T, soon voted Moscow's best French restaurant, opened in an old Soviet furniture shop. Then came the legendary Tsarskaya Okhota (Tsar's Hunt) - a reproduction hunting lodge which served stodgy traditional Russian fare - just what the newly minted Moscow jet set wanted in 1996. After a month it had to close because it was too successful: there were queues every day and they couldn't get the food out of the kitchen fast enough. It re-opened as a help-yourself high-end Russian buffet - which, in a more affordable version, became the model for Yolki-Palki.</p> <p>One of the secrets of Novikov's success is that he seeks inspiration in Russian traditions and is not overawed by anything outside Moscow. He does love travel and new experiences, though. When asked his favourite cuisine, he lists about 15, from Italian to Japanese: 'I like them all. I don't want to offend anyone.' But he is Russian to his core. His first visit to London in 1995 (his first-ever visit abroad) he remembers as a distinct disappointment. </p> <p>'We came with a tour group to a horrible hotel next to a cemetery. All the Russian women in our group were wearing their furs and people just stared at us. Londoners dressed very strangely - I remember seeing people wearing platform shoes and with these awful haircuts. I was in shock. We ate at Beefeater and it was terrible.' These days he is more at home here and declares himself obsessed with Pret A Manger, The River Caf\u00e9, The Square and Zuma.</p> <p>Despite his expansion plans, his comrades are still the Holy Grail of clients for him. 'Russians are the most demanding customers in the world,' he says, wistfully, and with more than a hint of pride. 'They always want the best and they have tried everything. They just love going out.' The problem is, they are so sophisticated now that they are developing more Western tastes. He adds, sadly: 'They don't throw money around in the way they used to, you know.' </p> <h2>Novikov's top 10 favourite restaurants in Moscow</h2> <p>To be fair, it would be almost impossible to choose 10 good restaurants in Moscow that did not belong to Arkady Novikov, seeing as he does have something of a monopoly. So here they are:</p> <p>1. <strong>GQ Bar</strong></p> <p>5 Ulitsa Baltchug, 00 7 495 956 7775. Moscow's most popular hang-out and Novikov's biggest success so far.

  "<p>Few famous figures manage to capture the nation's attention each time they open their mouth but, unwittingly or otherwise, Jeremy Paxman has perfected the art of getting noticed. The Newsnight presenter's pronouncements on everything from underpants to angling are eagerly gobbled up by the media and the public, even if some of them can be painful to digest - his latest musings, on Scottish poet Robert Burns, have enraged an entire country. </p> <p>'The extraordinary thing is whatever he says becomes front page news,' says a former colleague. 'There does seem to be a sort of national fascination with him. Somehow - whether by accident or design - he has created a persona that is far more interesting than the programme he presents.'</p> <p>Paxman's disparaging comments about Burns are contained in the preface to a new edition of the Chambers Dictionary, in which he dismisses the poet as 'a king of sentimental doggerel'. Chambers defines 'doggerel' simply as 'badly written poetry'. Paxman must have known that his statement would play badly north of the border and it doesn't help that he has 'form' with the Scots. After a heated exchange with former Home Secretary John Reid three years ago, he joked: 'Down here, we live under a sort of Scottish Raj. I don't see why there is any reason for them to feel chippy.' </p> <p>His verdict on Burns might not have been a calculated dig, though it cannot have been an entirely casual aside since it came in a written piece. But it has provoked uproar in the poet's homeland, prompting a spokesman for First Minister Alex Salmond to describe Paxman as a 'gowk', a word that can't be found in Chambers but translates as a simpleton or fool. </p> <p>Even Paxman's detractors would concede that he is no dunce. Born in Leeds in 1950, he was educated at Malvern College in Worcestershire, a minor public school, and St Catharine's College Cambridge, where he read English, before joining the BBC. He served a tough apprenticeship, reporting from Northern Ireland for three years in the mid-1970s, at the height of the Troubles, and went on to work as a reporter on current affairs shows Tonight and Panorama. But it was BBC2's Newsnight that made him a household name, providing him with the perfect platform to hone his haranguing interview style and showcase his trademark sneer. </p> <p>Paxman interviews are visually arresting, partly because his facial expressions convey incredulity and contempt at every turn, but it is a childlike inability to avoid asking awkward questions, which one former colleague describes as a form of 'diplomatic incontinency' that helps to keep Paxman in the public eye after nearly 20 years presenting the same show: 'He's unable to let things go past and keep his counsel. That's his genius as an interviewer and that's why he makes headlines.' </p> <p>Paxman's candour explains why he had no qualms about asking Charles Kennedy about his drink problem long before it was public knowledge, a line of questioning that was condemned at the time, but proved prescient when the former Liberal Democrat leader subsequently resigned over the issue. </p> <p>Not everyone is a fan of his abrasive style, however, and some insist Paxman's interview technique depends too much on bluster, turning his on-screen exchanges into a series of political Punch and Judy shows as uninformative as they are entertaining. </p> <p>There can be little doubt that his fame depends on the fact that he has turned political interviews into a spectator sport. The internet is awash with clips of his verbal punch-ups with heavyweights, including his infamous exchange with former Conservative leader Michael Howard, then Home Secretary, early in his Newsnight career. </p> <p>Paxman's propensity for kicking politicians has won him the admiration of the public and enabled him to become an unlikely antihero; an underdog who dresses in corduroys, brogues and check shirts, the uniform of the university-educated middle classes. He draws a BBC salary large enough (reportedly close to \u00a31m) to pay for a home near Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire. </p> <p>But his conventional appearance and background mean he appeals to the upper classes too, and there is an unspoken assumption among the liberal intelligentsia that he is one of them, despite the fact that clues about his political persuasion are thin on the ground. </p> <p>One journalist who has worked with him claims that Paxman has voted for every major political party at some point, although friends claim he is as cynical and sceptical about politics off screen as he is on it. </p> <p>He seems to relish his carefully cultivated image as an outsider and his status as an establishment pariah was confirmed when members of the Garrick prevented him from joining the exclusive London club, but those who know him say that is not an act. </p> <p>'I think he has always felt like an outsider and wanted to be on the outside,' says one. 'He is a rejecter of norms and conventional ways of thinking and that is why he has been so successful at what he does. I think he's always had a desire to rub against the grain right from his school and university days. That's his stock-in-trade on Newsnight.'</p> <p>Privately, say friends: 'He's fantastic company, terribly polite, slightly shy and very likable. He's not a rude person at all. He almost goes out of his way to be polite.' He also seems genuinely popular with work colleagues. 'He's very good to work with,' says one BBC insider. 'He is less fierce than some of the other egos. He protects those who are beneath him and bites the backsides of the bosses. He won't dump on people who are relatively junior. Most of his complaints are upwards rather than downwards and he is respected for that.'</p> <p>If he has enmities, they are based on professional rivalry rather than personal animus. 'He feels a bit threatened when he doesn't get his way,' says a BBC colleague, claiming that Paxman felt threatened when Jeremy Vine was appointed as his understudy. He once ended a show by saying, mischievously, that 'Newsnight will be back same time tomorrow, presented by the Sorcerer's Apprentice', but his status as a national figure synonymous with the programme means he is as indispensable as any TV presenter can be. Even his most capable co-presenters struggle to shine as brightly and BBC bosses fret about whether the show could survive when, and if, he departs. </p> <p>They privately concede that it would need to be rebuilt from scratch if he left, though there are few signs he is planning to do so, despite persistent rumours that he covets the Question Time chair. Paxman is said to have been handed a lucrative job presenting University Challenge by the BBC as a consolation prize after David Dimbleby succeeded Robin Day as the programme's host in 1994, and there have been other bust-ups. </p> <p>Earlier in his career, he was clearly unhappy about being sidelined during the BBC's election night coverage and still plays second fiddle to Dimbleby when the country goes to the polls. 'It's part of the constitution of this country that all events have to be presented by a Dimbleby,' he once remarked wryly. </p> <p>When he was given a walk-on part in the BBC's election night coverage in 1997, he excelled, asking Michael Portillo: 'Are you ready to drink hemlock?' and surprised Cecil Parkinson by asking him: 'You're the chairman of a fertiliser firm. How deep is the mess you're in at present?'</p> <p>According to a BBC insider: 'His coverage was much more memorable. The explanation that was give internally was that Paxman was too closely identified with BBC2, whereas Dimbleby is a BBC1 figure because of Question Time. They didn't think his attitude or style is mass market. He must have been irritated by that.' </p> <p>As he approaches his 60th birthday, however, he seems contented enough, according to friends. 'He shows no signs of going on to do anything else,' says one. 'He loves, lives and breathes Newsnight and as far as I can see doesn't want to move on.'</p> <p>His long association with the programme gives him clout, and enables him to get away with displays of on-air petulance that would not be tolerated in others. He famously detested reading the weather and rushed through the forecast at the end of the programme, to the amusement of viewers but the exasperation of his bosses. </p> <p>'They have to put up with all that stuff even if he's rapped on the knuckles,' says a BBC journalist, but some other offences are more serious. When Newsnight introduced a Scotland 'opt-out' halfway through the programme, Paxman deliberately talked over the link, forcing producers to choose between cutting him off in midflow or eating into Scottish air time. A BBC journalist describes that behaviour as 'perfectly mischievous', but there is another word for it, even if, unlike 'doggerel', it is unlikely ever to appear in the Chambers Dictionary: 'Paxmanesque'.</p> <h2>The Paxman lowdown</h2> <p><strong>Born </strong> Leeds, 1950.

  "<p><strong>Peter Bazalgette, media consultant, investor and former producer of Channel 4's Big Brother</strong></p> <p>As the channels of communication become more complex, and the TV schedule dies, the search to find a particular piece of content becomes more important. I'm all for less regulation, but search will be an Ofcom issue in the future. I'll be interested to see what Google does in the next two years to address society. Will it take on any additional public service responsibilities? Google is brilliant and a great public utility but don't assume it is going to be totally dominant in the future. It's going to face competition from companies that allow you to search for things in a different way. There will be increasingly sophisticated search engines that provide more informed, less broad-brush results. So Google may not be as dominant but it will still be a healthy business.</p> <p><strong>Kate Allen, director of Amnesty International UK</strong></p> <p>We have long-standing concerns about Google regarding the way it is betraying its own principles in going against established international norms around freedom of information. When you go on a Google search engine in London and look for a picture of Tiananmen Square, you get that iconic picture of a man standing in front of a tank. If you go to google.cn and do the same search you'll get a picture of happy smiley tourists. Specific words such as Tibet, democracy, Tiananmen Square are heavily censored. We think that filtering process should be transparent. The rest of us who know that we're using Google in an uncensored fashion have a duty to stand up for people who don't have that access.</p> <p><strong>Jeffrey Chester, director, Center for Digital Democracy, Washington</strong></p> <p>Google will be the most powerful media company in the 21st century, and they are really owed tremendous credit for that. But they are so well integrated into everyone's existence, and questions should be raised. They are expanding into mobile communications, which adds a whole new dimension - not only do they know your interests but they know where you are. Strong privacy policies enacted by the EU and the US are urgently required. Competition authorities should investigate Google's growing role as an online advertising gatekeeper. Our democratic future depends on the structure of the new media.</p> <p><strong>Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive, WPP advertising group </strong></p> <p>Copyright and fair payment for content are going to become more of an issue in the future. Also, as Google has become more and more dominant, people are becoming increasingly concerned about its market position. There are very few media owners that have 70 or 80 or 90 per cent market share, which they would if the Google-Yahoo! link in America becomes a reality. The most interesting thing is who will be the son or daughter of Google, and whether that will come from a Stanford or a Bangalore or Beijing. I think it's more likely to be the latter. Google's big challenge is the law of big numbers: can a $160bn company become a trillion dollar company?</p> <p><strong>Ashley Highfield, former director of BBC Future Media &amp; Technology and BBC iPlayer mastermind, now CEO Kangaroo</strong></p> <p>People are terribly peripatetic in the online world; there is very little loyalty, particularly to search brands. If somebody else comes up with a better mousetrap then the audience will use that service instead of Google's. The web world shows that products do go through generations, and I think you could argue that Google's now looking quite Web 1.0 and maybe hasn't embraced a number of the emerging Web 2.0 features. The future's going to be in layering on top of Google more understanding of the context of the user and the question - the 'semantic web', without getting too cyberbollocks about the whole thing.</p> <p><strong>Adam Curtis, director of TV documentary on terrorism, The Power of Nightmares</strong></p> <p>The millions of searches that engines like Google record and store reveal the shifting desires and fears of individuals. They're leading to a new fragmented sensibility among millions of people in the way they see and experience the world. Machines like Google know something about us as human beings that we really don't want to know - that we are not individuals: 'If you like this then you will like that...'. So Google is a paradox. It gives us the feeling we are wild and free individuals, powerfully reinforcing an idea of us as heroic figures in the consumer age. Yet at the same time it is powerfully proving the opposite - that we are completely predictable. Out of that is going to come some very interesting political ideas of how to organise society and also new artistic ideas. The really interesting question is whether it is really a cult....</p>",
  "<p>Let's speculate wildly. Let's say that one of Labour's aspirant leaders for post-Gordon times has a mistress and a gallant, terminally sick wife. Perhaps he also has an illegitimate baby. Some 'trash tabloid' gets hold of this tawdry triangle and prepares to print. Here's an eerie replica of John Edwards's joust with the National Enquirer, except we're talking South Hampstead not South Carolina. So, in new, privacy-constrained, Britain, what would the press do next?</p> <p>We know exactly what a much less constrained American press didn't do for nine months about Edwards and Rielle Hunter, of course. They sniffed loftily and looked away. They let Edwards gather enough delegates in Iowa to knock the early stuffing from Hillary's campaign. They ignored the Enquirer, and attendant blogosphere debate. They investigated feebly, if at all. And now - day after day - they self-flagellate amid guilt and justification. Internal absorption as usual, in short. </p> <p>But, legally, they had few problems. All the news they deemed fit they could print. In Mr Justice Eady-land UK, however, things might be very different.</p> <p>First, a little prior restraint as our aspirant leader senses reporters following his trail. Find a judge and get an injunction against printing or repeating the essence of any tale. There might be a libel angle of opportunity available, of course (three cheers for the UN human rights committee that dubs our libel laws a disgrace). But privacy still looks a much neater bet in the wake of Eady's gag on the husband of a nightclub singer who wanted to cause a public fuss because his wife was having an affair with an anonymous sports personality. Shy sportsman, remember, got his gag because his own unknowing wife and children deserved protection of their privacy. Save them and me from my sins, in short. Injunction granted. No complaining cuckolds allowed.</p> <p>And, thereafter, in the steps of Max Mosley, many avenues of opportunity open wide. Does the mistress have children? Then she's got a whole gamut of privacy claims to pursue. (Ms Hunter, remember, is refusing to let her baby's DNA be tested, citing the 'P' word yet again.) Can it be shown beyond doubt that a private liaison has passed public interest tests? Not necessarily, if the pair met in an off-duty bar a couple of years ago (the Edwards scenario). Not, perhaps, if the politician's own wife and family needed shielding from publicity.</p> <p>The problem, post-Mosley, is that nothing is certain or foreseeable; everything is infernally complicated. Common sense might follow the Edwards line, pithily put by Mickey Kaus of Slate magazine: 'If a politician whose chief appeal is his self-advertised loyalty to his brave, ill wife cheats on his brave, ill wife, what's he good for again?' But there is increasingly scant common sense on offer here.</p> <p>The British chill, often praised around distinguished dinner tables, is to clamp down on kiss-and-tell stuff (nights of feverish passion with footballers and the like). The difficulty, however, without an American First Amendment to assert the public's unequivocal right to know, is that privacy increasingly trumps the need to be well informed. </p> <p>Neither Edwards nor Hunter held public office when their affair began. She joined his campaign - and wasn't paid from public funds. Translate such difficulties to the law courts in the Strand and imponderability grows. </p> <p>Yet can you really say that Gary Hart's fling with Donna Rice, long ago, wasn't relevant to his pitch for the White House? That the Governor of New York's sexual adventures in a Washington hotel a few months ago didn't affect his fitness for office? That Bill and Monica were privacy incarnate? There's nothing easy about the home-grown decisions in Eadyland. But every fresh twist makes them harder to understand (and, sometimes, bear).</p> <h2>One trade paper, three trades</h2> <p>There's something a little sad (and prophetic) as Britain's only trade magazine for journalists, Press Gazette, thinks about going internet-only, then settles for monthly print life with digital service in between. Death by a thousand shifts and changes of ownership? Perhaps. A baleful reward for being too investigative, critical and generally independent? Perhaps again: some fine, solid reporters did their stuff. But the fact is that - awards sponsorship apart - the Gazette could never quite speak for national and regional journalists equally authoritatively, especially as the career ties that bound them together weakened. Print journalism is at least three trades if you throw in magazines; so too many voices equalled too little job advertising. Is there internet salvation from such a plight? Perhaps: America supports a bevy of lively sites. But they began as electronic wheezes; they were original notions, not last rites.</p> <h2>Terry's lost virtues embodied</h2> <p>Terry Wogan grows somewhat crabbier as he turns 70. He thinks the BBC isn't what it was and that the Eurovision song contest is back-scratching politics. (Has he only just noticed?) He says 'old-fashioned thoroughness and commitment have disappeared' from the corridors of Broadcasting House and TV Centre. As he was blasting off to Radio Times, by chance one of the BBC's great names, Bill Cotton, died at 80. The obituaries and tributes came with a special warmth. Michael Grade loved him; Will Wyatt loved him. He was a 'fund of common sense' said the Times. He had old-fashioned commitment in abundance - and a genius grasp of public taste. He sounds oddly like a management clone of Wogan.</p> <h2>Editor's note: the Caucasus has become the front line</h2> <p>When the focus of news shifts mightily, other shifts follow: which means that South Ossetia and Abkhazia go to the top of most foreign editors' in-trays. OK, so even in the midst of Olympics glitz, the reaction to the Georgian crisis seemed reasonably fleet. The Telegraph's Moscow man was on a plane south before you could say Saakashvili. Synchronised swimming or not, the BBC still had reserve legions to deploy. Luke Harding, holiday interrupted, filed vivid copy for the Guardian. Tony Halpin beavered bravely for the Times</p> <p>But reacting when war breaks out isn't quite the same as consistent coverage: and there the in-tray pulsates. Caucasus background coverage over the first eight months of the year has been pretty decent on examination: 17 chunky pieces in the Telegraph; 19 in the Times. But almost all of it was written from afar, from the Moscow or the London office. Can editors risk such long-distance reporting any longer?</p> <p>The first eight years of the 21st century have seen significant shifts already: more staff in the US (because of its internet readership), fewer in Europe (the Indy has even dropped Brussels), and Moscow itself slipping from front-rank posting status. Yet does that make sense any longer? Putin and Medvedev are making huge waves. Watch the Ukraine jump to crisis stations next. And this can't be a Russian story, told just from the Russian side. You'll need correspondents on the ground in the Caucasus and beyond.</p> <p>Where do they come from? Maybe from Obama territory once the November vote is over. Maybe from letting the synchronised swimmers go hang. The point is that our world has a new fault line to fret over, and the question isn't whether, but how, to patrol it best.</p> <h2>Farewell, John MacDougall</h2> <p>He was a doughty, enlightened council leader, a champion of nursery education and free transport for the elderly. He found jobs for his people when there were none. He was a popular, dogged public servant for three decades. And then? The Telegraph tells the only story anyone seems interested in: 'Brown facing new byelection after MP dies'. </p> <p>Farewell, John MacDougall. Politics (and its reporting) is a cruel, forgetful game.</p>",
  "<p>When David Cameron's bicycle was stolen in London's Notting Hill last month, Matthew Parris noted that the media portrayed him sympathetically: an ordinary shopper who had suffered a plight that you or I might share. 'If Gordon Brown's bike had been nicked in identical circumstances,' Parris added, 'we would have dubbed him a prat for chaining it to a stub from which it could be easily lifted, and described the incident as yet another stumble for a hapless politician who seems incapable even of taking his bike down to the shops.'</p> <p>A year ago, Brown was an invincible leader poised to crush all-comers under his fist. Today, he is a dead man walking. Has his ability really suffered so much in 12 months or have external forces beyond his control shaped a deadly narrative? And how much of that is down to pure chance?</p> <p>The subtitle of Leonard Mlodinow's book goes so far as to suggest that randomness 'rules' our everyday lives. Study flat out at school and you'll still never match the career of the guy whose dad plays golf with the boss. Search for the perfect match on dating websites and you'll meet your future spouse at the station because the train was late one day. </p> <p>This is 'the Drunkard's Walk', a mathematical term that describes random motion, such as the paths taken by molecules as they move though space, incessantly bumping or being bumped by their sister molecules. So it is with our lives, buffeted by chance meetings and accidental encounters, trying to chart a steady course until another gust of fate sends us staggering. We don't have to blame the gods any more, Mlodinow tells us. We don't have to blame ourselves. We can blame the dice.</p> <p>Perhaps Mlodinow, a physicist and former Hollywood TV writer, hopes that The Drunkard's Walk will follow a recent trend for books with buzz-word titles: The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell, Chris Anderson's The Long Tail and, most recently, Nudge by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein. But although he moves nimbly through probability theory and the spinning of statistics, there are too many long-winded paragraphs where it's easy to see what's coming. There are cultural references, such as an attempted joke about the looks of Tom Cruise and Danny DeVito, which feel terribly dated in 2008.</p> <p>Still, Mlodinow's telling central premise is that our desire for control leaves us in denial about how important randomness is. Intuitively, we prefer to construct a linear narrative that makes events seem inevitable. Pearl Harbour and 9/11 were easy causal patterns to trace with hindsight, but rather less so beforehand. Individual success, too, is a lottery: JK Rowling's first Harry Potter manuscript was rejected by several publishers, Bruce Willis was a jobbing actor until he got a lucky break and even Bill Gates would have been 'just another software entrepreneur' but for a series of accidents. For every Rowling, Willis or Gates, how many equally talented people quit too soon because their coin hasn't yet come up heads? Perseverance, it seems, is all.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Mlodinow fails to develop this in what should have been his most provocative chapter. If the connection between actions and results is not as direct as we like to believe, what does that mean politically for the class system, social mobility and the self-justification of society's elite? Sixties social psychologist Melvin Lerner, realising that 'few people would engage in extended activity if they believed that there were a random connection between what they did and the rewards they received', concluded that 'for the sake of their own sanity' people overestimate the degree to which ability can be inferred from success.</p> <p>Would people in the US still fervently believe in the American Dream if they understood that hard work alone may not be enough? Such questions are better explored in the plays of Arthur Miller, notably Death of a Salesman and The Man Who Had All the Luck.</p>",
  "<p>Mining giant BHP Billiton will tomorrow report record results on the back of the commodities boom. Analysts are predicting profits of $16bn (\u00a38.5bn), up a fifth on the previous year. </p> <p>The Australian-based miner will also update analysts on its attempts to seal one of the largest hostile takeovers in history by buying rival Rio Tinto. </p> <p>BHP, led by chief executive Marius Kloppers, has been discussing its proposal with competition authorities since tabling the bid last February. The European Commission will rule at the end of the year whether the deal can go ahead.

China is the largest steel-producing country, and so is heavily dependent on ore imports.</p> <p>In a bid to derail the merger - or at least influence the outcome - state-owned aluminium company Chinalco made a dramatic raid to buy a 10 per cent stake in Rio Tinto days before BHP submitted its formal offer.</p> <p>China is preparing framework legislation for its first competition law.

  "<p>Not content with offending huge swaths of northern England, an academic who caused uproar by saying the regeneration of cities such as Liverpool and Sunderland had failed, has delivered a second outspoken assault - this time on London.</p> <p>Dr Oliver Marc Hartwich, the German-born chief economist at David Cameron's favourite think-tank, Policy Exchange, is set to embark on a new career in Australia in October. In a hitherto unpublished article, he has expressed his frustration at having to endure the past four years down south in the capital of what he condemns as 'rip-off Britain'.</p> <p>Ahead of his move to a think-tank in Sydney, Hartwich complains about the cost of everything from London cinema tickets to trips on the Heathrow Express and shelves in Ikea, which he notes are 20 to 30 per cent more expensive than in Germany. In a piece published in full on The Observer website, Hartwich writes: 'Britain is one of the most expensive countries on the planet and London its rip-off capital.</p> <p>'Filling your car, eating out, staying at a hotel or just doing the weekly shopping are all more costly undertakings than in other industrialised countries around the globe - even without taking house prices into account.'</p> <p>All this would have been 'bearable', he says, if only the extra costs had bought a quality of life demonstrably better than that in other great cities such as Berlin and Sydney. 'Yet, having thought about it for a long time while my tube train was stuck in a tunnel on Thursday morning, I do not believe this is the case. If anything life in London is worse than it is in other big international cities,' he says.</p> <p>He adds: 'If the UK continues to be one of the most expensive addresses in the world while it fails to provide the best infrastructure and public services, it should not be surprised if it loses its most qualified people and fails to attract foreign professionals.'</p> <p>Hartwich was one of three academics behind the Policy Exchange report, 'Cities Unlimited' - published last week - which concluded that attempts to regenerate many northern cities had failed.</p> <p>Disastrously for the Tories, its publication coincided with a trip by Cameron to the north to rustle up support, providing a gift to Labour's top northerners such as John Prescott, who said that it was typical 'insulting' nonsense from Tories who did not care about anyone north of Watford. Local papers across the north tore into the 'Tory think-tank' and raised questions about Cameron's friends down in London.</p> <p>Places such as Sunderland and Hull, the report argued, had been well positioned at the time of the Industrial Revolution but were now in the wrong place at the wrong time, and had lost their 'raison d'etre'.</p> <p>The episode exposed the dangers for political parties of allying themselves to politically sympathetic but independent think-tanks, staffed by restless young intellectuals keen to make a name for themselves.</p> <p>As Tories despaired and called for Policy Exchange to be reined in or disowned, Cameron launched a stinging attack on Hartwich in an attempt to limit the damage. 'I gather he is off to Australia. The sooner he gets on the ship the better,' the Tory leader said.</p> <p>Hartwich was unrepentant last night, insisting that the media had trivialised and misrepresented the report, which called for local authorities to be given complete control over regeneration policy as a way to find more imaginative solutions. He said: 'People should stop pretending there are miracle solutions for places like Liverpool. They could shrink a bit and be better for it.'</p> <p>He said he was looking forward to moving to a job with Australia's biggest think-tank, the Centre for Independent Studies, in the autumn, where he hopes to influence policy and live a cheaper, more comfortable life. 'Quality of life and cost of living considerations were part of the reason for going, certainly.'</p> <p>His parting shot to the British will be a book to be published in Germany in 2009, entitled England - Nachruf auf ein gro\u00dfartiges Land ('England: obituary for a great country').</p>",
  "<p>'Trust to your feet, Jossy,' yells Guido, as I scrabble for a foothold with my crampons in the hard-packed ice below me. I can't even feel my feet. I can't look down or sideways. I am clinging, frozen, to a near-vertical wall of rutted, windblown ice at 3,000m, in a 40mph wind, on the side of a volcano in Chile. My backpack, with my skis strapped to it, feels like it's pulling me backwards off the mountain. Finally we reach the summit, and peer over the icy lip of the crater, from which sulphurous smoke is billowing. I am choked up and it's not just the smoke. We have just conquered our first volcano, the magnificent Llaima, all 3,125m of it.</p> <p>For a diehard skier, it's an age-old problem: when the snows melt in Europe and North America, where do you go to get your skiing kicks? I'd often wondered about heading south, to Chile, but the resorts there, such as Valle Nevado and Portillo, didn't seem to offer much more than I could find summer-skiing on the glacier in the French resort of Tignes. Then, on a winter ski trip, I bumped into Phil Smith, owner of tour group Snoworks, who told me about the skiing and climbing trip he runs to Chile. The 15-day tour would involve climbing up and skiing down nine of the volcanoes in Chile's southern Lakes District. Something different, something challenging - it sounded too good to miss.</p> <p>So, several months later, I found myself in the town of Temuco, capital of the Araucan\u00eda region, with Phil and four other experienced skiers - all of them men. A local company, Amity Tours, was to look after us for our two weeks: Cristi\u00e0n the owner, Guido our guide, and Milton the driver, who would ferry us and our gear between the hotels and volcanoes, each of which lay roughly three hours' drive apart. It soon became clear that skiing down the volcanoes would be the - relatively - easy part. Ascending them was where the real challenge lay; a mix of ski lifts, climbing, walking and 'skinning' - walking uphill on skis. </p> <p>The first volcano was Antuco, in the Laguna del Laja National Park. It was a far cry from Val d'Is\u00e8re's groomed slopes and armies of piste bashers, but that was exactly what we'd come for. Chile has some of the world's best off-piste skiing, with untracked snowfields as far as the eye can see. The only problem can be the weather: the rain came down so heavily on Antuco that we had to cut the day short and head off to Corralco mountain lodge in the Malalcahuello National Reserve, from where we would attempt the 2,865m Lonquimay volcano. When we arrived the wind had whipped up and Guido told us we wouldn't be able to begin the climb until midday. Frustrating, but it gave us the chance to appreciate the setting: the dramatic sight of Lonquimay, its gleaming white flanks adorned with the extraordinary araucaria (monkey puzzle) trees that are native to the region. Breathtaking.</p> <p>As was the climb, when it finally began. The hotel's tank-like Ecotrack vehicle took us as far as it could - to the bottom of the first chairlift, which was buried in snow. Chile had had record snowfalls, which meant most of the lifts weren't running. This was my first real introduction to skinning; we attached 'skins' to the underside of our skis, synthetic strips whose fibres all go in one direction so the skis will slide forward but not back, and began the hike upwards. It was incredibly tough: my new boots dug into my shins with every step, and I was sweating buckets. Phil told us that we needed to get into a 'plod mentality', but I didn't feel I could realistically go any slower. We climbed for two hours and were still nowhere near the summit. My thoughts were alternating between 'why am I doing this?' and 'God, it's so beautiful up here'. The scenery is incredible - great jagged snowy peaks against a deep blue sky. And even though, by the end of the climb, my legs had turned to jelly, the ski down made it all worth it. The high altitude meant the snow conditions were perfect - soft and powdery over a firm base. Not being an experienced off-piste skier, I got the chance to appreciate the way the sunlight sparkled through the araucaria trees - as I ended up on my back in the snow several times during the descent.</p> <p>Fortunately, although this was an adventure holiday, we were hardly roughing it. Accommodation ranged from simple but comfortable to the seriously luxurious - and all of it came with warm, Chilean hospitality. At the lakeshore Marina del Puy hotel, in Huilo Huilo Biological Reserve, we were royally wined, dined and entertained by a troupe of local dancers brought in specially to welcome us, while at Los Pioneros lodge we each returned from dinner to find a crackling fire had been lit in the small wood-burning stoves in our rooms.</p> <p>Each day brought new adventures. 'This is puma country,' Cristi\u00e0n told us cheerily as we prepared for the climb up Sollipulli in Villarrica National Reserve. 'Never run away. They attack from behind.' Although thrilled to think we might see a puma, I was a little nervous on that 2,282m climb. It was fairly straightforward, but I had developed painful blisters - due in no small part, according to Guido, to my poor sock choice. This time it was the descent that proved trickier: I felt a little like Bridget Jones as I careered out of control through heavy wet snow. Once we were at the bottom, Guido collected water from a mountain stream. 'It tastes like the best wine when you've been climbing,' he said. Oddly, he was right.</p> <p>At El Mocho, in Huilo Huilo, we were glad to get towed up behind a Snowcat almost to the top of the 2,422m peak. The run down was through fabulous powder, and it was all going rather well, I thought, until I hit a massive rut left by the Snowcat tracks. By this time I had started to get the hang of skinning and even though the next peak, Casablanca, was a straight skin all the way up to 1,990m, we made it up and down by lunchtime. I was increasingly determined to make it up Osorno, our last climb - at 2,652m not the highest, but it's near-vertical ice-capped summit made it by far the toughest.</p> <p>'Look at me, smile, and let go of the rope,' yelled Guido, as I hung beneath the icy white summit of Volcano Osorno. I took a deep breath, took my hands off the rope and dug in my crampons. From somewhere below, Cristi\u00e0n was directing me, 'left a bit, no...left, LEFT', as I bounced in and out of huge ice troughs. Although my legs were like lead after the six-and-a-half-hour climb, the ski down - against the electric-pink glow of the sunset - was truly euphoric. I had made it to the top of Osorno, and I arrived at the bottom grinning from ear to ear, to a round of applause from the other guys. My joy was only slightly dampened by the fact they had already drunk all the beer.</p> <p>It was a spectacular end to an unforgettable fortnight. For experienced ski tourers, this would be the trip of a lifetime. For me, a novice, it was an incredible personal achievement. I had learnt to use skins, crampons and ice axes, and how to abseil. I almost mastered kick-turns, and I developed a taste for cake - for breakfast. 'I am NEVER doing this again,' I had shouted at Guido, when we were half-way up Llaima with aching limbs and sore feet. 'I'll see you at the top of Osorno, Jossy,' came his reply. At that moment I was convinced I wouldn't even try that ascent. But I did it. And now I want to do it all over again. Only this time with much better socks.</p> <h2>The essentials</h2> <p>Jossy Smalley travelled to Chile with Snoworks and Amity Tours (<a href=\"http://www.snoworks.co.uk\">snoworks.co.uk</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amitytours.cl\">amitytours.cl</a>). For 2008, the two-week itinerary has been modified to include seven, rather than nine, volcanoes: Lonquimay, Sollipulli, Villarrica, Mocho-Choshuenco, Casablanca, Osorno, and one other peak depending on weather conditions.

  "<p>BAA, it seems, is the company everyone loves to hate. Most passengers having to fight their way through the chaos at its airports, such as Heathrow, are not big fans. Neither are the airlines, some of whom have taken legal action against the airports operator. The Spanish-owned group operates a monopoly, the airlines say, resulting in expensive, overcrowded and poorly run airports, which are also too small. But when BAA does try to expand - trying to build new runways at Heathrow and Stansted - it gets it in the neck from environmentalists. </p> <p>BAA is also in the sights of the Competition Commission. Some 91 per of all flights in the south east take off from airports owned by BAA. Iata, the international airline body, says no other airports owner exerts such control over a market, particularly given that Britain is an island and so relies more than some other countries on air travel. </p> <p>This week, the commission is expected to recommend that BAA be forced to sell Heathrow, Stansted or Gatwick, most likely the latter. By effectively breaking up BAA and dividing Britain's largest airports among different owners, the commission hopes that they will compete against each other and so provide a better service to passengers and airlines. </p> <p>But passengers hoping that a sale of Gatwick could solve the UK airports mess should think again. Peter Morris, chief economist of consultancy Ascend, says: 'It does not make sense to sell Gatwick and hope some magic takes place so that the airports work properly.' </p> <p>So how can Britain's airports be fixed? One of the few issues that BAA, the airlines and the commission are agreed on is that the lack of airport capacity in the south east makes competition difficult. Because there is so much demand for flights in the region, the airports there will be fully used whether they are well-run or not. So a new owner of Gatwick would not have to try any harder than BAA to attract airlines and passengers. Moreover, even if airlines did want to move to a better-run Gatwick, there wouldn't be any space for them. </p> <p>But the commission and airlines point the finger at BAA for causing the shortage of capacity in the first place - a charge hotly contested by the airports group. They accuse it of deliberately slowing the expansion of their airports in the south east in order to reinforce its monopoly. BAA has traditionally only tackled one major project at a time. According to the commission, it has even offered not to expand - for example telling the planning inspector for Terminal 5 that it would commit to not building a third runway at Heathrow. </p> <p>In 1979, in return for getting the go-ahead to build the north terminal at Gatwick, BAA also promised West Sussex county council not to build a second runway before 2019, which seems an excessively long-term commitment. </p> <p>It's certainly fair to say that over the last 20 years, BAA has been slow to expand, which the company blames on planning restrictions and government dithering; the commission, however, argues that BAA has actively deferred decisions on expansion to government in the knowledge that they would be delayed. BAA also counters that it is now trying to enlarge both Heathrow and Stansted; but this is long overdue. </p> <p>Whether wittingly or not, BAA is the beneficiary of an underdeveloped and run-down airports system in the south east. Just selling Gatwick, in the short term, would have little impact. </p> <p>The commission is also examining how BAA is regulated, as is the government. The regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority - which, like BAA, is vilified by most airlines - itself acknowledges that the current regime needs to change. Its main role is to set the landing charges levied by airports on airlines every five years, but it has little flexibility significantly to reward - or penalise - BAA for its performance in the interim period. </p> <p>As well as having to fork out a whopping increase of more than 20 per cent a quarter in landing fees this year, airlines are also justifiably upset that the fees go toward facilities which, in some cases, they do not benefit from - for example T5, which is to be used exclusively by British Airways. In the future, airlines want the regulator to exert more influence over BAA's spending, as well as introducing performance criteria that it must meet. </p> <p>Ironically, if the sale of Gatwick and a new regulatory regime do make airports more competitive, airlines are worried that regulation could weaken. Currently, only Manchester, Gatwick, Heathrow and Stansted are subject to price controls set by the CAA, while the majority of the UK's airports are not regulated. Some airlines worry that if Gatwick were sold, it could also be exempt, which could result in higher fees. </p> <p>One other consequence of a sale of Gatwick is that the construction of a second runway would become more likely. In the government's 2003 White Paper on aviation, which set out its preferred options for airport expansion, new runways at Heathrow and Stansted were recommended before expansion at Gatwick. But the commission has criticised the way development has been prioritised because it discriminates against airports lower down in the list of recommendations. A new owner would also be more likely than BAA to press ahead with plans to build a new runway.</p> <p>There is no quick fix to the problems of airports in the south east. Heathrow is in the wrong place: being west of London means most flight paths are over the capital, making expansion difficult. Stansted, Gatwick, City and Luton airports are too spread out to provide any connectivity. </p> <p>As Morris from Ascend says: 'In the south east, we have managed to lump ourselves with one of the most masochistic airport systems in the world.'</p>",
  "<p>Part of Russia's justification for wresting control of South Ossetia from Georgia is that many of the region's residents hold Russian passports. The Kremlin was therefore - so it claims - protecting its citizens from Georgian aggression.</p> <p>That line sends ripples of alarm throughout the former Soviet Union, where many states that became independent in 1991 took sizable Russian populations with them. Ukraine, Latvia, Estonia, Moldova and Kazakhstan, for example, have much to fear if the Kremlin sees their hosting of a Russian diaspora as a licence to ignore their borders.</p> <p>The problem is not just one of nationality. Russianness is an elastic concept, covering millions who speak Russian as their first language but who, in the Soviet era, were classified as Belarussians, Ukrainians, Jews or Ossetians. To make matters worse, many of the areas where Russians or Russian-speakers predominate are the subject of territorial disputes that pre-date even the USSR.</p> <p>Officially, 17.3 per cent of people living in Ukraine are ethnic Russians (around 8 million people). But more have Russian as a first language and they are concentrated in the east of the country, which nationalists in Moscow argue is culturally indivisible from the old Slavic motherland. Ukrainian nationalists vehemently disagree. The same goes for Belarus (official Russian population: 11.4 per cent, around 1 million people).</p> <p>But the greatest tensions are in two of the Baltic States: Latvia (29.6 per cent Russian) and Estonia (25.6 per cent Russian). Although they formed part of the Russian empire in the 19th century, the Balts broke away when the Soviet Union was formed and were only forcibly reassimilated during the Second World War. Stalin then waged a brutal demographic war, shipping ethnic Latvians and Estonians to Siberia, and settling Russians in their place.</p> <p>When they regained independence, Latvia and Estonia didn't give citizenship to many of their resident Russians, whom they saw as the remnants of an occupying force. Moscow continues to agitate on behalf of them, which the Balts see as flagrant imperialism. Last year rioting broke out in Tallinn between Estonians and Russians over a decision to take down a Soviet-era war memorial.</p> <p>Where the allegiance of the millions of Russians spread throughout the former USSR lies isn't known. But it is clear that the Kremlin sees itself as their rightful protector. Or rather, it sees strategic advantage in laying claim to that status. </p>",
  "<p>This brave venture, presenting Dante's Inferno in 60 minutes, works amazingly well. Virgil (Alex Jennings) guides Dante (Corin Redgrave) through the Circles of Hell and finally to Heavenly Light. The eerie background sounds and cacophony of anguished cries and lamentation are truly haunting as Dante does the Grand Tour of sinners' punishments - flung into boiling tar by the Devil, turned into bleeding trees, locked in ice, wrapped in snakes or consumed by unrelievable itching. The Bosch-like cameos of suffering are so visual, the language so vivid, the sounds so atmospheric that I was as relieved as Dante to see that Heavenly Light.</p>",
  "<p>In the old days - more accurately, a few years ago - students had to rely on flashing their NUS card at every retailer they could find or cutting out money-off coupons from magazines and newspapers to save money. But the internet has revolutionised the scope for students to save a few quid. Students are, usually out of necessity, an admirably tight lot who will stop at nothing to save pennies. So, in an effort to help them save a little more, Cash has come up with 10 types of website to help out. </p> <h2>1. Online auctions</h2> <p>It's impossible to mention money-saving websites without a nod to the original and still much-loved (by some) - <a href=\"http://www.eBay.co.uk\">eBay</a>. Since its launch in 1999 it has grown to be the UK's number one e-commerce site with 14 million items for sale at any one time. It's ideal for students who are disciplined with their spending as it can throw up some bargains on anything from clothes to furniture. But with the average person spending one hour 42 minutes on the site per visit, it's all too easy to waste time buying what you don't actually need.</p> <p><strong>Money-saving rating: 5/10</strong></p> <h2>2. Secondhand goods</h2> <p>Buying books can end up as one of your biggest expenses at university, which is why it makes sense to get secondhand versions. The university library will be good for some of these but online book giant Amazon has a 'used and new' service that allows you to buy second-hand from other Amazon customers. At the moment, for example, the site has a new Collins Concise English Dictionary discounted from \u00a320 to \u00a313, or you can buy a copy on the site from Amazon's returned-and-damaged-goods offshoot, Warehouse Deals, for \u00a39.50. Students (and anyone else) can also sell back books on the site.</p> <p>The classified-advertising giant <a href=\"http://www.Gumtree.co.uk\">Gumtree.co.uk</a> is also a decent place for cheap secondhand goods. It includes a section where you can swap items: last week one user was prepared - perhaps rather optimistically - to exchange his iPhone for a Macbook laptop, for example. </p> <p><strong>Money-saving rating: 9/10</strong></p> <h2>3. Promotion/voucher sites</h2> <p>A cornucopia of websites has sprung up over the past few months, effectively acting as online directories listing a range of discount vouchers and special offers from companies around the UK. These include student-specific sites such as <a href=\"http://www.Studentbeans.com\">Studentbeans.com</a>, which has offers such as buy-one-get-one-free at Gourmet Burger Kitchen and a 10 per cent discount at Glasses Direct. <a href=\"http://www.Myvouchercodes.co.uk\">Myvouchercodes.co.uk</a> is another site that is easier to navigate and appears at first search to have better offers than Studentbeans, including free delivery from Asda when spending \u00a350 on grocery shopping and a 10 per cent discount from eBay.</p> <p><strong>Money-saving rating: 6/10</strong></p> <h2>4. Cashback sites</h2> <p>A twist on the voucher/discount sites are cashback websites, which link up with retailers to give you money back when you shop. The amount of cash you earn can vary and may be a percentage of your total purchase or a flat fee. Sites to check out include <a href=\"http://www.Internetcashback.co.uk\">Internetcashback.co.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.Quidco.com\">Quidco.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.Greasypalm.co.uk\">Greasypalm.co.uk</a>.</p> <p><strong>Money-saving rating: 4/10</strong></p> <h2>5. Travel home</h2> <p>If campus food is really as bad as everyone says, you might be heading home for mum's cooking more often than you had thought. Train travel in the UK is notoriously expensive, but it is usually cheaper to book directly through a train company's own website rather than through <a href=\"http://www.Thetrainline.com\">Thetrainline.com</a>, which charges booking and card fees. An alternative to Thetrainline.com is <a href=\"http://www.Raileasy.co.uk\">Raileasy.co.uk</a>, which can throw up cheaper tickets; if you can plan ahead and book 12 weeks in advance (for going home for the end of term, say) you'll bag the cheapest tickets the day they go on sale. A cheaper option still is to travel by bus. <a href=\"http://www.Megabus.com\">Megabus.com</a> offers tickets from as little as \u00a31 each way. </p> <p><strong>Money-saving rating: 5/10</strong></p> <h2>6. Cut-price food bills</h2> <p>Supermarket price comparison website <a href=\"http://www.Mysupermarket.com\">Mysupermarket.com</a> claims to cut food bills by 20 per cent. It works by comparing every product on your shopping list across Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Ocado (Waitrose) in order to find the lowest price and the best offers. If it finds a similar product at a better price, it will suggest you swap it and you can compare the whole cost of your trolley at the end before you decide where to check out. The site is free to use, though you may pay a delivery charge from the supermarket of your choice. </p> <p><strong>Money-saving rating: 8/10</strong></p> <h2>7. Financial products</h2> <p>Insurance, bank accounts, savings accounts, mobile phones, broadband... compare the cost of these and other financial products, utilities and telecoms at a whole plethora of price comparison websites including the Compare and Buy section at - among others - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money\">www.theguardian.com/money</a>, or at <a href=\"http://www.Gocompare.com\">Gocompare.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.Moneysupermarket.com\">Moneysupermarket.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.Uswitch.com\">Uswitch.com</a>. </p> <p><strong>Money-saving rating: 9/10</strong></p> <h2>8. Cut-price fashion</h2> <p>Fed up with your wardrobe? Bought one Che Guevara T-shirt too many? Why not swap clothes, shoes or bags with someone? Websites such as <a href=\"http://www.Whatsmineisyours.com\">Whatsmineisyours.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.Bigwardrobe.com\">Bigwardrobe.com</a> provide an online marketplace to allow you to do this. Whatsmineisyours also has an eBay-like facility that allows users to buy and sell clothes. The sites are aimed at both sexes, though Bigwardrobe has far more male users than Whatsmineisyours. For final-year students looking for something special for a graduation ball, <a href=\"http://www.Fashionhire.com\">Fashionhire.com</a> allows you to rent designer bags for a month at a time. </p> <p><strong>Money-saving rating: 3/10</strong></p> <h2>9. Cheap phone calls</h2> <p>Gone are the days when students had to queue up to use public phones in campus halls. Most students now have mobiles and many have an internet connection in their room. Advice on choosing the cheapest mobile phone tariffs is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/17/studentfinance.householdbills\">here</a>, but an alternative way to save money is by using Voice Over Internet Protocol (Voip) or, in layman's terms, phone calls over the net. There are lots of providers but amongst the biggest are Skype and Vonage. You'll need a headset attached to your computer; then, for a monthly fee from as little as \u00a31.95, you get free calls to UK landlines and, depending on the fee, free calls to other countries. Mobile phone network 3 offers Voip on the move via a 'Skypephone', which its pay-monthly customers can get free. </p> <p><strong>Money-saving rating: 7/10</strong></p> <h2>10. Free stuff</h2> <p>Website <a href=\"http://www.Freebiesbank.co.uk\">Freebiesbank.co.uk</a> is a directory of - and link to - free stuff available on the net. A lot of it is tat, but among the top 10 most popular free products are Simple skincare samples, jelly beans, shaving oil, Lancashire tea, lip gloss and shampoo. Another website offering freebies is the UK free recycling network Freecycle. The idea is that, in an effort to keep unnecessary waste out of landfills, members give and get items for free.

  "<p>Not so very long ago, a woman was lying in bed with her husband and talking. Somehow she didn't notice that he was transcribing her monologue; he recognised the tragicomic potential of her stream of anxious thoughts. When he handed over his notebook, she snorted with laughter, but also felt chastened. Seeing her thoughts written down in black and white gave her a jolt. What kind of loon was she?</p> <p>She was me, and I still have the transcript. </p> <p>My worries that evening covered the following topics: my hair (frizzy, split ends, more grey showing), whether the front door was locked, my eyes (possibility of an eye infection, which could preclude wearing contact lenses, which is to say: disaster), having flat feet (no good with flip-flops, so summer is effectively useless to me), was the front door really locked, the possibility of falling downstairs, my friend Sophie (why she hadn't returned my phone calls). Oh, and are you positive you locked the front door, or should I check?</p> <p>Worrying is something I've always excelled at. In this subject, I'm top of the class, straight As. But it's near impossible for me to get my friends to take my angst seriously. 'Your worries are frankly too ludicrous,' said my friend Eleanor when I called her to talk about this article. </p> <p>It's true. I accept many of my concerns seem unserious. And in public I make light of them, happily casting myself as a kind of female Woody Allen. But when I'm at home those ridiculous concerns can take over. </p> <p>I jump from one to the next without allowing myself a moment's rest. 'As soon as you finish one worry,' says my husband, 'which you usually insist is the worst you've ever had, you immediately start on another.' </p> <p>I'm not a flamboyant worrier; I don't have panic attacks, I don't wail or hyperventilate. Instead, I retreat into my own brain often for hours at a time, stuck either in the past, wishing that something that has happened hadn't (or vice versa), or in the future, overwhelmed by some monstrous circumstance that may never come to be. To my husband, this feels like I'm 'mentally absent'. It's exhausting living inside my head sometimes. It's a hideous waste of time and extremely annoying for those around me. </p> <p>In my last job, on a glossy magazine, the beauty editor encouraged me to have Botox not because I was looking older (though, now I think of it, I worry that this may have been what she was hinting at), but because I looked so anxious all the time. 'I think it'll really change the way people respond to you,' she said brightly. </p> <p>Did people truly think I looked worried? Now I was really worried. But I declined the Botox, because it would have done nothing to address the underlying problem. </p> <p>Anxiety is a bigger problem than this navel-gazing might suggest. Across a spectrum that includes panic attacks, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress, phobias and the catch-all, generalised anxiety disorder - anxiety disorder has become the most prevalent mental health problem in the world, according to a World Mental Health Survey of 18 countries.</p> <p>And it's about to get worse. We are entering a new age of anxiety. As the economic situation worsens, so fretting in the general population rises. In the past year, oil prices have risen by 50 per cent, basic foods such as rice have soared by as much as 70 per cent and house prices are plummeting at a faster rate than we've seen in a long time. Those in the know are starting to whisper that we're heading for the mother of all recessions.</p> <p>Most people will take little comfort in the fact that the man in charge of all this, Prime Minister Gordon Brown, bites his fingernails. </p> <p>Merryn Somerset Webb, editor of MoneyWeek, has noticed clear signs of anxiety among her readers. 'People are anxious, and they are right to be. They're worrying about investments and pensions, the effect of inflation on their future, about which banks are safe and which might go bust. We have had letters from people who have lost a lot of money on the property market. People under 40 are not used to losing jobs or being made redundant. We are not used to property prices falling or not having what we want. As adults we haven't suffered hardship. I do think a lot of people are in for a big shock.' </p> <p>Economists tell us that what happens in the US will happen to us nine months later. Well, in June it emerged that the American middle classes are losing their homes and finding themselves obliged to live instead in their cars, in specially designated parking lots.</p> <p>City health clinics have reported a huge rise in calls from professionals facing redundancy. A helpline used by London's major banks and financial firms received 3,500 calls in June from people with anxiety and depression - a 10 per cent rise on last year. Project director James Slater says: 'People are worried about redundancies and a potential recession, which adds to people's anxiety, can tip them over the edge.'</p> <p>Don Serratt, a former merchant banker and founder of the Life Works community rehab clinic, has seen a 20 per cent rise since last November in admissions related to economic anxiety. 'We are getting more and more calls from people not just in the City but professionals from all over. Things are bad right now.'</p> <p>Dr Richard Bowskill, consultant psychiatrist at the Priory, is more specific: 'For a while, we have seen people worrying about mortgages and the cost of living. But now we have started to see people worrying about job security. That has a knock-on effect. It leads to people pushing themselves at work. I saw someone this morning who said they couldn't take any more time off work because they felt under scrutiny.</p> <p>'The mind is just another part of the body,' Bowskill explains. 'It's an organ that normally functions well but, if put under too much strain, it starts not functioning properly. The physical symptoms are things like palpitations, stomach churning and sleep disturbance.'</p> <p>Fretting and hand-wringing represent a considerable drain on our time and energy. 'People who worry a lot are generally less effective than those who don't; they get less work done and are often less happy,' says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University. In experimental tasks, worriers are slower to respond than non-worriers, presumably because worrying burns off mental energy that would be more effectively applied elsewhere. 'Worry, it has been said, is often like a rocking chair: it gives you something to do, but it doesn't necessarily get you anywhere. Evolution may have given us the opportunity to worry, but that doesn't mean we should take the bait.'</p> <p>Indeed, constant worry has a clear and scientifically proven link to ill health. Chronic worriers, for example, are more likely than others to suffer from heart conditions. The connection between worry and poor health can also take a less predictable form. Two years ago, I convinced myself I had an eye infection. So I took myself to Moorfields Eye Hospital for checks. It turned out that my eye was perfectly healthy, but sitting in the casualty department among genuine patients, their eyes weeping pus, I picked up an extremely serious viral conjunctivitis that lasted three months and threatened to compromise my sight forever. The lesson: hypochondria really gave me something to worry about. </p> <p>But it seems I've not got it as bad as many others. In the course of researching this story, I bought (and immediately hid inside my bag) a book called Overcoming Anxiety for Dummies. My husband flicked through it before me, and announced with some satisfaction that I didn't seem to have such a bad case after all. For instance I have never felt, like one poor unfortunate in the book, that I was actually going to die during a panic attack.</p> <p>Anxiety, says psychologist Oliver James, is worrying about things you can't do anything about, or which don't matter. It's not the same as fear: fear sharpens the senses, anxiety paralyses them. 'The key thing,' James tells me, 'is that anxiety is irrational. It's a loss of priority - a lost sense of what is <br>important and what isn't.' </p> <p>In my own case, though I am concerned about the environment and the ongoing economic downturn, these are not the things that get me in a funk. I am much less likely to wake in the night in a panic about rising sea levels, or rising fuel bills, than about having a bad haircut. </p> <p>Another way to look at anxiety is as a chemically induced response to threat: the hormone cortisol is secreted, in turn leading to an excess of adrenaline. You go into the fight or the flight mode. 'If your cortisol levels are permanently jammed on high,' explains James, 'you are going to feel permanently under threat. You become indiscriminate about what constitutes a threat. You go to the kitchen to make a cup of tea and worry about running out of tea bags. You become irritable, you swear, you burst into tears. You have very extreme reactions relative to the significance.'</p> <p>The Michelin-starred chef Tom Aikens knows a bit about this. He's well known for an alleged incident with a palette knife that got him fired from his first restaurant. In recent years, he says, he has calmed down a lot thanks to therapy and regular exercise, but at the time - a decade ago - he was 'wound up, stressed', and liable to get upset about silly things. 'I used to bottle everything up and then explode, go off on one. It was always about the little details, because it's the little details that make food special. I would be so stupid. I would be so stressed by an overcooked piece of meat. What's the point? Just put another one on.'</p> <p>According to James, a person's cortisol levels are pretty much set in the first six years of life. If he's right, I can't imagine what might have set my own levels high. I did, years ago, visit a Freudian therapist who gave me a box of hankies and encouraged me to churn up what seemed even to me to be rather petty resentments from the distant past. Rightly or wrongly, I found this approach unhelpful and didn't return. Much more helpful were sessions, a few years later, with a cognitive therapist - who tried to address the way I look at the world and respond to events - though, as must already be clear, she didn't eliminate my problems over the long term.</p> <p>Rather than look back, what matters is whether I am likely to pass on my worrying tendencies to my daughter, now four years old. Although sunny, confident and happy, she has already started registering dissatisfaction with her hair (she has fabulous blonde curls) perhaps because she's witnessed too many of my frizzy-hair freak-outs. I caught her the other day staring into the mirror and stretching out one of her glorious ringlets. Is she destined to be a worrier? Can I stop that? Or will everything I do make it more likely? </p> <p>There's no doubt I've become more anxious since becoming a mother. My fear of falling down stairs only started after my daughter was born; I tortured myself with thoughts of slipping while carrying my precious bundle. My hypochondria also intensified, and I became scared of swimming in the sea (I put these down to the post-natal realisation that another human really depends on me to remain alive, and healthy). </p> <p>But these protective concerns can themselves produce negative effects. In spring last year, after Madeleine McCann disappeared, I became deeply anxious about my daughter's safety and let her come into our bed at night. I liked having her next to me, just to hear her breathing, and knowing she was all right. The result: she developed a fear of sleeping in her own room and it took us most of the autumn to coax her back into her own bed. </p> <p>The American author and academic Katie Roiphe recognises high levels of anxiety in herself and believes that passing it on to Violet, her six-year-old daughter, is inevitable. 'I think it's impossible not to pass along that temperament,' she says. 'When I was a child I was afraid of the wind - even when I was six months old, I was that afraid of the universe. It's impossible that I should get a calm child. I look at some children who are unflappable and think that would be nice for my daughter, but I don't think it's going to happen. My daughter worries about a million things: that if she is going to drink from someone else's straw she will turn into that person. She has supernatural worries.' </p> <p>But can anxiety really be explained entirely by the influence of neurotic parents, or high levels of cortisol laid down in childhood? The sudden, recent increase in anxiety among adults stressing about climate change and economic collapse suggests not. Could it be caused by consumerism, which we grow into more slowly?</p> <p>It could, says Tom Hodgkinson, editor of The Idler and author of the inspirational How to Be Free. He believes that our economic system functions precisely by keeping us anxious. We're encouraged to believe, at all times, that we're just one purchase away from happiness: 'Anxious people make good consumers and good workers. Anxiety will drive us back into our comfort blankets of credit-card shopping and bad food - the system deliberately produces anxiety while simultaneously promising to take it away.' </p> <p>The writer and professional worrier William Leith agrees. He breaks off from writing a new book, Bits of Me are Falling Apart, to elaborate: 'Gordon Brown is always telling us that our economy has to grow, otherwise we will fall apart. What does that mean? It means that everyone has to make you buy stuff all the time. And the way they do this is by constantly advertising. Advertising is about making you feel anxious: you're too fat, or you need a new kitchen. We live in a world where you can be playing golf and, on finally putting the ball, you find inside the hole an ad for a car. You walk away thinking, \"I should buy a Lexus.\"'</p> <p>Oliver James makes a similar case in his book Affluenza. And if we're anxious in the good times, economic downturn will be so much worse. Since the advent of the credit crunch, he argues, significant numbers of people will have been 'shitting themselves'. Their cortisol levels, he contends, will be through the ceiling. 'They will be worrying themselves silly and will become physically ill. They might start showing OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) symptoms, trying to create something safe out of this very dangerous situation. They might think: \"If I say 100 Hail Marys before leaving the house at least there is something I can do.\"'</p> <p>If that's what they're doing, I can sympathise. At times of particular stress (or, as my husband would tell you, every night), I find myself compelled to check the front door several times. I also have a little routine for checking the cooker is turned off. I blame my husband for this: he has occasionally forgotten to turn off the gas, and if he's cavalier about the cooker then how can I be sure about the front door? But I daresay that James would point to other, deeper reasons for my obsessive checking.</p> <p>Leith believes that obsessive compulsive behaviour masks deeper anxieties. 'If I am worried about a big thing like, \"I'm a complete failure, half my life has gone and I'm going to be dead soon\", the incidental worries get worse. If I'm sitting at my desk to start writing, I might think, \"Oh, God, I can't write, I just can't do it, I just can't do it. Oh, God.\" At those times, I might need to check the cooker in case the house is burning down.'</p> <p>Despite holding consumerism responsible, James believes that therapy can help. He particularly recommends something called the Hoffman Process, which he himself has undergone. But this seems to involve whacking cushions and pretending they are your parents, and to me it sounds horribly like the Freudian analyst I saw years ago - but worse, and more expensive. </p> <p>Hodgkinson, more appealingly, encourages us to take matters into our own hands and simply shed the burden - 'the dreadful, gnawing, stomach-churning sense that things are awry, mixed with a chronic sense of powerlessness ... forever hoping, fearing or regretting'. </p> <p>In How to Be Free, Hodgkinson sets out a comprehensive list of methods to encompass this liberation. These include gardening, ceasing to read newspapers or watch telly, and embracing a fatalistic theology. 'Catholics are probably less anxious than Protestants,' Hodgkinson argues. 'Buddhists are certainly less anxious than Jews.'</p> <p>My husband has similar ideas. He frequently urges me to read the works of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk and best-selling self-help master. Once in a while, I give it a go. The general thrust seems to be that we should learn to live in the moment, by for instance concentrating on our breath. 'Mindful breathing helps us stop being preoccupied by sorrows of the past and anxieties of the future,' Nhat Hanh writes in one book. 'It helps us be in touch with life in the present moment.'</p> <p>But worry creeps up on us even when we're counting our breaths and living in the moment. It's Leith, typically downbeat, who points this out to me. It happens, for instance, when he's negotiating pedestrian crossings with his three-year-old son: 'Before you cross,' he says, 'you wait for the green man. But what if there's no traffic coming? Should I stick to my guns and wait? Or should I cross the road? If so, surely he will realise that this is an exception? But then again, I want him to understand it has to turn green before he even thinks of crossing. I don't want him to think there's an either/or. Am I being over-anxious? There may be an appropriate level of anxiety, but no one knows what it is.'</p>",
  "<p>Not even the British reluctance to embrace hard-headed professionalism, that inbred suspicion of success strove for rather than bestowed, could take the lustre off this sometimes shambling country's single best day at an Olympic Games for a hundred years. </p> <p>Four golds, one silver and four bronze medals - this was not a day for grudging recognition by sceptics. There could be a swag of golds again today. By the time the nation goes back to work tomorrow, we will be punch-drunk from celebrating, sick of the national anthem, and just a little proud of the cyclists, rowers, swimmers and sailors who are turning it on when it matters. </p> <p>Wiggins, Hoy, Adlington, four men in a boat (Williams, James, Reed and Trigg), two women in a boat (Laverick and Bebington), Rowbotham, Wells, Burke, Newton, Edgar - these are the names that lit up various parts of Beijing and other venues on what will inevitably be called Super Saturday. </p> <p>Those athletes left in the Olympic village of the 311 who travelled in hope were giving full-throated acknowledgment to their team-mates into the night. So were the media. So were the trainers. So were the suits. If a little over the top - a rerun perhaps of that day in Trafalgar Square three years ago when people who had only a passing interest in cricket hailed the England team who had won back the Ashes, or the rugby union boys in 2003 - it was justified. </p> <p>The Barmy Army apart, if you can't sing when you're winning, when can you sing? </p> <p>Simon Clegg, a chef de mission who has presided over serial British disappointments and undelivered promises at previous Games, did well to contain his joy. 'In Athens four years ago we had an epic day on 21 August, perhaps the most successful day in British Olympic history,' he said, skating over for the moment the mediocrity of quite a few campaigns. 'But we do believe that this is the most successful day since 1908. </p> <p>'In fact, there was a day in 1908 when Great Britain won eight gold medals, five in shooting and three in the tennis, five silver and six bronze. It's going to be fairly challenging for us ever to better that, but then you can forget that 34 per cent of the participating athletes in 1908 were actually made up by the British team.' </p> <p>There will not be that percentage in London in four years' time, but, as athletes from the host nation do not have to qualify, the opportunity is there for Britain to build on what has been an extremely encouraging week, with the prospect of many more medals to come. </p> <p>Today, the sailors are guaranteed gold or silver in both the Yngling and Finn classes. Sailing was abandoned yesterday because of light winds, otherwise the medal count would have been even higher. </p> <p>Ben Ainslie, the country's greatest man in control of a sea-going vessel since Sir Francis Drake, leads the American Zach Railey by five points in the Finn; the Yngling women 'just have to stay ahead of the Dutch team to take the gold', as Clegg pointed out. Simple. </p> <p>'Team GB is in really good spirits at the moment,' he said. 'There is a huge buzz around the Olympic village. Everyone is walking around confident that over the remaining eight days we can continue to build on [our] success. </p> <p>'I'd say our achievements are very much in line with where I'd expected them to be from a [total] medal perspective, but certainly there are more golds than I had anticipated. The total medal tally ... I was working on about 18 medals at this stage; there are 17 today.' </p> <p>When Clegg and other team leaders refused to be drawn on specific targets before they arrived, it was felt they might have been retreating to a failsafe position in anticipation of a poor showing. Perhaps it was just caution built on experience. Now they can all throw that to the wind - of which there is expected to be an excess in the sailing today. </p> <p>So how much has it cost? Many, many millions, driven by Lottery funding, organised by UK Sport, institutions not universally loved but providers of cash when it was needed. And, as Clegg points out, it has been an investment in 2012 as much as in the squad competing in China. 'I can assure there will be a full analysis when we return so that those sports that may not have delivered in line with expectations here have the opportunity to step up to the mark.' </p> <p>A bit dry, a bit bottom-line. But it's all about the money now. If we want days like this, the price is a bit of romance sacrificed, the old ethos flung to the side. There are no chariots of fire any more, but lots of centres of excellence. </p> <p>As the bronze medallist rower Elise Laverick was happy to acknowledge. She and Anna Bebington missed gold by 0.23 seconds, behind the New Zealanders and Germans in the double sculls. It could not stop her smiling afterwards. </p> <p>'When you're competing, you just concentrate on your own event,' she said, 'but it is phenomenal to be part of such a successful village team.' </p> <p>There is a tangible buzz of community about the British athletes, from the boxers, who still have three in the tournament, to the cyclists, who are extraordinary. 'In the rowing team, we've got 10 boats in finals, and five going tomorrow,' Laverick said. 'This is my third Olympics and it is definitely the strongest team I've ever been part of. It's just fantastic to be here.' </p> <p>She is in no doubt how it happened. 'Before we get here, we don't just spend hours and hours of hard work [training]. We have a fantastic support network at home, which we could not do without - the Institute Of Sport, with UK Sport backing us up all the way through, with physios and doctors and great facilities. And things are only going to get better over the next four years.' </p> <p>The point was emphasised by Sebastian Coe, figurehead of the London Games. 'From Sydney to Athens, Athens to Beijing there has been increased funding, targeted at individuals and coaches, and this [nine medals in a day] is what you get. Track and field has a very hard act to follow.'</p> <p>Rebecca Adlington, catapulted from relative obscurity to within sight of being the sporting star of the year, won her second gold medal in the pool, one more than the unmatchable cycling genius, Bradley Wiggins - who could get two more. Now she wants to have some fun. 'It's been a bit of a whirlwind to be honest,' she said of not only her brilliant swimming but the attention heaped on her. 'I haven't had a chance to sit down and properly take in what I've done. I just want to enjoy the last week of the Games and watch the other sports.' </p> <p>Don't we all? If sport is good for anything - apart from stretching the human spirit - it is surely a harmless vehicle for making people happy. </p> <p>Adlington is only 19 and still utterly without side or cynicism. 'I just get in the pool and push myself to the limit every single session. That's what got me here.' </p> <p>They are, says Clegg, members of 'a very special club'. He added: 'We are a country of 65 million people and yet, over the last 112 years, only 6,519 people have had the privilege of representing our country at the Olympic Games. That number has been swelled by 311 here in Beijing. These are very special people.' </p> <p>And there will be even more of them in London in four years' time, whatever the naysayers say.</p>",
  "<p>Forty years ago this week, the night sky above Prague began to rumble with the sound of transport aircraft. On distant frontiers, tanks lurched forward. The invasion of Czechoslovakia had begun.</p> <p>Today, there are Russian tank columns driving along Georgian roads. Again, a small country lies prostrate before the military power of the Kremlin. Poland, in turn, is informed by a Russian general that by agreeing to station American missiles, it has made itself a nuclear target - perhaps no more than a brutal statement of the obvious.</p> <p>But there are big differences between now and 1968. First, the Georgians fought back before being overwhelmed, something they will remember in the years to come. Second, this is something less than total occupation. Anything may still happen, but this Russian action looks more like a punitive expedition.</p> <p>What do the Russians want? The world does not yet know. Possibly the Russians do not know either; their tradition is to enter a crisis with several contrary game plans and then to play it by ear. But some short-term purposes are already clear.</p> <p>They want to destroy Georgia's military hardware so thoroughly it will take a decade to rebuild. That is what the roving armoured units are doing. They want to upgrade their 'peacekeeping' forces in South Ossetia and Abkhazia so Georgia will never dare to attack across their borders again. They want to discredit President Mikheil Saakashvili so utterly that the Georgian people will depose him. They want to show the world the sort of price which would be paid for taking Georgia into Nato and also to suggest that Georgia is too erratic to be a Nato partner.</p> <p>But Russia may also have plans for a new relationship with Georgia. While Condoleezza Rice and other Western leaders try to implement the cease-fire, President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin would like to get rid of all these international mediators, above all the Americans. They would almost certainly prefer to impose on defeated Georgia a new bilateral treaty with the Russian Federation. Any such treaty may well include returning to Russia one or more of the military bases in Georgia which they reluctantly evacuated a few years ago.</p> <p>By this weekend, Russian forces had ceased to shoot but Georgia's agony continued. Much more terrible than the soldiers are the civilians who come behind them, big-bellied men with machine pistols wearing army jackets thrown over T-shirts. They are doing the murdering, looting and burning, as they drive the last Georgians out of South Ossetia. Now they can reach Georgian territory as far as Gori, so they are following and killing them there.</p> <p>They are Ossetians, helped by Chechen volunteers and by ultra-patriotic Russian 'Cossacks'. A year ago, most of these Ossetians probably lived in neighbourly peace with the local Georgians in the next village. But the spark of war ignites madness. The neighbours became traitors, spies, saboteurs, snipers.</p> <p>These gunmen are Ossetians, but if Saakashvili's surprise attack had succeeded, the killers would be Georgians and the victims Ossetians. The first outrush of Ossetian refugees from the fighting in Tskhinvali reported that Georgian atrocities against them had already started.</p> <p>Now the outrush is Georgian. They will become helpless, homeless IDPs - internal displaced persons - crowded into dirty huts and abandoned factories with thousands of older IDPs who have been rotting on the fringe of Georgian society for 15 years.</p> <p>For all this has happened before.</p> <p>That is the worst thing about the tragic war over South Ossetia. The impetuous Georgian resort to force, the appeal to Russian armed strength giving Russia a chance to weaken Georgia's independence, the terrible crimes carried out by civilians of the winning side against the helpless families of the losing side, the ethnic cleansing, the refugees - all these horrors happened here only 15 years ago.</p> <p>The trouble in Abkhazia began when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. Georgia moved to full independence, asserting that Abkhazia was part of its territory. The Abkhazians retorted that association with Georgia within the Soviet framework had been one thing; downgrading to an ethnic minority directly and exclusively ruled from Tbilisi was quite another. Agitation began.</p> <p>Then in August 1992, the Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze suddenly flung the army against Abkhazia. Like Saakashvili, he tried to reassert control by bombarding and seizing the capital, Sokhumi. Violent fighting broke out. In the war that followed, Russian weaponry and air strikes helped little Abkhazia - with less than a tenth of Georgia's population - to an unexpected victory.</p> <p>When it was over, Abkhazia's towns and villages lay in ruins. And atrocities had followed the fighting troops. At first, it was the Georgian militias who did their worst against non-Georgian civilians. But then, as the war turned their way, Abkhazian paramilitaries and the wild north Caucasus volunteers who had swarmed in to help them took indiscriminate vengeance. Almost the entire Georgian and Mingrelian population, some 150,000, fled with the Georgian army. Many of them live in bleak refugee settlements to this day.</p> <p>The point of this history is that nobody learnt anything from it, nobody except the Russians. So history has repeated itself. In the years that followed, Georgian politicians failed to see that only imaginative diplomacy, not bombardment by rockets, might bring about some kind of rapprochement with South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p> <p>The Abkhazians, independent but recognised by nobody, have no choice but to accept unofficial Russian hegemony. But at heart they resent it. They dream of escaping into the big world and genuine independence. Saakashvili, when he came to power, could have exploited that resentment by making a fresh start with Abkhazia. A few gestures and proposals were made. But the Abkhazian leaders, grimly suspicious, rejected them all as eyewash. Saakashvili, they insisted, was a nationalist demagogue who intended to recapture both Abkhazia and smaller South Ossetia by force. Today they are entitled to say: 'We told you so.'</p> <p>It's time the West stopped talking about 'Georgian territorial integrity', and about South Ossetia and Abkhazia as 'breakaway regions of Georgia', as if their 'illegal secession' can somehow be reversed. It cannot. That useless dream is dead. The question now is quite different. It is how their independence can be recognised and made real. Only in that way can the outside world make it harder for Russia to use them as pawns in the game of crippling Georgian freedom.</p> <p>It may not be possible to rescue South Ossetia, tiny and without resources, from becoming a Russian protectorate or even part of the Russian Federation - and most of its people seem to want that. But Abkhazia, with its once-flourishing holiday coast and rich agriculture, can be a perfectly viable Black Sea state. The European Union has a Black Sea neighbourhood programme. It's time for the EU to stop pretending that Abkhazia does not exist, to integrate it into the programme and to give it vigorous help.</p> <p>And Georgia, that miraculous little nation which contains some of the world's most talented people, and some of its worst politicians, must change. It is not Georgia which has been defeated, but a particular Georgian policy which has again and again played into Russian hands.</p> <p>We know now that Russia's revival as a big power is under way. Outside competition for influence over the ex-Soviet nations is going to be fiercely resisted. After Georgia comes Ukraine, where attempts to join Nato could end by splitting the nation and, with the Russian fleet still based in Crimea, bring about a terrifying confrontation.</p> <p>Nato, with the Americans, can protect its own members against blackmail by standing firm. But the brutal truth is that if Nato is to survive, it must not sign up nations for which at heart it is not prepared to fight. The best way to prevent war is not windy condemnation, but clear, credible rules of engagement. Bluffing can be fatal.</p>",
  "<p>Last weekend in New York, my husband coyly announced that a big story had just broken that would destroy former presidential hopeful John Edwards's career. He wouldn't say what had happened (getting scoops before I do always makes him feel superior), but I guessed the bare bones. What would be more ruinous for a politician whose hugely popular wife has terminal cancer than an affair?</p> <p>So, in defiance of a long-standing ban on eating dinner in front of the TV, we curled up on the couch with our calamari. At 11.30pm, John Edwards gave a one-off interview on ABC's Nightline about his 'very serious mistake' with campaign aide Rielle Hunter in 2006. However sentimental, maudlin, bathetic and fake, it was great entertainment, although my recurring nausea didn't do justice to the squid.</p> <p>John Edwards's televised self-flagellation followed established form for sexually outed public servants. Humiliating confessional drivel about his having suffered from 'a self-focus, an egotism, a narcissism' confuses politics with psychotherapy. In fact, the 2008 campaign coverage is awash in the language of psychiatry (after Hillary's defeat, her supporters needed to 'heal' and 'find closure' and her name should be submitted in nomination at the convention for the sake of 'catharsis'), as if politicians don't run a country but a support group.</p> <p>The US has a history of priapic politicians whose shenanigans provide the public with voyeuristic evenings like last weekend's. Front-runner Gary Hart bowed out of the 1988 presidential race after being photographed with an extramarital young woman on his knee. Bill Clinton managed to stage the forgive-me-but-I-have-sinned number not once but twice, first with Gennifer Flowers, then with Monica Lewinsky. New York governor Eliot Spitzer resigned in disgrace after being caught using an escort agency.</p> <p>Despite the ostensibly greater sophistication of Europeans about boys being boys, Britain has been showing an indiscreet curiosity about its politicians' private lives as well, sometimes with the co-operation of the politicians themselves. We know all about the cavortings of Boris Johnson, John Prescott and David Blunkett. Less contentiously, we've been treated to Nick Clegg's admission of a lifetime total of 30 lovers and David Cameron snogging - yawn! - his own wife on a beach.</p> <p>Does it matter how politicians conduct themselves with their trousers down?</p> <p>'Character' is a big buzzword in American politics, the assumption being that honesty, integrity, loyalty and decency in private will translate to public life. But politics is practical. I want a President who can rein in the deficit, design a national healthcare system and get the troops out of Iraq. None of these capacities is affected one way or another if either Obama or McCain cats around on his wife.</p> <p>Most jobs do not require a background check on marital fidelity and for good reason. The business world values competence over 'character', competence being a far rarer quality than virtue, and a country is, in its way, a business. Thus I do not want a 'good person' as President. I would vote for a perfect arsehole who got inflation back under 5 per cent.</p> <p>The one respect in which John Edwards's slip-up matters is this: the guy knew full well that his wife Elizabeth garners enormous public sympathy and, if he were discovered to have betrayed her, both the media and the voters would be merciless. (In his interview, Edwards was quick to point out that he cheated during her cancer's remission, adding disingenuously that, of course, that's 'no excuse in any possible way for what happened'.) He was running for President. So messing around with Rielle Hunter was stupid. Ditto Bill Clinton's diddling about with Monica, which was disturbing not for being immoral but for being stupid. In politics, nice counts for beans. Stupid matters.</p> <p>Nevertheless, poor judgment in matters of the heart - and especially in matters lower down - is pretty standard and does not necessarily imply poor judgment about tax policy. (To the British public's credit, Gordon would probably have done better in those byelections had he cheated on Sarah rather than eliminated the 10p tax band.)</p> <p>Then there's the issue of lying, of which Edwards did plenty when trying to keep his 'private life' worthy of the term. Certainly, Clinton suffered more for his arrogant denials than for the initial transgressions with a cigar. But you could make a case that being a skilful liar is a critical qualification for public office. (The prospect of one's leader swanning about the world telling the unvarnished truth is terrifying.) Recall, too, that Clinton backers carved out a special exemption for mendacity below the waist: 'All men lie about sex.' </p> <p>The aphorism being so encompassing, presumably they also lie about sex when their wives have cancer. Yet 'all men' in politics might not lie about sex if they were cut a little more slack and the consequences for honesty were not so dire.</p> <p>Fortunately, John Edwards's breast-beating and hair-tearing on ABC now has no consequences beyond his own embarrassment and whatever anguish he may have caused. Yet this latest spectacle raises the question of whether we want politicians to be paragons, role models, exemplary, stainless icons of respectability whom we can look up to or whether we would settle for well-informed, pragmatic, sensible people who have a sound ideas about how to resolve the mortgage crisis and who may or may not have racy personal lives that are none of our business. Do we want to use politicians for vicarious thrills, for soap opera and titillation or might we settle for getting our jollies from the bed-hopping in Hollywood?</p> <p>Because we pay a price for both the moralism and seedy curiosity. Were some semblance of a Chinese Wall restored between politicians' public and private lives, government might start attracting a better grade of candidate, with the kind of character that counts, distinguished by far-sightedness, pragmatism, fairness and - that rarest of qualities - frugality with other people's money. </p> <p>Until then, smart, capable people are going to think twice about applying for a job that may involve the kind of sorry displays of self-prostration that Edwards provided. Far better to have told the press that whether his carrying on with a campaign aide fathered a 'love child' is his business, full stop. If punters' comments on ABC's web page are anything to go by ('How do you spell worm? JOHN!'), his begging for the nation's forgiveness backfired, and he'd have been better off keeping his dignity.</p> <p>Is this purely a male issue? For the time being. Because if Hillary had been caught having an affair during the primaries, she might have won the nomination by a mile.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Lionel Shriver's latest novel is The Post-Birthday World (HarperCollins, 2007)</p>",
  "<h2>Letter of the week</h2> <p>I'm a bereft greyhound racing fan who, with yesterday's closure of Walthamstow Stadium, faces a much longer journey to Wimbledon. I've been considering trips to other classic stadiums but my wife, not unreasonably, is unwilling to undertake a long trip just for a night at the dogs. Where can we combine the racing, an upmarket hotel and good shopping?<br><strong>Alan Stones, east London</strong></p> <p>Try Leeds. Train fares from London start at \u00a38 each way second class, \u00a314 first class at <a href=\"http://www.nationalexpresseastcoast.co.uk\">nationalexpresseastcoast.co.uk</a>. In Leeds check into Quebecs (0113 244 8989; <a href=\"http://www.theetoncollection.com\">theetoncollection.com</a>), across City Square from the station. It has shopping weekend packages at \u00a3195 per night for a de luxe double, including breakfast, champagne and chocolates on arrival and a discount card for the upmarket Victoria Quarter shopping arcades. Hop on a Sheffield or Doncaster-bound Metro train stopping at Fitzwilliam. A short walk from the station is Kinsley greyhound stadium (01977 625124; <a href=\"http://www.kinsleydogs.co.uk\">kinsleydogs.co.uk</a>), with races on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Entry is \u00a35.60. You could also go to Brighton: stay at the rock'n'roll-themed Hotel Pelirocco (01273 327055; <a href=\"http://www.hotelpelirocco.co.uk\">hotelpelirocco.co.uk</a>) then head out to the Brighton &amp; Hove stadium races, pictured above (see <a href=\"http://www.brightonandhovegreyhoundstadium.co.uk\">brightonandhovegreyhoundstadium.co.uk</a>).</p> <p><strong>Q </strong>I am renting, with friends, an apartment in Venice for a week in October. As a week is quite a long time for a city break and I'm more of a modernist when it comes to architecture and art, can you suggest where else we might visit using public transport for day trips? It's difficult to tell which places are easy to reach and what we might see.<br><strong>Carol Green, Oxford</strong></p> <p>Don't discount Venice entirely. Its modernist architecture is limited, but there are a few pieces scattered around the city. The work of Venetian-born Carlo Scarpa can be seen at the Olivetti Showroom in Piazza San Marco and the entrance to the Institute of Venetian Architecture in Campo Tolentini in the Santa Croce district. The pavilions at the end of the Giardini Pubblici in the Castello district are also worth a nose around, even if you're not there at Biennale time. Scarpa also designed several museum interiors in Venice - the Palazzo Querini-Stampalia in Castell, for example. For trips outside the city there are plenty of interesting options within reach. The Banca Popolare di Verona, in the city of the same name, is another fine piece of work by the same architect. Many destinations near Venice have an older core with more modern touches, such as Verona, Vicenza and Treviso, but you may find the noted fascist-era and other 20th-century architecture of Brescia an interesting detour. It's an easy one-hour 45-minute train ride from Venice. Train times are available at <a href=\"http://www.trenitalia.it\">trenitalia.it</a>. You'll find plenty of modern art in Venice - the Peggy Guggenheim Collection and the Gallery of Modern Art inside the Ca' Pesaro are the best places to start. </p> <p><strong>Q </strong>My wife and I have decided on a round-the-world trip from January to March next year, initially overnighting in Singapore before flying to Cairns then on to Sydney, where we will pick up a hire car. Our plan is to drive to Melbourne and Adelaide over three weeks. Can you advise where we can obtain a directory of motels or equivalent accommodation along the route? On completion of this route, we have short stays in the Red Centre before visiting NZ, Fiji and finally San Francisco. Will we require anti-malarial tablets at any stage of our trip?<br><strong>S J Perry, Battle, East Sussex</strong></p> <p>Your handwritten letter gave me pause for thought as to whether you have internet access, which would make planning such a trip a doddle. In particular, the websites of individual Australian states you're passing through (<a href=\"http://www.visitnsw.com\">visitnsw.com</a>; <a href=\"http://www.visitvictoria.com\">visitvictoria.com</a>; <a href=\"http://www.southaustralia.com\">southaustralia.com</a>) have detailed accommodation listings, searchable by categories and destinations. Brochures are also downloadable, but printed versions can only be sent within Australia. </p> <p>Without the web, extensive planning will mean getting hold of a guidebook. January is summer holiday time and there's plenty of demand from local and international tourists, so making arrangements at least for the first few nights is a good idea. </p> <p>There's no need for anti-malarials for any destinations you're visiting, but it's a good idea to get other jabs and vaccinations up to date, including hepatitis A, tetanus, typhoid, polio and possibly rabies. Talk to your GP or travel clinic. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> A friend of mine was recently stopped from boarding a plane because her son had his wrist in a cast. They had checked in - the person on the check-in desk didn't notice because it was under the sleeve of his jumper - and they weren't trying to hide it, because they didn't realise it would be a problem. At the gate, one of the crew spotted it and would not allow him to board the plane. According to him, it is illegal to board an aircraft with a cast without a doctor's certificate of fitness to fly. Is this right?<br><strong>Victoria Cox, London</strong></p> <p>It depends on the airline. There is no legal requirement to have a doctor's note if you wear a cast; the only rule is that it must have been in place for more than 48 hours. Some airlines ask for no other proof of fitness to fly, while others insist on a doctor's note. All airlines print their regulations on their website and it is best to check. If, as in the case of your friend, the airline clearly states that a doctor's certificate is required before allowing a passenger ith a cast to board, it is legally within its rights to have stopped her son from boarding.</p>",
  "<p>The only time that I lived in what could reasonably have been described as a bedsitter, it benefited from a shared kitchen which meant that, though I still ate the same thing every day for six months - pasta with pesto from a jar - I was saved both the misery of my clothes smelling of this dish, and the drag of balancing said jar on my window ledge in order to keep its contents even vaguely fresh. Oh, and there was somewhere to wash up, so I didn't have to stick my one pot, plate and fork in a plastic bucket and lug it down the corridor to the bathroom at the close of every night or, let's be realistic, every week (this was actually doubly good news because I hated the idea of meeting the other inhabitants of my building, whose voices I could hear, but whose faces I had decided, in my excruciating youthful shyness, that I would rather never see; I used to time my dash to the kitchen with the EastEnders theme). But this is not to say that I do not have a working knowledge of true bedsitters - and yes, they do still exist, in spite of estate agents' profligate use of the term 'studio flat'. I love a good, boxy bedsitter, be it in an almost-forgotten novel of the 1950s, or an almost-forgotten film of the 1960s. I drive past buildings that I know, or assume, to house bedsits, their stucco peeling like eczema, their window frames rattling like old bones, and I cannot help myself from picturing the scene within: a dubious pot on an equally dubious single ring, the female in charge of it half-heartedly stirring its contents at the same time as she files her nails, reads an old Vogue, or chats to some distant parent on the telephone.</p> <p>This is, I fully admit, a pretty odd kind of nostalgia, and the person I blame for it mostly is Katharine Whitehorn, whose Cooking in a Bedsitter, first published in 1961, in print and regularly updated for the next 40 years, and now triumphantly reissued in all its original greasy and hardscrabble glory by Virago (I just wish they had made the cover wipe-clean), fuelled it for many years. Though I'm not the only one. My sister, who is a decade younger than me, suffers from it, too, and is often to be found picking over Whitehorn's advice about how useful the inhabitant of a bedsitter will find a jug - it can be used to make tea and coffee, or to cook kippers - or reading, for the ninth time, the author's warning that her recipe cooking times do not include 'the time it takes you to find the salt in the suitcase under the bed'. Whitehorn says that Virago are doing the book as a kind of retro joke, and she is probably right. But however much fun it is - 'there is one powerful smell associated with making coffee in bedsitters; it is the smell of burning plastic, and will go away if you move the handle of the pot away from the flame' - if you want to know just how much eating and cooking and even living habits have changed in the years since rationing went out, and supermarkets, fridge freezers and naked greed came in, this is the Ur text. Start reading, and I guarantee that you will soon be able to smell boiled cabbage, no matter where you happen to be. Plus, the recipes, those of them that don't sound too off-putting to vacuum-wrapped, oven-ready ears, like Turbigo kidneys or tripe Catalan, do still work. Whitehorn cooked The Dish - a foolproof combination of braising steak, flour, herbs, tomato paste and vegetables - twice last week, and not one of her guests asked if the hostess couldn't please call up for a takeaway curry. </p> <p>'You know how copy editors always have to change a few things?' says Whitehorn, in a deep and suitably retro voice that is two parts Diana Rigg to one part James Mason. 'She asked me if we shouldn't call tunny, tuna. No! That's the whole point. To do it as it was. I think if they had instead asked me to bring it up to date, I would have had to say no, because I really don't know how people live now. In the end, we only changed two things. One is my advice that cooks use an asbestos mat under a pan to slow cooking down, for obvious reasons. The other thing is that I have put Gavin's byline on the end of the chapter about drink [Gavin Lyall, the crime writer and Whitehorn's husband, who died in 2003], because that seemed to me to be only fair; he wrote it.' And, as she went through the proofs, how did she feel about the book, after all these years? 'Well, what struck me really is the vast variety of things that I knew about which, if you had asked me, I would have insisted that I didn't know about. Did I really know all those things?' Living alone again, she doesn't cook much now. 'Parma ham and melon is about the top of it.'</p> <p>When Cooking in a Bedsitter was commissioned, Whitehorn was no kind of cook at all, a fact she carefully concealed from her new publisher. She had just been sacked from her job at Woman's Own. 'I had a burning desire for some work, simple as that.' But she had experience of bedsit land? 'Yes. There had been two. One in Streatham, a rather prissy one where men weren't allowed to come in [there is a whole section in CIAB on landladies, the horror of]. It was a reasonably nice room, but it was in Streatham. Then I got one in Notting Hill Gate, and in the same terrace lived the previous boyfriend. I never ran into him, but there was always the awful fear that one might.' By the time she began writing, however, she was married and sharing a tiny flat with Gavin so, to get into the mood, she borrowed the bedsit of a friend who was in the process of moving out. 'I spilt something disgusting on the carpet, and thought: thank God he's moving! In fact, he was going to take that carpet with him. Anyway, what was realistic about the book was that it wasn't just cooking on one ring; it was all these other ghastly complications.' By complications, she means: the aforementioned landladies; lingering smells; the problem of water, and having to fetch it from a shared bathroom; the lack of a fridge, and the difficulty of storing foods that went off quickly. Also, she had to provide a full glossary. Elizabeth David had long since told everyone about olive oil, but lots of things remained mysterious, and still had to be explained, among them aubergines, pimentos and zucchini ('small Italian marrows'). </p> <p>In those days, any woman who was not extremely rich cooked an awful lot (in 1958, 38 per cent of women cooked - and I mean cooked - three meals a day). Whitehorn, however, had not been encouraged to learn to do so as a young woman because her mother, who was Scottish, had been brought up to believe in 'plain living and high thinking', and found cooking boring. (In any case, if she did ever try anything new, Katharine's father, a classics master at Marlborough College, would only ask: 'Why aren't we having mince?' His favourite pudding was a 'ghastly' concoction of chocolate and cornflour, which he liked so much, he would stand ceremonially on a chair to serve it.) She only finally found herself standing over a stove when she went to study in America after her degree at Cambridge, and took her turn cooking for her flatmates (there, she also enjoyed pleasures unavailable at home, such as real orange juice; rationing, don't forget, had only finally ended in 1954). </p> <p>And when she married, was it her job to put the dinner on the table even though she had a job? 'Yes. But I welcomed it. When you marry, all the things you have to bloody do anyway, you're suddenly doing for somebody you love, and it's all much better. Of course, the reverse is true now [since Gavin died]. It's back to being a bloody chore.' This is not to say that wifely cooking was not challenging at first. 'In the flat, we had a marvellous Ideal stove. One day, I put a tinned steak and kidney pie in it. I also decided to try cooking frozen peas in the oven with butter, which was just as well because, when I opened the oven to see how they were doing, the tin was like this.' She mimes the shape of a mushroom cloud. 'I took it out of the oven, and pierced the tin, at which point a huge geyser of gravy shot out of the top of it, heading straight for the ceiling. Ha!'</p> <p>Whitehorn, of course, is such a great writer and such a cool-headed journalist that, as you read her recipes for 'shrimp wiggle' and 'lamb tomato quickie', for 'poulet Marengo' and 'Swedish sausage casserole', you might think her a stranger to such disasters. When, for instance, she smoothly explains, for those without a whisk, how to beat an egg white on a plate with knife - so much less wearying than going at it with a fork in a cup - she sounds as though she performs this feat every night of the week, and probably at the same time as she amends her packed engagement diary.</p> <p>When she was younger, and one of the most famous, if not the most famous journalist in Britain, Whitehorn's diary was sometimes a little too packed and, lately, it is that way again; her memoir, Selective Memory, which came out last year, signalled her recovery - as much as it is possible to recover from the end of a marriage of 45 years - from the loss of Gavin, and the start, once again, of a single life. Work is not a balm, exactly, but it 'leads you into a lot of life of various sorts... one of the reasons I buy my clothes in sales or British Home Stores is that I go around with women who are younger and richer than me, and if I spent what they do on clothes, I wouldn't be able to afford the hotels'. She fell for Gavin, a pilot turned newspaper air correspondent, and journalism at pretty much the same time, when she started work on the Picture Post following a brief stint in publishing ('I was pretty wet about publishing,' she says. 'It didn't occur to me that I was in the wrong job.') and stuck with them both through thick and thin. In a way, one fed the other, her life with Lyall informing the best of the pieces that she wrote for The Observer, where she began as fashion editor ('to catch the atmosphere of the Paris collections, you must lock yourself in a hot cupboard with a bottle of spilled scent and a champagne hangover') and ended as columnist ('Have you ever taken anything out of the dirty clothes basket because it had become, relatively, the cleaner thing?'), with stints of reporting in between (she was at The Observer from 1960 until 1996). She wrote about having it all, or the impossibility of having it all, when the writers who go on about such things now were still at primary school, pinning the exhaustion of life with two children, a husband and a full-time career wryly to the page without ever seeming to moan. To sum up: she made women - and a lot of men, too - want to cheer.</p> <p>But the point is, she says now, that she did not feel like moaning. There was not much to moan about. Being a woman in a man's world worked to her advantage when it came to being appointed to the boards of organisations like British Airports (they wanted a woman, and she would do). Meanwhile, back in The Observer office, she was blessed with an editor, George Seddon, who recognised her talent and loved her voice. '[On the women's page], we were protected from the sourpusses in the main paper, the mittel-Europeans who thought they were serious.' </p> <p>But seriously: how did she get everything done? When I read Selective Memory, I felt weak at the thought of her schedule, and I am Protestant to my very toenails. 'I think I probably did overdo it,' she says. 'And I think Gavin probably did resent it. But one of the things that is so different from me and my daughter-in-law is that I had an amazing amount of help: the marvellous Trudi, who came from 10 till three every weekday, and missed only one day in 17 years.' Professional salaries went further, and help cost less. 'Also, Gavin was at home [writing], if there was a fire or something. I did get them up and put them to bed... unless we were going out. But there were times when Gavin said: \"Oh, for God's sake.\" He used to say it was the kids I was short-changing, but actually, it wasn't: it was him. Once, we went to a drinks party. We were supposed to stay for lunch, but Gavin didn't let us. I was furious. When I asked why, he said: 'Read a book on motherhood.' So I slapped his face and got a taxi home and, of course, when I got there, the help and the children were perfectly happy. I really don't think I did short-change the children, and I don't ever recall him complaining about the food.' She simply loved her job, and where was the crime in that? 'It was wonderful. Everything was great. In the right job, at last; married to the right man, at last; everyone thought I was terrific!' </p> <p>I wonder if she thinks things are better, or worse, for women now, and what she makes of the trend - it feels like a trend to me - for successful, educated women to abandon entirely their jobs in order to bring up children full-time. 'Well, we have more choices, all of us. But choice doesn't necessarily make you happier. People say the steam seems to have gone out of feminism, but the answer is that they've got so much of what they wanted, and it doesn't seem to occur to them that they didn't always have these things. I understand the resentment of the women who only get a \u00a31m bonus when the men get \u00a32m, or whatever, but considering the things most people have to worry about... The decline in marriage has made things much tougher, I think. This business of cohabiting, the whole question of not knowing whether your relationships are meant to be permanent. It's a great strain.' Does she feel, though, that in some ways things are going backwards for women? 'The clue to this is something my son said. When my daughter-in-law stayed at home with her second child, I was a bit surprised. But Bernard said: \"In your day, female empowerment meant not having to give up a job you loved because you wanted a family. But for her generation, it means doing what you want, and she wants to stay at home.\" Given how long we're all living, maybe people will start to have careers at the ends of their lives. Perhaps it won't be necessary to do everything at the beginning. We're living another 30 bloody years after retirement, and a 30-year sabbatical is not on the cards, so career patterns are going to have to change. I believe people are going to have to work longer, and that they will be a damn sight happier if they do, though I know it's easy for me, because I'm a journalist and that's fun; it's not the same if you're scrubbing floors. Then again, women have always worked for something more than the work itself, because their work hasn't, traditionally, been particularly enjoyable. They work for the money, the autonomy, and for the company.'</p> <p>Talking about this stuff, it seems rather ironic that, of all the many words she has written, the book of Whitehorn's that is now being republished is about cookery. Then again, since all the evidence suggests that it is still women who continue to do most of the housework, irrespective of whether or not they have a job, Cooking in a Bedsitter has value both as a time-saving, cheat's guide - most of the recipes are lightning fast - and as a reminder of the dangers of the backwards glance: old-fashioned domesticity, which so many of us foolishly believe that we long for, was - and is - bloody hard work, even if you do have a fail-safe recipe for chicken \u00e0 la king or corned beef hash permanently up your sleeve. Oh yes, and when it all gets on top of you, you can always calm yourself with Whitehorn's words on puddings: 'In the play The Shrike, the hero is entertaining his girl to dinner and she says: \"What's for dessert?\" And there is no dessert; and he tries to commit suicide. This is an extreme view... hand round some chocolates.' Personally, I fully expect Cooking in a Bedsitter to be in print for at least another 40 years. It's a classic, isn't it? </p> <p>'Oh, do you think I'm up there with Hannah Glasse and Mrs Beeton?' purrs Whitehorn. She laughs. 'Nah! Not really.' </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Cooking in a Bedsitter is published by Virago, \u00a38.99.

Then melt the jelly, add about one-quarter of the fruit to it. Pour over the sponge cake. Leave that in a cool place while you make up the lemon pie filling according to the directions on packet. When it is ready, spread half the cherries and all of the remaining fruit on to the sponge-and-jelly mixture. Pour over the rest of the alcohol, and then the lemon filling. Slice the bananas and add to the filling. Some will sink in, some won't. Near the time of serving, whip the cream, add a heaped teaspoon of sugar to it, spread evenly on trifle and - at the last moment, because they sometimes sink in - decorate with the remaining cherries and halved walnuts. Whatever you leave out, don't leave out the fruit. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Recipes from Cooking in a Bedsitter by Katharine Whitehorn</p>",
  "<p>Restaurant kitchens are amazing,' says Norman Cook, hovering hungrily over a slab of raw tuna. 'They all have an air of mad panic. I get my kicks pretending to help, watching everyone rush around, crazy. It's like being inside a film.' </p> <p>Cook, 44, best known as DJ Fatboy Slim, has a stake in New York gastropub the Spotted Pig, and earlier this year relaunched Japanese restaurant Okinami, in the centre of Brighton, overlooking the Royal Pavilion. 'I used to do the odd shift at the Spotted Pig - it was one of the perks of being an investor - but since they got their Michelin star I'm not allowed in the kitchen. Once, in Brighton, Okinami got really busy, so I was thrown in to help. I badly burned my hands, which isn't a good idea when you have to DJ that night.'</p> <p>First inspired to make music after seeing Donny Osmond on TV, Cook (real name Quentin) has climbed through the charts, first in the Housemartins in the 1980s, then Beats International, and Freakpower, before finding stardom (and love, with wife Zo\u00eb Ball) as Fatboy Slim. As well as his split of the restaurants, he also owns a share of Brighton and Hove Albion football club. 'I've certainly learnt some life lessons through all my ventures,' he sighs. 'I've learnt that everything costs four times as much and takes three times as long as you think it will.'</p> <p>Cook, who lists his passions as 'music, women, football and food, in that order, obviously', learnt to cook when his son, Woody, now seven, was born. 'When I first started,' he says, 'I'd ring up Jamie Oliver in Australia asking, \"exactly how much is a glug of oil?\" He really got me going. He made me believe I could do it.' </p> <p>Okinami's chef, Mike Dodd, gazes fondly at Cook. 'He's a much respected icon in Brighton, and he's not like your usual celebrity,' Dodd gushes. 'I mean, I've had Noel Gallagher swearing his face off in the restaurant, and I put him in his place. He came in with an entourage, asking \"Where are the f-ing chips?\" I said, \"In the f-ing kebab shop, mate\". He came back sheepishly the next night and had a nice, quiet meal, and it was all OK.' </p> <p>Cook's tried the whole menu ('my favourite dish is the scallops with garlic butter and wasabi mayonnaise'), so he's moving along to cocktails. Dodd enthuses about their Japanese mojitos and cherry blossom margaritas, with rose tequila and sake. He is in charge of the kitchen, cutting tuna to make it look like crashing waves. </p> <p>Cook though, is in charge of the music. 'Well, it's the only thing I'm qualified to do,' he smiles. 'I made a whole album of ambient, fairly chilled stuff to play while people are eating - I never released it, just did it for fun - but I love it. I love how it affects the vibe of the restaurant, and then how it affects your eating experience.' </p> <p>He's now thinking about producing a compilation album 'of Okinami's greatest hits. And I dare say I'll launch it exclusively in the restaurant.' <br><strong>Eva Wiseman</strong></p> <h2>Okinami (est.

  "<p><strong>Kings of Leon</strong><br>Brixton Academy, London SW9</p> <p>Scientists have devised computer programmes to plot the likely spread of bird flu. Motorway managers have algorithms that can explain the wave patterns in bumper-to-bumper traffic. How is it, then, that no one has yet invented software with which to graph the spread of fandom? A computer screen filled with little coloured spores - in the style of Andrew Marr's Britain From Above, say - would reveal the progress of the Nashville-based Kings of Leon as an unpromising little cluster shooting out tentative, spidery beams <br>of light, and then culminating in a firework display. </p> <p>Tonight's baying crowd finds the objects of their affections poised to go solar. There's Nathan Followill, the eldest brother, high up on a drum riser, his long hair tickling his beefy shoulders. From behind, Nathan could be a hippie Lothario version of Olympic man-dolphin Michael Phelps. Unlike most drummers, Nathan takes almost equal spotlight billing to singer Caleb Followill. In turn, Caleb thwarts the clich\u00e9s about frontmen being show-offs and more charismatic than the rest of the band. </p> <p>Having done away with the absurd Nigel Tufnel haircut he was sporting earlier this summer, Caleb's pared-back hair mirrors a quiet confidence. During the encore he gets the crowd to continue chanting the 'oh woah ohs' of 'Knocked Up' with just one tiny finger gesture. Savouring the moment, he wiggles his hips. That is the extent of his stagecraft. He used to sing like his trouser seams were cleaving his groin into steaks but now there's more guts to his voice, unmangling his delivery a little. Either side of Caleb are Followills Matthew and Jared, on lead guitar and bass respectively. The directional hair and rocking out falls mostly to them. </p> <p>Behind Kings of Leon lies a successful Friday night headline spot at Glastonbury, when this notorious band of brothers-and-a-cousin officially revealed themselves to be one of Britain's favourite bands. Not bad for a bunch of chancers raised in the church blithely unaware of all rock music, who came into fashion in the wake of the Strokes. </p> <p>Ahead of the Kings rises a weekend at the V Festival, culminating in their Chelmsford set tonight . Consolidation is a foregone conclusion. Against the odds, the Followills have proven they have substance as well as stylists. Each album has seen their musicianship doggedly flower and absorb influences as hungrily as a Venus flytrap. The moustaches that suggested some affinity with Southern rock heritage are long since shaved off. They are now pulling ahead of their peers the Killers, another American stadium indie band whose heartland examinations are more popular over here than over there. The Strokes could well end up supporting them in the future.</p> <p>There are more changes. On the Kings' recent round of US gigs, girlfriends were on their tourbus, a change from the bacchanal of powders and STDs that characterised the band's early blossoming. Undeterred, Caleb blows kisses at the audience tonight and howls his way through the speed-country thump of 'Black Thumbnail', a rousing song about loveless sex and 'picking up speed'. At the other end of the set, 'Pistol of Fire' closes the tracklist with an extended, pared-back version of a previously forgettable song. You almost forget that the Kings are using a laughably simple metaphor for their penises here.</p> <p>In a month's time Kings of Leon will release their fourth work, Only By The Night. Its title unwittingly apes Oasis (the lumpy syntax) but it sounds not too far off U2 in places. If all goes to plan, this light-greedy band are set to play under even brighter rigs. Tonight's relatively intimate Brixton gig sold out in three minutes. Their forthcoming O2 gig in December sold out in less than an hour. They've added another date at Wembley. More than 60,000 people downloaded a freebie of a new track when it was made available a couple of weeks ago.</p> <p>That new track, 'Crawl', kicks off the set with a vibrant growl, taking Kings of Leon's trademark jitter-rock down to a sullen brood. There's a throwaway line in it about 'a crucified USA' - the jumping-off point for a limp theory that Only By The Night might be Kings of Leon's 'political' album. The notion that the Kings notice much about the world beyond the end of their members is amusing, given the content of their three albums thus far. Albums one and two were all about girls and hard partying. Album three covered girls, partying, heartbreak and (on 'Knocked Up') eloping with a bun in the oven. Politics? They aren't U2 - at least not yet.</p> <p>Indeed, there's little reference to the African HIV/Aids crisis in another standout new song, 'Sex on Fire'. As the title suggests, Kings of Leon haven't finished with their favourite subject quite yet. Perhaps it's down to little more than the title, but there are hints here of Bruce Springsteen's 'I'm On Fire', and of a leaning toward widescreen anthems. 'Manhattan', meanwhile, is equable and consolatory, sounding nothing like them - which is always a useful skill to have in reserve.</p> <p>As 'Charmer' - their Pixies tribute - swaps places with the deceptively upbeat jangle of 'Slow Nights, So Long', the show is unquestionably a success. But how is it that a band so unforthcoming onstage as Kings of Leon have arenas on their itinerary? How is it that a frontman as uncharismatic as Caleb Followill is so adored? Perhaps it is the way he picks up his water bottle to walk offstage, and then, stopping to wave at fans, pops it quite innocently between his legs, where it ceases to look like a water bottle, reminding everyone what their favourite band is all about.</p>",
  "<p>Tomorrow morning two convoys of luxury four-wheel-drive vehicles will speed from the leafy western suburbs of Islamabad on to the newly widened dual carriageway through the centre of the Pakistani capital. </p> <p>Barely braking for the police checkpoints, they will converge on the National Assembly. The two most powerful politicians in Pakistan - Nawaz Sharif, the head of the Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N), and Asif Ali Zardari, the husband and successor of assassinated Benazir Bhutto as leader of her Pakistan People's Party (PPP) - will either be burying President Pervez Musharraf or praising him. If negotiations to secure an 'honourable exit from power' for the military strongman have been successful, it will be the latter: speeches disingenuously praising his contribution over nine years of rule to the Pakistani people. If not, it will be impeachment. </p> <p>'Musharraf's days in power are numbered,' Ayaz Amir, a PML-N MP, said yesterday. Makhtoum Shahabuddin, a former PPP minister and recently re-elected MP, agreed: 'He is batting on a very, very sticky wicket.' </p> <p>What is certain is that the world will be watching the power struggle in Pakistan very closely indeed. For the apparently imminent political demise of the President of Pakistan, the head of a nuclear-capable Islamic state of 170 million people, will have repercussions well beyond the humid corridors of Islamabad. Last week violence flared up throughout Pakistan: suicide bombers struck in the east, hundreds died as the army launched new offensives against radical Muslim militants a hundred or so miles to the west, there were riots across the border in Indian Kashmir and bombs, and the customary rockets and battles in Afghanistan. </p> <p>'It is clear that we are on the brink of a major change that goes well beyond the end of another cycle of civilian-military rule in Pakistan,' said one Islamabad-based Western diplomat. </p> <p>Each of the main players in the drama - Sharif, Zardari and Musharraf - represents a broader trend in society, and each viscerally detests the other two. Whoever triumphs will set the nation's course for the future.</p> <p>The changes in Pakistan over the past decade are manifest. This weekend tens of millions will be following events on the country's scores of new local language television channels - predominantly Urdu, the national tongue, but in minority Sindhi, Punjabi and Pashto, too. None existed a decade ago. The vociferous and hugely popular talk shows have politicised swaths of the population. 'Once we could count on our name to get elected,' said Masroor Ahmed Jatoi, a candidate in the February election, who hails from a major landowning family in the southern Sindh province. 'But not any longer. People are demanding much more. They are much less deferential.'</p> <p>For those without televisions, the now ubiquitous 'one rupee a minute' mobile phones will act as a secondary conduit of information. In the growing cities - a recent study revealed that more than 50 per cent of Pakistanis now live in towns of more than 5,000 people - the effects of the long economic boom of the Musharraf years has broadened the middle classes. </p> <p>'The guys who had a bicycle now have a motorbike, those who had a motorbike have a car,' said one Karachi-based journalist. 'They worry about paying the rent, about losing their jobs, but they are better off none the less.' The symbol of these new classes is the tiny hatchback, the 800cc \u00a33,000 Suzuki Mehran, which pack the congested streets of the southern port city. If Britain's 'Mondeo Man' determined political fortunes in the early 1990s, Pakistan's 'Merhan Man' - and, in this still deeply traditional society, the drivers are almost always male - will determine how Pakistan goes forward.</p> <p>The irony is that Musharraf instigated the changes, such as the liberalisation of the media and the economy, that could lead to his downfall. </p> <p>The 65-year-old general took power nine years ago in a bloodless coup, ousting Prime Minister Sharif, a wealthy industrialist from the relatively prosperous eastern province of Punjab, who came to power when Benazir Bhutto's administration had been dismissed for incompetence and graft less than three years earlier. </p> <p>The summer of 1999 had seen a series of corruption scandals breaking around Sharif and his family, a short, vicious and disastrous war with India in Kashmir, and an economy in freefall. One by one Sharif and his cronies corrupted, co-opted, imprisoned, exiled or intimidated almost all who could act as constraints on their power: NGOs, the press, the judiciary, the religious establishment, the bureaucracy, Bhutto and her husband, Zardari. But when Sharif attempted to replace Musharraf, the head of Pakistan's immensely powerful military, he went too far. As the general circled in a passenger jet above Karachi, forbidden to land and running out of fuel, loyal army commanders moved swiftly to secure the country.</p> <p>'The Pakistani Army always has updated plans for a war in Kashmir, for an Indian invasion, and for taking control of government,' one retired senior officer said recently. 'We just dusted off the right file and it was over in hours.'</p> <p>Sharif was arrested, tried for treason and exiled to Saudi Arabia. He made no secret of his desire for vengeance. Eight years later it looks as if he will get it. According to sources close to the negotiations, it is Sharif who is insisting on the harshest conditions for Musharraf's potential exit this weekend. </p> <p>But revenge had to wait. The coup had broad domestic support and Musharraf found himself back in international favour after the 9/11 attacks when, after some deliberation, he pledged his support in the 'war on terror'. A flood of diplomatic, military and financial aid followed. And until spring last year, Musharraf, not least thanks to a booming economy, seemed unassailable.</p> <p>The threat to Musharraf came from two directions. The first was from the Islamic militants. Critics argue that the general is a 'closet Islamist', but this is unlikely: Musharraf is far from devout. In his first interview as President, he proudly showed The Observer his pet spaniels - causing fury among religious hardliners, who see pet dogs as un-Islamic. If he has manipulated militant groups, it is out of Realpolitik, not faith. </p> <p>Indeed Musharraf is broadly representative of many old-school Pakistani army officers - and of an earlier generation of the Pakistani middle classes heavily influenced by the culture, language and ideas of their British former colonial masters.</p> <p>The surge of militant violence during Musharraf's rule was partly a result of the fall-out from the war on terror globally, with Pakistan caught in the surge of radicalism that has seized much of the Islamic world, although sheer incompetence also played a large part. Demoralised soldiers or policemen were sent repeatedly against enemies they were ill-equipped to fight, in campaigns with little strategic direction or consistency. The assassination of Benazir Bhutto, shortly after her return to Pakistan after an agreement with Musharraf, was merely the most spectacular of hundreds of bombings, shootings and clashes in a struggle that is now becoming a full-scale war. In the past ten days nearly 500 people have died and 135,000 been displaced by fighting in the anarchic western borderlands.</p> <p>For Musharraf, the rising tide of violence was a double blow. Overseas, the President appeared incapable of fighting even Pakistani militants, let alone the Taliban or al-Qaeda, which had based itself in the country he supposedly governed. American officials asked themselves if he really was the right man to be receiving billions of dollars of aid. Domestically, the violence undermined the military's claim that only they, not a civilian government, could ensure security. Worse, it led to Musharraf being seen by everyone from peasants through to Mehran Man and Pakistan's intellectual elite as an American stooge who, in the words of one angry army officer, sent 'good Pakistani Muslims to fight Washington's wars against their own countrymen and co-religionists'. </p> <p>Here a second shift in Pakistan in recent years was important: the reassertion of a more confident and aggressive national and religious identity, which translates into a much less deferential attitude to the West. From the clerks or the pharmacists or the small businessmen who are convinced that Israel, India and America are joining arms against the Muslim world to the wealthy elite who would rather holiday in Dubai, Malaysia or Saudi Arabia than in Europe or America, a new sense of Pakistan's place in the world, and crucially among Islamic nations, has become clear. Language as well as faith is important, even among the English-speaking educated class. There is a new emphasis on local, not imported Anglophone, culture. 'For the first time, I am ashamed that my Urdu is not better,' said top music producer and former pop star Rohil Hayatt. </p> <p>The other threat to Musharraf came in the unlikely shape of Pakistan's white-shirted, black-suited lawyers. Their protest was sparked when the President moved to suspend the flamboyant Chief Justice last year - a big mistake. Protests spread to the universities as, for the first time, Pakistan's middle classes turned against the man they had once largely supported. The ringtone 'Go Musharraf Go' became one of the most popular in the country. A manipulated election in October, a state of emergency in November and a continuing crackdown on the media brought reinforcements from journalists and intellectuals. A new 'civil society' movement appeared for the first time for decades.</p> <p>'The lawyers set things going, but are not a political party, so could not reap the true rewards of their actions,' said Professor Rasul Baksh Rais, constitutional expert at the Lahore University for Management Science. For the moment, the two major Pakistani parties, the PPP and the PML-N, recognise the need for uniting against the common enemy. But, given the changes in Pakistan, it seems likely that Sharif will be the long-term winner. </p> <p>In the surprisingly free and fair general elections of February, his Muslim League, though split and unprepared, did well. Particularly in the crucial Punjab province, it is the portly parvenu Sharif who best reflects the new and evolving values and aspirations of tens of millions of his compatriots. 'He has his finger on the popular pulse and the common man likes him,' Khawaja Asif, a key aide, said. </p> <p>On one side, there was the moderate, secular, charming, Westernised Bhutto and now her urbane, slick widower; on the other, there is Sharif, whose English is hesitant, who likes folksy Punjabi cooking and ostentatious foreign watches, who is socially and religiously conservative without being extreme, who has more support in Riyadh than in Washington, who sees Dubai - not London - as a model of economic development, and whose identity fuses religion and a chauvinist nationalism. There seems little doubt who reflects better the changing identity of Pakistan. </p> <p>'The winner of this crisis will be the democratic process in this country,' said Professor Rais. 'The culture, values and institutions have yet to be defined and refined, but the democratic process will win.' And in a democracy the government reflects the culture, the attitude and the beliefs of the people. They may not be those the West hoped to see.</p> <h2>The fate of past presidents</h2> <p>Being the President of Pakistan has advantages - the sumptuous free lodgings, the helicopter, the power - and one major disadvantage: the slim chance of a gentle old age spent basking in the gratitude of those you have so selflessly served.</p> <p><strong>Iskander Mirza</strong><br>A military coup ended the rule of Pakistan's first President in 1958, shortly after he himself had declared martial law. He appointed Ayub Khan as the martial law administrator, in the process forfeiting his own political legitimacy. Sent into exile to London, he died a decade later. </p> <p><strong>Yahya Khan</strong><br>The Chief of the Army Staff was handed power by Ayub Khan in 1969, but was forced out of office after the disastrous 1971 war that brought defeat by India and the independence of Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan).</p> <p><strong>Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto</strong><br>Benazir's flamboyant father and leader of the Pakistan People's Party was in turn handed the reins of power by Yahya Khan. He ruled, latterly as Prime Minister after changing the constitution, for six years before being deposed by the army in 1977. He was hanged in Rawalpindi in April 1979, having been found guilty of the murder of a political opponent.</p> <p><strong>General Zia ul-Haq</strong><br>After 11 years in power, Zia, who led the coup against Bhutto, himself died in a mysterious air crash - along with several of his generals and the US ambassador, possibly caused by a grenade hidden in a crate of mangoes. For the next decade, Presidents came and went, according to the twists and turns of democratic Pakistani politics, becoming the subject of derision and contempt when ousted. </p> <p><strong>General Pervez Musharraf</strong><br>In 1999 the current President seized power. He is hoping to spend a quiet retirement on his ranch in the hills behind Islamabad, saying he has no money to quit the country. The fate of his various predecessors cannot be encouraging.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday August 24 2008</strong></p> <p> We said that if Labour loses the Glenrothes by-election '[Gordon] Brown will be the party's only MP in Fife, where not long ago it boasted all four.' But North-East Fife, the seat held by former Liberal Democrat leader Menzies Campbell, has never been held by Labour and was previously held by the Conservatives.</p> <p> </p> <p>When Gordon Brown arrives tomorrow at Burntisland Parish Church in Fife he will join one of the most poignant gatherings of the Scottish political clans for several years. Politics will be suspended as dozens of Labour MPs and ministers, MSPs and councillors file into the striking post-Reformation church on the banks of the Forth estuary to bid farewell to the late Labour member for Glenrothes, John MacDougall. </p> <p>Alongside Brown, many others who have dominated Scottish politics in recent times are expected, including Sir Menzies Campbell, the former Liberal Democrat leader and MP for the neighbouring seat of Fife North East, and Henry McLeish, the former Labour First Minister.</p> <p>Mingling with the old guard, however, will be representatives of the newer, brasher and ever more assertive force in Scottish politics. Angus Robertson, youthful leader of the Scottish National Party at Westminster and the party's chairman, will attend as will Tricia Marwick, who stole the Scottish Parliament seat of Central Fife for the SNP from Labour last year in what many Scots saw as another sure sign of things to come.</p> <p>Since MacDougall, a popular MP and former leader of Fife Council, lost his lengthy battle against cancer last week, no one in Fife has dared talk publicly about the momentous effects his death could have on politics north - and south - of the border. But no one is any doubt as to what they could be. The Glenrothes constituency now up for grabs borders Brown's own Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath seat. This corner of Fife is the Prime Minister's own political fortress, his power base north of the border.</p> <p>For generations Fife, with its mines, docks and strong agricultural base, was solid Labour. But last year the resurgent Nationalists, in league with the Liberal Democrats, took over joint control of Fife council from Labour. 'Brown's council run by the Nats,' said one nationalist. 'Imagine it.' With Marwick also installed as the local MSP, the SNP has been highly active locally and firmly dug in for months. </p> <p>If, in October or November, it goes on to take Glenrothes, a Scottish new town which has always been staunchly Labour, Brown will be the party's only MP in Fife, where not long ago it boasted all four. 'That is the likely outcome: Brown surrounded,' said a party member.</p> <p>Hours after MacDougall died, the SNP - buoyant after its stunning success last month in Glasgow East - was instantly installed as the bookies' hot favourite. One Labour official observed that McDougall's passing was not just a 'personal tragedy' but also a 'political disaster'. By that he meant that defeat in the Glenrothes contest could well mark the end of Gordon Brown's premiership and throw Labour into yet more leadership turmoil that would let the Tories in.</p> <p>For the SNP, however, the battle of Glenrothes will be about far more than the fate of Gordon Brown. The party has momentum and senses that its big chance to change history is arriving. </p> <p>To Angus Roberston it is clear what is happening, not just in Fife but across Scotland. 'You are seeing the tectonic plates of Scottish politics shift fundamentally,' he says. 'The profound changes in Scotland over the last year prove that Scotland is heading in the direction of independence.' The polls confirm the mood. The SNP opened up a record 19 per cent lead over Labour in one this week. For its part, Labour seems shot through with fear about the SNP, and uncertainty - not least about who will stand for the seat. One of the possible Labour candidates said that many in the party felt 'tired and hurt that local people had turned against them' and switched allegiance to the Nationalists. She was not certain whether she would put herself forward to face everything the slick SNP machine could throw at her. Another possible candidate, Alex Rowley, a councillor and friend of Brown (and known by some as 'Gordon Brown's representative on earth'), is said to be out of the running, mainly because his closeness to the Prime Minister is regarded as an electoral liability.</p> <p>McLeish, who had to quit as First Minister in a scandal over office expenses, is being touted by some, partly because he is a 'name' but more, it seems, because he has been appointed to sit on various policy commissions by Alex Salmond, the SNP leader, and is seen as a 'virtual Nat' who could defuse the real SNP threat. </p> <p>Equally difficult for Labour in Glenrothes is the simple question of 'Gordon Brown: will he turn up or won't he?' Having cited the convention that Prime Ministers do not take part in byelections as his reason for staying away from the recent contests in Crewe and Nantwich and Glasgow East, the Prime Minister is in a difficult position. 'He is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't,' said a Nationalist official. 'If he turns up, it's a panic U-turn. If he doesn't he's running scared in his own backyard and doesn't want to be associated with failure.'</p> <p>The brutal truth is that it is the Nationalists who have the wind in their sails. They are raring to go and now have another platform from which to shout about policies that have proved genuinely popular since they took over at Holyrood last year - such as scrapping road tolls on the Forth and Tay road bridges and freezing council tax.</p> <p>Robertson is proud of what he says is his party's relentlessly positive 'healthier, wealthier, fairer, greener,' campaign message since it gained 20 seats in the 2007 elections and became the largest party in the Scottish Parliament. 'The transition from opposition to government was very well worked through,' he says. </p> <p>When Robertson joined the party in 1985 the SNP was at 11 per cent in the polls and had two MPs. Last week a YouGov poll commissioned by the Nationalists put it on 36 per cent in terms of Westminster voting intentions, with Labour on 29. If replicated at a general election the SNP says this would give it around 26 MPs, exceeding Salmond's target of 20. The current total of SNP MPs is seven.</p> <p>Robertson insists the groundswell of support 'is in large part down to the growing confidence of people in Scotland who are no longer prepared to accept the limited horizons of the Labour party and Westminster government, while watching Scotland governed by a party that delivers on its promises,' he says. He 'truly believes' the SNP is now powering towards its ultimate goal of a referendum on independence in 2010. 'The hopes of Scottish Labour that devolution would \"kill the SNP stone dead\" have been proved false,' he says.</p> <p>Most alarmingly for Labour is that it is not just the SNP that is blowing this particular trumpet. Chris Parr, the politically non-aligned chief executive of Tullis Russell Paper Mill, one of the biggest employers in the Glenrothes constituency, has been hugely impressed by the way the SNP government has supported local industry in recent months. Recently the party helped secure a \u00a3100m biomass power plant in Glenrothes that he says will safeguard hundreds of jobs at his company. And the SNP has rekindled interest in Scottish politics in a way he had not expected.</p> <p>'I have to say they have been very impressive in the way they have supported industry and manufacturing,' he said. 'A lot of people have been very pleasantly surprised. It is the talk of the Scottish dinner party circuit.'</p>",
  "<p>Every morning Paul Convery walks out of his front door to be confronted by piles of discarded coffee cups and sandwich wrappings. There is an unmistakable stench of urine. The pavements are filled with stocky, intimidating men with glowering expressions and the parking spaces have all been taken by battered 4x4s that have not paid or displayed.</p> <p>'The neighbours down the road are woken nightly at around 3am by the sounds of taxi doors slamming, shuffling of feet, shouting and excitement,' he says. But this is no unexplained urban menace: this is the modern paparazzi at work. Convery has the misfortune to live on the same north London street as Peaches Geldof, the ubiquitous celebrity poppet whose picture is much in demand from tabloid newspapers and glossy magazines.</p> <p>'We have had up to a dozen paparazzi hanging out for 12 to 18 hours at a stretch, eating, drinking, urinating on the street, having barbecues,' says Convery, a local Labour councillor who was recently moved to write a letter to Geldof suggesting she 'slope off for a few weeks' to give residents a holiday. 'These guys are like professional wrestlers who have picked up a camera. They have access to a range of expletives that they use with ease. They are very aggressive and remind me of the hard men you would try to avoid at a bar. These are people who have had the empathy sucked out of their life systems.'</p> <p>This summer the British paparazzi have gone into overdrive. First, Geldof was alleged to have collapsed at home in July from a rumoured drugs overdose - which she denies - causing a spike of interest and a rash of tabloid photographs. That was further exacerbated last week by her marriage in Las Vegas, aged 19, to an unknown American rocker: cue front-page pictures of Geldof sporting an oversized wedding ring, looking sheepish. Then there have been the constant snatched images of Amy Winehouse shuttling to and from rehab and the blurry shots of Sienna Miller wrapped around a new boyfriend.</p> <p>The pursuit has been relentless. Miller, who has been dating the married actor Balthazar Getty, broke down in tears at a Los Angeles garage on Monday when photographers swarmed round her car and asked questions about her alleged 'home-wrecking'. She later complained to police and was given an escort back to her Beverly Hills hotel.</p> <p>Last week the actress Keira Knightley complained that paparazzi intrusion was 'a very predatory force'. 'When you are leaving your front door and paparazzi, who are a lot bigger than you, are shouting \"You're a whore\" to try to make you cry - that obviously is not great,' she said in an interview with Tatler magazine. 'If you look at the biggest film stars, they do not get paparazzi'ed that much, partly because they've already had it so much that they just close themselves off in their houses and don't leave them.'</p> <p>After the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in a Paris car chase in 1997, there was a collective pause for breath by newspaper and magazine editors who pledged not to use snatched images. But now, 11 years later, the fragile boundary between feeding the public interest and maintaining an individual's right to privacy appears to have been breached by a new breed of guerrilla paparazzi.</p> <p>The market has taken a disquieting turn. Our ghoulish fascination with images depicting stars in various states of disintegration has ensured that these pictures often carry a higher monetary value. Just think of Winehouse, chalk-faced and bleary-eyed, pictured wandering the streets in her underwear last December. Or Britney Spears, who was photographed strapped to a hospital stretcher in January after tearfully refusing to hand over custody of her children. Both images would have sold for thousands of pounds.</p> <p>'I don't know a single agency photographer who would shout that kind of insult [to Keira Knightley], and the agency wouldn't employ them if they did,' says one showbiz photographer who declined to be named. 'The problem is you're getting more and more freelance guys who think they can make a quick buck just by buying a camera and pitching up on a doorstep. They can be quite aggressive and focused. They're like hunters following prey, because the game has got much more competitive and that encourages a kind of survival of the fittest.'</p> <p>Almost anyone can be a paparazzo now - all that is required is a digital camera, sharp eyes and a satnav that can direct you to Sadie Frost's house in Primrose Hill. Bystanders can take snaps of celebrities on their mobile phones and sell them to gossip websites within minutes. Heat magazine alone receives 10,000 to 20,000 electronic images every day from readers.</p> <p>Why do we find paparazzi images so fascinating? 'I think it's because it's easily digestible entertainment,' says Perez Hilton, the influential American celebrity blogger. 'It's fun escapism.' A full-size picture of the most bankable celebrities - Kate Moss, Kylie Minogue, Knightley or Miller - can fetch \u00a3200. But the value of the shot depends on the story behind it: an exclusive set of Winehouse leaving a rehab clinic, for instance, can be worth up to \u00a330,000.</p> <p>'Female celebrities always sell better than men because the magazine readership is overwhelmingly female,' says Alex Stanger, an entertainment reporter for BBC News 24. 'Women want to see other women not looking so great. A shot of someone's armpit hair or cellulite sells more than a lovely, set-up, airbrushed photo.'</p> <p>The increasingly fevered competition means that a dedicated paparazzo must stick like glue to his target. This has led to a surge in the number of car chases - or 'follows', in paparazzi-speak. Not for nothing has the new generation of showbiz photographers become known as 'the stalkerazzi'. John Mayer, the singer-songwriter ex-boyfriend of Jennifer Aniston, complained earlier this month that photographers were routinely breaking the speed limit and shooting red lights.</p> <p>In fashionable areas, the joke goes that you are never more than six feet away from a paparazzo. In Los Angeles the city council is considering a so-called 'Britney law' that would seek to license paparazzi and introduce regulatory measures such as making them have a fluorescent 'P' on their number plates. Elsewhere, a group of Malibu locals attacked paparazzi who were trying to take shots of the actor Matthew McConaughey surfing.</p> <p>'Celebrities are constantly being hounded now because the market is so saturated,' says Stanger. 'I interviewed George Clooney recently and he said to me that he has to be so much more aware than he was five years ago because now he goes to a restaurant and he won't know whether the nice couple next to him will start filming him on their camera phones. That means it is getting a bit more vicious.</p> <p>'But it's a two-way street: celebrities need paparazzi as much as the paparazzi need them, and some of them will have a relationship with certain photographers. Victoria Beckham was always rumoured to have a guy she would call up to say: \"I'm going to the petrol station at this time, take a photo of me then.\"</p> <p>'It's a weird, double-edged relationship. Amy Winehouse makes tea for her paparazzi and Britney Spears ended up going out with one [Adnan Ghalib], so it's almost like they're the only friends they have left. It's quite incestuous.'</p> <p>Admittedly certain celebrities at the lower end of the fame spectrum rely on paparazzi shots to raise their profile. Others, like Kylie Minogue, agree to stop and smile on the proviso that they are then left alone. If the famous do not seek attention, so the argument goes, it is easy to avoid.</p> <p>'If they don't like it, they can just move,' says Perez Hilton. 'Julia Roberts moved to New Mexico. Sandra Bullock moved to Texas. There's nothing worse than celebrities who complain or hide their faces for pictures. So long as the paparazzi aren't breaking the law, celebs just need to put up with it.'</p> <p>Certainly it would be unfair to assume that the paparazzi are operating in a vacuum. They are simply feeding the demand, both from the public and from the celebrities themselves. There is, too, a certain code of honour among agency photographers, who react with horror if you label them with the 'p'-word.</p> <p>'I would say very strongly that our organisation would not condone anyone making a celebrity cry,' says Alan Williams, chief executive of Big Pictures. 'I'm not saying those photographers don't exist, just that they're not employed by our agency.'</p> <p>That offers scant comfort for celebrities who feel hounded. Nor does it give much succour to the likes of the unfortunate Paul Convery, who is not a celebrity and has never sought to be. As he continues to battle his way through the disposable barbecues, one can only hope that Peaches doesn't do anything too newsworthy in the weeks to come. Perhaps, as Perez Hilton suggests, she should move to New Mexico. Then, at least, the residents of his street would get their parking spaces back.</p> <h2>What it's like for the neighbours</h2> <p>Living virtually next door to Amy Winehouse is no easy ride. It's not so much the antics of Amy herself that keep her neighbours up at night, but rather those of the small army of hangers-on and paparazzi milling around at all hours. </p> <p>Though she is hardly ever around, Amy-watching is a 24-hour-a-day industry, with the end of the road always blocked with cars and scooters, while taxis and deliveries arrive at all hours, causing the street to be lit up with flashes.</p> <p>Bored with hanging around all day and night, 3am games of football among paparazzi using parked cars as goalposts are not uncommon. </p> <p>That said, there are some notable advantages to having a celebrity neighbour. House prices aside, the presence of a dozen photographers and a pair of burly security guards keeping a 24-hour vigil helps make the street one of the safest and most crime-free in the whole of north London. </p> <p>Even if it is mostly through a siege mentality, her presence encourages conversation between neighbours and even promotes a small sense of community not seen in many places in the city. </p> <p>Plus, being one step ahead of the gossip columns definitely impresses friends and colleagues, with most being at least a little curious or even jealous.<br><strong>David Hewitt</strong></p>",
  "<p>Andrew Herrington, a retired Birmingham lorry driver who now lives in Thailand, lowered his voice and turned to his companions: 'Well, you know, he married a bar girl. What did he expect?'</p> <p>Sitting on the ground floor of his home - a two-storey house squatting in a rice paddy in Isan, north-east Thailand - Herrington, aged 51, was talking about his friend and neighbour, Ian Beeston, who was found murdered last weekend after predicting that his Thai wife would kill him.</p> <p>Beeston, 69, a retired design engineer, had been beaten and stabbed in his house - police say he took seven hours to die. His wife, Wacheerawan, 42, and her Thai lover, Somchit Janong, 48, confessed and have been charged with murder. In bizarre and macabre fashion, Janong even re-enacted for police and photographers the manner in which he had clubbed Beeston to death.</p> <p>This was no isolated romance that culminated in a tragedy. The British embassy in Bangkok processes the wedding documents of up to 70 couples each week. The requests are almost exclusively from older British men - among 860,000 UK tourists each year - hoping to marry younger Thai women. But for any British man hoping to follow in Beeston's footsteps and build a new better life in Thailand, his death was a stark reminder of how badly things can go wrong. </p> <p>Three of the group of worried farangs - the Thai term for foreigners - who had gathered in Isan, have invested a hefty chunk of their life's savings building houses nearby on the fringes of Suwannaphum village, deep in Thailand's poorest province, Roi Et. Beeston's house, which swallowed up all of his \u00a3250,000 retirement nest egg, was described locally as 'palatial'. Unsurprisingly, in the wake of the killing, a siege mentality has taken hold. </p> <p>'Wanna' was indeed a bar girl, a prostitute. She met Beeston in a bar in Beach Road, Soi 2, in Pattaya, the garish beach resort in southern Thailand, when he was still coming to the country on holiday. The resort is notorious for go-go and hostess bars with a 'sin city' reputation that surpasses that of Bangkok. Eventually, his marriage having fallen apart, Beeston took early retirement from his job at the Ford motor plant in Dagenham, Essex, and moved to Thailand. In 1999 he married Wanna and paid for her two grown-up children to be put through university.</p> <p>The good life hit the buffers when he discovered Wanna had secretly sold his Suwannaphum property. As foreigners are barred from owning land in Thailand, he had put everything in her name. All his savings from working as a design engineer, first at Perkins and then at Ford, had gone. Worse, the new owners of his house were agitating to move in. Four months ago a furious Beeston banished Wanna to a corrugated shack in the back garden. Friends feared then that he had signed his own death warrant.</p> <p>In a letter left with lawyers, Beeston predicted his own grisly fate. 'It is just a matter of time now,' he wrote. 'I am in real fear for my own life.'</p> <p>Beeston's romance, like so many others involving Western men escaping loneliness at home, began with a stroll down one of the hundreds of neon-lit strips in Thailand's tourist-friendly sex quarters. The ratio of male tourists to Thai women is almost two to one. Walk down Bangkok's Soi Cowboy or Patpong any evening and it is easy to see how masculine fantasy can take flight. Ageing, unprepossessing foreign men are fawned over by lithe young Thai women wearing broad smiles and revealing clothes. The prospective clients are beckoned through curtained doorways to a dimly lit world where bar girls dance suggestively on a tiny stage and strip.</p> <p>Others chat up the punters in rudimentary English. The price of all this attention is just the cost of a drink for the girl, perhaps a tip. The often unspoken element is that the girl will go back and spend the night at his hotel. Cash is rarely mentioned, and there is no unseemly haggling, but the going rate is little more than a 'present' of \u00a320.</p> <p>'[The men] are often not the most handsome of all, they are usually in the latter years of their life, they are bald, unattractive and quite lonely in their own little society,' writes Thai anthropologist Dr Yos Santasombat in Hello My Big Big Honey!, an anthology of love letters penned to Bangkok bar girls. 'When they come to Patpong, they're struck with girls who are all over them.'</p> <p>The appeal of easy, cheap sex is evident the next morning. The same men hold hands with their bar girls skipping down the pavements of Bangkok's tourist haunts. 'Often they extend their relationship for a number of days or weeks or even years,' writes Yos. 'Sometimes the farang himself ends up spending the entire vacation with one girl and sometimes comes back. Sometimes she becomes his mistress or even a wife.'</p> <p>Romance with a Westerner in such circumstances can come perilously close to a game of mutual exploitation. Nearly all of the girls have flocked to the cities and resorts to escape their own prison: an impoverished existence in Thailand's rural expanses, whereas a night's takings from the city bar could sustain a family for a month. From Isan's desperately poor, rice farming villages, where hunger is the norm, the bars of Bangkok or Pattaya are a welcome escape. For girls with little education they provide an opportunity to shine and have the honour of providing for their families by sending new-found riches back home.</p> <p>'They do it because it's an easy life,' said John Burdett, a British lawyer-turned-novelist who has interviewed hundreds of bar girls for books such as Bangkok Haunts. 'You don't want to be a subsistence rice farmer. It's very, very hard. Village life's claustrophobic. Bar girl work isn't dirty. It's not strenuous. They don't have dozens of partners; maybe one or two a week. The rest of the time they're getting men to buy drinks and existing on tips. In the village there's a kind of omert\u00e0, where no one talks about it. But they send money home to care for people, so they've big status.</p> <p>'A bar girl in her early or mid-twenties has a 10-year window of opportunity to get out of poverty,' said Burdett. 'So if she spends time with a guy she is using up her chances. She sees that as an investment and she's entitled to something in return. The car and the house may be in her name. In the West we've lost our intuitive understanding of how poverty shapes thinking. So, if after 10 years together the foreigner decides to move out, leaving her with little to show for it, that's a problem. She's lost face and that's terribly important. Her image has been damaged and it might even lead people to kill.'</p> <p>Stephen Treharne Jones, 63, was a former neighbour of Beeston. Jones met Lamyai, then 32, in a Pattaya bar and sought to 'rescue' her and send her home to Isan. 'When I met my wife, Lamyai , she had nothing,' said Jones. 'I paid her out of a sex bar in Pattaya and told her to go home. When I visited her home she was living in a room with her two children. There was no bathroom or toilet facilities, no doors, no tiles, no electricity, just a mattress and blankets on the floor. So I bought a big home for both of us and bought the land off her relatives.'</p> <p>Jones's world collapsed when he asked his wife to sell a piece of land he had bought. Lamyai refused, saying it was impossible. Only when he went with a lawyer to the land registry did he discover he never owned it. He bought it from Lamyai's family, but allowed them to keep it in their names because of foreign ownership prohibitions. When challenged, Lamyai threw him out of their luxury villa in Kalasin, an hour from Suwannaphum. Penniless, he scuttled back to King's Lynn, Norfolk, two months ago. He now lives there in sheltered accommodation.</p> <p>'Looking back now, I know my Thai wife had set me up from day one,' said Jones last week. 'In Kalasin I know of three other foreigners who were kicked out by their wives after they completed property purchases. They say there's no fool like an old fool. But I did genuinely love Lamyai. I was sold a dream, I guess. A quiet life in the country where food and drink was cheap, the women attentive and the weather warm. But that's not the reality. The reality is that one becomes a captive.' </p> <p>Lamyai has a very different account of the breakdown in relations. 'If Stephen had been a good husband I would not have asked him to leave,' she said. 'But when he argued he called me a thief and a prostitute. We were quite happy for four years, even though he spent a lot of time going out drinking with his farang friends in the area. Stephen had a house he could have lived in all his life if he respected me as his wife, but at the end I was just his servant.'</p> <p>As his own marriage became a bitter property dispute, Beeston saw trouble coming. Exiled to the garden shed, his wife had installed her lover, Janong, and they kept Beeston a virtual prisoner in his own home with taunts and attacks.</p> <p>In a letter to his lawyers, Beeston told how his wife had started a money lending business - lending his money - and had paid off local police so she could run an illegal lottery. 'My wife threatened me with a gun,' he said in the letter, detailing a series of attacks on his house involving 'stones, lumps of wood, fireworks and even a tin of paint'. The house was also frequently burgled, he said.</p> <p>Like so many Britons and other expatriates living in rural Thailand who are unable to converse in Thai, it appears Beeston may have been the unwitting victim of a sting his wife had been waiting for years to bring off. According to his friends, the whole town, even the police chief, knew but nobody said anything. 'I thought she loved me, but she only wanted my money after all,' Beeston had told his Australian neighbour, Bill Lamb. </p> <p>'He told me he thought his wife was about to kill him,' said Lamb. 'My feeling is that Ian had been paying for Wanna's daughters from a previous marriage to go to university. This year they both graduated. I just don't think he was needed any more. She had it all. To be honest - the life of a foreigner isn't worth much around here.'</p> <p>Back in Herrington's Suwannaphum house, fists were clenched as the group discussed a fitting revenge for the perpetrators of the callous act. The palpable sentiment was: 'It's them or us.' But the bitter consensus was also that after all the publicity had died down Beeston's wife would be granted bail and freed. 'She's got the money, and with money cases just get dropped,' said Herrington.</p> <p>Then the conversation turned to the future and who was 'next for the bullet'. They agree they know the identity of the marked man. He lives about 20 miles away and is having some major problems with his Thai wife. 'Yep,' they chorus, 'for sure.'</p>",
  "<p><strong>What she watched: </strong></p> <p><strong>Olympics,</strong> BBC1, BBC2, BBCi, bbc.co.uk</p> <p><strong>Maestro,</strong> BBC2</p> <p><strong>Who do you think you are?</strong> BBC1</p> <p>I have a theory about our spectacularly rubbish August weather, which is that a crack team of Chinese cloudbusters have sent rain all around the rest of the world in order to make sure that a few billion people stayed in to watch live ladies' archery heats. </p> <p>'Never seen rain like it!' said my mother on Wednesday morning, while we were both watching the rowing, albeit 12,000 miles apart. She lives in a part of New South Wales that has been drought-ridden for years, but despite the fact that it is her winter and our summer we currently have identical climatic conditions. </p> <p>But the Chinese really needn't have bothered. As one woman alone on a dusty hillside above the Murrumbidgee River, and her daughter, alone on a rain-lashed hill by the Sussex seaside, could both testify, for two weeks every four years the world has an insatiable appetite for stuff it couldn't really give a ping-pong about, simply because it's the greatest TV show on earth. My mother and I may have barely spoken for months but we were both scrambling for superlatives in our mutual admiration of Nicole Cooke and Rebecca Adlington. Isn't telly great? </p> <p>And while I can't speak of the ABC's coverage, the BBC's is brilliant. So it should be, one may say, but it could be a lot less brilliant and still be infinitely better than every other global broadcaster. Obviously I haven't seen every other global broadcaster's coverage, but... the American stuff will be both parochial and hysterical, the Russian stuff parochial and miserabilist, while the Italian coverage will be anchored by women in bikinis. </p> <p>Having said that, I could do with a tweak or two. The Observer's own Eddie Butler is a fine broadcaster but his sonorous voiceovers do occasionally call to mind Tom Baker in Little Britain, and his observation that 'If we're not uplifted by this, we're probably still missing what the Olympics can do' of injured British weightlifter Michaela Breeze's dogged determination to keep on keeping on was accompanied by the soppiest of strings. </p> <p>But we know there's quite enough extraordinary achievement going on without needing it to be packaged and sold to us with a soundtrack straight from Titanic. The great thing about sport is how we can suddenly and unexpectedly be moved, though rarely by what we're told to be moved by, and I fear that the spectacle of women's weightlifting is not quite uplifting enough, though Russia and Georgia's victorious shooters hugging on the podium probably is. </p> <p>Meanwhile Garry Richardson's exhaustingly upbeat interview technique with canoe slalom silver medallist David Florence was hilariously at odds with his subject's personality - cool and collected, as befits a would-be astronaut. Meanwhile Florence's family, who greeted his win with smiles, politely shaken hands and brisk maternal kisses rather than free-flowing tears of unbridled joy, made Richardson sound as if he'd OD'd on Red Bull with a helium chaser and was therefore more excited than everybody else in Beijing put together. Back in the studio, Gabby Logan was moved to describe it wryly as 'Reality TV', while Florence, on the sofa beside her, persuaded that stiff upper lip into something approaching a smile. </p> <p>But for every laboured descent into uncalled-for sentimentality, there is a revelation. I really didn't think I gave a ping-pong about table tennis until a beautifully made little featurette distilled both the essence of the sport and its importance to the Chinese into five riveting minutes. Did you know that the first American feet on Chinese soil post-revolution belonged to US table-tennis players? </p> <p>I'm not very fond of 'Team GB', or the use of 'medalled' as a verb, or a two-hander between, say, John Inverdale and Steve Redgrave, and I expect I'll never know what differentiates a Yngling from a Finn in the sailing, but this didn't much matter when I could at any time press the red button and check out the extraordinarily uplifting sight of the US men's swimming relay team. </p> <p>'And we'll just show you that again... ladies,' said Gabby generously as we cut to Michael Phelps and friends standing poolside, ripped and stripped of those unsexy swimming condoms, celebrating yet another victory in glorious slo-mo. Verily the Olympic spirit is a beautiful thing. </p> <p>I watched <strong>Maestro</strong> (BBC2) mostly because it was there, and not because I expected to be wildly entertained by a mixed bag of slebs learning to conduct, which just goes to show how wrong I can be because it was riveting. </p> <p>A lot of this was down to the casting, for it is only at the surrealist cocktail party of one's dreams/nightmares that Peter Snow struggles with his baton technique alongside Goldie and David Soul, with helpful hints from Bradley Walsh and Jane Asher... but once you'd got over the shock and shelved all your preconceptions (Snow ought to be good at it just because he sounds as though he should be, while Alex James would obviously be great simply because he used to be in Blur) then you couldn't drag yourself away from the gripping drama of it all, not even to check on the swimming. </p> <p>And I learned lots - not least what a conductor actually does. I mean, I understood the essence of it, obviously, but it's only when you hear an orchestra conducted very badly that you can appreciate why it is so difficult to do it well, and certainly the BBC Concert Orchestra has never sounded more crappily cacophonous than it did under the baton of Peter Snow, who proved to have the innate musicality of a weightlifter, albeit with much less rhythm, while Alex James's attempt at interpreting Bizet may have prompted a judge to comment that it was 'a rock 'n' roll Carmen', but they were just being polite. </p> <p>Aside from James, Sue Perkins, Katie Derham and Jane Asher all know their way round a score and cajoled ladylike performances from the orchestra, while Bradley Walsh's mentor described him, sweetly, as 'in the zone with the Prokofiev', and David Soul somehow got through it without kicking over cardboard boxes or crashing a car.</p> <p>But it was only with the final performance, when graffiti-artist-turned-drum'n'bassmaster-turned-actor-cum-all-round 21st century renaissance geezer Goldie took to the podium to give us his Grieg, that we saw why conducting is equal parts technique, performance and X factor. </p> <p>You straight away knew it was going to be good because Goldie looked so completely at home he may as well have been in front of the decks in a club. By the end, however, when his mentor punched the air and judge Sir Roger Norrington declared, 'this guy's a conductor... terrific stuff, total control', it had been a journey so thrilling I immediately had to watch it another half a dozen times. </p> <p>Goldie may not be able to read music but he has the blindingly obvious advantage of not only already being a composer of sophisticated soundscapes but also, via DJing, of being a conduit between music and its audience. Alex James may as well stick to cheese, while if the rather smug Jane Asher wins, I'll eat an entire cheesecake. </p> <p>Who knew August TV could be so uplifting? Shortly after recovering from Goldie I found myself sniffling sympathetically as Patsy Kensit delved into her late father's criminal background during the first in the new series of <strong>Who Do You Think You Are?</strong> (BBC1). James Kensit, a 1960s associate of both the Krays and the Richardsons, and therefore clearly a man of considerable diplomatic skills, was in and out of prison before Patsy was born. </p> <p>As she traced generation after generation of impoverished Kensits back to the Bethnal Green slums of the 19th century, becoming more tearful and less able to string an entire sentence together as she went ('it seems ludicrous that it would move me...'), one prayed for a bit of good news, or at least some closure. </p> <p>Thank god, then, for her great-great-great-great-grandfather, the Rev Thomas Mayne, a man of infinite charity and a very Protestant work ethic - clearly passed down to (Catholic) Patsy, who has worked pretty much non-stop since 1972. Mayne was gifted an honorary degree by Lambeth Palace for his charitable work, and after ministering to 65,000 souls in the poorest parish in London was promoted to a small one in rural Buckinghamshire, where in turn he was held in such high esteem he was buried in the chancel of his church - or 'right at the heart of the house of God' as the present vicar elegantly put it. </p> <p>While anybody would be proud to have a Thomas Mayne as a branch of their family tree, Ms Kensit was so obviously uplifted she looked ready to climb up and swing from him. Lovely telly, mercifully free of national anthems.</p>",
  "<p>It is clear, in the short term at least, what must happen in South Ossetia. Russia must honour its ceasefire agreement with Georgia. Russian troops must withdraw to positions they held before the current conflict erupted. Both sides must allow peacekeepers into the region and return to negotiations on the final status for the enclave. Georgia's attack on the separatists would be reversed, Russia's ostensible war aim would be achieved.</p> <p>Moscow's reluctance to follow such a course proves that its war aims were more ambitious: a fundamental change in the balance of power in Europe.</p> <p>It is easy to see why the Kremlin should want such a shift. At the end of the Cold War, it lost control of a vast economic-political bloc. It ceded territory to neighbouring states and saw a rival military alliance advance on its borders. Few states are easily reconciled to such a drastic shrinkage of global status.</p> <p>Although Britain knows the pain of losing an empire, the more common comparison is with Germany after the First World War - humiliated, plunged into an economic crisis, followed by the emergence of an authoritarian ruler pledging to restore national pride.</p> <p>Given the parallels, it is hardly surprising that many of Moscow's former satellites are nervous. They see Russia's intervention in South Ossetia as a blatant land grab. In the Kremlin's claim to be protecting the local population, they hear echoes of Hitler's professed concern for the well-being of Sudeten Germans before marching into Czechoslovakia.</p> <p>That interpretation is shared, in part, by Washington. The US has responded to the South Ossetian crisis with renewed determination to hem Russia in. Its method is to press ahead with plans to include Georgia and Ukraine in Nato and to deploy anti-ballistic-missile defence systems in Poland and the Czech Republic. When, in the past, Russia has complained about the 'son of Star Wars' system, the US has insisted it is meant to deter Iran. It now looks transparently like old-fashioned Cold War escalation.</p> <p>One crucial difference between the current East-West confrontation and the Cold War is that, this time, the economic ties binding the two sides are stronger. Russia needs access to Western markets; the West - and Europe in particular - needs Russian oil and gas. That creates an opportunity for the European Union, the world's largest single market, to play a moderating role, steering the conversation away from military grandstanding and towards economic negotiation.</p> <p>But there is another, more worrying factor distinguishing present hostilities from the Cold War enmity. Under Soviet rule, many Russians privately shared the West's view of their leaders as thugs. But the Russian intelligentsia that secretly admired democracy has been either crushed or co-opted by Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>Unlike the tired dogma of Marxist-Leninism, Mr Putin's brand of militarist nationalism enjoys genuine popular support.</p> <p>Such a country will not defer to Nato out of respect for its members' status as democracies. But it might be convinced of the wisdom of settling disputes through international institutions rather than military adventurism. Inevitably, that raises allegations of Western hypocrisy. In defence of its campaign in South Ossetia, Russia cites Western actions in Kosovo and Iraq. That is neat rhetoric from the Kremlin, but as justification for its assault on Georgia it is plainly cynical. Russia's claim to be 'keeping the peace' in South Ossetia is belied by its army's penetration into undisputed Georgian territory and by credible allegations that it is facilitating atrocities by anti-Georgian militias.</p> <p>Such aggression must not be rewarded. But Cold War-style brinkmanship will not make Russia's neighbours safer. It will only reinforce the Kremlin's view that small states are pawns in a strategic game. The best guarantee of security and peace in Europe since the end of the Cold War has been economic integration, achieved through the EU. It is Brussels, not Washington, that stands the best chance of persuading Moscow to change its ways.</p>",
  "<p>It was supposed to have been her moment of ascension. Carolina Kluft, the heptathlete with nine gold medals to her name, had abdicated the throne and Kelly Sotherton, the so-called 'princess', was supposed to take her place.</p> <p>But a hiccup in the high jump on the first day started the decline, and the Olympic and world championship bronze medallist rapidly unravelled, her body language that of a broken woman in a funk she could not shake. Unable to regain control, Sotherton finished in fifth place overall.</p> <p>Three personal bests, in the hurdles, the 200m and the 800m - plus a decent throw in the dreaded javelin - rescued her blushes, but with her long jump and shot put well below par, there was never a chance of a resurrection.</p> <p>A sixth-place finish in the high jump, in which she was unable to go above 1.83m, started the rot, with 14th place in the shot put to follow. By the time Sotherton lined up for the 200m, she looked desperate. While all around her rival athletes slapped their thighs and geed themselves on, Sotherton cast a lonely figure, fiddling with her shorts, sombre and seemingly defeated. A 200m time of 23.39sec took her into third place, but she spent Friday evening in tears and in tatters.</p> <p>Yesterday a poor 6.33m in the long jump took her back down to fifth, and despite a decent javelin and a good run in the 800m there was nothing left to hope for.</p> <p>Before Beijing, Sotherton had told the world that she wanted the gold medal. With the field wide open it was there for the taking. 'I'll be Queen bee,' she said, glowing. She believed it. Despite the kidney failure, the toe injury, the back and the foot injuries, the tear to the right thigh, another injury to the left thigh and not having competed in a heptathlon - 'all during the last 10 months' - Sotherton had high hopes.</p> <p>She had laughed at the British athletes too afraid to state their ambitions for fear of an imaginary jinx. 'I did a magazine interview recently and they said: \"Are you going to Beijing to win?\" I said: \"Yeah! I'm not going there to come second.\" They said I was the only athlete that said that. People just go: \"Nah, well I'll see what happens.\" Well I don't train for four years just to go there and see what happens, I'm going there to win.'</p> <p>But somehow, between then and the weekend at the Bird's Nest Stadium, belief and ability evaporated. In response Sotherton sealed herself off into a lonely, dark little world, refusing to speak to the press. Meanwhile her rivals grew stronger, the Ukrainians Natalia Dobrynska and Lyudmila Blonska eventually bagging gold and silver, while the American Hyleas Fountain took bronze.</p> <p>Attempting to explain what went wrong, Sotherton talked about a lack of pressure, her face red with tears. 'I didn't feel any pressure and that in turn didn't give me any nerves. I was just flat and deflated. I'm glad I managed to turn it round and put it a bit behind me. I just wish I'd done that earlier.'</p> <p>The performance - the collapse - made no sense, but then Sotherton has long been an enigma. 'I'm shy. But then I've got a big gob, so I don't know how you marry those two together.' The big gob is important to her. At last year's world championships in Osaka she criticised silver medallist Blonska who, in 2003, tested positive for steroids and is still allowed to compete following a two-year ban.</p> <p>Yesterday she again slated the Ukrainian. 'I'm not happy that she competed. We have rules in our country that we abide by. We don't bring anybody who cheated previously, so why should any other country? That needs to change. If she had won gold it would have been embarrassing. I will always reiterate it, the biggest penalty you should pay if you take drugs is not to compete at the Olympics. Simple.' </p> <p>Unlike the other lauded British multi-discipline athletes, Daley Thompson, Denise Lewis and Dean Macey, and despite her achievements, Sotherton's popularity has always been in question. Paula Radcliffe is described as the people's athlete, but it is Sotherton whose life experiences really resonate. Raised by a single mum, who is wheelchair bound after contracting lupus, an inflammatory disease, Sotherton worked as a debt collector for HSBC until the age of 25. By night she was a clubber. As a teenager she spent her Friday nights drinking in the park. 'Oh my god! 20/20 in the park!' she says of the popular spirit-based drink. 'Do you remember that? Saving up all week to buy it.' She beams, happy to have found an accomplice. You suspect she has few of those.</p> <p>'Athletes are so boring!' she sighs, 'All \"great, fantastic, blah, blah, blah\". I've been a normal person with a real job, I've learned the hard way and now I'm successful. If it all went wrong tomorrow and I needed to get a job, I could. I don't talk posh. I've got really crap grammar. I don't have a degree. I'm like any other person on the street, really. Except I'm an athlete, I live in a nice house, I've got my own car and I've got four cats.' </p> <p>One of Sotherton's great early soundbites was her confession of a love of fish and chips. Even in the build-up to Beijing she ate them. 'Oh, I love my chips. I take the batter off the fish, so it's not that bad. And then I put lots of salt and vinegar and tomato ketchup - you can't beat it! Yeah it might be 1500 calories, but I burn that off.'</p> <p>She typically bamboozles her interviewers, with ideas contrary and outrageous. Some she believes in, others, you suspect, have just caught her fancy. When previously asked about competing in the heptathlon at London 2012 she was whimsical, suggesting a switch to track cycling, kayaking or beach volleyball.</p> <p>The one constant in her mind is a role in sports politics. 'A lot of people think I'd be a good chief executive, chairman or performance director. I could take Dave Collins's job [UK Athletics performance director] after 2012! Only joking. But that's the way I want to go. </p> <p>'I'm passionate about my sport. I want to make changes and you can only do that at the top. Women are very sensible at making decisions. They're hard nuts. We need a woman at the top of our sport. Any athlete who came to me and moaned, and there's been a lot of that, well, I've been at every rung of the ladder...' She grows shy. 'I dunno,' she says. 'I'm probably talking crap.'</p> <p>Maybe, maybe not. Sotherton is already the athletes' representative in meetings with the sport's governing body. There may be hints and snipes about her popularity in the athletics world, but if something needs doing, her peers trust her to do it. 'If anyone's got a problem they say: \"Get Kel - she'll do it\".'</p> <p>She revels in being a woman, in every aspect. She talks about female athletes being sexed up, of a society resistant to a woman with something to say, and in the same breath suggests getting her kit off. 'The thing is, a man can say what he wants, but with a woman either she's got to be a sex object or she's moaning. I'm moaning or showing my arse off - or throwing a crap javelin. You can never win.' </p> <p>'I want to change things, that's why I'd like to get to the top of my sport. After an interview with Sport magazine where I was in a gold bikini, I said: \"Why am I doing this to get space in a magazine? You don't see male athletes doing it.\" They made me girl of the week. Girl of the week? I didn't know I was going to be that.' The double whammy of being a bikini girl and demoted to the back pages provokes a grimace.</p> <p>She is not afraid of getting her kit off though. 'Hot Kel' (an actual headline) was naked and sprayed gold for a photoshoot recently. </p> <p>'Well, I had a crop top and shorts on, but they'll probably airbrush it so I look naked. I probably would have done it anyway. I always say to my agent: \"When's Playboy coming in with the six figures?\" Susan Sarandon did it and she was 40-odd and she looked brilliant. I'd do that if it was tasteful. Because I'd like to have the pictures. You don't have this body all your life, do you? But then you should be able to do that kind of stuff and still be recognised as an athlete and not \"hot Kel\". That's if I am hot Kel, because, well, I don't think I am.'</p> <p>Yesterday night in Beijing Sotherton accepted the disappointment of finishing without a medal in a competition she should have bossed. With tears in her eyes she vowed to come back stronger. 'I can't quit now. If I'd have won gold or silver I'd have gone on to jumping, but now I'll give it another year. I want to at least win the world championships.' </p> <p>Sotherton said the competition had precipitated a change in her, for the better. 'I've left the Kelly Sotherton of old behind,' she said, explaining her spirited final kick in the 800m. The 'princess' tag will inevitably stick, but it is clear that there is new substance to the lady in waiting, a mettle that will, she hopes, one day deliver her the crown.</p>",
  "<p>The end-of-season showpiece for the counties was a triumph for the men of Essex. Defeated by Kent in the semi-finals of the Twenty20 three weeks ago, Essex won this Friends Provident Trophy final by five wickets and seven balls to spare. They were indebted to a superb innings of 70 from Grant Flower on another day when the southern Africans took the lead role in domestic affairs.</p> <p>This was a tense affair, keenly contested and devoid of fluent strokeplay. There was not too much for the neutral to get excited about - though it was good to see the stands allocated to Kent and Essex supporters full and vociferous. Though increasingly dwarfed by the promised razzmatazz of the international circuit, county cricket lives, albeit with a bewildering variety of accents.</p> <p>In Kent's modest total of 214 the main contributors were the two South Africans, Martin van Jaarsveld and Ryan McLaren. The most cultured innings came from Pakistan's Yasir Arafat, an impostor at number nine. The highest score by an Englishman in Kent's innings was Geraint Jones's 19 and the only one of his countrymen to better it was Alastair Cook with 33.</p> <p>Kent have, understandably, followed the money. Their team is designed for success in one-day cricket. Everyone except Robbie Joseph bats; most of them bowl. Their reward has been two finals - at Southampton in the Twenty20, though the presence of Azhar Mahmood and Justin Kemp (both ICL men) seems to have prevented them from further riches in the Champions League, and here at Lord's. </p> <p>You can't blame them for their strategy. It is the challenge of the administrators to ensure that a county's priorities are for the good of the game. And it is the challenge of the English-qualified players to stand up and stand out. </p> <p>Back in South Africa they may not lament the exodus of so many of their cricketers quite as much as we think. Van Jaarsveld's Test days are over. McLaren's ODI days are yet to come. 'But McLaren is a \"Kolpak\",' I hear you mumble. So was Paul Harris, South Africa's left-arm spinner. You can, it seems, be a reversible Kolpak nowadays.</p> <p>Essex offer more scope to those hunting for potential England players, though their best bowler was probably Pakistan's Danish Kaneria. Graham Napier caught the eye - with the ball rather than the bat. Like the officers of police forces around the country great trust is placed in the reliability of a speed gun. In which case Napier's contribution was interesting. </p> <p>Napier's fastest ball was 91mph. In his eight overs he averaged 88mph. And he was on target. Joe Denly was clean bowled. Van Jaarsveld appeared to be plumb lbw to his first ball to everyone except umpire George Sharp. Napier bowls with Darren Gough's trajectory and he emulated the young Gough's zest. Is Napier, who has played a couple of astounding one-day innings this summer, an inferior cricketer to Luke Wright? He is unlucky not to be in England's Champions Trophy 30.</p> <p>James Foster was polished behind the stumps, though there was grave doubt over whether Rob Key touched the ball when he was given out caught behind. Ravi Bopara was entrusted with the closing overs, which he bowled off four or five paces, and Cook completed a couple of pieces of fielding that would have been beyond him three years ago. There was an excellent, on-the-run catch to dismiss Van Jaarsveld and a fine boundary throw to send James Tredwell back to the pavilion without facing a ball.</p> <p>Essex's response to a meagre target was tentative. Mark Pettini dug in until he was stranded, lbw to Azhar Mahmood, who must have been keen to atone for a horrible shot in Kent's innings. Jason Gallian found the boundary three times before dragging a full-length ball from Mahmood on to his stumps. </p> <p>Cook set about his task diligently, employing his favoured shots: the pull and the cut. He was out playing one of his least favoured, a cover drive into the hands of Darren Stevens. Bopara seemed determined to play a risk-free innings, rather than a decisive one and never got going. But Flower did with a superbly paced innings, punctuated by brilliant running between the wickets. He received just enough support from Foster and Ryan ten Doeschate.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Howard will be here from a little after midnight.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>A little after midnight:</strong> And here I am.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>12.10am:</strong> The first minute-by-minute report I ever wrote at the home of minute-by-minute reports was the dead rubber in the group stages of Euro 2008 between a second string Portugal and the host-with-the-least Switzerland. \"The only way is up,\" I thought, a touch naively, as it turned out.</p> <p>Welcome to \"Up With a Partridge!\" It's a little after midnight in Farringdon, and a little after 7am in Beijing, where Paula Radcliffe is limbering up to get her thing on in the women's marathon. There's not a great deal of hyperbole surrounding our Paula this time, thanks partly to the success of the cyclists, sailors and swimmer(s) of Team GB! GB! GB!, who have already given us a Golden Saturday, and a not too shabby Friday, if memory serves. But there are big question marks over Radcliffe today, most notably because she's recovering from a stress fracture of the leg, which would seem to be an important factor in the success of any marathon runner. But fear not, we also have Mara Yamauchi to cheer on/patronise if things go snap for Paula.</p> <p>We start in Tiananmen Square in about ten minutes. Emails are always welcome.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>12.20am:</strong> Radcliffe has had just three to five weeks' training for this, and the main question being posed by the Paxman-she-ain't Hazel Irvine is \"How long with Radcliffe's race last today?\" The portents for the full 26 miles aren't good, it seems. On previous form, Radcliffe is three minutes faster than anyone else in this field, and she's talking up her form, jesting that she's \"the freshest in the race.\" But she's not fooling me.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>12.30am: </strong>The bookies, for what it's worth, have Radcliffe at about 5-1, \"with a run\", meaning they weren't even sure if she was going to go. But go she is: she's standing behind a thick blue ribbon with the rest of them at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>12.31am:</strong> And. They're. Off.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>12.34am:</strong> Here's the betting. Chunxiu Zhou 2/1; C Ndereba 3/1; P Radcliffe 5/1; G Wami 9/1; B Adere 10/1; G Bogomolova 16/1; R Tosa 16/1; Shujing Zhang 16/1; S J Kosgei 20/1; Xiaolin Zhu 20/1; D Kastor 25/1; M Yamauchi 25/1.</p> <p>Yamauchi is a Japan-based Briton, so we can get on her side. And Liz Yelling, whose a Britain-based Briton (200-1) has taken an early lead, as they approach the Temple of Heaven. Anyone back from the pub yet?</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>12.38am:</strong> This is going to be a tough commentary. Although <em>that's</em> going to help: one of the runners just ran head-first into the 1km marker post, which was positioned in the middle of the road. It wasn't Paula.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>12.40am:</strong> There are an extraordinary number of flag-wavers lining the streets of Beijing tonight. And a couple of brass bands. Meanwhile, the talk in the television commentary box is of an \"anti-gravitational treadmill\" which Brave Paula has been using in her recovery attempts. She's right near the front at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>12.43am:</strong> It's a slow pace apparently, a full minute slower already than world record pace as they approach the two-mile marker. One thirteenth of the way through. Hang on.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>12.45am:</strong> The variety of belly buttons on display here is staggering. Innies, outties, half-in, half out. Marily dos Santos, of Brazil, is wearing a kind of poncho thing, perhaps embarrassed of a disfigured belly button.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>12.49am: </strong>They're in a park. Paula included. Liz Yelling is out front still, althou... wait! An email! \"Consider this a solidarity email,\" writes my colleague Taimour Lay, who I know has done this kind of through-the-night shift himself, and lived. \"Entirely unrepresentative vox pop: I met a Chinese guy tonight in Tufnell Park who said the Olympics were $25bn too expensive, an insult to poverty-stricken Chinese, and London 2012 will be an awful, expensive failure. It really put in an Olympic spring in my step I can tell you. Made all our work worthwhile. See you in 7 hours when I assume you will be an ashen-faced, broken shell of a man.\" Is it wrong to admit that I'm ashen-faced already?</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>12.52am:</strong> Here's how ruthless night-time online journalists can be: \"That's quite a good thing to happen, that,\" says my colleague Gregg Roughley, as the American athlete Deena Kastor collapses in agony onto the Beijing street, her four years of preparation rendered useless, her dreams shattered, her life a misery. \"Good for minute-by-minute reporting.\" Indeed it is: the American athlete Deena Kastor has just collapsed in agony onto the Beijing street, I can delightfully report.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>12.55am:</strong> \"Something just popped,\" Kastor said, during that moment of agony. Blister? Balloon? Probably not. She's out of this race, with what could well be some kind of bone break. Back among the running, Liz Yelling still leads for GB! GB! GB! although the experts reckon she'll not be there come the end.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>1am:</strong> Scramble for the drinks station in Beijing, similar to the scrum I left at a friend's birthday party moments before coming here. A band named Bombay Monkey had just taken to the stage, and I've just won a bet by mentioning that.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>1.03am:</strong> Liz Yelling is still leading here. Or Beijing, rather. The pack is kind of stretching out a bit, but they lost three or four runners within the first mile or so, the Eric the Eel kind, presumably. Brave Paula is still a-nodding in about fifth or sixth.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>1.06am:</strong> They're currently running through a part of Beijing that I think they modelled on Gerrard Street, London. Liz Yelling is the fastest through 10km, in 38.10, which is very slow, I'm told.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>1.10am:</strong> They've now just jogged past the \"Building of the People\" which was, apparently, the headquarters of the Communist Party. A fire truck is leading, then a family saloon car, then a motorbike and then Mamorallo Tjoka, who has overtaken Team GB's Liz Yelling.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>1.12am:</strong> And another one bites the dust. Having just taken over the lead, Mamorallo Tjoka, of Lesotho, has just pulled up lame. Another 32 or so, and this is in the bag for Paula.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>1.16am:</strong> Hold on, Tjoka is back. She definitely grimaced, swerved off to the side of the track, clutched her foot, but now seems to have run it off and is back out front. Brave Paula is still looking comfortable in the leading pack of about 20, with a couple of straggling packs now sliding backwards.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>1.19am:</strong> An insight into what this is all about: \"Paula has just grabbed a sponge!\" says Steve Cram in the commentary box, and this is worthy of a super slo-mo replay as Brave Paula dabs first her hair, then her arms and then discards the sponge. It's a GB! GB! GB! one-two at the moment, as Yelling and Radcliffe lead the pack.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>1.22am:</strong> It's not just athletics today, and there are 34 gold medals up for grabs in Beijing, according to the Guardian's \"definitive\" guide to the Olympic Games, which makes it the busiest single day of competition. There's swimming, badminton, horsey things, arguing, shooting, table tennis, volleyball and all sorts.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>1.24am:</strong> A few umbrellas are up in Beijing, and there's water on the camera lens. That means rain. The field is gradually being strung out, although the leaders are still tightly-knit. They include Paula.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>1.26am:</strong> Mamorallo Tjoka is now definitely done. She's pulled up lame again, clutching her left calf, and although she's grabbed a bottle of water and attempted to continue, I know an injured marathon runner when I see one, and Mamorallo Tjoka is one.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>1.31am:</strong> Trip, tumble, graze, yelp! That's the last minute or so for Liz Yelling who has just tasted the taste of Beijing tarmac after getting caught up in the pack and wiping out, big time. Her back is all red and grazed and her running shorts are stained. She's up and running again, but that can't be good, in anyone's book.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>1.33am:</strong> I've got two emails. Count them. <em>Two</em>. The first is from the night editor, who wisely suggests I punctuate this dirge with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/16/olympics2008.paularadcliffe\">a link to an interview with Paula Radcliffe about her chances in the marathon</a>. Done. The second is from Geoff Gilbert, who says: \"If Usain Bolt ran the marathon, without slowing up any more than he does in the last bits of the 100m, seems to me he would run it in about an hour and seven minutes. Worth trying?\" Well, he's got the 200m later in the week, so let's not rule it out for 2012.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>1.35am</strong> Liz Yelling has shown her grazed back to the rest of the field as she takes to the lead again. Paula Radcliffe's stress fracture is bearing up nicely, it seems, as she's bobbing along in the main pack just behind.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>1.40am:</strong> Tim Chesnutt is in Canada, and has an email address, which is music to my ears: \"My gal Stacy is not only serious amateur marathoner, but a huge Paula fan,\" says Tim, who then confuses me by continuing: \"and is hard into training for the Ironman World Championships in Hawaii in another six weeks or so.\" Is that what they call it? The Ironman? For women? That is political correctness gone, etc., etc.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>1.43am:</strong> OK, this is kind of vile. The Chinese directors have got a new tool called \"super slo-mo\" and they're using it like a kid in control of a video camera's zoom, ie, too much and inappropriately. So it is, that there are images on my screen of rippling muscles pulsating, bulging and oozing. It's not nice.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>1.46am:</strong> No Paula! No! Brave Paula suddenly disappears from the leading pack and drifts off the course to the side of the road. Why? No one knows, although she does have previous with those unscheduled bathroom breaks. By the time the camera picks her up again, she's making her way back onto the road and is catching up again now.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>1.53am:</strong> The Japanese runner Reiko Tosa, a favourite for this, apparently, is not looking too clever. In fact, she's practically in tears with some injury or another, her dreams dying step by step. \"That Japanese woman really needs to stop running now,\" sympathises Rebecca Strickson. \"It's not big and it's not clever.\"</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>1.55am:</strong> Constantina Tomescu, of Romania, has had enough of this dawdling, and has taken the lead by herself. She's a good 100 yards ahead of everyone else now, with Brave Paula leading the chasing pack. They seem perfectly content to let Tomescu go it alone.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>2.00am:</strong> Is a \"pit stop\" a euphemism for having a wee?\" asks Helen Burrows, who I think knows the answer to that, especially as she's referring to Team GB's weak bladder Paula Radcliffe and that brief diversion a few kms ago. \"The BBC are being surprisingly coy. Hurrah for internet coverage, though, as I can watch this in bed!\" continues Helen, which has also confused me. Do people have computers at the end of their bed these days instead of TVs?</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>2.01am:</strong> We're through 25k now, and the Romanian Tomescu is streets ahead, but looks like she might be regretting it. Brave Paula is leading the following pack. Meanwhile, Reiko Tosa is practically dead but still running. \"That's the Olympic spirit right there,\" says Gregg Roughley.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>2.05am:</strong> Brave Paula is beginning to do that head-bobbing thing that always makes you think she's about to peg out, but which has often preceded gold medals. Tomescu now leads by 44 seconds as they pass Beijing University.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>2.10am:</strong> Bad news for Paula fans, I'm afraid. The pace has picked up a touch and Radcliffe is struggling to keep up. She's drifted to the back of the main pack, as four or five athletes try to make up ground on Tomescu.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>2.12am:</strong> And we reach our level: \"Monty Python did that infamous bit about pit stops in their \"incontinence marathon\" sketch, where the lead keeps changing every few seconds as runner after runner went off into the bushes for a wizz,\" nostalges Brian Gibson, who is from Canada, but is in a hostel in Cardiff at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>2.16am:</strong> Tomescu still leads by a significant distance -- 55-odd seconds -- and Radcliffe is still <em>just</em> clinging on in the chasing pack. Tomescu is definitely struggling, with Steve Cram predicting, and me agreeing, that the medallists are likely to come from that chasing group. I'll do my best to get a few names of those in the Radcliffe pack in a moment.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>2.22am:</strong> These are some of the athletes in the chasing pack, which is now drifting clear of Paula Radcliffe: NDEREBA Catherine, SIMON Lidia Elena, KOSGEI Salina, ZHOU Chunxiu, TIMOFEEVA Irina, KOMU Martha, and let's give a big Team GB! GB! GB! welcome to Mara Yamauchi, who is also up there. Yes, I've copy-pasted them, but it's the best I could do.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>2.28am:</strong> If Paula Radcliffe was to peel off her own skin and hand it to a child-murdering sadist in return for the safety of 34 orphans, she couldn't be more brave than what she's doing here, according to Brendan Foster and Steve Cram in the television commentary box, who have never ever seen anything braver, nor can conceive of anything braver than her finishing ninth or tenth in this race. She's now drifting way behind the leaders, who are busy winning the thing, but we wouldn't know about it at the moment, I'm afraid, because it's all about bravery today in Beijing.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>2.33am:</strong> Putting bravery aside for one moment, Tomescu is still way out in front, as they reach the two hour mark. The Chinese athletes Xiaolin Zhu and Chunxiu Zhou are also in the chasing pack, but they're allowing the Romanian to get a lead that may be unassailable. Mara Yamauchi, who's GB! GB! GB! through and through, is also in that group and I'm officially switching my allegiance. Brave Paula is done, I'm afraid.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>2.36am: </strong>Constantina Tomescu leads by more than a minute now, and is now being referred to as Constantina Tomescu Dita, having apparently had the time to get married and adopt another name since this race began.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>2.40am:</strong> Seven athletes remain in the 'chasing' group, although they're not getting anywhere near Tomescu Dita. The Romanian is now sniffing some kind of energy-boosting smelling salts/poppers kind of thing, and is ahead by far.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>2.42am:</strong> Five kilometres left and Tomescu Dita is about three of them ahead of the pack. Brave Paula is still struggling on, but is way out of medal contention. Mara Yamauchi remains in the pack of seven who are closest to Tomescu, but if I know marathons (and I don't) Tomescu has this wrapped up.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>2.44am:</strong> Non-marathon news: Great Britain's <strong>men's hockey</strong> team are 1-0 down to Canada in their latest group match.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>2.46am:</strong> <strong>The Olympic dream is over for Paula Radcliffe</strong>. She's now broken down on the Beijing road, stopped, walked, screamed out, cried, and inadvertently posed for all the photos you're going to see on your newspapers on Monday morning -- and no doubt on this website in a couple of minutes. She's started up again, but that was proper anguish from Brave Paula, whose stress fracture couldn't hold up to the demands of the marathon. A sorry sight.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>2.49am:</strong> Tomescu Dita is now in sight of the Bird's Nest Stadium, but is showing the strain. There's super slo-mo anguish etched onto her Romanian face and the pack is slowly catching. But only a mile to go. Come. On. Mara. Yamauchi. She has a chance of a bronze here, which we'll take.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>2.52am:</strong> Less than a mile left, and Tomescu Dita leads by a minute, from, in this order: Zhou, Zhu, Ndereba, Komu and Team GB! GB! GB!'s Mara Yamauchi.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>2.54am:</strong> The artist formerly known as Constantina Tomescu, who was temporarily known as Constantina Tomescu Dita, is now being referred to as Constantina Dita, the relevance of which I know not. But she's in the stadium now and looking nailed on for gold. Mara Yamauchi has slipped back and is now battling for sixth place which, remarkably, would still be the best performance by a British woman in an Olympic marathon.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>2.56am:</strong> A huge cheer for Constantina Tomescu Dita, who comes bounding and waving into the Bird's Nest. She's running as ungracefully as any runner is likely to in this Olympics, but after 26 miles, who cares. There's an almighty battle going on for the silver between Ndereba and Zhou.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>3.00am:</strong> <strong>Constantina Tomescu Dita, of Romania, wins the women's marathon in 2:24.44.</strong> Catherine Ndereba, of Kenya, is second. Chunxiu Zhou, China, is third. Britain's Mara Yamauchi was sixth. Paula Radcliffe is still running at time of writing. Really.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>3.05am:</strong> Brave <strong>Paula Radclliffe</strong>, stress fracture and all, hobbles and limps into the Bird's Nest and finishes in, who knows what place. The official counters have stopped. She's in floods of tears as she's consoled by team-mate Liz Yelling and I'm going to stop this because the gushing commentary from Steve Cram and Brendan Foster is too much to bear.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>3.07am: </strong>Team GB are 1-1 in the hockey against Canada, although the feed has disappeared from my screen. And there's a reason for that: it's over. They drew 1-1.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>3.08am:</strong> \"I felt like I was just running on one leg,\" says a tearful Paula Radcliffe in her track-side interview.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>3.09am:</strong> \"This is not the end of the Paula Radcliffe story, please tell us that,\" pleads the BBC's trackside interviewer. Then: \"brave, blah, blah, brave, brave, blah, blah.\" \"Is this redemption for Athens?\" he then asks. \"Nah,\" says Paula.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>3.11am:</strong> \"That was a really brave and amazing effort.\" \"We knew her body might let her down today, but not her head or her heart.\"</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>3.13am:</strong> Liz Yelling, it seems, might have cracked a rib in her tumble in the marathon. More bravery from Team GB! GB! GB! \"They're bloodied, they're battered,\" says Hazel Irvine. Enough. Already. Enough.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>3.15am: </strong>Right, that's the women's marathon done and thank the lord for that. We're now back in the swimming pool, where there's not quite as much bravery, but hopefully a degree more sanity. It's the men's 1,500m freestyle, with Britain's David Davies going. Aussie Grant Hacket is the hot favourite.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>3.17am:</strong> Grant Hacket leads after 400m. Davies not in the top three at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>3.20am:</strong> \"David Davies is having to swim more. He's got smaller arms and a smaller stroke,\" says Andy Jameson, commentating on the swimming. Ryan Cochrane goes into the lead.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>3.23am:</strong> The Canadian Ryan Cochrane leads at the half-way point. Grant Hackett is second and Yuriy Prilukov third.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>3.25am:</strong> <strong>Swimming:</strong> The Tunisian Oussama Mellouli has swum himself into contention here and has gone ahead of both Cochrane and Hackett.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>3.27am:</strong> <strong>Swimming:</strong> Mellouli has gone for it from lane two. He's put the pedal to the metal in a swimming kind of way and has burst a good length or so ahead of Cochrane and Hackett with six lengths left. David Davies is fifth, sixth or seventh.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>3.29am:</strong> <strong>Swimming:</strong> Mellouli leads at the bell, which means two lengths left in swimming. Hackett is on his tail, but the Tunisian is ahead at the final turn. But...</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>3.30am:</strong> <strong>Swimming:</strong>Mellouli hangs on. Grant Hackett starts to come back at him in the final 50m, but the Tunisian keeps ahead and takes gold, his first medal. Hackett was going for his third consecutive gold in this event, but is beaten. Ryan Cochrane, of Canada, is third and GB's David Davies was sixth.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>3.33am:</strong> Just to whet your appetite for the coming hours: Michael Phelps goes for his eighth gold in the 4x100m medley relay and, put it this way, my colleagues are currently writing an article that begins: \"Michael Phelps won his eighth gold medal of the Beijing Games.\" In the velodrome, GB's all-conquering cyclists go in the team pursuit qualifying pretty soon. They're last on the track. (Currently France lead.) If you want to read about Paula Radcliffe and the marathon, click on that shiny hyperlink above.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>3.42am: Swimming:</strong> The German Britta Steffan wins gold in the women's 50m freestyle. It's her second gold of the Games, I think. The American pensioner* Dara Torres wins silver, and Sharon Davies tells me (not exclusively, she's on the telly), that Torres won her first medal in 1984.</p> <p><em>*Real age: 41</em></p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>3.48am:</strong> Hold on, what's this? Team GB! GB! GB!'s women's medley swimmers are in the final and doing mighty well after the first, back-stroke leg. Gemma Spofforth is second as she hands over to the breast-stroker.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>3.50am:</strong> The Aussies are cruising to victory, but the butterfly swimmer Jemma Lowe has brought Team GB! GB! GB! back into contention. Freestyle now.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>3.51am:</strong> <strong>Australia break the world record</strong> by about yesterday in the 4x100m medley relay. They're so far ahead of the moving green line that indicates world record pace that it's barely even on the screen. Team GB come in fourth, despite Spofforth's opening leg breaking the European record.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>3.54am: Swimming</strong> The British swimming women aren't happy with their fourth. In fact, they're crying. \"I'm <em>so</em> gutted,\" says Fran Halsall. \"Well, that's encouraging,\" says Hazel Irvine. They break the European record but feel they could have done better and that actually <em>is</em> kind of encouraging I suppose.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>3.58am: Cycling: </strong>Britain's team pursuit team are off, and looking comfortable in the qualifying round.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>3.59am: Cycling</strong> After 2km, the British cyclists are only just behind their own world record pace.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>4.01am: Cycling:</strong> The British team pursuit team qualify for the final. They're a full two seconds faster than their closest rivals, the New Zealand team, and look good for another velodrome gold. It's the third fastest ride over this distance of all time.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>4.07am: Swimming:</strong> Hazel Irvine knows how to set a scene: \"It's time for history to be made.\" She means Michael Phelps and she means the 4x100m medley relay in which the best advert for a good solid English fry-up is going for his eighth gold.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>4.09am: Swimming:</strong> Team GB! GB! GB! are also in this relay race, but even this proud jingoist has been swept away in the Phelps-ian myth-making. The USA lead after the first leg, but apparently it's by no means good enough and SHOCK! and HORROR! the Americans <em>might</em> not win this.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>4.10am: Swimming:</strong> Phelps takes over with America third. Third! Can you imagine?!?</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>4.12am: Swimming:</strong> Phelps takes over the lead for the United States, and Lezak has clear water in front of him for the freestyle leg. The Australian team challenge for a moment, but Phelps is not to be denied. Another World Record, incidentally, but this is all Michael Phelps. Gold. Gold. Gold. Gold. Gold. Gold. Gold. And...GOLD!</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>4.14am: Swimming: Team GB! GB! GB! finish sixth in the 4x100m relay. </strong></p> <p><em>USA win the gold medal and break the world record. Michael Phelps wins his eighth gold medal of the Games, breaks Mark Spitz's record of seven gold medals in a single Games, eats 912 eggs, 16 omelettes, 11 hamburgers and 14 pork chops, cures cancer, kills Lex Luther, and becomes the most winningest Olympian of all goddam time. </em></p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>4.20am:</strong> Back to reality: There's the women's beach volleyball quarter-finals on, there's Australia v Russia in the women's basketball, and there's a MBM reporter dashing off for a quick \"pit stop\" Paula Radcliffe-style.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>4.27am: Cycling:</strong> More wonderful velodrome-based Team GB greatness as Victoria Pendleton qualifies fastest in the women's individual sprint.

Basketball, beach volleyball?</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>4.38am:</strong> I know China are winning everything at these Games, but beach volleyball? Seems likely at the moment as the Chinese pair are thrashing the hapless Austrians (hardly a beach volleyball force themselves, admitedly) in the quarter finals.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>4.40pm:</strong> Amy Hordes wants basketball, but with Australia playing Russia in a women's preliminary group game, and what with it being 4.40am, I'm going to struggle to find the inspiration. It's 28-19 to Russia in the second quarter. \"Are the Germans or Swedes doing anything of note?\" Amy also wants to know and the answer is: \"Kind of.\" It's very very quiet at the Games at the moment, but Germany's Britta Steffen won her second gold in the swimming pool about an hour ago. Swedes? Shmedes.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>4.50am: Cycling:</strong> More Germany news: Stefan Nimke just set a new Olympic record during qualifying in the men's individual sprint. Britain's Chris Hoy and his elephantine thighs are out on the track again soon, so not sure how long that record will last.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>4.54am:</strong> Lo and behold, Chris Hoy breaks the Olympic record in the men's individual sprint set about 30 seconds ago. Safe to say he's the favourite for gold in the men's individual sprint. Jason Kenny, another British whirlwind, had previously broken Nimke's record. Meanwhile, Amy Hordes isn't satisfied with Michael Phelps: \"Is he scheduled to swim again today, or is it back to omelettes and mayonnaise?\" she asks. Phelps is done for this Olympics, Amy.

But, before the main course, an entree - it's Australia v Russia in the women's basketball.</p> <p>Aus 32-37 Rus in the third quarter. Stay tuned, folks.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>5.15am: Team GB sailing</strong> My official Guardian summary for today reads like this for the next couple of hours:</p> <p>5.00/12.00 \u2013 Ainslie, wind permitting (GOLD MEDAL)<br>6.30/13.30 \u2013 Yngling, wind permitting (GOLD MEDAL)</p> <p>So that's what's on the menu - and don't blame me if either don't come good. Ainslie should be out on the water, looking for a gentle breeze to blow him to victory, so I'll keep you posted.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>5.19am:</strong> It's also a big day for the Chinese - well, just another 24 hours in Beijing really - with the first Table Tennis gold up for the winning. Not even Forrest Gump is likely to stand in their way, but for now we're in bronze play-off territory.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>5.24am:</strong> \"Morning Alan,\" begins John Johnstone in such a charmingly convivial manner that I can hardly refuse him internet publication. \"Here in Canada I have been stuck with a swimming commentator who won't say Olympics.

Here's an anecdote about China's nascent love affair with bashing a ball back and forth over a net stuck in the sand:</p> <p>\"When the Chinese won the rights to hold the Summer Games, they decided beach volleyball was a sport worth pursuing. Next thing you know, there was a gaggle of Chinese athletes and coaches standing in the sand in Hermosa, wanting to learn the game. Several years later, the Chinese women are #2 and #4 (or so) ranked teams in the world. My role was teaching some of the athletes some excellent drinking games and introducing the guys to California girls. They seemed to like that. Their coaches not so much.\"</p> <p>Ah, John. For all your efforts, the Chinese are incorruptible. But thanks for trying.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>5.43am: Cruel mocking of a true British hero.</strong> John - whose thoughtful email has brightened my morning, and almost made up for the fact that nothing is happening in Beijing apart from USA chuckball, as well as my inablitiy to tpye anymroe - continues: \"I've seen Paula Radcliffe on television twice in my life, both times involved pain and tears.

Huzzahs!</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>5.55am:</strong> Al Parkes, a frequent contributor to our early morning talking shop, has a suggestion for John Clamberson: \"Maybe he shouldn't watch Paula if she hurts him and makes him cry.\" Al, I think John was expressing sympathy, without claiming to have suffered agonies of the soul.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>6.00am:</strong> However, if John, Al, or any of you do fancy exercising those tear ducts, you could do worse than flip yourself over to <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/17/radcliffe_curses_her_luck_agai.html\">Paul Kelso's blog</a> on champion nearly-woman Radders.

It could happen - if you Brits had qualified in them all. Oh, what is that, a passport age clarification? Well, there you go then, in all the finals [sly dig at wee British pup, Tom Daley, I think]. Re: Paula Radcliffe, she reminds me of my beloved All Blacks - all conquering in between the biggest contest on the planet (rugby World Cup, Olympics) but absolute pants when it comes to the big show.\" Enough of your cheek, Meek. How many medals have you islanders got, five?</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>6.58am:</strong> Andrew Jolly would \"like to second the Pommie B[*]sta[r]d from earlier on. The pile of vomit that Channel 7 have offered up as their 'coverage' of the Olympics makes Channel 9's coverage of cricket look like BBC's sport coverage during Des Lynam's prime. There are no times given for when anything is going to be on - 'later' is all we are told. Worst of their crimes against TV is that there are more replays than live sport, and even those are interspersed with ads every 10 minutes. I think the 100m last night was probably live, but it's difficult to know, as there is never any distinction given. I could go on.

However, Elena Dementieva and Dinara Safina have just trotted out for the final of the women's tennis. Lovely.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>7.05am: Team GB</strong> The umpire is a Brit! C'mon. The girls are warming up, but there's absolutely no one in the stadium to watch them. Apparently this has been rescheduled. Or maybe the Chinese couldn't care two figs about the women's tennis?</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>7.07am:</strong> The Russians are guaranteed gold and silver here, of course. Then Rafael 'Biceps' Nadal will take on Fernando Gonzalez afterwards in the men's final.</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>7.10am:</strong> The Beeb's commentary team is in a right old funk about the lack of spectators \"for this, an Olympic final\". The rearrangement has left the crowd completely wrong-footed.

The commentators up in the BBC studio are having a chuckle about the fella out on the water - the one braving pneumonia and a fate with the fishes to deliver a soundbite or two.</p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>7.34am:</strong> There's a lot of \"Olympic spirit\" being bandied about on the BBC couch. Liz Yelling has plenty, while Paula Radcliffe can barely run for the OS dripping from her shoulders. Or maybe from the fractured shin, I don't know. If <strong>Ben Ainslie's Finn race cannot be completed today, it will be tomorrow</strong>, so say the benevolent and watchful powers-that-be.</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>7.37am:</strong> Much discussion on how we can wangle it so that <strong>Team GB! GB! GB!</strong> (there, I did it) can top the medal table. Andrew Jolly is working on some kind of \"annual rainfall/days with no sunshine\" coefficient, while both he and Paul Meek reckon the Koreans might outstrip us in the medals per square kilometre stakes.</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>7.43am: News digest.</strong> Speaking of Korea, they are one game to the good against Japan in the women's Table Tennis bronze medal play-off. <strong>Team GB's Nick Dempsey has finished 17th in his RS:X (windsurfing to you and I) race, placing him fourth overall.

Apparently Dementieva has had a bit of a wobbly... not a happy devushku.</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>7.53am:</strong> Shock news from Aus, where most of this morning's correspondents seem to have been based. Andrew Collings is so disgusted with Channel 7's coverage that he has <strong>\"conceded the remote to allow the girlfriend to watch Will and Grace reruns for a bit\".</strong> Quel horreur!

The hurdler faced a barrage of questions in Athens after a startling improvement saw her come from being a virtual unknown to win gold. \"Why do people want to give a negative impression of sports?\" Halkia said then.</p> <p>Yes, why? You tell us, Fania.</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>8.46am: </strong> Andrew Jolly's alternative medals table debate continues. ''For the record, Switzerland won a gold medal in the men's doubles tennis and Trinidad came 2nd in the 100m last night.

''Can anyone do a Cold War medal table with the old USSR's medal totals combined? I'm too lazy but would like to know how the old empire is doing.

There's badminton, softball, tennis and hockey, too.</p> <!-- Block 188 --> <p><strong>11.40am: Gymnastics men's floor final </strong> Another gold for China. Zou Kai took it, Spain's Gervasio Deferr has the silver and Russia's Anton Golotsutskov the bronze.</p> <!-- Block 189 --> <p><strong>11.41am:</strong> Who on earth is this a description of? ''Her thighs are like Bavarian hams; I assume she has to talc them every half hour to stop them chaffing when she walks. Slightly incongruously, her top-half is marginally slenderer, and on top of her head she has a side-parted ginger bouffant.'' <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/17/bulgarias_national_hero_so_goo.html\">Read Andy Bull's latest blog to find out. </a></p> <!-- Block 190 --> <p><strong>11.40am: Two Danes in a dodgy boat</strong> Denmark won the 49er skiff sailing earlier today, but race officials say they cannot confirm the medal because they are handling three protests against the result. The mast on the Danes' boat broke shortly before the start and they rushed back to port to borrow a skiff from the Croatian team, which had failed to make the field of 10 boats for the race.</p> <p>If the Danes are disqualified, Spain's Iker Martinez and Xabier Fernandez, winners of the medal race, will retain the title they won in Athens fours years ago.</p> <!-- Block 191 --> <p><strong>11.54am: Cycling Team Pursuit</strong> Britain's men just annihilated Russia to make tomorrow's final against Denmark. <strong>It's a world record</strong> from Ed Clancy, Paul Manning, Geraint Thomas and Bradley Wiggins. Elite Performance Director Clive Woodward is beaming from the side because that victory was <strong>all</strong> about <em>visualisation</em> and rugby balls and motivational mantras and middle-class self-aggrandisation.</p> <!-- Block 192 --> <p><strong>12.01pm: Imperial Hangover Medals Table</strong> According to Andrew Jolly, ''the Soviet Union would only have 13 golds, and would be in 3rd. Depending on who you count as being in the British Empire, we could be up to 23 gold medals and 2nd place. We'd need to invade China to get anywhere...''</p> <!-- Block 193 --> <p><strong>12.06pm: Common English Usage</strong> ''When did medal become a verb?'' asks Michael Bryan in Brussels, who I guess is upset about language being in flux.</p> <!-- Block 194 --> <p><strong>12.10pm:</strong> Gary Naylor tells it like it should be: ''Andrew Jolly's suggestion that we invade China in order to top the medal table is plainly ridiculous. We should do what we did in the 19th century and flood the country with opium.''</p> <!-- Block 195 --> <p><strong>12.15pm:</strong> I'm pooped. Tom Bryant is taking the MBM baton and he'll run with it all the way to 3pm.</p> <!-- Block 196 --> <p><strong>12.25pm:</strong> Afternoon all. You'll be pleased to learn that Lolo Jones has won her 100m hurdles heat. \"My body knows what to do now. It felt really easy,\" she says modestly. Meanwhile Rafa Nadal is two sets up and 2-1 ahead in his hunt for gold. And that is all the news I've managed to find in a desperate two minute flick through various TV channels.</p> <!-- Block 197 --> <p><strong>12.28pm:</strong> An email about Olympic medals that relates to several earlier emails that I haven't yet had a chance to read dept: \"I make it 47 golds for the British Empire. Mind, I'm including the USA and France in those figures,\" says Colin Williams, controversially.</p> <!-- Block 198 --> <p><strong>12.32pm:</strong> It's noisy down near the start of the final heat of the women's 100m hurdles and one of the runners is getting aggro about it. Well, if raising a polite hand and standing up is aggro. It affects the Guinean runner, who runs straight into the first hurdle, making little attempt to jump it, and then falls over. Her Olympic Games has lasted precisely 1.23 seconds. It could only have gone worse if she'd been disqualified for two false starts.</p> <!-- Block 199 --> <p><strong>12.35pm:</strong> Meanwhile, in the hammer, there are some big men wearing improbably skimpy outfits. The Belarussian thrower has more to throw for then just gold, too. He's been promised a lifetime's supply of suasages if he wins. Tasty. Bridgitte Foster-Hylton won that 100m hurdles heat, by the way, and Brit Sarah Claxton has also progressed. Good for her.</p> <!-- Block 200 --> <p><strong>12.37pm:</strong> \"The Chinese team are very poor in the catching the hammer event,\" chortles Gary Naylor of the antics of the Chinese judges scurrying about measuring the throws.</p> <!-- Block 201 --> <p><strong>12.40pm:</strong> North Korea's Hong Un Jong has claimed the women's gymnastics vault gold, and is proudly raising her bouquet of flowers to the assembled jumping and tumbling fans in attendance. There's some hot Brit action coming up soon on the pommel horse, too, I've been reliably informed.</p> <!-- Block 202 --> <p><strong>12.42:</strong> In equestrianism news ... it's <em>still</em> going on. How can this be? Is there anything left for them to jump over? Meanwhile, the man from Belarus has just furthered his lifetime of suasages cause after spinning and hurling his hammer 81.61m - which is a long way in hammer terms, apparently. However the Slovenian has just thrown 82.02m, jeopardising the suasage riches for the Belarussian.</p> <!-- Block 203 --> <p><strong>12.45pm:</strong> The sausage man's name, incidentally, is Vadim Devyatovskiy. Probably should have mentioned that earlier. Rafa Nadal is now 4-2 up in the third set, so expect him to be another to do that 'hilarious' biting-the-gold-medal-to-see-if-it's-real routine.</p> <!-- Block 204 --> <p><strong>12.46pm:</strong> Make that 5-2 now for Nadal.</p> <!-- Block 205 --> <p><strong>12.49pm:</strong> Stuck in an epic deuce battle, Nadal has had three gold medal points and blown them all, he's now up 5-3. There's a lot of grunting going on - even more than in the hammer.</p> <!-- Block 206 --> <p><strong>12.50pm:</strong> \"On the BBC trailer that they've been using to show the favourites for some of the track and field events, there is a load of text on the screen. Am I right in thinking that this is Japanese text and not Chinese?\" asks Ruth Jones who, despite having the title Dr in her email address, thinks that I'm the man who might know. I'll put this one over to the learned readers, Ruth.</p> <!-- Block 207 --> <p><strong>12.53pm:</strong> Brit Jeanette Kwkye is running in the semi-final of the women's 100m ... and ... she gets a good start ... and finishes in third! That means she's in the final. Nadal has clinched gold in the Olympics and is rolling about on the floor as if to convince people that this actually means something to him.</p> <!-- Block 208 --> <p><strong>12.55pm:</strong> \"If Gary Naylor thinks the Chinese bad at the hammer catching, he obviously hasn't seen their catching the javelin team in action \u2013 absolute rubbish, I could do better,\" ho-ho-hos Michelle Houtman.</p> <!-- Block 209 --> <p><strong>12.57pm:</strong> \"What a swing to be able to rescue an exploding set of legs like that,\" is how the commentator in the gymnastics starts his coverage of the Chinese competitor Xiao Qin's efforts on the pommel horse. Disappointingly, the man in question's legs appear to be resolutely unexploded. Shame.</p> <!-- Block 210 --> <p><strong>1pm:</strong> Once you do those flares, you are risking everything,\" the commentary team continue of the American's efforts on the pommel. There's also more talk about exploding legs. I have absolutely no understanding of this sport at all. Is this the most incomprehensible, yet exciting sounding, terminology of any event?</p> <!-- Block 211 --> <p><strong>1.02pm:</strong> \"8,000 pairs of eyes staring down at you - that's pressure,\" says one commentator. \"That's 36,000 eyes in total,\" confirms the other one, helpfully. And here comes Louis Smith for Team GB.</p> <!-- Block 212 --> <p><strong>1.05pm:</strong> \"There's the spindle and here's the triple Russian ...\" continues the nonsensical commentary. However young Louis seems to have done well. He did a good undercut out but broke form, too - meaning he has lost out in style, which must mean something to somebody. He scores 15.725, putting him into silver medal position with two gymnasts to go.</p> <!-- Block 213 --> <p><strong>1.06pm:</strong> Louis Smith will definitely get bronze! The next competitor has fallen off the pommel, blowing his chances. That's GB's first ever gymnastic medallist at the Olympics.</p> <!-- Block 214 --> <p><strong>1.07pm:</strong> \"When he exploded, he had nowhere to go,\" says the commentator of Fuentes Busmante, before adding \"he ran out of leather there\" for good measure. \"When you lose that swing, there's no return,\" confirms the other. WHAT ARE THESE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT?!</p> <!-- Block 215 --> <p><strong>BRONZE FOR BRITAIN</strong> Louis Smith gets third after being beaten into second by Croat Felipe Ude. China get the gold. But that really is fantastic from Smith - that's Britain's first ever men's Olympic medal on the apparatus. Well done to the 19-year-old.</p> <!-- Block 216 --> <p><strong>1.12pm:</strong> \"Do those guys wear anything to protect their knackers on the pommel horse?\" asks Alex Pace, not unreasonably. Given the insanely tight trousers they are wearing, it's very easy to confirm that, no. No they don't.</p> <!-- Block 217 --> <p><strong>1.14pm:</strong> \"I'm sure that was novelty 80s band Bad Manners' front man Buster Bloodvessel competing for Poland in the hammer. We'll know if he sticks his tongue out,\" Gary Naylor. Hey! Less of the novelty, Gary, Bad Manners are ska royalty. The Sausage man hammer thrower may be going hungry for the foreesable future. His last throw of 81.51 only gets him into third place.</p> <!-- Block 218 --> <p><strong>1.16pm:</strong> \"Colin Williams is not entirely wrong to include USA in our British Empire tally ... never forget that the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, signed at the end of the War of Spanish Succession, granting Her Majesty's Government \u2013 in addition to medal-free zones like Gibraltar \u2013 the entire eastern seaboard of (what is now erroneously known as) USA as far south as Philadelphia,\" writes Jonathan Myerson. \"So we would have to find out which state each competitor comes from but I think worth it in the long run.\" I beg to differ, Jonathan.</p> <!-- Block 219 --> <p><strong>1.19pm:</strong> Josh in Singapore writes to let us know that: \"Your coverage of the China vs Singapore women's team table tennis final is shocking to say the least!\" Helpfully, he seems to be applying for the position. \"This will be Singapore's first Olympic medal in 40 something years if they win. The hilarity being that all the Singapore girls are born and bred Chinese. Anyway, the Chinese girls are up 1-0 after the first singles game in this best of 5.\" So now you know.</p> <!-- Block 220 --> <p><strong>1.26pm:</strong> Tasha Danvers has won her 400m hurdles heat in impressive style. That's a good run for the Brit. In fact, this weekend is shaping up to be one of the Britain's most successful sporting weekends ever. Makes a nice change, doesn't it?</p> <!-- Block 221 --> <p><strong>1.29pm:</strong> \"What is it with Nadal's knickers?\" writes Al Parkes. \"On his way to winning gold, on every one of his serves, I was reminded of a quote by the great Jim Royle: \"I paid a pound for these underpants and I've got 50 pence worth stuck up me arse\" He's got nothing on the gymnasts, Al. Both meat and two veg were very much on display there.</p> <!-- Block 222 --> <p><strong>1.32pm:</strong> The most tedious game of baseball ever has finally reached it's conclusion. After four rain-affected days and 10, <em>10</em>, scoreless innings, the epic battle between South Korea and China is over after a stunning* 1-0 win for the South Koreans. The winning run was scored in the bottom of the 11th. As my colleague, Taimour, has just said: \"Bet the Chinese crowd forced to watch that to make up crowd number enjoyed that one\". </p> <p>*<em> Use of the word stunning may not be strictly accurate</em></p> <!-- Block 223 --> <p><strong>1.34pm:</strong> Kozmus has won the hammer, while the sausage man comes in second. He'll be both angry and hungry - which is a dangerous combo for a big man who throws hammers for a living. Don't get in his way later. From the TV pictures I've just seen, the winner of the women's 400m hurdles heat ran the second half of the race with her shoelaces undone. Does that mean she gets more points?</p> <!-- Block 224 --> <p><strong>1.39pm:</strong> Benjamin Arthur has helpfully emailed in what I presume is a complete summary of all the medals that would be claimed by the British Empire in the Imperial Olympics. Unfortunately, I can't open it on my computer. However, I'd suggest that, if he has that much time on his hands, he might like to click <a href=\"http://www.timeout.com/london/\">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 225 --> <p><strong>1.43pm:</strong> Christine Ohuruogu is no doubt stretching, lunging and doing whatever else these runners do to warm up as she'll be going round the track in the 400m semi-final in 20 minutes' time. Provided, of course, she remembers to turn up, which is by no means a guarantee given her previous form in keeping her athletic commitments.</p> <!-- Block 226 --> <p><strong>1.46pm:</strong> While you wait for that you can, of course, head on over to Paul Doyle to find out what's going on in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/17/chelsea.portsmouth\">Chelsea's tussle against Portsmouth</a>.

He's emailed his workings to me again in a form I can read and the results are, it's safe to say bewildering. Almost totally worthless, but bewildering nonetheless.

Good lord, she's killing the competition. She finishes in first in 49.9 and she slowed down considerably towards the end. Hmm, Ohuruogo might struggle there.</p> <!-- Block 234 --> <p><strong>2.11pm:</strong> \"We've been sitting here debating 'sports' that should be dropped from the Olympics and ping pong was top of the list.

  "<p>Pulling each other by the hair, the Roma children scrap as they take turns at flicking their skinny wrists over the flaming funeral candles. Before the same Orthodox Christian shrine, their grandmother recites the Lord's Prayer in a gravelly Romany tongue. </p> <p>'Am Mora Dat con san ando cheri.' The words leave her mouth in whispers as she crosses herself and kisses a gold crucifix around her neck. The smallest child, no older than four, runs towards me, sticks out her tongue, and gestures a V for vaffanculo - the ubiquitous Italian fuck off - and disappears outside.</p> <p>The damp ceiling of the two-room prefabricated hut the Gypsies call home is on the verge of collapse. The plastic-film windows, looking out on to the drab exterior walls of Naples's most infamous prison, are so flimsy they wobble in the faint breeze. There are mattresses everywhere: on the floor, propped up against the sink. Like the inhabitants, they are thin and threadbare. The only nod to modernity is a gigantic home entertainment consul in the corner, spewing out a DVD of distorted recordings of Balkan folk songs. The wake we are attending in Naples's most notorious Romany camp has been going for 10 days. Alcohol is scattered around the room; clear, foul-smelling moonshine sits overflowing from plastic cups and reclaimed Peroni bottles; a half-blind mongrel sleeps fitfully among the detritus of a thousand hand-rolled cigarettes. </p> <p>Alongside a sepia portrait of the revered Capuchin friar, Padre Pio, stand blurry digital prints of 13-year-old Cristina and 11-year-old Violetta Djeordsevic - two Roma sisters whose sudden deaths in the shallow waters of a public beach on Italy's Amalfi Coast last month encapsulated the threat of racism in modern Europe. It is a tragedy that has focused international attention on the ragged edge of Italy's most chaotic city. The teenagers' youth and beauty in the photographs, strangely, comes as a shock. Up until now, like most of the world, I had only seen their prostrate bodies, covered by short beach towels, with just their feet left exposed, on the scruffy beach at Torregaveta, a decrepit seaside suburb on the outer edge of the Bay of Naples. </p> <p>On the morning of 17 July, Cristina and Violetta, along with their cousins Manuela and Diana, had made the regular journey from the dismal camp we are sitting in to one of Naples's most popular beaches. Walking two miles to the nearest public transport link, and skipping aboard the local train that skirts the coastal cliffs of the city, the girls planned to sell trinkets - small wooden turtles carved by Nigerian immigrants - to daytrippers along the bay. At Torregaveta, after a long hot day with no sales, the sisters dared each other to jump from rocks into the sea. Violetta went first and disappeared, swept beneath the waves. Cristina, the eldest, jumped in to save her. Both drowned, clinging on to each other. </p> <p>What happened next shocked the world.</p> <p>The girls were recovered from the sea by a passer-by and later declared dead by a lifeguard who called for help as Manuela and Diana wept, banging their tiny fists on the corpses. </p> <p>As the police arrived, their cousins, distraught and in shock, were taken away to contact relatives. Two beach towels were used to cover the dead Roma girls. And then something extraordinary occurred. </p> <p>Summer beach life resumed around the bodies for three hours until an ambulance finally showed up. In the most striking image of all, a couple nonchalantly ate a picnic while looking on at the scene. Another threw a frisbee nearby. The indifference, picked up by newspapers and TV stations across the world, was seen by the country's liberal elite to be the final straw. The most senior Catholic in Naples, Cardinal Crescenzio Sepe, was the quickest to point out the coarsening of human sentiment which the behaviour in Torregaveta represented: 'Cristina and Violetta,' he told the Italian media, 'had faced nothing but prejudice in life and indifference in death; an unforgivable truth.' </p> <p>In Rome, the government winced. Masters of realpolitik, they knew that the deaths of Cristina and Violetta, both born in Italy but full-blood Roma, had come at a bad time for the nation, forced in recent months to defend itself to its European neighbours on charges of discrimination against Gypsies and immigrants. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who swept to power for a third time on a thinly disguised anti-immigration ticket, was in the middle of a controversial yet populist programme of fingerprinting the country's 150,000 Roma, some of whose families have been in Italy since the middle ages. According to critics it has become impossible to disguise the Fascist undertones of these actions, and they point to the fact that the first expulsions of Gypsies took place in 1926 under Benito Mussolini. The dictator's political heirs, the 'post-fascist' National Alliance, are now coalition partners in Berlusconi's government. </p> <p>In May this year, rumours of an abduction of a baby girl by a Gypsy woman in Naples triggered an orgy of violence against Roma camps by thugs wielding iron bars, who torched caravans and drove Gypsies from their slum homes in dozens of assaults, orchestrated by the notoriously violent local mafia, the Camorra. The response of Berlusconi's government? 'That is what happens when Gypsies steal babies,' shrugged Roberto Maroni, Italy's interior minister and a key Berlusconi ally. </p> <p>For the 10m Europeans all loosely labelled as Roma or Gypsies, life is an endless procession of marginalisation and prejudice. Corralled into settlements across the continent, 84 per cent of Roma in Europe are estimated to live below the poverty line. Perhaps even more shocking is the lack of a more detailed picture. Official indifference and reluctance on the part of the Roma themselves means data on life expectancy, infant mortality, employment and literacy rates are sparse. Yet all are likely to be lower than those of mainstream society.</p> <p>The plight of the Roma has been a part of European life since their mysterious migration from Rajasthan around 1,000AD. Queen Elizabeth I was the first who sought to expel the Roma from England. German Emperor Karl VI ordered their extermination in 1721. In parts of the Balkans, Roma were traded as slaves until the middle of the 19th century. In the 20th century, hundreds of thousands of Roma perished in the Nazi Holocaust, known in Gypsy folklore as the Porrajmos or 'The Devouring'. How Roma like Cristina and Violetta came to be born in Naples has more to do with the modern legacy of war in the Balkans. In the early Nineties, thousands of Gypsies crossed the Adriatic after the outbreak of fighting in Yugoslavia and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. For many of the Gypsies, the majority of whom were illegal immigants, lawless Naples was the place where they could disappear into the chaos.</p> <p>It's 6.30am in the graffiti-strewn centro storico of Old Naples. Two young priests whizz past on an ancient canary-yellow Vespa, the engine putt-putting through the silent streets. Running a red light and skirting the baroque entrance to the chapel of San Lorenzo Maggiore, the seminarians roughly scrape the kerb and abandon the scooter. They are late for morning prayers. Down through the narrow cobblestone streets, far below them, is the harbour and the azure Mediterranean. </p> <p>Sparkling in the morning sunshine, the waters of the bay stretch west, out towards the dark mass of Vesuvius and Campi Flegrei, the 'burning fields', the volcanic plateau the Greeks once thought were the gates to hell.</p> <p>Morning comes slowly here. Old men, their wrinkled faces as scorched and cracked as the dry earth, are the first to emerge, setting out white plastic chairs on the narrow streets outside their tenement homes as their wives clatter pans indoors and get on with their morning chores. </p> <p>Armed with soapy water and sponges, a ragged group of municipal workers sets about removing hundreds of posters that have appeared across the city overnight. 'Diritti per tutti' (Rights for all). 'White, black, yellow, red. Stop apartheid now,' they proclaim beneath crude images of fingerprints. Beneath the new posters lie fading old ones calling for the mass deportation of Naples's Roma Gypsies and immigrants.</p> <p>'Italy is divided on these girls, on the fate of the Roma. The conscience of the people has been pricked. You can see this on the walls of our city,' says Francesca Saudino, our early morning guide and a campaigning Naples-based lawyer with Osservazione, a nationwide pressure group for Roma rights. 'The reaction to the death of these children goes beyond anything that has happened before. The incident has exposed a long-held social realism in our country: that many working-class people think the Roma no better than animals, and the government is using this xenophobia to win votes and popularity. People are ashamed. The deaths of these girls has come to represent something more, perhaps a battle for Italy's soul.' </p> <p>We are heading to Scampia, the toughest and most lawless public housing estate in Europe. The taxi driver, reluctantly taking us there, isn't pleased. He is charging us 'treble' and doesn't tire of telling us, spitting out the demand at each traffic light between puffs of his cigarette. </p> <p>Scampia is home of the infamous public housing towers known as Le Vele (the Sails), the place where Naples's many drug addicts come to score the cheapest high-grade heroin and crack cocaine in the EU. A land of outsiders and lawbreakers living on the fringes of society, the district is also home to the majority of the city's Roma. At the municipal entrance to the estate, with a nod to Dante's Inferno, someone with a canister of red spray paint has written: 'Abandon hope all ye who enter here.' </p> <p>Our first sight is a string of burnt-out cars. It looks and feels like the Farza district of Kabul. The buildings appear as if they've been beset by a natural disaster. The elevators in most are gone. Broken pipes spew water everywhere and the forecourts are covered with knee-deep garbage. The air outside smells of burning tyres. From the drab high-rise flats, conspicuous lookouts scan the roads for undercover police or special drug enforcement teams. Scampia has long been a key base for the narcotics arm of the Camorra.</p> <p>Our driver drops us in the middle of Via Cupa Perillo alongside the carcass of a Fiat Punto. It marks the entrance to Campo Autorizzato, Scampia's only official Roma camp - a couple of hundred caravans and prefabs strung on a narrow spit of land overshadowed by the high walls of Naples's notorious Carcere Di Secondigliano prison. It is the place where Cristina and Violetta were born and lived all their lives.</p> <p>'This is a reclaimed swamp,' says Francesca. 'Some 700 Roma live here without running water, toilets, sewers, garbage disposal or proper heating and cooking facilities.' </p> <p>As we approach the entrance, children play beside a polluted creek amid excrement spewed by an open-air communal toilet. Standing waiting for us in the centre of the roughshod tarmac road is Miriana Djeordsevic, the mother of the two dead girls. Shrouded in black with thin silk slippers on her feet, she is clutching the last photograph of her dead daughters. The mood around her is tense. In the days since the girls died, Miriana's extended family have been forced to give their fingerprints to the authorities. In recent weeks, Roma groups from here have demonstrated, wearing the black triangles Gypsies were forced to wear in the concentration camps.</p> <p>Inside Miriana's home, vodka is offered, poured by a tattooed man covered in gold chains and bracelets. Grinning through blackened teeth he offers no introduction. Most of the Roma women from this camp work as day labourers in agriculture, others, the elderly and the children, beg. But some of the men run one of the biggest car theft and stripping-down rackets in southern Italy. Others, living deeper in the shadows, earn their money from selling drugs and violence. Looking around the room it is clear this black economy does not produce wellbeing or health or luxury, only symbols of power, wealth and social advancement among the men. Their half-naked infants and wives look as unhealthy as some women and children in sub-Saharan Africa.</p> <p>'The girls drowned in the sea,' Miriana tells me firmly. 'There has been talk in the newspapers, lies, that they were murdered, that there was no postmortem. They drowned in the sea, playing like the innocents they were. The real crime was what happened around them. Those people by the water, they ignored the children, like they were dead dogs washed up in the Mediterranean. My daughters were not subhuman.' </p> <p>Miriana hands me another photograph of Violetta. She is posing in a ruffled pink dress. 'She wanted to be a dancer. She didn't want to go to school. She only wanted to be beautiful. Cristina was a bad influence on Violetta. She didn't like school. She hated living in the camp. Her grandmother said she was just trying to find her place somewhere, but she would've grown into a strong woman. She had the will and the determination. Above all she wanted to be able to walk into the shops in the city, look at the dresses without being chased by the police. She would cut dresses out of magazines and place a cut-out of her head on to them. It was her way of escaping. Violetta just watched. She worshipped her big sister.</p> <p>'In the days after the girls died a Catholic priest visited us and apologised for the local people on the beach, who he said had misunderstood the situation. I asked him why the Italians hated us, why they looked at the bodies of two dead children and smeared on sun cream and he had no answers. He wept and told me the Roma were still God's children. I told him it doesn't feel like it. We are the ones the Italians blame for the poverty outside the camp. That is their own making, not ours, not my children's fault.'</p> <p>Miriana is barely 30 but looks a decade older. Married at 14 and a mother of five by her early twenties, she escaped the Bosnian-Serbian border area as a teenager, hoping for a new life in Italy. All three of her surviving children are unschooled. The youngest don't have birth certificates. They simply don't exist and she wants to keep it that away. One of the last things Cristina and Violetta did was to be fingerprinted by the authorities. 'Cristina and Violetta gave their fingerprints shortly before they died. Violetta was upset. She ran away and started crying. She thought the police were coming to take her away. Cristina was angry and scrubbed the ink from her thumb. She understood everything. She knew we were being treated like animals. She died knowing she had no real hope of a better life.' </p> <p>Later, as we walk around the camp, we are faced down with intimidating glares. One man spits at my feet. The ethnic fingerprinting drive, part of a broader crackdown on Italy's 3.5m recent economic immigrants and carried out in an atmosphere of hysterical rhetoric about crime and security, has left the Roma more bitter than ever. Catholic human rights organisations have damned the fingerprinting of Gypsies as 'evoking painful memories' of the Nazi persecution. The chief rabbi of Rome insisted this week that it 'must be stopped now'. Amos Luzzatto, former head of the Italian Union of Jewish Communities, said that the policy of fingerprinting recalled 'days when I could not go to school, and people would point at me saying: \"Look Mummy, it's a Jew.\" This is a country that has lost its memory.' </p> <p>But Massimo Barra, head of the Italian Red Cross, which has been monitoring the process, insisted last week that the aim was to integrate Roma people into Italian society. If children were fingerprinted, it would be done 'as a game', he said. 'We are building bridges, not walls.' </p> <p>Officially, the reasons for the fingerprinting programme appear simple enough: to allow the government to compile accurate census data and ensure that Gypsy children go to school. But human rights groups are concerned. As part of sweeping anti-immigration measures the prime minister has also appointed special commissioners to 'deal' with Gypsies in the three major Italian cities - Naples, Milan and Rome. </p> <p>According to Francesca Saudino, fingerprinting lies at the heart of the anguish and disenchantment felt by the Roma. 'The Italian right blames much of the country's street crime on the Roma, in particular on children sent out by adults to rob and steal,' she said. 'This is an hysterical inaccuracy. There are an estimated 152,000 Roma in 700 camps across Italy and the Interior Ministry hopes to dismantle them all. Thirty per cent have Italian citizenship, but the rest are immigrants, many from Romania and the Balkans. We suspect that the Gypsies are being identified only so that they can be expelled.' </p> <p>She added: 'A third of Neapolitan children don't go to school at all or have to repeat years. Illiteracy here is at Third World levels. The children who live on the outskirts of Naples, in the Spanish quarters and in Piscinola, San Giovanni a Teduccio, Poggioreale, Secondigliano and Torre del Greco, they are all the same, they hate school, their teachers and the selectivity of the system. They hate Italy and the Italians, too. Many are the children of Russian immigrants, but they are not fingerprinted or treated as outlaws. You cannot have one law for the Roma and one law for everyone else.'</p> <p>At the core of the issue, according to human rights groups, are several key politicians. One of them is Umberto Bossi, head of the Northern League, a small party of restyled former Fascists, anti-immigrant forces and traditional conservatives. Bossi has emerged as Italy's kingmaker, the power player who was key in returning Silvio Berlusconi to office in the recent elections and who many believe will continue to call the shots. Bossi and three other members of his party were given choice seats in the new cabinet, including control of the Interior Ministry, which oversees police and most domestic security. Bossi is a man who once advocated shooting at boats bringing immigrants to Italy's shores. </p> <p>The Northern League emerged in the early Nineties as a party advocating the secession of Italy's wealthier north from the rest of the country. The party these days has toned down the secession rhetoric. Instead, it campaigns for more autonomy and 'devolution' of central government powers to regional authorities. Bossi was named Minister for Reforms in the new government, an ideal platform for changing the law to give more autonomy to the north.</p> <p>Another cabinet post went to the Northern League's colourful Roberto Calderoli, best remembered for appearing on TV in a T-shirt emblazoned with a cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad, and for planning to parade pigs on land where Muslims were attempting to build mosques. Berlusconi's other main partner in government is the National Alliance, a party formed as a successor to Mussolini's Fascists. Its leader, Gianfranco Fini, who has struggled to distance himself from his neofascist past, became speaker of the lower chamber of parliament.</p> <p>Yet Giuliano Ferrara, formerly Berlusconi's media spokesman and now a prominent editor and TV pundit, claims the rise of the right is a myth. 'It was entirely predictable that once Berlusconi returned to power a Greek chorus would appear to warn us all that Italian democracy is in danger, that Italy is introducing mass deportations and concentration camps,' he said. 'In reality, violence against immigrants and Gypsies has been limited.' The true problem, Ferrara says, is that Italy, more than any other country in Europe, has had to cope with an influx of immigrants who end up living in poverty on the edges of cities - the very margins in which Italy's own poorest people live. 'There is no ethnic persecution in Italy,' Ferrara insists. 'To draw broad comparisons with what happened to the Jews, who were exterminated, is irresponsible.'</p> <p>Ironically, Europe is supposedly in the middle of a 'Decade of Roma Inclusion', a \u20ac30bn project launched by the EU in 2005 when the governments of the countries with the largest Roma populations - Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia and Slovakia - agreed to close the gap in education, employment, health and housing. Ask the Gypsies themselves and they will tell you it has had little effect on their lives. As the Open Society Institute, funded by billionaire George Soros, who has widely supported the Roma, said in a recent report, most governments see the answer to the Roma problem in terms of 'sporadic measures' rather than coherent policies. When asked what lay at the heart of the problem, one MEP said: 'Look. We want to help them. We don't lack the laws and we don't lack the money. The problem is political will in countries like Italy and, ultimately, the Roma themselves - many don't want to be part of society, even if society is trying to help them. There is no trust, only bitterness and scepticism. In the case of Italy, it is on both sides.'</p> <p>'My name is Veronica Selimovic and I am Italian,' cries the barefoot Gypsy child as she skips nimbly through mud and oil-slicked puddles at Camp Nomadi Aurelia on the outskirts of Rome. Young men stand among graveyards of wrecked cars and rusting bodywork, smoking smuggled cigarettes. All around us are burnt tyres, cartridge cases, condoms. The Gypsies are restless. They look prepared to leave in the dead of night; they claim it is with good reason. The political figure now presiding over their camp is the National Alliance's Gianni Alemanno, who was elected mayor of Rome in April. As he took office his supporters gave the Fascist salute, chanting 'Duce, Duce'.</p> <p>Clutching a black and white photograph of her father, 60-year-old Satka Selimovic's glaucomic eyes water and droop as she recalls her life on the fringes of Italian society. 'I was born in Italy, on the outskirts of Venice, after the Second World War. My family thought life would offer us a second chance. I told this to my own children, that life would turn out to be better and they say this to my granddaughter, Veronica. People may say we are bitter and to blame for our own isolation, but we tell each new generation of Roma they will be included and accepted and each time it feels like a betrayal.'</p>",
  "<p>Relying on the failings of others is never where you want to be in an Olympic tournament, and the Argentine women's team is also not the team you want to be relying on to fail. But that was where the British women's team found itself before the penultimate round of matches at the Olympic Green Hockey Stadium.</p> <p>With the reigning Olympic champions Germany unbeaten and looking sure to be one of the two teams to qualify from Pool B, a victory by the Germans over Argentina, who had dropped points with draws against Britain and the USA, would give the British women the chance to overtake the South Americans should they defeat Japan in the late evening game.</p> <p>The Argentine women, though, can be inspirational and their second-half performance was sublime hockey. Scoreless at half-time, the Argentine ball-players proceeded to bedazzle their opponents, scoring four times without reply and the star of the show was, predictably, Luciana Aymar.</p> <p>The 32-year-old Aymar is known as 'La Maga' (The Magician) and she amply illustrated why, tormenting the Germans throughout. Her strike in the 68th minute, which flew into the top corner of the net, was the finest moment of the match. The Germans simply had no answer to her control and pace down the left-hand side.</p> <p>The result was a dampener for British hopes, and they didn't start well in their must-win game either, a busy Japanese side retaining most of the possession. The breakthrough came just before half-time, however, when a ball whipped in from the right by Chloe Rogers was flicked into the net by Anne Panter.</p> <p>The Japanese equalised in the second half, with a strike by Keiko Miura in the 58th minutes, and the game looked to be petering out into a draw until Crista Cullen latched on to the ball in the melee following a penalty corner and thumped it in the net with 21 seconds left on the clock. There were scenes of jubilation on the field and the bench.</p> <p>\"We've got the USA next. It's a huge game and we are putting pressure on the top two which is where we want be,\" said Cullen. A win against the Americans on Monday should not be beyond them, but it's not enough in itself. To get into the semi-finals, either the Germans must lose their final match against Japan, or the Argentine team must lose to New Zealand. It's back to relying on others.</p> <p>In the crunch match in Pool A, the Netherlands defeated Australia 2-1, guaranteeing the Dutch women a place in the semi-final. The Australians will now face China in their final pool match for the second semi-final place, which may not be as easy as it once was. The Chinese hammered Korea 6-1 in their penultimate game.</p>",
  "<p>Finlandisation is back. During the cold war the term described those states which had a formal independence but existed in barely disguised servitude to Moscow. Finland, Jean-Francois Revel noted in his 1983 book. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/democracies-Jean-Francois-assistance-Lazitch-translated/dp/B000VZTVQI\">How Democracies Perish</a>, \"preserved the inviolability of its territory, what was left of it, and the right to live privately in a non-totalitarian society\" but was forbidden to accept Marshall Plan aid, join the EEC or sign trade agreements with Europe. It took its orders from Moscow in foreign policy. </p> <p>This is the fate Putin (and some in the west) now seek to impose on Georgia. And now, as then, Russia hopes to impose Finlandisation by a mix of hard and soft power. </p> <p>The hard power takes the form of tanks and taps. The tanks we saw rolling into Gori and taking control of the road to Tbilisi shortly after the signing of the deal brokered by President Sarkozy. The energy taps can be turned on and off according to whether a country pleases Russia. The gas tap was used by the Kremlin against Ukraine. German foreign policy towards Russia is now conducted in fear of the tap. (Indeed, Germany increasingly acts as an agent of Finlandisation within the EU and within Nato.) </p> <p>Soft power is used to establish a Finlandised state of mind in the west: Finlandisation is rightful because peaceful. During the cold war the French Communist Party would lead the attack against any link between Finland and the democratic west as \"militaristic\" and a \"threat to peace\". When trade links were proposed the French Communists thundered that \"any commercial agreement or association with the EEC was a threat to Finland's peaceful foreign policy\". </p> <p>Today, the soft power is deployed by an anti-American left and the Guardian's Seumas Milne <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/14/russia.georgia\">laid down</a> the line. </p> <p>The conflict in Georgia \"is not a story of Russian aggression, but of US imperial expansion\". Georgia is no fledgling democracy to be defended but a \"fully-fledged US satellite\". Its government came to power in a \"western-backed coup\" don't you know, and western support for Georgia meant \"conflict was only a matter of time\". And after all, \"'unipolar domination of the world has squeezed the space for genuine self-determination and the return of some counterweight has to be welcome\". </p> <p>Milne here manages something quite extraordinary: he \"forgets\" the mass escape from the prison house of nations that was only made possible by the collapse of Communism, while supporting the resurgence of an authoritarian Russia as the very means to open up \"genuine space for self-determination\". Astonishing. </p> <p>Milne finishes by making Georgia an offer it can't refuse: \"neutrality\". He uses the tones of a Mafia enforcer \u2013 a soft-spoken one, of course, like Tom Hagen from The Godfather (other people can put the horse's head in the bed). </p> <p>Then as now, hard and soft power work together to paralyse the military resistance of the country being Finlandised and the political will of the allies who should come to its aid. </p> <p>In 1958, when Fagerholm, the Finnish Socialist leader won parliamentary elections and seemed set to form a government without Communists, the President of Finland, Kekkonen, was summoned to Moscow and harangued by Khrushchev. \"Without wishing to intrude in Finland's internal affairs,\" Khrushchev insisted that Finland must \"have a well-disposed government\". Fagerholm withdrew his candidacy.</p> <p>Milne wants a government in Georgia (Georgia first, the others will follow) that is \"well-disposed\" to Russia. Soon enough he, and others, will echo Putin's calls for Georgia's pro-democratic pro-western president to be removed. Putin has cleverly laid the ground for this. The ceasefire terms dictate all future arrangements on troops, territory and borders must be agreed by Georgia and Russia. But Russia also says it will not talk to Saakashvili. Charles Krauthammer has <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/08/the_cards_in_americas_hands.html\">predicted</a> what must logically follow: \"Regime change becomes the first requirement for any movement on any front. This will be Putin's refrain in the coming days. He is counting on Europe to pressure Saakashvili to resign and/or flee to 'give peace a chance'.\"</p> <p>And there is Simon Jenkins right on cue <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/13/russia.georgia\">saying</a>: \"Non-interference, coupled with a realpolitik acceptance of 'great power' spheres of influence, is still a roughly stable basis for international relations.\" Saakashvili, Jenkins sneers, is a \"poor advert for a Harvard education\". </p> <p>Europe seems institutionally predisposed to Finlandisation. For example, Russia murders its own citizens who bring cases against it at the European Court of Human Rights, but gets to stay in the Council of Europe with full voting rights. Where is the outrage? Well, come on, \"No country is a perfect democracy,\" said Terry Davies, the secretary-general of the Council of Europe. (Back in the day, Jean-Francois Revel nailed this kind of mindset - \"the democracies are making their usual mistakes: ignoring even recent history, interpreting the facts in the way most favourable to Moscow, the way the Kremlin wants them to choose\".)</p> <p>Today, given the balance of forces, the imposition of Finlandisation will also depend on the irresolution and foreign policy blundering of the democracies. Sadly, as Ron Asmus, an assistant secretary of state under Bill Clinton, set out in an <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=9da1fd2d-1701-470b-b734-3fc365571e0d\">excellent article</a>in The New Republic (\"How the west botched Georgia\") blunders there have been aplenty. </p> <p>First, maintaining the fiction that the Russian troops in South Ossetia were peacekeepers was risky under Yeltsin but quite insane under Putin. \"What started out as a neutral role became a front for pursuing neo-imperial Russian objectives \u2026 Had we pushed for real neutral peacekeeping forces, we might have prevented this war.\"</p> <p>Second, after Kosovan independence it was obvious Russia would seek pay-back. \"In spite of this, the West never had a plan to shield Georgia from the possible fallout.\"</p> <p>Third, in March, Nato, with Germany in the lead cold-shouldered Georgia by dropping the <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/docu/handbook/2001/hb030103.htm\">Membership Action Plan</a> (MAP). This \"probably accelerated the path to war\", says Asmus, by giving a green light to Russia. </p> <p>Fourth, it is rumoured \"President Bush has on several key occasions failed to raise our commitment to Georgia in meetings with Putin - including right after the Nato summit.\" </p> <p>Fifth, the EU has \"been weak both in terms of form and substance\". Indeed, \"some EU leaders profess the need to stay neutral in the conflict while Georgia is being destroyed\". </p> <p>Sixth, the west missed every signal of Russia's military intent (the most obvious of which was probably the Russian military exercise for an invasion). Asmus notes that when a European friend told a senior Russian official in late July that he was planning to visit Georgia in September, \"the response was that he might want to go sooner and that September might be too late\". </p> <p>The Finlandisation of Georgia would have momentous consequences. Russia would gain control of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, strangle Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, and push Germany and Europe further down the road of appeasement. </p> <p>The democracies should draw a red line, but not around South Ossetia. If the South Ossetians want to be part of Russia they should be. Blocking the self-determination of peoples is no part of progressive internationalism. Rather, the democracies should act in concert to ensure that any attempt by Russia to Finlandise the newer members of our family will not stand.</p>",

  "<p>I've done a few posts now about scumbag author Jerome Corsi, so it occurs to me that I should devote some attention to his respectable counterparts who've written books on McCain.</p> <p>There are three: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Real-McCain-Conservatives-Independents-Shouldnt/dp/0979482291/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1218889802&amp;sr=1-1\">The Real McCain</a>, by Cliff Schecter; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Free-Ride-John-McCain-Media/dp/0307279405/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1218890109&amp;sr=1-1\">Free Ride: John McCain and the Media</a>, by David Brock and Paul Waldman; and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/McCain-Myth-Maverick-Matt-Welch/dp/0230608051/ref=pd_bbs_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1218890163&amp;sr=1-1\">McCain: The Myth of a Maverick</a>, by Matt Welch. All three were reviewed positively by <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/21470\">this particularly sagacious critic</a> in The New York Review of Books not long ago (all right, it was me).</p> <p>What, the right-wing doubter will ask me, makes these books different from Corsi's? It is obviously the case that the above four authors were going to write anti-McCain books from the start, just as Corsi was going to write an anti-Obama book from the start. But that one simple fact does not make them the identical species of fish. Corsi is out to get rumor and innuendo flamboyantly inserted into the discourse. Go to Indonesia, find a few people who are willing to say that a nine-year-old boy, i.e. young Obama, may indeed have gone to the local mosque, on that basis slap it up as \"fact\" (one such source, recently pressed, had acknowledged that his memory may be foggy). The McCain authors are far more scrupulous than that. And one of them, Welch, isn't even a liberal. He's a libertarian. There is no equivalency whatsoever.</p> <p>Why does Corsi make a big splash, and these more serious books not? Well, first, because of the very fact that they're more serious. If they accused McCain of beating his first wife or something salacious and unprovable (and un-unprovable by McCain himself, which is the stock-in-trade of right-wing \"books\"), they'd have been all over cable tv. </p> <p>Second reason: Corsi debuted at No. 1 on the NY Times best-seller list, because right-wing membership groups buy these books in bulk. So should there be a liberal counterpart to this? There is one, in formation. It's the <a href=\"http://www.progressivebookclub.com/pbc2/home.pbc\">Progressive Book Club</a>, started just recently by my friend Elizabeth Wagely. Check it out and please join.</p>",

  "<p>Middleweight James DeGale today gave Britain's Olympic boxing squad a much needed fillip, with a smooth 11-5 victory over America's Shawn Estrada.</p> <p>Earlier in the day the British flyweight, Khalfid Yafai, had been well beaten by the Cuban, Andry Laffita, but DeGale was always in control against the limited Estrada, and now joins the light-heavyweight, Tony Jeffries, and the super-heavyweight, David Price, in the quarter-finals.</p> <p>\"Obviously there's a few distractions with some of the Brazilian women around \u2013 Brazilians are hot man, serious. And the food \u2013 there's even a McDonald's in the village so that's hard,\" said DeGale. \"To be honest it's a bit boring when we're not competing. We just have a laugh and try to bide our time but it's hard work trying to concentrate on your next fight. I've got three days off but I'd rather it was tomorrow.</p> <p>\"We've had two good fights. The first fight was close but Terry pulled me out because I had a cut and I wasn't completely fit. In the second fight I caught him with a good shot but that was close too. I just pray to God I can win a medal. It would mean everything to me. It's why I've boxed for 12 years and why I've spent the last two years training up in Sheffield five days a week.\"</p> <p>DeGale, flashy hands-held-low, did most of the pressing in the first round, even though the judges ruled that neither fighter had landed a scoring shot. But his more relaxed, languid style began to find gaps in Estrada's high guard as he established a 3-1 lead by the end of the second.</p> <p>The American, whose crude limitations would have brought a tear to 1956 middleweight champion Floyd Paterson, pressed forwardly in the latter rounds, but DeGale was always the sharper fighter and ran out a clear 10-5 winner.</p> <p>Meanwhile Yafai, a 19-year-old from Birmingham, was not too disappointed to be beaten by Laffita, the 2005 world championship silver medallist.</p> <p>\"It didn't go my way,\" he said. \"Obviously I'm disappointed, but I can't make any excuses. I got beaten fair and square. But I'll definitely be there for 2012,\" he added. \"This has been a great experience. This time last year, I wasn't thinking about Beijing, I was boxing in European juniors.\"</p> <p>The British boxing coach, Terry Edwards, was keen to put Yafai's defeat into context. \"The lad has only just turned 19,\" he said. \"We always said he was here for experience. He was fighting a very experienced 30-year-old man out there.\"</p> <p>\"He was tense in the first round and in the second the Cuban got away with it. Chasing someone is a lot harder than someone chasing you.\"</p> <p>Edwards also insisted a tough draw, and not poor performances, were to blame for his boxers' mixed showing so far. \"You need a bit of luck and perhaps we haven't had that,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We've had two Cubans, a Russian and a Chinese fighter in his own back yard. The media coverage perhaps raised expectations too high,\" he said. \"But we have three fighters in the quarter-finals and before the tournament I would have taken that.\"</p>",
  "<p>As Hu Jintao <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/08/olympics2008.china1\">opened the Olympics</a>, the Chinese president consigned Mao to distant history and laid claim to Confucianism.</p> <p>Many Chinese think that <a href=\"http://www.confucianstudies.com\">Confucianism</a> has values which the rest of humanity could learn from. Perhaps. But the question is, does the Chinese regime really follow Confucius? And rather than talking about human rights, perhaps we should ask the Chinese government what it understands by Confucianism and the dignity of man.</p> <p>China's human rights abuses have been chronicled on numerous occasions. And the country should not be allowed to get away with them by citing sovereignty and the length of its civilisation. Along with India, China has often responded to attacks at the UN with a critique of international human rights norms that are based on western individualism. Both countries say their cultures and philosophies are different. They assert that, apart from rights, the individual also has obligations to society. They claim that there is a balance between the rights of the individual and the rights of society over the individual. They explain that the duties of the individual to society are higher than the western conception of absolute personal rights.</p> <p>India has never really been able to articulate precisely which principles and ideas replace conventional human rights language and concepts. But China has. It has often invoked Confucianism as the basis of its age-old civilisation.</p> <p>Confucius, like many other leading eastern philosophers, lived in a period of absolute monarchy, and understandably his political concepts relate to similarly authoritarian regimes \u2013 and China, of course, is a one-party state. However, Confucianism does not exclude government by consensus and consequently some form of democracy. But China cannot excuse its human rights abuses and the large number of executions it carries out by citing the Confucian prerogative of the greater good of society over individual rights.</p> <p>In much western political theory, the state is sovereign and has sole power to use violence legitimately by due process of law and constitutionally laid-out principles. In return, the individual is guaranteed some rights and freedom against abuse by the state. In eastern theories, the emphasis tends to be on the duties the individual owes to the monarch and the state. But this is not a one-way street. The state has duties towards the individual \u2013 not simply a duty to look after the population's economic welfare but also uphold the dignity of individuals and show compassion to the weaker. This is the aspect that China does not explain or elucidate in public forums. It conveniently ignores it when defending its sovereign right to its own cultural systems. </p> <p>Confucius believed in just government, a moral king, a compassionate ruler. He believed in the concept of filial piety \u2013 the duty of the child, the younger and the ordinary citizen towards parents, elders and the powerful. Today, the latter means the state. But those in positions of power are expected to be wise and responsible. They are expected to show mercy and respect the dignity of the less powerful, and hence the individual. Governance by moral example was a Confucian maxim. And the concept of humanitarianism exists in Confucianism as \"<a href=\"http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln270/Berling-Confucianism.htm\">ren</a>\". Like enlightenment philosophers, Confucius even justified rebellion against an oppressive ruler. </p> <p>Perhaps we need to challenge China, not about its commitments to western-based concepts of human rights, but about its commitment to Confucianism. We should invite China to explain what Confucius says about the duties and responsibilities of the ruler in treating subjects, criminals and those who err. What does he say about human dignity? Or about respecting other people's territory? Or oppressive rulers? These problems existed in his time as much as they do now. </p> <p>Let's talk to the Chinese regime in its own language and play its game. Perhaps we should even invite senior members of the Chinese government to lecture us on Confucius and the dignity of the individual. Didn't Confucius say \"Your job is to govern, not to kill\" (Analects XII:19)?</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Against Standard Liege during the week, substandard Liverpool were an inept shambles. So Rafael Benitez has of course dropped the only player who looked capable of carving out a chance. Bye bye, Xabi, bye bye.</strong> Reina, Arbeloa, Dossena, Carragher, Hyypia, Benayoun, Kuyt, Gerrard, Plessis, Torres, Keane. Subs: Cavalieri, El Zhar, Aurelio, Ngog, Skrtel, Agger, Alonso.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Not only that, he's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/16/premierleague.liverpool\">prepared to sell him</a>.</strong> Istanbul was three years ago, and Rafa is fast using up all the pennies in his moral piggy bank.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Meanwhile Sunderland line up like this, with full debuts for Steed Malbranque, Teemu Tainio, El-Hadji Diouf and Pascal Chimbonda:</strong> Gordon; Chimbonda, Nosworthy, Collins, Bardsley; Malbranque, Tainio, Reid, Richardson; Diouf; Murphy. Subs: Ward, Whitehead, Edwards, Chopra, Leadbitter, Higginbotham, Stokes.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>KWIK KWIZ with Mike Cameron:</strong> \"If Liverpool lose this, can Rafa blame: #1 The board, #2 The CEO, #3 The tea lady? Answers on a postcard please.\" Yes, answers on a postcard, please, to Rebranded Website, Big Paper, Big Road, London. Or you could simply email. Or - my particular preference, this - not bother. One thing, though: if Rafa's men endure a sluggish start to the season, he might not have a platform from which to dispense excuses much longer, as it's pretty clear LFC suit-and-wig Rick Parry and at least one of the two owners don't like the cut of his jib. Which may or may not be fair, but ask yourself this question: would <em>you</em> give Benitez \u00a318m of <em>your own money</em> so he could replace Alonso with Gareth Barry?</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Kick off is at 5.30pm, by the way.</strong> Benitez has just told Setanta that he's not happy with the squad he's got, he's totally radged off about losing players to the Olympics, but he's not going to resign.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>They've pumped out Prokofiev, the teams have warmed up, and now we're off.</strong> The hope begins now, to be swiftly followed by pain and then feigned indifference. Sunderland get into a huddle, while Liverpool stand around in their fancy new silver away shirts. Shirts which really should have \"Candy\" written on them. The home side get the ball moving, swiftly lose it, but get it back within seconds as Plessis hoofs it long. The only way is up.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Reid takes the ball off Gerrard then attempts one of Stevie's trademark passes. It's a very successful facsimile, because the pass careers high into the stands.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Dossena attempts to find Torres with a long ball down the inside left channel, but the pass is way too high.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> A horrendous error from Sami Hyypia, 73, who tries to head back to Reina but weakly concedes possession to Diouf in the area. Carragher comes over to clear, but if the former Liverpool winger had hit that first time, Reina would have been in trouble.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> Liverpool are looking shaky at the back, Sunderland probing down either wing. They also can't hold onto the ball in midfield. A reminder: Xabi Alonso is on the bench. \"Alonso lives next door to Mikkel Arteta,\" gossips Gary Naylor. \"Everton have money for new players. Everton lost today. I think we know where this is going don't we?\" That would be the most ridiculous instance of needlessly giving your rivals a hand up since Peter Beardsley moved between the two clubs, or when Eric Cantona moved from Leeds to Manchester United. The way Liverpool is being run at the moment, it's not beyond the realms of possibility.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Gerrard slips the ball from the right into the box for Keane, who immediately passes it straight back out to the wing. At which point Gerrard lets his concentration wander, the ball wheeching under his foot. This is a very poor start from Liverpool, which will come as no surprise to anybody who witnessed that shameful Champions League showing in Belgium during the week.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Liverpool are having more of the ball, but they're not doing much with it. Sunderland seem perfectly happy about this state of affairs, waiting for the occasional opportunity to spring forward. This time Richardson nips down the left, the ball breaks to Diouf after a strong challenge between Reid and Kuyt, and his cross finds the head of Murphy, who tests Reina with a downward header. For a team noted for their parsimony, this new Liverpool defence is a rickety nonsense.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> Malbranque makes Plessis look like a child with a cute drop of the shoulder, scooting past him and launching yet another Sunderland raid. He slips the ball out right to Diouf, who buggers it up but that's not really the point. Sunderland are much the brighter team at the moment. Liverpool really need to get a shift on.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> This is turning into a nice and open game. Gerrard takes a pop from 35 yards or so. His effort is unsurprisingly blocked. Then Richardson tears off upfield, rides a rough challenge from Plessis and bears down on Hyypia, who has the rabbit-headlight act down pat. Eventually Gerrard rips upfield and takes the ball off Richardson's toe.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Carragher's legs have gone. He tries to shepherd a long ball out but doesn't have the pace or strength. Diouf circumvents his lumbering frame and pops off with the ball; outrageously, it's decided the ball went out of play and a promising chance for Sunderland is gone. I can't describe how bad Liverpool are playing at the moment. Well, I can, but saying I can't does the job well enough. Where's Xabi? On the bench. He's on the bench. The bench!</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Arbeloa, who was made to look very poor by Witzel and De Camargo against Liege, hauls Bardsley to the floor in order to stop him rampaging down the left. He was very lucky to escape a booking for that. The free kick is cleared up by Hyypia, but only after two headers on his own six-yard line. This defence, just as it did midweek, looks very shaky under the high ball. This is almost a return to the dog days of the Roy Evans regime. Is Kvarme playing?</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> A decent effort by Diouf, who picks the ball up to the left of the Liverpool area, shapes and shoots a curler towards the top-right corner. It only just flies over the bar. Sunderland look decent. Liverpool look awful.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Torres attempts to dribble the ball into the Sunderland area using only his shins. It's a lovely reminder of Emile Heskey at his best, and ends accordingly, the striker sailing across the turf on his teeth, the ball clanking out of play. \"That new Liverpool kit looks suspiciously like the one Manchester United were wearing against Southampton which they then changed at half time as they 'could not see each other',\" suggests Brendan Large. \"Benitez can surely blame the kit man as well if this goes badly.\"</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>The Black Dog is running with Liverpool fans. 31 minutes into the new season, we are.</strong> \"How depressing to be so depressed this early in the season,\" shouts Niall Mullen over the sound of running hot taps. \"Normally it's October before we realise how limited we are. Sweet Jemima Rafa, let us have a few weeks of hope before whinging about the squad,\" he concludes, before pouring himself a large gin and going off for a Special Shave.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> I tell you what, Liverpool could have had a penalty there, as Chimbonda barges Benayoun in the back. They don't get one, though, the referee having already whistled after Gerrard gets bowled over outside the box. The resulting free kick is useless. Liverpool are terrible.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> A bit better from Liverpool, who win a couple of corners and enjoy a bit of territorial superiority, but they do nothing whatsoever with any of it. \"You are reiterating a lot of the points being made around these parts since the pursuit of Gary Barry became public,\" writes Neil Mackie. \"Xabi Alonso is one of the finest midfielders that has graced our club since the days of Molby and Souness, and he has been treated deplorably by Benitez. The reason why Gerrard has been shifted further forward or to the right is Xabi; he can make the pinpoint long range passes that Gerrard, more often than not, misses. Xabi also has a wonderful first touch and an awareness of who to play the ball to as soon as he receives it, while then making himself open for a return pass. If he is sold to Arsenal then I can see him working well with Cesc Fabregas and the other touch players around him, and I can also see him do well at Everton. Barry, while a decent player, does not hold a candle to Alonso.\" Preach on, brother. Liverpool are terrible.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Kuyt decides to fizz a daisycutter goalwards while 25 yards out. Torres was completely free on the right-hand edge of the area. Liverpool's decision-making is terrible. Sunderland started well and shaded the first 15 minutes, but this is becoming more about Liverpool's failings than anything else.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> That is much, much better by Liverpool. Keane drags down a hopeful high ball on the edge of the area, switches it between his feet to diddle the advancing Nosworthy, and wallops a low shot just wide left of Gordon's goal.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>Running With Black Dog, the Liverpool way:</strong> \"Given the Liverpool manager's previous with boards at Real Madrid and Valencia, he seems now to be refusing to play Alonso just to show that he is not giving in to Liverpool's suits,\" suggests Ian Copestake, who is bang on for my money. \"This is a high-risk strategy.\" You've got that straight; this Liverpool side are terrible.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>HALF TIME: Sunderland 0-0 Liverpool.</strong> The home side look decent and compact, Diouf, Murphy and Richardson offering options up front. They've never looked under any serious pressure at the back, though they did begin to concede serious amounts of possession as the half went on. It didn't matter, however, because Liverpool have been witless up front. Alonso should be on the pitch.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>And we're off again!</strong> In fairness to Liverpool, they probably should have had a penalty for Chimbonda's barge on Benayoun. They will still have to improve drastically if they want to win this game. Anyway, they're making a change: Plessis, who has reportedly taken a knock, is replaced by... Xabi Alonso.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> A brilliant run from Diouf down the right. He turns Carragher inside and out, but there's nobody in the box to meet his fantastic cross. \"Andrea Dossena? What's that all about?\" is the start of observational comedian Neil Mackie's new routine. \"A rumoured \u00a37m for someone who may be worse than the chronically out-of-form John Arne Riise. Oh, and as for Rafa's whinging about the denial of the work permit for a woeful Sebastien Leto, maybe if he wasn't as awful as he is, then Bentiez would have played him a few more times last year, and then he would have got his permit. Not even past the first half of the first game and I can sense that this will be a typically modern Liverpool season.\"</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Alonso's first pass, a raking 40-yarder in the general direction of Torres, goes flying into the stands. Ah.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Kuyt tries a run down the right but it isn't much good. Bardsley has had him in his pocket all afternoon.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Keane, Kuyt, Gerrard, Alonso, Arbeloa and Benayoun pass it around for a while in front of the Sunderland area. They nearly spring the back line as Benayoun dinks a lovely ball in to Kuyt, but the striker falls over upon receipt of the ball and that is that. Much better from Benitez's side, though.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Murphy tears down the left and cuts a ball back from the byline. It takes every Liverpool defender out of the game. The ball goes to the feet of Diouf in the centre; it's a real chance but he drags his shot wide left of goal.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> Benayoun scuffs a shot towards goal. It takes a deflection and Gordon does well to change direction and parry the effort. Keane latches onto the ball and pings it back across the face of goal from a tight angle on the left, but Gordon is alert and clears the danger.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> Sunderland make their first change of the evening. Roy Keane replaces his new midfield man Tainio with club captain Dean Whitehead.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Gerrard wastes Liverpool's best chance of the match so far. Alonso flicks the ball in the centre to Benayoun, who is freed to advance on the Sunderland area. He slips the ball out right to Gerrard, free in acres, but the Liverpool captain's shot is dragged across the face of goal and inexcusably low on pace. A terrible scuff, but Liverpool are playing better. Not a lot better, but trees don't immediately spring out of acorns like a jack in the box, do they.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> Robbie Keane cost 20 million pounds. \u00a320m!</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> It's an awful lot of puff and bluster at present. \"Dear God,\" begins Matt Nosurname (who starts it thus because he's about to go off on one, it isn't an open letter to Robbie Fowler), \"I am watching this in Hong Kong at 1.45 am and the last 60 minutes I could have been getting a good night's rest instead of watching this debacle. Why does he stick with Kuyt? Why cant they pass the ball to each other? Why am I still awake?\"</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>67 min:</strong> Sunderland aren't any great shakes themselves at the moment. This has turned into a very poor game, which is a shame because it started quite brightly.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> Liverpool are enjoying all the possession. They stroke it around for a good minute or so before the clumsy Chimbonda sweeps Benayoun onto the ground right on the edge of the area, to the left of the D. Gerrard stands over the ball and hammers it into the wall in the hopeless fashion. Ah.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>72 min: THE DICTIONARY DEFINITION OF HAPLESS. OR PERHAPS USELESS.</strong> Kuyt takes a low shot which Gordon can't handle. He spills it into the path of Torres, who dinks towards the goal - but can't get it past Keane, who is also scooting in for a piece of the action. It hits his own man. \u00a320m. Dear lord.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Carlos Edwards replaces Malbranque, who gets a decent ovation from his new fans.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> I wouldn't say this game is one for the neutral. \"Alonso suffers from Ledley King Syndrome,\" suggests Niall Mullen. \"Nothing becomes him like not playing. But when he steps onto the pitch he is alright, no more, no less. He hasn't been the same player since Fat Frank broke his ankle. Also if his replacement was, say, David Silva, how much bleating would we hear?\"</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Nabil El Zhar replaces Keane, who at \u00a320m-plus has been more of a hindrance than a help.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>80 min: ALONSO TRIES TO SCORE FROM INSIDE HIS OWN HALF.</strong> He doesn't quite manage it, but what an effort; it floats just wide right of goal and a wee bit too high. Magnificent stuff. Gordon untangles himself from the net with a sheepish but relieved look on his face.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Michael Chopra comes on for Diouf.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>83 min: GOAL!!! Sunderland 0-1 Liverpool.</strong> This came straight out of nothing. Torres picks the ball up in the middle of Sunderland's half, prods it forward a couple of times, and unleashes a majestic low drive into the bottom left corner. Gordon could have reached it in terms of position, but the pace was too much to deal with. An absolute hammer of a shot.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> If Liverpool get away with this it will be robbery, because while they've had all the possession, they have played utterly abysmally. Still, if you can get the results when you're playing badly, and all that... although that maxim only stands up if more often than not you actually play well.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Kuyt simply is not good enough. Alonso strides down the centre of the park and rolls a perfect ball to the Dutch striker's feet in the area. It's not quite Pele to Carlos Alberto, but it's more than good enough for Kuyt not to break stride and hammer a shot on goal, but he decides to trap, check, and slip the ball inside to the advancing El Zhar. Have a pop, man! You're supposed to be a striker!</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> El Zhar is booked for fannying around.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>90 min +1:</strong> Arbeloa tries his level best to recreate the Riise goal - yes, <em>that</em> Riise goal - with a preposterous header in his own area. Happily for him, it spoons up and away from goal. Richardson attempts to get a cross in but Reina - who has had nothing to do all half - collects calmly.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>AND THAT'S IT!!! Sunderland 0-1 Liverpool.</strong> A terrible display from Liverpool, a not-much-better one from the hosts. If a winner had to come from anyone, it was only ever going to be Torres. Indeed he would have got two had an earlier shot not been intercepted by \u00a320m Robbie Keane rolling in front of goal like a boulder in an Indiana Jones movie.</p>",

OK thats USA 1 GB 0.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>5.08am: </strong> <strong>Swimming </strong>\"It was very clear there was no doubt whatsoever that first arrival was Michael Phelps,\" FINA executive director Cornel Marculescu told reporters after a review of the race, which the American won by 0.01 second.<br>\"The Serbs were satisfied and agree with the comments of the referee.\"</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>5.09am: </strong><strong>Women's 400m</strong> The heats are about to get underway. Both Christine Ohuruogu and Nicola Sanders are in with a chance of a medal.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>5.13am: </strong><strong>Women's 400m </strong>Potential shock. Deedee Trotter ambled round the track, eventually finishing fourth. She may sneak through as a fastest loser.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>5.19am: </strong><strong>Badminton</strong> Maria Kristin Yulianti of Indonesia beat Lu Lan of China 11-21 21-13 21-15</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>5.21am: </strong>More bad news for China, Zhang Penghui has been disqualified from the Olympic <strong>men's 25m rapid fire pistol</strong> competition. The reason: he raised his arm to much on three occasions.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>5.27am: </strong><strong>Women's 400m </strong>Lee McConnell qualifies for the next round. She made it look very easy, a nice relaxed run.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>5.28am: </strong>Elena Isinbaeva makes <strong>Pole Vaulting</strong> look so easy; I'm even thinking about limbering up for London 2012. Meanwhile, Kate Dennison wasn't so impressive she failed to get over 4.50m, but that's her best outdoors this season.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>5.32am: </strong><strong>Women's 400m</strong> Christine Ohuruogu ran-down Yulia Gushchina to win her heat very easily.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>5.35am: </strong>I need some verification on a bit of pub quiz trivia. Is it true that the <strong>discus</strong> is the only event where the women's world record is better than the men's? Answers on a postcard please.....</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>5.40am: </strong>You know I mentioned the <strong>men's 25m rapid fire pistol</strong> well it's been won by Oleksandr Petriv (Ukraine) who scored 780.2 points.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>5.42am: </strong><strong>Sanya Richards</strong> is looking in ominous form. Don't forget she missed the World Championships last year. She made that race look like a gentle jog around Finsbury Park. No problems for <strong>Nicola Sanders</strong> either. Job done for the GB girls.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>5.49am: </strong>So my discus factoid is half true. Jim Graham says: \"The women's discuss is 1 kilo, compared to the men's, which is 2 kilos. The men's discuss is also bigger in circumference. So, the records really have no relation to one another.\"</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>5.53am: </strong>I can't believe it, with all the excitement in the pool and on the track I've totally forgotten about the <strong>softball</strong>. Japan v China and USA v Chinese Taipei. What the heck has happened? Also if anyone is watching any of the so-called \"smaller sports\" that the Beeb deems not worthy of coverage let me know.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>6.00am: </strong> It's been a big big morning. Here's what you missed out on. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/16/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics3\">Brilliant Adlington wins second gold</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/16/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics2\">Phelps wins seventh gold of the Beijing Games... just</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/16/olympics2008.olympicsathletics3\">Sotherton falls to fifth after failing to take off in the long jump</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/16/athletics.christineohuruogu\">British trio cruise through 400m opening round</a> and the '<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/16/olympicsandthemedia.spain\">Affectionate gesture' that sparked a global storm</a>.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>6.08am: </strong> Our friend Andrew Jolley has come up with the goods again. Apparently Japan are beating China 3-0 in the softball and, for good measure, he's thrown in a volleyball score, Serbia are one set up and are also leading Germany 10-6 in the second.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>6.14am: </strong><strong>Softball </strong>update, Jim Graham says the USA are now 5-0 up against Chinese Taipei.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>6.27am: </strong>Andrew Jolley says: \"Japan did beat China in the softball 3-0, and Serbia have just taken the second set 27-25 against Germany in the best of 3 contest. It being 20 degrees in the middle of winter here in Brisbane, I'm off to get an ice-cream.\"<br><em>I want some ice-cream, although i'd probably settle for coffee and toast.</em></p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>6.30am: </strong>We're all missing a trick here, everyone one of us should have tuned in the trampolining. I didn't even realise it was an Olympic event. Apparently the athletes were stunned by the size of the crowd: \"We don't get anything like this at home,\" said Canada's Rosannagh MacLennan.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>6.35am:</strong> If beeb commentator Andy Jameson had his way, instead of shaking hands, we'd all go around saluting each other. I lost count of the times he demanded we all raise three fingers to our cranium during Rebecca Adlington's gold medal swim.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>6.38am: </strong>Never accuse me of not having my finger on the Olympic pulse. Australia have just beaten European Champions Russia in the men's basketball. The Russians could possibly be heading out of the competition. Bit of a shock. (Thanks Joanna).</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>6.46am: </strong> Bit of Brit interest for all <strong>flyweight</strong> Khalid Yafai takes on Andris Hernandez Laffita. Guess where he's from: Cuba. Oh dear that means he's bound to be good.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>6.49am: </strong> News from water polo. Germany have edged past Italy 8-7 and the USA have beaten Croatia 7-5. Did anybody watch? Were they good, bad or indifferent?</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>6.54am: </strong> Andrew Jolley knows the Guardian website better than me, he's just pointed out this excellent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/interactive/2008/aug/16/beijingolympics2008\">guide to trampolining</a>.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>6.59am: </strong><strong> Boxing</strong>Khalid Yafai is getting a bit of a boxing lesson at the hands of the Cuban. How do they keep turning out such great fighters? Castro must be putting something in the water.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>7.01am: </strong><strong>Boxing </strong>Khalid Yafai has been beaten 9-3 by Andris Hernandez Laffita, another one of our boxers bites the dust.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>7.02am: </strong>Today isn't just Super Saturday at the Olympics, it's also the start of the Premiership season, and on that note, David Bartram says: \"Thank god the Premier League starts today. I've had enough of watching sportsmen from obscure nations outshining Brits. Oh wait...\"</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>7.07am: </strong><strong>Shooting </strong>Bad news for anyone thing of taking up the <strong>25-meter rapid-fire pistol</strong> for London 2012. Silver medalist Ralf Schumann won't be retiring any time soon. \"I will go to London (for the 2012 Olympics),\" he said. Schumann finished second behind Oleksandr Petriv of Ukraine.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>7.12am: </strong><strong>Injury update</strong> Germany defender Linda Bresonik is out of the Olympics after she tore an ankle ligament in the team's quarterfinal victory over Norway.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>7.15am: </strong><strong>Basketball</strong> Poor old Angola, Ioannis Bourousis scored 22 points as Greece thrashed them 102-61. They look to be on their way out.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>7.20am: </strong><strong>Another Chinese gold medal</strong> Defending champion Zhang Ning of China won the gold medal in women's singles in the Olympic badminton tournament Saturday, defeating team-mate Xie Xingfang in three sets. She won 21-12, 10-21, 21-18.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>7.26am: </strong>Right that's me checking out of this mad house. Paolo Bandini is going to take you through the next few hours of action that will include: sailing, rowing and possibly some tennis. Right adios.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>7.33am:</strong> Hello. I'm watching a couple of <strong>very slow sailboats</strong> bobbing along gently on the water outside Qingdao. Ben Ainslie is apparently doing an \"excellent\" job of marking his only rival for the gold medal - America's Zach Railey. Which as far as I can discern means getting in Railey's way and copying <em>absolutely everything</em> he does. Ainslie needs to finish within six places of Railey to win gold, which doesn't look like it's going to be a problem, though it's early doors yet.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>7.38am:</strong> Let's look at the agenda for the next few hours, then, and it seems like I may have arrived just in time for ... er ... a bit of a lull. Ainslie is going now, of course, but other than him, there's no British medal chasing till 8.50am BST, when Alan Campbell is in the final of the men's single sculls. Lots of rowing finals in quick succession after that though, with the women's pair, women's double sculls, men's double sculls and men's coxless four all to be decided. We've also got James Degale up in the boxing at 9.15am, then the cycling gets going, with Chris Newton in the men's points race final at 10.40am and Bradley Wiggins chasing gold in the individual pursuit an hour and a quarter later.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>7.44am:</strong> \"It's golden Saturday,\" yelps a slightly overexcited Clare Balding as Ainslie maintains his comfortable domination of America's Railey in the Finn Class <strong>sailing</strong>. In the meantime let me know which you are most excited about out of the men's basketball preliminary between Croatia and Lithuania, the men's handball preliminary between France and Spain or the men's table tennis semi-final between Japan and Germany and I'll try to give you some bonus updates*.</p> <p>* theguardian.com reserves the right to ignore your views.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>7.51am:</strong> Gary Naylor's here, and he's quoting me. \"You say 'Ainslie needs to finish within six places of Railey to win gold, which doesn't look like it's going to be a problem' (7.33am). Do you mean it will be 'plain sailing'?\" You're better than that Gary.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>7.55am:</strong> Am I the only one who's marginally uncomfortable about the BBC's repeated insistence on referring to this as a \"golden day\" for Britain? I mean I do realise that the one medal we've won already is above par, and we <em>probably</em> will win a bunch more, but <em>really</em> - are we cocky enough about anything Olympic related to take winning medals for granted?</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>7.59am:</strong> \"Dramatic scenes!\" scream our commentary team as they cut to LIVE images of a small boat not moving. Apparently the Finn class medal race has been abandoned due to a lack of wind, meaning Ainslie, who basically had the gold in hand, now has to do it all over again. It could be later today, or it could be even later than that, depending on the weather.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>8.03am:</strong> This really isn't what I was asking for (at 7.44am) but Andrew Jolly seems intent on doing my job for me. \"I can cover the Lithuania v Croatia basketball and Australia v Holland in the women's hockey as that's all there is on offer on Australian TV this afternoon,\" he chimes. \"It's 1-1 in the hockey at the start of the 2nd half and Croatia 23-17 Lithuania in the basketball.\"</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>8.11am: It's a Golden Day!</strong> Nobody's won anything in the last eight minutes, but let's be honest, I was wrong at 7.44am, <strong>it is a golden day</strong> for Britain. We've been discussing this in the office, and we feel it may be necessary to play a little jingle every time Britain win gold. BBC's idents are already wearisome, while the national anthem and Spandau Ballet's Gold seem too obvious. Any other suggestions?</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>8.15am:</strong> \"I thought it was a golden day for Britain due to Hull City's first appearance in top flight football,\" pipes up Oliver Pattenden, moderately humorously.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>8.18am: rowing</strong> More good news for Britain - there's a lurgy going round the rowing regatta, and among the afflicted is German rower Marco Neumann, who has been forced to withdraw from the final of the men's four. Given that they Germany were among the favourites, this can <em>only</em> mean more gold for Britain. Probably.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>8.23am</strong> \"Yup, talking up the Golden Day can only end in tears,\" reckons Andrew Jolly. \"I know this because there have been a whole host of Australian swimmers who were meant to 'cruise home' in gold. They've been performing quite under par, which is of course, amusing, and provides me and others with much ammo for the office. They are of course, still miles ahead in the table.\" Pah - they're only one gold ahead. We'll be in front before elevenses ...</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>8.26am: sailing</strong> The guardian's man in Qingdao Steve Bierley says there's still some prospect of more wind later today, so there's a decent chance Ben Ainslie will get another shot at tying up his gold this afternoon.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>8.31am:</strong> New Zealand-based British rowing enthusiast Joanne Harris has more good news for team GB ... \"TVNZ is also treating today as a possible golden day, because there's the rowing and the cycling and Valerie Vili appears to be on good form in the shot put,\" she says. \"Basically NZ is now desperate to get on the medals table full stop. But Mahe Drysdale's got a funny tummy and is dehydrated, so that might not help the chances and Vili's the best bet at the moment.\" Drysdale's got a dicky tummy too, eh? That pretty much <em>guarantees</em> Britain's Alan Campbell gold in the men's single sculls.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>8.35am:</strong> \"But what happened in the <strong>trampolining</strong>,\" demands Frances Bentley. Britain's Claire Wright failed to qualify for the final of the women's competition, that's what.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>8.42am:</strong> Enough dawdling, it's time for facts. <br>\u2022Fact No1: The United States have whupped Taiwan 7-0 in a rounders preliminary.<br>\u2022Fact No2: Holland have crushed Australia 2-1 in the women's hockey. \"Apparently it was the crowd's fault,\" relays Andrew Jolly.<br>\u2022Fact No3: Rebecca Adlington is going to get an open-top bus tour around Mansfield to celebrate her two gold medals when she gets home. \"She has raised the profile of Mansfield and provides inspiration for other youngsters in the town,\" hurrahed the Mayor of Mansfield, Tony Egginton.<br>\u2022Fact No4: You really should read <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/16/do_we_really_have_to_learn_les.html\">Barney Ronay's blog asking whether we really need to learn lessons</a>, because it's rather good.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>8.48am:</strong> The men's single sculls is literally just 120 seconds away. I've just been informed that Lawrence Donegan will be blogging live from the Bird's Nest on all the big athletics - including the men's 100m final - from 1pm BST.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>8.51am: Whinging ... erm ... Kiwis</strong> There's been a delay after Drysdale complained that there was weed in his lane and it had to be removed.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>8.53am:</strong> Campbell's started well and is in the lead after 500m, Tim Meyens of Belgium is second ...</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>8.55am:</strong> ... Campbell's down to second after 1000m though - Olympic champion and favourite Olaf Tufte, from Norway, has taken first ...</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>8.57am:</strong> ... But it's Drysdale who leads after 1500m - he's setting a serious pace now and is almost a whole length clear of Tufte in second. Campbell is barely clinging onto third ...</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>8.58am:</strong> ... Yeah, Campbell's miles off the pace by the end and nowhere near the medals. His collapse was somewhat overshadowed by Drysdale, though, who seemed to go to pieces in the final 100m, when he went from leading comfortably to only just sneaking third. Tufte, who upped his stroke rate dramatically down the stretch, retains his Olympic title, while the Czech Republic's Ondrej Synek, who rowed a very patient race before also pushing on late, takes silver.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>9.02am: skeet shooting</strong> In amidst all that rowing excitement, I'm afraid I missed Vincent Hancock winning gold in the men's skeet shooting. Norway's Tore Brovold takes silver, and if I understand the official Beijing website right, then France's Anthony Terras got bronze.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>9.05am:</strong> \"Lithuania beat Croatia 86-73,\" relays Andrew Jolly. \"I don't normally like basketball, but I'll concede that this was quite good. The water polo, on the other hand, is utterly ridiculous as a spectator sport, just a load of hairy men splashing and spluttering all over the place.\"</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>9.10am:</strong> \"Can we not be too hard on Alan Campbell,\" implores Joanne Harris as the women's pair get ready to go. \"He had a knee infection not that long ago and to reach the final was an achievement - also, Britain hasn't had a decent single sculler for quite some time, and Campbell's the baby of the men's singles field at the moment. He actually is a real prospect for 2012, as rowers can go on for some time (evidence: Steve Redgrave!)\" Indeed, quite an infection Joanne - he missed six weeks of training in the build-up to this Olympics. Joanne also rightly points out that Drysdale has had to receive treatment after collapsing in his boat.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>9.12am:</strong> You were probably hoping for some more <strong>rowing</strong> news here, but you're getting <strong>sailing</strong> instead. Sadly both Ben Ainslie and the Yngling girls will now have to wait for tomorrow for their tilt at gold, as it's all been called off for the day due to adverse weather conditions. Sailing, incidentally, must be the only sport in the world where a total absence of wind constitutes \"adverse weather conditions\".</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>9.15am:</strong> Britain's Louisa Reeve and Olivia Whitlam are pootling along in fifth at the half-way mark of the women's pair. To be fair they were never expected to do much here ...</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>9.20am:</strong> Reeve and Whitlam just about sneak past the support tugboat on the line, but only because it stopped. A comfortable last place for Britain, with Romania's Georgeta Andrunache and Viorica Susanu taking gold, and China's You Wu and Yulan Gao putting in a huge effort to power past Belarus's Yuliya Bichyk and Natallia Helakh for silver with less than 50m to go.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>9.27am:</strong> Australia has beaten Russia 95-80 in the men's basketball. That's the sort of news you came here to hear.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>9.30am: cycling</strong> Steven Burke is up against Ukraine's Volodymyr Dyudya in the first round of the men's individual pursuit ...</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>9.32am: cycling</strong> ... and so far he's getting hammered. Dyudya's about two and a half seconds ahead ...</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>9.34am: cycling</strong> ... but Burke comes storming back - the gap's down to just over 0.1sec with one lap to go ...</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>9.35am: cycling</strong> ... and Burke's through to the last four with what I'm told is a personal best time. Brilliant stuff, and if Bradley Wiggins can do the same in his heat against Alexander Serov shortly, then Britain will be guaranteed at least one medal in the competition ...</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>9.39am:</strong> Debra Lee has composed a gold medal jingle to go with Team GB's <strong>golden day (number of gold medals won so far: 1)</strong>. \"Bill Withers may be 80 but I'm sure he's up for re-recording Lovely Day with revised lyrics,\" she offers - before launching into song: <br>\"Then I check results and the world's alright with me<br>Just who's won the gold, oh, I see it's Team GB -<br>A golden daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay<br>(Golden day, golden day, golden day, golden)<br>A golden daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay\"</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>9.42am:</strong> I've just had a request for an update on that men's table tennis, and I can tell you that Germany are currently 2-1 up in matches against Japan, with Christian Suss beating Yo Kan 1-0 in games and 8-5 in the second game of the fourth match as I type.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>9.47am: rowing</strong> Australia's Drew Ginn and Duncan Free have taken gold in the men's coxless pair. There were no Brits in the final, so no more crushing disappointment just yet.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>9.47am: boxing</strong> James Degale is through to the quarter-finals of the men's middleweight tournament after beating USA's Shawn Estrada 11-5 on points. He'll face Kazakhstan's Bakhtiyar Artayev next.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>9.52am: rowing</strong> And now we have Elise Laverick and Anna Bebington in the final of the women's double sculls. They're fourth and three seconds back on leaders Germany at the half-way mark. In fact they're apparently in \"fourth medal\" position according to the Beeb's commentators. What do we reckon that particular medal's made of, cheese (hard variety)?</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>9.57am: rowing</strong> ... the girls are still three seconds back but now third at the 1,500m mark ...</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>9.59am: rowing</strong> ... Aah - a frustrating <strong>bronze medal</strong> for Britain in the end - they battled right back into it, and had the race gone on another 50m probably would have won, but in the end were only about three feet back of Germany and New Zealand, who crossed the line at almost exactly the same moment. As yet we still don't know who actually won as it was too tight to call ...</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>10.01am: rowing</strong> New Zealand's Georgina and Caroline Evers-Swindell are deemed to have won by a hundredth of a second, meaning their first gold of the Games.</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>10.04am: cycling</strong> Meanwhile, Bradley Wiggins has beaten Serov in the individual pursuit. His time was the fastest in any of the four heats, so he will face New Zealand's Hayden Roulston, whose heat time was three seconds slower than his own, in the heats. Wiggins was 12-1 on favourite before this morning and he should fancy his chances now. Steven Burke's time was the third-fastest in the end, so he will face Russia's Alexei Markov in the bronze medal race.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>10.06am: cycling</strong> Chris Hoy has cruised through his heat in the men's keirin.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>10.10am: rowing</strong> We're back at the Shunyi rowing lake, where Matthew Wells and Stephen Rowbotham have a reasonable shot for gold in the men's double sculls</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>10.13am: rowing</strong> are second at the half-way mark, but Australia are pulling away and have already created clear water between themselves and the British crew ...</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>10.15am: rowing</strong> ... Australia's still have a gap of over two and a half seconds at 1,500m and I'd the Brits are looking more likely to lose silver - probably to Estonia - than gain gold ...</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>10.17am: rowing</strong> ... They say second place is first loser, which would make our crew second losers, I guess, as they are overhauled by Estonia right on the line. Yup, the golden day is going much as we expected.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>10.24am:</strong> \"So far the only golds the Aussies have won have been in the swimming and rowing,\" points out Bob O'Hara. \"It's almost as if they're desperately trying to get off their large island ... I hope they don't discover sailing.\" Meanwhile Britain's Ross Edgar has qualified from his heat in the men's <strong>keirin</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>10.30am:</strong> \"Bolt's going to run 9.5sec today,\" insists my colleague James Dart and 100m chitter-chatter has been dominating the desk all morning. Personally I still believe Tyrone Edgar's in with a shout*.</p> <p>* I do NOT believe this.</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>10.32am: rowing</strong> Right then, one last crack at gold on the Shunyi lake. Great Britain are second at the 500m mark in the men's fours ...</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>10.34am: rowing</strong> ... Team GB are third and about 1.4sec behind Australia at the half-way point. This is where Britain would expect to start kicking on ...</p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>10.35am: rowing</strong> ... still second at the 1,500m mark but the gap isn't closing so far ...</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>10.37am: rowing</strong> GOLD FOR BRITAIN! Raise your glasses, do a dance, play a jingle - Debra Lee's at 9.39am will do - the <strong>golden day</strong> is finally back on as Tom James, Andy Hodge, Pete Reed and Steve Williams heave their way past the Australians with 100m to spare.</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>10.41am: rowing</strong> Take that Russia! A fifth gold medal elevates Britain in the table from lowly ninth to a lofty eighth, leaving the Russians trailing in their wake. \"What's impressive is how the rowing coaches ride bikes along the towpath to observe the crews,\" parps Gary Naylor,\" yet, despite being close together and staring at boats and stopwatches instead of the road ahead, never collide nor, alas, ride into the lake.\" Those riders came up last time I was on MBM duty too, and I think we established there are some fans in that mix too - apparently they've been hiring out bikes for free by the rowing lake. Which I guess isn't so much hiring them out as giving them away, when you think about it.</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>10.48am</strong> How long does it take to give out a medal? Wells and Rowbotham are only just getting theirs, and they finished half an hour ago.</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>10.50am: cycling</strong> OK, maybe I can stop being facetious about the gold rush now - we've got an all-British final coming up in the women's 3000m individual pursuit after Wendy Houvenaghel and Rebecca Romero posted the two fastest times in the heats.</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>10.58am: cycling</strong> A few of you have emailed in to express concerns over the moped that leads the cyclists out on the first few laps of the keirin. Gary Naylor reminds us of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbwYLaJo0zs\">Alan Partridge's stringent views on this sort of cheating</a>.</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>11.08am: cycling</strong> Right, we've got the men's points race starting any moment now, where Britain's Chris Newton is up for a medal, but in the meantime I have <strong>huge news from the men's team table tennis</strong>, where Germany are through to the final after beating Japan 3-2. Judging by the footage on Eurosport, they're pretty happy about it too.</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>11.13am:</strong> Brazil just kicked off against Cameroon in the quarter-finals of the <strong>men's football</strong> and likewise Italy against Belgium. No goals in either as yet.</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>11.16am: cycling</strong> \"Good luck with the points race,\" offers Gary Naylor. \"I've watched a lot of bike racing, but I still have no idea what's happening.\" Oh, it's perfectly straightforward Gary. Basically they all pedal round this here velodrome, and they get points for ... er ... yes. America's Bobby Lea just did a full lap more than everyone and rejoined the main group, and therefore has 25 points. Britain's Chris Newton has two. Just 133 laps to go.</p> <!-- Block 134 --> <p><strong>11.21am: tennis</strong> The Williams sisters are a set down to the Ukraine's Bondarenko sisters in the women's doubles, but 4-2 up in the second set. Russia's Dinara Safina, meanwhile, has beaten China's Na Li in the women's singles, and will face compatriot Elena Dementieva, who beat another Russian - Vera Zvonareva - in the other semi-final.</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>11.28am: cycling</strong> Yup, just 100 laps to go in the points race and \"it's going to be very close\". This seems as good a time as any to make my excuses and leave, so here's Taimour Lay to carry you through to 1pm, after which Lawrence Donegan will be blogging live from the Bird's Nest. Thanks for all your emails.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>11.33am:</strong> Right, that's quite enough of Bandini's knee-jerk patriotism. Here's to an afternoon of British underachievement and detached cynicism.</p> <p>By the way, the men's points race is continuing on its merrily incomprehensible way. A shiny penny to anyone who emails in to explain the rules.</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>11.36am: Football</strong> Exciting things are happening in the quarter-final between Italy and Belgium. But I only know what John in Singapore tells me: ''It's now 1-1 with Belgium down to ten men after giving away a penalty. Italy scored to make it 1-0 but then belgium equalised with a very, very controversial header from a corner. It was cleared off the line but the ref said it went over. Very dodgy indeed.''</p> <p>Back to the compelling cycling on the BBC! Only 60 laps to go...</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>11.39am:</strong> Roy Keane emails from New Zealand with a not unreasonable question which I, erm, can't answer. ''How does a rider end up in negative points in this men's points race?'' Anyone?</p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>11.41am: Team GB Cycling</strong> Chris Newton is in a bronze medal position with 40-odd laps left. That much I know.</p> <!-- Block 140 --> <p><strong>11.43am: Things coming up </strong> Steven Burke is on next in the men's 4000m individual pursuit bronze medal race, with Bradley Wiggins in the gold race afterwards.</p> <p>The keirin second round, with Chris Hoy, is after the points race with the final at 12.20pm.</p> <p>The javelin round of the <strong>heptathlon</strong> starts at midday. Watch amazed as Kelly Sotherton sends the pointy stick <em>backwards</em> into the crowd.</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>11.45am: </strong> <strong>The points race explained.</strong> Andrew Jolly wonders what all the fuss is about. ''It's pretty simple. There are a load of laps, every 10 laps there is a sprint, where they give 5 points for the bike across the line first, down to 1 for 5th. If you go all the way around and catch the back of the pack, you get 20 points. The bloke with the most points wins.'' </p> <p>And, Roy, here's an answer to the negative points question. Again, from Mr Jolly. ''You get 20 points taken away if you drop a lap from the leaders.''</p> <p>I feel pretty small right now.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <strong>Newton is in second! </strong>(check out that exclamation mark as my own knee-jerk patriotism kicks in.....)</p> <!-- Block 142 --> <p><strong>11.49am: Football Football Football </strong> Italy are getting STUFFED by Belgium. Well, not stuffed. But, read on:</p> <p>''The Belgians are in dreamland according to the commentator,'' says John in Singapore. ''And why not? They've just gone 2-1 up in injury time at the end of the first half. I won't pretend to know who scored, mind you.''</p> <p>I have the full weight of the Guardian sports department behind me. I'll find that Belgian scorer.</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>11.50am: None of us know the scorer.</strong></p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>11.53am: </strong>Former Bluebells bassist Lawrence Donegan will be <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/16/athletics_live.html\">blogging live from the bird's nest</a> in Beijing from 1pm: follow all the athletics, including the men's 100m at 3.30pm.</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>11.55am: Team GB Cycling Bronze to Chris Newton </strong> Fair enough.</p> <!-- Block 146 --> <p><strong>11.59am: Chinese Pop-aganda: </strong> Want to hear the Olympic song that is sending <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/16/cctv_quickly_wears_out_its_wel.html\">Marina Hyde around the Beijing bend</a>? </p> <p>Well, I played it (for research purposes, you understand) before work this morning, fully prepared to reject its saccharine manipulation, but then ended up humming it all the way to Farringdon, a spring in my step, the Olympic spirit coursing through my veins. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XbIZqg4v7w\">Try it if you dare. </a></p> <!-- Block 147 --> <p><strong>12.01pm: </strong>''The Belgian who scored was Kevin Mirallas!'' emails an excited Joanna Sutherland. We are a global village. And I am the idiot.</p> <!-- Block 148 --> <p><strong>12.04pm: Team GB Keirin</strong> Chris Hoy is into the final.</p> <!-- Block 149 --> <p><strong>12.07pm: </strong> Andy Bull gets all <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/16/time_for_new_heroes_as_british.html\">voyeuristic at the rowing.</a></p> <!-- Block 150 --> <p><strong>12.12pm: Sotherton watch</strong> Kelly starts her javelin. She's 22 points off bronze in the heptathlon. This is her worst event. And it's ... a no throw! At least, that's what I think a cross and a red flag indicate. Not a great beginning. Just hurl it! Any old way will do.</p> <!-- Block 151 --> <p><strong>12.15pm:</strong> Another email from Joanna who obviously has a laptop and a budding ambition to take all our jobs: ''I'm writing from the Basketball arena in Beijing and coming up next is China v Germany (whoever loses is out of the competition - the locals are VERY nervous) followed by USA (USA!) v world champions Spain. It's a biggie and the venue is full of bloody media!''</p> <!-- Block 152 --> <p><strong>12.17am: Team GB Keirin</strong> Ros Edgar makes the final too. Bandini can't control himself and bellows ''GB Gold rush!'' across the newsroom. <strong>Britain</strong>. Is. <strong>Great</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 153 --> <p><strong>12.19am: Football</strong> Brazil v Cameroon. ''It's 0-0, nearly 60 minutes gone and it's not a great game,'' reports Andrew Jolly. And Cameroon are down to 10 men.</p> <p>''Does anyone care about Italy v Belgium?'' asks Singapore John. ''If they do they might like to know Rossi, the fella that used to play for Man Utd, just got booked for diving in the box when the keeper clearly had enough of his ankle to make you think he was trying to rob his boots. I can imagine some serious whining from the Italians if they lose this.''</p> <p>Some-time Italian Paolo Bandini applauds the dive: ''A pragmatic solution to a hopeless situation.''</p> <!-- Block 154 --> <p><strong>12.23pm: Team GB </strong> Newton is on the podium for his bronze. Joan Llaneras of Spain got gold in that points race by the way.</p> <!-- Block 155 --> <p><strong>12.25pm: Tennis</strong> Novak Djokovic has won the first set 6-3 against James Blake. The winner takes the bronze medal.</p> <!-- Block 156 --> <p><strong>12.26pm:</strong> <strong>Sotherton throws a javelin!</strong> She made a celebratory gesture just now that suggests it went forwards - as is the aim of the discipline.</p> <!-- Block 157 --> <p><strong>12.28pm: Team GB Cycling</strong> It's the individual men's pursuit. Stephen Burke is up against Alexei Markov of Russia for the bronze medal.</p> <!-- Block 158 --> <p><strong>12.30pm: Team GB Burke </strong> Markov is ahead. The 20 year-old from Lancashire needs to, er, pump those legs faster so that the bike moves quicker and so on.</p> <!-- Block 159 --> <p><strong>12.32pm: Cycling </strong> Burke is go! He's ahead.</p> <p>In her <strong>800m semi-final</strong>, Marilyn Okoro finishes 6th. Will that be enough to qualify?</p> <!-- Block 160 --> <p><strong>12.34pm:</strong> <strong>Bronze rush!</strong> Stephen Burke has won it. 4.20.947 is the time.</p> <p>And Bradley Wiggins is next in the gold medal race against the Kiwi Hayden Roulston. They're off.</p> <!-- Block 161 --> <p><strong>12.40pm:</strong> Wiggins looks like he's going to win it. He's 2 seconds clear.</p> <!-- Block 162 --> <p><strong><strong>12.41pm:</strong> Team GB Gold Individual pursuit</strong> Belgian-born Wiggins is an Olympic winner once again.</p> <!-- Block 163 --> <p><strong>12.43pm: Team GB Athletics</strong> <strong>Rush of disappointment</strong> In the women's 800m semis, it looks like Marilyn Okoro's 6th place won't be enough to qualify for the final. In the second heat, Jenny Meadows also came sixth.</p> <!-- Block 164 --> <p><strong>12.45pm: Tennis</strong> In the battle of the siblings, Serena and Venus Williams are into the final of the women's doubles after beating Ukraine's Alona and Kateryna Bondarenko 4-6, 6-4, 6-1.</p> <!-- Block 165 --> <p><strong>12.47pm: Egad, I wish I was watching the football</strong> John fills us in: \"The Italians win a second penalty and, against Belgian's substitute<br>keeper, it's......scored by Rossi. 2-2 with 20 minutes to go. The ten of Italy men will not lie down! But then shocking keeping lets Dan Welly, or whatever he's called, score his second and it's 3-2 to Belgium. And the ref has sent off the Italian keeper. Miralis, the Belgian striker, ran off with the ball and then threw it behind him right into the keeper's head (tough to tell if he meant it or not) at which point the Italian keeper wrestled him to the ground and saw red. 10 minutes to go and it's a blinder!''</p> <!-- Block 166 --> <p><strong>12.52pm: The obligatory softball update</strong> ''Having still not seen any of TEAM GBGBGB (say it fast enough and you get Bee Gees) in action in the velodrome courtesy of Australian State Television, I thought you might like to know the Aussie women's softball team have just beaten the Dutch.'' Thanks to Michelle Houtman, who claims to be ''suffering in Sydney''. From excitement?</p> <!-- Block 167 --> <p><strong><strong>12.54pm: </strong> Football </strong> Jolly intriguing: Cameroon hang on for extra time with 10 men against Brazil.</p> <!-- Block 168 --> <p><strong>12.57pm: The English Premier League begins - the world yawns?</strong> ''I was wondering if there was any indication of the Chinese organisers trying to overcome the fact that now the Premiership has started the Olympics will wither on the vine over here,'' writes Tom Stone. ''I am sure someone is still watching it but a quick walk down the street and a few cheeky glances into people's front rooms suggests that the majority of Brixton at least would rather watch Mark Lawrenson and Lee Dixon bickering over who will be relegated come May.''</p> <p>I wouldn't attempt cheeky glances at strangers in Brixton, Tom. That's brought me a lot of trouble in the past...</p> <!-- Block 169 --> <p><strong>1.00pm:</strong> Sotherton's vigorous celebrations just before were for a 37.66m effort - a modest throw but at least she didn't impale herself.</p> <!-- Block 170 --> <p><strong>1.02pm: Team GB keirin </strong>Edgar and Hoy start the final. More medals up for grabs here.</p> <!-- Block 171 --> <p><strong>1.04pm: GB GOLD A-HOY! </strong> One lap to go. Hoy led from the front. Edgar sneaked through to third.

I feel moderately excited and I'm not afraid to admit it.</p> <!-- Block 172 --> <p><strong>1.10pm:</strong> And on that golden bombshell, that's it for this minute-by-minute report.
