  "<p>Alan McGee is no meteorologist but, as he would no doubt testify, lightning can strike twice. In May 1993, at King Tut's Wah Wah Hut, a small music venue in the middle of Glasgow, the fast-talking founder of Creation Records chanced upon a quintet of menacing beer boys and, three songs into their bottom-of-the-bill set, declared them 'fucking brilliant'. The name of the band? Oasis. Thirteen years later, in the same Scottish club, McGee caught another group placed third on the bill. Glasvegas were a four-strong troupe, this time comprising cousins, one of whom, James Allan, played football for Falkirk, Gretna and Queen's Park. They were also, as McGee enthused in a Guardian blog, initiating 12 months of press hysteria, 'rockabilly neds playing a frenetic homage to Elvis, art punk and noise'. Which sounds absurd. It's not.</p> <p>And yet the Glaswegians - James (vocals), Rab Allan (guitar), Paul Donoghue (bass), Caroline McKay (drums) - should sound absurd, not least because they look like they've been styled by Mark Lamarr and taught to sing by the Proclaimers' Craig and Charlie Reid. On 'Daddy's Gone', last year's breakthrough single, which echoed Kevin Shields were he on good terms with Phil Spector and troubled by the concept of masculinity, Allan rebuked an absent dad in his coarse Scottish brogue, seemingly repulsed by men who disregard their offspring and singers whose delivery conceals their place of birth.</p> <p>It's the other Reids, however, Jim and William, the Jesus and Mary Chain's pugilistic siblings, whose influence on Glasvegas's debut is most marked. Like their fellow Scots, James Allan's crew are wall of sound adherents whose clothing runs the gamut from black to darker still. But where the Mary Chain were flagrant nihilists, at least in their original unruly incarnation, Glasvegas are intense young folk who ooze humanity. 'Flowers and Football Tops', the staggering opener, which combines staccato drums swiped from Psychocandy with the kind of 'ohh ohhs' perfected by the Clash, addresses the death of 15-year-old Kriss Donald, who was kidnapped near his home and murdered by five men. It is incredibly poignant, especially when, five minutes in, the guitars fall away and Allan, gently, croons, 'You are my sunshine, my only sunshine/ You make me happy when skies are grey'. Then there is 'Stabbed', wherein the quartet slow the tempo and confront the subject from which there is no respite. 'I'm gonna get stabbed,' says Allan, matter-of-factly, over a piano and a hint of background hiss. 'No cavalry could ever save me/ I'm gonna get stabbed.'</p> <p>Not that Glasvegas are solely concerned with the trials and tribulations that torment young men, astounding as their snapshots of contemporary Glasgow are. 'It's My Own Cheating Heart That Makes Me Cry' is a peerless exercise in self-admonishment in which Allan, his tongue loosened by a vat of beer, a feverish Joe Strummer at his vein-popping peak, apologises to his mum, bad-mouths ecstasy, alludes to Oasis ('What's the story, morning glory?') and recounts a playground taunt. 'Liar, liar, pants on fire,' sings Allan to himself, as if attempting to regain the innocence of youth. Either way, it's a theme that crops up again on 'Stabbed' ('Run, rabbit, run/ Run, rabbit, run'), while their debut single, 'Go Square Go!', bemoans the brutality particular to playgrounds, its 'here we fucking go' refrain both chilling and exciting.</p> <p>All of which has led McGee to label Glasvegas the most thrilling outfit since the Jesus and Mary Chain. Praise indeed but then these hard-nosed softies are unique and this, make no mistake, is their Definitely Maybe, the quintessential noise-pop set of the modern age.</p> <p><strong>Download</strong> 'It's My Own Cheating Heart That Makes Me Cry'; 'Flowers and Football Tops'</p>",
  "<p>Gingerly, I pick up the dead rabbit and stare into its unseeing eyes. 'I don't think I can do this, Woody,' I half sob. 'Yes you can. It's easy. Just like taking a romper suit off an unruly child,' Woody tells me. </p> <p>While the rest of the group quietly and stoically set about butchering their bunnies, I set about wailing, hyperventilating and making theatrical retching noises. I will spare those of a sensitive disposition the gory details. Suffice to say that it's a messy job, but after 10 minutes and lots of encouragement from Woody, the poor creature lies at my feet, headless, gutted and skinned. Hands trembling, I study my handiwork.</p> <p>'The first one's always the hardest,' says Jacky, a veteran of these courses. 'It gets easier.' I nod, and contemplate becoming a vegetarian.</p> <p>Ray Mears has a lot to answer for. The popularity of his TV programmes has spawned a small industry of courses offering instruction in the art of wilderness survival. In woodland clearings up and down the country, 'bushcraft' courses are springing up like wild mushrooms. </p> <p>Such courses were once the domain of macho types with a subscription to Survival magazine and a camouflage fetish, but as the subject has become prime-time TV viewing, so the offerings have diversified to appeal to a wider cross-section of people. </p> <p>There are family bushcraft holidays, wilderness weekends for women, and workshops where you can actually specialise in making an Iron Age axe. But perhaps the most popular courses of all are those dedicated to gathering and preparing wild food. </p> <p>As increasing numbers of self-styled wilderness gurus have jumped on the bushcraft bandwagon, quality control has become an issue. But Woody - real name Andy Wood - is the real thing. With an army background, he has led expeditions in all kinds of terrain from the Arctic to the Kalahari desert and spent extended periods of time working with indigenous peoples. </p> <p>Before setting up his company, Bushcraft Expeditions, he even worked as an instructor for Ray Mears himself. In short, he knows one end of an axe from the other, but there's nothing remotely macho about his demeanour. </p> <p>I am signed up on his two-day Seasonal Wild Edibles course, which takes place at Hooke Park, 350 acres of privately owned woodland in Dorset. The camp is surrounded by beech and spruce trees and, although it is just a 10-minute drive from the village of Beaminster, it feels suitably remote. </p> <p>There are seven of us in the group. Three men from Kent on a stag weekend, a couple who run a cheese shop in Cambridge, and a young guy who was given the course as a birthday present. There was supposed to be another couple, but they pulled out at the last minute. 'They probably saw the weather forecast,' says Woody as the rain starts to fall. </p> <p>Thankfully, preparing the rabbit is only a small (and non-compulsory) part of the course. The main focus is on identifying and foraging for wild plants. As we walk through the woods it's a revelation to discover that plants and bushes I would have dismissed as weeds or generic 'foliage' are a valuable source of nutrients or useful flavourings to add to your dish. We pick wood sorrel, which looks like clover and tastes of apple skins, and wild garlic, easily identifiable by its aroma. </p> <p>At one point Woody gets down on his hands and knees and digs around in the soil, up to his elbows in mud. After five minutes he triumphantly pulls a nut the size of a marble from the ground. It's a pig nut, so called because wild boars love them, and it's surprisingly tasty - unlike the root of the burdock plant, which though a useful source of starch and fibre in a survival situation, tastes of absolutely nothing. 'Not a show-stopper is it,' observes Woody with admirable understatement. </p> <p>That evening we cook food that we have brought from home around the campfire as the rain falls softly on the tarpaulin above us. The couple from Cambridge have brought a selection of cheeses from their shop and we enjoy an impromptu tasting. Pig nuts and nettles are all very well, but you can't beat a bit of ripe brie and a glass of red wine, I think to myself as I happily stumble back to my tent in the dark.</p> <p>Next morning we are joined by Georgie Corrywright, a herbalist who lives in a house nearby in the woods. She takes us on a fascinating tour of the forest, telling us about the medicinal properties of the plants growing here. </p> <p>We learn that woodsage is good for bringing on a sweat and that meadowsweet is the herbal equivalent of Rennies. We pick nettles (a good all-round tonic) and take them back to camp to make tea. Georgie explains to us that it is important to gather plants when they are still in their growth stage, as that is when they are most full of nutrients.</p> <p>The big test of our new-found skills comes at lunch on the final day, a meal that will consist entirely - so the theory goes - of food we have caught or gathered ourselves. </p> <p>Ross Bowyer, Woody's fellow instructor, shows us how to make an impromptu fishing rod by whittling a branch taken from an ash tree. Once we have pared off the outer layer of rough bark, creating a smooth surface that the fishing line can be wound around, we attach a weight and head for the lake. Ross shows us how to cast our lines into the water and then we simply wait.</p> <p>I find it hard to believe that any self-respecting fish would be enticed by my home-spun rod with its sweetcorn bait and I'm mentally preparing myself for a lunch of dandelion leaves when I feel a sharp tug on the line. </p> <p>Much to everyone's amazement, I seem to have caught a fish. It's a lovely big shiny rainbow trout. Ross takes it off the hook and tells me to kill it by hitting it sharply with my fist on the back of its head. A couple of feeble attempts fail to do the trick so, in a state of sheer panic, I put it on the ground and kick it. Unorthodox maybe, but it seems to have the desired effect.</p> <p>Having been shown how to gut and clean my fish (a piece of cake after the rabbit horror), I stuff it with wild garlic and sorrel and fry it in a pan over the campfire and serve it on a bed of dandelion leaves. Foraging and fishing may be time-consuming, but is far more rewarding than a trip to the supermarket. I don't think I've ever enjoyed any meal more.

  "<p>The Lazarus Project is a remarkable book in its own right but one fact about its author keeps rushing from the background to take centre stage - that 15 years ago Aleksandar Hemon had only basic English. To have acquired as an adult the mastery required to publish literary fiction puts him in the same boat as Joseph Conrad, but oh how he rows it! With Conrad there's always the sense of someone inching warily over his own prose, anxious about whether it will hold his weight, while Hemon steps out fearlessly. He feels free to invent or extend words ('he unsmiled'), so that the narrator sees 'clouds and cloudettes' bunching up over a distant hill, and describes the armpits of his neighbour on a bus as 'onionesque'. Sometimes he seems to be working through all the possibilities of a relatively unusual Latin root - 'calenture', 'incalescent' - but his ear doesn't let him down. </p> <p>The few mistakes ('what rents it asunder', 'through the door ajar') are almost worth having, as a reminder of the distance travelled. Vocabulary and grammar are only two of the elements involved anyway, and it's as a phrase-maker and shaper of cadence that Hemon really shines. Take a sentence like this: 'The girlfriend was a comely young woman in a short, glittery skirt utterly unbefitting the idyllic catastrophe of the village.' The slightly old-fashioned choice of words seems risky all the way to 'idyllic catastrophe', incompatible strangers put hand in hand by a matchmaker who knows how to make verbal marriages work. Nabokov (whose own English dated from early childhood) would hardly have sneered. </p> <p>Hemon's narrator, Vladimir Brik, is (like the author) a Bosnian who arrived in Chicago in 1992, thereby missing the national trauma of the war and the siege of his home city, Sarajevo. Brik undertakes to write a book about the case of Lazarus Averbuch, a young Jewish immigrant from what is now Moldova, who called at the house of Chicago's chief of police in 1908 and was shot dead. Hemon interleaves polyphonic historical reconstruction - slipping, for instance, into newspaperese as well as the minds of historical characters - with an account of Brik's research trip to the places of Averbuch's origin (and, later, his own past), accompanied by his photographer friend Rora. The effect is rarely confusing, even when Hemon alternates paragraphs from the different levels of the book. </p> <p>Photographs, some from the Chicago Historical Society and some taken by Velibor Bozovic, reproduced against a black background, seem to converge stylistically in a way that destabilises the separateness of past and present. There's a similar artificial seepage at work in the prose, so that, for instance, the name of the assistant chief of police in 1908, Schuettler, is given to the Chicago philanthropist who funds Brik's research (real-life funding for the book was provided by the more august names of Guggenheim and MacArthur). This is normally a postmodernist tactic, but it's just as likely that Hemon enjoys undermining the solidity of his own fiction, just to show how robust it is, even so. The book contains plenty of formal self-unravelling of a more serious sort. There is no shortage of objections to any project of historical fiction - in his acknowledgements Hemon credits one source for 'more than the basic facts of the Lazarus affair', before adding 'to the extent that there are any facts in a work of fiction'. A historical novel is a story, and what do we expect from a story? In Brik's experience, Bosnians want brio above everything, while Americans want the truth, or think they do until they've heard it. Hemon obliges on both levels.</p> <p>The gentile Brik, researching a Jewish past, can hardly expect to connect with it: 'The two of us who could never have experienced the pogrom went to the Chisinau Jewish Community Center to find someone who had never experienced it and would tell us about it.' It's possible to be haunted by other people's ghosts as well as your own, but presumably Aleksandar Hemon, having planned the book to appear in the centenary year of Averbuch's death, is pleased to have it coincide also with the arrest of Radovan Karadzic.</p> <p>Any recreation of the past is a sort of Lazarus project, but what about the original one? What were the motives of 'Mr Christ' in that case? In Hemon's take on the world, the resurrected man is a special kind of immigrant.</p> <p>Immigration is his deepest subject and brings out his most brilliant writing. But the immigrant can't really go back, even if Brik, having had the experience of his own Bosnian-ness melting into everyone else's, can't imagine leaving Sarajevo again. This is an oddly forced end point for a remarkably unforced book. Why? Because an acquired language isn't a home, exactly, but (inhabited at this depth) it's something like one. The man who can describe someone as having 'no front teeth apart from a pair of incisor goalposts', in a language he mastered late in life, has knitted himself a new umbilical cord and a new belonging.</p>",
  "<p>Thousands of householders who have seen their fuel bills rise could be missing out on money to help them improve the energy efficiency of their homes.</p> <p>A government initiative, the 'Carbon Emission Reduction Target' (Cert), a home-insulation programme funded by energy companies, was launched in April. Under it, the companies must offer grants to enable householders to make their homes more energy efficient in order to hit carbon emission reduction targets. </p> <p>Cert spending is expected to reach \u00a33bn over the next three years. Forty per cent of the money has been ring-fenced for the over-seventies and vulnerable households in receipt of qualifying income benefits, but the bulk is aimed at all other householders, and very few have taken it up. </p> <p>In London, for example, British Gas runs a DIY insulation offer on behalf of the office of Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London. It runs until the end of the year and provides DIY loft insulation for \u00a399. There is \u00a350 cashback available once the insulation has been delivered and payment received. </p> <p>EDF Energy is offering free cavity wall and loft insulation for homes to customers on qualifying benefits and for people over 70. A discounted rate of \u00a3199 for loft insulation and \u00a3199 for cavity-wall insulation is available for others. And independent company Affordable Energy has an offer running until the end of the year for loft insulation (including two water tanks and 15 metres of pipework) from \u00a3189 - or free to recipients of qualifying benefits. This compares to the typical standard cost of \u00a3400 for flats and houses built before 1976 and \u00a3500 and detached and semi-detached houses and bungalows built after 1976. Most companies will also offer discounts on energy-saving products and some will give out free energy-efficient light bulbs.</p> <p>'The grants and discounts available are different depending on where householders live, but there is something available for everyone,' says a spokesman for the Energy Saving Trust, a non-profit organisation that provides free impartial advice. </p> <p>The best way for householders to find out what is available in their area is by contacting their energy supplier or going on to the Energy Saving Trust website, which has a section entitled 'Search for grants and offers'. It is worth noting that you don't have to be a customer of a specific energy supplier to receive free or discounted insulation or other energy-saving measures from them.</p> <p>Last Sunday, The Observer revealed how the government wants energy companies to redirect a chunk of the \u00a33bn they must spend under the Cert programme towards fuel-poor households. On top of Cert, another initiative, called Warm Front, is directed specifically at vulnerable households and those on benefits.</p> <p>This is a government-funded initiative managed by Eaga, a Newcastle-based green support services company. The Warm Front grant provides a package of insulation and heating improvements up to the value of \u00a32,700 for those on benefits. Eaga estimates that there are around seven million people eligible for the scheme but that since its inception in 2000 only 1.7 million households have taken it up. </p> <p>Anyone over the age of 60 in receipt of income support, council tax benefit, housing benefit, jobseekers allowance (income-based) or pension credit qualifies. So do householders with a child under 16, or pregnant women with maternity certificate MAT-B1 in receipt of one or more of the same benefits. Some other households on these benefits, or who receive disability living allowance and a small range of other allowances, may also qualify. </p> <p>An energy assessor will visit eligible households and recommend measures that could be carried out by the householders themselves and also discuss what would be available under the Warm Front scheme. Improvements paid for by the scheme include loft insulation, draught-proofing, cavity-wall insulation, hot water tank insulation and gas, electric or oil central heating. </p> <p>Edward Hardy from Lowestoft in Suffolk is one of the 1.7 million to have benefited from the Warm Front scheme. He is severely disabled from a car crash and in receipt of disability living allowance. He says he had no idea about the scheme until his support worker mentioned it. </p> <p>'I was suspicious at first and thought it was a loan I had to pay back,' he says. 'I was so pleased when I found I was entitled to \u00a32,700.' He had central heating installed throughout his house, an improvement which he says has made a huge difference to his life.</p> <p>'I had two small gas fires before, one in the bedroom and one in the front room. The one in the bedroom was barely heating the room up, so I used to stay downstairs and run in and out of the kitchen and bathroom because they were so cold.'</p> <p>Other initiatives that can save householders money on home improvements include the Low Carbon Buildings Programme, which offers grants of up to \u00a32,500 for installation of renewable technologies and is open to householders across the UK. There is also the Scottish Community and Householders Renewable Initiative, which provides grants of up to \u00a34,000 for installation of renewable technologies.

Dave Atkin from Eaga, the company that carries out the assessments on behalf of the government, came to my flat last week to demonstrate.</p> <p>He first measured each room and fed the results into a computer, which then calculated the area in need of heating and came up with an energy rating for the property. Mine has sash windows, but I live in a conservation area so double glazing is not an option. Dave suggested I could get secondary glazing fitted and should draughtproof all doors and windows, even those that don't open.</p> <p>He was unimpressed with my ancient boiler, but said he'd 'seen worse', and I got a tick in the box for having a room thermostat. He was more concerned about the condensation I have in the winter and told me to stop drying my clothes on the radiators and boiling water with the lid off the pan. He also suggested energy-efficient light bulbs, which can each knock about \u00a37 off the heating bill in a year.</p> <p>On a scale of 1 to 120, my energy rating was 64, which, amazingly, put my flat well above the UK average of 48. The government wants to raise the average to 65, which also the target for Warm Front-assisted properties - so there is obviously room for improvement at my place.</p> <p>You can carry out a basic energy efficiency assessment yourself online and for free by using the Energy Saving Trust's Home Energy Check at <a href=\"http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk\">www.energysavingtrust.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>A \u00a313bn overhaul of the NHS records system has suffered so many problems that hospitals have struggled to keep track of people requiring operations, patients with suspected MRSA and potential cancer sufferers needing urgent consultations.</p> <p>Glitches in the roll-out of the Connecting for Health computer system have also resulted in delays at accident and emergency departments, soaring complaints and failures to identify child-abuse victims.</p> <p>The revelations are just the latest setback for what the government has pledged will be a key factor in improving NHS services. According to the board minutes of the first London NHS trusts to install the new system, obtained by The Observer and Computer Weekly, it has had a serious effect on patient care, a problem that raises questions about its introduction to hundreds of other hospitals and trusts.</p> <p>A report to the Enfield Primary Care Trust in March reveals that difficulties with the system last year meant it did not have vital data identifying patients awaiting operations. As a result 63 patients of the Barnet and Chase Farm Hospitals NHS trust had their operations delayed.</p> <p>In April, the trust found that the system had failed to flag up possible child-abuse victims entering hospital to key staff, 'leaving the responsibility to the receptionist'.</p> <p>The same trust noted the following month that 272 elective operations were cancelled at the last minute for 'non-clinical reasons' and that 20 patients were not readmitted for treatment within 28 days at the end of last year because the 'surveillance system for tracking' them 'was not operational in the new ... system'.</p> <p>The board's minutes show 14,000 people contacted the trust last year with concerns about their treatment, compared with 5,500 in 2006.</p> <p>A report to the board of another NHS trust, Barts and the London, says that for six months to May this year the trust failed to meet targets for treating emergency patients within four hours, chiefly because staff were unfamiliar with the new computer system. The same report reveals that in May there were 'breaches of the two-week urgent cancer access guarantee' for the same reasons. As a result 11 patients who were suspected of having cancer did not receive consultations on time.</p> <p>According to minutes presented to the Buckinghamshire Hospitals NHS Trust, problems with the new system last year meant potentially infectious patients with MRSA were not isolated for up to 17 days. The problem had to be rectified manually by staff who updated the patient records themselves. 'This took approximately six weeks to do, during which time there was a possibility that some MRSA-positive patients may have slipped through undetected if medical notes had not been available,' according to the report.</p> <p>The revelations have prompted claims that the government is losing control of the flagship project. 'IT projects well implemented can be a huge benefit,' said Stephen O'Brien, the Conservatives' health spokesman. 'Clearly from the problems being encountered by many trusts, the benefits are not being achieved and all the risks are falling on patients.'</p> <p>Many trusts have delayed implementing the new system as a result of the problems and the chief executive of Connecting for Health, Richard Granger, resigned last year. Those trusts that have implemented the system complain it diverts staff from key duties. A report last month to the board of the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust said 12,000 patient records had to be manually amended over a three-week period.</p> <p>'The outpatient appointment centre has experienced a significant increase in the time taken to process individual patient appointment bookings. This has had a consequent and negative effect on call-answer performance,' the report states. The trusts said the problems had been or were being fixed. 'We are aware that during initials stages of implementation there were some difficulties,' said a spokesman for NHS London.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Connecting for Health said patients would be better off under the new system. 'Patients can expect faster diagnosis and treatment because vital information will be available wherever and whenever care is required.'</p>",
  "<p>Parents could be offered a seamless system of state-organised childcare from birth to school under proposals being discussed within the government in the battle to win parents' votes.</p> <p>Senior figures fear they have been wrong-footed by David Cameron's offer to promote marriage through the tax system. Steve Hilton, Cameron's adviser, has said privately that he plans to throw the party's best brains and most of its money at solving the problems of modern families as a priority.</p> <p>One cabinet source said the search was on for a rival 'big idea' on the family to boost Labour's manifesto, adding: 'I think it has to be universal childcare.'</p> <p>The Treasury is understood to have insisted that there is no money to expand childcare. However, MPs are looking beyond Gordon Brown's premiership in the debate about the next manifesto. One option is providing free nursery places from birth to school age for poor families, but requiring the better-off to pay for some services.</p> <p>Beverley Hughes, the Children's Minister, told The Observer that within 'two to three years' she expected local authorities to be plugging gaps in the current system, in accordance with a legal duty placed on them last year. Parents currently get a year's maternity leave to cover a child's first year and free nursery places for three and four-year-olds, but gaps still exist, most obviously for children between one and three, and during school holidays. </p> <p>'They now have their first assessments of what's available and what parents want and therefore where the gap is,' Hughes said. 'They are charged with working to meet that demand. It's not an absolute guarantee in law to every parent of what you want when you want it, but it's a right.'</p> <p>John Hutton, the Business Secretary, is also considering ways to help women to return to work after having children, including requiring employers to hold a woman's job open for her for a year. At present women have the right to return on the same terms after six months' leave, but if they take their full year's leave they can lose their old position if it is not deemed 'reasonably practicable' for them to resume it. </p> <p>Last week research from Cambridge University showed that Britons are increasingly likely to believe that family life suffers when mothers work full time. The findings will increase pressure from Tory rightwingers to champion stay-at-home mothers, while Labour argues that financially most mothers need to work.</p> <p>However, The Observer can reveal that Cameron's marriage pledge may not now lead to the straightforward tax breaks for couples that Tory traditionalists want, with discussions still raging in the shadow cabinet.</p> <p>Ideas such as reinstating a married couple's tax allowance or letting the husbands of non-working spouses take on their wife's unused tax allowance 'cost a lot and it would be wrong to say they are the only options', said one shadow minister. 'It's right that the Cameron commitment is going to be upheld, but not necessarily in the way people expect.'</p>",
  "<p>Protesters battled with police yesterday but failed to shut down Kingsnorth coal plant as the climax of the week-long climate camp ended with a series of skirmishes.</p> <p>Only a handful of protesters succeeded in getting inside the site near Rochester, Kent. Around 50 were arrested, bringing the total for the week to more than 90.</p> <p>Climate camp organisers said last night that about 1,500 people took part in the day of direct action and marches. They were matched by nearly 1,500 police officers. The only serious scuffles came when a group of 70 people tried to go into a cornfield. They were met by 100 police, some of whom used batons. Several people were injured. </p> <p>Police also used horses, dogs, trail bikes and helicopters to control demonstrators as they approached the power station across fields and down country lanes. </p> <p>Environmentalists are targeting Kingsnorth because they claim the new plant planned there by its owner, the German energy group E.on - the first for nearly 30 years - will usher in six more and make it almost impossible for the UK to meet its carbon emissions targets. </p> <p>Ten protesters commandeered crowd control barriers to scale the southern perimeter fence of the power station. Four people are believed to have crossed the marshy land between the fences and scaled the second, electrified security fence. They were immediately detained by police with dogs. </p> <p>Yesterday a climate camp spokeswoman claimed that more than 20 boats and rafts were launched on the River Medway despite a ban by Medway port authority. </p> <p>The police said that they removed 123 people from boats.</p> <p> 'Most did not get far, but two reached the power station and the crew of one also got over the perimeter fence,' said Madeleine, one of the protesters. 'It was a total success. We stopped any coal getting to the station and disrupted its operation. If the government gives the go ahead for a new plant, we will be back to stop it. This is not a symbolic protest.'</p> <p>While a minority tried to get into Kingsnorth, about 1,000 protesters, including many families with children, formed a carnival-like procession along the three miles from the camp to the plant's main gate. They arrived just before noon when the mood was dampened as it began to rain. Police and coastguard helicopters hovered over the area all day. </p> <p>A great cheer went up as a banner reading 'No new coal' was hoisted on the main gates of the power station. Five mock 'suspect: wanted' boards were also hung up on the gates, each with a silhouette and names of the five key people involved in plans to build the new plant: Energy Minister Malcolm Wicks, Business Secretary John Hutton, Gordon Brown and two E.on chiefs. </p> <p>About 150 police looked on behind crash barriers as speakers gave passionate addresses and protesters sat down for a picnic. Malcolm Hunter, from Leicester, who was dressed in an orang-utan suit, said: 'This protest is about raising awareness. Hopefully it will put pressure on government not to approve new coal plants.'</p> <p>Shortly before lunch, the sound system cranked up 'I've been loving you too long' by Otis Redding when a police helicopter circled and a loudspeaker announced: 'This is a police warning. Please disperse in 10 minutes or police horses, dogs and police batons will be used.'</p> <p>Organisers said that the protest had permission to remain outside the gate only until 1pm. Protesters packed up and turned back towards the camp without any trouble.</p> <p>Curious locals looked on as the action unfolded. Vic Mortley, 75, from Hoo village, who had served in the RAF, said: 'I don't want any part of the protest. We have lived with coal for 75 years. Are we aware of what coal is really doing - can we see the carbon emissions in the air?'</p> <p>Other locals were on the side of the protesters. Jo Barrett, from Stoke village, said: 'Opinions are roughly divided. There's plenty of water round here. There must be a cleaner way of generating electricity.'</p>",
  "<p>Even by City standards, it was a lavish affair. Some of the biggest names in mining were gathered in the opulent 17th-century Banqueting House in London's Whitehall in February. They were celebrating the recent successful float of ENRC, the Kazakh mining firm, and its imminent entry to the elite club of blue-chip companies, the FTSE 100. </p> <p>Ceiling frescoes by Rubens, commissioned by Charles I, looked down on the diners. A quartet of Kazakh violin players entertained the hundreds of bankers, fund managers and analysts as they tucked into their seven-course dinner. The credit crunch could not have seemed further away. </p> <p>During dessert, Ivan Glasenberg, chief executive of secretive commodities trader Glencore, rose to speak. To roars of laughter and the sound of fists banging on the tables in support, he thanked South Africa for contriving to almost double ENRC's share price in less than six months. The wave of power cuts in the country - which continue today - had crippled miners' operations, accentuating the global shortage of base metals and driving up their price. Rivals such as ENRC, not based in South Africa, gladly reaped the rewards. </p> <p>Brad Mills, the US chief executive of Lonmin, the world's third-largest platinum miner, could be excused for not sharing the joke. The South Africa-based firm has been one of the biggest losers in the power crisis, which has helped to slash its share price by half during one of the biggest commodity booms in history. </p> <p>Things became even worse last week. Late on Tuesday night, the day before Lonmin was due to announce its production report, Mills received an unexpected phone call from Mick Davis, the boss of rival Xstrata and a legendary deal-maker. Davis told him brusquely that he was going to make a hostile offer for the company. When Mills asked for details, he was told: 'You'll read about it tomorrow morning.' It was the first Mills had heard about it: there had been no prior discussions between the two sides. </p> <p>Next day, Xstrata unveiled its hostile \u00a35bn offer, pitched at \u00a333 a share in cash, a 42 per cent premium to Lonmin's closing price on Tuesday night. Lonmin rushed out a statement denouncing the offer as 'unwelcome' and 'opportunistic', but it seems that many of its long-suffering shareholders do not agree. On Wednesday night, Xstrata had snapped up 8 per cent of Lonmin's shares on the open market and, within 24 hours, that had reached 10 per cent. The next day, Thursday, Lonmin put out another statement, formally rejecting the offer, imploring shareholders to do the same and stressing that the group had bright prospects.</p> <p>Lonmin's optimism was not entirely borne out by last week's figures. In the nine months to June, platinum production slumped by 9 per cent on the same period last year, forcing the company to issue its fifth production downgrade in two years. It blamed the continuing power cuts, high levels of staff absenteeism, stoppages caused by safety issues and delays in deploying new hi-tech drilling vehicles, which are operated by remote control. </p> <p>To rub salt into the wound, Xstrata, which reported interim results the same day, showed earnings up 5 per cent to $4.8bn. </p> <p>Lonmin has a new management team in place, which it says will start to improve the company's performance at the end of the year. But Simon Toyne, an analyst from Numis, says that Lonmin faces a struggle to convince many shareholders that its turnaround plan will work: 'There is no immediate answer to Lonmin's operational weakness. It's been going on for quite a few quarters. To come out now and convince investors that there will be a significant improvement will be difficult, not helped by a further material downgrade with the third-quarter production data.'</p> <p>He also says there has been a worrying lack of development at its mines over the past year, despite platinum prices rising by about 50 per cent: 'How could it be that Lonmin was falling behind with development? It raised some questions about management.'</p> <p>In one respect, Mills is right: Davis's offer is opportunistic. It may be pitched at a big premium to last week's share price, but as recently as May, Lonmin shares were trading at \u00a335. Platinum prices have also recently dipped after reaching a record high the same month. </p> <p>But John Mothersole of analysts Global Insight argues that demand for it over the long run remains healthy. The precious metal is mainly used in cars' catalytic converters and jewellery. While the economic slowdown has hit car sales in the developed world, sales in the developing world are booming and next year will account for more than half of the global total for the first time, according to HSBC. </p> <p>Davis's timing is shrewd for another reason: a counterbid from a rival is unlikely. BHP Billiton is bogged down with its own hostile attempt to buy Rio Tinto, while the Russian owners of Norilsk Nickel, another potential buyer, are at war with each other. </p> <p>Lonmin has a chequered history. It used to be part of the sprawling industrial conglomerate Lonrho, run by the controversial 'Tiny' Rowland, which at one point even owned The Observer. Rowland's liberal use of bribes to secure oil and mining contracts in Africa led the Prime Minister at the time, Edward Heath, to brand the group as 'the unacceptable face of capitalism'. Lonmin was spun off from the group in 1998. </p> <p>On Friday, Lonmin shares closed at 3422p, so the market clearly expects a higher offer from Davis. The odds on it remaining independent don't look good.</p>",
  "<p>Nicola Brewer, chief executive of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, recently suggested that improved maternity benefits, entitling new mothers to a year's leave, have resulted in some bosses considering female staff a liability.</p> <p>But the problem could be worse than she suspects: changes to the Sex Discrimination Act, passed in April 2008, have created confusion over whether employers should maintain pension contributions during the entire 12-month period of maternity leave. Legal experts believe they should, but the government contradicts this view.</p> <p>The amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act made it discriminatory for employers to withdraw contractual non-cash benefits, such as medical insurance, mobile phones and company cars, during maternity leave for women whose babies are due to be born on or after 5 October 2008. </p> <p>Employees, both full- and part-time, who are pregnant or have just given birth, are entitled to a maximum of 39 weeks statutory maternity pay (SMP), regardless of whether they intend to return to work. However, to qualify, they must have worked for their employer for a continuous period of at least 26 weeks into the 15th week before the week the baby is due, and be earning an average of at least \u00a390 a week before tax.</p> <p>All employees are entitled to take an additional 13 weeks maternity leave but are not guaranteed any pay unless it says so in their contract of employment.</p> <p>However, while it is clear that non-cash benefits must now be continued throughout maternity leave, there is some controversy about how pension contributions should be treated. </p> <p>Catrin Young, a pensions specialist with solicitors TLT, says the confusion relates to the interpretation of the part of the Sex Discrimination Act that allows employers to stop paying remuneration during unpaid maternity leave: 'The act defines remuneration as \"benefits that consist of the payment of money to an employee by way of wages or salary\". The question, therefore, is whether pension contributions can be classed as wages/salary or benefits.</p> <p>'There are strong legal arguments that pension contributions are neither wages nor salary and are a benefit which should, therefore, be continued through the entire 52 weeks of maternity leave. If you were to ask the man on the street whether they considered their employer's pension contributions to be wages or a benefit, I'm sure the majority would consider it a benefit.'</p> <p>However, this is not the view of the government department responsible for maternity policy, the Department for Business, Enterprise &amp; Regulatory Reform (Berr), which says that pensions do count as remuneration. </p> <p>A spokesman for Berr says the changes will not affect pension costs: 'The changes relate to non-paid rights throughout maternity leave, which include benefits such as company cars, gym memberships or other work-related benefits. Pensions are considered a paid right. This means that when a woman is taking additional maternity leave, but is not being paid, the employer is not required to make pension payments for her during this time.'</p> <p>Simon Briault, deputy head of public affairs at the Federation of Small Businesses, acknowledges that extending maternity rights is in principle a good thing, but is concerned that small businesses are having to shoulder a disproportionate financial burden. He estimates that if companies do have to extend pension contributions for new mothers, it will cost them millions of pounds this year.</p> <p>'The government is continually increasing the financial burden on small businesses and it needs to provide more help,' he warns.</p> <p>Greg Campbell, a partner in the employment group at law firm Mishcon de Reya, agrees that the extension to maternity rights does represent an increased cost for employers, as 'they will have to continue to provide certain benefits that could previously be suspended during additional maternity leave and, unlike statutory maternity pay, this is a cost that comes entirely out of the employer's bank account'. He adds that the complexity of the legislation and the confusion it is causing could also expose employers to the added cost of litigation.</p> <p>TLT's Young agrees: 'Unless and until the Sex Discrimination Act is amended to explicitly state that pension contributions are remuneration, employers run the risk of claims for sex discrimination if they stop making pension contributions through unpaid maternity leave.</p> <p>'Ultimately, the uncertainty will continue until a case on the point is brought before the employment tribunals. Were that to happen, the tribunal could look to a line of case law in the European Court of Justice which supports the argument that accrual of pension under an occupational pension scheme is a benefit and not pay.'</p> <p>Until that time, employers are left with the difficult decision of choosing between taking the safe but expensive approach of amending their pension-scheme rules and employment policies, to ensure that pension benefits continue for the entire 52 weeks of maternity leave, or waiting for legal clarification and thereby risking a sex discrimination claim. </p> <p>It may be of little consolation to employers, but Zoe Lynch of law firm Sackers says the confusion could be eradicated by a further extension to statutory maternity pay: 'The promised extension of SMP to cover the whole of a woman's maternity leave [the full year] means that the issue as a whole may have a limited shelf-life - to the end of the current parliament, which is probably no more than a year.'</p> <h2>Jasmin's benefits</h2> <p>Jasmin Ahmad, 42, head of modern languages at an inner-London secondary school, is expecting her second child in the first week of November and plans to take a year's maternity leave.</p> <p>As she has agreed to return to work, her benefits are slightly better than SMP, which is paid for 39 weeks. If she fails to return, all contractual maternity pay must be repaid, though she could keep the SMP. If entitled to SMP, a woman can receive 90 per cent of her average earnings for the first six weeks, then up to \u00a3117.18 for the remaining 33 weeks. The last 13 weeks, if taken, are unpaid.</p> <p>'I made the decision to go part-time after my daughter was born. She is now three,' explains Jasmin. 'Having a family will inevitably lead to a drop in my income, even if my union has managed to negotiate better benefits than are available to many.'</p>",
  "<h2>Fighting talk</h2> <p>The fallout over the Edinburgh Comedy Festival continues. Eight days in, it's still the major topic of conversation among industry insiders, and while Fringe director Jon Morgan appears to be riding the storm over it, as well as continuing problems over ticketing, privately there is much speculation about his future. Tommy Sheppard, owner of the Stand comedy club (as far from the ECF's 'big four' venues - Assembly, Pleasance, Gilded Balloon and Underbelly - as you can get), is threatening to stand for election to the Fringe board, Morgan's employers. Perhaps Morgan should start schmoozing the local press, as one respected Scottish arts journalist told me: 'I have tried at least 10 times over the past two weeks to talk to Jon and the calls haven't been returned. If this was [his predecessor] Paul Gudgin, I would have had a half-hour of his time instantly.'</p> <h2>Funny money</h2> <p>There still is no sign of an Edinburgh Comedy Festival sponsor, something one would have expected to be in place before the festival was launched and which underlines the widespread view that it is a cynical marketing exercise to draw comedy fans away from smaller venues. Nica Burns, producer of if.comedy awards told me: 'I think the ECF was very badly launched because it excludes the vast majority of venues in Edinburgh, but it's a fait accompli. I strongly believe it shouldn't have Edinburgh in the title because it's not theirs to claim - why not something along the lines of Montreal's Just for Laughs?' My suggestion: how about Just for the Money?</p> <h2>The great unknown</h2> <p>Michael McIntyre may have sold his entire run at the Pleasance, but his television fame, as guest on various panel shows, has completely eluded some. On seeing the 'extra shows added' notice, one Edinburgh mother asked her teenage daughter who he was. 'Dunno,' came the utterly unbothered reply. Allow me to fill you in, ladies: Michael McIntyre is the rather pompous English comic who, on learning last year that he was not on the shortlist for the if.comedy award, harangued two judges for fully 20 minutes, saying this was a monstrous insult to his craft, to comedy and his legions of fans, and that he should have been - I quote - 'A shoo-in for the award'. Ah, but sadly you never were, Michael. Not even close.</p> <h2>Nothing like a dame</h2> <p>Grand-dame alert as Joan Rivers and Jill Gascoigne, both doing shows at the Fringe, had a jolly drink together at the Gilded Balloon's Loft Bar after the American had watched Gascoigne in the comedy play Sister Cities. The pair ensconced themselves and their girly whispering was punctuated by shrieks of laughter, while I was nearly flattened in the rush as every drag artist in town hotfooted it there to pay homage to the divas. Rivers, by the way, is never seen off stage without her hair and make-up artists in attendance. Now that's what I call a star.</p> <h2>Eminent artist</h2> <p>Overheard - an Edinburgh matron at the Tracey Emin exhibition at the National Gallery proclaiming: 'I think she must be a very dirty little madam.'</p> <h2>No timewasters, please</h2> <p>AL Kennedy richly deserved the Costa prize for her latest novel, Day, earlier this year, and I award her another plaudit for starting her stand-up show early (a Fringe first) at The Stand, causing me to make a late - that is, on-time - entrance. But how I wish I had been delayed for 60 minutes as ... how can I say this ... Kennedy is to comedy what Michael McIntyre is to humility. You owe me an hour of my life, Alison, and I'm claiming it back right here.</p> <h2>What a liberty</h2> <p>Producers of musical comedy On the Island of Aars (think about it) at the Pleasance were baffled when their show stopped being given the usual five-minute call for punters waiting in the Courtyard. Staff explained that somebody had complained. If that's upsetting Calvinist Dunedins, I suggest they do not go to Simon Stephens's Pornography at the Traverse, where septuagenarian actress Sheila Reid delivers an expletive-laden speech that would do Catherine Tate's Nan proud; nor An Audience with Mr Methane, a show about farting, at the Standing Order. And on no account should they go to the Jim Rose Circus, where a naked lady creates an artwork by shooting blue paint out of her fundament, and signs the canvas with a pen tucked up somewhere very near.</p> <h2>Mother love</h2> <p>Talented newcomer Tom Allen, the second-poshest comic on the Fringe (Miles Jupp just edges it), was handing out flyers for his show A Voyage Round My Mother at the Gilded Balloon, which contain an image of his mum's hand. 'It looks wizened!' a smartly dressed woman screamed at the mild-mannered Allen, who said he was rather offended by the comment. 'Well, she should use some moisturiser!' came the reply. Who knew Crabtree &amp; Evelyn did such aggressive marketing?</p> <h2>The voice of experience</h2> <p>The Scotsman, newspaper of record for festival-goers (after The Observer, of course), seems a tad crabbit, as they say north of the border, about the freesheets that sprout in Edinburgh during August, as evidenced by this chippy announcement: 'Our reviewing team is made up of professional critics with many years of experience. They are not students.' Guys, when you have to tell people how great you are ...</p>",
  "<p><strong>Wee Have Also Sound-Houses </strong>R3 </p> <p><strong>Forbidden Families </strong>R4 </p> <p><strong>Free Thought </strong>R3 </p> <p>I was looking forward to <strong>Wee Have Also Sound-Houses</strong>, Radio 3's Sunday Feature about Daphne Oram. Oram, who died in 2003, was a pioneer. As co-founder of the BBC's famed Radiophonic Workshop in the 1950s - it was Oram who gave us the sound of Dr Who's Tardis - she constructed a pre-computer environment dedicated to creating recorded electronic noise. 'A theatre of sound,' one interviewee called it. I'd have written down his name, but this documentary sped along at such a pace, I missed it. </p> <p>Although there were plenty of interesting contributions (I enjoyed the description of how Oram achieved the feeling of open sea for a drama called The Ocean: she distorted a clarinet note and combined it with the sound of her hand paddling in a washing-up bowl), ultimately, Wee Have Also Sound-Houses was frustrating listening. Too much background info rattled through at the start, presenter Robert Worby barely drawing breath between sentences. </p> <p>After about 15 minutes, things settled down and we learnt how Oram appeared 'prim and proper, beautifully spoken in smart, tailored clothes'. And how the BBC, worried about the effect that her unnatural sounds might have on its employees, brought in a rule forbidding anyone from working in her department for longer than six months without taking a break. Oram promptly left.</p> <p>Post-BBC, she lived in Kent, making soundtracks for advertisements and working on her pet project: the Oramics machine, a forerunner of the synthesiser. Oram envisaged the machine as being able to generate electronic sound that you controlled by drawing. Some chaps from Liverpool came to see it with a friend: someone thought they might have been Lennon, McCartney and Jagger, but Oram didn't bother to enquire. </p> <p>There was a lot in this programme, but it was badly organised and crammed in; a sludgy mish-mash instead of a glorious cacophony. The BBC ignored Oram's contribution for many years; now that it's trying to claim her back, it should do so properly.</p> <p><strong>Forbidden Families</strong>, a three-part series on Radio 4, opened with the story of Dhuoda, a Frenchwoman who, in 872AD, wrote a manual for the upbringing of her son, William, after he was sent away to the king's court. Not my cup of Perrier, as a topic, but this was expert documentary-making. Presenter Bettany Hughes gave a real feeling of place, and her producer was confident enough to let her talk French without translation. And the story, as it unfolded, was fascinating: William was handed over to court as a young teenager by his father - a political move. Dhuoda had another son, but he was removed 'so young, she hadn't even been able to give him a name'. </p> <p>Radio 3's <strong>Free Thought</strong>, every morning at around 8.30am, is a refreshing listen, especially when Germaine Greer is at the mic. She used her allotted two minutes to berate the British obsession with house-owning: 'the human right to struggle with life-long debt and compulsory DIY'. Why bother, she wondered, when all you own is a view of 'parked cars and the houses across the street'? 'The house is over!' she declared. </p> <p>The next morning, Stuart Maconie laid out his case against high and low culture - the idea that only worthy, difficult art is good, and everything light and charming is a so-called guilty pleasure. Both he and Greer were right, of course; and how exhilarating to hear their views over breakfast, instead of some dull Thought for the Day about whither God within today's society. Clue: he's everywhere, or nowhere, depending on your view.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The dilemma </strong> </p> <p>I have been going out with my partner for six months and every moment has been a delight. We have many things in common, not least our love of humpbacked bridges and Euclid's theorems. We laugh, weep, shout and sulk in unison. We like the same food (sausage and steamed puddings) and are on good terms with each other's families. The only problem is that from a certain angle her nose resembles that of an aunt of mine who, when I was very young, used to frighten me with stories about a monster that lived in a haystack. Now every time I see my partner's nose in roughly quarter profile, I am seized with the fear that the haystack monster will catch me. I have not mentioned this to my partner. Should I alter my routines in order to avoid glimpsing her nose at the critical angle? Or should I end the relationship?</p> <p><strong>Mariella</strong> </p> <p>Clearly you can't be expected to compromise on such an elementary issue. What chance does the relationship stand if, caught in profile, your girl frightens the pants off you? It would be an unusual way to approach getting naked and could cost you fortunes on some therapist's sofa in years to come. You're already scarred by your early exposure to an olfactory monster whose mission was to ruin your childhood - to continue such dysfunction into adult life by allowing another nasally challenged terrorist into your life, and your bed, would be absolute foolishness. After all, what is love if not an opportunity to seek out, make a down payment on and then outright own someone else's perfection? You shouldn't be expected to deal with quirks, let alone downright eyesores like the offensive facial feature you describe. What is relationship harmony when compared with a sensitive eye offended? What matter that you'll never find another friend to share your worship of the humpbacked bridge? No, this woman with her copycat moods and wholly compatible nature must go. </p> <p>Ridiculing you apart, I'm intrigued to know on what basis the qualities we find attractive are based. With a number of my men friends, I've come to the conclusion that their starting point is their mother. Is this a gross exaggeration? No doubt my readers will advise, as they always do, but I have noticed a penchant among men to replicate in their wives and lovers the woman who gave birth to them. I'm talking small but all-important details repeated - a guy whose mother had long legs will rarely go for a vertically challenged damsel, and if he does he'll still look longingly at Amazonians. Small, busty mums are often replicated in their daughters-in-law. I've watched three of my closest pals take that route. My favourite source of amusement on this front has to be the guys who say their mothers are a nightmare then marry what seems to be a reincarnation. I've watched so many men fall face first for the woman who most displays similar personality quirks. A pushy mum will rarely be replaced by a docile daughter-in-law, and vice versa, which goes a long way to explaining why there are often complications between those two women in a man's life. </p> <p>Another route available to you aside from ending this idyllic union is trying to separate the haystack monster from your aunt. There's a strong possibility that you confused the storyteller with the story she told. It's a mistake the late Ayatollah made with Salman Rushdie, so it does happen even to grown-ups. You've mixed up a woman decent enough to tell you stories with the terrifying creature she described for your amusement. It hardly seems fair compensation for the hours she lavished on you. Her nose is clearly not the haystack monster's nose, not an appendage to be frightened or put off by, but the olfactory receptacle belonging to the woman who should by rights be your favourite relative. Don't fear the nose - worship it! </p> <p>Now you are lucky enough to have found a carbon copy of this kindly relative and you're making a false connection. If you think about it, your younger self began to see this fictional monster not as created by your aunt but personified by her. It's convoluted, and certainly requires some personal work from your good self, but if you re-examine those childhood encounters you'll see the terrible injustice you've perpetrated in your childish naivet\u00e9. Now you are a man and must do penance for this case of mistaken identity. Your aunt is not a monster and neither is your girlfriend. Instead you now are lucky enough to have two saintly women in your life prepared to waste their valuable time on you. If anyone represents the haystack monster in this trio, it has to be you. Your Cyranella is a gift in adulthood, as was your aunt during your formative days - you're the one with the problem to untangle, and luckily since it's only in your mind, it's close by and easy to address. Go forth and be grateful for the women in your life.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> If you, too, have a dilemma, send a brief email to <a href=\"mailto:mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk\">mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

  "<p><strong>The BBC2 reality series Maestro, which starts on Tuesday, sees eight celebrities learning to become classical conductors and competing for a chance to perform at this year's Proms in the Park. British conductor Ivor Setterfield is mentoring drum'n'bass DJ Goldie on the show. Setterfield has previously wielded the baton for the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, founded the New London Soloists Orchestra and starred in Channel 5's series The Singing Estate</strong></p> <p><strong>Why did you get involved in the show?</strong><br>Recently Goldie came to a concert I was giving where we played a piece by Argentine composer Astor Piazzolla. The next week he mentioned it in his top 10 tracks of all time in a London paper. That was fantastic to me. I think lots of people who come upon this programme accidentally will stay with classical music in the future.</p> <p><strong>How's Goldie getting on?</strong><br>He's doing remarkably well. To some extent, his background in drum'n' bass is a help because he has a good sense of rhythm. Technically, he needs to control his non-conducting hand, which communicates expression, and learn to do less. </p> <p><strong>Who is his stiffest competition? </strong><br>The competition's in flux at the moment because different contestants are evolving at different speeds.

You're in a partnership with your musicians, and it's a combination of many different aspects that make that partnership work.

  "<p>Written and directed by the Hong Kong-based Stephen Chow, who made the immensely successful Kung Fu Hustle and grew up under the spell of Spielberg's ET, CJ7 is about an eight-year-old boy from the slums of a prospering Chinese city whose life is transformed by a cute extraterrestrial his widowed father finds while scavenging on a rubbish tip. The social background is the ever-widening gap between the ruthlessly affluent and the desperately impoverished in the new China, and there are amusing moments.</p>",
  "<p>One match, one win for Iain Dowie; and one week denying he was for the chop. That's the problem with working for billionaires - even if the money has not actually drawn such a conclusion yet there is always someone else who reckons you are not value for it. </p> <p>Lakshmi Mittal and Bernie Ecclestone will, however, demand more from a first full season of Championship football than this scrambled win. Looking little like promotion candidates, QPR fell behind to an early Barnsley goal and came dangerously close to conceding a second, before centre-back Fitz Hall delivered an advantage they barely managed to protect. </p> <p>Midweek news that he had been threatened with the sack was a 'load of tosh,' said Dowie afterwards. Whether the owners had furnished him with a squad capable of winning promotion was more questionable. 'It's very difficult to say that. We've got a lot of good assets that go towards it. We've got some pace in the side, strength, physical stature. I think we can be there or thereabouts, but you've seen what's happened today to some good sides. I'm not pretending we were brilliant, but we got a win.' </p> <p>Favoured by some bookmakers to take this most competitive of divisions, QPR's summer strategy has hardly strained their owners' resources. Instead of a grander name, Dowie was appointed for his experience in elevating Crystal Palace to the Premier League. Player acquisitions, which the 'first team coach' clearly does not control, have been considerably less exuberant than predicted. Tottenham, Newcastle and Fulham reserves in Radek Cerny, Peter Ramage and Lee Cook came for free or on loan; players exchanged for Latvia defender Kaspars Gorkss. For all the fuss Flavio Briatore made over his contacts with storied European clubs, borrowing 19-year-old midfielder Dani Parejo from Real Madrid is one of the less expensive ways of demonstrating it. </p> <p>Commercial activities have been more befitting of QPR's moneyed status. The club claims to have secured record Championship shirt sponsorship and manufacturing deals, while season ticket prices have been ramped up and 100 directors' box seats rebranded the 'C Club' then re-priced at more than \u00a310,000 a season. </p> <p>Welcomed to the field by fireworks, flamethrowers, cheerleaders and their new sponsor's air stewardesses, the players' embarrassment came quickly. In the second minute, Jon Macken was allowed and pick his shot. Too close to Cerny, it remained a warning of things to come. </p> <p>After a couple more chances, Brian Howard directed a pass between centre- and right-back. Iain Hume collected and redirected past the goalkeeper for a first goal since his \u00a31.2m transfer from Leicester. Five minutes had been played and in the next 10 Barnsley could have extended their advantage as Hume and Mounir El Haimour went close and Dexter Blackstock cleared off the line. </p> <p>QPR began to claim some territory, particularly when Emmanuel Ledesma found the ball. Moved to the right wing to accommodate Cook, the Argentine's movement caused consternation in the Barnsley defence. They equalised when Ledesma's free kick flew to Steele's left, was parried out for a Blackstock shot against the bar, then forced in by Hall. </p> <p>If that was the goal you would expect of a defender, his next was not. Cook's corner seemed to be flying out of danger when Hall twisted and volleyed it over his shoulder and far to Steele's right. 'He's got the ability to hit that volley,' said Dowie, who also managed 'One Size' at Oldham and Palace. 'That's not a freak.' </p> <p>Less impressive was Hall's attempt at a hat-trick. When Darren Moore upended Patrick Agyemang in the penalty area, Hall claimed a kick that he struck weakly for Steele to block and gather. </p> <p>QPR remained unconvincing, Cerny fretting as the visitors tested him from set pieces. It was an ill-considered challenge by Marciano van Homoet that eased QPR's passage towards full-time - the full-back lunging at Pajero a few minutes after the Spaniard's arrival from the bench. </p> <p>'We had a two-minute spell with two set plays where the defending wasn't good enough,' said Barnsley boss Simon Davey, 'but in the second half there was only one team in it.'</p>",
  "<p>Manchester City have had 14 managers since Sir Alex Ferguson took up residence at Old Trafford in 1986. The latest of them parks his gleaming black car in the space marked 'Mark Hughes, OBE'. Dressed in faded blue jeans and untucked shirt, Hughes heads for his modest office, ready to discuss with Observer Sport the challenge he took up two months ago following four impressive years in charge at Blackburn.</p> <p>'He doesn't only dominate Manchester, he dominates football in this country and that's because of the longevity and success he's had. It's something that everybody else aspires to,' says the former Manchester United striker of Ferguson, for whom he played for more than a decade in two spells. </p> <p>'No one will ever attain what he's achieved, that's a given. But what we can do is try at some point to knock him off the pedestal.'</p> <p>These are words to rouse City fans everywhere. Ferguson famously said, some years into his reign at Old Trafford, that his greatest challenge at United was 'knocking Liverpool right off their perch'. Hughes was happy to make his comment during a week when there has been speculation that owner Thaksin Shinawatra may have to sell City: it only confirms that he has no doubts over the club's stability. It also emphasises Hughes' confidence that he can oversee long-term growth at City.</p> <p>Of reports that claimed Thaksin, the former Thai Prime Minister, is searching for buyers because his \u00a3800m fortune is frozen pending a court hearing, Hughes says calmly: 'The club is not going to be sold. I have been assured of that. The owner is looking for parties to invest if they are the right people, and for the right areas of the business.' </p> <p>What effect would any potential investment have on his transfer plans? 'None whatsoever.'</p> <p>The club recently had the books audited as a matter of routine and, according to some City insiders, this may have been mistakenly seen as a move towards selling up. The same sources also denied reports that Hughes had only learned through the media of the possible sale of defender Vedran Corluka to Tottenham.</p> <p>Does Hughes have full control of football matters? 'Yeah.' You would not have taken the job otherwise? 'No, no. It's a big operation at Manchester City, that's what struck me. There's a great deal more departments and more personnel than Blackburn. I've been able to bring a good staff with me,' he says of Mark Bowen, Kevin Hitchcock and Eddie Niedzwiecki, who were with him at Ewood Park and during his five years as Wales manager.</p> <p>'They know my needs, understand how I think. They're my voice around the place. We've made big strides in a short space of time - we'll have to see if the changes will impact on the team. We fully expect they will.'</p> <p>What has he done? 'We've changed things around here,' he says of the training complex from which players' agents and friends were recently banned. 'It's a nicer environment - we hope as a consequence our work will improve.'</p> <p>City's new executive chairman, Garry Cook, who was president of the Nike Jordan brand before his arrival a few days before the manager in early June, has no doubts Hughes' approach will work. 'We believe Mark's the brightest young British manager in the game and among his strengths will be bringing the best out of the young talent that exists in abundance at Manchester City.</p> <p>'He commands enormous respect in the dressing room because of his achievements as a player and a manager. That reputation will help us attract some of the best talent.'</p> <p>Cook's assessment matches that of Ryan Giggs, Hughes' team-mate at United when they won two Premier League titles, three FA Cups and the Cup-Winners' Cup. 'He's been at United, Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Barcelona, so he's had different experiences,' says Giggs, who also played under Hughes for Wales. 'He's quiet off the pitch, but on it was a born winner. And I've seen first-hand [with Wales] his organisation, his desire to win. That's why he's been so successful.'</p> <p>Peter Rees was on the Wales FA council that made Hughes, now 44 and then 35, the youngest national manager. 'There isn't much between him and John Toshack. Tosh has done it all at club level,' he says of the current Wales coach. 'And Mark in his first management job with us was very successful. The only disappointment was missing out on qualification for Euro 2004 on away goals in the play-off with Russia.' Hughes was that close to taking Wales to a first major championship since 1958. </p> <p>These views match the Welshman's own quietly spoken self-assessment that he could, in time, dislodge Ferguson. Given his age, his track record and his reputation, was he surprised Chelsea had not contacted him in the summer to talk about replacing Avram Grant? 'Well, possibly. I have no idea what their recruitment strategy is. I don't think Chelsea have had a British manager since Glenn Hoddle 12 years ago. I think they'll always look to foreign fields.'</p> <p>Luiz Felipe Scolari, who did get the job, is a smart operator, just like the other figureheads in the Premier League. What makes an intelligent manager? 'You need an understanding of psychology, physiology - and to be able to mentor players, to be autocratic on occasions. You have to be open to what's out there and understand how it can impact on what you're trying to do. If you're closed off then people at other clubs will get ahead.'</p> <p>Leslie Mark Hughes was born in Ruabon, a small village near Wrexham, in 1963. He was schooled at Ysgol Rhiwabon where 'he was very popular, one of the boys like the rest of them', says Linda Armstrong, who 'used to sit next to him in French' and now works at one of Hughes' favoured watering holes in the village.</p> <p>Hughes, whose father was a goalkeeper who played for Wales schools, joined Manchester United as a schoolboy and his career flourished under Ron Atkinson. 'I first saw Mark in a youth game against Sunderland partnering Norman Whiteside,' says the former United manager. 'Norman was almost a certainty to make it. But Mark had a quiet game and I remember saying, \"I don't know what all the fuss is about.\" But in the last minute he beat five players and laid it across to Norman, who scored. Then I knew.'</p> <p>Hughes' breakthrough came in November 1983 against Oxford United. 'He played on the left wing and scored,' Atkinson recalls. Within two years a Hughes pass had set up Whiteside again - this time the Irishman's extra-time goal against Everton won the 1985 FA Cup. Yet, at 21, Hughes was still a junior member of a side led by Bryan Robson. </p> <p>'I was still in the reserve-team dressing room when I was playing in the Cup final so I never had that relationship with senior players,' he says. 'I played in the team, and went back to the reserves.</p> <p>'It's different now. We've changed it here, but young players are given it very very soon - access to first-team dressing rooms, the advantages of being a first-team player.'</p> <p>Hughes' two years away from Old Trafford at Barcelona and Bayern Munich - he returned in 1988 - offered him valuable lessons for management. 'Barcelona was a fantastic opportunity which I didn't take as a young player,' he says of a season in which he played 28 times before being loaned to Munich. 'My view was that I was going to play for only two or three years, which is clearly at odds with what you should do. You should say, \"I'm staying here for as long as I can and I'll enjoy the experience\".'</p> <p>Bayern was a success. 'It was an experience of understanding a top club - well organised, well prepared, nothing left to chance. I was really impressed with their operation compared to Barcelona, who give you the money and expect you to get on with it.'</p> <p>Hughes returned and was still playing 14 years later before he finally retired at Blackburn. That left him to concentrate on Wales, having taken over as player-manager in 1999. In between he had also played for his boyhood club, Chelsea, Southampton and Everton, having also been a vital member of Ferguson's United team that won a first championship for 26 years in 1993 and the Double the following season. 'He found a way to win and it wasn't always in the rules,' says Tim Sherwood, who captained Blackburn to the Premier League title in 1995. 'If the chips were down and they weren't playing well he'd be a presence - he took that into his management.'</p> <p>'The only thing that used to get me was when centre-halfs clumped me,' says Hughes of the tough-man image that has accompanied him into management. 'Thankfully in daily life that didn't happen very often so I didn't react.'</p> <p>He did, though, famously retaliate when his Blackburn team were labelled dirty. Following Arsenal's 3-0 victory in the 2005 FA Cup semi-final, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and Robin van Persie, who was smashed in the mouth by Andy Todd, complained about Rovers' approach, causing Hughes to criticise reports of the incident. Former Chelsea manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho made similar accusations. </p> <p>'I felt high-profile managers were protecting their position by dumping on me,' Hughes says. 'So I had to protect my players and club. People were a little reluctant to acknowledge we were a very good team, as well as being competitive.'</p> <p>That competitiveness, as a player, helped the modest Hughes - 'I was never the greatest in the world' - to become the first double winner of the PFA Player of the Year award, in 1989 and 1991. 'The only others to have done it are Alan Shearer and Thierry Henry so he's in very good company,' says PFA chairman Gordon Taylor. 'He's very highly regarded by fellow professionals, and certainly now one of the finest young managers.'</p> <p>Sherwood agrees. 'He did a great job as manager at Blackburn,' he says of Hughes' achievement of two top-six finishes, two FA Cup semi-finals and taking Blackburn into the Uefa Cup. 'I think John Williams, the chairman, made a great appointment there. Wherever Mark Hughes goes he will be a winner.'</p> <p>What does Hughes feel is success for City? 'Last year the club had a fantastic start, but unfortunately weren't able to sustain it for whatever reason - things that happened before I was on the radar,' is his assessment of predecessor Sven-Goran Eriksson, who oversaw a team that faded. 'We're trying to make sure we have the range and depth of squad, and levels of physical capacity, to sustain a run at the competitions we're in from start to finish. If we can do that I fully expect us to be in the top 10 again at least.'</p> <p>In time, can City break into the top four? 'Yeah, yeah, that's one of the main reasons I came here. I hope I'll have the resources to really challenge. What they need here is continuity, they've had so many managers in too short a period and my aim is to stick around because by definition that means I'm successful.</p> <p>'The owner's wealth is well documented. Obviously, there are issues at the moment, but we hope to be able to have the means to challenge for the best players. We've shown our intent with our efforts to bring Ronaldinho here.' The interest in the Brazilian forward, who went to Milan, was genuine. 'We came very close by all accounts. We certainly showed intent - in the future that will become more prevalent.'</p> <p>What style of football can City fans look forward to? 'Attacking, hard working, committed and technically excellent.'</p> <p>Since Ferguson's arrival at United only Kevin Keegan has come close to establishing himself at City. He managed nearly four years - an age compared to the 12 others. Hughes' first year at Eastlands should be fascinating.</p>",
  "<p>David Tennant, prince of early evening viewing, destroyer of Daleks, is often described as 'puppyish', and even sometimes as possessing an 'undergraduate' demeanour. In fact, the actor, who was roundly praised last week for his performance as Hamlet at Stratford-upon-Avon, has a manner that's closer to a rakish member of the sixth form, all naughty smirks and school tie askew.</p> <p>And this could well be the thing which suits the 37-year-old for a Shakespearean role in which communicating an adolescent mix of witty arrogance and pained innocence is crucial. Those who have already seen Tennant play the famous young Dane speak of his great skill at humanising the part and making those mad scenes, with their bewildering 'antic disposition', ring touchingly true.</p> <p>Word of this welcome triumph for the Doctor with the Royal Shakespeare Company had reached one London taxi driver this weekend. A big fan of Doctor Who, he said he had first realised just how good a performer Tennant was when he discovered he was really a Scot - and not, that is, a Time Lord from Gallifrey with a cockney accent.</p> <p>This weekend Stratford has been besieged by Tennant enthusiasts of all shapes and sizes. There are those who love his boyish looks, those who love the Doctor, and several who like Shakespeare too. Early on in negotiations over the role, Tennant gave the RSC's Greg Doran a glimpse of what was to come. He told the director they could not go 'anywhere normal' to talk about the project. 'It just turns into a sci-fi convention,' the actor explained. But Doran had faith that RSC audiences would soon forget all about the Tardis.</p> <p>'There are points when he makes you realise that all the wit is a front - an attempt to prevent Hamlet from seeing the abyss into which he's staring. At those moments, I think he has the potential to be truly great,' he said during preview performances earlier this month.</p> <p>Tennant is by now, after three years as Doctor Who, something like a pop star. As a result, he is the subject of endless trivia lists. We know, for instance, that he likes Honey Nut Shredded Wheat. We learn too that his real name is David McDonald, but that he changed it, for Equity reasons, to the surname of the singer in the Pet Shop Boys. We also know he likes the Proclaimers and farting before he goes on stage. That his late mother knitted him a long, multi-coloured Doctor Who scarf when he was a boy, that the first single he bought was Madonna's 'Like a Virgin' and that he used to drive a Skoda.</p> <p>All this personal information is out there now, despite the fact that Tennant only came to wider public attention in 2004 when he appeared in the quirky musical television drama Blackpool, alongside David Morrissey and Sarah Parish.</p> <p>It was in the singing and dancing role of the brooding DI Carlisle that he was spotted by the influential writer Russell T Davies and cast in the leading role of Casanova. Tennant claims he was chosen for this raunchy drama series because he was a 'cheeky chappie', rather than an obvious love god. He was there to show that ladies like entertainment better than good looks, he claims. But he has also admitted he was thrilled at the idea of portraying the young Casanova alongside veteran actor Peter O'Toole's suave interpretation of the same character in old age. Long after filming, he kept a photograph of the two of them together stuck to his fridge door.</p> <p>Tennant, in truth, had been winning plaudits before television made him a household name. Spotted as a stage star in the making, he won the Scottish Critics Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Jimmy Porter in John Osborne's Look Back in Anger and was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Theatre Award for his performance in Lobby Hero at the Donmar.</p> <p>Directors and audiences both respond to his comic charm and mobile features. RSC artistic director Michael Boyd, who directed Tennant as Romeo eight years ago, said: 'He has a tremendous ability to communicate with an audience - he's like an open book. He has such an open face and an open spirit.' While a critic once declared that the young actor 'was blessed with the most eloquent left eyebrow since Roger Moore's'.</p> <p>This sardonic facility appears to have slightly troubled Tennant at times. Discussing his relationship with his then girlfriend, the actress Anne-Marie Duff, he said in 2000: 'She comes to all my first nights, but I do get nervous when she's in, because she has so much integrity and I always feel I don't have as much as she does. That I'm kind of \"whoring it up\" a bit.' If so, it is a kind of vamping that has carried Tennant a long way from his West Lothian home.</p> <p>Born in Bathgate in 1971, he is a 'son of the manse' like another Labour man currently in the public eye. Tennant's father, Sandy, is a former moderator of the Church of Scotland. His mother, Helen, died last summer. Tennant has said the couple were very moral throughout his upbringing, 'but without any of the brimstone and thunder nonsense'.</p> <p>When the actor took part in the BBC's Who Do You Think You Are? family history show he was seen visiting his relatives and learning that his late grandfather, Archie McLeod, is still a footballing legend in Derry, Northern Ireland.</p> <p>After attending Paisley grammar school, Tennant trained at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama and then joined the agitprop theatre company 7:84, a group taking its name from the 7 per cent of the population who controlled 84 per cent of Britain's wealth.</p> <p>Moving down to London in search of work, he lodged with his friend Arabella Weir, the writer and comic actress, who describes him as 'trustworthy' and 'amazingly straightforward and honest'. To prove her conviction, she asked him to be godfather to her youngest child.</p> <p>This summer, in tackling the heaviest role in Shakespeare, Tennant has invited us to hold his visage up next to those of Olivier, Kenneth Branagh, Mark Rylance and Simon Russell Beale, all previously acclaimed Hamlets. But this is perhaps not so daunting for a man who has already set himself up for comparison with a roll call that enjoys an a even more obsessional following. Is he really a better Doctor than, say, Troughton, Baker, Pertwee or Ecclestone? Viewing figures say 'yes', very loudly. Since Tennant took over in 2005 the BBC show has out-performed pretty much everything else going.</p> <p>He has brought what Davies, the former creative genius on the show, describes as 'glitter' to the part. 'You can write anything for him,' Davies has added. 'You're never bored, and you never want him to have bad lines of dialogue. You want to do your best for him.' </p> <p>'David's doctor is a lot more emotional, whereas Chris's was more intense,' notes his former co-star Billie Piper, who played Who sidekick Rose Tyler opposite Ecclestone too.</p> <p>Earlier this summer speculation grew that Tennant would be leaving Doctor Who for good. It reached an unbearable pitch prior to a heavily trailed series finale in which his character almost 'regenerated' - historically the cue for a new actor to appear. But it didn't happen and Tennant has reportedly now been offered \u00a31.3m by the BBC to stick around. 'I've been asked when I'm quitting since the first day I took the part,' Tennant has said. 'I've not quit - I've just not been offered another deal yet.'</p> <p>Speculation about Tennant's love life has also been steaming hot this summer. After a serious relationship with actress Sophia Myles ended, he was spotted on the town with two members of the Doctor Who production team and then with his Christmas special co-star Kylie Minogue.</p> <p>Now, however, he is thought to be seeing Georgia Moffett, the actress who played his daughter in the show, but who is, in actual fact - and stay with the time travel plot here - the daughter of another former Doctor Who, the actor Peter Davison.</p> <p>Harry Potter addicts will have spotted Tennant's evil cameo as Barty Crouch Jnr in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire film, but this autumn he will appear on small screens as the British astrophysicist Arthur Eddington in the play Einstein and Eddington, written by Peter Moffat. It is another serious role which will allow him to reveal the depths that Doran detects behind his fancy showbusiness footwork - to prove again he does have 'that within which passeth show'.</p> <p>Moving away from the gadgetry and camp dialogue of sci-fi is no easy manoeuvre. On the other hand, Star Trek survivor Patrick Stewart, his co-star in Hamlet, is on hand to show Tennant how to effect a deft escape from an inter-planetary vehicle.</p> <p>And, once the excitement about this inter-galactic Hamlet has finally died down, we can prepare ourselves for the judgment on the next. Film star Jude Law is to take up the challenge and pick up poor Yorick's skull in the West End for the Donmar next summer.</p> <h2>The Tennant CV</h2> <p>Born <strong>David John McDonald in Bathgate, West Lothian, 18 April, 1971.

  "<p><strong>On the idea that things must have a beginning being due to the poverty of our thoughts</strong></p> <p>Eleven endings to a piece of writing about the musician, realist and fantasist Damon Albarn and his creative sidekick and fellow conspirator, the graphic artist Jamie Hewlett.</p> <p>1. It's a glorious summer day in late July. Damon and Jamie finish their fags and beers on a roof terrace five floors above street level at the plush, gleaming Royal Opera House in Covent Garden. In 90 minutes or so the curtain will rise for the final performance of a four-day run of their Buddhist acrobatic meta-musical Monkey: Journey to the West. London stretches all around their perch at the heart of the establishment - the London Eye, Nelson's Column, the Houses of Parliament, Battersea Power Station. They are perhaps on top of the world, although the tousled, bleary-eyed, black-clad pair look as though they've just popped to their local for a gossip and a giggle. In one universe we can imagine that, as hot-shot entertainment producers with an uncanny, unlikely understanding of how to give the public what they want, with a daring twist, they are smoking cigars and drinking champagne. On the other hand, here are two close pals with the same contagious sense of humour and furtive relish for rearranging reality, both just turned 40, who can't believe they've just got away with what they've just got away with. They're already planning what, with luck, hard work and a good idea, they might get away with next. What language, century and country this project might be based in, what elusive, even invisible, name it will go by, how specialist and arcane the collaborators will be, is anyone's guess. Jamie takes a puff on his imaginary cigar. 'Anything is possible,' he grins. Damon cackles into his imaginary champagne. An airship gracefully floats past across the sky. For a second it appears that it has Monkey: Journey to the West emblazoned on it.</p> <p>2. Anything is possible.</p> <p>3. 'I kept having to look at the tickets,' says Damon, who's a bit more of a daredevil than his playmate, 'Just to check that we really were at the Royal Opera House. I mean, what an honour.'</p> <p>4. 'When it was first suggested we play the Royal Opera House,' marvels Jamie, the more mischievous of the two, 'I thought, brilliant, let's go for it. I didn't think through what it really meant to the purists, the idea of two scruffy oiks waltzing in through the door.'</p> <p>5. Damon: 'One of my mates turned up on opening night in flip-flops and shorts!'</p> <p>6. Jamie: 'I went to a cocktail party the other day with all the really posh opera types, and I turned up in my baseball hat with a hangover. I was talking to a famous ex-ballerina who is now one of the directors and she said to me, \"I think that people are rather freaked out by your hat.\" I didn't know what she meant, and at that point I made a gesture and knocked a tray of avocado canap\u00e9s all over her dress, thus confirming the general expectation of our loutish behaviour.'</p> <p>7. 'To be honest with you,' admits Damon, who's been working on Monkey for three years, 'when it comes to September, that's it. I'm doing something entirely different.'</p> <p>8. On the roof terrace of their west London headquarters a few months before Monkey plays at the Opera House, Damon waves at a train heading out of London, hoping as always that a driver or passenger might wave back.</p> <p>9. Things are not what they appear nor are they otherwise.</p> <p>10. Damon and Jamie explain what may be happening next to Monkey: Journey To The West, their obliquely enchanting version of the 16th-century Chinese allegorical adventure story based on the obscenely curious, naughty Monkey best known in more recent times as a chaotically dubbed haywire TV series imported from Japan. When it was premiered at the Manchester International Festival in 2007, Monkey seemed a charming, gloriously impractical and surely temporary hybrid of surreal slapstick, mutant pop, Mandarin words, mental grace, flying monks, plate spinning, fractured opera, Hewlett's vivid visuals and Albarn's own particular quest for musical beauty. Later this year they envisage setting up a large matt black tent by the 02 Arena in Greenwich. The Chinese character for Monkey will glow in neon. There will be no ugly sponsorship. </p> <p>'You will be in Monkey world with no distractions,' promises Damon. Chinese masseuses will massage your feet in warm water before you eat Chinese food and then watch the show. 'Beautiful Chinese girls in golden Adidas tracksuits crunching your toes and mending all your stress...' dreams Jamie. 'When you emerge you won't believe where you are. Back to earth with a bump.' Damon: 'We're trying to create a mass-market version of something that started out pretty left-field.' They talk as though this will all really happen - a serious musical alternative to panto that faithfully examines, via clowning, body contortion and somersaulting, spiritual insight and how the greatest medicine is the emptiness of everything. 'It's such a great fucking story,' says Jamie. 'So much better than The Lion King. We've shown when you do this kind of thing it doesn't have to be Chicago with Denise Van Outen.'</p> <p>11. Jamie admits that even after more than 20 performances around the world he still feels moved at the climax of Monkey. 'It's pretty special. It's paradise! Fifteen lotus maidens in pyramid formation, some doing the splits and all spinning plates in front of the all-knowing Buddha... it's bliss.' Damon butts in: 'I just get anxious that the whole thing is going to collapse.' </p> <p><strong>On the fact that we do not normally look at things but overlook them</strong></p> <p>It's an isolated hot day in early spring, the kind of sunny day people describe as a first day of summer, even though it will only lead to monotonous weeks of grey English days. Damon and Jamie have recently moved into a new studio headquarters in west London, where Damon can write and record music that will inspire Jamie to imagine and animate characters that will in turn inspire Damon's music to leap limitations. It's their dream factory, tucked away on a modest street near the BBC, Wormwood Scrubs prison and the concrete Westway of the Clash and JG Ballard. Damon, who can be rangy and compact at the same time, greets me in his studio where he is working on the record version of the Monkey stage show. We move to the terrace at the side of some railway lines where he can light up and happily stare at the deliriously blue sky. A plane soars across on its way to Heathrow. 'This sky is like a pilot's view of the sky... god, being a pilot is such a glamorous job. Here we are just chatting away and above us there are actually people flying planes. Extraordinary.'</p> <p>A train speeds past us. Damon waves and urges me to do the same. We wave at the train, and no one waves back.</p> <p><strong>On being the change you wish to see in the world</strong></p> <p>I make the mistake of opening the interview a little vaguely by asking Damon what the agenda is today. I can immediately sense the often garrulous and gleeful Damon withdrawing at the way I've formally signalled 'an interview'. His self-confidence drains away. Damon will talk about anything, and seems to be theorising about something or other or raising some point whenever he enters or leaves a room or comfortably has your attention - his wife's delicious Victoria sponge; his daughter's reaction to the museums of Florence; the poor state of the nation's bread compared to France; the tendency for the English to make life a bit murky; the allure of travelling; the narcotic nature of X Factor-type shows; the genius of Scott Walker; Jack London's 1905 London underworld book The People of the Abyss; the first barbecue of the year; Gustave Dor\u00e9's engravings of the strange and savage 19th century east London; jazz being of no interest to him after Sun Ra; Chinese politics and the speed at which China is flying into the future; meeting Tony Blair at the Houses of Parliament before he was Prime Minister and realising that it was all wrong and he would never do that again; the outrageous synth-opera of 1970s cabaret surrealist Klaus Nomi; table tennis; his obsession with history as a clue to our future/or the idea that the past is the future; the legal drug industry; the genres of music no one has ever heard held on ageing tape and vinyl in the EMI Hayes vault; the loss of EMI's traditional values; the loss of Ken Livingstone's London dreams; Boris Johnson and London's TV-fuelled desire 'for a new kind of press conference'; the painful decline of the British Empire; the unpredictable emotional consequences of the internet; how we can learn from Africa more than they can learn from us how to deal with the extreme conditions ahead... he craves knowledge, information, speculation.</p> <p>He's not so keen on talking when it comes to a fixed, probing examination of what it is he's up to and why he does it and what it means and why he's so restless. He likes conversation, but not really centred on himself, or at least not his private self. He likes swapping random ideas and miscellaneous thoughts about this, that and the other. He doesn't like the shifting randomness and fizzy miscellany of his mind being spoiled by the dried-up specifics of a magazine interview. Luckily for him, at times when we might be getting bogged down in some area of his biography, or searching a little too doggedly for commercial motive or artistic definition, a train will shoot past and we break from the talk for a wave. Perhaps we are taking a break to consider the idea that life is always moving, flowing and changing, and the less said about that the better.</p> <p>I mention the word 'agenda' because there is so much that Damon has been up to since he left the relatively conventional pop group confines of Blur and transformed into a more flexible musician, thinker and activist that we might today be talking about any number of things. The synergetic Africa Express; his Honest Jon's record label and the Honest Jon's Revue representing his wide-ranging and wonderfully eccentric musical enthusiasms; the ambient dub punk group with no name known by the title of their album, The Good, The Bad and the Queen; the glamorously moody virtual pop group Gorillaz who may or may not have now magically evolved into the virtual group Monkey, who have made an album that may or may not be directly connected to the psychology and sonic flamboyance of the Journey to the West opera; the trailers and title sequence Albarn and Hewlett have produced for the BBC coverage of the Beijing Olympics. The Monkey record which does not feature Damon singing and is a sort of ecstatic, melancholy electro-ghost of the opera.</p> <p>Damon fears it is me that has the agenda, that I am going to nag him about China's human rights record, which has somehow become their responsibility; that I might take the line that he's a slapdash, exploitative musical dabbler skimming surfaces and producing experimental novelties that will not endure; that I am going to drag up the Nineties celebrity nonsense that he has worked hard to bury; that I am going to question when people will be bored with the visibly invisible cerebral sensualist Damon, and wonder when it's all going to go horribly wrong. Or maybe I'm going to love him and the way he dons masks, sheds skins and discreetly reinvents himself, the way he lives for music, crosses and blurs musical borders with considerable respect, designs hybrids with great care, love him far too much. I might add more dubious sparkle to the rampaging Monkey hype, where in a way Albarn is the provocative, impertinent Monkey who has learnt to find his faults, feel deep regret, and correct his mistakes, to reform sincerely, practise kindness, concentrate the mind, sever selfishness, and awaken. (There are in fact three Monkeys in all this - the cuddlier cartoon BBC Monkey, the slightly more sinister rascally Monkey in the opera and the much more menacing Monkey of the record. Damon too can be sweet, brazen and wrathful.)</p> <p>Adulation ultimately worries Albarn more than the suspicion he feels has followed him all through his music career. Those that adore you can quickly be disappointed. Those that adore you expect more than you might want to give.</p> <p><strong>On making yourself into zero that you might become invincible</strong></p> <p>Albarn reluctantly toys with the word agenda, and finds his way to answer. He talks in a cultivated drawl that's casual and intense and sometimes verges on seeing the irony in everything and/or sounding wounded by the appalling injustices of life. 'Well, it's been a different way of making a record, and after spending over three years on Monkey I didn't want it to be just a straight theatrical recording of the stage performance. I now know a lot about the musical ideas I want to explore but not necessarily what form they should be in. It's with the form of a record where you set an agenda. I've been lucky so far that the form I've found for the records I've put out since Blur has worked. It remains to be seen whether an electro record in Mandarin is going too far, but I don't regret it because I've enjoyed the process. And if you worry about what people want, you start to give them what you think that is, and that's a tendency I've tried to resist. Not because I don't love people liking what I do - I need that as much as anyone - it's just... it has to be an adventure. When you make a new piece of music you want to go on an adventure.'</p> <p>A goods train thunders by. We wave. The driver looks at us. He does not wave. Damon shakes his head. 'I think if you wave long enough eventually someone will wave back and that will be... very nice.'</p> <p><strong>On understanding both sides</strong></p> <p>Jamie arrives at the operation HQ. He's in pain. Proving when drunk to some friends that he could still do high kicks even though he was approaching 40, he did one too many and slipped a disc. He's been lying on his side for three weeks listening to Radio 4 with a small easel next to him. He's come to listen to some music so that he can continue drawing characters and scenes for the Monkey record artwork.</p> <p>Damon and Jamie are extremely at ease in one other's company and have started to resemble each other even though they don't actually look alike. They bicker and banter like a comedy double act that's been together for years. 'He takes care of his side and I take care of my side,' says Jamie simply, with a shrug. 'We never tread on what the other does,' says Damon, as if all is revealed about their collaborations. Back in the Blur days Hewlett was more the friend of guitarist Graham Coxon, and Damon says at the time he felt excluded from some private joke they were both in on. Now Albarn and Hewlett are the jokers. They decide together on various far-fetched schemes and themes, and marvel as one or two of them actually come to life. Damon veers off into other projects, so does Jamie, but they never seem to feel insecure about their partner mixing with other schemers and dreamers.</p> <p>They followed up a debut Gorillaz album that seemed to have completed that particular mission with the deeper, darker time bomb pop of Demon Daze, where the challenge they set themselves was not to do something completely different but something the same but better. Monkey is Gorillaz in disguise, or Gorillaz without the disguise, or something completely different but the same, or more theories about life and death, joy and sadness, with an inventive, evocative, often deliciously apprehensive and edgily elegant Albarn soundtrack. It is written and produced by Albarn, although it is not as such an Albarn solo album, which would seem horribly prosaic. It's by Monkey, not as such the character in the opera, but a convenient name for this particular release, another of Damon's make-believe groups that both do and do not exist. For Damon, the name of a pop group is merely the foam on a wave, the shadow of a shadow.</p> <p><strong>On how when you realise how perfect everything is you will tilt your head back and laugh at the sky</strong></p> <p>Albarn: 'We had all the Malians come over to rehearse for the Honest Jon's Revue and we had them at the studio. It was a lovely day so we rehearsed on the roof by the railway lines. There were 30 Mali musicians playing very loud music and whenever a train came past we all waved! People must have thought, did I actually see that, or have I had a very long and tiring day. No one waved back, though.'</p> <p><strong>On how since everything is a reflection of our minds everything can be changed with our minds</strong></p> <p>Monkey began as an exploration of traditional Chinese culture in a dreamily symbolic setting and it has now gained a pressing contemporary edge with their official BBC collaboration and the risk to the safe commercial delivery of an Olympic tournament due to the Chinese persecution of Tibetan monks.</p> <p>Albarn: 'We didn't go into it without our eyes shut, not thinking that at some point there was going to be a lot of scrutiny of China and their human rights. The Chinese are totalitarian in the sense that they do not as a society tolerate deviation from what they think should be done. Within that they are a very liberal-minded society, and that dichotomy is very difficult to understand. Who knows what will happen in Beijing. It's a very volatile situation. But I do know that we have to understand and engage with China.'</p> <p>Hewlett: 'And do not take it for granted that the Chinese people agree with the actions of the Chinese government. If it does all blow up in our faces, I would still stand up for the fact that we did this. The level of understanding in the West of this vast country and its people is very low and if you get a chance why not do what you can to shine a light on its ways.'</p> <p><strong>On the fact that where there is light there is shadow</strong></p> <p>Albarn: 'Our experience while doing this project had made us appreciate that Chinese culture is brighter and stronger than American culture. They've a lot to answer to when it comes to human rights and they can be very belligerent but that's because there's one-and-a-half billion of them. Look, when we started Monkey we had something very strong that we wanted to say about China. It now has a political context. There's nothing we can do about that and usually when it comes to something like Tibet I would be in the camp of those who complain and protest. I now find myself in the strange position that while I agree with the stone-throwers I understand the other position. I understand the glass that is having the stones thrown at it even as I could be throwing the stones. I'm not agreeing at all with what China is doing but I think it is important that a dialogue with China keeps going or they'll disappear behind a wall for ever.'</p> <p>Hewlett: 'And then you'll never know what's going on there.'</p> <p>Will this be the Chinese century in the way that the 20th century was the American century ?</p> <p>Albarn: 'There are certain elements of Chinese culture that could be considered Utopian if it did happen. At the same time there is this dark shadow across all the positivity. It's a society that is mutating all the time and they could yet absorb the worst part of our culture and it will all be a complete mess. Yes, it is the Chinese century but what sort of China it will be I can't imagine.'</p> <p><strong>On all philosophies being mental fabrications</strong></p> <p>Albarn's writing studio is three floors up and is filled with musical scores that he likes to read for inspiration, old folk songs, hymns and choral pieces. There's an old solid metal typewriter he bought in Florence that he uses to write out his lyrics. It was made in Germany. He wonders if perhaps it's from the 1940s, and is therefore a Nazi typewriter. The thought perversely pleases him. There are some windows that give him views of the sky and some trees on the opposite side of the street. 'I'm writing my music looking out of a little window while planes go by.' He plays me some of the Monkey music, which blends the idealised sound of peaceful, ancient, remote China with the deafening honks, babble and urgency of modern China, and the trees opposite sway and rustle in time with the music. Damon dances to his music, unashamedly lost in the thoughts he's having about how three years of thoughts - about the history and future of China, about how to follow up Blur, Gorillaz, his Mali music, his film soundtracks, the decaying London of The Good, the Bad and the Queen, his own perfectionist craving for newness that honours oldness, for strangeness that emphasises romance - have turned into an electric music that is clearly by the musician responsible for the above, and yet by a new kind of musician. Listening to Monkey you can tell it's made by a musician who can cry when he hears a piece of music that moves him. </p> <p><strong>On how once all struggle is grasped, miracles are possible</strong></p> <p>Just before the final Monkey show at the Royal Opera House, Opera magazine host an informal discussion, exploring for a classical readership unfamiliar with Albarn's pop music the possibility that Journey to the West might actually not just be hyperbolically called an opera but might actually be an opera. (Albarn has never suggested one way or another that it is or isn't, knowing only perhaps that it is a melodramatic performance of an often baffling story without much speaking and a fair amount of passion, best seen in a theatre. For him, it is nothing but Monkey. He let's others - management, theatres, publicists, writers, critics - battle it out for the most helpful commercial, creative and/or critical definition, amused by the struggle.)</p> <p>A young classical music critic, Erica Jeal, sits with Damon and the production's musical director David Coulter, the adventurous Berlin-born conductor Andr\u00e9 de Ridder and the theatre and film director Chen Shi-Zheng, who directed the performances and trawled Chinese theatre schools for the large mobile cast. Hewlett cheerfully excuses himself from this duty. The proudly eclectic Albarn is in his element, a leader, but part of a team, the centre of attention, but just part of a group of articulate talkers and thinkers who are all experts in their world.</p> <p>The conversations chart the growth of Monkey from the early field recordings in old and new, peasant and city China to the orchestral production, and how Albarn resisted creating a dreaded fusion of rock and Chinese music by filtering his response to Chinese sounds and systems through his own rigorous compositional technique. For Shi-Zheng, Albarn has crafted an authentic, personal symbiosis of East and West and he admires how Albarn can express an idea musically in the most concise form, with the greatest simplicity of means, with freshness and life.</p> <p>Albarn didn't want to try to please both the pop audience and a classical audience and miss both targets. He talks about hearing noises wherever he is, the street, an airport, a farm, and how that can then become a piece of music. 'I sit in the studio and find some noises and then get stoned and see what happens,' he confesses. Erica worries whether Damon's publicist will be alarmed to hear him say that. Albarn snorts at the thought. His colleagues describe how Albarn's logical but instinctive approach to new music is so refreshing compared to the rigid and institutionalised classical music standard. Shi-Zheng explains how he wanted to do Monkey in English. It was Damon who insisted it should be in Mandarin.</p> <p>Composers are mentioned such as Bartok, for the field recordings and folksong appropriation, Monteverdi, 'because seeing L'Orfeo was a pivotal moment', the 12th century Perotin, for the power of voices, Satie, for the elysian simplicity, Michael Tippett for the harrowing emotion. 'In a way I am quite old fashioned, and love the romantic bigness, the stirring, quite nationalistic sound of Elgar and Vaughan Williams and those big emotional melodies always creep into what I do. But I also love Stockhausen.'</p> <p>At the end of the conversation, Erica asks Damon to sign the cover of Blur's Think Tank.</p> <p><strong>On people being like monkeys frantically grasping for the moon in the water</strong></p> <p>As we talk by the railway lines, Blur crops up, and I make a reference to 'the glory days'. 'These days if I'm on stage I like to be at the back playing the piano. It's strange because in the glory days, you couldn't stop me from being at the front. Now I'm the complete opposite. I suppose I now want to let the music do all the work. I love singing, and I will do more, but I feel it's difficult being a front man.'</p> <p>Was he any good at it ?</p> <p>'I suppose I must have been good at it and I definitely put my heart and soul into it. I did find it difficult and I did envy everyone else having an instrument. I suppose I overcompensated. It's just that now I really enjoy being in the background. I just didn't want to be confined to the cool rock image thing. I was always kind of belligerent with that and it perhaps came across as arrogant and cocksure. I'm not like that now. It's got something to do with growing up. '</p> <p>Since Blur, he has been negotiating different ways of being in the background without completely sacrificing star presence.</p> <p>'It's the key to maintaining a career as you get older. I do love performing, but if I had been at the centre of the Monkey performance on stage it would have done my head in. I mean, I've been successful being in the background because of the music. The music was good enough to allow me to be in the background without anyone missing me. It was such a nice sound, Gorillaz, and I've come back to it a lot on this Monkey record. There is some concern from various formal places about whether that makes it a Gorillaz record... or not... and I suppose knowing one way or another might help it in the marketplace. On the other hand, it's the same music whatever you call it, by the same people.'</p> <p>Does he play games with his persona as famous pop star ?</p> <p>'Not really. You cannot be unaware that an awful lot of people recognise you. I was looking at MTV's Cribs because I saw that Alex James was going to be on and as I hadn't been to his house I thought it would be a nice way to see the place. Not that he hasn't invited me, I hasten to say. But it was the 10 most richest Cribs that was on and it made me feel... better in a sense about myself, that this was how far out of control the conceits of pop stardom can take you. I was watching it as punter, in every sense of the word, and it was alarming to me. I don't think it's healthy to be famous unless you are very down to earth and even though I am moderately down to earth I have no desire to be famous. It did nearly get out of control for me in the Nineties obviously. Blur and Oasis connected the tabloids with pop music in a way that hadn't really happened before. It's not something to be necessarily proud of. I was greatly disorientated. I can draw a line from then to how they've gone after Amy Winehouse and Pete Doherty. It's absolutely not a world that musicians should be anywhere near. In the end, I hung on by a thread.'</p> <p>A passenger train races by and our yearning waves rescue him from dwelling too much on his gaudy, soapy Britpast, before he found Jamie, and musical groups that lacked conventional shape and fixed personnel, and China, and saw how the greatest wisdom comes from seeing through appearances.</p> <p><strong>On how your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own unguarded thoughts</strong></p> <p>Because of their Chinese experience, Albarn and Hewlett were asked by the BBC if they would talk about writing the music and creating the images for their Olympic coverage. Jamie recalls how when Damon heard of the BBC's interest he said, well, if they want to make music of a Chinese nature, they should be talking to us. 'We both agreed that we should have that job and not let any other idiot have it.'</p> <p>Damon rolls his eyes, fearing private enthusiasm has slipped out and might remind people of previous pomposity.</p> <p>Hewlett:: 'It's true! That's what you said.'</p> <p>Albarn : 'Yeah, right, if you say so.'</p> <p>Hewlett : 'If anyone is going to do Chinese music for the BBC, it's you.'</p> <p>Albarn : 'Well, that's not strictly true...'</p> <p>'Hewlett: 'OK then, how are you going to spin it ?'</p> <p>A train shoots by. Damon waves. Jamie and I join in.</p> <p>On how the rule of friendship means there should be mutual sympathy between friends, each supplying what the other lacks and trying to benefit the other, always using friendly and sincere words</p> <p>Damon runs off to fetch coffee and bread-and-butter pudding at a deli. Jamie and I are alone by the railway lines, waving at the trains with a little less commitment than when we're with Damon. 'What I was trying to say before, when Damon pulled a funny face, the BBC were no doubt talking to other people and we just felt we were qualified to do this, because we've spent the last few years immersing ourselves in Chinese culture. And we'd want to do it really well in a way that not only suits the BBC and all the demographic boxes they must tick but which retains our sensibility. Who else were they going to get to do it?'</p> <p>Mike Batt?</p> <p>'Those are the kind of people they usually go to. Phil Collins. Elton John. Never in our wildest dreams did we think they would ask us, that we'd be in with the BBC. I wonder what kind of doors that might open? Then again, everyone will be sick of it by the end of the summer. That bloody song again and that bloody monkey.'</p> <p>Damon arrives carrying coffee and cake for three. 'That's not easy on a bicycle,' he boasts. A train hurtles past. We wave. Nothing in return. 'Damon's hoping that one day a ghostly face might wave back. He looks a bit like the boy from \"Duelling Banjos\" when he does it. No wonder no one waves back.'</p> <p>Albarn: 'It is a bit Forrest Gump, I suppose.'</p> <p>What if someone did wave back?</p> <p>'I'd get very self-conscious and never do it again, probably.'</p> <p><strong>On how your work is to discover your work and then with all your heart give yourself to it</strong></p> <p>Eleven beginnings to a piece of writing about the one or the two known as Monkey.</p> <p>1. It's a glorious summer day in late July. On a roof terrace of the Royal Opera House, Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett, who on this occasion are representing themselves singly as man who writes music and man who draws pictures and together as Monkey formerly known, possibly, as Gorillaz, who were flesh and blood cartoon characters. Damon Albarn has checked in on some rehearsals for the final Opera House performance of the Journey to the West opera, and he is not happy. The soundman has been sneaking reverb in - an unforgivable sin - and one or two of the musicians and singers are not concentrating enough. He's had to let his feelings be known about their slackness in front of his daughter, and it's made him uncomfortable.</p> <p>'You can have bad gigs and good gigs and just because this is a massive theatrical performance doesn't make it any different, but I got the feeling today that people were resting on their laurels just because there has been a brilliant commercial and critical reaction, and I do not like that. This is a very proud moment for us and no one should take it for granted. We may never get a chance like this again.</p> <p>'I have seen this kind of hype so many times before, and it's the worst thing that can happen in a way. Of course you want everyone to go nuts and go wild, but you have got to be really, really smart when that happens and be aware that it can turn your head and lead to self-destruction.'</p> <p>Is he watching himself by making sure things are in order?</p> <p>'I am checking myself, because none of them are going to get in the shit if it goes wrong, even if it is their fault. The reviews are great, therefore at every performance we have to make sure we are excellent and that we deserve those reviews.'</p> <p>2. 'Chen Shi-Zheng has taught us about the Buddhist principle that you must not mourn for the past, or worry about the future, or anticipate troubles, but live in the present moment wisely and earnestly. That's why we call him Chairman Now.'</p> <p>3. As the current Albarn-Hewlett group project is called Monkey, it appears that their next abstract venture will be called something in Spanish (Carosella, maybe) and it will be something to do with a war machine, or a cavalry training mechanism - the source of modern merry-go-rounds - and it might be on ice, or refer to the carnival carousel in Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes where you grow older or younger depending on which way you ride. Musically, there will possibly be a reference to Albarn's passion for the kinetic tunes Bertolt Brecht lyrics would be fastened to. And some Human League. 'There's always some Human League. I remember the moment I became a little bit more political when I spliced on tape some of my Dad's Arabic recordings over the Human League's 'The Lebanon'. Heaven 17's Penthouse and Pavement was a favourite. And there's the Specials and the Combat Rock Clash and Big Audio Dynamite. But when I was a kid I had all this access to African and Asian and Indian music and spirituals, Paul Robeson. That was what I listened to growing up. That was what was played at home. Sufi music. I absorbed it all. I didn't arrive at this non-pop music in a Beatles-like revelation. It was always there. In a way, pop took me away from it for a while.'</p> <p>4. Anything is possible. You should hear their idea about what they want to do for the live broadcast when the Beijing Olympics hands over to the London Games. I don't want to give away the surprise, but it involves Buckingham Palace, Phil Daniels and a Chinese choir.</p> <p>5. Albarn: 'I do not understand bands that just go on and on and on and on and when they make a record they always end up in the same place. Pop groups can be very militant about their sound and retain it for ever. I suppose it's because they do not want to lose touch with their audience. They really love their audience. It's a friendship they don't want to threaten by changing.'</p> <p>6. Hewlett: 'We had fantastic lunches with Terry Gilliam about turning Journey to the West into a film. That's the closest we ever got to a Monkey film.' Albarn: 'We spend a lot of our life talking about a film.'</p> <p>7. 'Hewlett: 'Maybe China will be the first Empire to really conquer space.'</p> <p>And unlike America they won't take God with them.</p> <p>Albarn: 'That's the great thing about China. They don't have this insane idea that there's a man in a white beard sitting in the sky. They think about life more cosmically.'</p> <p>8. Albarn: 'I don't think Blur ever fulfilled their full potential. But it doesn't matter if they never do. Graham Coxon is happy doing what he's doing and I'm happy doing what I'm doing. So that's all right then.'</p> <p>9. Has Damon Albarn become a kind of David Bowie, shifting from musical space to musical space, pulling off conjuring trick after conjuring trick, like a shifty postmodern musical wizard? Or, after his flirtation with pop stardom, is he releasing increasingly obscure projects with increasingly confusing promotional attachments hoping that he can shake off the burden of an audience and live happily ever after left alone in his own splendid, peaceful musical universe?</p> <p>10. At the end of the Opera magazine discussion, Damon suddenly exclaims: 'This experience has changed my life! I will never be the same again!' Everyone looks at him. Is this a cue for everyone to burst into song and dance around the room? Damon is a bit shamefaced at this emotional outburst, worried that it's a sign he's believing his own publicity. He quickly reverts to slightly gloomier type and mooches off to scold some musicians.</p> <p>11. A packed passenger train roars past their west London headquarters. Under a hot afternoon sun, Jamie and Damon vigorously wave at everyone. Travellers stare at this grinning gesticulating pair on a West London roof terrace and have absolutely no idea who they are.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Journey to the West, by Monkey, is released on CD/download by XL Recordings on 18 August.</p> <h2>The essential Monkey 500 years of magic</h2> <p><strong>1590 </strong>Journey To The West is published anonymously during the Ming Dynasty.

  "<p>'Let's be frank about it - most of our people have never had it so good,' declared Britain's new Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in 1957. With the Suez Crisis still fresh in people's minds, a potentially cataclysmic outbreak of fire at the Windscale atomic plant in Cumberland and Cold War tensions mounting, plenty disagreed with him. Then, in 1958, Elvis joined the army, Manchester United's all-conquering Busby Babes were decimated in the Munich air disaster. At this time, on the coat tails of Chris Barber Band guitarist and banjo player Lonnie Donegan, the nation's youth suddenly empowered themselves with music, grabbing cheap guitars and household accoutrements to ape the makeshift skiffle bands of the American underclasses who played raw blues and jazz in the 1920s.</p> <p>The great unwashed had at last found a voice and, terrified by the escalating threat of nuclear war, they had something passionate to say with it. Haunted by images of the human devastation caused by the two atomic bombs - disconcertingly dubbed 'Little Boy' and 'Fat Man' - dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to end the Second World War, a generation started marching. </p> <p>The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament held its first meeting in February 1958 and less than two months later several hundred people - estimates vary erratically between 600 and 6,000 depending on who you ask - gathered in Trafalgar Square for its first major operation, a 53-mile protest march to Aldermaston, the Berkshire town designated by former Prime Minister Clement Attlee as the centre of Britain's nuclear weapons industry. 'This,' roared Labour's left-wing firebrand Michael Foot before they set off, 'can be the greatest march in English history.' </p> <p>What he couldn't have imagined was that it would also have such a profound impact on British music. </p> <p>Marching behind their emotive banners proudly sporting Gerald Holtom's freshly designed iconic CND badge, they headed off on the coldest Good Friday for 41 years in duffle coats and hobnail boots and with knapsacks on their backs. One of the prime movers in the march, Canon Collins of St Paul's Cathedral, had asked for silence during the walk in deference to Easter, but when they reached their first overnight stop - at Hounslow - they were led into the town by Ken Colyer's band playing 'When the Saints Go Marching In', 'High Society' and 'Lady Be Good', while those at the back contented themselves with chanting '1-2-3-4-5 keep the human race alive...' </p> <p>After a night on the floor in church halls around Hounslow, Twickenham and Isleworth and a 3/6d breakfast, they marched on to Slough and then Reading through snow and slush in what became the worst Easter weather for more than a century. They looked a sorry bunch - the Daily Mail likened them to 'columns of displaced persons who struggled across Europe in 1945 or perhaps the enchanted followers of some Orwellian pied piper' - and some dropped out. But mostly they soldiered on, rallied by the sound of the jazz bands, church choirs and skiffle groups scattered through the miles and, almost imperceptibly along the route, the tradition of song as a soundtrack to political protest, lifting spirits and symbolising unity, was firmly established.</p> <p><strong>That 1958 march marked Britain's first postwar</strong> expression of mass protest, triggering a major national Easter event over the next few years. More significantly for the music scene, it fired up young musicians to write campaigning new songs to argue the case against the bomb and whip up support along the way. Suddenly many of those in skiffle groups playing American songs were changing course and writing fierce topical songs to back direct action. </p> <p>The hydrogen bomb - said to be 1,000 times more powerful than the atom bomb that destroyed Hiroshima - was first tested by the Americans on Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands in the west Pacific in 1954. Eric Winter, a left-wing journalist from Manchester and a member of the London Youth Choir, founded Britain's first folk music magazine Sing in the image of the American Sing Out. 'As this copy of Sing goes to press the world is under the shadow of the hydrogen bomb tests carried out this summer by the US Navy,' wrote Winter in an early editorial as the mag published its first wave of topical songs. 'The hydrogen bomb may be able to destroy singers but cannot destroy songs - songs are stronger than the hydrogen bomb... we believe that song has a powerful role to play in the struggle of the British people for peace and socialism.' </p> <p>The London Youth Choir sang 'Put My Name Down' as it launched a petition to ban the bomb, Leon Fung wrote the calypso 'The Atom Bomb &amp; The Hydrogen' and John Hasted, a communist from Suffolk who went to Oxford and later became head of physics at Birkbeck College, contributed 'Talking Rearmament'. Other early campaigning songwriters included Alex Comfort, who went on to greater fame as the author of The Joy of Sex and Liverpool's Stan Kelly, who had recently graduated from Cambridge and achieved the country's first postgraduate diploma in computer science and wrote 'Liverpool Lullaby' (later recorded by Cilla Black).</p> <p>The most forceful voice, however, belonged to Ewan MacColl, who had written his first durable song 'The Manchester Rambler' at the age of 17 in celebration of the mass trespass challenging right of way laws on Kinder Scout in the Peak District in 1932. By the 1950s, he was writing numbers such as 'The Ballad of Ho Chi Minh' and 'The Ballad of Stalin' ('Joe Stalin was a mighty man and a mighty man was he/ He led the Soviet people on the road to victory'). Already the key figure in the burgeoning folk movement with his Ballad &amp; Blues club at the Princess Louise in London's Holborn district, MacColl wrote characteristically volatile songs about the threat to peace, notably 'Against the Atom Bomb'. </p> <p>'There are now more new songs being written than at any other time in the past 80 years - young people are finding out for themselves that folk songs are tailor-made for expressing their thoughts and comments on contemporary topics, dreams and worries,' MacColl told the Daily Worker in 1958. Three days after the Munich crash three songwriters, including Brendan Behan's brother, Dominic, turned up at the Ballad &amp; Blues with tribute songs about the Busby Babes. Another visitor was Californian Guy Carawan, partly responsible with Pete Seeger for updating and popularising 'We Shall Overcome', who performed his own pungent commentary on the nuclear threat, 'Talking Atomic Blues' ('Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Alamogordo, Bikini/Peace in our world ... or the world in pieces.')</p> <p>So when the first march to Aldermaston was mooted, Eric Winter and his friends decided it urgently needed a theme song. A week before the march a small group of enthusiasts met up and John Brunner, who went on to become a prolific science fiction novelist, produced a poem he had written for the occasion, 'The H-Bomb's Thunder' ('Men and women, stand together/Do not heed the men of war/Make your minds now or never/Ban the bomb for evermore'). With some tinkering, it was fitted to the rousing tune of 'The Miner's Lifeguard', a song from mining disputes in the early 1900s popular with American trade unionists. Aldermaston had its anthem.</p> <p>Initially the organisers were unimpressed. 'We were told, thanks, our help wouldn't be needed because it was going to be a silent march all the way,' said Karl Dallas (or 'Fred' as he was known then). 'We said that was stupid and they agreed to let us help on condition we stuck to an officially approved list of songs, which included some real stinkers written by an anonymous CND leader. Certain songs were banned, not necessarily because of their content, but because they were sung by communist sympathisers like Pete Seeger. Among those subject to embargo, I recall, were 'Down By the Riverside' and 'If I Had a Hammer.'</p> <p>Dallas, whose day job was publicising Billy Smart's Circus, led the advance guard, arriving in towns ahead of the official march to play with his skiffle group, belting out 'The H-Bomb's Thunder', his own 'hit' song 'The Family of Man' and others not necessarily on the CND-approved list, singing in the marchers as they triumphantly arrived in each town. 'It was celebratory,' he says. 'We were pilloried by some of the media because we were having such a great time. I don't know how many pregnancies there were after that march but I bet there were plenty.'</p> <p>The following year, when a much bigger march went in the opposite direction from Aldermaston to London, Dallas led much of the singing. 'I worked the march ... I'd go to the front and say \"Right, we're all gonna sing\" and we'd launch into something like \"Oh no no, not in my name, not in my name\" over and over again. Then we'd move back and start them singing somewhere else. And afterwards all these people went home and started folk clubs...'</p> <p>Dallas's subsequent role in the folk revival was primarily as a journalist, notably writing for Melody Maker, but like other survivors of his generation, he continues to fight the good fight. Now 77 and living in Bradford, he sits in one of the city's many convivial curry emporiums, long grey hair cascading over his shoulders from beneath a jaunty hat, talking about his latest venture, travelling the country on his free bus pass to sing on the streets, in bus shelters and folk clubs in what he describes as a 'Freedom to Ride' tour. He talks about singing in Palestine and in Baghdad, where he was one of the 'human shields' trying to deter Bush and Blair from bombing essential Iraqi services in 2003. Dallas planned a rock concert in Baghdad to drum up more support and was in Oman en route to trying to persuade the likes of the Rolling Stones, Joan Baez and Country Joe McDonald to participate when the bombing started and he was refused permission to return to Iraq. 'It's still a bit of a sore point,' he says.</p> <p>Dallas - a born-again Christian after 50 years of atheism - still refers to himself as a Stalinist and one of his proudest claims is that the UK Special Branch, the American FBI, the Soviet KGB, the Israeli Mossad and the East German Stasi all had secret files on him. After an eventful life that has also seen him survive alcoholism, he writes a poem every day and is as passionate as ever about the vital power of music and poetry.</p> <p>'I'm a demo singer,' he says, 'that's what I do. See, I was fascinated by the idea of the broadsides, which were in a sense the origins of newspapers. If someone was going to be hung they'd write a broadside supposedly telling this man's confession and they'd sell it around the gallows and sing it. And I wrote a song about Derek Bentley' (the 19-year-old hanged for murder in 1953 but eventually cleared by a Court of Appeal 45 years later). 'Ewan MacColl recorded it and for a short while I became his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. But I was too bigheaded and he was too intolerant of bigheads.'</p> <p>MacColl wrote his own song 'That Bomb Has Got to Go' ('Ashes to ashes and dust to dust/ If the bomb doesn't get you then the fallout must...'), handing out lyric sheets on the road to Aldermaston. Among those who sang it was his future wife, the American singer, banjo player and singer Peggy Seeger, who went on to fight many campaigns with him, writing numerous strident, crusading songs of her own. She is now back living in the US but was in the UK recently, proving she had lost none of her fire, producing a clock specifically timed to show the hours and minutes George Bush has left in office and bringing the house down on stage with a deeply emotive song based on conversations with Iraq war veteran Jimmy Massey.</p> <p>'Ewan used to talk a lot about demonstrations and marches in the 1930s and he'd talk of them as battles,' she says. 'But there were no battles with Aldermaston. In later marches against the Vietnam War some of those got turned into pitch battles but Aldermaston was very special. I was new to the country and I'd never demonstrated against anything before. It was an adventure. Every 100 yards or so you had a different kind of band - jazz, blues, skiffle, West Indian. And of course people made up their own songs. You didn't just shuffle along in misery. They were hopeful days and Aldermaston marches had a sense of optimism later marches didn't have. We were fighting for something - peace - rather than fighting against something. Peace was like a big red balloon and we were heading towards it. We really felt that if we marched we could shut this bloody place down.'</p> <p>Perceived wisdom is that the explosion of British singer-songwriters in the 1960s was ignited by their iconic American counterparts but another veteran of the 1958 march, Leon Rosselson - a young satirist who was to contribute material to cult TV show That Was the Week That Was - insists it was the other way round.</p> <p>'Americans came over and were very impressed to find people writing songs. That wasn't happening at the time in America so they went back and founded Broadside, which was the mag set up specifically to publish new American songs. That was the first one to publish Dylan, Phil Ochs and all those. Rather than American protest singers inspiring British songwriters, it was the other way round.</p> <p>'As brief as it was, skiffle was important in making people feel they could do it for themselves rather than just listen to the radio. Lots of songs were about the fear of nuclear war but without the folk revival they wouldn't have had a platform. People were angry but they were also optimistic that something was finally happening. It felt like the birth of something. Which, I suppose, it was.'</p> <p>Film-maker Lindsay Anderson, who later directed This Sporting Life and If... made a documentary film of the 1958 march and the Aldermaston campaign escalated in the ensuing years. 'It was tremendously exciting,' says Martin Carthy, folk music pioneer and another early march survivor. 'We didn't actually talk about ban the bomb all that much because everyone agreed about that, but it was a great chance to meet people and hear songs.'</p> <p>The 1959 march attracted 15,000 people and stretched for seven miles, headed by writer Jacquetta Hawkes - JB Priestley's wife - who presented a Ban the Bomb charter at 10 Downing Street wearing a crimson stetson and yellow ankle socks as protesters filed silently through Whitehall accompanied only by the beat of a single drum, spelling in Morse code the letters N and D - nuclear disarmament. In 1960, 100,000 were estimated to have gathered at the climax in Trafalgar Square; the following year they linked up with a new march from the US Air Force base at Wethersfield in Essex. </p> <p>In songwriting terms Aberdonian Ian Campbell raised the bar with his shockingly vivid 'The Sun is Burning in the Sky', which became a new Aldermaston anthem ('Now the sun has come to earth/ Shrouded in a mushroom cloud of death/ Death comes in a blinding flash of hellish heat and leaves a smear of ash/And the sun has come to earth...') and was later recorded by Simon &amp; Garfunkel. Actress Sheila Hancock, already a big TV star in her role of daffy Carol in the BBC's The Rag Trade, tapped into the mood of the day, duetting with Sydney 'Lord of the Dance' Carter on his satirical song 'Coming Down From Aldermaston' as the hunger for topical songs grew.</p> <p>In 1964, Stephen Sedley - now the Rt Hon Lord Justice Sedley, a Court of Appeal judge - wrote a perceptive assessment in The Observer of the new cultural phenomenon. 'The folk song clubs that now cover Britain like a rash - there are up to 300 of them with thousands of members - have been hotbeds of new songs. In terms of the old assumptions about anonymity and oral transmissions, these songs may not be classified as folk, but in style, structure and function they are in the main a living extension of the body of genuinely popular British song with which the folk revival has been familiarising folk club audiences ... death looms large as it always did, but in contrast to the bestselling murder broadsides of the 19th century the victims now are Timothy Evans, Marilyn Monroe, miners buried alive and lifeboatmen drowned.'</p> <p><strong>A drive through the quiet Berkshire countryside to </strong>the attractive town of Aldermaston today provides a telling reminder of the marchers' failure to 'close the bloody place down'. Head out of town towards Tadley and you immediately encounter the imposing fences, Ministry of Defence warning signs and general air of menace surrounding the five-mile perimeter of the Atomic Weapons Establishment. 'We still get a few protesters down here from time to time,' says the barman in one of the local pubs. 'Nobody takes much notice of them and they go away again.'</p> <p>While other events and issues - from Vietnam to Iraq and feminism to fascism - lay in wait to stir the social conscience of new generations, the realisation that music ultimately can't change history knocked the political heart out of the folk revival. </p> <p>'The day folkies forgot they were dealing with political songs was the day it almost became unglued,' says Martin Carthy. 'We took it for granted but it shocked me in 1982 when the Falklands war was happening and you weren't hearing songs about it. It made me so angry I wrote one - 'Company Policy'. I also remember appearing at a festival in Telford with the Watersons and Jim Woodland played his song 'Ghost Story' (criticising the Falklands war) and he was booed. That's when I realised how much things had changed.'</p> <p>If the tradition of musical dissent has an enduring anthem, it's 'The World Turned Upside Down', written by Leon Rosselson about the Diggers' uprising of 1649 when Gerrard Winstanley led a small, ragged group to challenge the notion of landownership and private property to set up their own agricultural colony on common land in, of all places, the modern Surrey stockbroker belt of St George's Hill, Weybridge. It was a peaceful enterprise doomed to a swift and savage destruction by fearful local landowners, but with its eternal truths and stirring theme, 'The World Turned Upside Down' still hits a raw nerve and, after dozens of cover versions, remains the prince of protest songs.</p> <p>Now 73, Leon Rosselson has never achieved fame or fortune and the uncompromising and often controversial nature of his songwriting (his 'Stand Up For Judas' re-assessing Judas as an heroic revolutionary incited particular fury in religious circles) has ensured an almost blanket absence of radio play and even on a British folk scene starting to thrive again, he remains something of a peripheral figure. Others also continue to fly the political flag - Robb Johnson, Pete Morton, Seize the Day, and David Ferrard spring to mind, while the biennial Raise Your Banners festival in Bradford produces an avalanche of political songwriters - but Rosselson has maintained a unique role for 50 years. His latest album, A Proper State, is as lyrically acidic, barbed and driven as ever; he still gigs regularly and he still gets up people's noses.</p> <p>'It's often been said that folk music was a communist conspiracy, particularly in America, and to an extent that's true,' says Rosselson. 'In the Fifties there was a big discussion in the Communist Party about the correct music to lead the workers to the barricades. In the Thirties the Communist Party sent people to the mining areas of the Appalachians to politicise the miners - 'Which Side Are You On?' was written in the Thirties - and before that there were the Wobblies, who were a great singing union, so there was a tradition in America of radical songwriting. At some point it was decided that folk music was the music of the people and was therefore the correct music to revolutionise the working class.'</p> <p>When Eric Clapton drunkenly declared support for Enoch Powell in 1976 and David Bowie made his infamous (and soon retracted) comment in Playboy magazine about Britain being ready for a fascist leader, Rock Against Racism adopted rock as the political music of choice and the folk songwriters were blown out of the water.</p> <p>'I don't think music can politicise and revolutionise, it never did,' says Rosselson. 'You couldn't have had Folk Against Racism - it wouldn't have done anything. It's not the words that do it, it's the sound and the whole association of ideas. Rock Against Racism was effective, but not because of the content of the songs. I don't believe a song can change people's beliefs. It's not the way music works. What it can do is strengthen social movements. Music was very important in giving people hope and encouragement in South Africa. But I don't believe the idea that music can somehow turn people into revolutionaries.'</p> <p>'A song will change nothing but the consequences of performing a song are more than just individuals listening to it,' says Rosselson's former singing partner Roy Bailey, who was at the start of that 1958 Aldermaston march, but didn't actually make the trip. 'The function of song is to make audiences aware that others share their beliefs. Sometimes I sing songs that the audience find difficult. I sing one at the moment about Palestine which they're not sure about, but because it's in the context of all the other things they're right on about they find it hard to dismiss.'</p> <p>Bailey now regularly performs a popular show about the history of dissent with Tony Benn, who was also on that first Aldermaston march. While Benn launches into rambling but compelling anecdotes on political activism, Bailey intersperses the discourse with songs illustrating the point.</p> <p>'Music has always inspired me,' says Benn, who gave up being an MP in 2001 'to devote more time to politics'. A fan of 'Paul Robeson, colliery bands, folk song and radical music', he first met Roy Bailey in 1974. 'Music has the power to inspire others. It was important in the Aldermaston marches, which had a big influence on making people realise that nuclear weapons are very expensive and highly dangerous. Bob Geldof isn't the answer to world poverty but he can inspire other people to make a difference. In the show I do with Roy we remind people they're not the first people to think war is wrong.'</p> <p>Rock and punk may have crippled folk in terms of public perception, but its spirit - and some of its songs - lived on in future struggles. Confirmed Clash disciple Billy Bragg went around the country doing his bit for the miners strikers in 1984 and was shocked to find the most militant and articulate songs he heard came from those associated with the folk movement - specifically Leon Rosselson and Dick Gaughan. 'That whole Aldermaston tradition came to the fore again. I went up to do gigs in the coalfields and found their songs were more political than mine and it made me rethink what I was doing. In the Sixties they still believed music should change the world and they were part of a struggle so that when people like me came along to write political songs we got a fair hearing. And topical songs have a habit of becoming topical again. Instead of the Falklands, just read Afghanistan.'</p> <p>Why aren't people writing political songs any more, Billy? 'They are - you're just looking in the wrong places. You may not find it from white boys with guitars but in hip hop and world music you'll find plenty of bands with the same principles.'</p> <p>Yet those who marched to Aldermaston in the freezing cold 50 years ago left an indelible legacy. The goalposts have shifted and the causes are different, but the hope lives on and Leon Rosselson, Karl Dallas and Peggy Seeger would walk back to Aldermaston tomorrow if they thought it would do any good. 'We still feel so desperate and depressed about so many things,' says Seeger. 'Like global warming. How do you deal with that? You can't march against global warming, can you?'</p> <p>She stops for a second, looks down and sighs. 'But we've got to keep trying and I've got to keep singing about these things. It's what I do...'</p> <h2>Michael Foot on making a stand</h2> <p>It was the novelty of nuclear weapons, plus the evidence of the lingering torture that radiation could inflict, which gave the main impetus to the creation of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Nothing so evil had ever happened in our world before. Why had the truth about the crimes committed both at Hiroshima and Nagasaki not percolated to the outside world?</p> <p>In February 1958 we set up a committee that included Bertrand Russell, JB Priestley and Canon Collins of St Paul's Cathedral, among others. I was there representing Tribune, which had already played a leading part in reporting the general H-bomb debates in the country. </p> <p>For many of us of that period and generation, it was CND that best expressed the response which the human race must make to the bomb: the moral outrage that such an instrument should ever have been invented, the awareness that a new kind of politics would be needed to bring it under control, the determination to act together at once, whatever the cynics or sceptics might say.</p> <p>The first Aldermaston march was bigger than any of us had expected, with so many people from all generations, from all walks of life and from all over the country showing the strength of feeling about the horrors of nuclear war.</p> <p>The music was crucial in rallying support and the songs kept up the spirit of the marchers. I feel very proud to have been a part of it.</p> <p>But today, far from slowing down, the pace of the arms race is accelerating and its dangers are as great as ever. Why are we still spending billions of pounds on weapons that could destroy the world? We must continue to campaign against them. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Michael Foot was leader of the Labour Party from 1980-83.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The case study</strong></p> <p>In her small, windowless office a short walk from London Bridge, Liberty's director, Shami Chakrabarti, puts the finishing touches to an email and, smiling nervously, shakes Record Doctor's hand. 'My young colleagues are worried about me doing this,' she says. Chakrabarti, 39, swivels in her chair and points upstairs to where her workmates are chatting, all three of whom look no older than 25. 'They are convinced that I'm not cool enough,' she says, 'and that I might have a Gordon Brown/Arctic Monkeys moment.'</p> <p>Her colleagues have no worries on that score. Unlike the Prime Minister - who, in 2006, was ridiculed for feigning an affinity with Alex Turner's group of angelic upstarts in a bid to modify his dour public image - the human rights and civil liberties campaigner is too media-literate to fall into such traps. Besides, she genuinely likes the Arctic Monkeys ('No, I didn't buy their album on Gordon Brown's recommendation'), though nowhere near as much as the Kaiser Chiefs and Coventry's the Enemy, with whom she is obsessed.</p> <p>'Their album, We'll Live and Die in These Towns, is extraordinary. Extraordinary,' she says, emphasising her regard for the band she chanced upon via her husband. 'The album says \"Made in Coventry with pride\", and you feel a little bit of this contemporary English anger that doesn't have to be nasty and racist. It can be quite altruistic and idealistic.'</p> <p>You might expect the erstwhile barrister to be equally excited by the bands - the Jam, Oasis, the Specials, the Clash - whose impact on the Enemy is obvious. Not so. 'No, I prefer the Enemy, and I don't know why that is. Maybe the others were a bit too ... boysy.' Actually, she says, she was quite fond of Oasis, whose 'Wonderwall' is 'a great, great song'. 'But during the Britpop years I was a bit more into Blur. There was more wit and complexity in their lyrics, and lyrics are very important to me.'</p> <p>Oddly, much as she loves the Enemy and Kaiser Chiefs' 'The Angry Mob', a snippet of which she quotes, Chakrabarti namechecks few political lyricists. In fact, in her early teens, then living in north London with a mother who would sing Joan Baez songs and a father 'who was into arguments', her favourite wordsmiths were Sting and David Bowie, neither of whom is known for trenchant critiques of unjust governmental policy.</p> <p>'But politics isn't just about lyrics that concern the miners' strike. Eleanor Roosevelt, who was a great human rights activist of the postwar period, said that human rights begin in small places close to home, places so small you'll never find them on a map. And that can be true of music that moves you in a political way. A song may not seem that political - it can just be about wanting to make someone get out of bed.'</p> <p>No album energises her quite like Hunky Dory, 'which represents the phase in Bowie's life I love the most'. It has been her ideal set since she was 13 when, years before the onset of responsibility, Chakrabarti had the time to be 'a proper fan' and would scan the lyric sheet, mouthing every word. Now the mother of a six-year-old son, she no longer has the time to keep pace with new music, let alone find space in her schedule for a 'bop'.</p> <p>'Isn't that sad?' she says, smiling to herself. 'The sad middle-aged woman with childcare issues who doesn't get a bop as much as she used to.'</p> <p>Even if she did clear space in her diary, 'bopping' wouldn't top Chakrabarti's must-do list. Electronic music hasn't figured in her life since 1981 when she saw Ultravox and bought OMD's Architecture and Morality. 'How do I feel about that album now?' She thinks long and hard. 'Well, I haven't played it in years, but you need guitars. It's part of the restless soul,' she adds, somewhat obliquely. 'It all comes back to guitars in the end.'</p> <p>Guitars and men, to be precise. Thus far Chakrabarti hasn't mentioned any women. 'No, I haven't, have I? But there was a time when the whole single girl with a guitar or piano thing appealed. My first date with my husband was soundtracked by Tori Amos, and I went through The Year Of Tracy Chapman.' Then there was Alex Parks, the Fame Academy winner who was dropped by Polydor in 2006. 'I thought she would be the new Annie Lennox. I wonder what she is doing now. What a voice.'</p> <p>Which isn't something many people say of Billy Bragg. But then the Bard of Barking has other qualities. 'How can you not like him? He's got attitude and wit.' Chakrabarti recounts two lines of 'Between the Wars' and, chuckling, nods to where Record Doctor is sat. 'He has been inside the Liberty palace and plonked himself down on that very chair. And I'll tell you what,' she says, conspiratorially, whispering lest her colleagues be attempting to eavesdrop, 'everyone wanted to bring something to my office that day. You. Could. Not. Keep. The. Young. Women. Away.'</p> <p><strong>The symptoms - her favourites</strong></p> <p><strong>David Bowie </strong><br><strong>Life on Mars </strong> (EMI)</p> <p>'I was introduced to this song by an older teenager and it lit a flame yet to go out. The combination of ballad and social commentary resonates with restless teenage spirits everywhere.'</p> <p><strong>U2 </strong><br><strong>Pride </strong>(Mercury)</p> <p>'U2 weren't my favourite band during the Eighties but boy, haven't they stood the test of time? This tribute to Martin Luther King deals with the politics by way of a simple melody and allegorical lyric that doesn't ram the message down your throat. An anthem for human rights.'</p> <p><strong>Amy Winehouse </strong><br><strong>Back to Black </strong> (Island) </p> <p>'She is simply a musical genius. \"We only said goodbye with words.\" It's extraordinary that one so young should be able to write such a beautiful, tortured love song, let alone sing it like a soul legend.' </p> <p><strong>Coldplay </strong><br><strong>The Scientist </strong>(Parlophone)</p> <p>'Great pop isn't rocket science. It all comes back to a few chords, piano, guitar and lyric of lost love - and Coldplay make it seem so simple. The unusual lyric also reminds me of the constant dynamic between faith and reason that makes the human condition.'</p> <p><strong>The diagnosis</strong></p> <p>It has been a while since the Patient was last affected by a woman's voice so PJ Harvey's cryptic, eldritch 'The Devil' was the first song to be dispatched. Damon Albarn's life, post-Blur, has passed the Patient by, prompting the Doctor to chuck into the mix a Mali Music number, 'Sunset Coming On'. Hunky Dory may be her desert island disc, but what would she make of John Howard's sober cover of 'The Bewlay Brothers', one of the set's standouts? What, too, would she make of Kieran Hebden's Four Tet and the folk-meets-urbane-techno vibe of 'She Moves She', given her aversion to electronica?</p> <p>Billy Bragg aside, the Patient is indifferent to political wordsmiths. None the less, Eighties Marxist troupe the Redskins ('Kick Over the Statues') may cause her to re-evaluate her stance. Failing that, the Doctor thought, she might enjoy the Ruts, whose 'S.U.S.' was triggered by the hated stop and search law.</p> <p>Finally, as the Patient is a sucker for guitars, she was sent 'It's My Own Cheating Heart That Makes Me Cry' from Glasvegas's magnificent first set.</p> <p>The Patient liked Glasvegas. No: the Patient loved Glasvegas. Currently, they are her favourite band extant. </p> <p><strong>The cure</strong></p> <p>'They are what rock music is all about - someone singing their heart out with a guitar. I will buy their album the day that it comes out. It was worth doing this entire exercise just to be introduced to them, in fact.'</p> <p>Neither PJ Harvey, right, nor Damon Albarn proved quite so life-changing, though she was fond of both. The former grew more 'atmospheric' with each listen, while the latter made the Patient think that she 'should have kept the faith after Blur.

  "<p>Russian bombers and artillery yesterday widened their attack against Georgian forces with strikes against towns and military bases across the country in a dangerous escalation of the two-day-old war. Moscow appeared determined to dismantle Georgia's military capability in punishment for its rival's brutal attempt to regain control of the breakaway enclave of South Ossetia.</p> <p>Russia's Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin, last night insisted that its actions were 'legitimate' and called on Georgia to end its 'aggression' against the separatist province.</p> <p>As the civilian casualties escalated on both sides, Georgia's military adventure seemed to be unravelling. President Mikheil Saakashvili demanded a ceasefire from Russia and implored the West to intervene to help him. Georgia's difficulties deepened further as separatists in a second pro-Russian breakaway Georgian republic - Abkhazia - joined the conflict, attacking Georgian forces in the contested upper Kodori Gorge.</p> <p>Despite Saakashvili's call for a ceasefire - and the announcement that a combined EU, UN and US delegation was flying to Georgia to broker a cessation of hostilities - Russia insisted there would be no ceasefire until all Georgian troops had withdrawn from South Ossetia, which declared its independence from Georgia after a war in 1992. </p> <p>'The first thing needed is to ... make the Georgians return to their positions and re-establish the status quo we had before,' Russia's Nato ambassador, Dmitry Rogozin, said in Brussels. He said that there could be 'no consultations' until that precondition had been met.</p> <p>Rogozin said Russian troops had entered South Ossetia to protect Russian peacekeepers and civilians. He added - unconvincingly given the air raids - that Russia was not conducting any military operation against Georgia outside the conflict zone in South Ossetia.</p> <p>The latest moves come amid concern over the civilian death toll on both sides, which appeared to have reached 2,000 yesterday. The first horrific images began emerging from the Georgian town of Gori, bombed yesterday by Russian jets, where up to 60 civilians died when bombs landed on two apartment blocks in a town that Georgia has been using as a military staging post for its assault on South Ossetia.</p> <p>Putin - who had attended the opening of the Olympic Games in Beijing, where he discussed the crisis with President George Bush - hurried back to Russia yesterday, arriving in the North Ossetian city of Vladikavkaz to meet refugees.</p> <p>In Tskhinvali, capital of South Ossetia and centre of the worst of the fighting, Russian officials said that up to 2,000 civilians had been killed during Georgia's assault on Friday. Georgia has reported 129 soldiers and civilians dead and more than 700 injured.</p> <p>Bush said that the Russian attacks on Georgia marked a 'dangerous escalation' of the crisis and urged Moscow to halt the bombing. Russia accused the West of contributing to the violence by selling arms to Georgia. Ukraine, a former Soviet republic whose pro-Western government wants membership of Nato and the EU, had encouraged Georgia to carry out 'ethnic cleansing' in South Ossetia, the Russian Foreign Ministry said.</p> <p>In Tskhinvali - which both sides claimed to be holding yesterday - eyewitnesses told The Observer Georgian troops and Russian special forces and armour from the 58th Army continued to contest the badly damaged city.</p> <p>Amid claims of atrocities on both sides, Russians and Georgians accused each other of 'genocide' and 'ethnic cleansing'. South Ossetian refugees arriving in Vladikavkaz told The Observer that rampaging Georgian forces had 'shot, kidnapped and burnt to death' villagers and residents of Tskhinvali.</p> <p>Last night, French president and current holder of the European Union presidency, Nicolas Sarkozy, proposed a three-point plan including an immediate halt to the hostilities and full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia. Mr Sarkozy's office said in a statement that he planned to meet EU foreign ministers next week to assess the situation and consider ways to end the conflict.</p>",
  "<p>House prices: still the favourite dinner party topic of a nation obsessed by property. But how often do you hear anyone say: 'Well I would buy my first flat if it wasn't for that onerous stamp duty keeping me off the ladder'?</p> <p>When I bought mine 18 months ago, at the same time as many of my friends were also buying or saving to buy, we moaned about solicitors' fees, survey fees, mortgage fees and the time it had taken for us to save for a deposit. </p> <p>I'm sure we mentioned stamp duty at some point - after all, it's one element of a big package of costs. Yet much of the coverage in last week's newspapers gave the impression that stamp duty is the only stumbling block preventing people buying their first home. Now Alistair Darling is apparently considering a stamp duty holiday, or a deferral of the payment, in order to encourage first-time buyers back into the market. </p> <p>Supporters for this idea have come out in their droves, chief among them the mortgage lenders. Yet not only is a stamp duty suspension (as opposed to a reassessment of the stamp duty thresholds, which is a different thing altogether) a dangerous knee-jerk reaction from a government feeling under pressure to kick-start a falling housing market, the fact that lenders are collectively outraged by the rising cost of stamp duty smacks of hypocrisy.</p> <p>A survey last week showed how lenders have put up their 'arrangement fees' by 10 per cent in the past year, bringing the average to \u00a31,023. Some charge much more than this, particularly if you want the better rates. Check any online talkboard and you'll find much more vitriol about these than you will about stamp duty. </p> <p>And a poll last week on <a href=\"http://www.Guardian.co.uk\">Guardian.co.uk</a> showed just how little support such a move would get from buyers. Eighty per cent of the 1,600 who responded said the abolition of stamp duty would not be enough to make them buy. This is because in the current market a suspension of stamp duty will make little difference when people can't get a mortgage. I know this as keenly as any first-time buyer. I put down a 10 per cent deposit, as we on Cash have always recommended first-time buyers do. Now, coming up to remortgage, I am struggling to get a rate lower than my current mortgage lender's standard variable rate because 10 per cent equity is no longer considered a safe bet by lenders. I wouldn't encourage any first-time buyer to get on the ladder at the moment.</p> <p>As long as the government refrains from ill-thought-out short-term measures to prop up a housing market in need of correction, prices will continue to come down. And that is the best thing for anyone looking to buy a property they cannot, at the moment, afford. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>The Observer </strong>has been the only newspaper in the past year to repeatedly highlight the plight of those who rely on heating oil to warm their homes. But good news for those households could at last be afoot following the publication of a select committee report that puts pressure on Ofgem and the government to act. </p> <p>While soaring gas prices have brought the average UK household dual fuel bill to \u00a31,200, those using heating oil have seen their average annual spend rise from \u00a31,000 to nearly \u00a31,900. Yet none of these households has access to any of the social tariffs on offer to those on mains gas, despite the fact that many thousands of them will be in 'fuel poverty'. </p> <p>Among other things, the select committee report recommends that households not on the gas network now be covered by both energy regulator Ofgem and the soon-to-be successor to consumer watchdog Energywatch, the National Consumer Council. It also recommends the government targets any increase in the money its puts toward fuel poverty into schemes to provide assistance to those not able to access mains gas.</p> <p>There is a clearly long way to go, but for all readers who are not on mains gas and have contacted us to share their stories over the past year, we hope that this is the beginning of the end of unfair prices.</p>",
  "<p>Borrowers breathing more easily after a recent fall in home loan rates are being hit by rising arrangement fees, new research shows. While the average rate on a two-year fix has fallen from 7.08 per cent in July to 6.9 per cent today, according to Moneyfacts, the average fee has climbed by nearly \u00a3100 to \u00a31,023.</p> <p>'Borrowers have not benefited as much from rate reductions as expected,' warns Darren Cook of Moneyfacts. </p> <p>A \u00a3150,000 loan at 6.9 instead of 7.05 per cent represents a 0.15 percentage point decrease, but the \u00a3100 average fee increase means that, in real terms, it is only a 0.09 per cent fall.</p> <p>However, loan rates do look set to fall further still, with 'swap rates' - those at which banks and building societies are prepared to lend to each other on money markets - falling to their lowest level since early April, Cook said.</p> <p>'The predictions are that we should see further decreases in fixed rates from high-street lenders before too long. Anyone looking for a mortgage deal should make sure they consider the true cost and not just look at the headline rate that is being offered.'</p> <p>But while rates have been falling for those with chunky deposits to put down on new homes, those for borrowers with loan-to-values (LTVs) above 75 to 80 per cent will still struggle to grab a cheap deal. Britannia building society last week introduced a new rate of 5.94 per cent for borrowers with a 75 per cent LTV whereas those with anything higher up to 90 per cent must pay 6.69 per cent.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Abbey lowered the rates on some of its two- and three-year fixed rate and tracker deals by up to 0.10 percentage points. A two-year tracker now starts from 5.89 per cent with a \u00a3995 fee but - again - only if you have a 75 per cent LTV. </p> <h2>Start saving - then double your deposit </h2> <p>First-time buyers are being offered a helping hand from Halifax and housebuilder Persimmon Homes. Under a scheme called 'double your deposit', they will be able to save up to \u00a35,000 - which will be matched pound for pound by Persimmon.</p> <p>To benefit from the scheme, aspiring homeowners must first make regular deposits into a Halifax or Bank of Scotland savings account for a minimum of six months. If the upper savings limit of \u00a35,000 is reached, Persimmon would also add \u00a35,000, so buyers would have a \u00a310,000 deposit for a house. </p> <p>Persimmon Homes says the scheme will help make a 'real difference' in helping people getting on to the property ladder. </p> <p>Mike Bottomley from the Halifax said: 'This is a great deal for first-time buyers. By saving regularly, potential homeowners are planning for the financial commitment of buying their first home. Doubling their deposit in this way should be a major incentive.'</p> <p>First-time buyers can pick any savings accounts from Halifax or the Bank of Scotland, including the Halifax Web Saver Extra, which requires a minimum opening deposit of \u00a31 and pays 6 per cent interest. </p> <h2>What you can pay for just one call a day </h2> <p>If you're going overseas on holiday and phoning home every day to check on the children, be careful - that short call could prove expensive. </p> <p>Research from the Post Office reveals that the cost of making a five-minute phone call back to the UK every day for a week on your mobile could reach around \u00a345, if you happen to be in Turkey (based on a rate of \u00a31.30 a minute, the lowest of the standard network rates), or at least \u00a312 if you're in Spain, France or Greece.</p> <p>Meanwhile, text addicts could end up spending nearly \u00a320 a week on messages if they send 10 texts a day (based on the lowest rate of 25p per text sent while overseas). </p> <p>Helen Warburton, head of travel at the Post Office, said: 'Keep the phone for emergencies and turn the answer-machine facility off to avoid expensive incoming calls.'</p> <p>She estimates that a family of four could save more than \u00a370 in typical holiday living costs just by using mobile phones more moderately. </p> <h2>Poll puts housing boost plan in doubt</h2> <p>Alistair Darling's hopes of reinvigorating the housing market by letting buyers take a stamp duty holiday could be dashed if the results of a theguardian.com/money poll are to be believed. Following media speculation about the plans last week, Guardian Money asked readers if being able to put off paying the tax would encourage them to enter the market. </p> <p>More than 1,600 voted, with an overwhelming 79 per cent saying some kind of payment holiday would not encourage them to buy. Only one in five said they would be persuaded to change their plans by a deferral of the tax, which is charged at 1 per cent on sales worth over \u00a3125,000, 3 per cent on sales worth more than \u00a3250,000 and 4 per cent where a property changes hands.</p> <p>The change, rumoured to be part of package of measures to kick-start the market that will be announced in September, did have the support of mortgage lenders and house builders, but some commentators warned that it could do more harm than good in the short term with budding homebuyers putting their plans on hold until a change is officially announced.</p>",

  "<p>The land around Paraguay's capital, Asunci\u00f3n, sown with its fields of soya, tells the country's story. It is a potentially rich area, dominated by a few large landowners, capable of moving swiftly to take advantage of the insatiable hunger for one of the world's most versatile crops. </p> <p>It is in sharp contrast with the realities of San Pedro province, where almost every encounter reveals a more common reality in Paraguay - that this is a poor country of landless, illiterate peasants living on the margins and off a few dollars a day. </p> <p>But these days the sense of hopelessness that has dominated the country's majority for so long seems on the point of being swept away. At a roadside stop, Rosana, a seller of terer\u00e9 cold herbal tea, touched her chest and declared: 'I follow Lugo, from the bottom of my heart. There is nobody like him, nobody. He is the hope. God sent us this man to free and protect us.' </p> <p>Fernando Lugo is known in these parts as the Good One, the Red Bishop, the Bishop of the Poor. As of Friday, he will have a new title: President of Paraguay. Other Presidents in Latin America are already embracing him as one of their own. He is, in their view, part of the 'pink tide' carrying the continent to the left, as have Venezuela's Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Brazil's Lula. That might worry others. As Evo Morales, Bolivia's first indigenous Indian President, has said to Lugo: 'Welcome to the axis of evil.'</p> <p>Some do believe Lugo crossed to the dark side when, in January 2006, he left the priesthood and his episcopal see to become a politician. But Lugo views himself as an independent, not seduced by more radical left-wing leaders, and he has not turned his back on Christianity. His tone has been moderate and his approach to land reform is incremental. </p> <p>But how did this long-time priest come to power? </p> <p>In Asunci\u00f3n, on the bank opposite the presidential palace, two slum-dwellers, Dionisio and Miguel, offered an explanation on a chessboard with soft-drink caps instead of pieces. 'You see, the reds are the Colorados; they used to win by cheating,' explained Dionisio. 'I am the whites, which represent hope. And now I am winning. This is how things should be now. We need to erase such a terrible Colorado legacy.'</p> <p>For six decades, the political chessboard was dominated by one party, the Colorado party. From 1947, through war, dictatorship and democracy, it was the leading party. For 34 of those 61 years, it was dominated by one man, General Alfredo Stroessner, but the dictator needed the party's electoral machine to reinforce his control. With politics so tainted, Paraguayans embraced a man who promised to clear the temple of the merchants of corruption - Lugo. </p> <p>In a country where priests tend to be rightwingers, Lugo had to earn trust. He became a priest in the late 1970s, served as a missionary in Ecuador and embraced 'liberation theology' and its focus on the poor. Yet, despite Rome's suspicion of what it viewed as a subversive movement, Lugo slowly moved up the hierarchy to become a bishop in 1994. In his 11 years in San Pedro, he worked with peasant movements seeking land reform. Gradually he came to feel that he could change more as a politician. The moment came in March 2006, when he helped lead an opposition rally in Asunci\u00f3n. 'He went on stage to give a speech... He went up there as a bishop, and came back as President,' says writer and political analyst Alfredo Boccia. </p> <p>Lugo resigned from the priesthood that December and helped to create a new political movement, Tekojoja, which means 'life in equality' in Guaran\u00ed, the indigenous language. Lugo, as many see it, has finally ended the 'transition' to democracy after the dictatorship. As Boccia noted: 'For the first time in our history, there is a power transfer without a coup, without bullets, without bloodshed, without fighting among brothers.' Last week Pope Benedict XVI gave him permission to resign as bishop.</p> <p>Lugo now needs to turn Paraguay to the future, which is a daunting task. Sitting in his party's office, Lugo appeared comfortable with the responsibility. A bespectacled man with greying hair, a white beard and a deep laugh, Lugo said: 'The first thing we want to do is to tidy up the house. We are discovering so much chaos here that one wants to cry,' he told The Observer. 'We want this country to regain its dignity, to be credible, to wipe out the stigma of being a pirate country' - a reference to Paraguay's industrial-scale production of marijuana and bootlegs and to its role as a conduit for weapons. </p> <p>Beyond that, he highlights Paraguay's ownership rights over part of the world's biggest hydro-electric dam, at Itaip\u00fa close to the Iguazu falls, which it shares with Brazil. Under a deal signed in 1973 by two dictators, Paraguay continues to sell surplus electricity to Brazil at way below the market price. 'We believe it is a fair, just and reasonable claim . . . and we will be firm with it,' Lugo said. </p> <p>But it is in red-earth lands like San Pedro that Lugo may face his toughest challenge. 'Land tenancy here is something scandalous. We cannot start real change without touching that infamous structure,' Lugo said. And that means a major challenge to the social structure. Paraguay is the world's fourth-biggest soya exporter, but production is dominated by a few landlords, most of Brazilian origin. Many Paraguayans have no title to their land; one in threeww lives in poverty.</p> <p>Lugo does not lack faith in his flock. 'Where there is a scream coming from the poor people, where there is sweat, where people are shoeless, we will be there. Because in such people there is a resurrection; if that exists there, then there is resurrection for Paraguay.'</p> <h2>The Latin Left </h2> <p><strong>Venezuela</strong></p> <p>Hugo Ch\u00e1vez was swept to power in 1998 with his vision of creating a 21st-century socialist state.

  "<p>Cory Booker's message was clear. Unveiling a plaque to commemorate deadly race riots in his city 41 years ago, the young black Mayor of Newark, New Jersey, was thinking of the future as much as the past. Though 26 people died in the troubles and the city turned into a byword for racial tensions and crime, Booker was determined not to make the event about America's past racism and segregation.</p> <p>'I am of a different generation,' he told a crowd of onlookers in the stifling heat of a Newark summer's day. 'I have never in my life seen a sign, but in a museum, that says \"Whites only\". I am from a generation that came about in a different era.'</p> <p>Such honest words, wilfully breaking free from the Sixties civil rights struggle, would once have been unthinkable from a leading black politician, especially when speaking to a mostly black audience. But now, as Barack Obama runs to be America's first black President, a new cadre of so-called 'post-racial' black politicians have moved to the fore. They are changing the face of black American politics.</p> <p>Shaking off the traditional black power structures of civil rights groups and the black church, they have distanced themselves from figures such as Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. They have also posed a challenge to established black politicians with roots in the old civil rights era, such as South Carolina congressman Jim Clyburn and Georgia congressman John Lewis. The new politicians have based their appeal on anything but race. They have forged voter coalitions across racial boundaries, including whites and Hispanics. And it has worked. </p> <p>Booker is a hugely popular mayor in Newark. He is not alone. Deval Patrick has become the first black governor of heavily white Massachusetts. David Paterson is the first black governor of New York. Adrian Fenty, aged just 37, is the young black mayor of Washington DC, and a world away from the black politicians that came before him. In Atlanta the black mayor, Shirley Franklin, is hugely popular with the powerful white business community. </p> <p>All of them - like Obama - have won electoral success by seeking to move beyond racial identity. They could be the first trickles of a coming flood. 'This surge of black politicians running post-racial campaigns is new. But if Obama wins the White House we are going to see a major shift towards them,' said Caroline Heldman, a political scientist at California's Occidental College.</p> <p>Booker looks every inch the new black politician. He is handsome and young and wears dapper suits. He has an impressive educational background: a degree from Stanford and a Rhodes Scholar. He grew up in a mostly white town in New Jersey, the son of IBM executives.</p> <p>Yet here he is as the mayor of Newark, a city that, for much of America, has come to mean rampant crime and sprawling black ghettos. He is now turning it around. Booker has substantially reduced violent crime. He has reformed the police force and brought high-profile companies to the city. He is a relentlessly upbeat advocate for the city despite its reputation.</p> <p>That reputation was largely born in 1967. After rumours spread that white police had beaten a black taxi driver, riots broke out that cost 26 lives, injured more than 700 and saw the National Guard brought onto the streets. It resulted in the flight of the white middle class, leaving behind an impoverished black populace. Memories run deep here. Watching the plaque being unveiled was Atno Smith, who grew up near where the riot started. 'You call it a riot,' he said 'We call it a rebellion. You can call it a police riot if you like. Or a National Guard riot.'</p> <p>Such sentiments have been common in black American politics for a generation; defined by a sense of injustice and the notion that street protest was the best way to address black concerns. The TV image of Sharpton and Jackson leading a march to protest at a police shooting or a racially motivated murder has become a cultural signpost for modern American life. But Obama, Booker and others are seeking to change that. </p> <p>In his memorial speech, Booker outlined a post-racial future for black Americans and his constant theme was to move on from the civil rights era. 'We do not want these stories or these memories to overcome us and undermine us; to trap us in our history,' he said.</p> <p>That echoes the themes of Obama, who only openly addressed the issue of race when his pastor, the Rev Jeremiah Wright, became a damaging campaign issue after making comments including blaming America for the 11 September attacks and claiming the government had secretly invented HIV 'as a means of genocide against people of colour'. </p> <p>Indeed, Obama has been frequently at pains to call on black Americans to take responsibility for their lives. He has spoken at black churches and aggressively pushed the need for individual blacks, especially young fathers, to look after their families better. That theme has earned the ire of older figures such as Jackson, whose fury at Obama recently spilled out when a microphone in a TV studio picked up Jackson admitting he wanted to '... cut his nuts out'.</p> <p>The new generation of black politicians has forged on regardless and, to some extent, they have succeeded in removing race from their campaigns. When Paterson replaced Eliot Spitzer as New York's governor, much was made of the fact Paterson was blind. His race was rarely mentioned. Patrick and Franklin's paths to power unfolded in similar ways, with race playing little overt role. </p> <p>In many ways, these politicians reflect the emergence of a black middle class that has moved to the same suburbs as their white counterparts and works in the same professional jobs. A recent study for Radio One, a black broadcasting company, found huge generational discrepancies among black Americans. It found younger blacks in their thirties and forties were twice as likely to say society focused too much on black oppression as their parents' generation. They were also markedly more optimistic about the future.</p> <p>That attitude can be found even on the streets of Newark where the riots began. William Steele, who is black, said Booker had the right message: 'Cory Booker is just laying it out there. That what we need to do is just stand up. He is giving people a sense of responsibility that if you want some money, then you have to get out there and get a job. It does not matter if you are black or white.'</p> <p>It is not as easy as that. The truth is far more complex than a flood of newspaper headlines greeting the premature dawn of a non-racial future.</p> <p>It is certainly easy to find dissenting Newark voices, who believe the new black politicians are abandoning the real concerns of black people. Opposite the police station on which the memorial plaque now hangs, a large estate of new housing has been built. The area used to be a notorious 'project' but is now full of smart, tidy homes. To many that is a sign of progress, but not for Theresa Manning. She says Booker - and black politicians like him - have forgotten the poorest of the poor in her city in favour of embryonic gentrification. </p> <p>'They knock down a project where we live and then build these new houses. But we can't afford to live in them,' she said 'They are trying to [push] us out of Newark. But where we gonna go?'</p> <p>There is a fear that the declining influence of old-style black protest politics will mean the new black politicians will be able to ignore disadvantaged black communities or blame them for their own situation. But the fact is that black America is a very different world from the rest of the US. </p> <p>On average, black American men live seven years less than other racial groups. They are five times more likely to die of Aids. More than three times as many blacks live in prison cells than live in university halls. Many experts fear that electing Obama - or other political leaders - on a 'non-racial' basis would allow these issues to be swept under the carpet. 'There is a sense that this might be the potential downside of the triumph of tokenism,' said Devin Fergus, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University. </p> <p>Given the nature of the problems still facing black America, many black commentators believe there is still a justification for the confrontational, race-based politics of old hands such as Sharpton and Jackson. Indeed, it was noticeable in Obama's epic nomination battle with Hillary Clinton that establishment black politicians were far cooler about Obama than the black Democratic electorate. Many older black mayors, congressmen and senators ended up firmly in the Clinton camp or stayed on the sidelines until near the very end. 'People are worried that these post-racial politicians will not be able to forcibly address real black issues,' said Andra Gillespie, a political scientist at Emory University who is writing a book on Booker.</p> <p>On the streets of America's inner cities, that same sentiment can be found, albeit expressed in simpler language. It often takes the form of a resentment of the education of the new black politicians and a belief that they do not understand what it means to be black in America. Obama has come under sustained criticism for his Hawaiian upbringing and his Kenyan - not black American - family background. Even in Newark, Booker is not immune. Manning is not shy about attacking what she sees as Booker's privileged upbringing in a wealthy white suburb. The vehemence of her words, delivered on a street corner as Booker prepared to get back in his SUV, jarred starkly with the positive post-racial rhetoric of the mayor's speech. 'Cory Booker did not know what it means to be black. He had to learn how to be black,' Manning said.</p> <p>Her words perhaps deliberately echoed a famous campaign taunt used by Booker's predecessor as mayor, Sharpe James. James, who ran Newark for two decades as a classic old-school black politician, once said of Booker: 'You have to learn how to be African-American and we don't have time to train you.' But how times have changed. Booker is now mayor and James has been jailed on corruption charges.</p> <p>In many black intellectual circles there is now a fierce argument over whether the new 'post-racial' campaigns are simply a means to an end - that sacrificing black identity politics will allow black leaders to better tackle racial injustice. Or are they, paradoxically, a bad thing for many poor black communities whose concerns could be abandoned.</p> <p>The jury is out. Critics say politicians such as Booker and Obama, by raising issues such as absent black fathers, are pandering to the racism of the white majority in order to win office. 'Some think the election of Obama could be a double-edged sword. Some of what he has said could give strength to those who falsely argue black Americans are marginalised by their own choices,' Fergus said. </p> <p>But others say the opposite. They say the new generation of black politicians simply want to make all their constituents' lives better and move beyond race. Getting elected first is key, they argue, because only then can they push for social change. 'It's only in office that black leaders can then begin to legislate,' Gillespie said.</p> <p>Perhaps an answer will emerge only if Obama wins the White House. That is a real possibility, undreamed of even two decades ago. But then America's racial politics are changing. Certainly few people 41 years ago, during the race riots in Newark, would have imagined that the first mayor to produce a memorial to them would be like Cory Booker: young, black, popular with whites and loved by the police. There are even whispers of much bigger things ahead in his political future. Even Manning had good words for the impact the mayor has had on a city that desperately needed help: 'I'll say this for Cory Booker. There isn't drugs being sold outside my house any more. I appreciate that.'</p>",

Simplicity, even austerity, is the current mode, which in personal relations translates as formality, at least this week. </p> <p><strong> Libra</strong></p> <p><strong>23 Sep-23 Oct</strong></p> <p>The discrimination you apply to shopping and interiors (let's forget the other 'd' word, dithering) might be brought to bear on your choice of associates, friends and sometime/maybe lovers. The lunar eclipse </p> <p>next Saturday dissolves outworn associations to make room for fresh blood - which you need, if only for the purpose of disputation! Who's in and who's out is your secret. Next weekend looks agreeably wild. </p> <p><strong>Scorpio</strong></p> <p><strong>24 Oct-21 Nov</strong></p> <p>Even if you're toasting your toes on a trendy beach, how you get to the top of your professional game (or stay there) is the question posed by August's twin eclipses. Solutions are probably self evident, and you would appear to have a squad of collegiate support, making the key factor swiftness. This week promises fresh information - then once Saturday's full Moon is gone, swoop into action.</p> <p><strong>Sagittarius</strong></p> <p><strong>22 Nov-21 Dec</strong></p> <p>Commanding week incoming - time to keep the wheels of industry turning prior to the autumn slowdown. Holiday makers can tick off everything on the must-see list, while eclipses in your travel zone suggest visits abroad have a long-term resonance. A waxing Moon hands you an intuitive edge - back your hunches.</p> <p><strong>Capricorn</strong></p> <p><strong>22 Dec-19 Jan</strong></p> <p>The Goat has a reputation for control freakery (no comment), but current stars emphasise your ability to make common cause, impress, and, ahem, show your tail feathers are no less dandy than anyone else's. Gilded hours ahead, perfect for launching your world domination blitz or for maximum schmooze. </p> <p><strong>Aquarius</strong></p> <p><strong>20 Jan-19 Feb</strong> </p> <p>You're almost clear of the sticky month of Leo, but first you must face next Saturday's Aquarian full Moon, which is likely to put you on the spot... or with any luck in the limelight. Dress to impress. As an eclipse is involved, so is change, especially for 6-13 Feb birthdays. If you're looking to escape the past, heal a wound or spin your reputation, this is your time.</p> <p><strong>Pisces</strong></p> <p><strong>20 Feb-20 Mar</strong></p> <p>The bad news is that with several planets ganging up against you, expect steely opposition to some of your propositions. On the positive side, it's the perfect time to engage in diplomacy and deal-making, given that you are the one with the radical ideas (no kidding). Cool formality is the way to play your hand - the same goes for doting daters. </p> <p><strong>Aries</strong></p> <p><strong>21 Mar-19 Apr</strong> </p> <p>True kindred spirits reveal themselves by their constancy. As August delivers two major eclipses - the second at the full Moon next Saturday - a degree of change in your friendship circle is to be expected. Watch and see who's left standing afterwards.

Call them destiny if you like (or the Saros 10 eclipse path if you prefer), but they spell the chance to re-orient your public persona into a more favourable position. It may be holiday season but keep focused. The playful, personal stuff is also in a favourable phase, though you may have to make old-school manners your calling card this week. </p> <p><strong>Gemini</strong></p> <p><strong>21 May-20 Jun</strong> </p> <p>You may be parked on a beach in blissful idleness, but your horoscope remains in a restless mood, there being little more than a month before an enforced go-slow.

Here's a week to spring your trap - even if you don't land your catch, you can move on.

  "<p>Round about the time that Britain sits down to enjoy a Sunday lunch this afternoon, 19-year-old Rebecca Adlington will be getting ready to jump into the pool in her first Olympic competition. With plenty of teenagers making their Olympic debuts this summer that may not sound like anything too special, but consider that before April of this year Adlington was a complete unknown outside the world of swimming anoraks and you have rather a different picture. </p> <p>Since the World Swimming Championships in Manchester four months ago, Adlington has becomes Britain's best hope for a gold medal in the pool. And no Briton has accomplished that since Adrian Moorhouse won in Seoul in the 100m breaststroke. Never mind gold, Britain's women haven't won an Olympic swimming medal at all since Sarah Hardcastle and June Croft won silver and bronze respectively in the 400m freestyle in Los Angeles, 1984. </p> <p>Adlington's swim in the Olympic trials in Sheffield smashed Hardcastle's British 800m freestyle record of 22 years, becoming the fastest time in the world this year. The win was no fluke, Adlington followed it up with gold at the World Championships a week later, knocking 12 seconds off her personal best and just missing out on a world record by a quarter of a second (although she nailed the European record). In July there was more, another personal best in the 400m, with a time of 4:02.08 at the National Championships. </p> <p>A freestyle specialist, today she goes into the 400m freestyle heats hoping to qualify for the final tomorrow morning, Beijing time. A jam-packed schedule will then see her compete for the 200m and 800m freestyle - she is ranked No 1 in the world in the latter - as well as the 4x200m relay this week. </p> <p>Since she's so good why hadn't anyone hard of her before? A silver in the European Championships in 2006 may have registered on some radars, but in truth Adlington has been struggling with illness since missing the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne over two years ago. Then glandular fever had struck her down, that dreaded disease so often the scourge of teenagers. Although she recovered, her body was then hit with fatigue syndrome, a problem that, she concedes, if not kept an eye on could strike again at any time. </p> <p>Her coach Bill Furniss has warned against high expectations, reminding the media that this is still Adlington's Olympic debut, and in truth she had not been expected to appear before London 2012. 'People tend to do better at their second Olympics than their first,' says Furniss. 'We are not talking about medals and places [with Rebecca], we are talking about doing the best performance you can and getting the reward from that. It is horrendously tough and you can be the best swimmer in the world and not make the final if you are not right on the day.' </p> <p>Despite Furniss's emphasis on an Olympic background to win medals, it is obvious that Adlington has other kinds of experience in her bag that will help her today. The old adage about disappointment preparing an athlete for greatness has, in a sense, already happened to Adlington, toughening her up for pressure in Beijing. Certainly taking on the world's best at the World Championships will have given her plenty of confidence should the sight of America's 'Female Phelps' Katie Hoff give her the shakes. Hoff is likely to be Adlington's fiercest opponent as she aims for seven Olympic medals in three of Adlington's disciplines. </p> <p>Indeed British swimming has plenty to grin about as the Olympic competition gets under way with three British women ranked in the world's top five this year. Alongside Adlington, Hannah Miley - also 19 - yesterday made the final of the 400m medley, and Jemma Lowe - just 18 years old - made the semi-final of the 100m butterfly. </p> <p>Curiously none of these swimmers was available for interview in the midweek press conference - a move that some may find brings back memories of the media blackout ahead of the Athens Olympics, when former National Performance Director Bill Sweetenham asked that swimmers be left to concentrate on preparation. Sweetenham stepped down last year, citing personal reasons, after seven years in the job, but if Britain's women bring home the bacon this week he may feel he has a right to claim a part in that. </p> <p>Governing body politics aside, that won't be something that Adlington - a sensible Mansfield girl - will worry about. Other than owning a pair of Christian Louboutin stiletto shoes with the trademark red lacquer undersoles - her prized possession - she is as down to earth as any, citing Ricky Gervais and Peter Kay as her famous would-like-to-meet's. Before heading out to Beijing her parents bought her a customised licence plate for her rather battered little Corsa: 'R800 GBR', it reads. Should everything go Adlington's way, she may just want to get that changed to 'GOLD', and invest in a new car to boot.</p>",
  "<p>It is debatable whether the most highly stressed part of Felipe Massa's Ferrari last Sunday was the connecting rod that failed or the Brazilian rendered helpless in the driving seat when a commanding victory in Hungary was denied with three of the 70 laps remaining. Massa had surprised everyone, not least the McLaren drivers on the front row, when he shot past Heikki Kovalainen at the start and then boldly sat it out with Lewis Hamilton through the first corner to take a lead he would not lose until that connecting rod let go without warning.</p> <p>When you consider the war going on inside a Formula One engine, the surprise is that such failures do not occur more often. There are more than 900 moving parts, some of which operate within their confined area at 230mph. Internal surfaces reach 300C and the connecting rods are responsible for plunging and thrusting each of eight pistons through 38,000 strokes every minute. Massa's curtailed race lasted for 94 minutes and each of those 3.6 million strokes would have involved acceleration of 8,500G.</p> <p>In simple terms, if a piston was allowed to shoot out of the cylinder, the best estimate is that it would travel a mile into the air. Yet all of that inherent violence is somehow contained within a V8 engine that must last for not one, but two races without being touched internally. Such is the extraordinary reliability that is now accepted as the norm within F1, it is no consolation for Massa to know that his engine was coming to the end of its two-race cycle and that the connecting rod broke because of, to quote Ferrari, 'a one-off quality problem'. </p> <p>Ferrari have an impeccable record of reliability - Michael Schumacher once ran for more than 50 consecutive races without a mechanical failure - and the Italian team will have been just as distraught as their driver, particularly when Massa's fourth win of the season would have put him back at the top of the championship. There was only small comfort to be had by a puncture preventing Hamilton from taking the lead since the Englishman recovered to finish fifth and retain his position at the head of the points table. Even worse for Ferrari was the increasingly uncomfortable fact that, yet again, Kimi Raikkonen was not in a position to back up his stricken team-mate, whereas Kovalainen was poised to step forward and inherit his first F1 victory. </p> <p>The obvious good fortune that fell to the Finn should be offset against the bad luck that has characterised his season and denied him a place among the championship contenders. A 24-point deficit to Hamilton may seem insurmountable with seven races remaining, but it is worth remembering that this time last year Raikkonen was 20 points behind the seemingly unassailable McLaren driver and yet Raikkonen went on to become world champion in the final race.</p> <p>Hamilton is unlikely to lose much sleep over a challenge from a team-mate with whom he works extremely well, but it would be a mistake to assume that Kovalainen is ready to act as a rear-gunner. Before last Sunday's race, Ron Dennis reiterated that a policy of equal opportunities continued within his McLaren team, despite Fernando Alonso's bitter and rather sad assertion to the contrary after his occasional humiliation at the hands of Hamilton last year.</p> <p>Now that he has the important psychological boost of that first win, Kovalainen will wish to prove that he has been just as fast as Hamilton, certainly during qualifying if not all of the races, but circumstances beyond his control have compromised his performances. When the teams meet again in Valencia on 24 August, Hamilton may find he has more in-house competition than he once bargained for. The same feeling of mild apprehension might have begun to gnaw at Jarno Trulli's more fragile self-confidence. Timo Glock produced the surprise of the weekend by not only recovering from a bruising encounter with the pit wall when the rear suspension of his Toyota failed in Germany on 20 July, but also by driving with a new lease of life from the moment practice opened in Hungary. Trulli, until now the principal points scorer for Toyota, was left standing as the German, having dispatched Robert Kubica and BMW at the first corner, continued to lap consistently quickly and finished 11 seconds behind Kovalainen.</p> <p>The 26-year-old's first visit to the podium will have lifted his confidence just as surely as the surge of inspiration felt by the man on the top step of the podium. Even if there may be problems with their drivers racing each other to the detriment of the championship, McLaren will welcome such strength in numbers. Ferrari failed in terms of scoring points, but Massa's untouchable and faultless performance proved once again in this exceptional season that the momentum is shifting continually. The teams are supposed to be having a short break but, for Massa and Kovalainen, the new venue on the streets of Valencia cannot come quickly enough.</p>",
  "<p>Rangers managed to avoid the result their fans had dreaded, but it owed as much to the incompetence of an opponent as their own merit. The unconvincing attempt to score from the penalty spot by the Falkirk striker Michael Higdon proved, predictably, to be the prelude to the goal from Andrius Velicka that brought the troubled Ibrox side the points. </p> <p>As opening days go, it is unlikely to find a place in the annals of either club, but, for Rangers, it was at least a relief from their recent torment. None of those wearing the royal blue favours in the stands, however, would have left convinced that their problems were over. </p> <p>For long periods of the match, it was clear that the anxieties that had accompanied Rangers on the short trip from Glasgow were not confined to the supporters' buses. The team coach seemed to have carried a few of its own. Considering the ordeal of the previous 10 days, in which their calamitous matches against FBK Kaunas in the Champions League were punctuated by the 4-0 mauling from Liverpool at Ibrox, it was hardly surprising that the self-belief of Walter Smith's players should be fragile almost to the point of fragmentation. </p> <p>The manager recognised the need to make alterations in personnel and formation, shelving his 4-5-1 for a 4-4-2, with Kris Boyd restored to attack beside Velicka in the absence of the injured Kenny Miller. That the partnership should complete the entire first half with only one scoring attempt between them was an indicator of the overall flatness of the visitors. </p> <p>It should be said, however, that Boyd had been denied what appeared a golden opportunity by a terrific tackle by Darren Barr, the young Falkirk captain timing the challenge perfectly as the Rangers striker, having taken a precise through-pass from Velicka in his stride, was on the point of shooting with only goalkeeper Robert Olejnik to beat. </p> <p>Boyd's effort from a corner kick on the left - the ball had been glanced on into his feet - was a close-range shot that was blocked on the line. These were isolated scares for the home side, whose retaliation was often composed and attractive, but lacked the edge that would cause their visitors genuine alarm. Higdon, for example, snatched carelessly at a volley after Scott Arfield had played the pass across the goal area. The Falkirk striker seemed still to be claiming the penalty for an earlier push by the Rangers defender Kirk Broadfoot. </p> <p>That moment would merely emphasise the irony of what would occur later, when the home side were awarded a penalty for Steven Whittaker's trip on the impressive Kevin McBride. Higdon's timing and co-ordination seemed to have been left in the dressing room and the tall striker's bad day was capped by a poor attempt at conversion, his side-footed attempt to send the ball to the left of Allan McGregor so weakly struck and so injudiciously placed that the Rangers goalkeeper would have been surprised at how easy the save was. Strangely, Higdon managed to remain on the field for another 30 minutes before being replaced by Dayne Robertson. By then, however, Rangers had scored the goal that would secure victory on what had been one of their rare skirmishes in the vicinity of the home goal.</p> <p>The visitors had been curiously reticent for most of the second half and perhaps it was their sudden spurt forward that wrong-footed the Falkirk defenders. Christian Dailly played the ball forward to Boyd, who, with his back to the goal on the edge of the area, headed laterally to Kyle Lafferty. The big Irishman carried it out to the right and, his low cut-back having eluded the challenging Olejnik, Velicka was presented with a tap-in from three yards. </p> <p>Dailly would make another vital contribution with his challenge on the slow-moving Higdon that may have prevented the striker from atoning for his penalty miss, but Falkirk's general failure to bring incisiveness to their neat passing game is a flaw that will have to be rectified if they are to fulfil their ambition of finishing in the top six of the league.</p>",
  "<p>As the brutal central California sun rose over the city of Stockton, Cesar Dias fuelled up his brightly painted tour bus and waited for the hordes to arrive.</p> <p>'We get 20 or 30 people every Saturday by 10.30,' says Dias. 'By the end of the day we will have maybe 60 or 70. On a busy day I take the bus out three times.'</p> <p>His guided tours are very different from the usual trips around the homes of Hollywood stars. Dias is a real estate broker and his tour buses ferry would-be house buyers, and the occasional gawker, around the scores of foreclosed properties dotted all over town: 'The number of foreclosures around here has made us into an attraction.'</p> <p>Stockton has become known as Foreclosure Town, USA. With one in 25 houses in foreclosure, there are more properties with mortgages in default here than anywhere else in the country. And it is not as if there isn't some stiff competition for Stockton's dubious accolade in other corners of California, and indeed the rest of America.</p> <p>In the past 12 months, the US housing crisis has spawned the credit crunch, which in turn has placed the entire economy in a stranglehold as the fear of sustained recession hangs over the nation.</p> <p>But in recent weeks the ferocity of the downturn has been gathering pace in California, with the strain of economic unrest being felt at every level of society - all the way up to Arnold Schwarzenegger in the state governor's mansion.</p> <p>'This whole state is in a terrible mess financially,' Dias concedes as he prepares to board his Repo Home Tours bus.</p> <p>The stellar increase in house prices was inflated first, fastest and furthest in California. So it is not surprising, now that the bubble has burst and the market is in freefall, that places like Stockton are suffering more than most.</p> <p>But the city is far more significant in the big picture of California's troubled economy than many realise.</p> <p>The problems facing this part-old, part-new city are being duplicated all over the state, causing an economic ripple effect that could push America's biggest economy to the brink of collapse.</p> <p>Indeed, a walk around this once prosperous commuter town 130km north of San Francisco is a frightening reminder that social destruction on a grand scale can happen in the blink of an eye, even in suburban California.</p> <p>You can tell which are the houses in foreclosure. The paint on the white picket fences is peeling, the lawns are turning brown and the water in backyard swimming pools has become a stinking green soup of algae and mosquito larvae.</p> <p>On one street the tour bus passes, all of the five houses are in foreclosure. Two of them are boarded up; one is missing its front door. A couple of stray dogs wander about in a semi-furnished living room, probably abandoned by owners forced to flee when the sheriff came calling with a notice to vacate.</p> <p>In other empty dwellings, plates of food are left to putrefy on dining tables, another sign that one evening not too long ago, a perfectly ordinary family had to leave.</p> <p>The economic problems of this now collapsing town cannot be laid entirely at the door of unscrupulous mortgage lenders or irresponsible borrowers who fed at the trough of rising house prices for too long. The construction industry, one of the biggest providers of employment and taxes to the state of California, must share the blame.</p> <p>Stockton was a gold-rush city that sprang up in the mid-19th century. In the post-war years it became popular with commuters who could not afford pricier San Francisco Bay.</p> <p>Then, about six years ago, a new gold rush gripped the town as developers snapped up cheap land on the outskirts and in shadier neighbourhoods downtown. The housing boom was in full swing, providing jobs and a healthy supply of new homes to keep voracious buyers satisfied.</p> <p>But this was no ordinary gold rush; it was alchemy, with the developers turning piles of concrete, glass and steel into gold as if by magic.</p> <p>This boom was great for state finances as taxes levied on the new buildings and on the tens of thousands of construction workers arriving in the state flooded in. But Stockton's newfound prosperity was just a flash in the pan. All too quickly the city became vastly overdeveloped, with so many empty houses and blocks of flats that the place started to feel like a ghost town.</p> <p>The level of overdevelopment is evident in Stockton's run-down marina area. Here, the Sheraton Hotel - the centrepiece of a regenerated waterfront quarter - is in receivership and the 'luxury condominiums' that were supposed to sell for $750,000 (\u00a3375,000) apiece are unfinished.</p> <p>The scale of foreclosure in Stockton is mirrored in the latest state housing statistics. Almost $1.3 trillion of homeowner equity has been lost in California since home prices peaked in December 2005. It is predicted that house price discounts of as much as 50 per cent will extend into 2010.</p> <p>California led the US in default notices and bank seizures for the 18th straight month in June, and had seven of the 10 metropolitan areas with the highest foreclosure rates, according to RealtyTrac, an internet housing data firm. </p> <p>Lenders started foreclosure proceedings on a record number of California homeowners last quarter, the result of declining home values and the rampant spoilage of especially risky home loans made in late 2005 and 2006. </p> <p>Mortgage providers recorded 121,341 notices of default during the April-to-June period, a rise of 6.6 per cent from 113,809 in the first quarter, and up 124.9 per cent from 53,943 in the second quarter of 2007, according to DataQuick Information Systems.</p> <p>California homeowners going into default on their primary mortgages were on average five months behind on their payments, while those in trouble on their second mortgages were about eight months overdue. Last quarter's default numbers were a record in almost all of California's 58 counties. </p> <p>Of the homeowners in default, only an estimated 22 per cent emerge from the foreclosure process by bringing their payments up to date, refinancing, or selling the home and paying off what they owe. A year ago it was about 52 per cent. Foreclosure sales now account for 40 per cent of all California home sales activity in the most recent three-month period. A year ago it was 5.4 per cent. </p> <p>So big was the glut of newly built property in California that it soon became evident that there were not enough people with the funds to buy. So the sub-prime mortgage industry was created in California, with all kinds of home loan products designed to attract people who did not qualify for an ordinary mortgage.</p> <p>Adjustable-rate mortgages - ARMs - became very popular, as did so-called 'Alt-A' loans - ones that do not require the borrower to produce any documentation to support his or her application.</p> <p>This type of mortgage is also known as a 'liar loan'. The best catch-all term for these dodgy mortgage products, though, is Ninja Loan - short for No Identity, No Job, no Assets. California-based IndyMac bank was one of America's leading providers of Alt-A 'liar loans'. It is not surprising, then, that it collapsed last month - the third-biggest banking failure in American history.</p> <p>IndyMac was founded in 1985 as an offshoot of Countrywide Financial - one of the biggest sub-prime mortgage firms in America, which was itself almost forced to the wall by the housing market collapse and was only saved by a $4bn buyout from Bank of America.</p> <p>Countrywide is another Californian institution that helped to create the rampant sub-prime industry that has wreaked havoc in credit markets and beyond all over the world. David Loeb and Angelo Mozilo, the bank's founders, have been pilloried in America for creating a virtual black hole of debt and one of the biggest economic nightmares of the past 80 years. But nobody was complaining when Countrywide was worth $24bn.</p> <p>California - or at least its biggest cities, Los Angeles and San Diego - have also been particularly hard hit by the massive increase in the price of oil and, consequently, the price of petrol.</p> <p>The state's towns and cities are built around the automobile. With the price of petrol more than doubling in the past year, it is no wonder that cash-strapped Californians are being pushed into bankruptcy at an alarming and historic rate.</p> <p>'In southern California everybody drives everywhere - you have to,' says David Wyss, chief economist at Standard &amp; Poor's, the New York-based credit rating agency, who adds that he is 'concerned' about the state's economic stress. 'There is a confluence of negative factors,' he goes on. 'The housing market and the price of fuel are the most significant ones.' </p> <p>The state legislature is having trouble completing a budget this year because a massive decrease in taxes - due to so many losing their homes and jobs - and a huge increase in spending have led to a massive $15bn shortfall.</p> <p>The crisis has escalated in recent weeks, with governor Schwarzenegger putting more than 200,000 state employees on the minimum wage, firing 22,000 temporary workers and threatening to add a penny to the rate of sales tax until the budget is passed. 'We are in this position for two reasons,' says Aaron McLear, Schwarzenegger's spokesman. 'One, we have a flawed budget system but the main problem is that our expenditure far exceeds our income.'</p> <p>The Californian budget process is so complex and causes such a headache every year that all banks in the state provide interest-free loans to all state employees because they know that there will always be several months in the year when state employee pay is suspended or reduced pending budget finalisation. 'It is totally ridiculous,' McLear adds.</p> <p>Despite all this negativity, it is unlikely that the Californian economy will fail completely, however. Comprising about 10 per cent of entire American output, California is too big and too complex to suffer an all-out collapse. </p> <p>But the state's credit rating has been cut and could come under more pressure if a budget is not passed and if foreclosures, job losses and bankruptcies continue to suck the life out of state finances.</p> <p>'The California state treasury is threatening to sue us if we don't raise their credit rating but in the meantime they can't even get a budget signed. It's a mess,' says Wyss. </p> <p>Schwarzenegger is doing everything he can to bring the budget crisis to a head. He is refusing to sign any more bills into law until the budget is completed. 'With a cash crisis looming and some payments from the state delayed already, the late budget takes on even a greater urgency,' the governor says. </p> <p>'Until the legislature passes a budget that I can sign, I will not sign any bills that reach my desk. That means that some good bills will fail, yes.'</p> <p>This kind of fiscal nightmare is nothing new in California. 'We have only had four budgets passed on time in the past 20 years,' McLear says. It has been eight weeks since the legislature missed its deadline to sign the new state budget, and if it does not act in the next couple of weeks the state will be forced to take out high-interest loans.</p> <p>California is not alone. Wyss says that America's troubled states are roughly divided into three categories: 'bubble states' like California, Arizona, Nevada and Florida that are suffering declining tax revenue because of the housing crisis; auto industry states such as Michigan and Ohio that are suffering revenue declines because of an exodus of unemployed former factory workers; and 'banker states' such as New York, California again and Illinois, suffering big drops in tax revenue because of the collapse in financial services.</p> <p>'All of these states will face terrible problems, just like California is facing today,' Wyss says, adding that states such as Texas, benefiting from the massive increase in the price of oil, and the farming states of the Midwest are doing well because of steep increases in food prices, and will more than likely be spared any pain. 'This is a very economically divided country today,' he adds.</p> <p>And not everyone, even in California, is suffering. Since he started his 'foreclosure tours' Dias's business has been enjoying a renaissance. 'We are getting bidding wars for a lot of properties in foreclosure,' he says, giving an indication that excess housing stock is being mopped up and the market bottom is not too far off. 'And we have two TV companies that want to make a show about us,' Dias adds. </p> <p>But the chances of such a gloomy programme attracting a regular audience do not seem great. People watch TV to escape everyday worries. Foreclosure, for many Americans, remains a harsh reality that cannot be avoided.</p>",
  "<p>Beijing's lavish Olympics may fixate viewers around the world for the next fortnight, but analysts say the spectacle will have little lasting impact on China's vast economy.</p> <p>China has splashed out an extraordinary $40bn on readying itself for the games - more than all previous Olympics combined, according to Mark Williams of Capital Economics. Yet spread over six years, that has increased GDP by just 0.2 per cent - a modest boost when set against the rampant economic growth of 10 per cent a year China has clocked up over the past decade.</p> <p>'For all the excitement, the Games will have next to no direct economic impact,' Williams said. He added that Beijing is home to a smaller proportion of the country's population than any of the other host cities since 1972. 'Olympic spending in and around Beijing pales against investment spending nationally.'</p> <p>Mandatory factory shutdowns in recent weeks to try to bring smog under control may have a dampening effect on industrial output, and Williams points out that the area covered by the restrictions is larger than France, Germany, Italy and the UK combined. But firms had early warning, allowing them to boost production in the run-up to the Games.</p>",
  "<p>I saw Francis Bacon once in passing 30 years ago, on the gilt and velvet staircase at the Royal Opera House. Even if I hadn't known who he was - the most celebrated painter of his time, all the more famous for the diabolical whiff of sulphur exuded by his alcoholic binges, his homosexual promiscuity and his voluptuous taste for pain - I would have found him unforgettable. </p> <p>His face was a painting. Boot polish had been applied to his teased hair, with a quizzical wisp of a fringe fixed over his forehead; a thick application of make-up gave his cheeks a feverish heat. His eyes kept watch from inside asymmetrical craters, mementoes of drunken tumbles or of beatings administered by the East End bruisers with whom he consorted. His smile showed off teeth scoured with Vim, and inside his oddly circular mouth his tongue darted as if it were a lizard jabbing at its prey. He looked eruptive, like the popes who scream on their thrones in his early paintings. </p> <p>As the novelist Paul Bowles wrote, Bacon's head always seemed liable 'to burst from internal pressures'. Or perhaps that head was likely to liquefy, melted like wax by some combustible fantasy within. I could imagine a puddle of boot polish, mascara, rouge and granulated ammonia on the plush Covent Garden carpet.</p> <p>After a few more years of furious creativity by day and self-destructive indulgence by night, Bacon died of a heart attack in 1992 in Madrid. As his centenary approaches, oligarchs and arms dealers compete for possession of paintings in which feral, rutting men and mutant women reel through life in a mood of what Bacon thought of as tragic gaiety, exhilarated by their lack of hope: last May, Roman Abramovich broke the record for contemporary art auctions by spending $86 million on Triptych, 1976</p> <p>A few surviving acolytes and cronies - veterans of stupefied afternoons in Soho clubs, resilient victims of Bacon's vitriolic temper - cling to their memories of revelling with him, though as time goes on it becomes harder to separate the man from the mythic figure he has become. The French critic Michel Leiris likened Bacon to a pantheon of legendary heroes: Orestes guiltily pursued by the furies, Hamlet grappling with a censorious ghost, Don Juan driven by sexual demons. </p> <p>Hoping to demythologise him, I talked to two fellow artists he encouraged, Peter Beard and Michael Clark; to his biographer Michael Peppiatt, who was a 19-year-old student when they first met in 1963; and to the Irish photographer John Minihan, who, after snapping Bacon in 1971 outside a magistrate's court where he was facing a trumped-up drugs charge, became obsessed with documenting his irregular existence. What I found was that even those who knew Bacon well were unsure who or what he was: a human being or a self-fashioned artefact? A bilious ogre or a suffering god?</p> <p>As Peppiatt recalled: 'Francis used to say, \"I'm the most artificial person you'll ever meet.\" He followed the example of an old whore in Paris, who said to him, \"Je me fais jeune\" - I make myself young.' 'He did a lot of work on himself,' Clark agreed, hinting that Bacon's jowls had been tidied away by cosmetic surgery. Peppiatt likened him to a devil, an irresistible tempter, and Clark described him as a phantom, a noctambulant wanderer noiselessly circulating on cr\u00eape-soled shoes. 'I'd say he was a sacred monster,' smiled Minihan. 'He was Prometheus,' said Beard, 'with the eagle picking at his liver every day. He had a mantra that he got from Nietzsche. He was always repeating it: \"Since everything's so meaningless, we might as well be extraordinary.\"'</p> <p>One thing they don't deny is Bacon's centrality to their lives. 'I had my best times with Fran,' Beard told me. 'The drunker he got, the more sense he made.' 'That was a life-determining encounter for me,' said Peppiatt about buttonholing Bacon in a Soho pub to interview him for a Cambridge student journal. 'Francis immediately became essential to you, like an addiction. It was so exciting, so exalted to be with him.' </p> <p>'I love talking about him,' Minihan burbled, before leading me off on a nostalgic tour of Bacon's South Kensington haunts - the mews studio where he painted in a swamp of composted squalor, the cornershop where he bought his smoked salmon, the automated booth in the tube station where he took the grimacing photographs he used for his self-portraits, the bus stop where he was patiently standing when Minihan saw him for the last time.</p> <p>In all these relationships, adoration was mixed with anxiety, even dread. Valerie Beston, the Marlborough Gallery employee who looked after Bacon's chaotic business affairs, once said to Peppiatt, 'I can't think of a worse fate than being loved by Francis.' An early partner, Peter Lacy, fantasised about keeping Bacon chained to the wall and buggering him with a gang of accomplices; when they split up, Lacy sullenly drank himself to death in Tangier. </p> <p>Bacon's East End boyfriend George Dyer, a petty crook whose intimates included the Kray twins, died in 1971 of an overdose of sleeping pills in a Paris hotel two days before the opening of Bacon's retrospective show at the Grand Palais: the doomed relationship is the subject of John Maybury's 1998 film Love is the Devil, with Daniel Craig as the befuddled Dyer and Derek Jacobi as an evilly epicene Bacon. Clearly, Bacon was dangerous to know.</p> <p>For both Peppiatt and Clark, to enter the dives he frequented was like descending into an underworld, a realm of arduous tests and trials where young lads were despoiled of their innocence. Or perhaps it was a dizzier, more vertical rite, climbing into a rarified atmosphere of bohemian decadence. </p> <p>Clark remembered the staircase that led up to the studio in Reece Mews, with a rope to clutch instead of a banister. 'It was as steep as a ladder, and so narrow that his paintings had to be squeezed out with not an inch to spare, so the edges always got scuffed. He'd leave the downstairs door open for me. I'd haul myself up with one hand on the rope, preparing for some great experience when I got to the top.' </p> <p>The initiation could be hazardous. Peppiatt was at first rebuffed by Bacon's pet photographer John Deakin, who flapped his wrist and - using the feminine pronouns that were obligatory for Bacon's camp courtiers - said 'Oh no dear, she's become so famous she wouldn't deign to meet a student!' In 1977 Muriel Belcher, the dragon-like proprietor of the Colony Room in Soho, told Clark he was a 'cheeky cunt' when he gatecrashed her drinking club; another of Bacon's witchy guardians said, 'You're too young and pretty, you'll need to get your face bashed in a bit before my daughter takes an interest in you'. </p> <p>'I was a bit na\u00efve,' Clark primly added. 'Valerie arranged for me to make a portrait of Francis, but I wasn't a lackey - maybe that's why he trusted me.'</p> <p>'Yes, I was playing with fire,' Peppiatt admitted. 'There was always some foreboding when I went to meet him, I knew I'd be X-rayed down to the bone. You remember in that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oixAAcBTstE&amp;feature=related\">South Bank Show</a> when he keeps on pouring out red wine and says to Melvyn Bragg \"Are you real?\". You can feel Bragg flinching off-camera. Francis probed you like that, but it was more fun than studying for my Cambridge exams. I suppose he was attracted to me: he liked the challenge of a strapping young heterosexual. But I felt protected by him, never exploited. With George Dyer, it was trickier. He enjoyed the idea of luring me out of my respectable background into something criminal.' </p> <p>Peppiatt brilliantly mimicked Dyer's adenoidal, glottal-stopped cockney grunt: '\"Fuckin' college boys, ain't got the guts for a proper job.\" He dared me to turn up at some midnight rendezvous to rob a house or something. I was there on the dot, it was George who didn't keep the date! Francis had a subtler way of corrupting people. He loved to be ripped off, he'd leave bundles of money lying round to see if the rough trade he picked up took the bait - and they always did. He wanted to prove people to be rotten, himself included. \"Rotten to the core,\" he'd say about himself, and he said it with pleasure and a kind of pride.'</p> <p>Knowing Bacon enabled Peppiatt to walk on the wild side, trifling with illegality; for Clark - a fey, slightly haunted character, who told me in a paranoid whisper that he was 'breaking silence for the first time after 30 years' by discussing Bacon - the experience was an induction into mysteries that resembled the arcane ceremonies of a religious cult. 'He gave me access to everywhere in the studio. There'd be underwear strung up to dry in the bathroom, and frying pans full of pigment in the kitchen. For me, it was like those labs where the alchemists conducted their experiments - a cabbalistic place. There was a charm on the door, a secret symbol to warn that you were entering somewhere hallowed. He had a mirror that was smashed when someone threw an ashtray at it; it was pitted all over, and the silver backing had corroded. It was a black mirror, like seers use. It didn't reflect reality, it showed you visions. You can say it's all hocus-pocus, but what Francis did was esoteric: he was playing with very powerful, violent forces when he made those images.'</p> <p>Peppiatt too acknowledges that he was 'spellbound' during his time with Bacon. Hero-worship usually compensates for some psychological need in the eager worshipper, and in Peppiatt's case, as he said, 'Francis was a father-substitute. I didn't get on well with my actual father, and here was this charming, devious replacement. In return he told me about his problems with his own father. He hated him, yet felt sexually attracted to him. And Eddie Bacon so despised this effeminate son that he got the stablehands on their horse-breeding farm in Ireland to flog Francis to toughen him up! Trust Francis to combine pleasure with pain by having affairs with the grooms who were told to whip him.' </p> <p>The lurid Oedipal scenario may explain one of Beard's reminiscences. 'Fran loved his Shakespeare, and he was always reciting that song from The Tempest, \"Full fathom five thy father lies, / Of his bones are coral made\".' It sounds like a joyfully lyrical revenge, on behalf of wishfully patricidal boys. Yet when Peppiatt's father died, Bacon was tenderly solicitous. 'He took me out to dinner to console me, and we ended up at Annabel's having a second supper at one in the morning. \"Why don't you dance?\" he said, but I told him I didn't feel like it. So he went over and told a girl I'd had an eye on that I was too shy to ask her to dance. He pimped for me! When we got on to the dance floor, I looked around and he'd gone - he'd left me to enjoy myself. That was so healing: it reintroduced me to the fun of life.'</p> <p>While Bacon supplied Peppiatt with an alternative father, to the homesick Minihan he represented a lost fatherland. 'I was born in Dublin, like Francis, though his family was grand and mine didn't have a pot to piss in. My mother went off to England and gave me to her sister to be reared. Francis was sent away by his father when he was 16; a friend of the family took him to Berlin, so he completed his education in the gay bars and cabarets that Auden and Isherwood went to. I was even younger when I escaped. I left school at 11, came to London and got a job as an office boy in Fleet Street. You could say I finished school at El Vino! </p> <p>'It wasn't fashionable to be Irish in London in the 1970s, as the IRA were blowing the place up, but I always wanted to photograph my own people; I was working for the Evening Standard in the Seventies and I volunteered to go to the magistrate's court because they told me some Irish painter was up on a cannabis charge. That's all I knew about him. He let me take his photograph, and after they acquitted him - it was Dyer who planted the drugs and tipped off the police after some tiff they'd had - we walked off to Soho together. He was very gracious and kind, that was one of his Irish qualities.'</p> <p>Bacon's grace and hospitable generosity are evident in Minihan's photographs of him squiring William S Burroughs around town: upstaged for once in his life, he fusses over his frail, bewildered companion. Minihan's photographs also capture a sociable exhibitionism that counteracts tales about Bacon's maniacal rages and his morbid gloom. </p> <p>Michael Clark's portraits of Bacon emphasise the sad preoccupation of his sagging face, with eyes deep in concussed hollows grimly contemplating mortality; Minihan's Bacon, by contrast, looks quite different: dapper, dandified, irrepressibly larky. In one photograph, he preens in a PVC mac, no doubt relishing the snug feel of the female panties and fishnet stockings that he customarily wore as undergarments. 'Ah yes,' said Minihan, 'that's Francis throwing me some shapes, as we say in Ireland. He loved clothes, and so did I. He liked to pose and swagger when he had something fancy to show off, just like Oscar Wilde with his green carnation.'</p> <p>Perhaps there was more to this fashionable flaunting than Minihan suspected. 'His clothes were always so tight,' Peppiatt remembered. 'Pegged trousers, leather jackets with epaulettes, those belted macs - he liked the sense of constriction, as if he was in bondage. And he wore a necklace that was so tight it often seemed to be choking him.' </p> <p>Clark also recalled the choker, and wondered whether it had anything to do with the self-asphyxiating games of those who seek the perfect orgasm. In Bacon's paintings, a live, captive being often writhes in a steel cage; he created the same agonised entrapment for himself when he got dressed. The fetishistic gear also disciplined him. His afternoons and nights may have been devoted to the sloppy satisfaction of desire, but his mornings in the studio were a triumph of the strict, self-punishing will. Peter Beard noticed Bacon's weakness for uniforms made from animal skins and polished to a high shine, and drew the obvious conclusion: 'Fran sure as hell loved the Third Reich!' Bacon once gave a figure he painted a swastika armband; he disingenuously claimed that he liked the crooked shape and had no interest in what it signified.</p> <p>Minihan, chatting to Bacon about home, enrolled him in his own nostalgic psychodrama. 'My great ambition was to introduce Francis to Samuel Beckett, so I could photograph the meeting of two great Irish exiles. But Beckett was a recluse, and eluded me for years. And Francis wasn't keen, he said he couldn't see what the two of them had in common: he was nervous of meeting someone whose view of things was even bleaker than his own. I suppose it's true that he'd listen to me rattle on about Ireland, without contributing much himself. Most of what he said about it was dismissive. In 1977 I showed him some photographs of a wake that lasted two days and three nights in a village in the west of Ireland. I was so proud of this work: it was a family of Beckett characters, and the whole thing demonstrated, like Bacon's paintings, that death is the only reality. But Francis screeched \"Aaargh!\" and looked away. He didn't like the photographs, but wouldn't give a reason. He was consumed by himself, in his own world.'</p> <p>Like all who knew Bacon, Minihan had come up against a barrier, concealed by his boozy conviviality. Peppiatt's biography is subtitled Anatomy of an Enigma. When I asked Peppiatt what the enigma was, he immediately replied, 'His secretiveness. He had an almost magical gift for slipping away, for suddenly becoming someone else. And if you got too close, he warned you off by turning nasty.' </p> <p>The pub crawls, the sessions in casinos, even the bouts of sadomasochistic sex were all a diversion and an evasion. Bacon was only himself when he was alone in his studio, accompanied by the private incubi he painted. Even if he was painting a friend or a lover, he worked from photographs and debarred the living model: his solitude could not be shared, and the secrets of the image-making that contorted and even crucified reality were never imparted. </p> <p>'No one was allowed to see him at work,' Peter Beard remembered. 'The process had to remain out of sight. Once when he was drunk he spilled a bit too much. He said he added texture by sweeping up the mess on the studio floor and blowing it on to the wet painting: it was a kind of blow job! Then he got annoyed with me, because he regretted telling me.' </p> <p>Michael Clark saw the shutters drop when, invited to look at a new painting, he noticed a patch of pastel and asked Bacon how he had fixed it. 'There was a pause, then he said \"By the usual method\". He wasn't about to give away a technical tip; I realised I'd gone too far.'</p> <p>Confronted by this disappearing act, Bacon's friends were free to see him as whoever they wanted him to be, or as an ideal projection of themselves. This, I found, had happened to Bacon in the befogged memory of Peter Beard. 'My mind is fucked,' bawled Beard when I arrived to talk to him in Cassis, the resort near Marseille where he lives in a seaside villa. 'It's my attention deficit disorder - and the drink! Hey, that reminds me, can I get a kir? Then I can claim I was drunk during the interview. You gotta try one too, it's the local specialty.' </p> <p>While waiting for his solicitous young wife to bring the sweet blackcurrant cocktail, he ripped open a can of beer, chomped on a steak sandwich known as an Al Capone, and treated me to a hallucinatory anecdote about leafing through a book of Bacon reproductions while on an LSD trip in New York during the 1960s. </p> <p>'I'd recommend it,' he said. 'When you're full of the magic mushroom, you can see all those clouds of gaseous, tumultuous air that Fran painted.' Had I come to the south of France, I wondered, to talk about Bacon, or to meet Bacon's staggering reincarnation?</p> <p>Beard, now 70, inherited a fortune from a clan of American railway entrepreneurs; he spent his youth cavorting with supermodels and rock bands, and possesses the eroded remains of a handsome profile that Bacon often painted. When not lolling beside the Mediterranean, he lives on a property in East Africa, fondly named Hog Ranch. His Kenyan connections make him a Hemingwayesque character, boisterously virile - although, unlike Hemingway stalking big game, his obsession is protecting imperilled species rather than gunning them down. </p> <p>As a photographer, Beard has documented the slaughter of elephants and rhinos, which he sees as rehearsals for our human fate. 'Yeah, mankind is doomed,' growled Beard. 'I often talked to Fran about population dynamics, about how we were going the way of the elephants.' I wasn't sure about that meeting of minds: Bacon certainly thought that men were beasts, but he hardly shared Beard's ecological conscience.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Beard considers Bacon - whose mother and sisters moved to South Africa and Rhodesia after his father's death, and who went on a photographic safari to Kruger Park in the early 1950s - to be an honorary African. 'He was always planning to come stay on the ranch in Nairobi. He never made it, but the realities in his paintings are primitive, primordial, so to me they evoke Africa. All that bleeding meat, and the dry grass: he's the greatest painter of grass, and it's African grass, not a wet English lawn. </p> <p>'He was really into my dead elephants, and we had plans to collaborate on some sculptures. He was gonna mould the corpses and twist them over these immaculate chrome rails - he liked chrome because it reminded him of the car JFK was riding in when he was shot in Dallas - but there was a problem with the gallery in New York, some crap about keeping Brits out, and the dealer cancelled the show.'</p> <p>Beard's own work pays homage to Bacon's carnivorous art. On the roof of his Mediterranean villa samples of elephant blood coagulated in the sun, waiting to be smeared on photographic collages that include snapshots of Bacon, transcriptions of his talk, and excerpts from Beard's African diaries, speckled by vulture shit. Images, as in Bacon's paintings, emerge from an abattoir, and paint - which Bacon once likened to the slimy track of a snail - is one of the fluids that spurt from a live, dying body. According to Beard, a thug Bacon once picked up in Monte Carlo stumbled into an unfinished painting in the middle of the night on the way to the bathroom. 'He decided he wanted to add something to it, so he whipped out his prick and jerked off on the canvas. You can still see the jism dripping down it. Fran didn't mind sharing the credit!'</p> <p>A tough guy himself, Beard attributes the same machismo to Bacon. 'I hate the way Derek Jacobi minces about in that movie. I never saw one homosexual bone in Fran's body!' (At the very least, this counts as an original view.) </p> <p>'He was strength on strength,' bellowed Beard. 'He was the Rock of Gibraltar, the best of British. Hell, he wasn't camp, the guy used to take a leak in the sink! One time when we were walking through Paris, a car ran over his foot. The driver jumped out to help, but Fran just shrugged like the stoic he was. Next day his foot was so swollen he could hardly walk: that's what Hemingway called grace under pressure. It's like Andy Warhol when he was shot in the guts by that nutty feminist [Valerie Solanas]. When they carried him out on the stretcher, all he said was \"Now don't make me laugh!\" Of course they were different guys. Andy was an idiot savant, but Fran was a fucking genius.'</p> <p>The genius was a generator, transmitting an electrical charge to those around him. 'Francis used to say that 99 per cent of people weren't activated,' Michael Clark recalled. 'He switched you on.' </p> <p>Near the end of our long lunch at Green's, a fish restaurant in St James's that Bacon often patronised, Peppiatt gave me an example of how this vitalising influence worked. A morose waiter brought us our coffee, then wearily retreated. 'You see what an automaton he is?' asked Peppiatt. 'Francis would have twinkled at him, flirted with him, made him a player. I remember once in Paris he ordered, as usual, a ridiculously expensive bottle of wine. The waiter poured it out with tremendous care, and Francis offered him a glass. \"Oh no, monsieur,\" he said, looking over his shoulder, \"la direction!\" But Francis wouldn't allow the management the right of veto. He gave the waiter a glass and told him to sneak into the kitchen with it and drink it later. After a while, the door from the kitchen opened, the waiter peeped out, raised the glass and toasted us. That was Francis: he created excitement, mostly by transgressing the rules. That's what's missing from Love is the Devil. Jacobi doesn't convey Francis's geniality, his love of fun.' Our waiter eventually returned with the bill, hoping to speed our departure; I decided to leave him unactivated.</p> <p>Bacon could deactivate people just as abruptly. 'He thought that friendship gave people the right to lacerate each other,' said Peppiatt. 'He did that to me once. He spent an entire night doing down Hockney, going on and on. \"Leave it alone,\" I said. \"Well of course,\" he shrieked back, \"you with your pathetic taste would think Hockney was worth something.\" I told him off for it when he sobered up the next day.' </p> <p>Beard witnessed another gratuitous outburst, directed at Jerry Hall during a party in a gay disco in Paris. 'I'd introduced Fran to Mick [Jagger] and that was fine, but when Jerry turned up he aimed this thunderball at her. \"You fucking old cow,\" he said, \"you grotesque cunt, you hideous bloody witch.\" He just wouldn't stop; it was this wave of bad vibes. The rest of us went down into some dark pit behind the dancefloor and hid. You can imagine what was going on there, but it was better than being within range of Fran.'</p> <p>When Bacon died, the critic David Sylvester paid him a provocative tribute. Quite apart from Bacon's achievements as an artist, Sylvester described him as 'the greatest man I've known, and the grandest', and listed his staunch moral virtues: honesty, generosity, courage. </p> <p>'I think that's a bit solemn,' said Peppiatt. 'He was mostly wonderful, but his shenanigans could be a pain in the arse. Yet he played up superbly, and he could be very suave when he took the piss. His rudeness was a by-product of his searing determination to tell the truth. He was a great possessor of people, and some of them were swallowed whole.' </p> <p>Or else they swallowed Bacon whole and can still disgorge him on demand, which happened when Michael Clark staged a creepily vivid simulation of his antics in my London sitting room. Clark, channelling Bacon, primped his forelock with a non-existent comb, and freshened his makeup with sideways glances at an imaginary pocket mirror. Having titivated himself, he then nimbly removed an unseen \u00a350 note from his pocket to press it into an open, needy hand that supposedly belonged to Jeffrey Bernard. Groping towards a bar that wasn't there, he wheeled across the floor in a re-enactment of Bacon's swooping gait, which made him look like a dipsomaniac question mark. Clark, in common with Beard, thinks of Bacon as a shaman who painted in a state of trance; during this impersonation, Clark was the shaman who conjured Bacon up before me. The spectacle was ghoulish but somehow touching: by such performances, Bacon's loyalists keep him alive.</p> <p>Even in Bacon's absence, his images retain their terrifying power, a vampirish capacity to imbibe life from those who look at them. For a while, Peppiatt had a portrait that Bacon gave him hanging above his desk. 'It stared at me, and I could never face it down. Nothing in the head had settled, there was unfinished business going on inside the frame. It was so incredibly alive, and it made me feel - how can I say this? - so static. It seemed to be asking me if I was real, and I never knew what to answer.' </p> <p>Peppiatt eventually sold the painting, and ever since has felt an aching regret, combined with relief at having escaped its mute interrogation. The story sums up the impact of Bacon's personality and his art. To know him was to be enraptured, to lose contact with the safe, stable norm; it made the rest of your existence, when you had to return to it, a mournful anticlimax.</p> <h2>Biography: From furniture to fine art</h2> <p><strong>Early life</strong><br>Born in Dublin in 1909 to English parents.

If you missed it, trust me - this was one small piece of a house that is surely part of a proverbial Grand Design. </p> <p>And while I hope Kevin McCloud may one day be persuaded to host a new C4 show along the lines of Through the Keyhole or MTV's Cribs, but with fewer soap stars and/or rappers, so that we may feast our green eyes on lots more posh celebrity gaffs to keep us going, albeit enviously, through the looming negative-equity years, it was with regret that we left chez Dawkins to visit the office of Craig Venter, a man who may have mapped the human genome and shored up the theory of evolution but is disappointingly uninterested in making stylish statement with his workplace interiors.

Either way, it's August and instead of being on Chesil beach searching for a pretty ammonite for my mantelpiece, I've been naturally selected to be stuck in front of the telly, therefore it behoves me to ask bloody stupid questions if I want to. </p> <p>Dawkins topped and tailed the first in this sprauncy three-parter to celebrate the bicentenary of Darwin's birth by deigning to spend quality time with a classroom of kids who were a bit 'like, whatever' about natural selection. Dawkins may have described it as 'a fact, backed by undeniable evidence' but since when did the teenage species let a mere fact get in the way of their gut instinct that adults are basically wrong about everything - even, like, science and stuff? </p> <p>This lot appeared to enjoy their fossil-hunt but it didn't stop them believing in God - 'I'll still say my prayers,' said one of them, smiling, with a smuggy sort of shrug. I know, I know, that Dawkins - such a know-all, eh? Mind you, I can see why he might be slightly worked up about God stuff - try googling the words 'Origin of mankind' and you'll find yourself sent straight to bonkers Creationist Hell, which is depressing. </p> <p>However, some things don't change. The world's oldest profession, for example, doesn't appear to have evolved very much over the past four-million odd years, since, presumably, that lady ape in the Garden of Eden first gave it away for an apple. (That's the story isn't it? No? Really? Are you sure?)</p> <p>In C4's cheerful <strong>The WI Guide to Brothels</strong> the redoubtable Jean and Shirley from the Hampshire branch of the Women's Institute were looking at ways to improve the lot of 'working girls' by exploring global 'best practice' with the help of presenter Nicky Taylor, who herself trod a fine line between collusion and exploitation. While Jean and Shirley were hard at work they were also oblivious, I think, to the fact that Nicky was their pimp. </p> <p>It worked rather brilliantly. Taylor has made a name for herself by being exceptionally unvain in front of a camera - a few years ago she made a film about being a single mother-of-three looking for love, and has since explored binge-drinking, drug-taking and anti-ageing treatments, always putting herself in the middle of the frame. She's a refreshingly unusual presence on TV - a middle-aged non-size-zero mum who combines the sisterly warmth of the sofa-bound daytime presenter with a kind of knowing faux-gaucheness that somehow distracts people from the fact that she's a bit of a Louis(e) Theroux. </p> <p>When you combined Taylor with the excellent Jean and Shirley, who were delightfully unfazed by (almost) everything they discovered in an Amsterdam brothel and 'bunny ranch' in Nevada, then the results were bound to be entertaining. So much so that, in fact, the rather serious message at the heart of the film - which is that decriminalising British brothels is not only desirable but pretty much essential - was in danger of being lost amid such priceless moments as Jean asking a Dutch sex-shop employee if he could 'give me some information about the \"ass midget\".' (He did, and when Jean adopted a too-much-information expression, he politely apologised). </p> <p>Anyway, while Jean and Shirley flew long-haul in order to get to grips with their subject, Taylor explored the industry closer to home, working as a maid inside a knocking shop situated in an Essex business park. The hypocrisy of the law was brilliantly demonstrated at the brothel run by a madame known as 'Dagenham Donna' whose premises' panic buttons were kindly installed by the local police and who happily pays VAT, but when invited by the Inland revenue to register her business as 'a massage parlour' declined on the grounds that, well, it's a brothel, isn't it? </p> <p>This wasn't a film that concerned itself with the whys and wherefores of prostitution itself, taking the continued existence of the Profession as a given, but it was concerned that a young student who goes on the game to fund her crack habit, like Sarah, whom Nicky Taylor met on the kerb of a Southampton industrial estate, should have somewhere safer and more salubrious in which to earn her living, and that's just common sense. </p> <p>Via a consciousness-raising WI-branded mobile brothel (a camper van with a sticker on the side), Jean and Shirley managed to persuade the ladies of the Hampshire WI to sign their petition and delivered it to No 10, where it will presumably remain at the bottom of Gordon Brown's in-tray for ... ooh, I dunno how long, exactly, though I'm thinking along the lines of 'ever'. </p> <p>The rest of us learned a lot, though, not least from 'Airforce Amy', the top earner at a Nevada brothel whose PG demonstration of her XXX-rated 'world-famous upside-down blow-job - it knocks their socks off!' elicited from Jean a fervent 'I should think it does! I'll try that when I get home!', at which one's mind, and various other bits, duly boggled. </p> <p>If there is a god knocking around Manchester's Moss Side, last week he looked a lot like a young bloke with a beard who drove a Lotus and was accessorised by a very fat chequebook. </p> <p>C4's <strong>The Secret Millionaire</strong> is a format to warm your cockles, tug your heartstrings and leave you snivelling happily over the credits. It's absolutely shameless (and in this edition, at least, Shameless) in evoking a Pavlov's Dogs-style emotional response to a set of stimuli: out comes the chequebook, down come the tears, bish-bash-bosh, job done, ta very much. In my more cynical moments I get almost as sneery as I do teary when telly goes all touchy-feely, but I must have been a bit soft this week. </p> <p>Though his modest suburban kitchen didn't offer a clue (it was about a quarter of the size of Dawkins's library), 30-year-old Benamor is worth an alleged \u00a377 million, which he earned by offering loans to people who can't get them elsewhere. I'm not saying he's a shark, exactly, but he's clearly a bit of a business piranha. </p> <p>So it wasn't the ritual dishing-of-the-dosh-to-the-undeniably-deserving (but, I suspect, increasingly clued-up) punters that moved me most (50K to the saintly elderly couple who take in troubled young men I'd cross the road to avoid, 36K to a project teaching kids permanently excluded from school, another 50K to a small local charity, Mothers Against Violence) but the fact that James finally located his own unselfish gene, offering work experience to some of the kids he met and setting up a volunteer programme among his employees. His reward will not only be in all his good reviews, but in heaven, obviously.</p> <h2>Fuel and his money: Dragons pay up</h2> <p>Having all the entrepreneurial nous of, well, a TV critic, I rarely question the Dragons' judgment over potential investments (<strong>Dragons' Den</strong>, BBC2), but last week I was very surprised by their enthusiasm for a widgety-thing that stops diesel tanks being filled with petrol. </p> <p>Mike wanted a whopping 250K for his 'retro-fitted misfuelling prevention device', and probably deserved it just for the description, and verily the Dragons coughed up. On a recent holiday in France I hired a car that had been helpfully fitted with its own 'retro-fitted misfuelling prevention device' - a sticker on the gas cap printed with the word 'diesel'. Not only was it entirely successful but I doubt if it had called for a quarter of a million quid's worth of investment. </p> <p>Anyway, Dragons, how about the revolutionary design concept I came up with over a second bottle of wine sometime in 1989 - the 'soft bath' that moulds to the shape of your body! Any offers?</p>",
  "<h2>Beach beats</h2> <p><strong>DJ and promoter Norman Jay has drawn crowds at beach parties in Italy, Antigua and Goa to his sets featuring disco, funk and classic house. </strong></p> <p><strong>Happy Man, </strong>Chic<br>Chic's disco sound is so summery, and this underrated track from their album C'est Chic has a really feelgood, carnival vibe. </p> <p><strong>Feel So High, </strong>Des'ree<br>I love the way Des'ree mixes soul and folk, and I've followed her career from when she first appeared. 'Feel So High' was her debut single, and it's an incredibly calming tune.</p> <p><strong>The Wind Cries Mary, </strong>Jimi Hendrix<br>I didn't really understand rock when I was young, but this was a tune I really connected with. It's haunting, and has one of the best middle-eight guitar sections you'll ever hear. </p> <p><strong>Summer (The First Time), </strong>Bobby Goldsboro<br>When this first came out I was hooked by the song's repetitive piano riff. It opens up with the sound of waves gently lapping, which really sets the song's blissful tone.</p> <p><strong>Walk on the Wild Side, </strong>Lou Reed<br>An incredible black-feeling rock record - the perfect mix of simple, powerful guitar licks, a bit of gospel, and an unbelievable sax solo. This record reminds me of when I first went on holiday to the south of France, aged 14.</p> <p><strong>Dock of the Bay, </strong>Otis Redding<br>When Redding sings, 'I'm sitting on the dock of the bay/watching the tide roll away', he evokes the essence of water and sunshine. </p> <p><strong>Dear Mr Fantasy, </strong>Traffic<br>A great R&amp;B-sounding rock tune with psychedelic, druggy overtones, perfect for lazing around doing nothing. </p> <p><strong>Walk in the Night, </strong>Junior Walker and the Allstars<br>A very romantic tune, made for a humid night and a moonlit beach walk with your partner. </p> <p><strong>Optimistic, </strong>Sounds of Blackness<br>A soul gospel number with incredibly uplifting vocals. I finished my set with this at beach parties in Ibiza back in the day, and it would always set the crowd off. </p> <p><strong>Love and Affection, </strong>Joan Armatrading<br>This is a chilled-out love song with a nagging melody, which was number onein the charts for weeks during the 1976 heatwave. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Norman Jay's latest compilation Good Times: London is out on Azuli Records on Monday<br><strong>Hugh Montgomery</strong></p> <h2>Family holiday</h2> <p><strong>Sarah Cracknell is lead singer of Saint Etienne, who released a sampler mini-album of children's songs entitled Up the Wooden Hills in 2005. She has two sons, Spencer, six, and Sam, four. </strong></p> <p><strong>Last Train to Clarksville, </strong>The Monkees<br>My kids have suddenly got into older music. Last year they were into things like 'Valerie' by the Zutons, but the Monkees and T Rex are top favourites at the moment. </p> <p><strong>Rockaway Beach, </strong> The Ramones<br>The Ramones are quite child-friendly because everything's fast and to the point, so exciting for small children. They do the stance with legs as far apart as possible.</p> <p><strong>I Want Candy, </strong>Strangelove<br>That's for when my kids start going, 'Can we get a snack, can we get a snack?' as we're driving along the M5 and they beat you into submission by repetitive asking, a bit like Lisa and Bart in The Simpsons. It keeps them going for another three minutes if we play this. </p> <p><strong>The Clapping Song, </strong>Shirley Ellis<br>This is good because you can get them doing something physical - clapping. </p> <p><strong>Young Folks, </strong>Peter Bjorn and John<br>This is on the same theme of giving them something to do: we call it the whistling song. They know all the words. </p> <p><strong>My Boy Lollipop, </strong>Millie Small<br>My younger son, Sam, loves this one. My older son, Spencer, teases him and goes, 'That's for babies!' and I go, 'No it's not!' Then I sing along with Sam.</p> <p><strong>59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy), </strong>Simon and Garfunkel<br>It's a really feel-good song. Driving to the coast, this would be a good one. It's a first-one-to-spot-the-sea-type song, isn't it?</p> <p><strong>Surfin' USA, </strong>The Beach Boys<br>My boys love this one, and whenever we play it they always strip. I don't know why - it's bizarre. They disappear into the bathroom, and then come rushing into the room, 'surfing' naked. </p> <p><strong>Time to Pretend, </strong>MGMT<br>The reason they love it is because it's got dinosaur noises at the start. It's the one they always ask for in the car.</p> <p><strong>Alright, </strong>Supergrass<br>It's a good attitude song. It's so pop, so carefree and easy for them to sing along to. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>London Conversations: The Best of Saint Etienne is out on 29 September<br><strong>Hermione Hoby</strong></p> <h2>Outdoor party</h2> <p><strong>British singer Estelle's single 'American Boy' spent four weeks at the top of the UK charts in April. Her March album Shine debuted in the US R&amp;B albums chart at number six. It has been nominated for the Mercury Music Prize. </strong></p> <p><strong>Gold Digger, </strong>Kanye West<br>Every club you went into in 2005 it was on. It's the ultimate party track - it feels like you're at a club at four in the morning in the VIP suite with champagne everywhere.</p> <p><strong>Lady (Hear Me Tonight), </strong>Modjo<br>It was one of those songs that when it came out, it was like nothing else out there. The fact that it still gets played now means it's a classic. That guitar lick is so upbeat, and it has a dope video too.</p> <p><strong>Please Don't Stop The Music, </strong>Rihanna<br>This has been played in every club I've been to this summer. It makes you want to keep dancing, and you can play it and play it and never get sick of it. </p> <p><strong>Switch, </strong>Will Smith<br>That was everyone's guilty pleasure in summer 2005. If it came on outside a club, everyone would say, 'This is bullshit,' but the moment it came on in the club everyone would sing along. </p> <p><strong>All Falls Down, </strong>Kanye West<br>It reminds me of the summer of 2004, and particularly of Los Angeles. I was back and forth between LA and London all the time that year. It was pretty hectic but that was a track I could chill out to. </p> <p><strong>Poison, </strong>Bell Biv Devoe<br>Bell Biv Devoe were former members of New Edition and that song kept playing in 1990. It's one of those songs where everyone knows it, even if they think they don't.</p> <p><strong>Right Here, </strong>SWV<br>They were one of the first all-black girl groups in the Nineties. With their hair and their style, they looked like what we looked like. </p> <p><strong>End of the Road, </strong>Boyz II Men<br>We sang that in the group I was in with my older cousin at school. I was 13 or 14 and I sang tenor. I was this skinny young kid, and everyone was, 'You can sing that deep!' </p> <p><strong>Are You Gonna Go My Way, </strong>Lenny Kravitz<br>I'm MTV generation, so I watched the video and I was like: 'There's a black girl on drums. Oh my god.' The guitar riffs were insane and you have no choice but to go along with it. </p> <p><strong>A Milli, </strong>Lil Wayne<br>It's just a drum, bass, hi-hat and the sample - and it's one of the biggest tunes in North America. It's like the beat saved hip hop. I'm definitely feeling it.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong><strong>Ally Carnwath</strong></p> <h2>Walking tunes</h2> <p><strong>Seth Lakeman was named Singer of the Year at last year's BBC Folk Awards. A keen walker, Lakeman grew up and still lives in Dartmoor. </strong></p> <p><strong>From the Morning, </strong>Nick Drake<br>It's a lovely song to wake up to, and lyrically very simple but special. It's one that you'd put on your iPod for a walk in the countryside.</p> <p><strong>The Lakes of Pontchartrain, </strong>Paul Brady<br>It's a great story of a guy remembering this girl he met on a distant shore in Ireland. A lot of traditional folk songs are good to walk to because there's a story or a journey involved. </p> <p><strong>Solsbury Hill, </strong>Peter Gabriel<br>A good one if you're trying to clamber up a hill. There's one called Peak Hill that I live next to - I climb it if I've got a moment to get a breath of air and look at the world. This song gets you to the summit if you're struggling.</p> <p><strong>Stupidly Happy, </strong>XTC<br>This reminds me of home. It's a song I was listening to loads in the late Nineties, hanging out camping. You can turn it up loud and listen to it on the moors with a roaring fire.</p> <p><strong>Look at Granny Run Run, </strong>Ry Cooder<br>I find it quite funny - poppy and tongue-in-cheek. I remember my father playing this record on vinyl loads when we used to get back from our Sunday walks. </p> <p><strong>Falling Man, </strong>DBG<br>It's quite a personal song to me and my brother because DBG is such a good friend of ours. It's a beautiful, thoughtful song about climbing up a mountain and how you feel when you get up there.</p> <p><strong>Private Universe, </strong>Crowded House<br>I chose this because of the title, my own private universe. I get to travel around quite a lot but I think that makes you appreciate where you come from.</p> <p><strong>When You're Falling, </strong>Afro Celt Sound System<br>Peter Gabriel guest sings on this one. I love the production and I love his voice. It's a summery song, the sort to put on when you're having a barbecue on the moors. </p> <p><strong>Daniella, </strong>John Butler Trio<br>This is a great, uplifting song. Its groove is addictive, which makes sense for walking.</p> <p><strong>Hounds of Love, </strong>Kate Bush<br>The way she sounds is so colourful. The sounds paint pictures and you can tie them together with what's in front of you.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Seth Lakeman's latest album, Poor Man's Heaven, is out now on Relentless Records <br><strong>HH</strong></p> <h2>Road Trip</h2> <p><strong>Gruff Rhys is the frontman of Super Furry Animals and one half of electropop duo Neon Neon, whose Mercury-nominated album </strong><strong>Stainless Style was inspired by the life of American car mogul John DeLorean.</strong></p> <p><strong>Faster than the Speed of Love, </strong>Giorgio Moroder<br>This is a Bavarian disco classic. You can imagine driving extremely fast along an autobahn through the Black Forest.</p> <p><strong>Ringasd El Magad No 2, </strong>Anna Adamis and Gabor Presser<br>If you are driving through Hungary, you might hear this song on local radio. It has a monster groove and a chorus you can chant along to and punch the air.</p> <p><strong>Observatory Crest, </strong>Captain Beefheart<br>This is very evocative of Los Angeles, so even if you're driving through North Wales, you'll imagine you can feel the desert dust. </p> <p><strong>Portals, </strong>Psychedelic Horseshit<br>Time travel will be a more eco-friendly way of travelling in the future so I chose this track with this in mind. It's got lots of feedback but also a great driving melody.</p> <p><strong>Trans-Europe Express, </strong>Kraftwerk<br>This is ideal for driving through an industrial landscape, when you hit cruise control, but it's also a utopian song about rail travel. </p> <p><strong>Harley Davidson, </strong>Brigitte Bardot and Serge Gainsbourg<br>It's a transatlantic song celebrating the American motorbike, sung in French. </p> <p><strong>Ar Y Ffordd, </strong>Edward H Dafis<br>This is a song about hitchhiking by a mid-Seventies Welsh-language band. Lyrically, it's not that progressive: 'When hitchhiking, you need to show more leg.' I used to hitchhike a hell of a lot and this one keeps you going. </p> <p><strong>Rocket USA, </strong>Suicide<br>This is for when you've been driving for longer than you should - a bit of audio caffeine. </p> <p><strong> Travelling Song, </strong>Pentangle<br>This is one for a rural drive in a battered old car. Drums are crucial to travelling songs and Terry Cox is one of the greatest drummers. </p> <p><strong>Another Travelin' Song, </strong>Bright Eyes<br>This has a driving rhythm reminiscent of Johnny Cash. <strong>\u00b7 </strong><strong>AC</strong></p>",
  "<p><strong>Tracey Emin: 20 Years </strong><br> Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, until 9 Nov </p> <p><strong>Richard Hamilton: </strong> <strong>Protest Pictures</strong><br> Inverleith House, until 12 Oct </p> <p><strong>Sanford Wurmfeld: E-Cyclorama </strong> <br>Edinburgh College of Art, until 5 Sept </p> <p><strong>Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller</strong> <br>Fruitmarket Gallery, until 28 Sept </p> <p>Tracey Emin: 20 Years is an assault of a show. There is no escape from the agony. The corridors are lined with images of abuse, betrayal, sickness and abortion, tales from hell retold in embroidered banners and neon. The galleries are crammed with martyr's relics: hospital tags, bloody plasters, painkillers, failed contraceptives, the famous bed with its stained knickers and stubbed fags - supporting evidence to further jeremiads in prose and video. The soundtracks bleeding from one room to the next alone would make you scream, except that Emin does it for you: at the top of her lungs and naked in Norway, in homage to Edvard Munch. </p> <p>It has to be a joke, this video, doesn't it? Emin couldn't possibly expect us to take this absurd literalism seriously - or could she? This is a question for any visitor to her retrospective. Go round it solemnly by all means (and I never saw so much respectfulness as in Edinburgh), but every now and again ask yourself whether Emin mightn't actually be sending herself up.</p> <p>In the space of six days in 1995, for instance, she endures a hangover, diarrhoea, vomiting, chin scabs, an abscessed tooth, a lung scan, the removal of the tooth and the fitting of an IUD, all documented in a written account accompanied, alas, by assorted forensic items. And what does Emin call this display of self-pity, this melodramatic inflation of her own averagely awful suffering? She jacks it up to The Week From Hell. </p> <p>A school skiing trip as a teenager is so traumatic Emin wets the bed, and in embroidering her tale of the ordeal incorporates a Turin Shroud of a sheet as if she had preserved the original; which, incidentally, is exactly what credulous admirers like to believe, claiming it still smells of urine. Yet the sheer scale of the stain is surely some kind of self-parody.</p> <p>Doesn't the fragment of overheard speech at the bottom of another embroidery, Super Drunk Bitch - 'I have to get Tracey home' - appear like a punchline? And isn't the recriminatory accusation You Forgot to Kiss My Soul a neat satire of her chronic self-pity, especially when written up in Barbie-pink neon?</p> <p>There is an alternative argument - and this is the standard praise of Emin - that she is one of the great tragediennes of our time, that she bears our grief for us, does our bedwetting for us, expresses life's anguish like no other contemporary artist.</p> <p>But almost everything in this show goes against those claims. For 20 years, it seems, Emin's art has been exclusively preoccupied with Emin, and demands that you be just as interested too: in her Margate childhood, her Turkish dad and English mum, in her abortions and broken affairs, her feelings about babies and cats, in the sheer authenticity of her emotions.</p> <p>It is true that she sometimes crystallises the universal condition of self-pity in bright neon - 'It is fucking agony, and I'm alone!' - but Emin is no Munch, coining indelible metaphors of anguish. Nothing is expressed beyond what is stated. And what is stated often sounds so implausible - the lover so jealous he had the windows barred, the abortion where the fetus trickles down her leg - that Emin's authenticity comes into question. Are these lies or exaggerations?</p> <p>If midlife has brought contentment then Emin doesn't show it; she can always return to past horrors and frequently does. In fact, it is hard to see what has changed in all these years. The art still relies heavily on Munch and Louise Bourgeois, with traces of Klee, and the song remains the same: self-pitying, outraged, sentimental, as she herself surely, and humorously, acknowledges. </p> <p>If Emin is the celebrity of the Art Festival<strong>, Richard Hamilton</strong> is the grandee. The founding father of Pop Art has a show of protest paintings at Inverleith House. You might argue that he has never produced anything else, but these works are specifically political, from Hugh Gaitskell mutating into a monster in the era of nuclear proliferation to Tony Blair as an all-American cowboy in Iraq.</p> <p>A whole room full of variations on Swinging London - that back-window shot of Mick Jagger and the art dealer Robert Fraser being driven away after a draconian sentence for drugs, the flashbulb flaring on their handcuffs - shows how eloquent Pop could be. Collaged, overprinted, fitted with real metal cuffs, smeared like newsprint, blurry as a black-and-white telly, the series has become more redolent of the period than the original photograph.</p> <p>It is good to see Hamilton's Treatment Room, a walk-in operating theatre where Margaret Thatcher is administering her own brand of medicine from a video above the operating table in which you are the helpless patient. And it is good to see a poster for his ICA show protesting against conditions in the Maze in the 1980s. Hamilton may have missed the target with Blair but he has been a rare redemptive force in recent British art.</p> <p>At Edinburgh College of Art is <strong>Sanford Wurmfeld</strong>'s oval cyclorama, a vast surround-sound painting made up of fractional variations in the spectrum. Colour appears to change before your very eyes; a fine line of green turns orange at some point you cannot determine. The room swoons and light glows and fades within the painting itself. There is probably a formula of hue, tone, proportion and density to explain these phenomena, but the effects are beautiful beyond science.</p> <p>The talk of the town, though, and the best contemporary art in Edinburgh this festival, comes from the Canadian artists <strong>Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller</strong>. They have six installations at the Fruitmarket Gallery, all strikingly original in their way - the house of books, spines out, a library turned in on itself which transports you a thousand times over through the titles alone; a mechanical ballet over which the viewer has sinister control; a miniature cinema which revolves entirely around you.</p> <p>Most stunning of all is Opera for a Small Room, performed in an eerie shack reached through visible darkness. Inside, among dusty bric-a-brac and walls lined with LPs, eight turntables and a dozen old lights become an orchestra for a dark and shattering tale of disaster. An old radio mic gives out the story, howling like a wolf, weeping, remembering, possibly lying, as the music crosses, merges and swells. It is a thriller in which the sound of a train plays a crucial part. It is an opera without any singers. It is Cardiff and Miller's masterpiece. It is also, as it seems to me, a complete history of music in 20 minutes, as well as a testimony to sound as illusion and to the shocking power of silence.</p>",
  "<p>The term 'wilderness holiday' can cover a fat parcel of differences. It's all relative, isn't it? For Ray Mears, or one of those keen-if-dubious older scouting types who likes to bake bread in rabbit-holes and clean their teeth with ash twigs, it would mean being left naked up a tree, forever, with endless bat guano sandwiches. For the likes of, say, Mariah Carey, or those men who make an inexplicable living writing about expensive watches, it would be having to slum it with cheap-end Bellinis on the plane or plumping up your own pillow. </p> <p>You take what you're used to and ratchet yourself into a world of significant enough difference to feel that you have, for a few days, led a different life. For me, the perfect few days' difference came in Knoydart, the wild, sprawling, forgotten peninsula that forms the mainland gazed at by the Inner Hebrides, and a trip that left me frozen, soaked, exhausted, exhilarated.</p> <p>It hit me, as it always does on the hills (yet I always forget, like childbirth), that it really is all about relativity. The bed may not be the fanciest I've stayed in - a small bunk in a tiny wooden room. The sandwiches were, after 600m of climbing, crushed and soggy. The coffee, back in the bunkhouse, was instant. But. For those few days, because I had done the work, hauled up those sandwiches myself, earned the right to that sunset coffee, deservedly slid into a comfy single bed, I can safely say it was the best food, best coffee, best sleep I could remember. That's what a wilderness holiday is. Plus you get to see a wilderness.</p> <p>And what a one this is. The so-called 'rough bounds' of Knoydart, often described as Britain's last wilderness, can be accessed only by boat, or a very rough 16-mile trek from the east; there are no roads in through the hills. It's a grand, high, wild, difficult place, with splendid but rarely taken walks in the interior and, as importantly, it is lean-across-and-touch close to the torn, crazed, lovely Inner Hebrides: Canna, Skye, Rum, Eigg, Muck.</p> <p>So we come in by boat, having taken the train to Mallaig - one of those thrilling train journeys you forget can exist, the West Highland Line from Glasgow's Queen Street station. Passengers begin to smile at each other as the grandiloquent scenery swells open on either side. The guard works out who the smokers are and tells us at which stops we'll get six minutes outside; all very human and forgotten 1950s Britain, and you also get to go over the Harry Potter viaduct at Glenfinnan. Then the little boat from Mallaig to Doune, a tiny not-even-hamlet, a couple of nicely done bunkhouses and a big kitchen, sitting inside an impossibly romantic inlet. </p> <p>Doune is run by Wilderness Scotland, which specialises in this kind of trip. It lets you know what kind of walking you're going to get - this trip was termed 'moderate' - and gives you a dedicated guide for the week, in this case the splendid Lorraine, who, it turns out, has done every Munro. In a row. In one go, walking from one to the next, sleeping in the hills, friends leaving food at prearranged points. It took four months. Sixteen hundred miles. The equivalent of climbing Everest 30 times. She has been in the papers and everything. I feel rather safe in her hands. </p> <p>And it's a good organisation, comfortable in its own skin, safe without being preachy; and the surroundings are satisfying, warm, everything we need, cosy rooms with their two towels, hot showers, fat sofas, kettles starting to whistle, as those in our eight-strong group begin to get to know each other.</p> <p>And the food, in the evening, is good and plentiful. Very, very fresh. I compliment the tiny bustling chef on the crab, and she beams. 'I'm so glad. Caught it myself just this morning.' By lights out (because of the generator) at 11, we know each other pretty well. Splendid bunch. Some retired, some still busy, some Scots, some English, some who know these hills; we all vie in self-deprecating fashion to say who's going to be the slowest. Unfortunately, I am telling the truth.</p> <p>A sweet, sweet sleep by the sea, a good hot breakfast, and the walking begins. Plans are fluid, depending on the weather on the hills and the state of the water, and on this first day we get to go, gloriously, to Eigg. A half-hour or so's boat ride, with Skye and Rum passing to port in splendid sun, and then we're there. It's hot. I know this is Scotland, but it's hot. But there's a breeze, and I soon stop panting, or at least pant in a semblance of rhythm, and we find our walking legs, and move up towards the dark, looming, sheer, magnificently scary An Sgurr. It's only 393m high, good for our first day, but the fall, on those three sheer sides from the top, is pretty much every one of those 393.</p> <p>And do you know how it got there? Pay attention, because this is interesting. Quite a long, long time ago, children, after the lava-flow from the volcanoes of Rum had created Eigg, before the sea came in to separate the pair, a huge glacier cut through Eigg's lava residue, which was basalt. Way later, it melted. Six or seven million years passed, then there were more explosions, and new, tougher, lava, mainly pitchstone, filled the water-bed. As the years - rather a lot of them - passed, the softer basalt eroded but the pitchstone stayed; hence this massive astonishing lump. It's a dried-up riverbed. Americans call that a monadnock, which I quite like.</p> <p>See, it is interesting. I thought so, at least, wheezing my way up the sides. Today, I am told, it is 58 million years old. Happy birthday, I mutter, feeling marginally older. I find it all even more interesting, terrifyingly so, an hour later, accidentally leading the pack, admiring the reassuringly hard-hewn old Ordnance Survey trig-point I've just passed, turning as I walk to bore someone behind me about how trigonometry works, you see it's clever but simple, by aiming theodolites at these points, which are of course at the very tops of the mountains, surveyors can... Whoah! I sit down. Fast.</p> <p>I have remembered what the top of this thing looked like, from below. I have just breezed past the trig-point. Which is, of course, at the very, very top. I am, moronically, so pleased at getting up, and getting my second wind on the first day, that I have been two feet from walking over the edge. People laugh, in kindly fashion, and stop for lunch, but I have actually started shaking. A panic attack, and even if I am mainly panicking at my own stupidity, it doesn't make breathing any easier. </p> <p>The thing about panic attacks is to know, always, that they will pass; but this is a real doozie and doesn't diminish until I have gaspingly stumbled a half-mile down and back and can see bog-cotton all around me below again; far down but I know I could tumble there and break only a limb, not a head. I start instantly to breathe again and walk upright. What a dork! And I hadn't had an attack for a year. Bugger! And I almost got killed by an old riverbed. </p> <p>But the thing about being out here is that 90 minutes later, down on lowland and sitting by the ruins of a croft, sharing water-bottles, heart back to normal, gazing out at Muck, I feel magnificent. Later, gazing back up at the prow of An Sgurr, I ask whether people often fall off it, in the gloating tones of someone who almost did but is now sitting safe and sun-blasted outside a splendid little tearoom by the harbour at Galmisdale.</p> <p>Our boatman nods in the slow understated fashion that comes from years, feasibly, of auditioning for Bill Forsyth films. 'Old guy. Last year. Standing right on the edge. Heart attack.' Well goodness, but just how unlucky a place can you pick to have a heart attack? Or lucky? What a way to... I muse, unsteadily, on death, and ways to go, and move swiftly to thinking instead, obviously, of tearooms, this one in particular.</p> <p>A few years ago, Eigg was owned by a chap called Keith Schellenberg. Not the world's nicest man, but also one of the most viciously litigious, so... anyway, he didn't really help the islanders of Eigg to make much of a living. Permissions for making improvements were nearly always refused; investment was virtually nil. He wanted a shambolic, rundown Hebridean retreat to preen back to occasionally, an Eloi among the Morlocks. He refused to let them have a bar. You can do that, when you own islands, in wildernesses. Twice a week, the ferry, which was incidentally but happily licensed, would pull in for half an hour. Every man on Eigg clambered on board and drank himself stupid. Women would pull their men off, near comatose, both weeping. Happy, happy days.</p> <p>Today Eigg, now under control of the islanders after lengthy court battles, is thriving magnificently. They have just linked up their own power supply, the island's first network. Walkers arrive daily; lives are allowed to be lived. Teas are served. It is a grand story, and we raise a glass that night to the 80 or so thrawn islanders who made Eigg work.</p> <p>Next day is, as they all are, different. We walk in Knoydart, up a long, twisting isolated glen, towards the apparently splendid peak of Meall Buidhe, hidden in the mist. We pass huge horned Highland cattle, asleep amid misted trees, and a cluster of white ponies, used to haul down stags during the season. We are very much in a wilderness, in Scotland, a knowledge that comes whirling in with the wind and rain. That's the thing about weather: it changes. </p> <p>By 600m the pleasant ramble has become, for me at least, a frozen stinging scramble against wind and rain. We reach the pass, where lunch had been intended, but the world is frozen and mad and Lorraine has to bring out a bivouac sheet, under which we hunch and shiver and drip; the decision is taken that pushing on to the high ridge, the Munro, would be courting pointless misery. It is after all meant to be a holiday. I try not to look too relieved.</p> <p>It's a long, cold trek back, foot after tired foot, but I am strangely happily lost in my own thoughts. Six hours after setting off, we are walking into the Old Forge in Inverie, the most remote pub in mainland Britain. It is a mix of eager blond-wood pretensions and grumpy locals from Central Casting, but it's a bar. There are seats. We collapse, never happier, and two hours later I am sitting down, literally, in what is, in relative terms, the world's most perfect hot shower.</p> <p>And in the morning? Eight of the most solid hours you've ever slept. And the sun is up - has been for hours, in this part of the world in summer - and crossing the dancing grey-blue waters of the Sound of Sleat to shed a forgiving light on the high black gabbro of the top of the Cuillin range on Skye beyond. If you haven't seen these mountains, your first glimpse will inspire muttered thoughts of disbelief: so perfectly sheer and pointy that it all looks just a little... fake. A film set, surely, an unused spare from Lord of the Rings, or put there as an exuberant joke by Slartibartfast, the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy character whose job was designing impossible fjords. </p> <p>But, no, the high tops of the Cuillins are very real, very beautiful, very fall-off-and-break-your-neck; I know this from younger, fitter days, but am delighted to see them now from a safe few miles back, sitting on warm peaty grass with coffee in the morning. (Or gazing at them as we had the night before, ignoring the midges long enough to sit outside the restaurant and watch a sunset of frankly irritating slowness and beauty. 'Orange now,' someone would mutter. 'Yeah. Bit of purple creeping in.' 'Aye.' Whatever. Yawn. 'What's the time?' 'Ten.' 'God, when's the bloody view going to go away... I want my bed.') </p> <p>So, in the morning, the group set out again, chattering. Long days, long climbs; mist and wild wind and sun, and supple hard sinews by the end, and happy scrambles for the showers, and long talks into the night. But I heard about it all later, because I was watching them from the boat, as I had to go home. This saddened me.</p> <p>Walking the filthy streets of King's Cross a short time later, too, too nastily soon, I found myself nearly welling up in self-anger at how unforgivably blas\u00e9 I'd been about it all. I missed the sunsets. I missed the cold, and the aching knees. I missed the panic attack, or at least the views it was obscuring. I missed the wilderness. I almost missed the midges. Almost.

  "<p><strong>I became the guardian of my eight-year-old nephew after several deaths in the family. We live in a bungalow that used to belong to my grandmother. When she died, she left the house in trust for my nephew until he is 25. We are allowed to live in the property on condition that I keep it fully insured and maintained. Recently our central heating boiler broke down. The engineer said it was too dangerous to use. I am a postgraduate student, surviving on a pittance, as well as being effectively a male single parent. I'm eligible for a Warm Front grant, which would fully cover a new boiler, but the Warm Front people turned down my application because the house deeds are in the name of the trustees. The trustees are not my landlords in the traditional sense and I do not have proof that I am responsible for maintaining the property. There is no point getting a tenancy agreement drawn up now because Warm Front will accept only documents dated at least six months before the application. They said they could make no exception. </strong></p> <p><strong>JC, Kelsall, Cheshire</strong></p> <p>Warm Front provides heating and insulation grants for homeowners and tenants who rent from private landlords. It is a government-funded scheme, administered for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs by Eaga, an energy efficiency company. </p> <p>You contacted Eaga for a grant but, as you are well aware, you do not fit into any pigeonhole its application form could handle. You are neither a homeowner nor tenant but are exactly the sort of person Warm Front was designed for. </p> <p>Immediately Eaga saw a copy of your grandmother's will and proof that you are responsible for your nephew, it treated your application as a priority. It has changed the details on your file, which means you are now eligible for a grant of up to \u00a32,700. An engineer will visit shortly to decide how much heating, draught-proofing and cavity-wall insulation you need to make the bungalow an energy-efficient home.</p> <p>For more information about Warm Front, see our article on page 14, or call 0800 316 6005 or visit <a href=\"http://www.warmfront.co.uk\">www.warmfront.co.uk</a> or the Defra website, <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk\">www.defra.gov.uk</a>.</p> <h2>Who does Nationwide think we are?</h2> <p><strong>In 2006, Mr JAG and Mrs EAG (me) took out a mortgage with Nationwide. The building society insisted that Ms EJG, my sister-in-law with the same surname, was also on the mortgage as guarantor. At some stage, Nationwide muddled EJG and EAG and we spent 12 months sorting it out. Our private accounts were compromised when Nationwide sent correspondence to the wrong addresses. </strong></p> <p><strong>We had to move again and told Nationwide last November that the property was to be rented out. We gave our new address in Scotland. That worked until EJG's voting </strong><strong>papers came to our house. I received no voting papers at all. The problem has started all over again.</strong></p> <p><strong>EAG, Elgin </strong></p> <p>Nationwide has discovered that your sister-in-law's details were held correctly on some accounts but that her middle name was written wrongly on others, so she had two different customer numbers. Nationwide put this right but, because her name is on your mortgage, it mistakenly changed her address to yours. This has now been corrected and Nationwide is sending both of you \u00a3100 to apologise. </p> <h2>This transfer fee leaves me at a loss </h2> <p><strong>I took out a TR Property Isa managed by BNP Paribas. I recently contacted BNP Paribas about switching out. It cannot offer suitable alternative funds and refuses to transfer the securities to another Isa manager except by the most expensive route, which is selling the shares at 1 per cent plus VAT and for the new managers to then repurchase them with stamp duty and dealing costs. </strong></p> <p><strong>I have complained to BNP but got nowhere. In a phone call, they said they have to make money somehow. Any remaining tax perks of an Isa investment are more than wiped out by these restrictive rules and charges.</strong></p> <p><strong>R S-T, Watford </strong></p> <p>BNP told me you could transfer your shares directly to a new Isa manager for \u00a320 plus VAT, plus any charges imposed by the new manager. This contradicted a letter, which emphatically said you could not, pointing to the paragraph in the terms and conditions confirming that any transfer out had to be in cash. </p> <p>BNP explains that it always was physically able to transfer shares directly from TR Property Isa but had decided, through terms and conditions, not to allow this. It has now changed its mind and is about to introduce direct share transfers, assuming of course that any new plan manager will accept them. But this news has not yet filtered through the company, which is why you were told otherwise. Someone has now been in touch with you to make the arrangements. </p> <h2>Rocked and rolled over by Cumberland </h2> <p><strong>Just before my one-year fixed-rate investment with Cumberland Building Society matured, I told my local branch on three separate occasions that I did not want the account rolled over for another year. I later asked it to close the account and move the money to my current account. I was told that by </strong><strong>now the investment had been rolled over and I would incur a \u00a31,400 loss of interest penalty if I cashed it in. </strong></p> <p><strong>G O'H, Carlisle </strong></p> <p>Cumberland insists that you received its standard letter sent just before accounts mature. If it receives no instructions to the contrary, bonds are automatically rolled over for 12 months.

  "<p>Part-way through her book, High Tech Trash, gadget expert Elizabeth Grossman breaks off from describing the toxic, polluting innards of our complex consumer electronics and allows herself a short reverie: 'Imagine what it would be like if the price of a new laptop or cellphone covered the cost of a convenient system to collect old equipment for reuse or recycling. Imagine if that price guaranteed a living wage in safe conditions to those engaged in every step of electronic disassembly, material recovery, and manufacture.' </p> <p>So the first rule is to avoid being one of the 14 per cent who just chuck their laptop in the bin. Part of Grossman's dream has been realised thanks to the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (Weee) directive, legislation that puts the onus on retailers to recycle or responsibly dispose of your defunct laptop when you buy a new one from them. </p> <p>But disposal is only part of the equation. Your replacement needs to be the greenest model possible - a Greenpeace analysis of 37 computer products from 14 major brands places the Sony Vaio TZ11 laptop at the top of the table. Greenpeace has also put substantial pressure on Apple (<a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/apple\">greenpeace.org/apple</a>), as many eco geeks considered the company all style and no sustainability. The energy-efficient MacBook Air laptop, with a mercury- and arsenic-free screen, and circuit boards free of PVC may finally begin to appease them. </p> <p>However, you might not be able to get the greenest laptop courtesy of a high-street retailer (the one legally obliged to recycle your redundant model), so this now becomes your responsibility. At <a href=\"http://www.EcoGeek.org\">EcoGeek.org</a>, Hank Green demonstrates how to disassemble your own laptop, selling the good parts off on eBay. You should never think of an old laptop as useless; currently 'less than one in 250 decommissioned computers is made available' for developing-world communities according to <a href=\"http://www.digitalpipeline.org\">digitalpipeline.org</a>. </p> <p>Meanwhile, one billion computer monitors that are in use internationally generate 53m tons of CO2. Altogether the use of PCs and other IT equipment generates the same emissions as the entire aviation sector. You need to choose any computer equipment based on power efficiency in active mode. </p> <p>Thanks to things like 'upgrade fever' we get through computers so quickly that we've overtaken Moore's law (the notion that the amount of computing power that can be bought for a certain amount of money doubles every 18 months). So be honest: do you really need a new one? A bit of restraint might reap ethical dividends because eco computer innovations will continue to get bigger and better. Well, better at least. In fact, designs are getting smaller. The Studio Hybrid by Dell not only uses 70 per cent less power, it is 'the size of a collegiate dictionary'. A surprisingly archaic point of reference to describe this digital innovator, but you get the idea.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk\">lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown called yesterday for communities across Britain to 'rise up' and help end the spiralling violence of knife crime by making the carrying of weapons socially unacceptable.</p> <p>Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival, the Prime Minister admitted to author Ian Rankin, creator of the fictional detective Inspector John Rebus, that the law alone was not enough to bring order to the streets and end the epidemic of fatal stabbings.</p> <p>'Young people are thinking it's acceptable, fashionable, necessary for them to protect themselves, to carry a knife,' said Brown who called for parents and community leaders to help get across the message that carrying a knife put people at greater danger of violence than not carrying one. Just like we made guns unacceptable, we should make knives unacceptable.</p> <p>'You need, not just young people but parents and other people to say that knives in Britain, like guns, like bullying, like racism, all these things are unacceptable.'</p> <p>Brown interrupted his holiday to appear as a mystery guest at the festival, which is celebrating its 25th year, and talk about his own 'second career' as a writer. </p> <p>'There are certain boundaries in a decent society you don't cross and these boundaries are cultural. In America it is acceptable for many people to carry guns, it's not in Britain. We've got to make it as unacceptable to carry knives. Most decent people would want to do that and I think what you will see over the next few months is this sort of campaign, which is led not just by government but people in the country, to say \"get knives off our streets\".'</p> <p>The Prime Minister said one of his biggest ambitions before leaving politics was to see Burmese dissident leader Aung San Suu Kyi released and in power. 'I want Aung San Suu Kyi not only to be released but to be in power in Burma. That's one of the great causes of the 20th century, every country should be a democracy and Burma is one of these countries that has been prevented from doing so. There is a need for China, India and the other countries around Burma to bring pressure to bear on the Burmese government to embrace democracy and respect human life.\"</p> <p>Brown told a packed audience that he had been inspired to write about the dissident Burmese leader in his book of essays Courage: Eight Portraits about great figures who epitomised the great causes of the 20th century such as the anti-apartheid movement, the struggle against fascism, the civil rights struggle in the US and against persecution of the Jews in the Holocaust. </p> <p>Brown said his definition of courage was to have a belief and passion more important than fear and the will power to see those ideals through. 'Twenty-five years ago nobody would have thought that apartheid would have ended by now. Nobody would have thought that Nelson Mandela would be free or that the Cold War would have ended. You can be kind, dignified, humble, altruistic and a dreamer but without courage you can't achieve anything.'</p> <p>In a tribute to US presidential hopeful Barack Obama, Brown said the Democratic contender was a champion for change with a very powerful message in creating the idea of global citizen. 'In the 20th century we got rid of apartheid, racism and fascism. </p> <p>'In the 21st century the real issue is how can we create a global citizenship? We're finding that the barriers that used to exist between countries, religions and traditions are far less important than we thought they were. Global politics can never be the same again.'</p> <p>In a similar vein Brown said the credit crunch, along with rising fuel and food costs, was a worldwide problem that could not be fixed by one government acting alone. 'The problems we have at the moment can only be sorted globally,' he said. </p> <p>'The problem of oil prices, you can't just deal with that in one country, you've got to get co-operation globally to get the price of oil down and to get a change in the way we use oil. ' </p> <p>Brown said his next book, scheduled to be released in March would look at the question of national identity. Being British is a series of interviews and discussions with a number of leading personalities about what being British means to them. </p> <p>The Edinburgh International Book Festival runs until 25 August, with more than 800 events featuring authors and personalities as diverse as Salman Rushdie, Sean Connery, Alan Sillitoe, Menzies Campbell, Louis de Berni\u00e8res and Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond.</p>",
  "<p>If the medium is the message, as Marshall McLuhan said, then contemporary scholars of the advertising world are about to have a field day. Industry executives are privately hailing the dawn of a new age. It is time, they believe, to forget all about brazenly pushing their commercial pitches out to potential consumers who have learnt to switch off mentally during the ad break. In the future the dividing line between entertainment and selling is not only to be blurred but totally irrelevant.</p> <p>The arrival of this wave of what is known as 'content marketing' has already been marked by Shane Meadows's critically acclaimed film Somers Town, which was sponsored by Eurostar and opens in cinemas next week, and by the photographer Rankin's controversial film with Chris Cottam, The Lives of Saints, which was financed by the jeans company Meltin' Pot.</p> <p>Now Prada, the luxury design house, is to wade deep into these uncharted waters by inviting Pietro Scalia, editor of the films American Gangster and Black Hawk Down, to help it to create a series of nine films which will celebrate the launch of a new men's fragrance, Infusion d'Homme. Scalia will put the nine short films together to make a feature length narrative intended to be premiered on the label's own website.</p> <p>The film, Prada executives hope, will follow up on the success of earlier online short films, Trembled Blossoms and Thunder Perfect Mind, which told mysterious and inviting visual stories, while promoting its women's clothes and scents. The fashion house promises that Scalia's film will further 'distance itself' from traditional perfume advertising.</p> <p>'We liked the idea of approaching the world of fragrance with a sensory subversion such as \"seeing smell\",' said Tomaso Galli, Prada's communications director. 'The web is more and more about entertainment and we wanted to provide a new, fun, easy, non-commercial tool to launch this new product.'</p> <p>Describing an activity like this as 'non-commercial' might be judged a stretch by some. Others might deem Prada to be at the more creditable end of the scale when it comes to subversive, content-led branding. After all, in a Prada film there can be little doubt in the viewer's mind about who has made these films and why.</p> <p>The origin of Shane Meadows's Somers Town is less clear. The f\u00eated director of This Is England used his London-based advertising agency, Mother, to broker a new kind of funding deal with Eurostar, another of the agency's clients. Eurostar put up the \u00a3500,000 Meadows needed to make the film.</p> <p>The director claimed he retained complete artistic control of the black and white film, which is set near Eurostar's new London St Pancras terminal and features a character who works for the cross-Channel rail company. The film won the top prize at the Edinburgh Film Festival and it is in that same city this month that visitors can enjoy Mother's latest foray into the world of entertainment. Under the auspices of Mother Vision, its three-month-old 'entertainment content unit', its show Pot Noodle: The Musical has been attempting to attract audiences alongside the thousands of other shows on at the Fringe Festival this month. </p> <p>The show, which 'is very loosely based on Hamlet', features a scene in which a troupe of dancing factory workers pluck noodles from trees and has been funded by Unilever, which is the producer of Pot Noodle.</p> <p>Ed Fayers of Mother Vision challenges anyone who watches Somers Town to detect that one of the producers is Eurostar. 'Somers Town lives and dies on whether it is a good film. And Pot Noodle: The Musical is doing the same thing - going out there and performing at a festival. We do want to entertain and we have always worked with incredibly talented collaborators. In the future one of our funders might be the Arts Council. It is a completely new world.'</p> <p>Gustavo Sousa, a Mother Vision writer involved with Somers Town, believes that the critics are too cynical. 'It is a very new area. It was not the normal thing where Eurostar has a new service to promote or something like that,' he said.</p> <p>The team at the agency believe that they are simply responding to the fact that audiences are now able to dodge more conventional forms of advertising. 'They have invented machines that allow people to whizz through the ads on television. Perhaps we should stop forcing things at people,' said Al McCuish, the creative director of Mother Vision. 'There are still some very good ad spots, of course, which are interesting, but we have to try an awful lot harder.' </p> <p>The bottom line for the advertising industry is that it now has even more limited opportunities for grabbing public attention and that the most important thing for any brand is to find a way to appear contemporary and relevant. A move into entertainment is the clear solution.</p> <p>'Happily, most people who work in the creative industry already have an ambition to entertain,' said Mother's Ed Warren. 'We are always wanting to produce things that make people laugh, smile and think. The key is that product placement in a film, say a watch in a Bond film, was quite crass, but in Lord of the Rings, on the other hand, the film did an enormous amount for tourism in New Zealand, where it was filmed, without affecting the content in any way.'</p> <p>For a veteran analyst of the advertising scene such as Peter York many of these arguments have a familiar ring: 'It isn't new. If you look back, every form of content imaginable has been sponsored or tricked up at one time by pressure groups and companies and, of course, by politicians.' </p> <p>The trouble for the industry, according to York, is that people will always want to know where a piece of art or entertainment came from and so cast a sceptical eye at the credits. The public is wary of what he calls 'a distortion in the marketplace for ideas'.</p> <p>This month Meadows's new advertisment for Asda is released. In a sharp turn away from celebrity-led campaigns, the supermarket chain has asked the Bafta-winning film-maker to direct the latest ad for its George back-to-school clothing range. The ad, which was created by Fallon, features children from the north of England mucking around and playing tug-of-war in their school uniforms. </p> <p>Like Mother, Fallon clearly wanted Meadows to participate because of his track record of conveying an honest and realistic image of children in his feature This is England. Whether he can claim complete artistic freedom on the Asda project is less clear.</p>",
  "<p>With energy bills set to soar across the board in the wake of major price hikes from British Gas and EDF Energy, there has never been a better time to start changing your habits at home to help bring your bills down.</p> <p>There is a lot more you can do than just switching to energy-saving light bulbs. According to the Energy Saving Trust, the average household could knock \u00a3270 off its energy bills - the equivalent of 1.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions - by adopting energy-efficient measures in the home. Even the smallest of actions, like turning a kettle off at the mains after you've boiled it, can not only help you be kinder to the environment, but also make a difference to your electricity bills. 'Taking a sustainable approach to living can save you money,' says Alex Lambie, founder of the eco-energy website Greenhelpline.com.</p> <p><strong>Say goodbye to standby</strong></p> <p>Arguably the biggest waste of electricity - and money - is to leave electrical appliances on standby, rather than switching them off at the mains. It can save the average family around \u00a338 a year. </p> <p>But if you keep forgetting to switch the socket off, or think it's too much of a hassle because you've got too many appliances linked to each other, there are easier ways to power down - for instance, by using devices like the Bye Bye Standby and the Standby Buster. You just plug all your appliances into one of these gadgets (for example, by using an extension lead to connect your television, DVD player and sound system, and plugging that into the Bye Bye Standby at the socket). You can then turn the whole lot off at the switch by clicking a simple remote control. </p> <p>Jeff Ellis from Bye Bye Standby says: 'It's a good habit to get into, to turn everything off last thing at night, but in reality it's a rare person that will go around the house and turn off every single socket. A remote-controlled way of doing it makes it much easier.' You can also buy devices such as The Owl, which monitor overall electricity usage in the home and tell you how much energy each of your appliances is using.</p> <p><strong>The eco-friendlier kitchen</strong></p> <p>If you are buying new white goods, the manufacturer's information should tell you how energy-efficient they are. Fridges, freezers, washing machines and tumble dryers all carry an EU energy label giving their energy-efficiency ratings (on a scale from A to G, with A being most efficient) and how much electricity they use, measured either as kilowatt hours per year (for a fridge or freezer) or kilowatt hours per cycle (for items like washing machines). By choosing an appliance that carries an A rating (or A+++ for fridges and freezers), the more money you can save and the more you can help the environment.</p> <p>Many electrical appliances also carry an 'Energy Saving Recommended' sticker, a blue label showing approval from the Energy Saving Trust. The trust says that if everyone in the UK upgraded their old kitchen appliances to ones carrying a recommended sticker, the whole country could save nearly \u00a3700m worth of electricity. If you swapped your old fridge-freezer for a new blue-label one, you could save \u00a334 a year. </p> <p>There are smaller changes that you can make in the kitchen too - replace a rusty, leaky kettle with an energy-saving one, such as the Kenwood Energy Saving Kettle, and you'll be using 35 per cent less electricity and only boiling as much water as you need. </p> <p><strong>Hold the heat</strong></p> <p>Making sure your home is properly insulated is key to cutting your heating costs. However, getting your walls and loft insulated can be expensive - at least \u00a3500 if not more. If you are on benefits, or are over 60 and in receipt of benefits, you can apply for a government grant to improve your home's insulation. But if you can't afford to carry out a major project like re-insulation, you could opt for the Radiator Booster, which sits on top of your radiator, captures the heat rather than letting it escape down the back of your radiator, and circulates it evenly around the room. The Radiator Booster claims to heat your room more quickly than the radiator on its own, meaning that, theoretically, your boiler doesn't need to be on for as long. </p> <p>Old boilers are notoriously eco-unfriendly and not very cost-efficient. New condensing boilers can save at least a third on heating bills. On top of this, devices such as the Zenex Gas Saver can sit on top of your boiler, capture waste heat from the flue and use it to pre-heat the water. Because it helps heating to happen more rapidly, it reduces the time your boiler needs to be on for, cutting gas consumption by up to 50 per cent. But it does cost \u00a3595.</p> <p>Most cost-cutting can, however, just be common sense. 'There is a place for new energy - and cost-saving gadgets, but at the end of the day, it's just about changing habits and getting used to doing things differently,' says Lambie. 'There's so much that you can do if you just think about it - don't leave your phone charger plugged in all the time; run your laptop battery down to zero before you charge it up again. If you make a point of switching all the sockets off at night, then before you know it, it's part of your daily routine.'</p> <h2>Where to buy</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Bye Bye Standby energy saving kit (\u00a329.99) available from Waitrose, Comet and Currys.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Radiator Booster (\u00a314.99), Eco Kettle (\u00a334.99) and Standby Buster Kit (\u00a329.99) available from Nigel's Eco Store: <a href=\"http://www.nigelsecostore.com\">www.nigelsecostore.com</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Zenex Gas Saver (\u00a3595) available from Zenex Technologies: 0800 328 7533</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Kenwood Energy Saving Kettle (\u00a339.95) and Owl Wireless Energy Monitor (\u00a334.95) available from John Lewis:<a href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com\"> www.johnlewis.com</a></p> <p>For more on grants for home insulation, visit <a href=\"http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk\">www.energysavingtrust.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Two war-torn towns deep in the Caucasus yesterday presented mirror images of violence and retaliation. In the Georgian town of Gori, 50 miles from the capital, Tbilisi, buildings burned and scores of bodies lay in the street following a Russian bombardment. A trans-shipment point for Georgian soldiers heading to South Ossetia, by yesterday Gori was coming under sustained Russian aerial attack.</p> <p>As Georgian soldiers fled their base in the town for the fields and woods, it was the civilians who bore the brunt as a bomb hit a block of flats, leaving them to cradle their scores of dead.</p> <p>There are no such photographs yet from Tskhinvali, capital of the separatist enclave of South Ossetia. It was attacked on Friday by Georgia, an assault aimed at wresting back the region of fewer than 100,000 people from de facto independence. Many hundreds were killed and most of the city's buildings devastated. Instead, it was yesterday left to witnesses to describe what had happened, even as Russian troops fought to consolidate their hold after driving the Georgians out of the northern suburbs.</p> <p>'The night before, a Georgian attack was finally repelled,' said Olga Kiriy, a reporter for Russian TV Channel 1 who spent Friday night sheltering with civilians in a basement during the Georgian assault. 'They have left burnt-out tanks. They were firing at us for a long time. The retreating Georgians left a sniper, but the Russian troops have knocked him out. Just now we were shelled again by Georgian Grad missiles.'</p> <p>But amid the chaos, one thing seemed clear - Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili's extraordinary attempt to reconquer the separatist region of South Ossetia appeared to be unravelling, as Russian planes bombed ever deeper into Georgia and his troops were sucked into street-to-street fighting.</p> <p>In Tskhinvali - briefly occupied in its entirety by Georgia's US-trained troops - furious fighting was continuing between Russians in the city's north and Georgian forces in the south and centre.</p> <p>And as Georgia's attempt to capture South Ossetia ran into the sand, the country was plunged into chaos as Saakashvili called for a ceasefire, his government declared a state of war and the National Security Council said it might call for foreign military intervention.</p> <p>Meanwhile separatists from Georgia's Abkhazia region also entered the fray, announcing that they had started operations to force Georgian troops out of the disputed Kodori Gorge with aircraft and artillery fire.</p> <p>Georgia's worst nightmare has come true. Russian tanks and armoured cars, packed with soldiers, rolled over the border, through the Caucasus mountains, on to Georgian land, and Russian fighter jets were streaking across the skies.</p> <p>For most people in Georgia, this was a Russian invasion, regardless of the fact that Georgia had initiated the fighting. 'This is an overt, open attempt to destroy Georgia, to bring Georgia to its knees, to put an end to Georgia's independence,' said Saakashvili, in one of a series of televised speeches to his increasingly fearful people. 'Unless we stop Russia, unless the whole world stops it, Russian tanks will go to any European capital tomorrow,' Saakashvili warned. It was a note of desperation.</p> <p>Inevitably it has been civilians who have borne the brunt of the conflict, with both sides levelling accusation of atrocities and ethnic cleansing. </p> <p>What seems beyond doubt is that the Georgian assault that began on Friday - after two weeks of increasingly heavy skirmishes between separatists and Georgian forces - was massive and indiscriminate as volleys of Grad missiles rained down on Tskhinvali and neighbouring villages. </p> <p>Refugees also claimed that civilians were shot, kidnapped and burnt to death by rampaging soldiers in areas occupied by Georgian troops. Russian television has broadcast claims that Georgian troops 'executed' injured Russian peacekeepers based in Tskhinvali who were captured during the initial assault: 10 peacekeepers were killed and up to 150 injured during the rocket and air attack.</p> <p>Among those fleeing was Lusya Khoriyeva, 40, a housewife from Tsunari in South Ossetia, one of an estimated 4,000-5,000 refugees who have arrived in the Russian North Ossetian capital of Vladikavkaz, in the past two days. </p> <p>'I spent three days in our basement with two of my neighbours,' she said yesterday. 'The Georgians were bombing from the air and with Grad missiles. Then their tanks rolled into the village at 3am on Friday. People shouted, \"Run, run!\" We crawled out of the basement. Our Home Guard fighters were running too: their ammunition was finished. I saw one man hit by a rocket. It took off his head and splattered it against a wall.</p> <p>'We crawled to a field of wheat. A shell landed near me, but did not explode. Another fell in the wheat and set it on fire. My robe was burning. I could hear girls screaming: \"Don't kill me!\" The Georgians were rounding them up. We escaped beyond the field. I came here in a car with 15 people in it. My son, my husband and my daughter are there. I don't know what has happened to them.'</p> <p>Alisa Mamiyeva, 26, an English student from Znaur region, added: 'Georgian soldiers flung open the doors of our houses, marched in and destroyed everything. Women were hiding in barrels of salted cheese to avoid being taken.'</p> <p>Another woman from the same area said: 'They are going from door to door, killing. A few of us escaped in a car but my brother and my aunt and uncle are still there.'</p> <p>Zarema Kochieva, 45, the owner of a small shop in Tskhinvali, managed to flee with her two daughters to Vladikavkaz on Thursday. 'My husband stayed behind to fight,' she said. 'Our men have only automatic rifles against tanks. He told me he ran into our apartment. A Georgian tank saw him and fired at our apartment block, destroying half of it. There are constant firefights. I think my brother may be already dead.'</p> <p>Anatoly Kabisov may not have been the first victim of South Ossetia's dirty little war; it seems certain he will not be the last. But he is emblematic, at least, of how, in a few short days, it spiralled out of control. In a conflict where truth and blame have been hard to determine, how he died represents the complaints of South Ossetia's Russian-speaking separatist movement in the run-up to war. </p> <p>On the night of 1 August, they say, Kabisov, a separatist 'policeman' from the village of Mugat, was killed by Georgian fire from an outpost near the village of Dvani. As his comrades took his body to be buried, Georgians opened fire on the funeral procession as well.</p> <p>Georgia has its own stories to explain the collapse into violence on Friday as the world sat down to watch the Olympic opening ceremony in Beijing. The day before Kabisov died, according to Saakashvili, separatists exploded a bomb next to a Georgian police car in the village of Eredvi, wounding six.</p> <p>But if one thing was certain in Tskhinvali before the outbreak of war, it was that separatist leaders and their people were united in one certainty - if Georgia attacked, they would not be deserted.</p> <p>'All we see is Georgia preparing for another war. But we won't be alone,' Boris Chochiev, the rebels' deputy foreign minister warned The Observer before the bombing in Eredvi. 'It would be a war of the Caucasian peoples against Georgia, and Russia would be obliged to protect its citizens. About 98 per cent of South Ossetians have Russian passports.' </p> <p>'Stalin divided Ossetia between the Russia and Georgia, but you cannot split one heart in two,' 76-year-old Lev Valiev said in what was once Tskhinvali's sleepy main square. 'We should be reunited, like Germany was, and that means joining Russia. And if we have to fight for that, it would be the Caucasus versus Georgia.'</p> <p>While the first statement has proved brutally true, the threat of the second is looming as across the Caucasus fighters have volunteered to join on the Russian side. In Chechnya, pro-Kremlin leader Ramzan Kadyrov offered his fighters as unlikely peacekeepers, despite their reputation for kidnap, torture and murder to quell a rebel insurgency. In Abkhazia and Dagestan, other volunteer units were forming, while Cossacks were also flocking to the cause.</p> <p>And it is precisely this that may now be Georgia's greatest problem - that it has unleashed a wave of violent hatred against it across the region.'</p> <p>'The West and Nato back the revanchist policies of Georgia. But in the Caucasus you can't arm one side to the hilt and expect the other side to take it,' Abkhaz foreign minister Sergei Shamba in the separatist capital of Sukhumi, warned before the outbreak of war.</p> <p>For its part, Tbilisi insists there can be no compromise over South Ossetia being part of Georgia. Historically, however, the Ossetians have always been more allied to Russia than those who resisted the expansion of the Russian empire into the area in the 18th and 19th centuries, with many fighting alongside the Russians against neighbours who had long been rivals. Ossetians also allied with the Bolshevik forces when they occupied Georgia in the early 1920s.</p> <p>As the Soviet Union disintegrated and Georgia declared independence, the South Ossetians and Georgians fought over Tskhinvali in a conflict that led to South Ossetia's de facto independence.</p> <p>Since then, a stalemate has persisted in a tiny region where two thirds of the population are separatists, many holding Russian passports, and a third consider themselves Georgians. </p> <p>In November 2006, separatists voted to secede while Georgians voted equally as emphatically to remain. While compromise seemed impossible, it was the arrival of Saakashvili on the political scene that changed the dynamic.</p> <p>One of Saakashvili's promises since becoming president had been to re-integrate South Ossetia and Abkhazia into Georgia. The separatists, he said, could enjoy almost unlimited autonomy - but not independence. It was not enough.</p> <p>'He seems to have flipped,' said James Nixey an expert on the Caucasus at the Royal Institute for International Affairs. 'He has walked into a great bear trap. It is not that he was unprovoked. But it seems he has, in 24 hours, scuppered all the hard work he had put into pursuing Nato and EU membership.'</p> <p>It is precisely this that has acted as the dangerous accelerant, pushing Russia and Georgia ever closer to war.</p> <p>Nixey sees in Saakashvili a man of contradictions. With his fluent English, he appears remarkably Western and cautious, but in his native 'Georgian speaking to other Georgians', Nixey observes, he sounds like a hardline nationalist. 'Even his friends,' he adds, 'see him as something of a loose cannon.' But if Saakashvili - perhaps prodded by advisers who had persuaded him that South Ossetia could be quickly retaken and the Russians fended off by the US - has made a historic mistake, Nixey does not absolve the Russians from responsibility for goading Georgia.</p> <p>'Russia has been waiting for this to happen. They had put enough of a mechanism in place that, if they needed to take over, they could do it very quickly. They have made that clear. They have been making bilateral deals with the \"government\" of Abkhazia, too, over exploration rights and cutting off Georgian exports such as wine and cutting flights.'</p> <p>That phoney war was been swept away by the fierce heat of the fighting as Tskhinvali has crumbled between the two sides. </p> <p>'There is a massive bombardment that has been going on between the city's north and south,' Mikhail Lebedev of Russia Today, told The Observer by telephone not far from Tskhinvali. </p> <p>'It has not been retaken. There are Georgian troops with tanks in the town's centre and Russian forces on their way to meet them. </p> <p>'We were in a village close to the town earlier and saw many civilian buildings destroyed. It looks like a Swiss cheese. The university and hospital have been destroyed. I just spoke to the Russian commander in the town and he says there have been very serious civilian casualties.</p> <p>'Where we are we can see more Georgian troops driving into town. Seven truckloads a few minutes ago. We are anticipating very serious fighting.'</p>",
  "<p>Oh, I'm completely shameless!' laughs Katy Perry, agreeing with the idea I've just voiced that pop music only works if the performer is genuine about it, without a trace of shame or sheepishness. 'I love pop music. I've been around kids that hate selling records and enjoy being the starving artist. But I want to play stadiums. I want to sell records. I want to be a pop girl!'</p> <p>Perry has just done a morning photo session for OMM in a gloriously kitsch house in Philadelphia that we borrowed for the occasion. She had arrived in her pyjamas looking bleary after yet another night on the tour bus, but quickly perked up when she saw her surroundings, posing in the circus-themed kitchen with the owner's cockatiel perched on her shoulder and swivelling round so the camera could see the big strawberry-shaped pockets on the back of her cute new shorts - 'I want to show off my berries!'</p> <p>The look is sexy, yet sweet; both girly and powerful; a beguiling mix of bubblegum and burlesque. She can pout and part those scarlet lips like a pro, but then she'll suddenly undermine the vamp image by opening her blue eyes wide and giving the camera a kooky look that is pure I Love Lucy. Or rather it would be, if Lucille Ball had dyed her hair raven black, had 'Jesus' tattooed on her wrist and a single at the top of the US charts declaring, 'I kissed a girl'.</p> <p>A smart, perky 23-year-old with a cheeky sense of humour, a strong, throaty voice and an ear for anthemic hooks, Perry looks likely to fulfil her pop ambitions this year. Her single was in its fourth week at the top of the Billboard charts when we met at the end of last month, and even though it isn't due to drop here for another three weeks, it's already getting so much radio play that workmen and cabbies across the UK can be caught singing that they kissed a girl, they liked it - and that they hope their boyfriend don't mind it.</p> <p>Inevitably, the song has caused controversy, outraging the self-appointed guardians of American morality who say it encourages impressionable young girls to experiment with same-sex snogging. More depressingly, the small but vocal section of the gay community that seems to search for things to be offended by has accused her of exploiting lesbianism for straight titillation. Both sides have missed the point, says Perry: the song is about drunken curiosity, not a call to change sexual orientation.</p> <p>'I'm talking about the way girls are really touchy-feely and sisterly. Especially when we're growing up. We're holding hands, we're having sleepovers, we're doing choreographed dance moves in our pyjamas, we're painting each other's nails and practising kissing on our arms - or maybe practising kissing on one another. It wasn't something that we were doing for the sake of anybody else because we were scared of boys. I know I was scared of boys! My first kiss was with a boy, and he almost swallowed me alive. I wish I had kissed that girl I had the girl-crush on when I was growing up. I would have been much more prepared for my dating life, I think.'</p> <p>Female musicians, she says, are expected to become poster girls for good living. 'What happened to being rock'n'roll?' she muses. 'I play music, I'm not running for President. If only the world would stop walking on eggshells and get a sense of humour. Everyone has their shield up and they're just like: \"Offend me! I'm ready to be offended!\"'</p> <p>There is also a certain double standard at play here. Lil Wayne's 'Lollipop', is just a couple of places below her in the US chart, yet his ode to oral sex is not attracting the same attention. Perhaps the guardians of Christian morality think the kind of kids who listen to rap are already beyond saving or they just can't decode the language. 'Lil Wayne's not talking about a real lollipop,' Perry says indignantly. 'He's talking about his dick! All I'm talking about is a simple kiss.'</p> <p>Katy Hudson grew up in Santa Barbara, California (Perry is her mother's maiden name, adopted to avoid confusion with the actress Kate Hudson). The middle child of two travelling Methodist ministers, she lived a sheltered life, with the radio tuned to Christian stations and secular music channels blocked from the household TV. She began performing in church.</p> <p>'I was singing standards like \"Oh Happy Day\". That was my only door into music. I didn't know that there was a New Kids on the Block out there because the people that I surrounded myself with had the same upbringing [as me] - all gospel and Christian music.'</p> <p>In her early teens she began travelling to Nashville - the hub of America's thriving Christian music industry - to work with other songwriters. In 2001 she released her first album, Katy Hudson, a collection of devotional tunes. It wasn't a big deal, she shrugs, just one part of a busy adolescence. It sold only a few hundred copies. </p> <p>'It was sold out of the back seat of someone's car, practically, and just after the record came out, the label went bankrupt. I'm not ashamed of it - everyone's looking for me to be, \"Well, I'm so ashamed of it and that's why I kissed a girl!\" No way! I still have \"Jesus\" tattooed on my wrist. And I still have a faith and a foundation of my own.'</p> <p>Still, she was also starting discover that there was more to music - more to life - than gospel. She'd been sneaking secular music into her bedroom to play, stuffing her duvet into the crack under her door to muffle the sound. Then she had a revelation: she found a song and an artist who showed her a whole universe of new possibilities. 'It was a moment where everything kind of went in slow motion,' she enthuses. 'The clouds moved away, the sun started shining and I was like: 'I've found it! I've found an artist I want to be like.' Everybody has that one person they want to be, that poster on the wall: Elvis, Madonna. For me it was a song called \"Killer Queen\" - I wanted to be like Freddie Mercury.' </p> <p>Later she had a love affair with the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds and began exploring female-fronted rock: Alanis Morissette, No Doubt, Garbage, the Cranberries as well as older acts like Heart, Joan Jett, Pat Benatar and Cyndi Lauper. 'I like women who are very strong, confident, fun,' she says. 'People who have their own stamp.'</p> <p>But it has always come back to Freddie, which may explain her own well-developed sense of camp. A current favourite on the tour bus is the documentary Paris is Burning, which examines the 'voguing' dance craze in New York in the late 1980s and the drag queens and transvestites who led it. 'It just amazing!' she exclaims. 'The things they say, the way they live their lives with such a fierceness. It's very, very bold. Whenever anyone does my makeup, I say I want to be a couple of degrees away from being a drag queen. I want fun on my face! None of this natural stuff.'</p> <p>Her parents may have been strict, but when Perry dropped out of school at 17 and moved to Los Angeles to further her pop career, she did so - if not quite with their blessing - with their permission. As a result they are still close, and she talks of them warmly. 'They're great. I mean, they still pray for me. They have their thoughts on who I will be and what they want me to be. But I have my own thoughts on that, too. I stopped trying to change them at 21, because I was like: \"You're happy. You love what you do, and I respect that. You're living your life and I'm living mine.\"'</p> <p>She says they weren't surprised by the content of her new album One of the Boys. 'They've always known I had a big mouth, and a kind of quirky outlook on life.' They were away preaching in Malaysia just before the album's release, so missed their daughter's meteoric rise. When they came to the launch party in LA, she laughs, what shocked them was not so much the lyrics as the amount of attention it was getting.</p> <p>Like Alanis Morissette without the anger ('I have angst, but it's not my main message. It's a bit boring, I think.'), a Pink without the need to blame her parents ('I had a great upbringing, I'm fine with it.'), Perry's feisty, upbeat music is the kind that Lily Allen might have produced had she grown up in Christian California. </p> <p>The songs are confessional slices from Perry's diary, served up with a healthy dose of self-mocking humour. 'I'm out on my own again,' she sings on her hangover song 'Lost', 'face down in the porcelain.' Elsewhere, she sings about waking up after a drunken trip to Vegas and wondering whether the ring on her finger means she's done a Britney and got married ('Waking up in Vegas'); and her doomed relationship with a metrosexual man who steals her accessories is lampooned with a jaunty chorus that runs 'you're so gay - and you don't even like boys' ('Ur So Gay').</p> <p>Her overnight success has been a long time coming. After settling in LA, she signed a deal with Island and then another with Columbia before finally finding the right home on Virgin. '[My previous labels] had me doing the dog-and-pony show of \"if you do this, we'll do your solo record\". I wanted to do that record, so I sang with other people, I tried out all kinds of different bands, but it wasn't ever right like it is now.'</p> <p>In her seven years in LA, she saw friends release three albums while she waited to complete her first; she watched careers ebb and flow. 'At the time I thought I was failing, but I'm glad I didn't put a record out when I was 17, 18, 19. I feel I have more of a point to my existence now, and I definitely didn't have the songs then like I do now. I'd just been like flexing the muscle of songwriting and there comes a point when you're ready, to run that race.'</p> <p>Right now she is on a marathon: six weeks into the Warped tour, with four more weeks to go. A travelling circus of around 100 bands, skateboarders and market stalls, Warped is a US institution that has run every summer since 1995. It's a gruelling experience: the bands aren't given their time slot until the day and the stages always have two lots of gear set up - as one act plays, the previous one rapidly packs up their gear and the next one starts setting up. </p> <p>'I was like \"Holy shit! Am I going to survive this?\"' says Perry, 'Because I know bands that come back and they're just exhausted afterwards. There's none of the props and production values I'll have in the future. There's no sound-check, you just set up, play your 35-minute set and get the hell off. I'm usually following the last screamo hardcore punk band, facing this sea of black hoodies, and I'm in this little dress and trying to jump off the monitors like the boys. See, I have a Les Paul [guitar] too - but it's fucking bubblegum pink!'</p> <p>Perry has the added pressure of a hit single. Her mornings are mostly taken up with interviews, photo sessions and promotional meet-and-greets; her afternoons with performing; her evenings with travelling vast distances to the next venue. Sleep, she says wryly, has been the main casualty. 'I'm using a lot of under-eye cream.'</p> <p>Many artists in her situation would have bailed out of the tour by now, but Perry is determined to see it through. While her boyfriend, Travis McCoy, is also on the tour with his band Gym Class Heroes (she makes a cameo appearance in the promo for their recent US hit 'Cupid's Chokehold'), her motivation to see the tour through isn't so much to stand by her man - 'I'm not a needy girl, we Hudsons are very independent' - but more to show she can stand equal to any of them. 'They're saying this is the worst tour I'll ever do,' she says with some relish. 'I may be a pop girl, but I'm surviving Warped. And I don't think many of them bitches could!'</p> <p>A few hours later Perry struts on stage in Camden, just over the river from Philadelphia, waving a pink parasol in the air. The sound quality is terrible but her energy is contagious, and soon she has her pink guitar strapped on and is rocking out with the best of them. There is a moment when some boys start chanting the name of the next band but they are quickly shouted down by the rest of the crowd. 'My fans are better than your fans,' she says archly, before leading the whole audience in a singalong version of 'Ur So Gay'.</p> <p>For many of the bands here, Warped will be a career highlight; for Perry, it's clearly just the start. She has plans, lots of plans. There will be an acoustic album at some point; more theatrical tours with real production values; and with the next album, she'll be able to work with some of the bigger producers she failed to snare this time, explore even bolder themes with the same humour and honesty. 'It doesn't have to be sexual,' she grins. 'Just bold.</p> <p>It's been a long journey, she adds, 'But the reason I kept going was that void for me was never filled. There was never that girl that I wanted to see on stage.' And now there is. Freddie Mercury, I think, would have been proud. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 'I Kissed a Girl' is available now as a download and gets a physical release on 1 September, One of the Boys is released on 14 September (both on Virgin).</p>",
  "<p>With its rich maritime history and container ships chugging in from places such as Manila and Algiers, you'd think Southampton would be touched by flashes of exoticism. But you won't find it in the bland sprawl of the city's shopping centre and, aside from daydreamy synth janglers Delays, culturally, it hasn't got much to shout about either: Benny Hill, the drummer from Coldplay and Craig David. Not that local quartet Thomas Tantrum are complaining. </p> <p>'It's pleasantly outside London,' says Megan Thomas, the Bambi-eyed frontwoman over afternoon drinks in a sleepy pub. 'We're not on the ball with what's cool and we do what we want. It's healthy not being stuck in the middle of a cliquey scene.'</p> <p>Megan (24) and bandmates Dave Miatt (26, guitar), Ken Robshaw (31, drums), and Jim Shivers (22, bass) share a love of art-punk groups such as Television but make music with a distinctively English twist. Their name evokes a petulant child in Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and Megan's lyrics overflow with coquettish one-liners ('Sometimes I feel so out of control, when I step outside I need a drum roll,' runs new single 'Work It') and tongue-in-cheek self-deprecation ('Why the English Are Rubbish'). </p> <p>It's not hard to imagine the diminutive singer rummaging through the dressing-up box as a child. Her lyrics, sung in a breathy, girlish quaver, feature fairy-tale imagery, while the video to first single 'Pshandy' sees her tiptoeing round the forest as Little Red Riding Hood. This innocence is offset by her colleagues' giddy fuzzbomb of spiky guitars, chop-change rhythms and steel-sharp hooks, backed by choruses robust enough to sink a ship. </p> <p>Despite music bigwigs knocking at their door, the self-effacing quartet remain stoically independent. Megan's mum's garage is still their practice space. 'Kids from around here throw stones at the garage door,' says Megan, giggling. 'Some of them are scared of Jim because he chased them off with a drumstick.' </p> <p>The group's first singles came out on two indie labels - Marquis Cha Cha and Cool for Cats - and their eponymous album - recorded last summer in Halifax with Embrace's guitarist Richard McNamara - will be released on their own label Sindy Stroker's Records this month. With the likes of Glasvegas and Lily Allen already championing their infectious mega-pop (when Allen heard 'Shake It! Shake It!' on the radio she made them her top MySpace friend and they got 6,000 plays in a day), the city of Southampton finally has some homegrown talent to brag about.</p>",
  "<p>Anyone who owns an iPod knows the music business is an industry in transition. Revenues from CD sales are falling and profits from other sources, including downloads and touring, may be growing but are not yet large enough to replace them. The big record companies are undergoing a painful readjustment in response to harsh new economic realities but, like other creative industries, music has lost little of its glamour. Any business which has rich, talented and famous 'artists' sitting comfortably at its apex will continue to be alluring, and as long as we listen to music there will be money to be made from making and marketing it. OMM spoke to people working in every area of the business from office juniors to established musicians. Their accounts of how they live and work create a fascinating snapshot of the music business now. Although their roles and responsibilities vary hugely, a typical job advertisement - if one existed - might warn candidates that their days will begin and end at unusual times and they are likely to spend many months away from home. But it wouldn't need to sell the benefits of making a living out of a passion. Not everyone we spoke to was well paid - but the rewards are not always financial. The freedom to wear what you like and escape office life, meet your idols and create memories beyond price means most who work in the music business still regard it as a privilege. It may be an industry going through radical change, but it remains an industry like no other.</p> <h2>Rock photographer</h2> <p>When I began working for the weekly music press in the late 1980s, most photographers started by shooting live gigs. Modern digital photography means it's much harder to prove your talent that way; anyone can get lucky with a great live shot digitally, unlike portrait photography, where there's nowhere to hide. Retaining copyright is key. I did a shoot with a rock star just before he died, and was paid \u00a325,000 when they used my pics for a posthumous album (sadly, my agency took 50 per cent). Nowadays many publishers want to retain your copyright, and some magazines expect you to work for free.<br><strong>Pros</strong> Travel; capturing the classic shot<br><strong>Cons</strong> Giving up copyright; dealing with egos<br><strong>Salary</strong> \u00a3200-350 for a magazine shoot. Name photographers can charge tens of thousands a day</p> <h2>Drug dealer</h2> <p>I've been selling drugs since I was fifteen. I sell weed, but sometimes deal MDMA, ketamine or ecstasy, depending on what's available. I've helped organise music events for a while, and through that ended up selling to people in the industry. Bands spend a lot of time sat round bored, and usually have spare cash, so can be good customers. It's got me into great parties, and aftershows can be an easy setting to shift a load of gear. Managers are difficult by nature, so I try and deal direct to artists. I know a lot of the bands I deal to now. It's lucrative when I sell in bulk to a foreign act on tour. Obviously, the threat of prison isn't ideal, but it's not enough to make me quit the lifestyle.<br><strong>Pros</strong> Getting into aftershow parties<br><strong>Cons</strong> Threat of prison and irate managers<br><strong>Salary</strong> From \u00a350 to \u00a3500 a day</p> <h2>Radio DJ</h2> <p>I present a breakfast show for two hours a day, five days a week, for a big national station. I do two or three hours preparation at home the day before each show, plus an hour's prep before the show and an hour or two after. That might be making packages, finding audio clips or making remixes. When you're on air, concentration has to be very high. Pluggers call all the time asking to meet up or inviting you to gigs which might encourage you to play their music. I only get to one or two a week because of my hours. It's not working a production line, it's telling listeners what's going on and playing the best music so they can go to work with a smile on their face. <br><strong>Pros</strong> Meeting your idols<br><strong>Cons</strong> Irregular working hours<br><strong>Salary</strong> \u00a350,000-\u00a3100,000 PA on big network, depending on experience.</p> <h2>Stylist</h2> <p>My job is mainly shopping and dressing pop stars - organising personal wardrobes, styling tours and dressing them for public appearances. Prep days can be 9am-7pm shopping, and shoot days can be from 6am till midnight. I enjoy the money, travelling, and occasional recognition for doing a good job. Sometimes I think what I do is important, other times I feel like a glorified shopper. It can be a nightmare blagging things for an artist who isn't well known. Working with terrible bands, just for money, is soul-sapping. Everyone has an opinion on how they should look. Having my outfits slated in Heat isn't much fun, either.<br><strong>Pros</strong> Money; travelling; free clothes<br><strong>Cons</strong> Long hours; dealing with egos<br><strong>Salary</strong> From \u00a3400 for prep day to \u00a3800 for full work day; Ad work can pay up to \u00a31,500 a day</p> <h2>Band member</h2> <p>I joined a well-known rock band four months ago, on keyboards and backing vocals. They've been around for a while so we play some big festivals. I can't describe what it feels like to go on stage in front of thousands. That's when you think, 'This is what I signed up for.' The pay's getting better as there's never been a more important time to play live, and that's where the money is. But while it's better than a regular job, you soundcheck then spend all day sitting around. It's the boredom that makes people turn to drugs. Sometimes you get sick of fans asking you to sign things, but everyone likes a bit of attention now and again. <br><strong>Pros</strong> Playing to big crowds; adulation; money<br><strong>Cons</strong> Lots of hanging around<br><strong>Salary</strong> \u00a3200-\u00a3500 a day depending on size and success of the band</p> <h2>Website editor</h2> <p>When I was 10 it seemed impossible I'd have a successful career just for liking pop music. Now I come into the office every day to a pile of CDs. I get in as early as 6.30am, but it's still enjoyable. You have to decide what the parameters are. It may not be worth writing about something that's already been covered widely. Pop is about three minutes of music, and there may be as much to say about a CD sleeve as a live performance. There are things that irritate me - if you're a newspaper journalist, Madonna's people will be on the phone negotiating a cover story, but as a website editor they'll ask you to post a link to the video three weeks after it's out. I don't want to be seen as part of the promotional process.<br><strong>Pros</strong> Total DIY freedom; ideal for egotists<br><strong>Cons</strong> No time off; very competitive<br><strong>Salary</strong> 100,000 readers will make you \u00a330K</p> <h2>Tour manager</h2> <p>A typical tour manager will be on the road for eight or nine months a year, working three shows then a day off. I'm up at 8.30am and in bed by 1am, then travel overnight on the tour bus. There's a huge amount of preparation. The tour I'm on now started in May, but I've been planning it since January. You've got to talk to the agents and promoters, and on a big tour you have a crew of 100, so that's 10 buses plus all the hotels to book. The worst thing is a flight being delayed or cancelled. There are very few prima donnas these days and the venues are more organised. If they have everything you need the day runs much more smoothly.<br><strong>Pros</strong> Travel; nabbing the best hotel rooms<br><strong>Cons</strong> Being away from home<br><strong>Salary</strong> \u00a35,000-\u00a36,000 a month for a four-month tour</p> <h2>Office junior</h2> <p>As office junior at a major label, my job involves a lot of admin; booking travel, the odd bit of regional press for bands on tour; trying to get people down to gigs and making sure everyone in the press office is OK. I'm the first point of contact for everyone that phones in and generally journalists are pretty polite because they want something. Some weeks it's very chilled out, some weeks it's incredibly hectic - especially when we've got a big record coming out. The job itself isn't glamorous but the perks can be; occasionally I see pop stars in the building, I get to go to lots of gigs and meet new people over lunch. A normal day is from 10am-6pm. I can wear what I want and listen to the radio. <br><strong>Pros</strong> Social life; meeting pop stars<br><strong>Cons</strong> Can be dull; not that well paid<br><strong>Salary</strong> Under \u00a320,000 per annum</p> <h2>Music journalist</h2> <p>I started reviewing gigs and albums for my university magazine, which didn't pay, but was great experience and I got into gigs for free. I then did odd bit for a weekly magazine, but at first I had to work behind a bar to supplement my income. Journalism in general is very competitive, music journalism even more so. There are great perks, like being flown to America to interview one of your favourite bands, but those trips are not nearly so frequent as they used to be. They say never meet your idols, but I still enjoy interviewing bands. Just don't expect them to be your new best friend.<br><strong>Pros</strong> Getting a private audience with your favourite band; travel; free CDs<br><strong>Cons</strong> Very competitive; generally underpaid<br><strong>Salary</strong> From \u00a315,000-\u00a370,000</p> <h2>Head of press</h2> <p>A friend at a major record company got me a job writing sleeve notes and press releases on seven grand a year in the mid-Eighties, and I worked my way up. I run a department of four press officers and two assistants. It's about establishing great relationships with journalists, through lunches and gigs. The job's changed out of financial necessity. We can't fly people business class halfway round the world to review a band, which used to be de rigueur. I experienced the boom years and we had a brilliant time. Now I feel like I'm presiding over the last days of Rome, but it beats working in a bank.<br><strong>Pros</strong> Flexible hours, and the (sadly shrinking) expense account<br><strong>Cons</strong> Working at the fin de si\u00e9cle<br><strong>Salary</strong> \u00a350,000-\u00a375,000</p> <h2>Music plugger</h2> <p>My job is to get a track played on the radio for my clients. If you've got a new Arctic Monkeys track it's more of a management role. With smaller bands it's about telling DJs and producers about the artist and listening out for similar tracks being played. I only take on records I believe in and I drop in to see DJs and producers every week. Radio 1 is still very powerful. You won't get a hit without them, and commercial stations take their lead from them. You're competing for very few slots, but Radio 1 will take risks and play unknown artists; which commercial stations can't do. Radio 1's playlist is published on the BBC website every Wednesday at 5.15pm and most of the industry will be waiting for it. <br><strong>Pros</strong> Hanging out with musicians and DJs<br><strong>Cons</strong> Giving up on a track you love<br><strong>Salary</strong> Between \u00a35,000 and \u00a36,000 a month</p> <h2>Independent PR</h2> <p>Twenty years ago no one knew what a PR was. Now every act has some form of PR. They're aren't many big PR players working for companies any more, they've all gone freelance. The PR's role has changed a lot. It used to be more about simply getting publicity for your act, but now it can be more about managing publicity, as over-exposure can be as bad as under-exposure. Twenty years ago you only had certain publications, but they were selling huge amounts. Now everyone is writing about music. The key to a PR is building up your contacts and that takes years of mutual trust. <br><strong>Pros</strong> Planning a big campaign is a great buzz<br><strong>Cons</strong> Keeping errant stars out of the press<br><strong>Salary</strong> From \u00a325,000 to more than \u00a3100,000 if you have high-profile clients</p> <h2>Guitar tech</h2> <p>I started as a guitar tech by being in bands myself and knowing other crew members. I mainly work with one band who have been touring a lot recently, and supplement that by stints with others when they take a break. I set up and pack down the guitarist's equipment at every gig, and am on hand for his technical assistance during the show. I usually get a day rate, which differs greatly depending on the scale of the tour. I've been to some amazing places like Japan, Australia and America. The partying side is a lot of fun, too, but tiring. I also enjoy the flexibility. You get decent time off, so I can still pursue my own musical projects when I'm not on tour. <br><strong>Pros</strong> Travel; great parties; flexibility<br><strong>Cons</strong> Very tiring; no security<br><strong>Salary</strong> From free beer to \u00a3250 a day</p> <h2>Venue manager</h2> <p>As general manager of a mid-sized venue, I basically run the building, dealing with the local council and police, and a fair few egos. I handle bookings, promoters and customer complaints. Mainstream promoters tend to do everything by the book, but a lot of small indie promoters don't know what they're doing. There are always issues to deal with - someone OD-ing, crowds trying to rush the door, even the occasional injury or death. Plus some little star who's not on the guest list and has a tantrum. At bigger venues a manager can work 60 hours a week, including weekends. Some do 700 shows a year. People think it's glamorous but a lot of it is pretty mundane. <br><strong>Pros</strong> Getting on the guest list at other venues<br><strong>Cons</strong> Getting guest list hassle at your venue<br><strong>Salary</strong> Between \u00a335,000 and \u00a350,000</p> <h2>Lighting engineer</h2> <p>I was selling T-shirts for a big indie band, then one night they needed someone to do the lights. I've been doing it for four years now and I've got my own business, sending people out on tours I can't do. A lot of engineers go to college, but I learnt on the job. On tour I'm the first up, at 8.30am, and last to bed, around 1am, because lights are the last thing down. Last year I toured with a mid-sized band and did 157 gigs in a year and 32 festivals in three months. We were up at 5am to get to the airport, going to bed at 3am, then doing it all over again. It almost killed us. I've been to Japan four times and America 10 times, but on a day off you just want to sleep. <br><strong>Pros</strong> Plenty of travel; great social life<br><strong>Cons</strong> Being electrocuted<br><strong>Salary</strong> \u00a3100-\u00a3200 a day, plus five-figure bonus at the end of big tours</p> <h2>Promoter</h2> <p>I got into promoting by suggesting bands to the venue where I was DJing, and I ended up booking bands for them. Eventually I was headhunted by a national promoter. Day to day, I speak to venues, agents and record labels, not just about my bands and gigs but also to find out about which new bands everyone is talking about and how other tours are selling. Ideally, I will find an unsigned band and build them up to playing big national tours. But you don't have a contract with the bands, so there's always the danger they could decide to go with another promoter. There is some poaching, but there's an unwritten rule that you won't go after other promoters' bands.<br><strong>Pros</strong> Building a band from nothing <br><strong>Cons</strong> Losing a successful band<br><strong>Salary</strong> \u00a330K-50K basic</p>",
  "<p>People keep asking me when I think we will get sick of stories about the credit crunch and falling house prices. I don't know, but the scary headlines on property and personal debt have certainly been crowding out other issues, such as the parlous state of company pensions. I'm sorry this is not light relief, but the crisis in final-salary funds is likely to be deeper and longer-lasting than the credit crunch, and it deserves thinking about.</p> <p>The annual survey of FTSE 100 companies by actuary Lane Clark &amp; Peacock paints an alarming picture. Funds which appeared to be enjoying a collective surplus of \u00a312bn last summer have swung into the red to the tune of \u00a341bn, measured by current accounting standards, as falling stock markets, rising inflation and rising life expectancies have increased their exposure. </p> <p>The realistic underlying situation may be much worse. For technical reasons I won't bore you with here, a rise in high-grade corporate bond yields allows companies to report lower pension liabilities. The credit crunch has pushed yields up, with highly flattering effects on fund exposures: if yields had stayed the same as last year, the deficit would be more than \u00a380bn, according to LCP (see chart).</p> <p>Pension funds are also having to find the money to pay their members for longer. Methuselahs are bad news for employers, as each extra year pensioners are expected to live adds \u00a311bn to liabilities across the FTSE 100 index. </p> <p>Despite all this, crunched companies have not done much to reduce their pension risks by ploughing more into funds - in fact, contributions fell from \u00a313.4bn to \u00a313.1bn. Some are pledging non-cash assets instead - British Airways, for instance, has offered a letter of credit secured on planes - and the use of this kind of IOU is expected to increase. </p> <p>Where does this leave us? The most heavily exposed companies (see table) have pension funds like large circus elephants balanced precariously atop a tiny ball - the business itself. The buyout market (see chart), which enables firms to pass on their liabilities to a third party, usually an insurer, has ballooned, with Lonmin and Friends Provident in the vanguard for the FTSE. We can expect to see much more of this in future, as and when companies can afford to offload their funds. A buyout by an insurer may be a good solution for members if it offers greater security than a weak employer, but the risk is that pensioners are caught up in a game of pass the parcel, with responsibility for their security in retirement becoming ever more remote from the former employer they thought they were relying on. </p> <p>We can expect to see greater conflict between shareholders, on the one hand, and pension fund trustees and members on the other. Both will want to stake their claim on a company's cash. At the moment, notwithstanding the huge pensions liabilities, the investors are winning. LCP notes that of the 59 FTSE schemes with a deficit, 46 had a shortfall less than or equal to the dividends paid out during 2007. Members may well want to know the reason why, though this issue is complicated by the fact that a cut in divis would hurt the financial position of - you've guessed it - pension funds.</p> <p>We should expect to see more final salary scheme closures: more than half of the companies in the FTSE 100 disclosed that they have shut the doors of their funds to new employees, and only five said they had one still open to recruits. It is likely that there will be more claims on the Pension Protection Fund too, if the credit crunch pushes more firms into insolvency. </p> <p>There are no easy solutions to this. Companies find themselves with final-salary commitments they are woefully ill-equipped to meet, and not all of this is their own fault. Many took contribution holidays during the good years, but they were encouraged to do this by legislation that taxed surpluses above a certain level. Other factors, such as longevity, are out of their control. Accounting standards are flawed, but these are real liabilities that companies will have to meet for decades to come.</p> <p>The government has, despite its efforts to improve security for scheme members, played a poor hand. Gordon Brown's abolition of tax credits on dividends received by funds has raised an estimated \u00a35bn a year for the Treasury, but has weakened schemes and encouraged firms to shut them down.</p> <p>The shameful evasion of responsibility for Equitable Life victims has discouraged people from making provision through personal plans. The lack of faith in pensions, coupled with the easy credit that powered the housing boom, induced far too many people to rely on their now dwindling property assets to fund their retirement - and so we come full circle. </p> <p>It's not just credit that should be worrying us - we should also be scared of the pensions crunch.</p> <h2>Ofcom must see ITV's big picture</h2> <p>Protests from chief executives that their businesses are being throttled by regulation are usually to be taken with a liberal pinch of salt, but ITV's boss Michael Grade, pictured below, has a point. If there were a watchdog called, let's see, Ofhack, which regulated newspapers in the same way Ofcom does ITV, it would mean editors would be told how many ads they could run and where on the pages they had to go; and the rate they could charge would be set by a regulator. </p> <p>The problem is that the regulatory regime is locked into assumptions of past competitive advantage when ITV is struggling to face a more challenging future. Since it was created through the merger of Carlton and Granada in 2002/3, its share of the ad market has dropped from half to 40 per cent; the number of rival channels has grown to more than 200 and digital penetration has more than doubled to 90 per cent. Yet the broadcaster is hobbled by regulations that, for instance, left it unable to show any ads in the second half of a two-hour episode of Lewis watched by 10 million people, because its quota of advertising minutes had run out.</p> <p>ITV ought to be allowed to make its own commercial decisions on advertising and its spending on regional news; it would, after all, have to live with the consequences. If it were to cut back too far on regional output, that would damage its own brand and identity; the viewers would get fed up and switch over. Similarly, if it were to swamp programmes with ads, the viewers would get fed up and switch over. But if the regulators don't lighten the load, Grade's chances of turning the company around are much slimmer. There is too much interference on the ITV screen.</p>",
  "<p>Alistair Darling may officially have been the boss last week while Gordon Brown was dodging the showers in Southwold, but the Chancellor spent much of his time grappling with bright ideas for kick-starting a rapid economic renaissance - ideas that seemed to be emanating from everywhere but the Treasury, where officials wearily stressed there was 'no master plan'.</p> <p>Twelve months into the credit crunch, the news from Britain's economy is deteriorating almost by the day. House prices slipped by another 1.7 per cent in July, according to the Halifax, and are now down 9 per cent from their peak; consumers are beginning to trim their spending to match eye-watering rises in fuel bills and mortgage repayments; and the Bank of England is too alarmed by the fear of rocketing inflation to give them a break by cutting interest rates.</p> <p>A housing market 'correction', as economists call it, may have been long overdue, but the shortage of supply of mortgages has made the slide alarmingly fast - and Darling is anxious about the collateral damage for the wider economy, as the construction sector collapses and depressed homeowners cut back on spending.</p> <p>Pressure on Darling is now intense to convince voters he's on their side and yet come up with measures that are affordable within the government's tight budget. Here, we look at some of the proposals; and, right, Tory shadow Chief Secretary Philip Hammond and Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Vince Cable give their own prescriptions. </p> <p><strong>A stamp duty holiday</strong></p> <p>Some or all homebuyers could be excused from paying stamp duty for a limited period. The Conservatives tried this from 1991-92. It did give the ailing housing market a temporary shot of adrenaline - conveniently, in time for the 1992 election - but once stamp duty was brought back, the downturn re-emerged with a vengeance. A Treasury analysis of the 1991 decision, released under Freedom of Information rules, said: 'Once stamp duty was reimposed, the number of transactions collapsed and prices fell sharply... The announcement of these large house price falls further discouraged potential buyers: so the stamp duty holiday, which had been intended to bring forward a recovery in the housing market, ended up further undermining the confidence that was essential to recovery.' </p> <p>It was 1995 by the time the housing market began to bounce back.</p> <p>There's also a risk of encouraging hard-pressed buyers into the market, only for them to watch the value of their home slide. 'The housing market's got to become more affordable: surely, letting prices go is the solution,' says Karen Ward, chief UK economist at HSBC. And suspending stamp duty is not cheap either: the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) reckons a holiday for properties worth up to \u00a3250,000 for a year would cost around \u00a33bn.</p> <p><strong>A special tax-free savings scheme for first-time buyers </strong></p> <p>With many banks demanding larger deposits as they rein in lending, this has been mooted by the Treasury as a way of helping frustrated house-hunters get enough cash together.</p> <p>The problem with this idea is that there is no way within the tax system of working out whether a particular saver is a first-time buyer. But if the scheme is made available to everyone, it would end up being costly. </p> <p>'Everybody would just pile money into it,' says Bill Dodwell, head of tax policy at accountants Deloitte and Touche. Increasing the total Isa allowance by just \u00a3200 a year, as announced in last year's Budget, cost Gordon Brown \u00a350m, but it would take much more than a few hundred pounds to boost first-time buyers' hopes of saving a deposit.</p> <p><strong>A windfall tax on the major utilities companies</strong></p> <p>This proposal was seized upon by the government last week and is favoured by trade unions and Labour backbenchers concerned at steep rises in constituents' fuel bills. The cash could be earmarked for anti-fuel-poverty measures, and such a move could win popular support among voters who feel the energy firms have profited at householders' expense.</p> <p>If a windfall tax is convincingly presented as a one-off measure, it should have little impact on the long-term investment plans of the companies in question. However, Robert Chote, director of tax think-tank the IFS, says winning that argument might be tricky in these straitened fiscal times. </p> <p>'The classic concern with a windfall tax is: if you have one coming along, do people fear that there will be another one coming along later? If you create the impression that this is a government in trouble, and scrabbling for whatever income it can get, it could be hard to persuade people that either this industry or another industry will not be subject to such a tax in future.'</p> <p><strong>Order the Bank of England into line</strong></p> <p>Bank governor Mervyn King and some of his colleagues on its monetary policy committee (MPC) are extremely concerned about the threat of higher inflation, which they believe gives them little leeway to cut rates - and could even be used as an argument to raise them. Bank independence is viewed as a great achievement of New Labour; but as the bottom falls out of the housing market, pressure could increase for Darling to remind King of his responsibility to support the government's policies, as well as keep inflation under control. </p> <p>Some economists, including the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club's Peter Spencer, also argue that the MPC's remit should be rewritten. However, this would be a gamble with extremely high stakes: central banks live by their reputations, and the markets could punish sterling, and the gilts the government uses to fund its borrowing, if investors lost confidence in the government's determination to control inflation. </p> <p><strong>Absolutely nothing</strong></p> <p>Not a great vote-winner, but business groups say masterly inactivity could actually be the best policy. 'We're not looking for lollipops,' says the Institute of Directors' head of tax, Richard Baron. 'We want to tell Alistair Darling, \"Calm down, dear! Don't jerk your knee at anything.\"'</p> <p>HSBC's Karen Ward says a raft of costly measures - which will eventually have to be paid for through taxation - could undermine investor confidence. 'At the end of the day, there's a consequence for the future. The real danger is that people look at the UK and start to question whether it's a good investment prospect: that's the real risk.'</p>",

The kitchen is particularly well-equipped, making this an ideal choice for a stylish house party, and its location - four miles from the nearest main road - guarantees privacy. There are walks from the front door, red kites wheeling in the sky above and stunning views along the valley. Sleeps seven.<br><strong> Book it:</strong> Three-night breaks from \u00a3355 (01874 676446; <a href=\"http://www.breconcottages.com\">www.breconcottages.com</a>)</p> <p><strong>8. ROPEHAWN, TRENARREN, CORNWALL</strong></p> <p>Accessible only by boat or down a steep 200m path from the nearest road, Ropehawn is a former fisherman's house, and the sunken garden was originally a salt cellar used for salting the day's catch. Although just two miles south of St Austell, it feels totally secluded; the house is swamped by gorgeous views across St Austell Bay and there is not another property in sight. There is good swimming right outside the walls and a private rocky beach is revealed at low tide. There is a rowing boat for exploring on the water and a deep mooring for those who wish to bring their own boat. Sleeps nine.<br><strong>BOOK IT:</strong> A week from \u00a3367 through Helpful Holidays as before</p> <p><strong>9. THE COLONSAY HOTEL, COLONSAY, SCOTLAND</strong></p> <p>The Colonsay - on the island of the same name - has an elegant, contemporary feel, with just nine bedrooms. The ferry crossing from Oban takes just over two hours, transporting you to a world of glistening empty beaches, dramatic lochs and cliffs and a world where seals, goats and sheep outnumber people. Amid such isolation, the comforts of the Colonsay seem even more remarkable: a top-notch but informal restaurant serving locally sourced seafood and organic produce, fire-lit lounges with painted floorboards and deep sofas for winter and view-strewn terraces for summer, with an extensive wine and whisky list. <br><strong> BOOK IT:</strong> Doubles from \u00a3140, dinner, bed and breakfast (01951 200316; <a href=\"http://www.thecolonsay.com\">www.thecolonsay.com</a>)</p> <p><strong>10. DOLSERAU HALL, DOLGELLAU, WALES</strong></p> <p>Built as a country house retreat for a wealthy family in the 19th century, Dolserau lies half a mile down a private driveway and is surrounded by meadows and the lush River Wnion valley. Egyptian linen, Molton Brown toiletries and unbroken views from every window make the rooms feel nicely indulgent, while dinners of local game, fish and cheeses are the perfect finale to an afternoon spent stomping through the countryside. The hotel sits in five acres of grounds in the Snowdonia National Park, meaning all sorts of activities, from fishing to whitewater rafting, are on the doorstep.<br><strong> Book it:</strong> Doubles from \u00a3122, B&amp;B (01341 422522; <a href=\"http://www.dolserau.co.uk\">www.dolserau.co.uk</a>)</p> <h2>BACK TO BASICS</h2> <p><strong>11. MEANACH BOTHY, SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS</strong></p> <p>Accommodation doesn't get more basic, but staggering views and a sense of glorious isolation, make this rough stone-walled hut a more memorable place to stay than any of the world's finest hotels. It sits alone beside a little river in a flat meadow, at the edges of which dramatic peaks rear up on every side. To get there, you have to walk about seven miles east from the point where the road ends in Glen Nevis. There's nothing there: you bring your own sleeping bags and firewood, draw water from the stream and take your rubbish away with you. </p> <p>Meanach is one of more than 100 mountain bothies in Britain - small huts that are left open for anyone hiking in the hills to make use of. The Mountain Bothy Association is a group of volunteers who maintain the bothies, although the buildings themselves still belong to the local landowners. Finding bothies can be tricky - the MBA does not publish their location for fear of vandals rocking up for wild all-night summer parties - but hiking guidebooks and websites will lead you to them.<br><strong>Book it:</strong> Just turn up .

PENRHYN COTTAGE, PEMBROKESHIRE, WALES</strong></p> <p>Squirrelled away down a rugged track that passes through stunning National Trust land, Penrhyn cottage on the dramatic Strumble Head peninsula has no electricity (lamps and candles have to suffice) but instead offers some mesmerising views of the cliff-dominated landscape and the vast sea that lies beyond it. The traditional split-level stone cottage is very cosily furnished and handily located for the Pembrokeshire Coastal Path, where the waymarked paths give plenty of possibilities of seeing seals and porpoises. Although the cottage does feel miles from anywhere, the pretty town of Fishguard is only five miles away. Sleeps six.<br><strong>Book it: </strong>A week costs from \u00a3333 with Coastal Cottages of Pembrokeshire (01437 765765; <a href=\"http://www.coastalcottages.co.uk\">www.coastalcottages.co.uk</a>)</p> <p><strong>13. PURTON GREEN, SUFFOLK</strong></p> <p>Landmark Trust properties may be simply furnished, but what they lack in modern luxuries they tend to make up for in scenic locations. A wheelbarrow is provided at Purton Green for you to transport your luggage the 400m from where cars have to be left. This stunning medieval property has a central hall that dates from 1250, though what is now the main living quarters was rebuilt in around 1600. The cottage is the sole remaining house of a 'lost village' - one of many in Suffolk that were once small thriving communities but no longer exist - and is surrounded by open fields. Sleeps four.<br><strong> Book it:</strong> A week costs from \u00a3434 through the Landmark Trust (01628 825925; <a href=\"http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk\">www.landmarktrust.org.uk</a>)</p> <p><strong>14. BLACK SAIL YOUTH HOSTEL, ENNERDALE, CUMBRIA</strong></p> <p>England's most remote youth hostel is well known: a simple shepherd's bothy at the head of Ennerdale that offers great walking on the surrounding fells including Great Gable, Red Pike and Steeple. Facilities are basic - there are no double or twin rooms, just two sleeping four people, and one dormitory that sleeps eight. However, there is a restaurant that offers evening meals along with a surprisingly good organic wine list, and good self-catering facilities.<br><strong>Book it:</strong> From \u00a313.95 a night, through YHA (01629 592700; <a href=\"http://www.yha.org.uk\">www.yha.org.uk</a>)</p> <p><strong>15. TYNCORNEL BUNKHOUSE, CEREDIGION, WALES</strong></p> <p>Although electricity was recently installed at this youth hostel, there is little else to distract from the feeling of being surrounded by nature. The Bunkhouse is a mile from the nearest house and the nearest pubs and shops are at Llanddewi Brefi, almost seven miles away. Tyncornel is birdwatching heaven, with red kites, buzzards and ravens all easily spottable, and the house makes a great base for walking and cycling around the remote countryside. There are two rooms with eight beds, camping facilities and a dining room and self-catering facilities.<br><strong>Book it:</strong> From \u00a310 a night through YHA, as before.</p> <h2>ROMANTIC ISOLATION</h2> <p><strong>16. THE TEMPLE, BADGER, SHROPSHIRE</strong></p> <p>This absolute gem is hidden away in the heart of the Shropshire countryside - an 18th-century folly built in the grounds of a manor house that, sadly, no longer exists. The Temple, which was built to classical proportions with a colonnaded balcony and an elegant sitting room on the ground floor, where tea parties would have been taken, has been creatively restored, with a period feel very much in mind. In addition to a fully fitted kitchen and modern bathroom there is a very cosy double bedroom below. The balcony was designed to make the best of the stunning and unbroken views of more than 40 acres of countryside. After spending the morning enjoying the scenery, you can pack your lunch, pull on your wellies and ramble off into the undisturbed woodland straight from the front door. Sleeps two.<br><strong>Book it:</strong> From \u00a3350 for a three-night, midweek break, through the Vivat Trust (0845 0900194; <a href=\"http://www.vivat.org.uk\">www.vivat.org.uk</a>)</p> <p><strong>17. MOOR OF RANNOCH HOTEL, PERTHSHIRE, SCOTLAND</strong></p> <p>If you're driving to this hotel make sure you have plenty of fuel: the nearest garage is 38 miles away. In the heart of Rannoch Moor, one of the most spectacular wildernesses in the UK, the hotel lies 16 miles from the nearest town, Kinloch Rannoch, although a tiny railway station is just a minute's walk. Ideal for escaping from everything and just spending time with a partner, there are walks of every level from the front door, but the real joy is curling up in front of a roaring log fire and enjoying the slap-up suppers of locally reared meats.<br><strong>Book it:</strong> Doubles \u00a380 including breakfast (01882 633238; <a href=\"http://www.moorofrannoch.co.uk\">www.moorofrannoch.co.uk</a>)</p> <p><strong>18. BARDSEY ISLAND, NORTH WALES</strong></p> <p>Steeped in mythology and religious history, Bardsey, two miles off the Llyn peninsula, feels as though it has remained unchanged for centuries. There are houses to rent that rely on candles and gas and have outside chemical toilets. The island itself is magical; home to artists and new-agers lured by the wild landscapes, ancient ruins and burial sites that are scattered across the hills.<br><strong>Book it:</strong> A cottage for two costs from \u00a3185 per week (08458 112233; <a href=\"http://www.bardsey.org\">www.bardsey.org</a>)</p> <p><strong>19. CUTTHORNE, EXMOOR </strong></p> <p>Cutthorne is a Georgian farmhouse at the heart of a 25-acre estate, in its own private valley on Exmoor. There are three rooms in the main house offering B&amp;B and dinners, and two cottages, each sleeping up to four, whose residents can also take meals in the main house. Two miles from the nearest village, the house has its own trout lake, and fabulous walks all around. Food is an important part of a stay: slap-up breakfasts of local meats and seasonal fruits, and packed lunches.<br><strong>Book it:</strong> Doubles from \u00a338 B&amp;B (01643 831255; <a href=\"http://www.cutthorne.com\">www.cutthorne.com</a>)</p> <p><strong>20. KALE POT COTTAGE, NORTH YORKSHIRE</strong></p> <p>Few things are more romantic than staring up at a starlit sky, and Kale Pot - a converted 18th-century barn tucked down a tiny road on the North York Moors - has nothing else near it to spoil the view. There are miles of forestry tracks starting from the door of the cottage, but it's tempting to just crack open a bottle, fire up the barbecue and let complete silence wash over you. The only neighbours are roe deer.<br><strong>Book it:</strong> From \u00a3275 a week, sleeps four (01751 476654; <a href=\"http://www.northyorkmoorscottage.co.uk\">www.northyorkmoorscottage.co.uk</a>)</p> <h2>BRITAIN'S MOST REMOTE...

  "<p>It is approximately 10 minutes after first meeting Larissa that she asks me to bend over so she can 'reach my bottom crease'. I am standing in a small cubicle, naked save for a flimsy paper G-string, and Larissa looks at me intently, with a vaguely critical crinkle between her eyes. Dressed entirely in black, she holds what looks like an aerosol can, menacingly connected to a vast metallic cylinder with various gauges and dials on the side. </p> <p>There are some people, no doubt, who would pay a premium for this sort of thing if it were taking place in an insalubrious Soho basement. I, however, am in a very posh salon in central London, the air thick with the scent of potted orchids and nail varnish remover. My encounter with the hand-held crop fertiliser is a completely normal part of a modern beauty regime and costs a mere \u00a330 a pop. This is how to get a tan, 21st-century style.</p> <p>Within eight hours, Larissa tells me, the sticky, sweaty sensation will have evaporated and I will emerge with the sort of olive-skinned glow that bespeaks lengthy summer holidays in Barbados, being served oysters by liveried deckhands on board Jodie Kidd's yacht. I will be gloriously honey-hued. I will have achieved the quintessential complexion du jour of brown face, eerily white teeth and strange tea-stained patches around my knees. I, too, will have a fake tan.</p> <p>Britons now spend around \u00a341m a year on self-tanning products, a figure that has grown fivefold since the late Nineties. </p> <p>Globally, self-tan sales are worth around $675m (\u00a3340m) and sun care is the fastest growing sector of the international cosmetics market, routinely outperforming other emerging areas such as male grooming and baby toiletries. Sales of self-tanning products are up 51 per cent at John Lewis this year, and over four weeks last August Superdrug sold 1.4m bottles of fake tan, an increase of 50 per cent that was attributed to unseasonably bad weather. This summer, the International Therapy Education Council has even launched an official diploma in tanning treatments.</p> <p>'Tanning has been elevated to a national pastime in the UK, especially in the north of England and Scotland,' says Wendy Lewis, a beauty consultant and the author of Plastic Makes Perfect. 'Once you get used to looking tanned or dark and bronzed, you are afraid to go back to looking pasty and white. The trend used to be restricted to holiday season during the summer, but now it is year round.' A tan, she says, is seen as an accessory: 'Users feel younger, it covers flaws and imperfections like thread veins, spots, scars and blotches, and younger women say it makes them look skinnier.'</p> <p>Faking it also carries more serious health benefits: more than 2,300 people die from skin cancer each year in the UK - a 20-fold increase over the past decade and a death rate higher than Australia's, where the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays are far stronger. As the incidence of skin cancer rocketed through the Eighties and Nineties, there was a heightened awareness of the dangers of sun exposure, and fake tan, applied out of a bottle, was endorsed by the British Skin Foundation as a healthy alternative. </p> <p>While this might explain why consumers started to use self-tanning products, the increase in sales has been so huge that there are other factors at work, too. A lot of it comes down to an aspirational desire to emulate celebrities: having a tan is seen as the ultimate signifier of luxury, wealth, style and a bank balance big enough to fund perpetual holidays.</p> <p>'If they look like they just stepped off a plane from Martinique, everyone is envious,' says Geordie Grieg, editor of society magazine Tatler. 'It's not what you do but the way you do it. It is a question of getting good products, good advice and not overdoing it. Anything can be sophisticated, any cosmetic addition, if it's not obvious. Subtlety is the watchword.'</p> <p>Fake tan has spread itself so insidiously across the nation's epidermis that this year's organisers of Royal Ascot found it necessary to ban racegoers who displayed streaky orange marks. Last month, fake-tanning reached such epidemic levels at Baines High School in Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancashire, that the headmistress wrote to parents asking them to ensure that pupils 'do not come to school looking varying shades of orange'. In Scotland, where spotting a ray of tan-worthy sunshine is almost as rare as a sighting of the Loch Ness Monster, schoolchildren in East Dunbartonshire have been offered lessons in how to apply fake tan after teachers noticed pupils popping out for sunbed sessions in their lunch hour.</p> <p>'We always recommend that it's best to look as natural as possible and not to wear too much fake tan,' says Jo Bryant, an etiquette adviser for Debrett's. 'It isn't the best look to be overly permatanned but it would equally be incredibly rude for anyone to comment on it. It should be worn like make-up: sparingly, in order to enhance the features that are already there.' </p> <p>There is a staggering array of lotions on offer: anti-ageing tans, moisturising tans or tans that promise almost everything apart from getting up in the morning and buttering your toast. The technological advances are such that getting brown the ordinary way has become an ancient anthropological curiosity, to be filed alongside dodo feathers in some dusty recess of the British Museum. My own spray-tan, the 'BeautyLab peptide', promised to firm <br>my skin with sea algae and leave me softly fragranced with 'a hint of guava and melon'.</p> <p>The next day, I wake up the colour of an Ikea beech dining table. It is, I have to say, not unattractive. The tan is subtle, natural-looking and when I go to a friend's wedding with bare legs, no one points at me and laughs. I feel rather glamorous and jet-set, an impression only slightly undermined by the fact that I smell like a cross between a crispy duck pancake and a chemically enhanced digestive biscuit. When I get home, I see that my sheets are besmirched by unspeakable brown streaks and the neckline of my dress looks like it has been worn by hordes of unwashed schoolboys. After three days, I'm back to my normal British pastiness. Why, I wonder, does anyone bother?</p> <p>'It just gives me a good feeling,' says Leanne, 23, a part-time hairdresser with peroxide-blonde hair and a freshly minted all-over tan. 'I used to go on sunbeds all the time but I stopped because I kept seeing those makeover shows on TV where they said it was really bad for your skin. So now I come in every week to get a spray tan, just to keep it topped up.'</p> <p>Leanne is at The Tanning Shop, a small, glass-fronted building sandwiched between video shops and fried chicken takeaways in a smoggy corner of south west London. It is emblazoned with bright blue signs offering UV tanning from 69p a minute, alongside professional teeth-whitening services and something called 'hot stone' treatment.</p> <p>Leanne has been fake tanning for at least two years. Can she remember her natural colour? 'Yeah, I was very fair skinned and it just looked really unhealthy. A tan makes you look better and slimmer. It means you can wear short skirts and not worry that your legs look white. I'd say I was addicted to tanning.' She laughs. 'My friends call me the original tanorexic.'</p> <p>Leanne is one of a growing number of young women who, spurred on by the year-round tan of their favourite stars, spend much of their time and their money attempting to create a similar effect. Today's celebrities are required to sport deep brown tans in much the same way as they are obliged to buy very small yappy dogs and carry them round in their handbags. Victoria Beckham had a St Tropez airbrush tanning booth installed at Beckingham Palace, and the only famous people who get away with looking pale tend to be flame-haired supermodels or politicians forced to holiday in the UK because of the credit crunch.</p> <p>Chantelle Houghton, the former Celebrity Big Brother contestant, garnered some column inches earlier this year when she admitted she was addicted to spray tans. 'It keeps going deeper and deeper,' she said, apparently surprised by this turn of events. In 2005, a group of dermatologists published a study that showed frequent tanners who experience a loss of control over their tanning schedule display a similar pattern of addiction to smokers and alcoholics denied their daily fix.</p> <p>In spray-tan devotees like Leanne or Chantelle, this carries few undesirable side-effects, other than looking like a glamour model dipped in Ronseal. Much better than that old tan alternative, the sunbed, the results of which can be fatal. Last July, Zita Farrelly, a 29-year-old mother of two from Salford, who had been using tanning beds since she was 14, died of skin cancer. According to the World Health Organisation, regular use can result in acute and chronic health effects on the skin and eye, including premature ageing, malignant melanoma and cataracts.</p> <p>'Fake tan is entirely safe,' says Julie McManus, a senior scientific adviser for L'Or\u00e9al. 'The active ingredient, Dihydroxyacetone [DHA], is an amino acid that reacts with the upper surface of your skin - the dead skin cells - to get a change in colour. It is a three-carbon sugar originally used to treat diabetes. The molecule is too big to penetrate any deeper into the skin.'</p> <p>The chemical reaction produces a brown pigment called melanoidin and, as the skin renews itself, the tan fades as skin cells are shed (one of the prime reasons people end up with unsightly orange streaks is because they forget to exfoliate beforehand). </p> <p>Fake-tan lotion was discovered by accident in the Twenties when a nurse treating a male diabetic patient with DHA accidentally spilled it on his chest while connecting his drip. The next day, she noticed it had stained his skin. Derived from plant sources such as sugar cane, DHA is now the main active ingredient in all sunless tanning skincare products. 'It's by far the most effective,' explains McManus. 'That's quite unusual because we are all relying on the same prime ingredient. The main way of differentiating your product is the percentage of DHA used in the formula - you use a higher percentage if you want a darker skin tone. Then you need to concentrate on making it easier to use and getting a more even result.'</p> <p>The reliance on a single ingredient has led to feverish competition among cosmetics companies. The precise quantities used in any given product remain a closely guarded secret, much like the fabled Coca-Cola recipe. The most successful brands thus encourage consumer loyalty by marketing specific shades of tan for different skins. Fake Bake is one of a number of companies that has developed a range of tanners for fairer complexions. </p> <p>It now has a turnover of \u00a34.5m. Johnson's Holiday Skin, which combines self-tanning with a daily moisturiser to build up a gradual tan, accounts for more than 11 per cent of sales in the self-tan sector, worth \u00a330m. While there are now fake tans which include 'anti-ageing' ingredients, methods which use different shades of colour to make you look thinner or more toned, and products which claim to last longer, the future for self-tanning lies in discovering a naturally derived organic ingredient with a sun protection factor that can rival Dihydroxyacetone. L'Or\u00e9al scientists have already found one. 'It's all very new,' says McManus, nervously. 'I don't even know the name of it, but it is plant-derived.' </p> <p>The pursuit of beauty has long involved such obscure and inventive alchemy, but it used to be for precisely the opposite reasons. In the 4th century BC, Grecian women painted their faces with white lead. The Romans applied pastes of narcissus, lentils, honey, wheat and eggs to achieve pale complexions, and Homer described the perfect female face as 'whiter than ivory'. Even in the 19th century, upper-class women were being encouraged to stay out of the sun as much as possible. Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, was not considered wholly beautiful because of her tanned face - the product of too much walking in the countryside. In the Victorian era, tanned skin denoted the manual, outdoor labour of the lower classes, rather than the unpolluted translucence of the idle aristocracy.</p> <p>For western caucasian women, the notion of fragile femininity changed after the First World War, when a new generation abandoned their corsets and started to enjoy sports, travel and adventure with gusto. If you were rich enough, you holidayed on the Riviera or the Amalfi Coast and a suntan became the status symbol of success, sophistication and wealth. The shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis once opined that in order to be successful, one must 'keep looking tanned, live in an elegant building (even if you're in the cellar), be seen in smart restaurants (even if you only nurse one drink) and if you borrow, borrow big.'</p> <p>'I think a tan can still give you that self-esteem boost,' says Michelle Feeney, the chief executive of St Tropez, one of the UK's leading self-tanning brands. 'Like many people, I tend to have a spray tan if I have an important event coming up or a work function to go to. It's about how to make the tan look natural that's crucial, and that's what we're known for, because there's nothing worse than that really heavy, dark, weird colour.'</p> <p>But it is precisely this heavy, dark weirdness that runs the risk of pricking the fake tan bubble. With the advent of cheap flights and package holidays, a beach trip abroad is no longer a rarefied luxury and the tan has been simultaneously democratised. Now fake tan has become ubiquitous. While the credit crunch threatens holidays abroad, it also means women are opting for cheaper luxuries. Traditionally, recession sparks an increase in lipstick sales, as women buy make-up to cheer themselves up because they can't afford a new dress. This year, self-tan has become the pick-me-up of choice. </p> <p>'There's nothing original any more about fake tan and it's possible that more and more people have realised it carries a social stigma,' says manners coach and broadcaster William Hanson. 'I think it will come full circle and be fashionable once again to be pale, because people don't want to appear ostentatious.'</p> <p>And, as beauty consultant Wendy Lewis points out, 'We have seen this trend come and go. Right now it's in high gear. Next year, an obvious orangey hue may become d\u00e9class\u00e9. It is something that goes with trout pouts and hair extensions, and overblown breast implants.'</p> <p>Back at The Tanning Shop, I put this to Leanne. Is her sunless tan a sign of ostentatious vulgarity rather than discreet affluence? Is she wilfully ignoring the ubiquity of fake tanning during a period of economic downturn? She glances at me pityingly. </p> <p>'I like looking tanned,' she says, her suntan radiating from her like sonar. 'It makes me feel good and that's all that matters.' </p> <p>She walks off down the street, receding into a sea of grey and white, until all that's left is a vague smell of digestive biscuits.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday August 17 2008. Above we inadvertently described DHA (Dihydroxyacetone) as an 'amino acid' but it is a three-carbon molecule related to sugars. It reacts with amino acids in the skin to produce the effect of a tan.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Audi A3 Cabriolet</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00a320,750</strong></p> <p><strong>Miles per gallon: </strong> 55.4</p> <p><strong>Seats: </strong> 4</p> <p><strong>Good for: </strong>Top marks</p> <p><strong>Bad for: </strong>Crass remarks</p> <p>A lot can happen in nine seconds. It's the time it took Bayern Munich's Roy Makaay to score a goal against Real Madrid in the 2007 UEFA Champion's League. It's the time it took Usain Bolt to run 100m in New York in May. It's the time it took Harris Chan to break the world record for doing the Rubik's cube earlier this year. It's also the time that a student named Rich took to unclasp the bra straps of seven women (thank you, YouTube) and, if you are a quick reader, it's the time you have taken to read to this point. </p> <p>More importantly, it's the time it takes the fabric roof to fold neatly into the boot of Audi's sporty new compact cabriolet. That's quite a jump in the record stakes. It takes the BMW 1 Series convertible, the A3's only realistic competitor, a gasping and red-faced 22 seconds to convert - if that's the right word. The Astra Twin Top limps in at 30 seconds, while the Ford Focus CC takes a semi-comatose 35. You could open and shut the roof of the A3 almost four times in the aeon of finger-drumming boredom the Ford takes. The latter two are folding hard tops rather than cloth tops, which give you the flexibility of an all-weather saloon and a convertible, but I've always found the lack of boot space, the swollen rear end, the cramped back seats and the complexity of the opening mechanisms give you all the flexibility of a sergeant major at a passing-out ceremony. </p> <p>The A3 can also cleverly open and shut its roof at speeds of up to 18mph. Many convertibles can do it at a crawl; plenty can only do it at a standstill. It may seem an unnecessary perk, but it's surprising how useful it is, especially in the city. On the basic model, the roof is only semi-automatic: you have to clamp and unclamp it yourself, which is only really a problem if you have just had a set of 3in false nails stuck on. But the model I drove was fully automatic, so all you have to do is concentrate on not decapitating the kids. Or maybe that would be another bonus.</p> <p>Audi is on a mission to become the country's biggest-selling premium marque. Last year it sold 30,936 models compared to BMW's 33,326 and Mercedes-Benz's 23,003. And this new A3 will only confirm Audi's status. The build quality is outstanding. Week in, week out I am lucky enough to find myself behind the wheels of some very posh cars, but slipping into the A3, you immediately sense that the benchmark has been raised. From the lush interior's tactile surfaces to the emotive, sophisticated design and the exhilarating drive, Audi ensures you feel you are in the poshest of company.</p> <p>There are four engine options - two variants of the FSi petrol and two direct-injection turbo diesels - and they all drive the front wheels. The Sport version with the 2-litre 200bhp engine will do 0-60mph in 7.3 seconds and has a top speed of 144mph.</p> <p>So is the A3 cab for you? It is, Audi believes, if you are middle-aged, have children under 18, are more than likely a woman, and have a high level of education and income and other cars within the household.

  "<p>With the cost of living soaring and the credit crunch still biting, the need for financial advice has never been so important. Yet new findings have revealed that more than half of the people aged over 18 in Britain have never sought advice from a financial adviser, and a fifth say it is just too expensive. </p> <p>This is according to insurance company Zurich, whose research also shows that one in eight of those surveyed relied only on friends and family for advice. 'The sheer number of people walking blind into their financial decision-making presents a disturbing trend and an alarming picture for the future,' says Tony Solomon, a director at Zurich. </p> <p>Trust is also a major factor in the decision not to seek financial advice - which may come as little surprise when a recent undercover investigation by consumer body Which? found that just four out of 50 advisers, comprising banks, estate agents and independent mortgage advisers, gave 'acceptable advice'.</p> <p>Its results show that 41 out of 50 failed to provide pieces of key information, and 35 failed to do a proper check to ensure the individual could afford to repay a mortgage; many simply failed to tailor their advice to the individual's needs. </p> <p>Further, earlier this year, the Financial Services Consumer Panel carried out its own research and found that the advice market was in 'urgent need of change'. According to its findings, consumers were 'generally confused about the type of advice they are receiving' and 'resigned to not getting the best advice when they talk to a financial adviser'.</p> <p>While all this may sound rather off-putting, the value of advice has never been greater and consumers should not be deterred from seeking expert help. </p> <p>The Association of Independent Financial Advisers (AIFA) suggests that consumer trust in financial services institutions could be 'dramatically increased' if there were clearer demarcation between financial sales and advice. </p> <p>At present, there are three main types of adviser: tied advisers who only recommend products from one company, such as a bank; multi-tied advisers who recommend products from a panel of providers, and independent financial advisers (IFAs) who have access to the whole of the market and have to find the most suitable product for their clients' needs. </p> <p>When it comes to paying for advice, it is still common for advisers to get commission from banks, insurers or pension providers on products that are bought by their client. But there are concerns that this method of remuneration is flawed, as advisers may allow this commission to influence their recommendations. </p> <p>The good news is the Financial Services Authority (FSA) wants to radically overhaul the way we get - and pay for - financial advice. It aims to impose new criteria that firms must meet to be able to call themselves independent - such as not being able to accept commission. It is also proposing there should be just two types of adviser: one that gives advice and one that merely sells products, which should help to clear up some of the confusion. However, with new rules unlikely to come in for another year, it is crucial to remain vigilant. And, in the meantime, you can help yourself by making use of the resources available to you. </p> <p>When it comes to finding a financial adviser, personal recommendation is one of the best methods, but there are other starting points. A website run by the IFA trade body Ifap - <a href=\"http://www.unbiased.co.uk\">www.unbiased.co.uk</a> - lists 9,000 IFA firms, all of whom are verified against the FSA's database. </p> <p>'With the site, you can input your preferences in detail,' says Ifap's David Elms. 'Once you've got a list of advisers who match your criteria, arrange to meet two or three. Find out what existing customers have to say; inquire as to whether you can get hold of testimonials.'</p> <p>Before signing on the dotted line, make sure you check whether the adviser is independent, and how you are going to be paying for your advice. Then, once you've signed up, establish how things will work on an ongoing basis. </p> <p>'Ask the adviser how often they are going to review your circumstances. Remember that this is a business relationship and that you're the one making the decisions,' says Elms. 'And, if one particular adviser is not right for you, remember there will always be someone else who wants to do the job.'</p> <h2>Case study</h2> <p>Jacquie Harris, 52, who lives near Polperro in Cornwall, decided to search for an independent financial adviser (IFA) after having a bad experience with an adviser from her bank, and is now a client of Addidi Wealth.</p> <p>'I was recently widowed and in quite a vulnerable position, and wanted advice on what do with a substantial amount of money that I had inherited,' says Jacquie, who runs a five-star boutique bed-and-breakfast on a farm with her partner, Yaron Peled. 'I spoke to a bank adviser who told me to put all the money in once place. I did what he suggested, as I thought I was getting good financial advice, and he, unsurprisingly, was very happy to take the commission.'</p> <p>However, Jacquie then spoke to one of her friends who works in the financial sector, who was concerned about the advice she had been given - and who recommended Jacquie speak to an IFA.</p> <p>'My IFA took the time to work through piles of documents with me, went through all the financial planning I should have in place at my stage in life, and put me back on a good financial footing,' she says. Jacquie now has her money spread across a range of savings and investments.</p> <p>'Given my situation, as a widow with three grown-up children, I wanted to have low-risk investments, and Addidi has helped me to spread the risk,' she says. 'I get peace of mind from knowing that my money is being managed well, and am not too worried about the current market volatility, as I'm in it for the long term.'</p> <p>Jacquie now meets her IFA twice a year to review the financial planning she has in place.</p>",
  "<h2>Vincent Cable<br>Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman</h2> <p>My starting point would be to secure Gordon Brown's main achievement: the independence of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee. It will be necessary to see off all kinds of arguments in the next few years to change (that is, increase) the inflation target or redraw the MPC's mandate to relegate inflation to a subordinate objective.</p> <p>There is more to be done to restore credibility to fiscal policy. The government's rules have been subject to repeated fiddling and will never be credible while it sets its own tests and marks them. They need to be reinforced by ensuring that the definition of the cycle and performance is assessed independently of government.</p> <p>The most important challenge relates to the 'credit crunch' and the falling housing market. It is not the government's job to underpin house prices. Neither should it rescue banks themselves (as opposed to depositors), whose reckless lending helped to precipitate the crisis. It should therefore avoid proposals for state guarantees of new bank lending or stamp duty relief (as opposed to reform of the stamp duty 'slab' system). </p> <p>I would like to see a much more ambitious programme, allowing social landlords and councils to acquire, at an appropriate discount, surplus private housing. Second, there must be intervention to stop the headlong rush towards large-scale home repossessions. </p> <p>There is an industry 'code of conduct' involving the provision of advice and alternative options for families in distress. This should be put on a statutory footing.</p> <p>Beyond immediate rescue operations, we need to look to a reformed financial services sector, which cannot be allowed to return to its freewheeling ways, on the assumption that when the casino gets into trouble, the government will save it. </p> <p>The squeeze on disposable incomes is provoking demands for government help with energy, food and other bills. It cannot afford to hold down petrol prices, nor should it. What it should do is demand more from energy utilities, which have benefited from the free allocation of valuable permits under the European carbon trading scheme. They should be required to introduce meaningful social tariffs for low-income consumers and ambitious energy conservation programmes.</p> <p>That apart, the best way to counter the squeeze on incomes is to ensure the tax burden is more fairly distributed. I would lift the burden on low- and middle-income families through cuts in income tax, paid for through a mixture of redistributive taxation on the wealthy, plus green taxes.</p> <h2>Philip Hammond<br>Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury</h2> <p>As we mark the first anniversary of the credit crunch, Britain is facing its biggest economic crisis in many years. Unemployment is rising, the housing bubble is bursting and inflation has doubled since 1997. Britain has the highest budget deficit in the developed world.</p> <p>A struggling economy means less money to deliver shared objectives, such as making child poverty history and improving standards in our schools and hospitals. But Alistair Darling repeats the mantra that all our economic problems are global. Gordon Brown, taking his centralising instincts to new heights, preaches at people to stop wasting food. Meanwhile, the poorest in society struggle to cope with soaring bills in the face of more tax rises. International companies are preparing to leave Britain because of politically driven U-turns over tax policy.</p> <p>Part of our economic predicament is global. But a significant part of it is home-grown. We might have expected a new Prime Minister to have demonstrated some kind of political leadership. But instead of long-term conviction, we have seen dithering, incompetence and short-term calculation.</p> <p>This week government incompetence has impacted on the real economy. Irresponsible briefing that a stamp duty holiday was being considered was compounded by chaos as ministers issued contradictory statements. The result, confirmed by the National Association of Estate Agents, is that sales are falling through as buyers hold out for tax relief. Housing minister Caroline Flint's only reaction was denial. Darling must adopt our fully funded proposal to abolish stamp duty for 90 per cent of buyers.</p> <p>So the job of restoring responsible management of the economy is likely to fall to the Conservatives. And we have practical, sensible measures that will mitigate the burden on families and businesses in the short term, while strengthening our economy for the long term.</p> <p>We are consulting on proposals for a Fair Fuel Stabiliser, so that when petrol prices rise, the government uses the extra revenue it gets from North Sea Oil to cut fuel duty. We are campaigning for next year's planned increases in road tax to be scrapped. We believe we should cut tax rates for companies. We will improve the process of making tax law. And we should look at reforming insolvency law, so that basically sound companies are given time to come up with a rescue plan.</p> <p>In the longer term, we must strengthen the fundamentals. We need to ensure that Britain lives within its means, by sharing the proceeds of growth between increased public spending and lower taxes. And we need to set ourselves on the path to sustainable growth by giving our businesses the freedom to compete.</p> <p>Britain needs a clear direction on economic policy. But only an election will deliver the leadership we need.</p>",
  "<p>Happy birthday, credit crunch. Over the past year, fortunes have been lost, venerable Wall Street institutions humbled, and financial titans overthrown. It began with mass defaults by American borrowers, but now it's Britain's homeowners who are on the slippery slope to negative equity.</p> <p>All this has thrown up much-discussed proposals for practical solutions concerning nimbler financial regulators, stricter capital requirements for banks and all the rest.</p> <p>But zooming out from the mind-numbing minutiae of the crisis, broader ideas emerge, with ramifications far beyond finance. The first is that even the smoothest of 'hedgies' and the whizziest of financial masterminds can get it completely, utterly wrong. Like the rest of us, they are vulnerable to believing their own myth, following the herd and a host of other psychological delusions.</p> <p>Once we accept that, a great swathe of received political wisdom looks ripe for a rethink. If anyone is in dire need of a relaunch, it's New Labour: so perhaps instead of firing off brainwaves about stamp duty holidays from his deckchair, Gordon Brown could find the time for some serious thought about the limitations of the free market.</p> <p>Throughout the past decade, the government has relied on the mighty power of 'market discipline' to provide answers to a whole range of questions, from what private equity bosses should earn, to how to produce enough energy to stop the lights going out. Even where full-blown privatisation is beyond the pale, policies are used to mimic markets.</p> <p>Donors to academy schools buy themselves a say in the curriculum, as if having a few million quid to spare implies special knowledge about what children need to learn. Efficiency, targets and choice are everywhere - and none of us are meant to mind as the incomes of the super-rich shoot into the stratosphere.</p> <p>Ironically, it's David Cameron's Conservatives who've begun to question the limits of winner-takes-all capitalism: proposing a new tax on non-domiciled individuals, quickly taken up by Alistair Darling in the autumn, and, last week, praising the egalitarian pay policies of department store John Lewis.</p> <p>Even some economists have begun to doubt that their traditional models, describing rational, well-informed, selfish individuals, tell us much about the real world. In a lively new book, Basic Instincts, Pete Lunn describes some of the findings of the flourishing field of behavioural economics, which uses the tools of psychology, including experiments, to show that - surprise, surprise - our decisions are subject to a strong dose of ignorance and irrationality; and notions such as co-operation and fairness are important.</p> <p>In this fluid intellectual climate, Brown's insistence on seeking a 'private sector solution' to the Northern Rock collapse, earlier this year, appeared not as an admirable laissez-faire principle, but an ideological hang-up about avoiding nationalisation.</p> <p>Of course, the aspirations to collective ownership expressed in Clause Four of the Labour party's constitution were hopelessly nostalgic. But there's a broad spectrum of possibilities between workers seizing control of the fruits of their industry and allowing the City to let rip.</p> <p>It may not fit the received wisdom of the past 20 years, but sometimes, ordinary punters may need protection, not just from predatory businesses that deliberately set out to exploit them, but also from their own inability to make sophisticated financial decisions, or foresee the great tides - such as housing market booms and busts - that may wash them away.</p> <p>If mighty City traders with PhDs in mathematics have watched with horror as their brilliant strategies crashed and burned, how much more bewildering is it for homeowners who have been told 'You can't go wrong with bricks and mortar' to see the value of their biggest asset collapsing around them?</p> <p>Deep down everyone knows nothing good can last for ever, but we're also subject to what Yale economist Robert Shiller calls the 'social contagion' of market ideas. 'The sub-prime crisis was essentially psychological in origin, as are all bubbles,' he says in his forthcoming book The Sub-prime Solution.</p> <p>We all know people who've blown a student loan on gig tickets and gin and tonic with little thought as to whether and when they'll ever be able to pay it back, bought a bigger car than they could afford, or taken out an endowment mortgage on the promise of a windfall, only to find it falls far short.</p> <p>Governments can't and shouldn't tame every prodigal son; but there are consequences for all of us when a large proportion of the population gets swept along by get-rich-quick myths. It would help if we weren't all so ignorant about finance - all kids should be taught about credit cards and mortgages at school. But the experience of the credit crunch should also instill a healthy dose of scepticism about 'market solutions' in other areas, too.</p> <p>Management consultants don't always know best, notwithstanding the billions of pounds of public money spent on them. Giving parents and patients more choice won't help if they don't have the expertise to know which teacher or surgeon is better, the time to do the research, or the cash to afford to travel miles to the best hospital or school. Liberalising energy supplies has delivered huge profits to producers, and left most homeowners with rocketing bills, and little or no idea how to compare one company with another. If we all learn one thing from this torrid 12 months, it must surely be that markets are not possessed of any special genius. Sometimes, the private sector solution is simply the wrong one.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> William Keegan is away</p>",
  "<p>The greater part of this box set documents a neglected period in UK rock story: those diffuse years between psychedelia and glam, a time of drift and discovery during which Kevin Ayers recorded four albums for EMI's 'head' imprint Harvest. Listening to the selections included on the first two discs of Songs For Insane Times you can trace an arc from 1967-style carefree innocence to the fundamentally melancholy hedonism of the early Seventies. </p> <p>The lighter side of Ayers is not so far from Donovan. He wrote a string of wistful ditties about faintly aristocratic, 'See Emily Play'-style dream girls ('The Lady Rachel', 'Eleanor's Cake', 'Girl on a Swing'), while the lovely 'May I' presents Ayers as a modern-day courtly lover entranced by a beauty in a cafe, happy just to look but not touch. 'Clarence in Wonderland' offers a LSD-era variation on the classic 'come up and see my etchings' come-on: 'Let's go/ To my chateau/ We can have a good time/ Drinking lots of sky wine.' </p> <p>But only a few years on, 1973's 'Oh! Wot a Dream' offered an elegy for the fading utopianism of Ayers's generation, disguised as a fond tribute to Syd Barrett. In rock bohemia, collective dreams of change were superseded by an ideal of 'decadence'. Which was the title Ayers chose for another paean to a rock icon friend of his, Nico. It's a loving, painfully empathetic portrait of an ice queen 'suffering from wear and tear,' who keeps slipping back into 'liquid night' despite the outstretched arms of her retinue of lovers. Built out of a radiantly rippling wall of tape-delayed guitar, 'Decadence' is one of the most transcendent pieces of rock of its era. Addressing the same topic but as a disturbing self-portrait, 'Song From the Bottom of a Well' combines a jolting noise-scape of guitar-squall with oblique lyrics about the dangers of self-medication and solipsism: this well is full of wine not water, with Ayers happy to drown because he sees 'all the universe as a comfortable bath'. </p> <p>Ayers's sound on the first four Harvest albums was too poppy to be prog but too proggy to really make it as pop, especially when his band was the Whole World: classical composer David Bedford on lava lamp squiggly keyboards, free improviser Lol Coxhill and his parping and tootling sax, frequently amazing guitar from a pre-Tubular Mike Oldfield. The result was marvellously wonky tunes like 'Stop this Train' and 'Shooting at the Moon'. Later, on, as Ayers worked with more straightforward musicians, the gold to lead ratio declines. For example, 'Caribbean Moon' is typically tropical tripe, horribly catchy cod calypso. </p> <p>Later there's just the odd twilight gem, like the punky 'Observations'. Overall, though, the template of chansonnier and backing band generates few sparks. Still, even treading water and going through jaded yet still debonair motions, Ayers never lost his charm. Like an English Lou Reed, he's not, strictly speaking, a good singer, but remains one of the great voices in British music.</p> <p><strong>Download:</strong> 'Decadence'; 'Stop This Train'; 'May I'; 'Shooting at the Moon'</p>",
  "<p>The Caucasus is the kind of place where, when the guns start firing, it's hard to stop them. That is the brutal reality of South Ossetia, where a small conflict is beginning to spread exponentially.</p> <p>Leave aside the geopolitics for the moment and have pity for the people who will suffer most from this, the citizens - mostly ethnic Ossetians but also Georgians - who have already died in their hundreds. It is a tiny and vulnerable place, with no more than 75,000 inhabitants of both nationalities mixed up in a patchwork of villages and one sleepy provincial town in the foothills of the Caucasus. </p> <p>Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili seems to care less about these people than about asserting that they live in Georgian territory. Otherwise he would not on the night of 7-8 August have launched a massive artillery assault on the town of Tskhinvali, which has no purely military targets and whose residents, the Georgians say, lest we forget, are their own citizens. This is a blatant breach of international humanitarian law. </p> <p>Moscow cares as little about the Ossetians as it does the Georgians it is bombing, regarding South Ossetia as a pawn in its bid to bring Georgia and its neighbours back into a Russian sphere of influence. Ordinary South Ossetians have also been cursed by a criminalised leadership which would long ago have lost power had they not been the rallying point for defence against Georgia.</p> <p>This conflict was entirely avoidable. Its origin lies in one of the many majority-minority disputes that accompanied the break-up of the Soviet Union. The Ossetians, a divided people with one part living on the Russian north side of the Caucasus, the other in Georgia, generally felt more comfortable with Russian rule than in a new post-Soviet Georgian state. A small nasty war with Tbilisi in 1990-91 cost 1,000 lives and left huge bitterness.</p> <p>But outside high politics, ethnic relations were never bad. For a decade after South Ossetia's de facto secession from Georgia in 1991, it was a shady backwater and smugglers' haven. It was outside nominal Georgian control, but Ossetians and Georgians went back and forth and traded vigorously with one another at an untaxed market in the village of Ergneti. </p> <p>Then Saakashvili came to power in 2004 with heady promises to restore his country's lost territories. He closed the Ergneti market and tried to cut off South Ossetia, triggering a summer of violence. Modelling himself on the medieval Georgian king David the Builder, he said Georgian territorial integrity would be re-established by the end of his presidency. He has sought to tear up the imperfect Russian-framed negotiating framework for South Ossetia, but has not come up with a viable alternative. </p> <p>For their part, the Russians upped the stakes and baited Saakashvili, their b\u00eate noire, by effecting a soft annexation of South Ossetia. Moscow handed out Russian passports to the South Ossetians and installed Russian officials in government posts there. Russian soldiers, notionally peacekeepers, have acted as an informal occupying army.</p> <p>Saakashvili is a famously volatile risk-taker, veering between warmonger and peacemaker, democrat and autocrat. On several occasions international officials have pulled him back from the brink. On a visit to Washington in 2004, he received a tongue-lashing from then Secretary of State Colin Powell who told him to act with restraint. Two months ago, he could have triggered a war with his other breakaway province of Abkhazia by calling for the expulsion of Russian peacekeepers from there, but European diplomats persuaded him to step back. This time he has yielded to provocation and stepped over the precipice. </p> <p>The provocation is real, but the Georgian President is rash to believe this is a war he can win or that the West wants it. Both George Bush and John McCain have visited Georgia, made glowing speeches praising Saakashvili and were rewarded with the Order of St George. But Bush, at least in public, is now bound to be cautious, calling for a ceasefire.</p> <p>The reaction in much of Europe will be much less forgiving. Even before this crisis, a number of governments, notably France and Germany, were reporting 'Georgia fatigue'. Though they broadly wished the Saakashvili government well, they did not buy the line that he was a model democrat - the sight last November of his riot police tear-gassing protesters in Tbilisi and smashing up an opposition TV station dispelled that illusion. And they have a long agenda of issues with Russia, which they regard as more important than the post-Soviet quarrel between Moscow and Tbilisi. Paris and Berlin will now say they were right to urge caution on Georgia's Nato ambitions at the Bucharest Nato summit. </p> <p>Both sides are behaving badly. It is outrageous that Russia is seizing the chance to attack Georgian towns and airfields. Dozens of Georgian civilians are now dying too. But Georgia needs to be restrained, for its own sake. Otherwise Saakashvili looks set to lose both the economic stability he has achieved and hope of Nato membership. He already looks now to have forfeited his other lost territory of Abkhazia and the prospect of return there for the quarter of a million Georgians who fled the region during the 1992-93 war. Now it looks as though the Abkhaz are going on the offensive, taking the opportunity to tell the world that they will never return to Georgian rule. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Thomas de Waal is Caucasus Editor at the Institute for War and Peace Reporting in London</p>",
  "<p>This week Barack Obama is enjoying a brief respite from the campaign madhouse on the beaches of Hawaii. But the madness itself never pauses, of course. As Obama departed for the state where he grew up, the Republican Party sent him off with a 'Travel Guide' mocking the upscale prep school Obama attended. A McCain campaign supporter marvelled that Obama would be 'swimming' while Americans grappled with high gas prices. And McCain sent him off with a new round of attack ads focusing on Obama's allegedly Paris Hilton-esque celebrity glow. 'Life in the spotlight must be grand,' explains one. 'But for the rest of us, times are tough.'</p> <p>Petty and churlish, perhaps, but a growing number of Democrats suspect that relentless attacks by McCain and the Republican party may be taking a toll on Obama. Indeed, despite the political tailwinds at Obama's back, and the smooth execution of his vaunted overseas tour last month, he maintains a conspicuously modest lead over his Republican rival. And even as the Obama brand underperforms, the McCain brand is overperforming: The Arizona senator is faring much better than one would reasonably expect of a determined Iraq war supporter and faithful ally of George Bush in the ugly sunset of the post-9/11 Republican era. When Obama and McCain head to their parties' conventions this month, Obama must find a way to change that dynamic, or risk seeing his fragile lead slip away. </p> <p>Ever since he dispatched Hillary Clinton, Obama has held that steady but slim advantage over McCain. According to the running average of major presidential polls, Obama now leads McCain by 3.6 points. That is nothing to sneer at. Remember: George W Bush actually lost the popular vote in 2000 and still took the presidency after winning more electoral votes than Al Gore (with some help from the US Supreme Court). And by most counts Obama enjoys a substantial edge in the state-by-state electoral count. He is, by any measure, winning.</p> <p>Yet as seen in another context - the overall mood of the electorate - Obama's lead is decidedly underwhelming. Asked to state their generic preference for Congressional candidates, voters say they prefer Democrats to Republicans by a roughly 10-point margin. In other words, Obama is lagging behind his party's overall brand by about seven points. McCain, by contrast, runs ahead of his fellow Republicans by about five points. This most unusual situation gives Republicans an improbable glimmer of hope at a time when their party name is almost synonymous with incompetence and corruption.</p> <p>Most striking, perhaps, is the gulf between how voters see McCain and the Republican party's titular leader, Bush. The President's approval ratings are now hovering just below 30 per cent, yet polls show McCain drawing an average of 43 per cent.</p> <p>This is too close for comfort. Conditions in Iraq are steadily improving. The US economy may have hit bottom, and with oil and gas prices dropping and even the dollar inching back up, it's possible voter bitterness towards Republicans will subside enough to let McCain sneak into office.</p> <p>How can this be? One reason involves the familiar forces dragging at Obama. He is relatively young and inexperienced - and, as you may have noticed, dark-skinned and bears a name not likely to be found in many small-town-America phone books.</p> <p>Less discussed are the reasons why McCain is faring so much better than his party. The answer lies in McCain's public identity. It is premised on his reputation as a different kind of Republican - a 'maverick', an independent crusader willing to challenge his own party on principled grounds. McCain deservedly earned this reputation in the late '90s, when he battled Republican leaders on issues such as tobacco regulation and campaign finance reform; and during his 2000 campaign, when he railed against Wall Street and religious-right leaders. McCain once even cast himself as Luke Skywalker battling through the Death Star - his party's corrupt establishment.</p> <p>But to win the Republican nomination, McCain has had to recast his identity. He has embraced Bush's enormous tax cuts, which he once opposed. He has dropped his critiques of religious leaders such as Jerry Falwell. He has largely abandoned his anti-corporate rhetoric. On the Iraq war McCain has expressed only tactical differences with the President. And during the 2004 campaign, McCain was a crucial supporter of Bush. As McCain himself recently put it: 'On the transcendent issues, the most important issues of our day, I've been totally in agreement and support of President Bush.'</p> <p>And yet many an American voter knows little of this recent history. An admiring press spent far more time building up McCain's image as an independent maverick than it has explaining his new Politburo persona.</p> <p>Some Americans may simply admire McCain's past as a Vietnam veteran and prisoner of war who valiantly refused early release from captivity. But to date the Obama Democrats have been far too delicate about spotlighting McCain's political mythology. To be fair, they have been preoccupied with the reasonable goal of introducing their unconventional candidate to middle America. There was the television ad noting Obama's white maternal family; the recent recalibrations on issues such as domestic wiretapping and gun control; and the big 'patriotism' speech assuring voters (who may have seen otherwise on the internet) that, yes, Obama loves America.</p> <p>The Democratic national convention in Denver at the end of August is the moment to change this tone once and for all. As Jonathan Chait recently noted in the Los Angeles Times, John Kerry's team erred in 2004 by focusing his party's convention almost exclusively around their candidate without targeting Bush's weaknesses. While they command America's attention in Denver, the Democrats should hammer McCain with a new degree of vigour. The Obama campaign finally began that process last week, with a pair of negative ads tying McCain to Bush. But the counterattack must be intensified. The goal must be to convince voters that McCain really is just like any other Republican - part of the 30 per cent ghetto with Bush. During one debate with Hillary Clinton, Obama memorably cracked that McCain's 'Straight Talk Express' campaign bus had lost its wheels. This clever formulation should be a Democratic mantra. They need to drive home that McCain is in line with his party on tax rates for the wealthy, on the size of government, on war in Iraq. That he has described the social security system as a 'disgrace', and supports a highly unpopular Republican plan to privatise the system. And that, although he has spoken out against the fraud and corruption of recent years, he is part and parcel of the machine that enabled his party's perversions.</p> <p>Obama and company will have to walk a tricky line, however. Party conventions should be generally upbeat and focused around the candidate's best qualities. And Obama himself looks best floating above the muddy scrum and extolling his politics of hope. Much of the dirty work will have to be left to surrogates - other prominent Democrats who can twist the knife into McCain, preferably with a smile. Bill and Hillary Clinton are fine candidates - never mind that they may be secretly rooting for Obama's defeat this autumn. (Hillary 2012!) Or perhaps members of the Kennedy family, who will command particular attention for the tragic reason of Senator Ted Kennedy's brain cancer, can implore America to see McCain for what he truly is.</p> <p>This effort will have to continue past Denver, of course. Obama's task will be complicated by the absence of a strong attack-dog infrastructure of the sort other recent presidential candidates have enjoyed. He actively discouraged the work of independent, largely unregulated groups which, in 2004, turned huge campaign contributions into notoriously harsh national advertising. But without them providing air support, Obama's team has no choice but to fight a nastier ground war on their own.</p> <p>Obama has been in this position before. Late in 2007, pundits and supporters complained that he was not waging a tough enough campaign against Hillary Clinton. He first counselled patience, then sharpened his tone, and the rest is history. The difference is that Obama was trailing then and is leading now. He may be tempted to cruise along at a high altitude - particularly given his personal disdain for negative politics. But the fact is that he can't afford to. When Democrats arrive in Denver two weeks from now, they should be ready to throw a party. But they must also be ready to throw some heavy punches.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Michael Crowley is senior editor at New Republic magazine and The Observer's chief American commentator.

  "<p>Well, the Chinese can certainly put on a do. At the Olympics opening ceremony, fireworks were blasting about, hither and thither, like some celestial Jean Michel Jarre concert. And did you see that bit where the Olympic logo was hoisted in the air like five giant shimmering Polo mints? Impressive stuff. And all the time. I was thinking: is it too late for us to get out of hosting this borathon in 2012?</p> <p>Is it my imagination or, with the Chinese Olympics barely begun, is everyone already either bored stiff or openly hostile? Every report is about the smog, heat, commercialisation, dope tests, blah. And that's not even starting on the human rights issues; so bad even President Bush feels entitled to have a go.</p> <p>Then there's the great unmentionable - the fact that, whoever the host nation is, the Olympics are always (whisper it) knuckle-chewingly tedious. I keep reading that, this year, there is an estimated global audience of three billion, but who are these people? I don't think I've ever met a person who genuinely cares. Nor can I recall popping around to someone's house, and being told: 'Ssh, damn you - the Olympics are on.'</p> <p>Indeed, no offence to 'Team GB', but does anyone care about discus throwing, swimming, or fencing? Leastways in the relationship-ending way they care when you start up the vacuum cleaner during a penalty shoot out. Though there are exceptions. When Frankie Gavin, the boxer came home in tears for failing to lose a few pounds to reach his target weight, there couldn't have been a woman in Britain who didn't feel his pain.</p> <p>The occasional Olympic event or personality might have caught the public imagination over the years (Daley, Kelly, the rowing champs, Eddie the Eagle). But on the whole, the Olympics are akin to a giant internationally sanctioned parents' race on school sports day, and who wants to watch that? Indeed, the Olympics has to be most boring, sprawling, least loved, most over-produced and expensive sporting tournament ever. And in 2012 it's all ours. It doesn't bode well. People are already complaining about the millions it cost to join the Chinese Olympics. Can you imagine the whingeing when we host the thing? By 2012, the Olympics will have been damned as a 'national folly', like the Millennium Dome, only with javelins. Everywhere, people will be moaning that they never wanted them in the first place. And while much has been made of the Chinese public being ordered to view their Olympics as the 'pivotal moment of their generation', I can't imagine them pulling that off here. Refuseniks and curmudgeons that we are, the British Olympics probably won't even rate as the pivotal moment of the fortnight.</p> <p>That's if we are even ready in time. In place of trillion-dollar opening night firework displays and giant shimmering hoops, one can just imagine the 2012 British version: officials charging around, tipping crisps into bowls at the last minute, giving foreign dignitaries sparklers to write their name in the air. Andy Burnham, or his equivalent, standing in the stadium, watched by billions around the world, red-faced, shouting: 'Someone must know where we put the catherine wheels!'</p> <p>And even if it isn't as bad as that, if our opening ceremony isn't like Abigail's Party with neon, if we do end up with bronze for curling, who can seriously be bothered? Rather than hosting the Olympics I'm sure, like me, the majority of Britons would prefer to do something more rewarding and enjoyable - such as feeding our arms into a giant meat grinder? Indeed, with only four years to go, we should start backing out now, using methods subtle and perhaps not so subtle.</p> <p>It could be like when you've had a couple too many in the pub and start agreeing to horrible hiking holidays with friends, and the next morning you have to ring and say: 'Oh sorry, I just checked the dates, and I can't make it after all. Shame that.'</p> <p>Alternatively, there is still time to offload it onto another country, the same way people in offices always try to get others to do boring tasks under the guise of: 'It's such a great opportunity, but I'm snowed under - do you want to do it? It will get you noticed by the people that matter.'</p> <p>But of course we won't do anything of the sort. The British Olympics of 2012 will happen, and we'll only have ourselves to blame for a daily helping of Sebastian Coe looking insufferably 'busy and important'. Just don't pretend you haven't been warned.</p> <h2>The latest speculation about Madeleine feels like exploitation to keep this sad story going</h2> <p>Dreadful though the thought is, is it time to hope that Madeleine McCann died the night she disappeared?</p> <p>Anything seems preferable to the explanation that she was abducted by a paedophile ring, and is perhaps still suffering. That it was always unlikely that some childless couple just fancied a little British girl, and all this time Madeleine has been enjoying ice cream and piano lessons. In their heart of hearts, the British public probably considered all this the moment Madeleine disappeared.</p> <p>Odd, then, that with the publishing of the case files, the 'paedo-ring' angle has been shoved in our faces as 'breaking news'. What's new about this news? Nothing of course. Just as there seems nothing particularly new about the sightings, some of which seem dubious to say the least. Surely anyone who'd have spotted Maddie, especially in those first feverish weeks, would have locked the door on her and her 'sinister' companions and screamed the place down.</p> <p>Who are these people who muse at their leisure on 'the strange sad blonde little girl' before calling the police? The real McCoy, or the usual attention-seeking nut-jobs - we'll never know. </p> <p>In the grand scheme of things, all this may seem harmless PR padding, but it isn't. The result is that 'Maddie-sightings' are going to end up having the same ring of authority as your bog-standard UFO, Elvis, or Lord Lucan spottings.</p> <p>By the same token, last week's sensational spin on what most of us guessed anyway, has given the case a dramatic unhelpful 'Maddie: the sequel' feel. A background hum of just wanting to keep the story going - to keep selling and exploiting as long as possible.</p> <p>None of which is remotely fair. In real terms the only new development is that the McCanns can feel vindicated at how shabbily the investigation was conducted - which is what they said all along. However, if the speculation turns out to be true, how hollow a victory is that?</p> <h2>Beyonc\u00e9 - irritatingly gorgeous in any light</h2> <p>Has Beyonc\u00e9 been 'white-washed', her skin tone digitally lightened, for those L'Or\u00e9al adverts? Her people and L'Or\u00e9al say not, and looking at the pictures, Beyonc\u00e9's skin doesn't seem so different to the (irritatingly gorgeous) shade I always thought it was. Still, let's face it, when Andie MacDowell was swishing her mane about for 'L'Or\u00e9al, yapping away about how she was 'worth it', you never got people musing that her skin had been made darker.</p> <p>It would be idiotic to claim there's no racism in advertising, that black faces weren't deemed a 'harder sell'. When Vogue Italia published its black model-only issue recently, it merely served to show how much virtually white-only editorial and advertising has been produced over the years.</p> <p>Saying that, I'm not sure this is Beyonc\u00e9's story. Nor for that matter L'Or\u00e9al's, who have a pretty good track record of using ethnic women in campaigns. Nor am I sure it's fair that black women can't opt for slightly lighter skin if they so wish. As things stand, a black female wanting lighter skin is deemed reductive and appalling. Meanwhile, white girls can go darker (with fake tans) any time they like. To clumsily paraphrase Orwell, it would seem that some forms of equality are still more 'equal' than others.</p>",
  "<p>The first big televised match of the new season takes place today when Manchester United and Portsmouth contest the Community Shield at Wembley, and it is fair to say that just about every referee in the country will be watching. What referees will be hoping to see is a sign of Respect, the Football Association's new cross-game commitment to improve standards of behaviour at all levels of football. </p> <p>The worst standards of behaviour, and the sort of physical and verbal abuse that deters many promising candidates from taking up refereeing, tend to occur at the opposite end of the spectrum to televised matches from Wembley, on the nation's park pitches and within the junior leagues. It has long been clear, though, that what is seen in Premier League games - the good and the bad - is copied almost religiously all the way down the pyramid.</p> <p>In other words the FA have realised there is no point asking grassroots football to clean up its act if the Ashley Coles and Javier Mascheranos of the professional world continue to treat referees with contempt, and so a new deal has been brokered between players and officials that takes effect from this weekend.</p> <p>'We are not expecting anything to change overnight, and this is not a campaign or a recruitment drive that will run for a couple of months then fade away,' Ian Blanchard, head of national referee development, says. 'We are in this for the long run, though hopefully people should start to see a difference right away. If the Community Shield passes without incident or controversy then fine, no one is going to complain about that, though I must admit I'm half hoping for something to happen early on so that the referee can deal with it.'</p> <p>Blanchard does not mean a foul or a penalty: referees will continue to deal with those in the usual way. He is referring to the sort of behaviour disenchanted viewers often cite when they complain the game has gone to the dogs. Cheating, diving, dissent, abuse, intimidation, spitting, swearing and general lack of respect for officials. Blanchard is sick of hearing of sports such as rugby held up as better examples, and has lost count of the number of headmasters and junior coaches who complain that the behaviour of children is directly influenced by the role models they see on television.</p> <p>What referees will now do is attempt to manage such situations by involving the team captains. There is a belief that once you tolerate a certain level of swearing, for example, or let a couple of over-agressive challenges go unpunished, then the problems increase as the game goes along.</p> <p>Under the Respect scheme, referees will speak to both captains before the game, then ask them to help control their own players if disciplinary problems arise during it. This can be viewed as a sort of safety valve or cooling-off mechanism. It emphasises the captain's responsibility for putting his own house in order, and stops the referee having to produce cards as a first recourse, which can often inflame situations by making the contest unequal or leaving one side feeling persecuted. That is basically all there is to it. Respect is simply an opportunity to remind players and officials that they need each other, need to work together, and have a greater responsibility to the overall good of the game.</p> <p>Doubtless some players would still turn their back on that, though it should not be underestimated how much ground referees are conceding. Blanchard argues, for example, that referees have no God-given right to respect on a football field. They have to earn it by being good at their job. This is quite a long way from the traditional point of view, which holds that the referee is always right and that all of football's various disciplinary problems can be laid at the door of misbehaving players.</p> <p>'This is an opportunity for us all to get back to some basics,' Blanchard says. 'We are not just appealing to players. Referees are not perfect, and their behaviour has sometimes exacerbated situations. Respect is as much about re-education of referees as players. There are better ways of dealing with issues on the field and we have to be more pro-active. If you allow dissent early in a game, for instance, it will breed during the rest of the game. Our message to referees is \"Don't ignore it, deal with it, but not necessarily with a caution.\" Football has changed a lot over the years, and we have to change with it. In the era of professional referees we can't just go around whistling and cautioning players, we have to manage games and situations within them. Referees have to be as professional as the best professional players.'</p> <p>Blanchard's department within the FA does not deal directly with Premier League games and officials, though the guidebook is the same across the board, and some of the 8,000 new referees he is hoping to recruit by 2012 will end up on the Premier League list. There are about 26,000 registered referees in England, an adequate number for most purposes, though 34,000 is roughly the figure needed to cover every organised game. It is not quite true to say Respect is a response to a crisis in refereeing, though the FA are hoping it will help address an image problem, not to mention the 220 reported assaults on match officials during last season or the 4,000 newly qualified referees who leave the game every year.</p> <p>Something else that might help is the occasional presence in the Premier League this season of Stuart Atwell, a 25-year-old referee from Nuneaton, who in some cases will be 10 years younger than the players he is supervising. Bold move or recipe for trouble? It will be a test, apart from anything else, of the new fast-track system. Alan Wilkie, retired Premier League official and current referees' assessor, has every confidence.</p> <p>'We've never had this situation before, but I have assessed this young man and he has all the skills and qualities, including maturity,' Wilkie says. 'The players respect his mobility and his ability, and that's why he has come through the ranks so quickly. He deserves it. Of course he will find the Premier League a challenge, but that is what refereeing is all about. At any level you choose it is always a challenge.'</p>",
  "<p>When Sebastian Coe failed his 11-plus examination, his father, Peter, took him aside and warned him: 'You can either be a secondary-modern drop-out or get down to it and get your O-levels.' That single piece of advice changed not only the course of young Seb's life but also that of athletics and Olympic history.</p> <p>The young Seb was of a nervous and sensitive disposition and his father had decided it was time to instil purpose and determination in the boy. Seb duly got his O-levels and along the way also discovered a passion and talent for running.</p> <p>At 14 Seb won the Yorkshire County 1500m title with a time of 4min 31sec, a performance that his father saw as sowing a seed for future greatness. Coe senior had been a racing cyclist in his youth but had no coaching background. He was a trained engineer, though, and had an analytical brain.</p> <p>He studied the basic concepts of coaching and bio-mechanics and produced a training plan he believed would have his son running the same distance in 3:30, five seconds under the then world record, and winning the gold medal at the 1980 Olympics, which were then 10 years away. Unburdened by preconceived ideas, he prescribed a training regime of low mileage, but high intensity.</p> <p>He added hill training, making Seb run repeatedly up the steep Yorkshire hills, but meeting him at the top and driving him down, so that his bones and joints would not be stressed by the pounding downhill. The result was a technical style of graceful perfection and a final-lap kick of devastating acceleration.</p> <p>Peter's attitude to life was forged by the fact, that aged 19, he had been on a merchant navy boat torpedoed in the Atlantic during the Second World War and was one of only five survivors picked up by the Germans, who put him to work in the kitchen because he spoke fluent German.</p> <p>He later escaped when he jumped off a train on his way to being sent to a prisoner of war camp and walked through the day and night to Spain, where he was put in jail for six months because he did not have the right documentation. Feared dead by his family, he did not return to England until he was in his early 20s.</p> <p>Parental support is not uncommon in the sporting world, but the difference in Peter's approach lay in his reliance on the experts. When he felt that he lacked the right skills for his son's training he turned to the professionals, the result being that Peter surrounded himself with a team of highly qualified staff and subsequently approached competition with a military precision. But, as Seb already knew from the pep talk he had been given by his father when he was 11, Peter was not a man to hold back when something needed to be said. So when Seb started like a tortoise in the final of the 800m at the Moscow Olympics in 1980 and was beaten by his great rival Steve Ovett, Peter told him exactly how he thought he had run. 'First is first, second is nowhere,' Coe senior told the press. Seb later acknowledged that it helped spur him to redeem himself a few days later by winning the 1500m.</p> <p>When I interviewed Peter Coe 18 years ago, after Seb had retired from athletics, he told me: 'There is nothing revolutionary in what I have done with Seb, but it has been tailor-made for his physique. The coach must adjust to his athlete. When Seb was 14, I knew he was good; at 16, I had a strange kind of certainty that if I was patient I had a world beater.'</p> <p>Seb remained extremely close to his father - whom he called by his Christian name - even when they no longer had running to bond them. Peter had grown increasingly frail and was losing his sight and every Sunday, when he was at home, Seb used to go round to his house to read him the Sunday Telegraph and the Spectator. Seb recalled his father - a man of strongly held opinions, - once having a fierce row with a British athletics official. Seb said: 'Afterwards I said to him, \"You don't scare easily.\"</p> <p>'[He replied] \"I don't scare at all. The past 45 years have been a fucking bonus.\"</p> <p>'That fearlessness made him a great man to have in your corner.'</p>",
  "<p>China's winning start to the Olympics was overshadowed yesterday by the murder of a relative of the US men's volleyball coach.</p> <p>A knife-wielding Chinese man stabbed to death Todd Bachman, the father of former Olympian Elisabeth Bachman. He then attacked a Chinese tour guide before throwing himself from the 40 metre-high viewing platform of the Drum Tower, one of Beijing's most famous tourist spots. Mr Bachman's wife, Barbara, was also injured in the early afternoon attack. Elisabeth Bachman is married to US men's volleyball coach Hugh McCutcheon. </p> <p>Such a murderous assault is extremely rare in Beijing, which has a low crime rate compared to most cities of its size.</p> <p>State media identified the killer as Tang Yongming, a 47-year-old native of Hangzhou in the south-eastern province of Zhejiang. His motive is unknown, but local law authorities described him as a lone assailant.</p> <p>The crime put a damper on the festivities, which had come to life after Friday's spectacular opening ceremony and a strong start for the host nation, which won two golds on day one. 'They are deeply saddened and shocked,' the US Olympic Committee spokesman Darryl Seibel said of the volleyball team. He said the two Americans 'were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of the delegation or as Americans'.</p> <p>The crime scene was quickly cleared by police. By mid-afternoon the green gates of the Drum Tower - normally a popular site - were locked. Through the rails all that was visible was a sanded area on the grey tiled floor where bystanders said the police had previously covered a body with a blanket.</p> <p>'I heard a woman screaming and then people running in the direction where the screams came from. It sounded like the screams came from the top of the Drum Tower,' said a foreigner who was in the area.</p> <p>Chinese residents who lived and worked close to the scene of the crime appeared to be under orders not to discuss the incident. 'Why are you paying so much attention to this? Murders happen all the time. You should pay attention to the two gold medals that China won today,' said a middle-aged woman in a flower-patterned shirt.</p> <p>Last night, a series of blasts killed at least two people in China's north-western Xinjiang province, state media reported. It said that sporadic gunfire was heard shortly after the explosions and that two Muslim suspects had been detained. Earlier this week, 16 Chinese policemen were killed in an attack on a border post in the province.</p> <p>Beijing has drafted in an extra 100,000 police and paramilitaries to ensure security at the event, which China hopes to use to highlight its re-emergence as a global power. But sporadic, small-scale protests continue to deflect attention from the sporting spectacle.</p> <p>On the opening day, five pro-Tibet activists draped themselves in Tibetan flags and lay down on Tiananmen Square in protest at the Chinese government's heavy-handed rule in Tibet. They were dragged away by plainclothes police officers. </p> <p>At the start of the equestrian events in Hong Kong, police removed a student from the crowd after she tried to display a Tibetan flag that had been concealed beneath a Canadian banner.</p> <p>Following the precedent set by previous hosts, the organisers in Beijing have established three protest zones. But no one appears to have used them, and two groups of protesters who tried to do so were reportedly either forced to leave Beijing or detained by police.</p> <p>Concerns about human rights violations have been strengthened by the disappearance of activist Zeng Jinyan, who has not been seen since last Thursday when the Olympic torch passed close to her home. Since Zeng's husband, Hu Jia, was jailed earlier this year, she and their eight-month-old baby have been under constant watch by the authorities. </p> <p>In her last blog, Zeng said that she was under extra surveillance before the Games and asked friends to stay away. When The Observer tried to call, her phone was out of service.</p> <p>'All attempts to contact her have failed. It is feared that Zeng has been taken into police custody and might be mistreated,' China Human Rights Defenders said. Another prominent activist, Maggie Hou, has also been out of touch for several days.</p> <p>Human rights disputes and security concerns have taken some of the shine off the lavish celebrations and warm welcome from local people. Before the Games, the organisers forecast that the spectacle would draw 500,000 foreign visitors, generating hundreds of millions of dollars for hotels, restaurants and taxi firms.</p> <p>But a tightening of visa regulations, security concerns and negative reports about pollution appear to have discouraged many people from attending.</p>",
  "<p>There were no medals in Beijing for the United Kingdom Olympic team yesterday, but a truly special result in the men's gymnastics just about made up for that. For the first time in living memory, Britain's male gymnasts have reached an Olympic final; four years ago they hadn't even made the grade to travel to Athens.</p> <p>What made the result even more incredible was the fact that neither Louis Smith, nor Daniel Keatings - both teenagers, at 17 Keatings is the youngest gymnast in the competition - were even expected to compete in this Olympic cycle, having been earmarked for London 2012.</p> <p>Smith qualified for the pommel horse final as one of eight gymnasts competing next Sunday where, after winning bronze in last year's world championships, he has a good chance of a medal; while Keatings clinched the last spot for the esteemed all-round individual final.</p> <p>Their achievements were in sharp contrast to the rest of the day's British results. Judo's gold medal hope Craig Fallon crashed out of the competition to finish in seventh place, while Britain's men's road race cyclists were forced to withdraw from the event, complaining about the heat and humidity.</p> <p>Elsewhere on the opening day of competition, Katerina Emmons won the first gold, in the women's 10-metre air rifle, for the Czech Republic. Pre-Games favourite Du Li of China finished fifth and left in tears. </p> <p>Pang Wei restored home pride in the shooting with victory in the men's 10-metre air pistol, the second gold for China after Chen Xiexia won the women's 48kg weightlifting. </p> <p>In the first event to test athletes' ability to withstand the heat and smog of a Beijing summer, Spain's Samuel Sanchez won the men's cycling road race along a gruelling 245km route from the Forbidden City in Beijing to the Great Wall. </p> <p>More than a third of contestants dropped out, including favourites like German Stefan Schumacher, who said the humidity and smog made a hard course even tougher. </p> <p>Tennis officials said they may allow heat breaks during matches to help players cope with stifling humidity and heat in the high 90s fahrenheit (above 35C). In dressage, medal hope William Pitt Fox made a disappointing start to the competition with a sixth-place finish. But in the pool Hannah Miley qualified for the 400m individual medley final, and on the water Ben Ainslie and the women's sailing team both recovered from poor starts to finish third and second respectively.</p>",
  "<p>Britain is gasping in sympathy with Linda Buchanan, the hapless Kent commuter who was pushed on to a railway track by two men she had 'ticked off' for smoking. Everyone is shaken by the idea of this ghastly, nightmarish experience. We are all standing closer to walls as we wait for trains. Poor, terrified Linda Buchanan.</p> <p>Having said that ... On a bad day, I'd have shoved her off the platform myself.</p> <p>Of course, this is a horrible story. But not just because there are people who push other people on to railway tracks. This was not a meeting of good and evil. It was a meeting of bad and worse.</p> <p>Mrs Buchanan, who was helped off the track with a hurt wrist, has been hailed as a hero in the press. Shouting at the smokers, she did 'what any good citizen might do'. She is 'a woman unafraid to intervene when something is wrong'. She 'highlights what ordinary people risk by confronting thugs'.</p> <p>Bollocks. This woman is not a Ben Kinsella (stabbed to death trying to break up a street brawl) or a Philip Lawrence (killed trying to protect the children at St George's school, where he was headmaster, from a gang of bullies), although one newspaper had the tasteless nerve to compare her to both. Mrs Buchanan wasn't being a hero, she was being a busybody.</p> <p>People who step in when others are being attacked or threatened are not aiming purely to uphold the law. That's why it's so pointless and unhelpful for the police to advise us 'not to take the law into our own hands' in these situations. It is not about the law. It is what the law's about. Social responsibility, morality, right and wrong. If you see somebody in danger, you don't just walk past and leave them to their fate. Legal, illegal, who cares; it's morally wrong to ignore someone who is terrified, alone and needs help.</p> <p>Easy for me to say, as a woman. I have twice got involved in situations where I thought somebody was about to get hurt - or, at least, was being terrorised - once when a biker was thumping on a female motorist's car after a skirmish at a traffic light, and once when a man in the street was trying to yank a baby from the arms of a woman (I assume his wife) and she was literally screaming for help.</p> <p>It's much easier for a woman to walk up and try to calm the situation; you do it in the fairly confident assumption that you're not about to get attacked yourself. If it happens, it happens (better than going home, putting the kettle on and idly wondering if anyone got murdered), but in my experience so far it hasn't. This is statistically more dangerous for men. My father was always a one for: 'Leave that woman alone!' and: 'Give you my wallet? You'll have to kill me first!' and I hated it. I thought, one day, someone might.</p> <p>Philip Lawrence and Ben Kinsella, and all men who put themselves at risk to protect others, are heroes. Not so a commuter who bustles up to unleash the sharp end of her tongue on a guy having a quiet cigarette while he waits for a train. He's not the bully; she is.</p> <p>Non-smokers have won, do you understand? We, the weak and addicted, with our revolting habit, who will waste money and lose lovers and die young in our stupid helpless pursuit of small nicotine comforts, have lost the war. You, the strong and healthy and pure, have taken all your land back: you've got the aeroplanes, the cinemas, the theatres, the restaurants, the pubs, you've got the inside of the whole world.</p> <p>And we stand outside, cold and miserable and addicted and embarrassed, on the naughty step, hunched over our desperate little 'treats'... and still you come scurrying over to shout at us. Outside railway stations, in the street, outside restaurants on the three days a year we can comfortably eat there; you lean across to revel in your power, demonstrate your superior self-denial, and tell us how disgusting we are. The powerful sneering at the losers.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Mrs Buchanan, she picked the wrong victim. She inadvertently ticked off someone truly horrible, who exacted the inexcusable revenge of pushing her off the platform a couple of days later. Appalling, indefensible, I hope the police catch up with the man, or men, and throw away the key. (Assuming they have locked some sort of door with it first.) But that doesn't make Linda Buchanan right.</p> <p>Have you seen the train platform at Farningham Road, Swanley? It's a great long stretch, completely open to the sky. It is a huge, airy Serengeti of space. Mrs Buchanan might just as well have trekked across the Sahara, shouting criticism through a megaphone at a distant farting nomad.</p> <p>Since we have a priggish, disapproving, bullying, absolutist government, which refused to bring in a (good, correct) smoking ban by stages, the Farningham smokers were technically breaking the law even by having a crafty snout on an outdoor platform. But why was this Mrs Buchanan's problem? Anyone who didn't like it could have moved further down, in the fresh air. Nobody was getting hurt but the smokers themselves. They weren't breaking the Ten Commandments.</p> <p>There's nothing heroic about 'ticking off' a smoker whose air you're not obliged to share. That's like 'ticking someone off' for parking on a yellow line, or for swearing in a private conversation: not doing something right, but something self-righteous. It is done by those who look around the world in smug disapproval of everything, who make personal remarks, who bitch and criticise, who feel superior. It's rude.</p> <p>Poor Linda Buchanan, who suffered such a horrible assault. I'm very glad she is on the mend. But I'm even gladder that she doesn't live next door to me.</p>",
  "<p>So, was that picture of Beyonc\u00e9, looking sultry and wide-eyed as she poses for a L'Or\u00e9al advert, doctored to make her skin look lighter? The company itself swears blind that it wasn't.</p> <p>But whatever the truth of the past week's headlines, the whole episode has underlined that for millions of people, skin colour is still a contentious issue.</p> <p>It matters in Bangladesh, where some elderly women still tell their granddaughters to avoid tea lest it make their faces darken; it matters in Kenya, where a friend bemoans the fact that the 'beautiful' (read pale) are always the ones who make it as television stars.</p> <p>It matters across southern Africa - in Malawi, Zambia, Botswana and beyond - where village stores line up skin-lightening products alongside the staple offerings of sweets, bottles of pop and razors.</p> <p>And I know that it matters greatly in India, my country of origin, where wedding adverts include a request for 'complexion', with 'fair' counting as good and 'very fair' as excellent. In a country where skin colour has become a multi-million-pound industry, there is even a word for those that are not quite white enough to be deemed light-skinned, but not too dark either: they are called 'wheatish'.</p> <p>There is also a Unilever product that promises 'total fairness'. Known as a 'power brand' because of its enormous sales, Fair and Lovely parades its products through clips that show women applying the cream, turning a paler shade of brown and then miraculously transforming into \u00fcber-successful film stars overnight.</p> <p>In one, a woman hoping to become a television presenter, says: 'Just before my fourth interview, I realised that the obstacle to obtaining my dream job was my skin colour.'</p> <p>There is no question that the adverts make me feel uncomfortable; that they make me think that there must be something inherently racist and oppressive about this trend; that they imply that people in India are more likely to be successful if they are pale - but this is a complex issue.</p> <p>For example, just how does the deep desire among people in India, Pakistan, Kenya, Malawi and beyond to be fair compare to the desperation among Brits, Americans, Europeans and Australians to tan their skin - sometimes until it is leathery and brown?</p> <p>And what makes bleaching the surface of your face until the colour fades away worse than injecting Botox into the muscles beneath to prevent movement and wrinkles; having a surgeon fracture your bones in order to straighten your nose; or getting someone to suck out the fat in your stomach and thighs? Striving to be beautiful is a global phenomenon - should skin-lightening be seen as any different?</p> <p>I'm not sure, but to me this trend matters. Because the inherent assumption when people pile on these products is that being white is somehow more beautiful than being brown, and that, in turn, is preferable to being black.</p> <p>As well as becoming a race issue, that also makes it a class issue. In India, for instance, the people of the lower castes are almost always darker-skinned than those of higher ones.</p> <p>And the notion that 'fair is better' is so ingrained in some communities that, when I asked an Asian friend why it was, they responded: 'Because people who are fair are 80 per cent more beautiful.' The same person winces if I allow myself to go dark in the sun and once boasted that their relative's new fianc\u00e9e was 'very light-skinned'.</p> <p>Another friend described how important skin-colour was to her Bangladeshi in-laws. When she was pregnant, they encouraged her to drink milk and avoid dark foods and tea to give the baby the best chance of being fair. Her (quite pale) father-in-law, meanwhile, argued that it was his 'good genes' that would ensure the baby was not too dark. Another family, originally from Kolkata in India, talked about how one set of siblings were all different shades because of the mother's eating behaviour during each pregnancy.</p> <p>I think it is worrying that people think this issue is so important, but there is no denying that - in showbusiness, at least - it does affect people's chances of employment.</p> <p>Scour the internet for images of black women chosen to appear in hip-hop or rap videos - they are far more likely to be fair-skinned than dark. Black actresses and singers who are considered the most beautiful are also often fairer - such as Beyonc\u00e9 or Halle Berry.</p> <p>But perhaps the tide is turning. Women with darker skin are certainly becoming more prevalent among the world's supermodels and when Italian Vogue recently published a 'black edition', it caused such phenomenal demand that Cond\u00e9 Nast printed an extra 40,000 copies.</p> <p>In India, meanwhile, Bipasha Basu is a hugely successful Bollywood actress and model - that is despite thinking that she was ugly as a child because her skin was (very slightly) darker than some of the models of the time. </p> <p>Basu, whose complexion is often described as 'dusky', has won the title of 'India's Most Desirable Woman'. It is worth adding, however, that, while she is described as a successful star with slightly darker skin, most of the images of her still appear quite pale.</p> <p>As for the Beyonc\u00e9 furore, L'Or\u00e9al has issued a statement saying it is 'categorically untrue' that the company altered her features or skin tone. Meanwhile, her Hollywood publicist, Alan Nierob, added: 'There is no doubt that anyone seeing that ad will know that it is Beyonc\u00e9.' </p> <p>To me, there is no doubt that, at the very least, the lighting of the picture makes her look light-skinned. Whether that was conscious or not it, the image is likely to strengthen the impression - at least slightly - that pale is beautiful.</p> <p>Now is the time to start realising that as well as not judging people on the colour of their skin, we should not judge them on the shade of their skin. But perhaps that is as forlorn as hoping that one day we stop judging each other on looks at all.</p>",
  "<p>I'm not supposed to say exactly where - and the few doubtless monitored mobile conversations have been full of cryptic initials, 'up theres' and 'back heres' - but my brother-in-law is serving in Iraq. Odds are that at some point he's been to Falluja, four years ago the scene of the some of the bloodiest fighting in the theatre, these days a relatively stable zone, but, more to the point here, the setting (or close to it) for the overseas sections of Gregory Burke's Black Watch, an unexpected National Theatre of Scotland smash which has gone on to win even more surprising international acclaim.</p> <p>The surprise has nothing to do with the play's intrinsic merits, which are considerable and well known. Packed with vivid language, extraordinarily authentic military set-pieces, cinematic transitions and, according to every Fifer who watched the play return to its 'native' soil, a deep feel for the men who make up the regiment.</p> <p>What's surprising is twofold. First, given how demilitarised society is supposed to have become since the abolition of National Service and the post-Cold War shrinking of the military and how morally uncomfortable we have become about foreign entanglements, it is interesting that Burke's play has had such a profound resonance. Second, it is frankly astonishing that the play should be considered damaging enough to the military establishment for the army itself to sponsor a kind of response to it and put it on at the Fringe.</p> <p>At a time when men are still going into action inadequately equipped, the army has spent more than a quarter of a million pounds on The Pipers' Trail. At one level, it looks like a good investment, given the suggestion that four million people have been 'reached' (whatever that exactly means) by the play. The army isn't suggesting that The Pipers' Trail, a relatively generic story by all accounts of a young man finding his way in life through exposure to core army values, is a recruiting poster; rather, that it attempts to redress the 'negativity' of Black Watch and a piece of agitprop called Deep Cut.</p> <p>There are questions one might ask about a regiment established to 'watch' the Highlands and some of whose deeds were darker than its tartan, but that isn't what Burke's play is about.</p> <p>It's a pungently powerful drama about men together and the impact of their togetherness on their several selves, their families and everyone else - friends and foes - they come into contact with as soldiers.</p> <p>Far from worrying about and responding to what's unmistakably a powerful piece of drama, the army might better consider making it required watching at staff college.</p> <p>At one level, our interest in these plays is unsurprising. Black Watch and Deep Cut deal with closed systems and restricted spaces. An army barracks is like a ship, a spacecraft or a courtroom: an ideal narrative space. At another, though, it reflects the unavoidable fact that we remain dependent - awkwardly, unwillingly, diffidently dependent - on the army and the other armed forces. </p> <p>In a society that provides few other meaningful challenges for young men and women, the army still holds them out. Its ethos and rituals are often deeply questionable - Deep Cut's troubling questions still await an adequate response - but they hold us in a very particular way. There's a reason why the Tattoo is packed out every night.</p> <p>With The Pipers' Trail, the army has made a serious tactical mistake, counter-attacking when there was no broad-front attack. The army seems unreasonably touchy and trigger-happy. Better, surely, to have spent some of that money on boots and body armour.</p>",
  "<p>Georgia today declared itself at war as Russian planes bombed a Georgian city in an escalation of the conflict over South Ossetia. Moscow claims the fighting has killed more than 2,000 people.</p> <p>As the neighbouring countries edged closer to a full-scale conflict over their conflicting claims and allegiances to the territory, Britain was among a number of countries tonight pressing for an immediate ceasefire in Georgia as part of a high-level international delegation attempting to quell escalating violence in the region.</p> <p>Tonight, Azerbaijan has suspended shipments of oil and oil products from two of Georgia's ports because of the violence, the Azeri state energy firm SOCAR said. The British oil company BP and SOCAR have a production-sharing deal in the Caspian Sea. </p> <p>The British foreign secretary, David Miliband, expressed fears that the conflict over South Ossetia was spreading to other parts of the region with the prospect of \"large scale\" civilian losses.</p> <p>Officials in another breakaway province, Abkhazia, said separatist forces had launched air and artillery strikes to drive Georgian troops out of the small part of the territory they still control. Georgia accused Russia of backing the Abkhazians.</p> <p>The Kremlin said its forces were in control of the South Ossetian capital, Tskhinvali, but Georgian officials denied this. The city is reportedly heavily damaged from Georgian bombardment and heavy fighting.</p> <p>Russian planes today bombed the Georgian city of Gori, near the South Ossetian border, leaving apartment buildings ruined and ablaze. Witnesses reported scores of dead, including children and old people. Tens of thousands more are said to have fled into Russian territory as violence has increased over the last day.</p> <p>Russia's ambassador to Georgia, Vyacheslav Kovalenko, told Interfax that at least 2,000 civilians had died in Tskhinvali alone since Georgia attacked the region on Friday and Russia responded with tanks, air raids and ground troops.</p> <p>The Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, dismissed Russian casualty claims as \"a lie\", saying very few civilians had died.</p> <p>A senior US official described the Russian response in Georgia as \"disproportionate\". Earlier today president George Bush, in Beijing for the Olympic games, spoke to Saakashvili and the Russian president, Dmitri Medvedev, today to urge calm. The Kremlin said Medvedev told Bush the only way to end the conflict would be a withdrawal of Georgian forces.</p> <p>The UK's special representative to the South Caucuses, Sir Brian Fall, was this evening attending emergency talks in Georgia with other officials from the US, European Union, Nato and the Organisation of Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). </p> <p>Moscow supports South Ossetia, which has had de facto independence from Georgia since 1992 after a bloody war. Many people in the region have Russian citizenship. Georgia claims South Ossetia as part of its territory.</p> <p>Addressing a televised meeting today, Saakashvili described the conflict as open warfare. \"I have signed a decree on a state of war. Georgia is in a state of total military aggression,\" he said, while calling for \"an immediate ceasefire\".</p> <p>The decree allows for the mobilisation of reservists, among other measures. Georgia says it plans to remove its entire contingent of 2,000 troops from Iraq so they can assist in South Ossetia.</p> <p>Vladimir Boldyrev, the commander of Russian ground forces, was quoted by Tass as saying Russian troops had \"fully liberated Tskhinvali from the Georgian military\".</p> <p>Georgia, which said today it had downed 10 Russian aircraft and destroyed up to 30 tanks, maintains it is holding Tskhinvali. Witnesses in the city said they could only see Russian forces.</p> <p>Russia \u2013 which has confirmed the loss of two planes \u2013 says it first sent tanks and artillery to Tskhinvali to prevent Georgian forces attacking Russian peacekeepers and civilians.</p> <p>Aside from the regional impact, the fighting threatens to increase tensions between Russia and the US. Georgia is a close American ally and Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said the US must bear some of the blame for arming and training Georgian soldiers.</p> <p>Bush, speaking before heading to watch the US women's basketball team in Beijing, said he was \"deeply concerned about the situation\", notably Russia's bombing inside Georgia.</p> <p>\"The attacks are occurring in regions of Georgia far from the zone of conflict in South Ossetia,\" he said. \"They mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis.</p> <p>\"We call for an end to the Russian bombings.\"</p> <p>At the United Nations last night, Russian and Georgian envoys hurled accusations at each other as a divided security council failed to agree on language calling for an end to the fighting. Holding its second emergency meeting in under 12 hours, the council broke off in a stalemate late but was to reconvene today.</p> <p>There are fears of full-blown war in the region, which is a crucial energy transit route in which Russia and the west are vying for influence. </p> <p>In Abkhazia, which declared independence from Georgia but is still claimed by Tiblisi, Sergei Shamba, the region's foreign minister, said its forces intended to oust Georgian forces from the Kodori Gorge. The northern part of the gorge is the only area of Abkhazia that has remained under Georgian government control.</p>",
  "<p>China's winning start to the Olympics was partially overshadowed today by a murder-suicide involving a relative of the US men's volleyball coach.</p> <p>A knife-wielding Chinese man fatally stabbed an American man and his female Chinese tour guide before throwing himself off the 40m-high viewing platform of the Drum Tower, one of Beijing's most famous tourist spots.</p> <p>The dead man's wife was seriously injured in the early afternoon attack - an extremely unusual occurrence in Beijing, which has a low crime rate compared to most cities of its size.</p> <p>US officials identified the dead man as Todd Bachman. His wife, Barbara, was injured. They are the parents of former US Olympian Elisabeth Bachman, who represented the country at volleyball in 2004 and is married to the current US men's volleyball coach, Hugh McCutcheon.</p> <p>State-media named the killer as Tang Yongming, a 47-year-old native of Hangzhou in the south-eastern province of Zhejiang. His motive is unknown, but local law authorities described him as a lone assailant.</p> <p>The crime put a damper on the festivities, which came to life with yesterday's spectacular opening ceremony and a strong start for China today, winning two gold medals.</p> <p>\"They are deeply saddened and shocked,\" the US Olympic committee spokesman Darryl Seibel said of the volleyball team.</p> <p>He said the two Americans \"were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation\" or as Americans.</p> <p>The crime scene was quickly cleared by police. By mid afternoon, the green gates of the Drum Tower - normally a popular tourist site - were locked. Through the rails, all that was visible was a sanded area on the sloping, grey tiled floor where bystanders said the body had lain, covered by a police blanket. </p> <p>\"I heard a woman screaming and then people running in the direction where the screams came from. It sounded like the screams came from the top of the Drum Tower,' said a foreigner who was in the area.</p> <p>Chinese residents who live and work within a few seconds walk from the scene of the crime, appeared to be under orders not to discuss the incident.</p> <p>\"Why are you paying so much attention to this. Murders happen all the time. You should pay attention to the two gold medals that China won today,\" said a middle-aged woman in a floral-patterned shirt. Beijing has drafted in an extra 100,000 police and paramilitaries to ensure security at the Olympics, which China hopes to use to highlight its re-emergence as a global power.</p> <p>But sporadic, small-scale protests continue to deflect attention from the sporting spectacle.</p> <p>On the opening day, five pro-Tibet activists draped themselves in Tibetan flags and lay down on Tiananmen Square in protest at the Chinese government's heavy-handed rule. They were swiftly dragged away by plain-clothes police officers.</p> <p>At the start of the equestrian events in Hong Kong, police removed a student in the crowd after she tried to display a Tibetan flag that she had concealed beneath a Canadian banner.</p> <p>Following the precedent set by previous hosts, the organisers in Beijing have established three protest zones, but nobody appears to have used them. Two groups of those who tried to do so were reportedly either forced to leave Beijing or detained by police.</p> <p>Concerns about human rights violations have been strengthened by the disappearance of activist Zeng Jinyan, who has not been seen since Thursday, when the Olympic torch passed close to her home.</p> <p>Since Zeng's husband, Hu Jia, was jailed earlier this year, she and their eight-month-old baby have been under constant watch by the authorities. In her last blog post, Zeng said she was under extra surveillance ahead of the games and asked friends to stay away. </p> <p>\"All attempts to contact her have failed. It is feared that Zeng has been taken into police custody and might be mistreated,\" China Human Rights Defenders said. Another prominent activist, Maggie Hou, has also been out of touch for several days.</p> <p>Human rights disputes and security concerns have taken some of the shine off the lavish celebration and warm welcome by local people. Ahead of the games, organisers forecast the lavish spectacle would draw 500,000 foreign visitors, generating hundreds of millions of dollars of business for hotels, restaurants and taxi firms.</p> <p>But a tightening of visa regulations, security concerns and negative reports about pollution appear to have discouraged many people from coming.</p> <p>\"It's as though we spent a long time preparing a big feast, and then nobody turned up to eat it,\" said a local taxi driver, as she surveyed the unusually empty roads and complained about the lack of customers.</p>",
  "<p>Protesters entered the Kingsnorth coal-fired power station but failed to shut it down today as the climax of the week-long climate camp passed off unexpectedly peacefully.</p> <p>There were minor skirmishes with the police and only a handful of protesters succeeded in getting inside the site in Kent, near Rochester. </p> <p>Climate camp organisers said that about 1,500 people took part in the day of direct action and marches. They were matched by nearly an equal numbers police officers. </p> <p>The only serious scuffles came when a group of 70 people tried to enter a cornfield and were met by 100 police, some of whom used batons. Several people were injured. </p> <p>Police also used horses, dogs, trail bikes and helicopters to control demonstrators approaching the power station across fields and down country lanes. </p> <p>Environmentalists are targeting Kingsnorth because its owner, the German energy group E.ON, want to build a new coal plant there - the UK's first for nearly 30 years. Companies could build a further six more coal plants if Kingsnorth gets the go-ahead, making it almost impossible for the UK to meet its carbon emissions targets. </p> <p>Ten protesters commandeered crowd control barriers to scale the southern perimeter fence of the power station. \"A new coal station here would be a climate disaster. It could emit more greenhouse gases than Heathrow Airport,\" said Madeleine, one of the protesters trying to scale the fence.<br>Four people are believed to have crossed the marshy land between the fences and scaled the second, electrified, security fence. They were immediately detained by police officers with dogs. </p> <p>A climate camp spokeswoman also claimed that more than 20 boats and rafts were launched on the Medway river despite a ban by local port authority. \"Most did not get far but two reached the power station and the crew of one also got over the perimeter fence,\" she said.</p> <p>\"It was a total success. We stopped any coal getting to the station and disrupted its operation. If the government gives the go ahead for a new plant we will be back to stop it. This is not a symbolic protest.\"</p> <p>While a minority tried to get into Kingsnorth, about 1,000 protesters, including many families with children, formed a carnival-like procession to walk the three miles from the climate camp to the main gate of the plant. <br>They arrived just before midday when the mood was dampened as it began to rain heavily. Police and coastguard helicopters hovered over the area all day. </p> <p>A great cheer went up as protesters hoisted a banner saying \"No new coal\" on the main gates of the power station when they arrived. </p> <p>Five mock \"suspect: wanted\" boards were also hung up on the gates with a silhouette of a person on each accompanied by the names of five key people involved in plans to build the new plant: Gordon Brown, the energy minister Malcolm Wicks, the business secretary John Hutton and two senior E.ON executives. </p> <p>Mock police tape was also draped around the gates saying \"climate crime scene\". </p> <p>About 150 police looked on from behind crash barriers as speakers gave passionate addresses and protesters sat down for a picnic. </p> <p>Malcolm Hunter, from Leicester, who was dressed in an orang-utan suit, said: \"This protest is about raising awareness. Hopefully it will put pressure on government not to approve new coal plants.\"</p> <p>Shortly before lunch, the sound system cranked up \"I've been loving you too long\" by Otis Redding when the police helicopter circled and a loud speaker announced: \"This is a police warning. Please disperse in 10 minutes or police horses, dogs and police batons will be used.\"</p> <p>Organisers said that the rally only had permission to remain outside the gate until 1pm, and the protesters packed up and turned back towards the camp without any trouble. </p> <p>Curious locals watched on as the action unfolded. Vic Mortley, 75, from Hoo village and who service in the RAF, said: 'I don't want any part of the protest. We have lived with coal for 75 years. Are we aware of what coal is really doing - can we see the carbon emissions in the air?\"</p> <p>Other locals were on the side of the protesters. Jo Barrett, from Stoke village, said: \"Opinions are roughly divided. There's plenty of water round here. There must be a cleaner way of generating electricity.\"<br></p>",

  "<p>A Chinese man stabbed the relative of a US Olympic team coach to death in Beijing today and seriously injured another family member and her guide before committing suicide, officials said. </p> <p>The man, whose relative coaches the men's volleyball team, died \"during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant\", US Olympic officials in Beijing said in a statement, giving no further details.</p> <p>The attack took place on the first full day of the Olympics, at one of the capital's most popular attractions. </p> <p>The assailant, believed to be Tang Yongming, 47, struck at the Drum Tower in north Beijing shortly after noon. The man was killed outright while the female relative and her Chinese tour guide were rushed to hospital. A member of staff at the hospital said their condition was not yet clear but the US Olympic statement said the American woman's injuries were serious.</p> <p>Tang, from Hangzhou in eastern Zhejiang province, then leapt from the 13th century tower. He was identified by an ID card found on his body, the Beijing municipal government said in a statement. </p> <p>Darryl Seibel, a spokesman for the US Olympic committee, said the two Americans \"were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation\" or as Americans.</p> <p>He added that the volleyball team were \"deeply saddened and shocked\" and said that it was too early to say whether the US delegation or athletes would require additional security.</p> <p>The White House said that President George Bush, who is in Beijing for the opening days of the games, had been informed. The administration has offered the families of the victims assistance.</p> <p>Emmanuelle Moreau, spokeswoman for the International Olympic<br>Committee, said it was speaking to games organisers to find out full<br>details of the incident, and would provide whatever assistance it<br>could.</p> <p>Police rushed to the scene after receiving an emergency call and closed off the area with yellow tape. Security officers were examining the scene on the tower and below.<br> <br>Attacks on foreigners are extremely rare in China, not least because they carry heavier punishment than crimes against Chinese people. </p> <p>Beijing has relatively low crime levels compared to other major world cities and is under particularly intense security because of the Olympics. </p> <p>The government has drafted in tens of thousands of extra police and troops \u2013 as well as volunteer wardens \u2013 in its determination to prevent protests, terrorism and other threats during the Olympics.</p> <p>In a further \u2013 if more anticipated \u2013 blow to Beijing Olympic officials, the first full day of sport following last night's spectacular opening ceremony was marked by a series of protests.</p> <p>On Tiananmen Square in central Beijing a small group of pro-Tibet activists wrapped themselves in Tibetan flags and lay down. The five protestors were swiftly dragged away by plain-clothes police officers.</p> <p>In Hong Kong, where the games' equestrian events are taking place, a student in the crowd for the first day of competition was removed after trying to display a Tibetan flag.</p> <p>The student, named as Christina Chan, was sitting in the front row with a Canadian flag. When she tried to peel away that flag to reveal a Tibetan emblem beneath, security officers covered her with a cloth and asked her to leave. They carried her out of the venue after she refused to go of her own free will.</p> <p>Activists have promised to use the global focus on China during the games to highlight the country's abuses of civil and religious freedoms, particularly in Tibet.</p> <p>Beijing has ruled the Himalayan territory, which it claims as an integral part of China, for more than 50 years.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>James will be here from 10.45am. He's here already (none of this shortly stuff), but is currently sorting an Olympics betting poll involving a rat which goes by the name of Balco. The lucky man. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/poll/2008/aug/08/olympics2008.swimming\">Said poll</a>.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Match status</strong> Good morning, everyone. South Africa are 37-1 in their second innings, still trailing England by 85.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Weather update</strong> The early blue skies above London have been replaced by a cool breeze and a generous helping of threatening cloud cover. According to the Guardian's weather page, rain is hotfooting it towards south London as we speak. Oh, according to Botham in the middle of the pitch, it's just started to spit.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Rain update</strong> Upgrade that 'spit' to tipping it down. Play has subsequently and inevitably been delayed.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>\"It's a shame that cricket isn't played in the rain,\"</strong> chimes Gary Naylor. \"Once every four years, the Olympics reminds us that in sports played on water, us Brits tend to do well. Pretty useful at anything involving horses too, but the hoof marks outside off stump may interest the umpires.\" Better news from The Oval, where the rain is abating and the groundstaff are in action. We're now due for an 11.30am start.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>\"Re: Gary Naylor's witterings</strong> about the Olympics and other suggestions about Twenty20 being considered as a sport for the 2012 Olympic Games,\" begins Thomas Lawrence. \"Cricket was contested at the Summer Games once before, in 1900: a two-day game between two 12-man sides, one British, one French. They were apparently unaware they were they were even in the Olympics.\" Indeed it was, Thomas: <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Cricket_1900.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Cricket_1900.jpg&amp;h=398&amp;w=300&amp;sz=65&amp;tbnid=N_ZgWyVLCfsJ::&amp;tbnh=124&amp;tbnw=93&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3Dcricket%2B1900%2BOlympics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=image&amp;cd=1\">here's the poster</a> advertising it. Anyway, what does everybody think: does cricket warrant a place in London, in 2012?</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>10th over: South Africa 39-1 (McKenzie 10, Amla 27)</strong> Steve Harmison gets the action started after the 30-minute delay and his first delivery of the day almost gets a wicket, just as it nearly did on day one. Amla gets tied up and almost plays on, chopping down <em>this</em> close behind his stumps and running away for a single. McKenzie then stonewalls the next three deliveries, before playing downwards towards third slip, and dropping short for a scampered single.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>11th over: South Africa 41-1 (McKenzie 11, Amla 28)</strong> Jimmy Anderson looks for some early swing, keeping the batsmen on their toes. Each takes a quick single and the deficit is now 81.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>12th over: South Africa 42-1 (McKenzie 11, Amla 29)</strong> Just the single to Amla off Harmison's latest. \"Morning James.\" Morning Clare Davies. \"Shame about the rain. Tipping it down here in north-east Scotland too. I think I read/heard somewhere that the French team in that Olympic match was actually made up of Englishmen from the Embassy in Paris as the French themselves couldn't field a team. Could be an apocryphal story I suppose, but has a strange ring of truth to it.\" More than a whiff of truth. The French Athletic Club Union team: W. Andersen, W.T. Attrill, J. Braid, W. Browning, R. Horne, T.H. Jordan, Arthur McEvoy, D. Robinson, F. Rogues, A.J. Schneidau, Henry Terry, Philip Tomalin (captain).</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>13th over: South Africa 47-1 (McKenzie 11, Amla 33)</strong> Anderson drops short and wide, enabling Amla to open his shoulders and drive high into the third man area and away for four. A great riposte from Anderson, swinging a beauty away from the batsman, who admittedly pulled out of the stroke just in the nick of time. \"One of the first obstacles to overcome is that for a men's sport to be in the Olympics it must be 'widely played' in 75 countries on four continents,\" reads Rupert Good from some grand Olympics rule book. \"I think we're about 60 countries short. Though if we were going to display cricket to the wider world, we shouldn't fob them off with Twenty20. Give them a marathon round robin Test tournament. That'll sort the Test nations from the boys.\" Hear, hear.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>14th over: South Africa 48-1 (McKenzie 12, Amla 33)</strong> The absolute pearler that Harmison removed Amla with in the first innings must be playing on the batsman's mind; he's keen to leave as much alone as possible from the Durham quick. McKenzie, meanwhile, drops another ball short on the off-side and runs through a single.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>15th over: South Africa 52-1 (McKenzie 16, Amla 33)</strong> Anderson is yet to really find his groove this morning, dropping a little too short of a length and a little too wide. Now McKenzie helps himself to four past backward point. \"Driving to the beach this morning in Dubai, I overtook a three-tonne lorry with the logo 'Solanki Construction Company',\" writes the fascinatingly named iceberg Events. \"I wonder if Vikram has finally realised he is better off in another career instead of being a nearlyman. Plus - Dubai is the place to be for construction.\"</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>16th over: South Africa 60-1 (McKenzie 23, Amla 34)</strong> Far from the most riveting half-hour of this series, though many would say that's unsuprising given McKenzie's involvement. I'm just wondering if the human embodiment of a sleeping pill has had a harsh rap this summer: agreed, he's tough on the eye, but so what: his team have won the series and they wouldn't have won any more if he'd played any more aggressively. Anyway, he finds runs off Harmison after getting a lucky escape with a miscontrolled top-edge down to fine leg. He prods twice through the off-side, beating the field, and rampages, if he can, to 23.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>17th over: South Africa 64-1 (McKenzie 23, Amla 34)</strong> Anderson attempts to catch McKenzie out with an inswinger, but he only succeeds in beating Tim Ambrose as the ball swerves viciously down the leg side and off to the boundary for four byes.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>18th over: South Africa 68-1 (McKenzie 23, Amla 38)</strong> Read 13th over, as Amla climbs all over a short, wide one from Harmison. And we have more rain. \"Re: 13th over. Does that mean that baseball is widely played in 75 countries on four continents?\" wonders Chris Beach. \"Could Rupert Good or anybody clarify? For baseball was an Olympic sport within recent memory. And even now there are some pretty arcane ones. Any ideas for the strangest?\" Well, as the man Bull <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/08/07/the_joy_of_six_great_olympians.html\">explained earlier this week</a>, \"between 1912 and 1948, Olympic medals were awarded for achievement in literature, architecture, music, sculpture and painting, with the caveat that the work had to have been inspired by sport\".</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>19th over: South Africa 77-1 (McKenzie 24, Amla 46)</strong> Anderson comes as close as England have done this morning to a wicket, as Amla gets an inside edge that raps his pad and rolls agonisingly past the stumps. Amla responds by taking advantage of a ball that's just a little too far down leg, clipping it delightfully to the backward square leg boundary. He follows up with another example of great timing, stroking another four past wide long on.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>20th over: South Africa 82-1 (McKenzie 29, Amla 46)</strong> McKenzie rocks on to his back foot and assuredly pulls Harmison to the fine leg boundary. This innings is shaping up much as South Africa's did in their first one; the hope for England is that the tourists collapse as they did from 103-1 on Thursday.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>WICKET! McKenzie 29 b Broad (21st over: South Africa 82-2, Amla 46)</strong> Beginner's luck or another masterstroke? Either way, Kevin Pietersen's first change of bowling for today pays immediate dividends and Stuart Broad bowls McKenzie through the gate. It caught a very slight inside edge off the bat before it clattered into middle stump, but a fine delivery from Broad, all the same.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>22nd over: South Africa 91-2 (Amla 54, Kallis 0)</strong> Here's Jacques Kallis and here's a half-century for Amla, driving Andrew Flintoff to square. It took him just 64 balls and is his ninth Test fifty. And here's Rupert Good, tails between his legs. \"Actually I was wrong: 75 countries is merely the requirement for the IOC to recognise it as a sport, it doesn't guarantee it'll be played at the Games,\" he explains. \"I think they're voting soon on whether to recognise golf as a sport (it's not).\" It blimmin' well is. \"Favourite random Olympic sport was when they included bicycle polo in London 1908. Ireland beat Germany for the gold. Time for a rematch?\"</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>23rd over: South Africa 91-2 (Amla 54, Kallis 0)</strong> A brilliant start to this spell from Broad, who prevents Kallis from getting off the mark with a tight over that's right on the money. \"Baseball has, of course, been dropped as an Olympic sport as of 2012,\" replies Erik Petersen. \"Which is fine, because in Olympic baseball they use these horrible metal bats. Although I was looking forward to seeing exactly how they were planning on dropping a baseball stadium into Hyde Park, which was apparently the plan for 2012. As a fan of both sports, I would point out that while more people play cricket than baseball, baseball is played in many more countries than cricket.\"</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>24th over: South Africa 99-2 (Amla 62, Kallis 0)</strong> Amla is romping along this afternoon, prodding Flintoff through mid-on for four. But then a chance ... an inside edge wrongfoots Ambrose, who reacts brilliantly and dives to his left, getting his fingertips to the ball but putting down the catch. It would have been an amazing take and a hugely important one, both in the contexts of this match and his future in the England Test team. Amla then compounds Flintoff's frustration, with an edge along the ground through third man for another four. The deficit is now down to 23.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>25th over: South Africa 105-2 (Amla 67, Kallis 1)</strong> \"Softball is an Olympic event,\" notes Tom van der Gucht. \"Pretty odd that this sub-standard summer PE lesson filler has made it to the Games. It has a pretty low skill base, basic hand eye co-ordination and a bit of athletic ability running around the pitch. You bowl underarm don't you? Not much in the way of tactics or strokeplay. Why doesn't Britain get a team of cricketers lead by Ed Smith - he has baseball experience - and pack them off for the Games? They'd have as good a chance as anyone else!\" Four more to Amla, who caresses Broad down to the fine leg ropes, and then adds another to cover point.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>26th over: South Africa 108-2 (Amla 69, Kallis 2)</strong> Flintoff changes tack against Amla, bowling short around the wicket, with a fielder at fine leg, but the batsman doesn't bite, leaving the ball well alone and collecting a quick single. \"At what standard does cricket have to be played when it comes to qualifying as an Olympic sport?\" wonders Cliff Challenger. Umm ... \"I have just enjoyed Angus Bell's book, Batting on the Bosphorus, where he mentions the Serbian team who have ambitions to play at the Olympics. He also visited teams in Turkey, Estonia, Poland, Czech Repblic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Belarus, Croatia and Bulgaria. They play cricket in Corfu and I bet there are cricket teams in every former British colony, so it may not be so difficult to reach 75 or whatever the figure is.\" It's still miserably grey and damp around The Oval. It's tipping outside the Farringdon bunker, so they might happily nip off for an early lunch.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>27th over: South Africa 110-2 (Amla 71, Kallis 2)</strong> Lunch arrives as the rain worsens. South Africa go in, trailing by just 12 after a solid morning's work. This Test remains very nicely poised, though the weather could well mean an extended lunch. The final cricket/Olympics word pre-lunch: \"I find it quite difficult to believe that 'individual synchronised swimming' is 'widely played',\" says David Hartman. \"Anywhere. Not even in 75 natatoria, Perhaps not even in one natarorium in each of four continents.\"</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>Wet, wet, wet</strong> It's foul in London and the covers in the background behind Nasser and co suggest we're not going to have much action in the next hour or so, at best.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>In the meantime</strong>, while it continues to pour down in London, can I guide you towards our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/olympics2008\">Olympics site</a>, for the latest news, comment, galleries and more from Beijing.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>I'm sorry to say</strong> that I can't bring you any live action from The Oval as the weather remains truly miserable.

  "<p>Sport has many qualities but none ranks higher than its refusal to bend to the desires of those in charge, and if the organisers of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games were not aware of that fact then they are now.</p> <p>After a stunning opening ceremony, what better way to begin the party than for China to win the first gold, which might explain why, when the competition schedule was drawn up, the women's 10m air rifle was nominated to be the first event of the Games.</p> <p>The sport - a quiet, compelling test of nerve and skill - has been dominated in recent years by Du Li, a 26-year-old student from Shandong who won gold at the 2004 Games in Athens and has collected world championships and world cup victories with startling regularity ever since.</p> <p>She arrived at the shooting hall this morning as favourite and was garlanded on to the stage by the home crowd, with the event itself seemingly nothing but a staging post on her way to the medal podium.</p> <p>Two hours later Du had been vanquished by Katrina Emmons of the Czech Republic, who took gold with an Olympic record score of 503.5, with Lioubov Galina of Russia second and Snjezana Pejcic of Croatia third.</p> <p>Du finished in fifth place with a score of 499.6 - an enormous deficit in a sport where decimal fractions are like tombstones for those who let them slip away. No wonder the Chinese woman was visibly upset as she took the last three of her 10 shots in the final, by which time it was clear her favouritism had turned to dust, and that she would not be taking her designated place as the first winner of the 2008 Games.</p> <p>\"I did well enough in qualifying, but I wasn't fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home,\" Du admitted afterwards, something that the winner acknowledged afterwards to reporters.</p> <p>\"I feel really bad for Du Li, I do - and I'd like to give these flowers to her because she can shoot way better than she did today,\" Emmons said, holding the flowers she was given at the medal ceremony led by IOC president Jacque Rogge.</p> <p>\"The Chinese press is putting a lot of pressure on Chinese athletes,\" Emmons added. \"I had a hard time handling my own pressure. It's obvious to see there's a lot of pressure [on Du] everywhere, every day in training, all around her.</p> <p>\"I feel very lucky. I can't believe it. I have a headache this morning and I was worried about how well I would shoot,\" the winner said. \"Now I have achieved the very best, and I feel amazing - especially since this is the first gold medal of the Games.\"</p> <p>After her victory Emmons' first act was to embrace her husband, the American rifle shooter Matt Emmons. The pair met at the Athens Games, when she commiserated with him after he'd let a gold medal chance slip away by mistakenly shooting at a rival's target. The pair married three years later - a nice Olympic story indeed with which to begin the 2008 Games, even if it was not the story desired by the Chinese hosts.</p>",

Security officers in Hong Kong removed a university student, Christina Chan, who tried to display the Tibetan flag.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>02:45am: </strong>Equestrian dressage, women's shooting, women's volleyball, basketball and handball are already under way. Indeed, Australia lead Belarus 19-12 at the end of the first quarter in the opening women's basketball pool game. Coming up, we've got bouts of boxing that'll make the fighting in opening ceremony director Yimou's <em>Hero</em> look as menacing as Jimmy Carr. And we've balletically brilliant basketball, swimming, volleyball, fencing, beach volleyball, handball and football, that'll make <em>House of Flying Daggers</em> look like the Friday night lovelies falling out on to the Farringdon Road.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>02:58am: </strong> You do worry that all this week's political breast-beating about how Britain was due a massive medal haul will come back to bite us. It certainly left a bad taste, as <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/09/zaras_horse_sense_beats_allcon.html\">David Mitchell</a> so astutely pointed out, in the mouth. William Fox-Pitt scored 50.20 which puts him in at the medal unhopeful position, at this early stage, of 11th.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>03:05am:</strong> Seven golds are on offer today, indeed, we're not so far away from the first gold medal \u2013 the women's 10 meter air rifle. China's Du Li is reigning Olympic champion and the overwhelming favourite \u2013 it would mean so much to the Chinese for her to retain her title. IOC President Jacques Rogge is even due at the shooting range hall to present the medals. The whole nation is wanting and willing it... but at the moment she's running fourth but it's too close to call. </p> <p>Ironically, in Athens, the German favourite, Heiner Gabelmann, buckled under the strain of expectation. will the same happen to Du Li? You simply can't imagine the pressure.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>03:10am: </strong>Back to the women's basketball. Australia are beating Belarus 44-28 at half-time. The Athens silver medalists are on course for an easy victory. Next up in Group A will be Mali against New Zealand, you'd expect New Zealand to win that equally comfortably.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>03:18am: </strong>We don't have a medal yet, but we do have the first athlete to be sent home for failing a drugs test, Greek sprinter Anastasios Gousis, a 200m semi-finalist in Athens four years ago. The Greek Olympic team has already lost 13 members, with 11 weightlifters, a boxer and swimmer Yiannis Drymonakos withdrawn after positive tests in the past three months.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>03:34am: </strong>After the shooting, the second medal up for grabs is in the Women's 48kg weightlifting final - it's a mixture of snatch and clean &amp; jerk lifting methods, with the best total used to determine the final rankings and medal winners. The Turkish phenomenon that is Nurcan Taylan has just entered the competition, failing at 84KG. Astonishing considering that in Athens she set a then world record of 97.5KG. Next we have a strong Thai contingent, with the home favourite, Chen Xiexia, still to come.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>03:40am: </strong>There's a result in the women's beach volleyball. Norway have beaten Belgium 2-0. I'm struggling to picture beach volleyball in Norway, and in truth both nations count as minnows next to the likes of Cuba, Brazil and the United States. Though, of course, as ever in Beijing you can't discount the Chinese.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>03:54am:</strong> Before the shooting final really warms up, let's have a bit of a results and comment round up. In the women's basketball Australia beat Belarus 83-64. Irish fencer Siobhan Claire Byrne lost to Irena Wieckowska in the first round of the Women's Individual Sabre. Lastly, William Fox-Pitt has blamed his horses nerves, after a last minute judge's inspection on his stomach, for his underwhelming performance. \"I'm disappointed,\" said Fox-Pitt. \"He (Parkmore Ed) is capable of a lot better. He seemed very aware of where the exit was and it was hard to keep him concentrated.\"</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>04:01am: Gold medal - women's 10m air rifle: Katerina Emmons (CZE) </strong></p> <p>There is disappointment for China in the shooting as Du Li has failed in her attempt to retain the women's 10m air rifle title, instead the competition was dominated by Katerina Emmons of the Czech Republic who equalled a world record score of 400 in the qualification round. Lioubov Galkina of Russia took Silver and Snjezana Pejcic of Croatia took Bronze. Du Li had to settle for fifth. Better news for China in the weightlifting though, as Chen Xiexia, is taking the opposition to the cleaners.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>04:12am: </strong>More Beijing beginnings, the men's cycling, featuring Tour de France winner Carlos Sastre of Spain, and runner-up Cadel Evans of Australia, are on their 148.5 mile way. In fact, the whole thing is something of a Tour de China, taking in some of the Great Wall of China, Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>04:21am:</strong> Women's handball news. France survived a scare to beat Angola 32-31. I mention this partly because Britain is trying to kick start interest in the sport ahead of the 2012 London Olympics. You can find out more <a href=\"http://britishhandball.worldhandball.com/DesktopDefault.aspx?menuid=1086\">here</a>, just be aware that they want women 5ft 11in or taller and men 6ft 3in or taller. And when I say kick start interest (or whatever the handball equivalent is) I mean they want us to start winning, we're not at the Beijing Games.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>04:30am: </strong> The Olympics is unarguably the biggest sporting spectacle on the planet. For various technological, demographic and political reasons, The Beijing Olympics will probably be the biggest Games ever. Unless you're Sky Sports news, that is. They're focusing on cricket at the Oval (but it's hardly <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/08/theres_no_avoiding_the_pieters.html\">Vic Marks</a>), Arsenal's pre-season victory over Ajax and\u2026 Nottingham Forest V Reading. Presumably, because they don't have the rights, The Beijing Olympics have been erased as completely as Trotsky's name in later editions of John Reed's Ten Days that Shook the World. Strewth.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>04:35am: </strong>Later in the morning, we'll get our first glimpse of several more Brit hopefuls. Rightly-acclaimed poster boy, <a href=\"http://www.benainslie.com/default.asp\">Ben Ainslie</a>, goes for his third consecutive gold medal in the Heavy Weight Dinghy competition. Also worth following will be Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson, who are the criminally unheralded favourites in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/05/olympicssailing.olympicgames2008\">Keelboat </a>(Yngling) class.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>04:55am: </strong>Back to the weightlifting, where we're at the clean &amp; jerk stage. The weights have been disappointing so far - the event kicked off atypically early, around 10.30am Chinese time, and to be blunt you can't just role out of bed and lift one hundred and ten kilos. In the absence of the elephantine weights I was expecting, I've allowed myself to be distracted by the unexpected weightlifting beauty of <a href=\"http://www.nbcolympics.com/athletes/athlete=66114/bio/index.html\">Melanie Noel</a>. However, now Madamoiselle Noel is out, then the quality of competition is more than making up for the lack of World Record breaking activity. Chinese star Chen Xiexia looks in control but the other medal placings are between Korean Im Jyoung-Hwa, the impressive Taiwanese lifter Chen Wei Ling, the Thai Pensiri Laosirikul and rising Turkish talent Sibel \u00d6zkan.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>04:59am: </strong>More from the beach volleyball. Bad news for Swiss fans, the women's team lost 0-2 to China, while the men's team were beaten by the same score by the Netherlands. Hey, maybe Roger Federer will make it all right by routing Russia's Dmitry Tursunov later in the tennis.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>05:09am: Gold medal - women's 48 kg weightlifting: Chen Xiexia (CHN) </strong></p> <p>Chen Xiexia has taken the first Chinese gold of the Games, she made it look easy, and was a country mile ahead of the rest of the field. Second was Sibel \u00d6zkan from Turkey and third was Chen Wei Ling from Taiwan. Next China will get to add to what is certain to be a Midas-ly monstrous haul of golds in the Men's 10m air pistol final.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>05:30am: </strong>We've a grappling chance of a medal in the judo, where Black Country judoka Craig Fallon will be competing in the men's 60kg competition, which is just bouting off now. On paper Fallon looks a shoo in. Except that while he was crowned world champion in 2005, and then European champion in 2006, he crashed out in the second round in Athens. After his defeat at the hands of Revazi Zintiridis, his coach blamed the ref, \"you're not going to get any favours from the referees\" when you're \"in Greece fighting a Greek guy\". We'll see.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>05:41am:</strong> To the gymnasium, where the men's teams are locked in qualifying (team and individual) battle. Italian Enrico Pozzo is currently letting loose on the pole horse, people in the know say it was average, but to my eyes it was extraordinary. The Chinese athletes, of course, have always excelled in this area. Anyone else remember <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5YALP1BdEg\">this?</a></p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>05:50am: </strong>In the second women's basketball match New Zealand are following the winning example of neighbours, everybody needs good neighbours Australia, they're leading Mali 42-33 at half-time.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>06:05am: </strong>One of the nicest stories from out of the leftfield of the Athens Olympics was the silver medal of photogenic badminton mixed doubles pair Gail Emms and Nathan Robertson. Well, the singles tournament is already underway. Pick of the games so far was Indonesian Maria Kristen Yulianti staging a late fightback to beat German hopeful Juliane Schenk in a superb three setter. The Chinese top seeds Lin Dan (male) and Xie Xingfang (female) play tomorrow. Athens quarter finalist Tracey Hallem and rising male hopeful and world no.20 Andrew Smith provide the home challenge. In Guardian land, I need to beat Phil Passey to stay in the Premier League on Tuesday.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>06:14am: </strong>If you're wondering quite why we haven't had that glimpse of Ben Ainslie going for his third gold in the sailing yet, or why I haven't given you more on Yngling favourites Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson, it's because the sailing events have been delayed. Meantime Team GB rower, <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/09/counting_down_the_hours_till_r.html \">Richard Chambers</a> shares his experience of preparing for a big Olympic day on the water.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>06:18am:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/09/olympics2008.olympicsshooting1\">Lawrence Donegan</a> reflects on how Katerina Emmons upset the formbook and overcame a headache, and the will of a billion odd Chinese people, to beat local hero Du Li, to the first gold of the Games.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>06:20am: </strong>More on the lack of the scheduled sailing competition, it's apparently nothing more sinister than a lack of wind. It's just a postponement at Qingdao \"one of the most windless places on the planet\" and maybe not the first we'll see.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>06:30am:</strong> It's not that much of an exaggeration to say that Craig Fallon had no sooner begun his fight with Monaco's unfancied Hann Siccardi, than he beat him. Our Black Country boy is comfortably through to the second round. Good job.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>06:35am: </strong>More results and news for your delectation. In the women's beach volleyball the Australians beat the Russians 2-1, while New Zealand eventually closed out Mali in the women's basketball 76-72. Meanwhile, Qingdao is getting gusty and the sailing is starting up.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>06:47am: </strong>Back to the pommel horse. Huntingdon-based hopefuls Louis Smith and Daniel Keatings have finished their routines - both hope to make the individual final but the exciting 19 year-old Smith made several minor errors while teammate Keatings' spoiled a fine effort by losing his balance as he dismounted. Despite all the huff and puff about it being a learning experience for London in four years time, they'll be disappointed if they fail to make the final. Fingers crossed. Better news comes from the cycling, where 19 year-old Brit Johnny Bellis is handily placed as they approach the Great Wall of China.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>07:04am: </strong>Lack of wind or no, Ben Ainslie has made a storming start in the dingy and has cut his way through the fleet with only Croatia's Ivan Kljakovi\u0107 Ga\u0161pi\u0107 keeping in touch. Less good news in the Yngling, where the British team were trailing in last, and despite picking up, have it all to do in the downwind half of the first race.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>07:17am: </strong>James DeGale, the only Team GB boxer in action today, is going into the fourth round against Egypt's Mohamed Hikal in the opening round of the middleweight division. Sad to say, the Hammersmith boy is in bother. Frankie Gavin debacle aside, you gotta trust <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/08/olympicsboxing.olympics2008?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=sport\">John Rawling</a>, that things will turn around for the British boxing team.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>07:20am: </strong>Bored by the news that Katerina Emmons won the first Gold in Beijing? <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/09/after_32_minutes_beijing_2008s.html\">Andy Bull </a>follows the first loser, Australian badminton hopeful Erin Carroll, gone in 30 odd minutes.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>07:24am: </strong>He lost the first round or so, but boxer James DeGale triumphed 13-4 over Mohamed Hikal of Egypt in the end. Welcome good news.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>07:38am: </strong>The wind has dropped again in the sailing, and with it Ben Ainslie's command of the field in this first race. Charismatic Greek, Emilios Papathanassiou, has overhauled both Ben Ainslie and Ivan Kljakovi\u0107 Ga\u0161pi\u0107 to lead by a distance. In fact, a fair few have sailed past our man Ainslie including America, Brazil and Poland. He finished tenth, a dramatic collapse after the wind died.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>07:46am: </strong>It's second round misery again for Craig Fallon, he's lost his second round match against European champion Ludwig Paischer from Austria. And doubling the unhappy Athens deja vu, Fallon didn't have the rub of the green from the referee either. Bronze is now the best he can do.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>07:56am: </strong>The cycling is cracking on - with Stefan Schumacher, a two-stage winner in this year's Tour de France, currently setting the pace. Sadly, there's not going to be a fairy tale for the teenage Brit Johnny Bellis, who's fallen away. From young hopeful to grizzled veteran, <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/09/longo_joins_elite_group_of_sev.html \">William Fotheringham </a>pays tribute to seven-time Olympian Jeannie Longo who rides in the women's race tomorrow.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>08:08am: </strong>It's 8am, which means that it's time for Lutz, Tom Lutz. But before I handover, let me bring you up to date with some of the non-Brit action. In the women's handball Hungary beat Sweden 30-24. In the women's beach volleyball their have been wins for China and Italy. And lastly, but not leastly, China are up in their basketball game with Spain. Should be a close game, that. And now talking you through the last five medals of the first day it's Mr Lutz.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>8.15am: </strong>Oh, hello. A few zingers coming up later today. We've got a shooting medal to be decided in the next few minutes in the 10m air pistol final and the there'll be more slashing than in a horror movie double bill later as the women's sabre medals are decided.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>8.18am: </strong> Big news at the beach volleyball courts where George Bush has stopped by to ogl\u2026 support the US women's team as they practise ahead of their campaign.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>8.24am </strong> China's Pang Wei is destroying the competition in the men's 10m air pistol. He's going to have to shoot one of the judges, or George Bush on the beach volleyball court if he's going to stuff it up at this point. He looks disappointed as his first shot goes just wide of the centre, but it's good enough to secure the gold. <strong>Two golds for China then</strong>, only 563 more to go.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>8.28 am: </strong> Medals from 10m air pistol final: <br>Gold: Pang Wei (China)<br>Silver: Jin Jong-oh (South Korea)<br>Bronze Kim Jong-su (North Korea)</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>8.38am :</strong>You'll want to know about the men's road race, won't you? Kuschyinski from Belarus/NOT BRITAIN and Pidgornyy from Ukraine/NOT BRITAIN are about 90 seconds ahead of the peloton. There's still an hour and a half to go though, so plenty of time for them to be caught.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>8.40am - Sportsman you might have heard of watch: </strong>Tour de France winner Carlos Sastre is back in the peloton minding his own business, ready to make his move.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>8.47am: </strong>Britain's Alan Campbell wins his single sculls heat and is through to the quarters.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>8.54am: </strong>Sean Ingle has been wandering around Beijing inhaling huge lungfuls of not-as-polluted-as-it-once-was air and come to the conclusion that <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/09/humidity_is_the_athletes_enemy.html\">it's the humidity that will harm athletes</a>, not the pollution. The women's archery team is through to the final and, like Henry Kelly in his heyday, will be going for gold tomorrow.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>9.02am: </strong>Our man Fallon battles it out for the chance of a bronze. His opponent is Morocco's Ahamdi. Fallon, by the way, sports a jaunty bandage round a cut over his left eye, which gives him a rather piratical air. All the judo kids will be wearing it come September, trust me. Gah! That cut has turned into a spurting geyser now and the doctor's on. Fallon is up 11-0 though.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>9.03am: </strong>And Fallon is through. He ground out the last seconds of the fight and his bronze dreams are still alive.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>9.12am: </strong> The NOT BRITISH breakaway pack are being hauled in by the peloton in the men's road race, their lead is now just over 40 seconds. The Olympic champion Paolo Bettini from NOT BRITAIN has dropped back after a puncture.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>9.17am: </strong>\"Who leads the cycling road race,\" asks Gary Naylor. \"I've always found it amusing watching how the trade team alliances (and potential contracts for next year) count for rather more than the Olympic ideal. But that's the deal with cycling - a rare sport that started not as an amateur pastime, but as a professional sport.\" It's Ukraine and Belarus out front, which is a kind of alliance, in that they're a quite close to each other \u2013 and better mates than say, ooh, Georgia and Russia.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>9.19am: </strong> Ben Ainslie, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/mar/15/smalltalk.sportinterviews\">who I once put some pretty tough questions about killer whales to</a>, has won his second race in the sailing.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>9.28am: </strong>Bettini is making a comeback in the cycling and is towards the front of the peloton. The Spaniards are packed together and looking ominous.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>9.31am: </strong>Craig Fallon is up against Kim in the judo. Two more victories and he's got the bronze. And the BBC feed disappears as they clash fort he first time. Fantastic.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>9.37am: </strong>Ah, good work. We're back on the judo and Fallon's stopped bleeding too. He's 100-0 up for a half-ippon, which is kind of like half knocking someone out.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>9.43am: </strong>Kim should just punch Fallon repeatedly in the eyebrows \u2013 Fallon's fatal flaw, along with Austrian judokas is his easily cut brows - if he wants to win, but he's an honourable opponent and Fallon scraps out the win. Two more victories and he'll have the bronze.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>9.46am: </strong>The NOT BRITISH leading pair have been enveloped by the NOT BRITISH chasing pack. The Spaniards are still sticking together and a NOT BRITISH Austrian cyclist has decided to go on a solo break.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>9.52am: </strong>Yep, the Austrian - Pffenberger - is starting to tire and the chasing pack closes in.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>9.56am: </strong>Bettini has fallen back into the pack with 21km to go. Cadel \"Fun\" Evans is frowning his way into a promising position, but the Spaniards are working together and that could be crucial.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>10.03am: </strong>\"Back in the days of Grandstand and Sportsnight, the BBC would occasionally further our education by covering minority sports and most welcome it was (except dressage),\" says Gary Naylor. \"Now, the BBC barely bothers with sport at all outside Wimbledon, The Open and set pieces like The Olympics and The World Cup. Sky and Eurosport do a decent job but people only buy Sky for the football and possibly the cricket. So - my question - is there anyone with terrestrial TV only who recognises any of the competitors or has seen any of these sports since the last Olympics?\" You obviously missed the Cash In The Attic Modern Pentathlon Special where they discovered the stuffed body of the horse used to win the 1912 Olympics, hidden in an attic in Ashby-de-la-Zouch.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>10.05am: </strong>In the cycling, Schleck attempts to get away from the pack, but he's reeled back in.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>10.12am: </strong>Our cheap gimmick of the Games, involves you, the reader, pitting your wits against a betting rat.

While the men's four have just got away in the heats. After 1.3 metres they're in a miserable fourth place. Pathetic.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>10.37am: </strong>Brilliant recovery, they're up into first after 1km.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>10.38m: </strong> Britain \u2013 sporting that trusty rowing combination of floppy hair, double-barreled names and good jaws \u2013 still lead after 1,500m ahead of the Italians.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>10.40am: </strong>Britain ease home in the men's four in first place.

Under 58 seconds and they're in with a chance of progressing. Halsall is third at the turn, with Lowe in fourth. They end up fourth (Lowe) and fifth (Halsall), that's good enough for Lowe to make the semis, Halsall will miss out.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>12.16pm: Results for the women's 48kg judo</strong><br>Gold: Alina Alexandra Dumitru (Romania) <br>Silver: Yanet Bermoy (Cuba)<br>Bronze: Ryoko Tani (Japan)</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>12.27pm: </strong>By the way, if you want to read about Britain's archers' success this morning, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/09/olympicsarchery.olympics2008\">click here</a>, for more on Craig Fallon's woe <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/09/olympicsjudo.olympics20081\">click here</a> and for William Fotheringham's analysis of the cycling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/09/olympicscycling.olympics2008\">click here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>12.29pm: </strong>In the gymnastics, Britain's Louis Smith is fourth after two thirds of the pommel horse qualification, and Daniel Keatings is eighth. However, Keating's almost certain to drop out as the Romanians and Koreans have their crack at qualifying this evening. Better news for Keatings is that he's sixth in the all-round event, so could cling on for a place in the final there. If either Smith or Keatings reach the final, some grizzly old hack who looks like he knows a thing or two reckons it'll be the first time a British male has ever done so in Olympic gymnastics.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>12.33pm: </strong> Dean Milwain finishes down in seventh in the men's 400m freestyle. Some people say Britain's swimmers start fast enough, but I think we're doing a fine job of going out very quickly indeed.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>12.35pm: Results for the men's 60kg judo</strong><br>Gold: Choi Minho (South Korea)<br>Silver: Ludwig Paischer (Austria) <br>Bronze: Rishod Sobirov (Uzbekistan) <br>Ruben Houkes (Netherlands)</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>12.42pm: </strong>David Carry is up against the might of Grant Hackett in the final heat of the 400m freestyle. Hackett's had a shoulder injury, and starts off well, but is reeled in by Vanderkaay of the US, before a late burst sees him edge out the American into second. Carry puts in a British record as he finishes fifth - it's not good enough for a place in the final, sadly.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>12.54pm: </strong>Keri-Anne Payne and Hannah Miley are competing for Britain in the women's 400m medley.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>1.06pm: </strong> Keri-Anne Payne goes in lane six in the third heat. She finishes in fifth and that's probably the end of her campaign in this event.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>1.13pm: </strong>Kirsty Coventry, one of the favourties for the 400m medley, finishes in third in her heat behind Steph Rice of Australia and is sixth fastest at the moment. She may not make the final if the last heat is a fast one.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>1.17pm: </strong>Word-record holder Katie Hoff goes in the final heat against Hannah Miley, the other races have been pretty fast, so Miley will need to get in Hoff's slipstream if she's to have a chance.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>1.18pm: </strong>Miley is in second place at 150m...</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>1.19pm: </strong>... and at 200m.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>1.21pm: </strong>Hoff takes control at 300m and is a second in the lead ahead of Miley.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>1.22pm: </strong> Miley finishes in Hoff's wake, but it's good enough for her to record the eighth fastest time overall. We'll see her in tomorrow's final.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>1.25pm: Results for the women's sabre</strong><br>Gold: Mariel Zagunis (USA)<br>Silver: Sada Jacobson (USA)<br>Bronze: Becca Ward (USA)</p> <p>Conclusion: don't get into a sword fight in America.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>1.46pm: </strong>There's been some pretty pacy heats in the men's 100m breaststroke, so Britain's Chris Cook is going to have his work cut out. And he duly finishes in fourth, should be good enough to get into the semis.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>1.49pm: </strong>Kris Gilchrist is next up for Britain in the 100m breaststroke. Gilhrist's more of a 200m specialist, he finishes in seventh and won't make the semis. Cook, however, will. That was a ridiculously quick set of heats and Cook did very well to qualify 15th fastest.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>1.52pm: </strong>Last race of our kind-of-five-minute-delay coverage. Britain go in the women's 4x100m freestyle. Britain finish the first leg in first place.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>1.53pm: </strong>Britain are second after 250m...</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>1.55pm: </strong>... but they fade as the Chinese surge into first. Britain end in fourth place - they record a British record too - and will have to wait for the second semi-final to see if they come back again tomorrow.</p>",
  "<p>When I came to the US, I thought I was in journalist's heaven. Any serious revelations in the British press would be followed by lawyers' letters threatening writs and sometimes, for well-heeled litigants, actual libel writs to match. As several jurisdiction-miners have discovered, even telling the truth can on occasion be no defence in British courts. Hell, as recently as 1977 they even reinvented a centuries-old offence of \"blasphemous libel,\" to <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/11/newsid_2499000/2499721.stm\">convict a poet</a> for writing about sex with a long-deceased Jesus Christ. But in the US, it was virtually impossible to libel even a live public figure!</p> <p>But then I discovered that this was much less significant than I thought, since the US media is normally so deferential of politicians that one almost admires the <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=5441195&amp;page=1\">National Enquirer</a> \u2013 not least because it <a href=\"http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/usage/enquire\">knows the difference</a> between \"inquire\" and \"enquire\".</p> <p>One can see why so many of the supermarket tabloid reporters were refugees from British media law, where a judge can rule a story about the former British fascist leader's son having S&amp;M with prostitutes as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jul/24/mosley.privacy\">an invasion of privacy</a>. He did not deny the story as such \u2013 but simply said it was none of the press's business. Nor was it.</p> <p>When British Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown and former Foreign Secretary Robin Cook were outed for having affairs with their secretaries, they fessed up and their popularity rose. But note the difference.</p> <p>Unlike their British counterparts, the National Enquirer did not make stories up. When <a href=\"http://www.americanheritage.com/people/articles/web/20070508-gary-hart-donna-rice-george-mcgovern-democratic-presidential-primary-political-scandal.shtml\">Gary Hart</a> told them to bring it on: they did. When Bill Clinton denied Gennifer Flowers, they got him. And now <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080808/ap_on_el_pr/edwards_affair\">John Edwards is admitting</a> they got him as well. And they all dissimulated. Extra-marital sex may be one of the fringe benefits of political life, but getting caught in the lie outright could be fatal.</p> <p>Even so, the hypocrisy of Democratic party leaders now working out how to keep Edwards off the podium at their convention does show double standards. They would certainly welcome former President Bill Clinton up there, whom the Enquirer also got bang to rights, as it were. Even more tellingly, when did Newt Gingrich ever lack for a platform in the party of family values and the religious right despite his trying to bully his wife into more favourable divorce terms in her cancer recovery ward?</p> <p>John McCain himself divorced the wife who had stayed married to him during the years he spent in a Vietnamese prison, and married into the money that now helps bankroll his political ambitions. Rudy Giuliani, while mayor of New York, announced his divorce at a press conference without telling his wife beforehand. Neither of these men seems to have suffered politically within the party of the teenage abstinence, familial integrity and marital fidelity.</p> <p>A senior UN official once asked another official why I had not carried a story about his affair with his secretary, since I knew about it. The accurate reply was I saw no public - that is, civic - interest. He was not committing any crime and had not made a public career of parading family values and feigned Pauline Christian morality. It was irresistible to gossip about in the bar of the Delegates' Lounge, but entirely resistible to write about it. \"Let him who is without sin cast the first stone\", is the relevant text.</p> <p>American law does not protect privacy, unlike European law, but it certainly has a point in excluding public figures from libel protection. On a pragmatic point, people who run for public office should be savvy enough to do the Caesar's wife thing. How can you expect someone who is indiscreet enough to get caught to run a superpower, with its necessary lies and secrets?</p> <p>In addition, hypocrisy should always be the subject of journalists' attention. Lying and then getting caught out will always prolong the media attention. Take a tip from Rudy and Newt, be brazen in your hypocrisy, and even the religious right will forget about it in a very short time.</p>"
