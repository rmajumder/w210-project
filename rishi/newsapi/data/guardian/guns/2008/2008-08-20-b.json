  "<p>First of all you need to decide whether you want to study full-time or combine your studies with work.</p> <p>Broadly speaking, there are three routes open to you depending on how you like to learn. Within the range of qualifications there will be something to suit most people.</p> <p>If you like academic, paper-based learning, then A-levels, an International Baccalaureate (or a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2006/oct/24/schools.1419education\">Welsh bacc</a> if you're in Wales) or the Cambridge Pre-U might be for you.</p> <p>If you prefer a mix of hands-on learning and theory then the new diploma, or the tried and tested BTec (Business and Technology Education Council) might prove better options, and can always be combined with A-levels. </p> <p>However, it's worth noting that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/apr/01/schools.uk4\">ministers warned in April</a> thousands of City &amp; Guilds, BTecs and national vocational qualifications (NVQs) could be scrapped or absorbed into the new diplomas.</p> <p>If you want to train for a specific job, an apprenticeship or an NVQ might be your best bet - and they still leave open the option of university if you decide later that you want to take a degree.</p> <p>As far as entry requirements go, for A-levels it's fairly straightforward \u2013 you will need at least four GCSEs at grade A to C - but with these and most other qualifications you need to check with your school or college what they expect. </p> <p>If you're interested in a particular course or subject, you could also go to the exam boards (listed below) and check the entry requirements with them.</p> <h2>A-levels</h2> <p>These are still the best option if you like paper-based learning and you've got the required grades to take them.</p> <p>From September, the structure of A-levels will be changing. Instead of six modules, you'll study only four in more depth. Exams are taken at the end of each module, which count towards your final mark and can be retaken.</p> <p>There'll be more extended essays for you to write and you'll be expected to make connections between different aspects of the subjects.</p> <p>In the exams there will be more open-ended questions and you'll be able to earn a new A* if you're one of the top performers.</p> <p>The first A* grades will be awarded in 2010. </p> <p>You also have the option of doing an extended project, if you want to look into a particular subject and do some independent research. The project will be worth half an A-level and might help you stand out from the crowd if you decide to apply to university.</p> <p>There are also applied A-levels, which are A-levels taken in more vocational subjects, such as leisure and tourism. But these are being slowly phased out and will be available only until diplomas are offered in all subjects across the country (expected to be 2011).</p> <p>If you live in Scotland, you'll be able to take Scottish Highers and Advanced Highers, which are the equivalent of A-levels.</p> <h2>AS-levels</h2> <p>If you pass your first year of A-level and decide not to continue with your studies you will be awarded an AS-level.</p> <p>AS-levels are a good opportunity to try out a subject and get a qualification even if you decide not to carry on to A-level. And there are more than 70 AS-levels to choose from.</p> <h2>Cambridge Pre-U Diploma</h2> <p>Some schools are offering this new qualification from the University of Cambridge, which is supposed to be tougher than A-levels and make it easier for universities to distinguish between the best candidates.</p> <p>It's mostly private schools that are giving students the chance to take this qualification instead of A-levels but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/jul/23/alevels.cambridgeuniversity\">15 state schools have signed up</a> so far, so you will need to check whether it's something your school is offering.</p> <p>For the CPU, you take at least three \"principal\" subjects from a choice of 26.</p> <p>Instead of taking exams at the end of each module, you'll take exams at the end of the two-year course. You'll be expected to write more essays and there will be no retakes.</p> <p>Alongside your chosen subjects, you'll have to complete an independent research report and a \"global perspectives portfolio\". Through a series of seminars based on themes - practical ethics, economics, environment, technology, and politics and culture \u2013 you'll build up a portfolio of work including audio-visual and web-based presentations and develop detailed research proposals.</p> <p>The portfolio and research report can be taken as stand-alone qualifications, alongside A-levels, which could make your application stand out when applying for university. The CPU has been approved by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, although Ucas has yet to reveal what it is worth, compared with A-levels.</p> <h2>International Baccalaureate</h2> <p>This worldwide qualification is offered mostly by private schools. You will take six subjects - three at a standard level and three at a higher level over two years. You'll have some choice over subjects but the idea is to give a rounded education so you have to continue with English, a second language, a science, maths, arts and humanities.</p> <p>Full marks in the IB are equivalent to more than seven A-grade A-levels.</p> <h2>Welsh baccalaureate</h2> <p>This is a diploma on three levels for 14 to 19-year-olds. But at the post-16 advanced level, you'd take two or more A-levels plus an advanced core module.</p> <p>The core at level 3 is worth 120 Ucas points, equivalent to an A-level grade A.</p> <h2>Diplomas</h2> <p>The first five of these <a href=\"http://yp.direct.gov.uk/diplomas\">new qualifications </a> will be taught from September, although eventually, by 2011, there will be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/oct/23/schools.1419education\"> 17 of them</a> to choose from.</p> <p>The first five are in:<br><a href=\"http://www.engineeringdiploma.com\">engineering</a>,<br><a href=\"http://www.cbediploma.co.uk\">construction</a>,<br><a href=\"http://www.e-skills.com/diploma\">information technology</a>,<br><a href=\"http://www.creativediploma.com\">creative and media</a>,<br><a href=\"http://diploma.skillsforhealth.org.uk\">society, health and development</a></p> <p>Diplomas are a mixture of classroom learning and practical experience that should qualify you to go into a mixture of skilled jobs or on to university if you choose.</p> <p>There are three different levels of diploma: foundation (level 1), higher (level 2) and advanced (level 3).</p> <p>Assuming you've got your GCSEs, you'll be heading for an advanced diploma. In which case, you'll do an extended project \u2013 which will mean doing research into an area of your subject that you're particularly interested in and writing about it \u2013 as well as taking an A-level or equivalent qualifications. </p> <p>The government has put together a <a href=\"http://www.accreditedqualifications.org.uk/DiplomaCatalogueSelection.aspx\">catalogue</a> of possible qualifications you could take to make up your diploma.</p> <p>All the diplomas will be made up of three parts: principal learning; generic learning and additional specialist learning.</p> <p>Principal learning \u2013 you'll study qualifications developed for the diploma in your chosen subject, eg engineering, and undertake a project in this area.</p> <p>Generic learning \u2013 this is where you'll learn \"functional skills\" such as English, maths and ICT and develop skills to help make you more employable, such as presentation, communication and teamworking. You'll also have to do 10 days work experience, ideally in a field related to your diploma subject, so if you're taking the engineering diploma, this could mean seeing how an architect works.</p> <p>Additional specialist learning \u2013 this is where you specialise in some aspect of your subject and learn more of the academic theory behind it. You will have to complete an extended project and take an A-level or equivalent in a related subject. For example, you could take an A-level in art if you're taking the creative diploma, or two AS-levels or a BTec.</p> <p>How demanding each element of the diploma will be will depend on which level you're taking. </p> <h2>BTec</h2> <p>These are vocational qualifications that prepare you to go into work or higher education.</p> <p>There are three types of qualification all at Level 3 (equivalent to A-level): the BTec National Award; BTec National Certificate and BTec National Diploma.</p> <p>The 6-unit National Award is a specialist qualification that focuses on particular aspects of your chosen subject. It is broadly equivalent to one A-level and is graded pass, merit or distinction.</p> <p>The 12-unit National Certificate is more specialised and you can choose what area of your chosen subject to focus on. It is broadly equivalent to two A-levels.</p> <p>The 18-unit BTec National Diploma extends and deepens your understanding of your chosen area of study and prepares you for work in this field. It is broadly equivalent to three A-levels.</p> <h2>Apprenticeships</h2> <p>If you're not keen on a traditional, academic approach to learning and prefer a more hands-on approach, an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/jan/28/1419education.furthereducation\">apprenticeship</a> might be a good option.</p> <p>It's also a good idea if you know what career you want to go into, but would still like to keep the option of university open as you can go on to take a foundation degree fairly easily after completing an apprenticeship.</p> <p>You will be based with a company, learning the job on the ground, but will have days off to study at college. The work/study split will be decided between you and your employer.</p> <p>Alternatively, you could do a programme-led apprenticeship (PLA), where you spend a year or so in college learning theory and key skills before you go to an employer for on-the-job training to get a an NVQ qualification.</p> <p>To <a href=\"http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/wanttobecomeanapprentice/aboutapprenticeships/howtoapply/\">apply</a> for an apprenticeship you can approach an employer directly about the possibility of taking you on or call the national Apprenticeships hotline on 08000 150 600, which will then be able to put you in touch with local employers and training centres.</p> <p>For more information on your options, you could visit the Connexions Direct website: http://www.connexions-direct.com/itsyourchoice/choiceisyours/</p> <h2>City &amp; Guilds</h2> <p><a href=\" http://www.city-and-guilds.co.uk\">City &amp; Guilds</a> also offer vocational qualifications. There are more than 400 subjects to choose from.</p> <h2>NVQs</h2> <p>For those who are not keen on continuing studying after 16, and decide to get a job, you can still gain qualifications for the work you do through an <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/QualificationsExplained/DG_10039029\">NVQ</a>. NVQs assess the skills that candidates demonstrate at work and are available at five levels, from level 1 - for routine jobs - to level 5 - for jobs with complex tasks and substantial responsibility: </p> <p>For more information on your options from 14-19, click <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/14To19/OptionsAt16/DG_10013574\">here</a>.</p> <h2>Exam boards</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.edexcel.org.uk\">Edexcel</a><br>020 7190 5700</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.aqa.org.uk\">Assessment and Qualifications Alliance (AQA)</a><br>01483 506506</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ocr.org.uk\">Oxford, Cambridge and RSA (OCR)</a><br>01223 553 998</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.wjec.co.uk\">Welsh Joint Education Committee (WJEC)</a><br>029 2026 5000</p>",
  "<p>Now in version 2, Adobe's Lightroom is a tool both for the professional and for the well-heeled and/or serious enthusiast (\u00a3189.98 on <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk\">Amazon.co.uk</a>, upgrade \u00a379.98). If you've got Photoshop, it integrates well with that application, allowing you to flip between the pixel-level editing of Photoshop and the (I think) more useful workflow management tools of Lightroom. If you haven't got Photoshop, you've got enough editing tools in Lightroom not to need another program.</p> <p>Rather than faff about with single images in Photoshop or another application, you can deal with multiple images. Lightroom imports your images and then offers you five views. Library gives you quick access to all your files across multiple hard drives. This is where you organise images by metadata such as the shooting date, the lens and camera you used and keywords; and also where you search for images.</p> <p>The Develop view is where you apply presets, tweak images, adjust histograms, fix red-eye, fiddle with the tone curve and so on. What is particularly nice about Lightroom is that all your edits are non-destructive: your changes are stored as metadata with the original file. Slideshow is - yes, you guessed it - where you create slideshows. There are some presets and you can download more user-created ones via the <a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/adobe2\">Lightroom Exchange website</a>. Slideshows can be exported as JPegs or as PDFs, though more fun are the web pages you can produce quickly in the Web view.</p> <p>These use Flash to create pages that you can upload to your website, or, using plug-ins created by the user community, export to Gallery-driven websites or more mainstream sharing sites such as Picasa and Flickr.</p> <p>Finally, the Print view sets up printing for you, with lots of options such as mix-and-match sizes on one sheet, photo borders, print resolution and sharpening. Again, you can use the presets or create your own. </p> <p>As with all Adobe software, there's a lot to get to grips with and that is one of the downsides: unless you're a seasoned professional, you're unlikely to do much more than scratch the surface of its possibilities. It's also quite hard on the computer: my Vista PC reported that it was using 1.47GB of my 2GB of RAM at one point. It says the minimum specs are 1GB of RAM (both Mac and PC). On the upside, Version 2 now works with 64bit operating systems (both Mac and PC) and it supports multiple monitor setups. </p> <p>I like it, and have done for a long time. It's reasonably intuitive, so long as you're familiar with both digital and film photography jargon, and you can be up and running in it pretty quickly from a standing start. Pricewise, well, it's not the cheapest package you'll find but it's one of the most versatile. </p> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> One-stop shop for printing, processing and sharing images</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Uses a lot of RAM; potentially confusing for the novice </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/lightroom\">adobe.com/lightroom</a></p>",
  "<p>Driving past fields of sunflowers in the August sunshine, you see what at first appears to be a campsite with lots of cars and people milling around. They might be on holiday, enjoying a few days' peace in this quiet pine forest in northern Spain. Look a little closer, though, and this clearing throws up something distinctly darker. A small group is peering into a hole the size of a bomb crater, about a metre deep. At the bottom are young archaeologists, dusting off the bones of five mangled skeletons. One skull looks up to the sky, its open-mouthed expression like a cry for help. Between what were the eyes, there is a hole. This is where a 9mm bullet entered.</p> <p>In this wretched hole in the ground, near the tiny village of San Juan del Monte, in Castilla y Le\u00f3n, are the remains of five more of Spain's \"disappeared\". Julio Maroto San Jos\u00e9, his father Roman Maroto Rico, Rogelito Tello, and the brothers Marcos Parra Barberra and Salvador Parra Barberra were shot by supporters of General Francisco Franco on August 25 1936. The four youngest were all in their 20s; most had children. One night they were hauled off by civil guard officers in a lorry, made to dig their own graves and shot in the head. They were not condemned by a court. Their \"crime\" was to belong to the Spanish equivalent of the General Workers Union. Now, 72 years later, a small band of volunteers has arrived in San Juan del Monte to exhume the bodies of these five and give them a decent burial.</p> <p>Historians believe there could be as many as 100,000 others like them, buried across the country. During the Spanish civil war, between 1936-1939, and afterwards while General Franco ruled Spain, his supporters, as well as the Republicans on the other side, carried out summary executions, dumping the innocent victims in hundreds of mass graves. Many of these have remained untraced until now. </p> <p>Campaigners whose fathers, grandfathers or uncles disappeared into the night a lifetime ago have painstakingly traced them, by checking old prison records, yellowing council documents and speaking to those whose fading memories recall something of what happened to these people and where they might be buried. Often local people knew where the graves were but, until now, were too afraid to say. Spain preferred to pretend the killings never happened, but the volunteers are determined that the dead will not lie unremembered in ditches or pine forests. Almost every weekend, ageing relatives and members of groups such as the Association for the Recuperation of the Historical Memory (ARHM) carry out exhumations like the one at San Juan del Monte. </p> <p>The Spanish state had offered little help before, but now Spain's campaigning judge Baltasar Garz\u00f3n has become involved. He is the first investigating magistrate to trace his own country's disappeared. In the past, Garz\u00f3n has investigated the crimes of dictators and their henchmen in foreign countries, notably Argentina and Chile. He is best known in Britain for his unsuccessful attempt in 1998 to extradite the late Chilean dictator General Pinochet while he was in London for medical treatment. After legal pressure from campaigners, Garz\u00f3n has demanded that the official archives be opened to reveal just how many Spaniards were shot by firing squad - and where they might be buried. </p> <p>What he is trying to establish is if there is any proof, as campaigners claim, that these murders were carried out on a systematic basis under orders from above. If a case can be made, the judge could decide to call for a Spanish version of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, though this seems unlikely. The response to Garz\u00f3n's demand for information from the defence and interior ministries was disappointing, both directing the judge to the archives of the civil guard held near Madrid. The archive is officially open to researchers, but campaigners suspect that much within it has been kept secret. Whatever the outcome, it will be a long and torturous process before the Spanish state opens up and reveals what it knows about those who went missing. </p> <p>But these matters are far from the thoughts of the relatives whose loved ones died in the ignominious pit at San Juan del Monte so long ago. Rafino Tello Alonso, 75, watches as the bones of what could be his father Rogelio are carried piece by piece from the grave by archaeologists and catalogued in bags. Rogelio and the other victims all worked extracting resin from the pine trees that grow all over this part of Castilla y L\u00e9on. </p> <p>\"I was three when they took my father away so I don't remember much about him at all. But all my life my mother and my family said I was like him. It has been very hard. I have felt angry all my life because I never had a father,\" he says, tears welling up. \"We were from Arauza de Miel [Arauza of Honey] nearby. It is a sweet name but this is a bitter story.\"</p> <p>Julia Maroto Velasco, 71, peers into the grave trying to guess which one of the skeletons might have belonged to her father Julio or her grandfather Roman. Her mother, Ana Velasco, 93, was two months' pregnant with her when the men were called by civil guard officers who arrived on a lorry in Arauza de Miel. Roman protested when his son Julio was dragged off, so the civil guard took him too. They disappeared into the night and never came back. </p> <p>\"When they said they had found my father's body, it was the best thing that happened to me,\" says Julia, a retired servant. \"Of course it makes me angry to think of these injustices. Growing up without a father or a grandfather was terrible. But I never thought I would get this happiness and sadness at the same time.\"</p> <p>Her cousin, Carlos Maroto Mate, 46, a lift mechanic from Barcelona, has brought his family to the exhumation. His sons Ruben, 19, and Raul, 13, watch quietly as the investigators go methodically about their business. At one point they find buttons, a belt buckle, then finally a 9mm bullet from a pistol.</p> <p>\"I wanted my sons to see this. It may be a little morbid, but it is real life and I want them to tell their friends about this.\" Carlos says that his father never wanted to talk about how his brother Julio and father Ramon disappeared. \"I think we should be talking about this now, not forgetting. What happens here today may only be a drop of water in the ocean, but it is important. I always said that this happened because of ignorance and fanaticism between families and neighbours.\" </p> <p>Other exhumations have been carried out in the Burgos region and across Spain in recent years. Now others like Julia are waiting to see if DNA tests will prove for once and for all where their relatives' bodies lie. When these digs take place, researchers have to rely on old records that show the names of who went missing on certain dates. They cannot be certain they are digging up the people they believe lie in the mass graves. Sometimes they never discover the identities of the bodies. </p> <p>The day after the exhumation at San Juan del Monte, scores of grey-haired relatives, mostly in their 80s or 90s, line up at the grandly named House of Culture, a council office in the nearby city of Aranda de Duero, to give their DNA samples. The building is more accustomed to putting on art shows than hosting this unusual reminder of Spain's painful past, in which people wait patiently to have swabs of saliva taken. It can take up to a year for the team of investigators to match samples to fragments of bones. The defence minister, Carme Chac\u00f3n, who hit the headlines earlier this year for being Spain's first pregnant minister, is among those waiting to discover the fate of her great-grandfather. The body of Gonzalo Liras Cerezo is believed to lie in one of the mass graves in Burgos. </p> <p>Francois Parra, 51, has come all the way from Lyon in France to have a swab taken. His grandfather, Pablo Parra Rincon, was arrested in Aranda de Duero, then disappeared in July 1936. His father, Bonifacio Parra, now 85, was forced into exile in France. He would have come to give DNA himself but was prevented by ill health.</p> <p>In poor Spanish, Francois says: \"My father said there is not a day that goes past that he doesn't think about this. That's why he was determined that I should come and do this.\"</p> <p>Others find it too difficult to talk about fathers, brothers or uncles who disappeared. One elderly woman is about to tell me about her brother when she stops mid-sentence and begins to cry quietly. It may have all happened over 70 years ago, but many of these people have not had the chance to address their pain until now.</p> <p>The day after the exhumation at San Juan del Monte, relatives gather for a quiet service at the church in Arauza de Miel to finally lay them to rest. There are tears but above all relief. Nuria Polo, 34, a film-maker from Barcelona who is making a documentary about the relatives of the disappeared, has studied their reactions.</p> <p>\"You will notice that they are not afraid to talk a lot. They are sad but also glad. For them it is closure, a kind of relief,\" she observes.</p> <p>Over the past five years, volunteers such as Emilio Silva, whose grandfather, also called Emilio, was killed and his body dumped, have tried to trace the disappeared. Silva, president of ARHM, believes Garz\u00f3n's intervention could prove a turning point.</p> <p>\"He is the first judge to ask for the official archives to be opened. We believe this could produce information which proves that these killings were systematic. If that can be shown to be the case, perhaps we could see a commission set up to find the real truth or even call those who carried out these crimes to answer.\"</p> <p>Historians struggle to agree on how many bodies may lie in mass graves, as it is an impossible question to answer with certainty. Francisco Espinosa, a historian who carried out the most comprehensive research of mass graves in Andalusia and Extremadura in the west of Spain, believes as many as 100,000 people could have gone missing, their remains lying across the country.</p> <p>\"It is difficult to say though, as no national research has been done - just on a province by province basis - and records have been destroyed,\" he cautions.</p> <p>Professor Paul Preston, a British historian from the London School of Economics, is writing a book on the slaughter of innocents called The Spanish Holocaust.</p> <p>\"There were at least 101,000 people whose names we know - perhaps more. But of those lying in mass graves, I would estimate that there are at least as many as 30,000 across Spain.\" </p> <p>He is amazed at the lack of awareness outside Spain of the crimes committed by Franco and efforts to trace his victims. \"I don't think people have the slightest idea. It is big news to them. Franco still has an amazingly good press in the Anglo-Saxon world.\"</p> <p>Since the first graves were exhumed, it has proved hard work for the small but dedicated band of volunteers who battle with bureau-cracy to trace the disappeared. They often face obstruction from conservative officials or those who would rather not go into the subject. The mass grave at San Juan del Monte was only found after help from Emilio del Cura, a local man whose father witnessed the shootings but remained silent until years later. </p> <p>A documentary about the issue, called San Cruz por Ejemplo [Santa Cruz for Example], tells the story of how this village in Burgos reacts to a team who come to exhume the bodies of a group of men killed by Franco's supporters. There is one telling scene when the Austrian film-maker, Gunter Schwaiger, asks four old men sitting on a bench if they want to talk about it. There is silence. It perhaps symbolises the Spanish attitude to dealing with these horrors. But the mood is slowly changing. In 2007, Spain's prime minister Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero brought in a law to offer justice to victims of Franco. The Law of Historical Memory - although tame compared with South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission - makes it easier to find and dig up graves, has ordered Francoist plaques and statues to be withdrawn from public buildings and opened up archives.</p> <p>The conservative opposition Popular Party and others on the right, opposed the law, claiming that it would mean raking over the ashes of the dead. After Franco died in 1975 and democracy returned following 36 years of dictatorship, a 1977 amnesty law ensured that no one could be held to account for the crimes committed during El Caudillo's regime. So it is still up to dogged volunteers such as Jos\u00e9 Ignac\u00edo Casado Ovejero, to honour the memory of those like the five who were shot at San Juan del Monte.</p> <p>The 48-year-old civil servant brandishes a thick file with copies of grim prison and council documents detailing the names of scores of men and women who were from the Burgos area. Beside many of the names, a note reads: \"Shot dead by firing squad.\"</p> <p>\"Why do I bother?\" he asks. \"Like most others, my grandfather Alejo Ovejero was shot by Franco's people. I want to find him and others like him.\"</p>",

The current record, 116.7mph, was set by an American in 1999. Jenkins, pictured right, whose hi-tech craft Greenbird has a rigid vertical wing, says he has passed 120mph in practice. If he succeeds in breaking the record he will swap the wheels on his craft for ice skates, and attempt to travel at 150mph in the frozen wilderness of North America.<br><strong>David Adam</strong></p> <h2>Reheating tomato sauce aids anti-cancer role</h2> <p>Reheating tomato sauce can enhance its anti-cancer properties, researchers at Ohio State University in Columbus say. Previous research has shown that lycopene, an antioxidant in tomatoes, can help to prevent cancers. Reheating the sauce in combination with oil changed the molecular structure so the lycopene was more easily transported into the bloodstream and body tissues, the study leader, Dr Steven Schwartz, told the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia. In a trial people had more lycopene in their blood after eating the processed sauce than after eating ordinary tomato sauce.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>'Irreplaceable' papers lost in blaze at library</h2> <p>A fire which destroyed a library and around 27,000 books was being investigated by the police and fire service yesterday.

A Devon and Cornwall police spokesman said the timber library, built in the mid-60s, was \"totally gutted\". Plymouth city council said the fire in the single-storey building destroyed \"irreplaceable\" documents relating to local history . \"Some of the history of Plympton has gone up in flames,\" said a spokesman.

The broadcaster has been considering holding a talent search to replace Vorderman, as <a href=\"htttp://MediaGuardian.co.uk\">MediaGuardian.co.uk</a> revealed last month, after the long-serving presenter's resignation. Channel 4 said the talent search was open to all, with no previous television experience necessary. However, it added that the successful applicant - to be seen on screen in January - must have \"excellent numeric and literacy skills\" and \"charm and charisma\". <br><strong>John Plunkett</strong></p> <h2>MP Ann Cryer to step down at general election</h2> <p>Labour MP Ann Cryer announced last night that she would step down from parliament at the next general election. She was elected MP for Keighley in 1997 and has campaigned on issues including forced marriage, domestic violence and honour killings. Cryer was a driving force behind a law enabling courts to intervene in cases of forced marriages which comes into effect next month. The 68-year-old told Labour party members she had decided to stand down \"mainly concerning my age, health and decreasing energy\". Cryer became an MP after the death of her politician husband Bob.<br><strong>Martin Hodgson</strong></p> <h2>Man charged with murder of stabbed 17-year-old</h2> <p>A 30-year-old man was charged last night with the murder of teenager Nilanthan Murddi, who was stabbed in Croydon, south London, early on Saturday morning. Steven Braithwaite, 30, will appear today at Sutton magistrates court. Murddi, 17, received a single stab wound to the neck and was pronounced dead at Mayday hospital, Croydon. He had been studying maths and English A-Levels at Langley Park School for Girls, which has places for boys in the sixth form, but had left school to work in his family's restaurant. He was the 23rd teenager to be killed violently in London this year.<br><strong>Martin Hodgson</strong></p>",
  "<p>We've heard some daft excuses for gigs being shut down in the past, but none quite as monumentally silly as claiming that the band's music \"gees up the crowd\". Yet this was the reason Wiltshire police gave this week for stopping Pete Doherty's band Babyshambles playing a headline show at Moonfest next weekend. In fact, the police went further, claiming to have carried out in-depth analysis on Babyshambles' music - something I have studiously avoided doing in my six years as a music journalist. </p> <p>After no doubt long and complex discussions about the harmonic structure of Fuck Forever and Killamangiro, Wiltshire police came to the conclusion that Babyshambles deliberately \"speed up and then slow down the music and create a whirlpool effect in the crowd\". This whirlpool apparently has the side-effect of getting the crowd all overexcited. But isn't geeing up the crowd the point of every live show ever in the history of music? Has someone forgotten to tell me that it's actually 1953? Besides, there are surely far rowdier crowds the police should be looking at stopping. We took a leaf out of Wiltshire constabulary's book and got to work on our own scientific analysis of the contemporary music crowd. </p> <p><strong>Indie crowds</strong></p> <p>OK, so I totally lied about all bands wanting to gee up the crowd. Twee indie acts such as Camera Obscura or Isobel Campbell go to great lengths to make their music as polite and ungeed up as possible. Acoustic guitars, fey backing vocals and recorder solos? Quick, call for back up - we're going to need the riot vans for this one! </p> <p>Weirdly, the more \"devoted\" and \"serious\" a band's fans claim to be, the less likely it is anyone will ever incite riotous behaviour. For proof, witness how unbelievably quiet and polite the fanzine-reading crowd at annual indie bash All Tomorrow's Parties are. If you see someone nodding their head gently here, it's the equivalent of seeing someone dive on stage, headbutt the bassist and puke on their own shoes at any other gig. </p> <p>Could the reason the police were so horrified at the rowdy properties of Doherty's music be because the only music they've ever heard is made by Belle and Sebastian? A quick internet check reveals that next season's Wiltshire constabulary uniform involves corduroy jeans and Bagpuss rucksacks, so the answer is probably yes. </p> <p><strong>Pop crowds</strong></p> <p>I'm sure a lot of people have considered rioting on hearing the latest Natasha Bedingfield single, but at pop gigs it's not normally the music that gets the crowd going. Oh no, it's the \"crowd participation\" between songs. Mexican waves? Being invited to join in on the choruses? Splitting the crowd in two to see which half can cheer the loudest? You don't get this at the average Bury Your Dead gig. There are also lots of parents in attendance looking rather bored. Police trying to quell riots at a pop gig would have to put up with, \"Oi, that's my little Johnny you're being mean to\" every time they tried to handcuff someone. </p> <p>However, some bands have come close to rioting, as music writer Peter Robinson explains: \"Stephen Gately [of Boyzone] used to cover up the fact that he missed high notes by grabbing his trousers at the right moment, which sent the crowd into a screaming frenzy.\" So were the riot police called? Did the venue burn to the ground? \"Erm, no. It just drowned out his singing.\" Oh, right. </p> <p><strong>Stadium crowds</strong></p> <p>The closest you normally come to a riot here is when the battery on someone's Nokia N93i camera-phone dies. Bands such as Coldplay and U2 are typical of your average stadium band, making mid-paced, epic music that is impossible to dance to without looking like someone's \"cool dad\" (ie, the rest of the crowd). Hefty ticket prices keep the younger, more enthusiastic fans at home, while seat numbers and the opportunity to spend the gig stuffing your face with badly cooked burgers isn't conducive to riotous behaviour. </p> <p>What draws such a conformist crowd in the first place? Musicologist Will Byers reckons it's not just the unchallenging, mid-tempo music but the lyrics that draw such big audiences. \"A band like Coldplay have perfected the technique of writing songs that say something without actually saying anything,\" he says. \"That way, every member of the crowd thinks the songs are about them.\" Which at least explains why you never get to see RainyDayFuckParade headlining Wembley. </p> <p><strong>Grime crowds</strong></p> <p>The 2004 Lethal Bizzle track POW! got a reputation for starting moshpit riots in a way Babyshambles' What Katy Did Next could only dream of. Grime crowds are certainly rowdy. Byers believes this is down to the heavy kick drum and \"huge, electronically altered deep sounds\": bass frequencies are created in the studio with the intent of dislodging the crowd's vital organs once they're blasted out of a club's PA system. </p> <p>But there's a difference between rowdy behaviour and actual riots. In 2005, when police shut down grime star Kano's gig at the Scala, deeming it a \"safety risk\", you had to wonder what it was about Kano's music and his largely black audience that was so dangerous. After all, when white kids get together to jump up and down it's normally the sign of a good rock or punk gig, and not a sign that somebody's life is in danger. Depressingly, one of the worst cases of crowd behaviour in recent months was when Lethal Bizzle played at the Download festival this summer, to a (mainly) white crowd, and was rewarded by being bottled and racially abused. This sends out a message to the police that most of us knew already: anyone paying good money to see the Offspring and Lostprophets should be locked up immediately. </p> <p><strong>Metal/punk crowds</strong></p> <p>It's weird that police should be so concerned about pale-faced, skinny-legged Doherty fans when metal and punk gigs normally involve people trying to smash their skulls to pulp as quickly as possible. We're talking amplifier-shredding volume and drums played 2,352 times faster than Kaiser Chiefs. </p> <p>Byers reckons it's this tempo that's key to crowd behaviour: \"Doubling the rhythm of the hi-hat, kick and snare drums has the effect of sending your heart rate soaring,\" he says. \"Your body's rhythm is almost physically connected to the tempo of the drums.\" </p> <p>This causes fans to create <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/music/2008/08/the_delicate_art_of_the_mosh_pit.html\">mosh-pits, circle pits</a> (where a circular clearing emerges in the pit, so crowd members can bash into each other) and meat grinders (the same but more painful). The band Lamb of God even originated something called the Wall of Death, which involves the crowd splitting into two halves, then charging into each other at a suitably screamy moment. It's a bit like Busted splitting the crowd for a singalong, only with broken ribs. </p> <p>So will the police be looking at shutting down punk and metal gigs? Probably not. Metal and punk crowds often have their own rules and codes of conduct when it comes to moshing, which is no doubt why police (big Slayer fans, one and all) haven't cracked down on them yet. </p> <p><strong>Noise-rock crowds</strong></p> <p>It must be pretty depressing being a noise-rock band like Lightning Bolt or Holy Fuck. I mean, you go to such great lengths giving yourself a scary name and perfecting how to squeeze every last decibel out of a venue's PA system - and then the people who pay to come and see you are all scrawny indie bloggers who couldn't fight their way out of an Isobel Campbell circle pit. </p> <p>Seriously, have you ever been to one of these shows? Everyone just stands there nodding their heads studiously. According to Wendy Fonarow, an anthropology professor at UCLA who has monitored crowd behaviour for her book Empire of Dirt, fans of noise-rock like to show that they're into their band by \"adopting a defensive position and trying to withstand as much pain as they physically can\". Or, in other words, acquiring tinnitus in the most boring way possible. </p> <p><strong>Lad-rock crowds</strong></p> <p>Here we're talking bands who play your bog-standard, chart-friendly indie rock (the Fratellis, Pigeon Detectives et al). The formula? Dumb guitar riffs, lyrics about girls and shoutalong choruses designed specifically to give grown men an excuse to neck lager and rub their bits against other men for an hour and a half without fear of being labelled \"a gay\". A Pigeon Detectives gig last year even involved a wet T-shirt competition - proof, if proof were needed, that this is not the best place to catch discussions on the work of Michel Foucault. \"This is an emergency,\" sang said band on a recent single. And you know what? They were right.

  "<p>It's a wet afternoon in Anstruther and James Yorkston is perched on the bonnet of his car looking out to sea, blinking through the rain as he works his way through a vinegary bag of chips. It's a perfect setting for this returning folk hero - a man whose romantic songs are grounded in briny, everyday details. The musician has just moved back home from Edinburgh to the East Neuk of Fife, to be closer to King Creosote's highly influential Fence Collective, the group of local musicians with whom he grew up and which spawned, among others, the Beta Band and KT Tunstall.</p> <p>Yorkston laughs gently as raindrops collect in his sparse ginger hair. \"I love this place. When I moved back here, it was like that phrase old Scottish ladies say, 'Ooh, it's like a weiiiight has been taken off my shoulders!'\" He smiles. \"There was no background noise, no interference. My head was clear. I feel more disconnected from the music business than ever - in a good way. I'm purely thinking about the writing rather than anything else.\" </p> <p>And what writing it is. Over four subtle, gorgeous albums, Yorkston has helped broaden the reach of folk music in the 21st century, somehow managing to please the old folk guard, lovers of experimental music and the indie fan. Take his new album, Where the Haar Rolls In: not only does it include contributions from folk giants Norma and Mike Waterson, but it shimmers with the sounds of bouzoukis, prepared pianos (altered by placing objects on or between the strings) and even wine glasses. And it also comes with an endorsement from Radiohead's drummer, Phil Selway. \"Listening to James Yorkston's music is like coming across the interesting-looking person on the fringes of the party,\" he says.</p> <p>But Yorkston wasn't always quiet. In his youth, his tastes were raucous and his spirit rebellious. Born in 1971, he loved punk and hardcore groups such as the Damned, Agent Orange and Dag Nasty. He played in \"noisy, distorted guitar bands\" and spent his 20s doing odd jobs in bookshops and hotels while trying to hit the big time in groups called Miraclehead and Huckleberry. By the time he was 28, he'd had enough. He opted for what he calls self-imposed exile: going back to school to study, dropping the bands, and making music just for himself. \"It was desperation,\" he says over a lager after we've moved to a pub. \"It was a case of telling myself: you've got to grow up, go and study, make a career, and just record things at home on your guitar. If the songs don't go anywhere, at least you'll have a nice reminder of your youth.\" He smiles. \"Thankfully, things didn't turn out that way.\" </p> <p>Yorkston started to explore. He went back to the traditional songs of his childhood holidays in Cork and started spending more time in Anstruther, inspired by his friends' approach to music-making. Watching the likes of Kenny Anderson, the founder of Fence and also known as King Creosote, and his brother Gordon, a founder of the Beta Band, Yorkston was struck by their \"music that was so loose and so open. I suddenly realised this was the way music should be done.\"</p> <p>So in 1999, Yorkston recorded some demos, including the song Moving Up Country, Roaring the Gospel, still a staple of his live shows. He sent a tape to John Peel, who played it: \"I was ecstatic. Peel said it was his favourite song title of the year.\" Things started to happen. Yorkston recorded a Peel session and Scottish label Bad Jazz released Moving Up Country as a single. The mighty John Martyn then asked Yorkston to support him on a 27-date tour, and soon Yorkston was signed to Domino Records. His first album, also called Moving Up Country, was an instant critical success, becoming the Rough Trade chain's album of 2002.</p> <p>The title When the Haar Rolls In is an honest reflection of the despair Yorkston has felt in his life: the haar is the North Sea fog that often swamps Anstruther. \"Imagine the combination of a vicious dry ice machine and air conditioning that soaks you to the skin,\" says Yorkston. \"It always comes, it's just a question of when.\" He follows this dour observation with a smile, reflecting how the woe in his songs - which crackle with the brutal honesty of folk - is always tempered by wit.</p> <p>Such admissions aside, this is a good time in Yorkston's life. Last year, he got married; next month, they're expecting their first baby. Yorkston also seems liberated by the fact that Domino has allowed him to produce this album himself, after the Cocteau Twins' Simon Raymonde helped him with Moving Up Country. So is he pleased everything is going his way? He laughs. \"That's one way to put it. More than anything, though, I do feel free. I'm not worried, I feel calm. Everything is going as it should\" \u00b7</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Where the Haar Rolls In is released on September 1.

  "<p>I was one of 30 people - from the 500-strong gathering of anti-BNP protesters - allowed within Derbyshire constabulary's 1.5-mile \"official protest area\". Tightly controlled under sections 14 and 14a of the Public Order Act and under constant surveillance, we marched up Denby Lane to the Bungalow, the hilltop site of the BNP's \"Red, White, and Blue festival\" (Czech far-right party activist to address BNP, August 16).</p> <p>Heavily flanked by police, the half-mile walk was uneventful. My arthritis slowed me down somewhat (I'm 66). A police helicopter clattered overhead, and after passing the Bungalow we reached a grass verge, where some protesters were interviewed by the local press. After 10 minutes we walked back down the hill, again past the Bungalow; \"festival security\" filmed us from the gateway, and further down a few vehicle drivers, irritated by being slowed up, treated us to some foul language, while four middle-aged men at a pub jeered at us to \"get a job\", before we rejoined the main demonstration.</p> <p>At no point did my wife and I, our comrades from Stoke-on-Trent or most of the hundreds at this protest see stones thrown, or arrests made. Indeed the assistant chief constable of Derbyshire said our behaviour was \"impeccable\". But what media reports there have been about the demonstrations focused only on disorderly events, and missed the fact that the vast majority of people taking part in marches of this type are law-abiding citizens, most with jobs and responsibilities, who worry about the rise of far-right politics in Britain, and in Europe.</p> <p>I fear that this type of reporting may discourage many people from attending such events, as does the constant surveillance filming by police units.</p> <p>My father, Charles Edward Honeysett, 1899-1982, served on the western front in 1918, spoke at open-air meetings and demonstrated against fascism in the 1930s, and had to serve Britain for six more years after being called up in 1939; for his sacrifice alone I have no alternative but to continue joining with all those good people with social consciences, and try to raise awareness of the ignorance, divisiveness and racism behind the BNP's \"mask of respectability\".<br><strong>Jon Honeysett</strong><br>Stoke-on-Trent </p> <p>I don't want to spoil anyone's fun, but I experience a \"whirlpool effect\" every time I see Cliff Richard/Bucks Fizz \"perform\" (Doherty banned from performing at festival, August 20).

  "<p>The public address system on the shuttle between Gatwick's north and south terminals urges passengers to take advantage of the value offered by shops in the departure lounge. But the customers told a different story, with the costs of using the airport a major gripe.</p> <p>\"The shops are too expensive; I don't buy anything,\" said Bridget Comyns, originally from Northern Ireland but now living in England. But despite expensive shops and her family being stuck in a lengthy queue at the easyJet check-in for a Belfast flight, she said that she \"didn't mind\" Gatwick.</p> <p>\"It always seems to be just shops [at airports]\" said Yvette Gowdie, 36, who was relying on a free paper for entertainment as she waited for her delayed flight to Jamaica. \"When you're travelling, you already do your shopping before you come here. There are too many shops.\"</p> <p>She believed more lifts should be a priority for new owners and that foreign visitors would find the slowness of getting through the airport \"amazing\" - in a bad way.</p> <p>Most people the Guardian spoke to at Gatwick yesterday cited the convenience of getting to the airport and a swift transit through it as the most important factors. They were less interested in the shopping.</p> <p>While Tuesday morning is by no means a peak period, the number of shops with few or any customers seemed to back up that view. But for BAA the rental incomes from stores remain a golden goose, to the extent that it has been accused in the past of deliberately slowing passengers' movement through the airport to encourage them to spend more money.</p> <p>Tristan Millington-Drake, 52, a businessman who had dropped off a friend at the airport but is a frequent user of Gatwick, proclaimed the airport \"absolutely fine\" and was sceptical about what benefits a new operator could deliver. He pointed out that it was unlikely a new operator would come in and slash costs for airlines or travellers, who face paying more than \u00a35 for a sandwich and drink, and more than \u00a39 a day if they want to park their car. </p> <p>\"That the government is interfering [with BAA] ... seems ridiculous when they were the ones who offered it [the licence to operate Gatwick and other UK airports] in the first place,\" he said.</p> <p>But Johnny Cordiner, 42, sitting in the same coffee shop nearby, could not have disagreed more strongly. He was returning home to Edinburgh, via Gatwick, from Vancouver, where the airport offered a \"more pleasant experience\". He had complaints about all three of BAA's London airports, from the security queues at Stansted to the delays caused by air-traffic congestion at Heathrow and his failure to find an internet cafe with a printer at Gatwick. </p> <p>Cordiner said a forced disposal \"could only be a good thing. They [BAA] have embraced some of the worst things about pseudo-state ownership.\"</p>",
  "<p>With a title like Why They're Dying in Congo (World Service), Mark Doyle's two-part documentary wasn't going to be an easy listen.

A thousand kilometres upstream from Kinshasa, a young woman lay covered in blood in a canoe. \"She's just had a miscarriage,\" Doyle explained. In the background, as a doctor tried to stem the bleeding, was her fast, shallow, pained breathing and the sound of villagers baling water out of her boat. It was an extraordinary close-up. \"She needs a lot of antibiotics,\" the doctor said, \"and there is no pharmacy here.\" The BBC crew towed her to a health centre hours away. \"She might be able to sell her fish and buy some antibiotics,\" her friend suggested, further illuminating the desperate situation.</p> <p>These terrific documentaries answered the question they began with, but left another: with preventable death on this scale in Congo, why isn't anything being done to help?</p>",
  "<p>It took a year for the love affair between fans and the Apple iPhone to sour. The original iPhone was greeted with round-the-block queues and near-universal praise. But its 3G successor has not fared quite so well. Within a fortnight of going on sale, complaints started to appear online from users who found the handset could not make it through the day without a recharge. The 2G iPhone was designed to last for eight hours of normal use; on anecdotal evidence, the 3G version gets about five hours.</p> <p>On top of that, people in the US and in some other countries found that their handsets kept dropping calls. Blogger <a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/iphone3\">Darlene McNeill</a> claimed she went from a Nokia Series 60 phone to the 3G iPhone and back in less than two weeks because the battery life \"just couldn't cut it\".</p> <p>Yet, in its tests with consumers, Strategy Analytics found the iPhone's battery held up well, although 3G phones generally do not last as long on one charge as 2G handsets. Standby time on the phone is average for a 3G handset; talk time is generally better. \"As a phone, it's in the right ball park,\" says Neil Mawston, associate director at Strategy Analytics.</p> <p>The iPhone's power problem revolves around its big selling point: how it handles data and internet access. Apple built a device that makes people want to use those services, but they suck the life out of the battery. Apple was perhaps not prepared for the users who love the iPhone too much. \"Because it is such a feature-rich device, people are using more of the functions than they would on a smartphone-type device,\" reckons Doug McEuen, senior analyst at ABI Research.</p> <p>\"Traditional [mobile] phones have been designed to cope just with voice and SMS. The iPhone came along with lots of data-intensive applications and features and they, naturally, consume more battery power,\" Mawston says.</p> <p><strong>Running on empty</strong></p> <p>Manufacturers do not yet understand how data usage affects battery life. \"It is going to be trial-and-error at this stage,\" says McEuen. Some weaknesses could just be own goals. Gartner analyst Ken Delaney found a weak spot in how the iPhone deals with email pushed from servers running Microsoft Exchange.</p> <p>\"We seldom experienced a full day of use,\" Delaney wrote in a <a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/iphone4\">report</a> on iPhone use for business. That was with limited browsing and no telephone calls (Note: paid-for report).</p> <p>Apple is not alone. Microsoft had to fix its version of Exchange for push email on Windows Mobile because of a similar problem, according to Delaney. Firmware changes are likely to address some of the <a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/iphone5\">applications</a> that drain the battery, and Apple urges users to keep the product up-to-date for this reason.</p> <p>A firmware update could also solve the problem of dropped calls, although 3G experts are unsure whether the breaks in service are down to the wireless networks, the phone or interactions between the two. <a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/iphone6\">T-Mobile</a> in the Netherlands at first blamed the phone, then claimed the problem is still under investigation. In the UK, O2 says it tested the phone extensively before launch but found no appreciable difference in behaviour to other phones.</p> <p>Francis Sideco, an analyst at iSuppli, says Apple and others have to go further to improve the performance of handsets and make software energy-aware. As more people use the data services, they are going to find their handsets running out of juice unless the manufacturers can find power savings: \"They have accelerometers in there, so they can detect if the phone has moved at all. If it hasn't moved, there is no need to get an update from the GPS.\"</p> <p>With its $275m (\u00a3148m) purchase of chip-design company PA Semi in June, Apple indicated it wants to have much more control over the iPhone hardware and power efficiency is the most likely beneficiary.</p> <p>Allan Yogasingam, technology analyst at TechOnline, says the purchase is a major change in direction for a company that prefers to use off-the-shelf silicon, often using older parts to keep costs down. Don Scansen, technology analyst at Semiconductor Insights, agrees: \"Apple's value is all about the software. They don't need cutting-edge technology to do it.\"</p> <p>Apple's decision to delve into processor design appears to be tied to an unusual <a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/iphone7\">licence deal</a> that ARM revealed at the end of July. Apple will not say whether it took out the licence and ARM chief executive Warren East says the mystery licensee demanded confidentiality.</p> <p>An architecture licence makes it possible for designers to alter the inner workings of the processor, although they cannot sacrifice binary compatibility with other ARM cores. Almost all chipmakers prefer to buy the ready-made designs produced by ARM. \"We offer this as a choice,\" East says. \"You can see by the number of architectural licences that we have that we don't go out of our way to sell them.\"</p> <p>In 1995, Digital Equipment became the first company to buy an ARM architecture licence. The result was the <a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/iphone8\">StrongARM</a>. This processor ran four times faster than the ARM processors but needed 40% less power to run each instruction. </p> <p>Dan Dobberpuhl, a processor designer, led the Digital team up to its 1999 sale to Intel, where the StrongARM mutated into the XScale. Founding PA in 2005, Dobberpuhl recruited a number of the original project's engineers to help build the 150-strong chip-design company. Almost 15 years later, the PA team looks ready to repeat the feat.</p> <p>Jim Tully, vice-president at consultancy Gartner, speculates: \"If they found a way of really reducing the power dissipation such that other companies had to go to a new generation of silicon to get the same power reduction, that would allow Apple to stay on a lower-cost technology for longer.\"</p> <p>Sideco points to the new generation of multicore processors as a way of making the hardware more efficient. Apple wants its Grand Central project to improve software speed on Macs by spreading the workload across processors. In a mobile device, there is another option. If each processor can run slower because many of them are working in parallel, you can design them to use far less power. And you can turn off processor cores completely if the phone is just ticking over.</p> <p><strong>Lower cruise speeds</strong></p> <p>\"The car companies have done the same thing. If you are cruising down the highway, they shut down four out of the eight cylinders to save fuel,\" Sideco explains.</p> <p>Designing the new processor chip will take time. Linley Gwennap of The Linley Group, an analyst, says: \"For this sort of chip, it could take anywhere from one year to two years to get to having the first test chips. It's closer to three years before I would expect to see an iPhone that had any kind of Apple-designed chip in there.\"</p> <p>The project could cost between $40m and $60m, Gwennap estimates, based on the amount PA raised from venture capitalists to design its first processor. </p> <p>Despite the credentials of the PA team, Gwennap says it is hard to see how Apple could really steal a march on other experienced chipmakers: \"There are a lot of smart people focusing on low power at a lot of companies.\"</p> <p>By designing its own processor - possibly with many ARM cores onboard - Apple may be able to use its control over the iPhone software to achieve power savings that users of off-the-shelf silicon cannot. In the meantime, Apple will have to provide smarter software to deliver the battery life heavy users of the internet demand.</p>",
  "<p>Brian Barwick is to become the fourth chief executive to depart the Football Association within a decade after serious differences of opinion with the company's first independent chairman, Lord Triesman, about the philosophy behind his role proved irreconcilable. </p> <p>Relations between the pair have been strained since Lord Triesman was appointed at the beginning of the year, with the chief executive increasingly ostracised while the chairman conducted his root and branch re-structuring of the governing body. Barwick, a former television executive with BBC and ITV, has agreed a pay-off on his \u00a3450,000-a-year rolling 12-month contract and will depart Soho Square on December 31. </p> <p>The pair surveyed last night's friendly international against the Czech Republic from the stands with the FA anxious to stress that Barwick had not been sacked from the position he took up in January 2005. Rather, with their definitions of what duties should befall the chief executive so at odds and unlikely to be reconciled, compromise had been reached for the former ITV Controller of Sport to relinquish the position at the end of the year. It remains to be seen whether Triesman, who already has the recently appointed Alex Horne as his chief operating officer, will now seek a replacement. </p> <p>In some ways it was appropriate that news of Barwick's imminent departure should leak out while England were striding on to the turf at the national stadium. Arguably his greatest achievement in the role has been the re-opening of Wembley Stadium, the development of which was smoothed by Barwick when a dispute some two years ago between Wembley National Stadium Limited and the builder, Multiplex, threatened to destroy the stadium operator and prevent the completion of construction. </p> <p>Although he also secured an increase in television revenues from the recent deal struck with the broadcasters ITV and Setanta and gained the agreement for the National Football Centre at Burton, Barwick may be remembered more for the disastrous appointment of Steve McClaren as Sven Goran Eriksson's successor after the 2006 World Cup finals. The FA's torturous attempts to lure Luiz Felipe Scolari from his position with Portugal were conducted excruciatingly in the public eye. </p> <p>Indeed, Barwick was spotted flying to meet the Brazilian, then later claimed he had never offered Scolari the job once it became clear that he wished to remain with Portugal. When McClaren was unveiled the chief executive's assertion that Eriksson's No2 had always been the FA's \"first choice\" fooled few, with the subsequent failure to reach Euro 2008 costing the association around \u00a35m in lost revenue. Barwick was also forced to negotiate a \u00a32.5m pay-off with McClaren.</p> <p>Even in the wake of that failure, he did receive the full backing of the FA board. He had sat flanked by the Premier League chairman Sir Dave Richards, his Football League counterpart Lord Mawhinney, the then FA chairman Geoff Thompson, the Manchester United chief executive David Gill and the FA vice-chairman Barry Bright at a press conference called at Soho Square to announce the termination of McClaren's contract and received their full public backing. \"Brian has taken a lot of stick about him being the sole person to appoint McClaren,\" said Richards at the time. \"This responsibility has to be shared among us all. It's unfair to say he was Brian's man - he was the FA's man.\" </p> <p>Yet, since Lord Triesman's arrival, that support from the top appears to have been steadily eroded. The chairman has effectively been acting as a full-time executive chairman - admittedly a role he does not envisage fulfilling long-term - and had made it clear privately that he doubted whether Barwick boasted the necessary business skills to modernise the FA, with Triesman's re-structuring blueprint, issued in May, effectively serving to marginalise the chief executive. </p> <p>It remains to be seen whether Fabio Capello, the man to whom Barwick turned as McClaren's successor, can arrest the apparent decline of the national team, yet the chief executive will watch any progress from afar. He will depart without the controversy that blighted the exits of Mark Palios, Adam Crozier and Graham Kelly, his three predecessors. Yet, while his differences with Triesman had been rumbling on disconcertingly in the background, the relatively abrupt nature of his exit represents something of a surprise.</p>",
  "<p>With one day of Olympic sailing remaining, the team went to their beds here last night hoping that Iain Percy and Andrew Simpson in the Star class would win a medal, preferably a fourth gold, to make this the most successful British sailing team in Olympic history. </p> <p>Bryony Shaw's bronze in the women's windsurfing yesterday took the overall tally of five medals, level with that gained in both Athens and Sydney, and they might have made it six yesterday had Nick Dempsey, in with a chance of a medal in the men's windsurfing, not fallen foul of the endemically capricious wind conditions on this part of the Chinese coast.</p> <p>\"Control the controllables\" is a phrase often used by Stephen Park, the team manager, but when the winds shift about with a fickleness that is beyond the power of all but a clairvoyant to predict, matters can quickly go wrong and they did for Dempsey, who won a bronze medal in Athens. He finished seventh in his medal race and that was enough to drop him to fourth overall. To make matters worse his race was cut short for no other reason - or so it seemed - than because television wanted it that way, the previous women's race having lasted longer than expected.</p> <p>\"I was surprised,\" said Dempsey, who was none the wiser after his race had finished. \"It was an important race so it wasn't proper. I don't think I did anything wrong. When it's close you can only do your best. It's so difficult when it comes down to one short race and it was always going to be tough.\" </p> <p>Last Sunday he had seen his wife-to-be, Sarah Ayton, steer her Yngling crew - Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson - to gold, so failing to win a medal was particularly difficult. All had looked so good before this race with only one point separating him from a possible gold.</p> <p>Shaw, who won the test regatta here last year, was briefly in the gold position during her medal race, although bronze was always the more likely outcome. And she was as delighted with this as Dempsey was distressed with his outcome. \"It was really hard. The wind switched and it became a pumping race and that played in my favour,\" said Shaw who finished second in the last race for third overall. \"The colour of my medal was decided by how the others sailed but I am so relieved after an up-and-down week.\" Italy's Alessandra Sensini took the silver with the gold going to China's Jian Yin, her country's first in sailing. And huge were the celebrations here where even the manhole covers proclaim 'Qingdao, sailing city'.</p> <p>Shaw, no doubt to the delight of thousands of children at home, and the BBC, was carrying her Blue Peter badge, as she has throughout these Olympics: \"I taught one of the presenters, Zoe [Salmon], how to windsurf and she presented me with it and said it was my lucky charm. It worked. When I started windsurfing it was a hobby and I enjoyed the lifestyle. Then it became an Olympic dream. Now I've achieved that with a medal. I just feel so lucky.\"</p> <p>The same could not be said of Dempsey, who initially was inconsolable. He had been so desperately close to all three medals that to lose out, especially when the team spirits were so buoyant, was triply galling. Four years of exceptionally hard work had disappeared in a puff of wind, or rather the lack of it, although a smile returned to his face at the thought of competing in four years' time at his home town of Weymouth. There the conditions for London 2012 will give all the Skandia GB sailors the optimum chance of building on their formidable success of the last three Olympic Games where, prior to today, they have won 15 medals, including eight gold.</p>",
  "<p>According to Julian Critchley, the former civil servant responsible for coordinating the government's anti-drug policy, the legalisation of drugs would be less harmful than the current strategy - and an \"overwhelming majority\" of professionals share his view (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/13/drugs.legislation\">Ex-drugs policy director calls for legalisation</a>, August 13). </p> <p>\"All those intelligent, knowledgeable people were forced to repeat the nonsensical mantra that the government would be 'tough on drugs', even though they all knew the government's policy was actually causing harm,\" he says.</p> <p>Perhaps Critchley moved in different circles to the ones in which I do - I'm a consultant to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime and a former chief constable. But I believe his assertions are stunningly inaccurate, and his justification for legalising drugs - because of the alleged hypocrisy of the government's position - is astonishing. Surely a better argument would be to call for an improved policy rather than the imposition of an immense additional burden on a society that manifestly opposes the misuse of illegal, mind-altering drugs.</p> <p>Globally, fewer than 6% of those aged 15-64 use drugs, and of those who have the misfortune to be dependent on them, all indications are that they would opt for treatment aimed at freedom from drugs rather than a laissez-faire policy of unrestricted access and maintenance. A massive increase in addictions would be the corollary of legalisation. Government \"hypocrisy\" is not a justification for burdening society with increased addictions, and it is naive to believe that the legalisation of drugs would reduce crime.</p> <p>Does Critchley want crack to be legally available? Or if not all drugs, then which should be available, and to whom? Could anyone acquire them? And if not, does Critchley not think there would be a thriving black market to undercut prices and avoid taxes? </p> <p>Critchley states that the use of tobacco is declining, and \"precisely because it is legal, its users are far more amenable to government control, education programmes and taxation\". If so, why are alcohol and tobacco products a major smuggling problem? He fails to apply his argument to alcohol abuse, which is skyrocketing in the UK.</p> <p>Not only that, but any government abdicating from its agreements under international conventions would find legalisation almost impossible to achieve: the amount of administration, manufacturing, storage and security for the products would be enormous.</p> <p>The cumulative effects of prohibition, combined with education and treatment during 100 years of international drug control, have had a significant impact in stemming the drug problem. Control is working, and we do not know how much worse the problem would have become without it. The compassionate approach to drugs is to do everything to reduce addiction, not to make it easier. Imagine the consequences of widespread bingeing on drugs.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Dr Ian Oliver was chief constable of Grampian police until 1998.

  "<p>As the focus this week turned to Barack Obama's choice of running mate, his other crucial partner continues to show that the Democratic nominee isn't the only Obama breaking down barriers. Michelle Obama is well on her way to becoming the first African-American first lady. But in a country that has a long way to go in terms of racial and gender justice, her reception has been far from warm. In the wake of the rank misogyny directed at Hillary Clinton throughout her campaign, it's time for American feminists to defend Michelle Obama with the same passion and vigour: the attacks are worse and the consequences more dire.</p> <p>Media coverage of Obama has packed a nasty racism-sexism combo that is quickly becoming a national disgrace. First a Fox News segment captioned a picture of Michelle as \"Obama's Baby Mama\", a disparaging term for unmarried mothers. Rightwing commentators have called her an \"angry black woman\" and \"Obama's bitter half\", while the National Review ran a cover story dubbing her \"Mrs Grievance\". Then came the notorious, if satirical, New Yorker cover, where she was featured as having a large Afro and toting a machine gun. </p> <p>Like it or not, it matters what the American public thinks of Michelle Obama. A recent poll showed 61% of Americans say the potential first lady plays a role in how they vote.</p> <p>While there has been positive media - such as Michelle Obama's appearance on TV and on magazine covers - the underlying messages put out by the press reek of racism, sexism, and of a country unable, or unwilling, to see a black woman in a position of power. As one Washington Post commentator, Sophia A Nelson, wrote, for women who face this daily, it is far from shocking. \"We're endlessly familiar with the problem she is confronting - being looked at, as black women, through a different lens from our white counterparts, who are portrayed as kinder, gentler souls who somehow deserve to be loved and valued more than we do.\" </p> <p>Thankfully, this assault isn't going entirely unchecked. Blogs such as Michelle Obama Watch are holding news outlets accountable for inaccurate, sexist and racist characterisations. But that's not enough. It's time for feminists in the mainstream movement, many of whom are still stinging over Clinton's loss, to not just pull out all the stops for Barack, but to also use their considerable political power, money and influence to defend Michelle. </p> <p>When Clinton was still campaigning I received daily emails from various women's organisations, furious about the way the media was treating their candidate. These days, however, my inbox is fairly empty. And the press releases and action alerts I do get about Michelle Obama seem to lack the outrage and fervour of past Clinton-focused statements.</p> <p>That's not to say women's organisations aren't up to the task. The National Organisation for Women, for instance, has shifted the focus of their Media Hall of Shame to attacks on Obama. But feminists should be up in arms. Because as shameful as the treatment they're getting is, our silence is even more so. </p> <p>Michelle Obama recently told a room full of women that \"[we] need an advocate in the White House now more than ever before\". And after eight years of the Bush administration, truer words were never spoken. But Michelle Obama also needs an advocate in us. </p> <p>We have an opportunity to show the world that racism and sexism are not acceptable, that they have no place in public discourse, and that those with power will not just speak out against injustice - but will scream, full volume. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jessica Valenti is the founder of Feministing website and author of Full Frontal Feminism <a href=\"http://www.feministing.com\">feministing.com</a></p>",

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-336795497\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>At least 153 people were dead last night after a plane departing from Madrid's Barajas airport swerved off the runway and burst into flames. The Spanair aircraft, a McDonnell Douglas MD-82 carrying 172 passengers and crew to the Canary Islands, was attempting to take off when it developed a fault. One of its engines was said to have been in flames shortly before the incident. </p> <p>More than 300 firefighters, paramedics and police called to the crash were confronted by a grim scene. \"The plane was completely broken and full of bodies,\" one airport worker told El Pais.</p> <p>\"There is nothing left of the plane; it is totally burned,\" said a civil guard officer. \"It's the closest to hell I've ever seen. The corpses were boiling and we were burned as we retrieved them.\"</p> <p>Some reports suggested that 20 children and two infants were among the dead.</p> <p>Smoke filled the air around the airport and could be seen eight miles away in Madrid city centre. Helicopters were called in to dump water on the burning fuselage as desperate attempts were made to rescue survivors. A makeshift morgue was being set up at Madrid's main convention centre, officials said. </p> <p>The Spanish development minister, Magdalena Alvarez, whose department is in charge of civil aviation, confirmed that 153 people had been killed, with 19 survivors. A Spanish emergency rescue official said many of the survivors were in a critical condition in hospital. </p> <p>It was Spain's deadliest air disaster since 1983, when a Boeing 747 operated by the Colombian airline Avianca crashed near Madrid on its landing approach, killing 181 people. </p> <p>Alvarez said yesterday's crash was an accident, but confirmed earlier reports that the plane had aborted one takeoff for checks, then later tried a second takeoff.</p> <p>Earlier reports in Spain gave differing accounts of the likely cause of the crash. The newspaper El Mundo reported that the plane had broken in two after coming off the runway, with witnesses describing \"a ball of flame\". El Pais, quoting a source with the national airport authority, Aena, said the plane's departure had been delayed due to technical problems and was \"probably caused\" by faults with the engine. The plane only just managed to lift off the runway before crashing, the official said.</p> <p>Consuelo Cabrera, the grandmother of one passenger, said that shortly before the accident he phoned her to say that the plane \"had experienced problems\" before departure, and that the passengers were waiting to see whether they would have to change planes. She said she had since been unable to contact her grandson, Marcos Hern\u00e1ndez, 22, who was travelling with his girlfriend. </p> <p>Other reports suggested that the plane crashed after its second attempted takeoff, leaving skid marks across the runaway. According to Aena, it had been due to take off almost two hours before the accident, at about 13.05 local time. The crash happened at 14.45.</p> <p>Last night the Foreign Office was unable to say whether there had been British passengers on board the plane, a codeshare flight to Las Palmas with Lufthansa's LH255. \"We are on our way to the airport to check the flight list,\" a spokeswoman for the British embassy in Madrid said. </p> <p>Distraught families of those thought to have been on the flight gathered in terminal 2 at Barajas airport, pleading for information. At Las Palmas airport on the island of Gran Canaria, more families gathered. Some were escorted into a room away from the press and comforted by Red Cross psychiatrists. </p> <p>Spanair said it would not release the names of the passengers until their relatives were informed.</p> <p>The prime minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, broke off his holiday in southern Spain to return to Madrid, heading straight for the airport. </p> <p>Accident investigators will be examining the debris in the coming days.</p> <p>Last night TV and radio stations in Spain were asking questions of Spanair, the country's second largest airline carrier, which is known for its ageing fleet of aircraft. Radio Punto, quoting a former pilot, said the airline had a good safety record. </p> <p>In a statement on the its website, Spanair said only that it \"regretted to confirm\" that one of its planes had been involved in the incident. </p> <p>Four days ago a Spanair flight from Lanzarote made an unexpected stop in Gran Canaria after it got into difficulties; the company later said that it had been a maintenance stop rather than emergency landing. Reports at the time questioned the safety of the plane, also a McDonnell Douglas MD-82. It was not clear last night whether the incident involved the same aircraft as that which crashed yesterday.</p> <p>Sergio Allar, Spanair's commercial director, said the company had \"as yet no information\" to release about the crash, adding: \"We cannot speculate. The investigation is the responsibility of the civil aviation [authority].\"</p> <h2>Inquiry may focus on reports of fire in left engine</h2> <p>The focus of the investigation into yesterday's crash may concentrate on one of the plane's engines. Reports suggested the aircraft that crashed at Barajas airport was on a second attempt to take off, although it was unclear at what stage the first attempt was abandoned. The aircraft apparently managed to get airborne but some eyewitnesses reported an explosion and there was said to have been a fire on the left-hand engine which caused the aircraft to crash and its fuselage to break up. </p> <p>Kieran Daly, the editor of Flight International, said it would be premature to speculate on the cause of the accident, but in the absence of dangerous weather conditions a likely source of the problem could be inferred, whether or not the witness reports were accurate. </p> <p>\"Accidents on takeoff are relatively rare,\" he said. \"The obvious suspicion is some kind of engine problem. The suspicion is that for whatever reason the aircraft had insufficient power to pull away.\" </p> <p>The plane that crashed was a McDonnell Douglas MD-82. Daly said there had been \"one or two nasty accidents\" with the MD-80 series where the engines were to blame. While in general terms the most likely cause could be described as a \"mechanical failure\" the list of specific problems with the engine could be \"endless\". Daly said he was puzzled because the aircraft should have been able to pull away on one engine. </p> <p>It was confirmed last night that five experts from the United States' National Transportation Safety Board would be flying in to assist the Spanish investigation.</p> <p>There are 861 models of the MD-80 series still in service with a total of 57 airlines. The design first came into service in the 1980s. </p> <p>In March, two US carriers, American Airlines and Delta, voluntarily grounded their fleets of MD-80s while their wiring was reinspected for compliance with federal maintenance rules. </p> <p>At the time, analysts stressed that the move did not indicate the planes were unsafe, but they said that it nonetheless raised questions about their reliability given that the planes were ageing. </p> <p>The MD-80 series is rated the second safest in the world by AirDisaster.com, with nine incidents in some 20m flights where a fatality was recorded that was \"solely due to the operation of an aircraft\".</p> <p>The MD-82 carries a maximum of 172 passengers, and has a cruising speed of 504mph with Pratt &amp; Whitney engines. </p> <p>Spanair is a small operator catering for the tourist market which runs a number of charter flights. The company is owned by the Scandinavian carrier SAS.</p>",
  "<p>Bumper revenues from North Sea oil companies boosted Britain's public coffers last month, but analysts still believe that the government has little hope of meeting its borrowing target for the year.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said the Treasury had a surplus of \u00a34.8bn last month, slightly higher than the City's expectations. Corporation tax from North Sea operators accounted for 40% of the \u00a39.9bn tax receipts in July, more than making up for a fall in onshore revenue. </p> <p>Government borrowing in the first quarter of the financial year was the highest in any quarter since records began in 1946 and analysts said July's surplus did not alter the trend. July is traditionally a surplus month in the public finances calendar due to the timing of tax receipts. </p> <p>Matthew Sharratt, an economist at Bank of America, said: \"The surplus is slightly bigger than expected but the key thing is that the deteriorating trend in public borrowing is stark.\" </p> <p>The chancellor of the exchequer, Alistair Darling, forecast in the March budget that the UK would need to borrow \u00a343bn to balance the books this year, raising debt to 38.5% of national income. Under Gordon Brown's sustainable investment rule, it should be no more than 40%. At the end of July, debt was \u00a3542.6bn - the equivalent of 37.3% of gross domestic product.</p> <p>But several economists expect the final figure to be much higher. \"The full-year figures are going to be significantly worse than the chancellor's forecast of \u00a343bn,\" Jonathan Loynes at Capital Economics said. \"Possibly \u00a350bn or \u00a360bn even.\"</p> <p>John Hawksworth, head of macroeconomics at PricewaterhouseCoopers, believes that the deficit could \"easily reach \u00a350bn or more this year even before considering any possible spending overshoot (which seems quite likely in areas like debt interest and social security benefits that are less readily controllable by the Treasury)\".</p> <p>The shadow chancellor, George Osborne, said: \"These dreadful figures show that borrowing is out of control. One test of a fair society is that we do not leave our children to pay our debts, and this fiscal irresponsibility is not just reckless, it is deeply unfair on future generations.</p> <p>\"Gordon Brown has failed to put aside money for a rainy day during the good years, and taxpayers will bear the price for his economic incompetence.\"</p>",

  "<p>Ericsson is putting its wireless microchip business into a joint venture with its Franco-Italian rival STMicroelectronics as the companies look to expand their customer base in the face of slowing mobile phone sales.</p> <p>The new business, which will be jointly run by the two firms, will be number three in the mobile chip industry behind the US leaders Qualcomm and Texas Instruments. Based in Geneva, the as yet unnamed venture will employ nearly 8,000 people in a unit that last year would have generated $3.6bn (\u00a31.9bn) in revenues.</p> <p>The deal was warmly welcomed by Nokia, one of the venture's key customers, as \"a positive move\" that would create a \"strong industry player\". Analysts, however, pointed out that the Finnish firm, which makes four out of every 10 handsets sold worldwide, is no fan of Qualcomm, having been embroiled in bitter legal disputes with the US firm, and a stronger European rival would suit the company.</p> <p>Ericsson is putting its mobile platforms business, which specialises in modems and designing multimedia phones, and $1.1bn in cash into the venture. STMicroelectronics, created just last month through the merger of STMicro's mobile phone chip business with NXP Semiconductors of the Netherlands, will put in its wireless chip-design business, worth an estimated $1.2bn.</p> <p>The venture will supply chips for handsets ranging from bottom-of-the-range pre-pay phones to the next generation of internet-enabled multimedia devices. As well as Nokia, the new venture will count SonyEricsson, Samsung, LG and Sharp as its major customers. The only one of the top five handset makers the venture does not supply is the US-based Motorola.</p> <p>Ericsson's chief executive, Carl-Henric Svanberg, will be chairman of the board of the business and STMicroelectronics' chief executive, Carlo Bozotti, will be vice-chairman. </p> <p>The deal comes as sales of mobile phones begin to show some signs of slowing down and there is consolidation in other parts of the industry. Last month, for instance, Nokia took control of the British mobile phone software company Symbian. Nokia helped create the business, with the UK-based Psion, 10 years ago.</p> <p>Yesterday's deal will allow Ericsson to focus on its telecoms networks business, which has suffered as the credit crunch bites and operators rein in spending.</p> <p>Analysts warned that the venture could be bad news for the UK-based Arm Holdings, which designs processor chips for mobiles. Nick James at Panmure Gordon said the deal - along with STMicro's acquisition of NXP - represents \"a pretty intense wave of consolidation\". </p> <p>Though the deal does not directly challenge Arm's position as the dominant processor architecture for mobile phones, he said, \"it does reduce the number of potential licensees and may put further pressure on Arm's licensing revenue.\"</p>",

Earlier plans to protect \"strategically important industries\" were dropped.</p> <p>Nevertheless, leading centre-right politicians insist that it should be used to control investments in infrastructure such as airports, railways , ports, gas and electricity grids, and telecoms.</p> <p>The new law is seen as a direct response to the rise of SWF, which, through the oil and commodity boom, are now estimated to control $3.85tr (\u00a32tr) in assets.</p> <p>Glos's ministry said SWFs tended to acquire far lower stakes in firms than the 25% minimum set out in the new law.</p> <p>Several have been bailing out US and European banks such as UBS and Citigroup, crippled by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/subprimecrisis\">the sub-prime crisis</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">credit crunch</a>. German cabinet approval of the draft law came as Merrill Lynch courted fund capital in South Korea.</p> <p>Germany has welcomed such moves but its legislation was initially triggered by the 5% stake in the aerospace group <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/eads\">EADS</a> taken by a Russian bank and it is now under pressure to scrutinise a potential takeover of the container shipping firm Hapag-Lloyd by Singapore's Temasek fund. There are fears the Russians could buy into Deutsche Bahn when the state-owned railway floats 24.9% of its services and logistics unit or into grids and power stations being sold by E.ON and RWE.</p> <p>Glos said the law foresaw a \"very restrained examination\" of investments by entities outside the 31 EU and EFTA countries and did not require prior approval for their investments. Germany will be able to call in such investments for three months after a contract is signed and has then two months to decide whether to veto it as \"a threat to public order or security\".</p> <p>Executives in the financial and manufacturing sectors voiced concerns over the impact overseas. Manfred Weber, head of the German Banking Association (BdB), said: \"We must not squander away the indisputable benefits of the free flow of capital.\" J\u00fcrgen Thuman, head of the main industry lobby, the BDI, said: \"Two million German jobs depend on [foreign investors]. We want more, not less, investment.\" The law also faces critical scrutiny from Charlie McCreevy, the EU internal market commissioner.</p>",
  "<p>Licence to Kill was Timothy Dalton's second outing as 007. In the film, Bond resigns from the British Secret Service and sets off on a brutal personal vendetta against a master criminal. The 1989 film was initially called Licence Revoked, but this was changed after test screenings revealed that US crowds associated the term with driving. Joe Wright's Pride and Prejudice got a completely different ending in America, including a final kissing scene that was deemed too sentimental for British audiences. </p> <p>Never underestimate the power of crowds when it comes to the movies. In the final reckoning, it's not the producers, the moneymen, or the stars who call the shots: the reactions of audiences at early test screenings can lead to lines being dropped, scenes being scrapped, even entire plots being rewritten. But where do these screenings take place? How can the musings of a few individuals overrule the will of directors and producers? Just who are these people? And how do you become one?</p> <p>In fact, there are two types of advance screenings: testers and talkers. They are vastly different, but share one common element - audience feedback. Both allow cinemagoers to voice their views, although the former have the greater effect. Tester screenings act as a dry run for studios to check that their film presses all the right buttons - or not. The target demographic is shown a draft of the movie and distributors then judge whether to make changes. This tactic is well-known in Hollywood; what few people appreciate is that British releases are also tested on home ground.</p> <p>Working Title's Atonement, for example, was test-screened, with positive results. It might seem a tough one to test due to its literary theme and poignant ending. Not so. The public were pre-conditioned to favour it, says David Livingstone, president of marketing at Working Title, because \"they had already warmed up to Keira Knightley and Joe Wright with Pride and Prejudice\". Although Atonement was shown to large test audiences, Pride was seen only by executives, families and friends before they decided to axe the ending. So out went the two minutes of Lizzy-Darcy action and in came Donald Sutherland, playing her father, instead. Livingstone also highlights the dual impact of test screenings: their results affect not only the content of the movie, but also how it is marketed. </p> <p>The thriving website Ain't It Cool News receives and airs verdicts from people who have been to test screenings. These can give rise to a lot of headline-grabbing claims that later prove to have little substance. Recently, there was a rumour that shocked reactions to shots of a body-bagged Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight caused the studio to consider removing them completely. Is there any substance to this? Christopher Nolan's agent says he doesn't test his films - so that would be a no.</p> <p>And testing is a risk. You have to keep your nerve, especially if you're not willing to make any changes, whatever anyone says. Negative reaction to Se7en was ignored, leaving David Fincher's dark masterpiece intact. On the other hand, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle went completely unscreened, leading to disaster, at least as far as most critics were concerned. </p> <p>Given today's increasingly interactive industry, how easy is it to take part in a test screening? The answer seems to be a matter of luck. The process of selection is managed by NRG (National Research Group), the secretive market research company that operates on both sides of the Atlantic. It divides the market into four basic groups, known as \"quadrants\": males under 25, males over 25, females under 25, and females over 25. (In some cases, the respondents are also divided by race.) From its survey results, NRG projects how well upcoming movies will do against each other in each quadrant, should they open on the same weekend.</p> <p>Testers, says Livingstone, aim for a core audience with a bit of variety, holding screenings in such places as Fulham and Kensington in London, to High Wycombe and Reading. There, they approach unsuspecting members of the public with clipboards. \"Have you seen a film directed by so-and-so?\" they ask, singling you out as their ideal test subject. Ten minutes later, free ticket in hand, you can waltz along to a local cinema and then fill in your answers with a brand new pencil. Industry infiltrated.</p> <p>For those who live further afield, there's the talker screening. A more indirect form of feedback, its purpose is to promote films to the public, to get the word out. Sign up with an agency or newspaper and you can see a film up to a couple of weeks before its release. It's the finished product - you won't prompt any re-cuts - but the studios want responses for future campaigns. It's no coincidence that, at both testers and talkers, the top two boxes on the form, rating the film as \"excellent\" or \"very good\", are directly followed by the all-important question: \"Would you recommend this film to a friend?\"</p> <p>One company that manages talker screenings is SeeFilmFirst (<a href=\"http://www.seefilmfirst.com\">seefilmfirst.com</a>). As well as creating publicity via word-of-mouth, it also records your opinion. As one researcher says: \"Everyone loves a free ticket and in return we ask people to fill in an online feedback form.\" Whether you're selected for a talker or not will depend on your profile, as a brief questionnaire online determines your type, or types, of movie. If the targeting is off-target, the responses can be damaging. So be quite clear about what genres you love and loathe or you might be responsible for a new - and completely bizarre - cut of Blade Runner.</p> <p>So remember: clipboards have clout; they are now as essential to film-making as clapperboards. Watch out for the people carrying them. They might just give you the chance to change movie history.</p>",
  "<p>Maybe it has something to do with the credit crunch but shares in Kent and <br>Lancashire have been plummeting faster than house prices in recent weeks. They have lost matches and the plot as well, with Lancashire's captain, Stuart Law, firing a broadside at his own club over the decision to release Dominic Cork and Robert Key, his opposite number at Kent, describing his side's batting - including his own - as \"brainless.\"</p> <p>Kent have lost two one-day cup finals and slipped from being championship contenders to one place above the relegation zone. The Lancashire players, meanwhile, appear giddy with delight to be away from Old Trafford, where they have been outplayed by Hampshire, Sussex and Yorkshire in their last three matches only to escape with draws.</p> <p>So both teams entered this game with much to prove and, with the table misshapen by bad weather and wall-to-wall Twenty20 in June, still with an outside chance of winning the championship. Kent won the toss and chose to bat but had to be pulled from the mire by Geraint Jones, who made his best score of the season. They were doing well enough at 41 for nought. But they went to lunch on 61 for three. Key was run out when Joe Denly's drive was deflected onto the stumps by the bowler, Sajid Mahmood. Denly was caught in the gully before Martin van Jaarsveld was adjudged lbw.</p> <p>Lancashire, who have brought back Mal Loye and Mark Chilton for their overseas player Lou Vincent and the retired Iain Sutcliffe, almost br oke through in the first over after lunch when Loye nearly caught Neil Dexter, on 12, off Mahmood. Dexter made another 26 before being snared in the same position.</p> <p>Kent were 105 for five when Darren Stevens was caught by Gary Keedy but Jones, first with Ryan McLaren and then James Tredwell, brought up the 200.</p>",
  "<p>The world has generally moved on a bit from the King Herod approach to threat prevention. Just how far our own part of the world has moved is evident from the security service briefing note on radicalisation on which we report today. The note, which was written by MI5's behavioural science unit, reveals a generally thoughtful and emotionally mature approach to the complex causes and textures of violent political extremism in the United Kingdom today. </p> <p>The very existence of such a unit as this - though the FBI has had one for 20 years - is a reminder that much has changed in the national security field since the days when MI5 was staffed by muscular public-school academic underachievers or when the special branch could warn judges that people from Islington were not to be trusted. The note itself, meanwhile, offers both a dispassionate and troubling analysis, at the heart of which is the recognition that there are no simple answers or easy levers to pull in combating the current surge of violent extremism in this country.</p> <p>The document is useful official recognition that many of the stereotypical assumptions about the people who become terrorists in Britain today are liable to be myths. For a start, the majority of radical terrorists are British nationals, not foreigners, and most of those who are foreign are here legally. They are also ethnically diverse (as the UK Muslim population also is), including individuals from many ethnic backgrounds, including Caucasians. It is refreshing to read in a classified government document on such a highly charged subject that \"We cannot make assumptions about involvement in terrorism based on the colour of someone's skin, their ethnic heritage or their nationality.\" It is important that those words are passed right down the command chain in many of our services.</p> <p>Terrorists are mainly male but not always young; some become involved when already past 30. Nor are they the loners of mythology; most are in steady relationships and many have children. Some are poorly educated but others are extremely well-qualified; it is, however, common to find them in low-paid jobs, often lower-paid than their qualifications might lead them to expect. Frustrated expectations, not excluding a sense of being discriminated against, seem to be common features. Neither a criminal background nor devout religious belief are as widespread as many suppose. Terrorists, in short, tend to reflect the communities in which they live.</p> <p>Yet - crucially - it does not follow that everyone in those communities is a potential terrorist. Though there is no single pathway into terrorism, there are some common factors. MI5 highlights four areas of vulnerability - the experience of migration, the failure to achieve, involvement in crime, and significant periods of overseas travel - which in particular circumstances and combinations can precipitate a person towards the apparent rewards to be found in the terrorist culture.</p> <p>Nothing in the MI5 briefing note offers easy answers for the service's agents as they try to spot the actual or potential suicide bomber in our midst. Inevitably any shift of emphasis away from often fruitless profiling and modelling implies an unstated move towards longterm infiltration and accumulation of data. So liberals who find the briefing note reassuringly sensible and restrained are likely to find the other side of the MI5 coin - the implied importance of surveillance and data accumulation - much less comfortable. Yet the MI5 note is again realistic when it highlights the importance of social measures - job opportunities and equality laws matter at least as much as tougher anti-terrorism bills. MI5 is right too to highlight the importance of politicians and the media. If they - we - had played a less provocative role on many occasions in the past then MI5's job would not be as difficult as it now is.</p>",
  "<p>The war in Afghanistan is running out of control. The multiple attacks mounted by Taliban guerrillas on Nato occupation troops on Monday and Tuesday - in which 10 newly arrived French soldiers were killed near Kabul and a US base hit by suicide bombers - are the most daring since the US-led invasion of 2001. More than 100 people have been killed in fighting in the past three days, as the war against foreign occupation has spread from the south to the east and the area around the capital.</p> <p>The assault on the French reinforcements follows the killing of nine US soldiers in a single attack last month, and the freeing of hundreds of Taliban prisoners from Kandahar's main jail in a night-time raid in June. As Afghanistan experiences its own Iraq-style surge of US and other Nato forces, the death toll is rising inexorably. The number of occupation troops killed in Afghanistan overtook the Iraqi level in May. Attacks on US-led forces are up by 50% on last year, Nato air attacks have increased 40%, and more than 2,500 have already reportedly lost their lives in the conflict since January - getting on for half of them civilians.</p> <p>In a damning indictment of the impact of Nato's occupation on Afghanistan, aid agencies reported earlier this month that insecurity was spreading to previously stable areas and the killing of civilians by all sides rising sharply. The US air force seems to have developed a particular habit of attacking wedding parties - last month 47 civilians were killed in one strike - while British troops, who lost 13 soldiers in June alone, killed a woman and two children last weekend, which the high command naturally blamed on the Taliban.</p> <p>This is the conflict western politicians have convinced themselves is the \"good war\", in contrast to the shame of Iraq. Britain's defence secretary, Des Browne, recently declared it \"the noble cause of the 21st century\". Nicolas Sarkozy, who faces a similar level of domestic opposition to the Afghan imbroglio as in Britain, insists that France is fighting for \"democracy and freedom\". Barack Obama calls it the \"central front\" in the war on terror and, like Gordon Brown, is committed to transferring troops from Iraq to Afghanistan to bolster the fight.</p> <p>That will certainly jack up the killing and suffering still further. As Zbigniew Brzezinski - the former US national security adviser who masterminded the early stages of the mujahideen war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan - argues, putting more troops in is not the solution: \"We run the risk that our military presence will gradually turn the Afghan population entirely against us.\"</p> <p>The original aims of the invasion, it will be recalled, were the capture or killing of Osama bin Laden and the Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, and the destruction of al-Qaida in the aftermath of 9/11. None of those aims has been achieved. Instead, the US and its friends brought back to power an alliance of brutal and corrupt warlords, gave them new identities as democrats with phoney elections, and drove the Taliban and al-Qaida leaderships over the border into Pakistan. </p> <p>Far from reducing the threat of terrorism, this crucible of the war on terror has simply spread it around the region, bringing forth an increasingly potent campaign of resistance and giving a new lease of life to a revamped Taliban as a champion of Pashtun nationalism. And as mission creep has detached the Afghan war from its original declared target of al-Qaida - let alone the claims made about women's rights, which have been going into grim reverse again in much of the country under Nato tutelage - it has morphed into the kind of war of \"civilisation\" evoked by Sarkozy and Browne, a certain recipe for conflict without end. No wonder British politicians have talked about digging in for decades.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the long-term cost of the west's shameless support for Pakistan's military dictatorship as the linchpin of its war on terror, while forever preaching democracy, became clearer this week. General Musharraf's welcome departure has left the country in political crisis and exposed the contradictions at the heart of the US relationship with the nuclear-armed state. </p> <p>Even while the Pakistani military has relied on the US alliance to underpin its strategic position with India, its intelligence arm, the ISI, has maintained links with the Taliban as a long-term regional investment - at the same time as the Pakistan army has fought the local Taliban under American pressure. Now the threat of full-scale US incursions against Taliban sanctuaries in Pakistan's border areas risks profoundly destabilising one of the most combustible states in the world.</p> <p>Afghanistan was supposed to be a demonstration of Nato's expanded horizons in the post-Soviet new world order. Instead, as with Nato's disastrous engagement with Georgia, it has underscored the dangers of giving the cold war alliance a new imperial brief. The growing conflict must also be added to the litany of US foreign policy failures that have been overseen by George Bush - from Iraq, Iran, Palestine and Lebanon to Latin America and now the Caucasus - and the evident necessity of a new direction.</p> <p>That is likely to be a mountain to climb, even under an Obama presidency. The Afghan war certainly cannot be won, but the bitterly unpopular 2005 agreement for indefinite bases in the country left no doubt that the US is planning to stay for the long haul. Nato's secretary general, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, made clear in a speech to the Brookings Institution in Washington earlier this year that western interests in Afghanistan went well beyond good governance to the strategic interest in having a permanent military presence in a state that borders central Asia, China, Iran and Pakistan.</p> <p>The only way to end the war is the withdrawal of foreign troops as part of a political settlement negotiated with all the significant players in the country, including the Taliban, and guaranteed by the regional powers and neighbouring states. A large majority of Afghans say they back negotiations with the Taliban, even in western-conducted opinion polls. The Taliban themselves insist they will only talk once foreign troops have withdrawn. If that were the only obstacle, it could surely be choreographed as a parallel process. But given the scale of commitments made by the US and Nato, the fire of the Afghan war seems bound to spread further.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.milne@theguardian.com\">s.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Usain Bolt fulfilled the dream of his youth in awesome fashion at the Bird's Nest here last night when he won the Olympic 200 metres final in 19.30sec, breaking the 12-year old record set by Michael Johnson at the Atlanta Games. </p> <p>It completed the greatest double in athletics history as the Jamaican became the first runner to break the 100m and 200m world records at the same Olympics and the first to win the Olympic sprint double since Carl Lewis in Los Angeles in 1984. </p> <p>Since winning the world junior 200m title in Kingston in 2002 at the age of 15, Bolt, who turns 22 today and was treated to a rendition of Happy Birthday over the public address system here, had set his heart on becoming Olympic champion at the distance. \"It was always my dream,\" he said. \"I just blew my mind and blew the world's mind. I can't explain how I feel. I just proved to the world that I am a true champion and that with hard work, anything is possible.\"</p> <p>The watching Johnson, whose mark was 19.32, dubbed Bolt \"Superman 2\" - to which the Jamaican replied: \"I ain't no Superman 2. I am the Lightning Bolt.\"</p> <p>After his 9.69 in Saturday's 100m final when he showboated over the line, last night Bolt treated the crowd to what they had been hoping for - a demonstration of what he could do with an all-out effort. Having cruised through the 200m heats he was in full stride almost from the gun in the final and left the field trailing. \"It's brutal,\" said the former 100m world champion Kim Collins, who finished sixth. \"It's a brutal ass-whipping we took.\"</p> <p>Britain's Christian Malcolm, who was fifth, said: \"People were shocked when Michael Johnson did what he did in Atlanta. People will be more shocked by what Usain Bolt has done in these championships. He is a good guy and it can only help the sport.\"</p> <p>A dark cloud had been cast over athletics because of the drugs shame of Bolt's predecessors but Herb Elliott, the Jamaican team doctor and a member of the IAAF anti-doping commission, said: \"I know he is clean. We know where he lives, his coach is always there, we know what he does, we know what he eats.\"</p> <p>Churandy Martina, of the Netherlands Antilles, finished second and the American Wallace Spearmon third - but they were then disqualified for running out of lane, promoting the American defending champion Shawn Crawford and his compatriot Walter Dix to silver and bronze.</p>",
  "<p>If there is a god of sport - and at this stage in the British medal procession who can seriously doubt that there is? - then please let him have me wake up tomorrow morning as the owner of a bicycle shop.</p> <p>High-grade carbon-fibre frame? Sorry sir, we are sold out. Aerodynamic bodysuit? Alas, someone came in five minutes ago and bought the last dozen. The talent, dedication and competitive will of Victoria Pendleton? Madam, there are some things money can't buy.</p> <p>The point is that we are all cyclists now, or at least we will be until we get a puncture 15 miles from home only to discover we forgot to pack a spare inner tube, or until the nights start drawing in, or until Sunday afternoons parked in front of the telly watching another dreary Premier League match become a more attractive proposition than Sunday afternoons peddling on the A956 as mud is sprayed in your face by a passing SUV.</p> <p>The garages and garden sheds of Britain are the graveyard of sporting fads, with abandoned golf clubs piled on rusting bikes and tennis rackets entangled in the laces of trainers bought in the first flush of marathon mania. Such is the fate of modern mass enthusiasm. There is no shame - only a financial penalty - attached to having believed that sporting stardom was only a \u00a3300 impulse buy away. Bruce Springsteen might argue otherwise, but some people really weren't born to run. Or play golf. Or tennis. Or cycle.</p> <p>Let those unlucky people follow their passions elsewhere, to the library or the nearest multiplex cinema. We wish them well and hope they will forgive us if, in these days of Olympic euphoria, we concentrate our thoughts on those whose interest in sport has been roused by the magnificent performances of British athletes in Beijing.</p> <p>How do we encourage this interest, harness it and transform it into a permanent feature of our national life? This, as you might fashionably ask, is the 16-gold medal question.</p> <p>Needless to say there are as many answers as there political hacks and slick-haired PR types wandering around Beijing at the taxpayers' expense, claiming credit for the achievements of others. It would require a unique gullibility to be taken in by such people, especially when we have access to the wisdom of those athletes who have created the current euphoria.</p> <p>How do we encourage cycling in this country in the hope that we produce the next Chris Hoy? Easy, we don't close the Edinburgh council velodrome where the next Chris Hoy might develop his talent. \"I wouldn't be standing here with any medals round my neck if the Meadowbank velodrome hadn't existed,\" the Scotsman said after picking up his third gold of the Games. \"Why not built more facilities rather than knocking them down? It's about getting kids on bikes and into sport.\"</p> <p>That is but one example of the accountancy-driven myopia that might yet stifle hopes of capitalising on British success in Beijing, but it is by no means the most glaring. No, that distinction belongs to our own government, which refuses to guarantee an additional \u00a3100m in athletes' funding in the lead-up to London 2012.</p> <p>In the latest get-me-through-the-next-press-conference announcement, the culture minister Andy Burnham unveiled a scheme yesterday called Medal Hopes in which the private sector is to be encouraged to come up with the \u00a3100m. Fair enough, you might think, until you read on to discover the government has spent the past two years encouraging the private sector to come up with \u00a3100m, an effort that has failed to raise a penny. Nor is it likely to, given the current economic climate and competition for sponsorship money as 2012 approaches. To suggest otherwise, as Burnham did yesterday, is to strain credulity to the limit. To then insist, as he did, that the government is committed to having the \"strongest team in London\" beggars belief.</p> <p>There is only one way the government can show its commitment to British athletes and a strong British team in 2012 and that is by guaranteeing the \u00a3100m. They should do so before Sunday's closing ceremony in Beijing - for the next Chris Hoy, and for bike shop owners up and down the land.</p> <p><strong>Beijing embraces Olympic spirit, but not the foreign spectators that come with it</strong></p> <p>The walk to the National Stadium is a wonderful experience, especially at night, when the warm breeze caresses the skin, spectators are excitedly making their way to their seats clutching precious tickets and the buildings dotted about the Olympic Park - most notably the stadium itself and the \"Water Cube\" (aka the National Aquatic Centre) - light up the sky like visiting spaceships.</p> <p>China is proud of the 2008 Games and rightly so. They have been superbly organised, the volunteers have shown, ahem, Olympian politeness and many of the events have been breathtaking, not least in the athletics stadium.</p> <p>Yet, if I can bastardise a phrase patented by the former IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, these are not \"the best Games ever\" for the simple reason they have been staged for the greater glory of China and not for the greater good of sport.</p> <p>Look around on that walk towards the National Stadium and you will see very few foreign visitors, apart from the occasional group of sponsors' guests being led to their seats by a guide, or a gaggle of English ticket touts trying to rip off the locals. The best Olympics have been those that have embraced internationalism, but the Chinese government's suspicion of foreigners has meant the rest of the world has largely been excluded. This is a pity for the Games but most especially for the hosts, who have denied themselves the chance to show the world what a fascinating country this is.</p> <p><strong>You're free to protest but...</strong></p> <p>There will be a lot of talk in the coming days about how the 2008 Games have advanced freedoms in China. Believe none of it.</p> <p>There are people better placed than me to give chapter and verse on the indignities of living in a totalitarian state, although it might serve a useful purpose to draw your attention to a report by the official government news agency that said the Beijing authorities had received 77 requests to demonstrate since August 1.</p> <p>\"Seventy-four applications have been withdrawn so far, because the problems those applicants contended for were properly addressed by relevant authorities or departments through consultations,\" the news agency explained. \"Two other applications have been suspended because their procedures were incomplete. In one of such cases, for example, the applicant applied to take children to the demonstration, which is against China's law, and the one remaining application has been vetoed by the public security authority, as it is in violation of China's law on demonstrations and protests.\"</p> <p><strong>Gold-medal sportsmanship</strong></p> <p>The Australian swimmer Grant Hackett returned home with the silver medal he won in the men's 1500m. Less impressively, he also went as my favourite athlete of these Games.</p> <p>Hackett, who was going for his third successive gold in the event, was denied victory by Oussama Mellouli - a Tunisian swimmer who was only in Beijing courtesy of a controversial decision to cut his two-year ban for a doping offence to 18 months.</p> <p>Many Australians were incensed but not Hackett, who was offered multiple opportunities to criticise the gold medallist. \"His past is his past. You know, he was a better competitor on the blocks,\" he said. \"There's no bitterness at all, it is the way it is and that's life.\"</p>",

  "<p>While I sympathise with the plight of struggling homeowners and those facing eviction due to mortgage problems (Repossession: this will scar the children for life, August 16), I would like to plant a reminder about the sad realities of those who rely on private landlords to provide a roof over their heads. </p> <p>Tenancy laws in this country mean that families and individuals can be forced to leave their homes at comparatively short notice; I myself have been evicted four times in the past six years - landlord decides to sell/renovate/relocate. Those of us who hold down reasonable jobs, but are not fortunate enough to inherit property from our parents, are effectively priced out of the housing market and thus forced to live miserable, insecure lives, existing at the whim of private landlords. Whenever there is panic in the housing market, one hears commentators express bemusement that more professional people with middle incomes in the UK do not rent in the private sector, as is common on the continent. Rented property in this country is overpriced, hard to find, expensive to run and insecure. I'm sorry that owner-occupiers are struggling, but - welcome to my world!<br><strong>Gill Ogden</strong><br>Aberystwyth </p> <p>Here we go again, yet more articles featuring the \"squeeze\" or \"plight\" of modern buy-to-let landlords - plus of course the inevitable comments about the collapsing resale price of that mythical \"industry staple\" - the city-centre two-bed apartment (Report, August 19). This has never been the \"industry staple\" - far from it. Two-bedroom units are often a de facto problem that's been foisted on the unwary (inexperienced) investor by a collaboration of pushy letting agents, ambitious developers and over-eager lenders, all anxious to guarantee their own respective bottom lines. </p> <p>In fact, the \"industry staple\" rental is, was and will probably remain a one-bedroom unit. Tenants don't waste cash on space they don't need and rarely aspire to a spare room. Meaning that, with two or more tenants to make the extra space pay its way, inexperienced landlords are in fact creating houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) - newly and vigorously policed with legislation that has real teeth under the 2006 Housing Act. </p> <p>As for the collapse of \"interest-only 100%-plus funding\" for investments of this type with such long investment tails, well I could make a damned good case against any financial adviser who'd encouraged me to fund BTL on some fairly promiscuous borrowings based on the myth of permanent property price hikes. The HBOS chair had it right. Basically, landlords with their ducks in a row will survive and prosper in climates of all types. The others are sitting ducks. But please, no more talk of \"plights\" - a \"plight\" is having to queue for a bag of rice, not failing to become filthy rich.<br><strong>Lesley Henderson</strong><br>Author, The Landlord's Survival Guide</p>",
  "<p>Labour MP Ann Cryer announced last night that she would step down from parliament at the next general election. She was elected MP for Keighley in 1997 and has campaigned on issues including forced marriage, domestic violence and honour killings. Cryer was a driving force behind a law enabling courts to intervene in cases of forced marriages which comes into effect next month. The 68-year-old told Labour party members she had decided to stand down \"mainly concerning my age, health and decreasing energy\". Cryer became an MP after the death of her politician husband Bob.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's manufacturers highlighted the acute policy dilemma facing the Bank of England yesterday when they reported the gloomiest outlook for factory output in seven years combined with intense pressure to raise prices.</p> <p>The monthly health check of industry from the CBI, the employers' organisation, showed order books weak, stocks of unsold goods rising, deep production cuts looming and costs rising. Separate data from the Council for Mortgage Lenders (CML) showed demand for home loans down 27% in the year to July, although there was a 5% pick-up from June to July.</p> <p>Ian McCafferty, the CBI's chief economic adviser, said: \"Manufacturers are becoming more downbeat about forthcoming levels of activity but are still having to raise their prices due to the severity of recent cost increases. Domestic conditions remain sluggish and the recent slowdown in the eurozone economies is starting to make conditions tougher for UK manufacturing exporters, although the weaker pound will offer some relief.\"</p> <p>The CBI report - the weakest since the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks - coincided with the release of the minutes of the meeting of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee this month.</p> <p>Faced with the prospect of inflation rising to 5% in the coming months and economic growth coming to a standstill, seven members of the MPC voted to leave borrowing costs on hold, rejecting calls from Tim Besley for a quarter-point increase in interest rates and from David Blanchflower for a cut of a similar size. Besley said the risks of inflation taking root were strong enough to warrant the first rate rise in more than a year; Blanchflower said there was a risk that a rapid slowdown would drag inflation below its target of 2%.</p> <p>According to the minutes, the MPC decided that the main risk from tightening policy \"would be that an unexpected rate rise might adversely affect business and consumer confidence, adding to the near-term downside pressures on activity and causing a material undershoot of the inflation target in the medium term. Although rates could be cut later in that event, the downturn would be unnecessarily deep, adding to the volatility in the economy.\" </p> <p>A report on business conditions from the Bank's regional agents, also released yesterday, said that over the past month consumer spending had eased further, the housing slowdown had continued, investment was being mothballed and the labour market was weakening.</p> <p>The committee said that a cut in bank rate may help \"ameliorate the worst of the downturn in activity\" and lessen the risk of undershooting the inflation target. But the MPC was worried about sending the signal that the Bank had gone soft on inflation. </p> <p>\"The main risk associated with an immediate cut was that it could cause wage and price setters to conclude that the committee was more concerned about sustaining output growth than about returning inflation to its target.\"</p> <p>If that happened, the minutes said, there would be a risk of inflation rising still further, requiring increases in interest rates that would have an even bigger impact on growth.</p> <p>The MPC decided that leaving rates unchanged was the least bad option. \"Given the current stance of monetary policy and the prospective weakness in the economy, the resulting increase in spare capacity should bear down on inflation. That would help to counter the risk of high inflation in the near term becoming embedded in inflation expectations, and to bring inflation back to the target. There would, however, still be significant risks to the inflation outlook.\"</p> <p>Fresh evidence of the health of the economy will emerge today, when figures for retail sales in July are released. After a big jump in high-street spending in May and an equally big fall in June, the City is waiting to see how consumers respond to lower house prices and the squeeze on real incomes from higher inflation.</p>",
  "<p>It has taken more than two decades of operations as a private company and two years of detailed investigation, but the Competition Commission has finally concurred with what the vast majority of domestic airlines and millions of air passengers have known for years: BAA's monopoly of the UK's big airports is a very bad idea that has turned flying into a form of torture. </p> <p>Once, the firm that attracted the most widespread vilification and opprobrium among consumers was Railtrack. Now, without doubt, it is BAA - at least for the 90% of air travellers in the south- east and 84% in Scotland who have little choice but to use its grotty, overcrowded airports if they want to fly.</p> <p>The commission's report has pointed the finger at BAA for failing to lobby effectively for expansion. Three of its seven airports - probably Gatwick and Stansted, and Glasgow or Edinburgh - will now have to be sold. But at least for several years to come, and for whoever eventually buys the three airports, the watchdog's findings are unlikely to ease the pain of airline passengers.</p> <p>It could be quite simple and quick to address some of the things that really matter to passengers, such as the interminable queues for check-in and security, the squalid lavatories, the rip-off car parks, gaudy in-your-face shopping malls and departure gates where passengers must sit on the floor.</p> <p>Big improvements would be possible to all of the above with more resources and different priorities. But the chances of BAA caring about such little things now are almost zero. So we must hope for long-term change instead. The commission acknowledges that it is capacity that is the major factor preventing better service for airlines and passengers. The earliest possible date for a new London runway is 2015 for Stansted. A third runway at Heathrow would not happen for at least 12 years. </p> <p>The commission reckons a new owner or two might make a rather better fist of what is already available. But that depends on who buys the airports. In a bid to keep out opportunistic investment bank bidders, any buyer will have to have both financial clout and airport management experience.</p> <p>But that won't mean Goldman Sachs can't sign up a few airport professionals and slap an offer on the table. There will likely be sovereign wealth funds keen to own a trophy asset such as Heathrow and there are certainly infrastructure funds with cash to invest, although the airport owner Macquarie is currently selling rather than buying to cut debt. But the environment has changed markedly in the last year. Aside from tighter credit conditions, there is a more uncertain outlook for the aviation sector and there are likely to be changes to regulation. </p> <p>In any case, why does the commission think a new debt-funded corporate owner will necessarily be any better than BAA? Many of the best overseas airports against which the London airports compare so unfavourably are state-owned. A new corporate owner will still want to make the best return possible for its shareholders.</p> <p>And the last time the commission demanded the wholesale sell-off of assets to other operators was the Beer Orders, nearly 20 years ago. They backfired almost completely when the giant breweries, judged over-powerful, were merely replaced by giant pub groups.</p> <p>The real issue for BAA, as the government's 2003 white paper showed, is that airports and aviation are fast becoming a public policy issue of the highest priority. According to the business lobby, a third runway at Heathrow is the top priority, but the government should not automatically buy that argument just because Sir Nigel Rudd and his CBI chums are banging on about it. They argue that if Heathrow can't expand then Schiphol or Frankfurt will step up and steal our flights.</p> <p>Well maybe. Or perhaps views other than the impact on big business are now more important. The environmental damage caused by air travel is a far bigger issue than it was when the third runway debate first started. And the price of oil has changed the economics of aviation. It is not a given that London wants another runway and the pollution that goes with it when a third of those arriving at Heathrow are transit passengers who do not contribute to the UK economy.</p> <p>Arguably airports, like railways, are a vital part of the country's infrastructure. And perhaps, in the same way as Railtrack was reinvented as Network Rail, the airport infrastructure should be operated by a not-for-dividend organisation.</p> <p>For Ferrovial, the Spanish group that acquired BAA two years ago, it is not a happy outcome. They paid a top dollar enterprise value of \u00a319bn for BAA and are now likely to have to accept fire-sale prices for three airports. </p> <p>However, they did plough ahead with the bid even after the OFT's initial competition investigation was announced, so it is not as though they did not know what might hit them.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:julia.finch@theguardian.com\">julia.finch@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The schools minister Lord Adonis has told the Guardian that the 20% of pupils who leave primary school lacking basic skills in reading, writing and mathematics is the biggest failure of the Labour government's education policies. </p> <p>Adonis - who today oversees the publication of GCSE results for the first generation of schoolchildren solely educated under the Labour government - admitted more reform was needed to make sure all pupils mastered the 3Rs early. </p> <p>Today's 16-year-olds started compulsory schooling aged five in 1997 as Labour came to power promising to put education at the heart of their social reform. In a frank assessment of Labour's record, Adonis said the fact that a minority of parents still face a \"postcode lottery\" over whether their child had a good local secondary to attend, 11 years after Labour came to power, was \"unacceptable\".</p> <p>But he said the period since 1997 had seen the most significant improvements in education in British history. \"Over the last 11 years since this generation of students started at school there has been a transformation in the funding and support for schools and in the attainment that flows from that,\" he said. </p> <p>Since 1997 investment in education had doubled, there were 40,000 more teachers and better exam results, he said, praising teachers for the 10-percentage-point increase in pupils reaching the target of five A*-to-C GCSEs. </p> <p>But asked where progress had been lacking, he said: \"We still have what I term the stubborn 20% who aren't reaching the standards we expect in literacy and numeracy by the age of 11. </p> <p>\"That figure was nearly twice as large 10 years ago so we have narrowed that proportion significantly. But to my mind our biggest challenge over the next few years is to see that all primary school children, as early as possible within their primary school years, get up to standard in the basics of literacy and numeracy.\"</p> <p>Sats results for 11-year-olds earlier this month suggested progress has stalled, with a drop in the number of pupils achieving the highest level for their age and new concerns about writing skills. The results for 14-year-olds showed a different problem, with reading skills dropping behind as children got older. </p> <p>Today's GCSEs results are expected to show another rise in the proportion of top grades awarded to pupils, with the percentage of A* and A grades edging towards 20% - but around half of 16-year-olds will fail to achieve the government's target of five good GCSEs including English and maths.</p> <p>Adonis defended the national tests for 11- and 14-year-olds, which he insisted were crucial to expose the areas where skills were lacking. But he reiterated promises made by the schools secretary, Ed Balls, about reforming the system, which was widely unpopular in schools even before this year's marking process collapsed. </p> <p>That failure led to ETS, the American company brought in to run Sats marking, losing its \u00a3156m contract. Adonis said the design of Sats was \"under review\". </p> <p>\"There is room for debate on the precise form the tests take but I believe it would be a seriously retrograde step to abandon national tests,\" he added.</p> <p>Adonis, who was a Liberal Democrat councillor before joining the Labour party in the 1990s, being made a peer and then schools minister, said a second government priority after literacy and numeracy would be to eliminate failing schools. </p> <p>\"I think also I would herald as a key objective the elimination of underperforming secondary schools,\" he said. \"The key objective of improvement must be to get primary school children up to competence in the basics, but it is not acceptable that parents should be faced without a choice of a good quality secondary school in their locality.\"</p> <p>Today's GCSE results will help decide the fate of the 638 schools which are currently missing the government's target of at least 30% of pupils getting five good GCSEs including English and maths. Those which haven't shown significant improvements will take a step towards being turned into an academy or closed. Adonis said this would help to further drive up standards and end the \"postcode lottery\" some families face. </p> <p>Separately today, the right-of-centre thinktank Civitas publishes a report alleging that much of the improvement in official figures on education has been fuelled by a rise in schools in disadvantaged areas opting to do non-traditional qualifications. </p> <p>It argues that instead of high-quality vocational qualifications being offered as an alternative to GCSEs, many are offered to \"occupy\" or \"babysit\" weaker pupils who would otherwise jeopardise A*-C GCSE targets. The report says: \"Essentially they are 'filler' courses before pupils can go on to genuine vocational education.\"</p> <p>Anastasia de Waal, head of education at Civitas, said: \"Too many people are being cheated in this government stunt: pupils, employers, the public, and all to make the government look like it's doing better than it is.\"</p> <h2>Case study: Lessons</h2> <p>Sixteen-year-old Michael Alldis, who went to St Columba's school, in Bexleyheath, Kent, thinks his lessons were not up to standard. \"We had a lot of supply teachers coming in so I didn't think the lessons were very good really.\" To succeed, it's the teacher that counts, he says. \"We had all the technology - whiteboards, projectors and stuff like that - but they don't actually help you with maths. We had literacy and numeracy hour at primary school, so we did basic comprehension, maths, algebra. They separated the groups according to ability. I know [of] the gifted and talented scheme, there were special maths lessons in the holidays and visits to Oxford and Cambridge universities. I have an older brother, who's now 20, and we both agreed our experience of primary school was better than secondary. He also went to St Columba's and he had better teachers, ones I call 'old school' because they knew how to control the class. It all comes down to the teachers.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Tuesday August 26 2008.

  "<p>An extraordinary picture of a state body carrying out political lobbying on the issue of free data has emerged from documents obtained by the Guardian.</p> <p>The correspondence reveals that Ordnance Survey (OS) is targeting MPs from Westminster and devolved assemblies, civil servants and leading figures in the free data debate. The agency openly attends party conferences and other political events to promote the value of geographical data. However, earlier this year a Parliamentary question revealed that it had paid a company called Mandate \u00a342,076.20 plus VAT since August 2007. </p> <p>Ordnance Survey said: \"Mandate Communications provides Ordnance Survey with strategic communications advice.\" Mandate is a well-known political lobbyist.

However, it refused to release emails on backup tapes on the grounds of cost, \u00a311,250. The correspondence released - mainly between Nicole Perry, head of public affairs, and Mandate executives whose names have been blanked out - reveals a busy programme of meetings with politicians, especially those who have asked questions in Parliament about OS's corporate affairs, or about free data. </p> <p>Among MPs named are Labour's David Taylor - \"you might recall that he'd (sic) raised the issue of free data\" - Conservatives Anne McIntosh and Paul Beresford, and several Welsh Assembly members.

  "<p>An Iranian actor has been barred from leaving Iran after closely guarded details emerged of her starring role with Leonardo DiCaprio in a forthcoming Hollywood spy thriller about a hunt for an al-Qaida leader. </p> <p>Golshifteh Farahani was told by officials that she was not allowed to travel when she tried to board a flight at Tehran's Imam Khomeini airport. She is believed to have been bound for the US to discuss future film roles. Farahani, 25, recently finished filming her Hollywood debut film, Body of Lies, directed by Ridley Scott, which is due to be released by Warner Brothers on October 10.</p> <p>Her role in the thriller had been widely rumoured among Iranian cinema aficionados, but only became common knowledge after the Internet Movie Database website posted the film's cast and official trailer. The trailer includes a shot of Farahani, apparently without hijab, standing behind DiCaprio. Her appearance was reported by the newspaper Etemad.</p> <p>It is unclear who ordered Farahani's travel ban, but Iranian news websites attributed it to the culture and Islamic guidance ministry (Ershad), which oversees all cultural activities. According to some reports, the ministry has issued rules requiring actors to seek its permission before accepting roles abroad.</p> <p>Ershad has a track record of trying to control Iranian film output and has banned the screening of several internationally acclaimed works by some of the country's best-known directors.</p> <p>Calls to Farahani's mobile phone by the Guardian went unanswered yesterday.</p> <p>Farahani, who has been acting since she was six and is the daughter of a prominent actor and theatre director, has long been famous in her native country, having won the best actress award at 14 in the international section of Iran's Fajr film festival for her role in Under the Pear Tree.</p> <p>She appeared in Bahman Ghobadi's Half Moon, which won the golden seashell award at the 2006 San Sebastian film festival, and in M for Mother, which was chosen to represent Iran in the best foreign film section of this year's academy awards.</p> <p>The pre-release publicity for Body of Lies, which also stars Russell Crowe, has not specified her role. She is understood to play Ayesheh, a nurse with whom Roger Ferris, a CIA agent played by DiCaprio, falls in love while pursuing Suleiman, a leading al-Qaida operative, in Jordan.</p> <p>Parts of the screenplay - written by William Monahan and based on a novel by the Washington Post journalist David Ignatius - are said to have been specially adapted for Farahani's character, to avoid infringing Islamic rules on female modesty. The Iranian news website Farda reported that her contract included a clause requiring that all scenes show her with full hijab.</p>",
  "<p>The number of students due to start university in the autumn has hit a new high, with more than 375,000 having won a degree place by yesterday. </p> <p>The 8.4% increase in successful applications compared with the same point last year - a total of 30,000 additional students - may be being fuelled by a renaissance in traditional degree subjects, the university admissions services Ucas suggested. </p> <p>The government seized on the figures, saying they proved that the introduction of tuition fees and then top-up fees had not put students off applying to university - with a 0.9 percentage point increase in the proportion of students applying from the poorest four socioeconomic groups. </p> <p>The National Union of Students (NUS) appealed to the government and universities not to become complacent, saying progress was still painfully slow.</p> <p>The figures also suggested a slight relative fall in the proportion of students coming from the wealthiest homes who are least likely to benefit from government grants. Other than that, and a slight rise among students from semi-manual backgrounds, the proportion of students in England of each socioeconomic group has remained static. </p> <p>The addition of nursing and midwifery students for the first time this year is thought to have had an effect, but it is the first suggestion that fees could be having an impact on students from wealthier backgrounds who do not qualify for grants. </p> <p>The number applying for biology is up by three percentage points, chemistry by five points, physics by four points, mathematics by seven points, and engineering subjects by six points. </p> <p>French and German are also up by four percentage points. Art, music and media all saw small drops. </p> <p>The most popular degree is now law, followed by design, psychology and English.</p> <p>Wes Streeting, the president of the NUS, said: \"We welcome the overall rise in people entering higher education. However, the incremental increase in the number of poorer students accepting university places is not good enough. </p> <p>\"Institutions must not be complacent when it comes to widening participation among those groups who have not traditionally attended university.</p> <p>\"They must also be careful to give a fair chance to those who have gained qualifications other than A-levels, but who may nonetheless benefit from higher education.\"</p> <p>Bill Rammell, the minister for higher education, said: \"I am particularly encouraged by the increase in acceptances from lower socioeconomic groups as we continue to work to widen participation in higher education through, for example, greater links between universities and schools and the Aimhigher programme.\"</p>",
  "<p>Back pain. If you haven't got it now, the chances are you've either had it in the past or will get it in the future. Statistics show that seven in 10 of us suffer from it at some time in our lives. And it is one of the most common causes of sickness absence and disability in the western world. In fact, research from the British Chiropractic Association earlier this year found that in the UK, back pain is on the increase, rising from 47% of people \"currently suffering\" in 2007, to 52% in 2008.</p> <p>Although the days when bed rest was the standard treatment for chronic back pain are long gone, the medical profession has yet to find a single effective solution that it can uniformly prescribe, thanks to a dearth of scientific evidence and, where studies have taken place, conflicting findings. But one back-pain treatment option for which there has been little funded research in the past (and therefore, scant evidence to support its use) is now making news in the medical community - the Alexander Technique (AT). </p> <p>A study published this week in the British Medical Journal reports the results of a large-scale trial on the effects of AT on back pain. The study, which took place at GP practices in Southampton and Bristol, hypothesised that AT could alleviate back pain by limiting muscle spasm, strengthening postural muscles, improving coordination and flexibility, and decompressing the spine. One year on, the results bear this out: subjects who received 24 AT lessons reported an average of three days of back pain per month, compared with 21 days per month in the control group. The AT group also reported better function and quality of life.</p> <p>So what is AT? I've asked many an Alexander teacher this over the years, and it's a question that even they find difficult to answer. \"What AT isn't is a series of gentle exercises,\" says Elizabeth Dodgson, an AT teacher in west London, and a trustee of the charity BackCare. \"It's not about being taught fixed positions (postures) in which to hold the body and it isn't manipulation, like, say, physiotherapy or massage.\" </p> <p>Dodgson is happier talking about what AT does, than what it is. \"The goal of AT is to set up the right circumstances under which the body can function as it was meant to,\" she explains. \"You're learning the tools you need to use your body more effectively and efficiently and getting to know your patterns and habits, so you can let go of the bad ones. The hands-on element is important because it helps you feel how a movement can be different. That's difficult to do from a book.'</p> <p>It's no coincidence that AT talks of pupils and teachers, rather than therapists and patients: there is a strong educational element involved. AT sessions are usually one on one, and the onus is on exploration and awareness rather than on forcing and fixing things. </p> <p>Many common therapies involve lying down while someone \"does\" something to you but AT is a practice that you \"do\" yourself. Does Dodgson think that this \"taking part\" in your own treatment is an important factor? \"Definitely. By the time people walk through the door, they are usually willing to change something,\" she says. \"They've been through the 'my back's not working - can you fix it?' mindset and tried a lot of other things so by the time they come to me they are more open to change.\" </p> <p>The difficulty in pinning down what AT is, or doing it yourself at home, is probably one of the reasons why it hasn't been embraced by the medical profession, thus far. \"With physiotherapy, you can receive some treatment and be shown all the exercises you need to do in, say, six sessions,\" says Dodgson. \"With AT there's no clear timescale or end point. It's a bit like learning a musical instrment. At what point have you 'learned it?'\" Lessons cost around \u00a330 each, and Dodgson says that after 20-30 lessons you should have learned enough about your body to continue working on your own.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To find an AT teacher visit <a href=\"http://www.stat.org.uk\">stat.org.uk</a>.

Indeed, a study from Queen's University in Ontario, Canada, found that it was valuable in alleviating non-specific lower back pain. But Lynne Robinson, director of the Body Control Pilates association advises, proceeding with caution. \"Pilates is not a treatment for back pain,\" she says. \"We don't diagnose and we don't treat - our role comes after treatment, and any good teacher will ideally work one-to-one, in conjunction with the client's medical practitioner.\" </p> <p>A key element of Pilates is core stability training - exercises to work on the deep-set muscles situated in the trunk and pelvic area that have a role in protecting the spine and keeping the \"core\" of the body stable. A recent study from the University of Queensland found that isolation of the deep abdominal muscles could successfully improve recruitment patterns in lower back pain sufferers, reducing pain. But, contrary to popular belief about Pilates, it's not all about the core. \"Pilates is brilliant for backs because it works the spine through all its planes of movement,\" says Robinson. \"Extension, flexion, rotation and side flexion - as well as teaching good body awareness and use, improving breathing and posture.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To find a qualified Pilates teacher, visit <a href=\"http://www.pilatesfoundation.com\">pilatesfoundation.com</a>. </p> <p><strong>Chiropractic</strong></p> <p>There's a lot more to chiropractic than crunching and clicking bones and joints, according to Tim Hutchful from the British Chiropractic Assocation. \"Chiropractic is wrongly pereceived to be simply a manipulative technique - that's just like saying dentists only do fillings,\" he says. \"It's actually a complete package of care, which could involve everything from hands-on treatment to postural assessment and stretching.\"</p> <p>\"Most back pain is accumulative.\" says Hutchful. \"Symptoms are the last thing to come and the first thing to go - so we tend to blame the problem on the last action we did, rather than looking at the bigger picture.\" There has been some controversy about manipulative techniques, however, Hutchful argues that the chiropractic treatment package offers the opportunity to prevent the likelihood of problems happening in the first place, by addressing everything from the pen you write with to the way you pick up your baby. \"When a patient walks in, yes, I want to alleviate their pain, but I also want to look at its cause and the aggravating factors, because without addressing these, the problem will return.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To find a chiropractor, contact the British Chiropractic Association <a href=\"http://www.chiropractic-uk.co.uk\">chiropractic-uk.co.uk</a>. </p> <p><strong>Osteopathy</strong></p> <p>While a Pilates or AT teacher isn't qualified to diagnose your back pain or prescribe treatment, an osteopath is. In fact, osteopaths specialise in dealing with back pain - non-specific chronic cases as well as acute injuries and post-surgery rehabilitation. \"The role of the osteopath is to help the individual manage themselves in ways that will optimise their recovery,\" says Professor Eyal Lederman, who is registered with the General Osteopathic Council. \"Treatment will likely involve a combination of hands-on treatment, movement re-education and exercises to practise at home, as well as the development of coping strategies.\" Even while looking specifically at back pain, an osteopath will take into account the health of the entire musculoskeletal system and treat the whole body, rather than just focusing on a specific symptom or region of pain. </p> <p>While many people find relief from back pain from osteopathy (expect to feel the benefits within two to six sessions) one study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that it was no more effective than \"standard care\". That's not to say that it is ineffective - just that both approaches work equally well (and osteopathy subjects need fewer painkillers).</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To find a registered osteopath contact the General Osteopathic Council, <a href=\"http://www.osteopathy.org.uk\">osteopathy.org.uk</a>.

It is based on the theory of energy or \"chi\" pathways throughout the body. Problems occur when there is an energy blockage, and acupuncture needles are said to help get energy flowing freely again. A study from the University of Maryland lends weight to this argument - researchers analysing the findings of 33 different studies concluded that it did have a positive effect on lower back pain - in the short term. But what about in the long term? One small British study found a modest reduction in back pain in patients who received 10 sessions over a three-month period - and pain levels were still lower than a control group two years later. </p> <p>Acupuncture is also said to increase levels of the natural pain-killing chemicals in the brain, endorphins, as well as relaxing the muscles.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> For more information, contact the British Acupuncture Council: <a href=\"http://www.acupuncture.org.uk\">acupuncture.org.uk</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Giovanni Trapattoni's preparations for the Republic of Ireland's World Cup qualifier against Georgia next month have already been plunged into disarray by the news that the fixture will be moved to a neutral venue, so the last thing the former AC Milan manager would have wanted was to face a strong Norwegian side in near-to-unplayable conditions in Oslo last night.</p> <p>Robbie Keane scored his 34th international goal on the stroke of half-time here but his clinical finish, after a rare Norwegian defensive lapse, was later cancelled out by Tore Reginiussen's first goal for his country, which resulted from a Dean Kieley error.</p> <p>\"In the first half, both teams played well when the pitch was good and it was possible to play football and we achieved a goal,\" Trapattoni said. \"But in the second half, it was impossible to play football like in the first half. The result was fair because in the second half, we were under pressure.\"</p> <p>The Irish captain Keane was angry over the state of the playing surface. \"The conditions in the second half completely ruined the game.\"</p> <p>The Norwegians will feel aggrieved not to have gone on to claim victory after exerting intense pressure for the remainder of the game. But Ireland battled to hang on and extend their new manager's unbeaten start - this was his third game - while at the same time leaving their fans in little doubt that there is work to be done before they meet Georgia - wherever that game is played - and then, four days later, Montenegro. </p> <p>Norway's 4-3-3 formation initially caused Ireland problems with central defender Richard Dunne in particular having difficulty keeping his feet after torrential rain. Shay Given was grateful to see the impressive debutant striker Mohammed Abdellaoue lift a 10th-minute shot over the bar after running on to the ex-Liverpool player John Arne Riise's pass.</p> <p>Riise forced the game's first real save 12 minutes later with a dipping drive which Given claimed low to his right. However, as the half wore on, it was the visitors who began to control the match with the Irish wingers Damien Duff and Aiden McGeady seeing plenty of the ball as Steven Reid and Glenn Whelan held firm in central midfield.</p> <p>Norway were still coming to terms with the premature departure of their midfielder Fredrik Stromstad when Keane cut inside and fired past Jarstein.</p> <p>In the second half Norway enjoyed the better of the game and the equaliser finally arrived six minutes later when Kiely came for, but missed, Martin Andresen's left-wing free-kick, and when a stunned Kevin Kilbane could only head the ball back across goal, Reginiussen converted. The home side attacked but met a resilent Ireland defence, one of the postives Trapattoni will take into his Georgia clash.</p>",
  "<p>When Labour cabinet members were asked about their religious allegiances last December, following Tony Blair's official conversion to Roman Catholicism, it turned out that more than half of them are not believers. The least equivocal about their atheism were the health secretary, Alan Johnson, and foreign secretary David Miliband.</p> <p>The fact that Miliband is an atheist is a matter of special interest given the likelihood that he may one day, and perhaps soon, occupy No 10. In our present uncomfortable climate of quarrels between pushy religionists and resisting secularists - or attack-dog secularists and defensive religionists: which side you are on determines how you see it - there are many reasons why it would be a great advantage to everyone to have an atheist prime minister. </p> <p>Atheist leaders are not going to think they are getting messages from Beyond telling them to go to war. They will not cloak themselves in supernaturalistic justifications, as Blair came perilously close to doing when interviewed about the decision to invade Iraq.</p> <p>Atheist leaders will be sceptical about the claims of religious groups to be more important than other civil society organisations in doing good, getting public funds, meriting special privileges and exemptions from laws, and having seats in the legislature and legal protection from criticism, satire and challenge.</p> <p>Atheist leaders are going to be more sceptical about inculcating sectarian beliefs into small children ghettoised into publicly funded faith-based schools, risking social divisiveness and possible future conflict. They will be readier to learn Northern Ireland's bleak lesson in this regard.</p> <p>Atheist leaders will, by definition, be neutral between the different religious pressure groups in society, and will have no temptation not to be even-handed because of an allegiance to the outlook of just one of those groups.</p> <p>Atheist leaders are more likely to take a literally down-to-earth view of the needs, interests and circumstances of people in the here and now, and will not be influenced by the belief that present sufferings and inequalities will be compensated in some posthumous dispensation. This is not a trivial point: for most of history those lower down the social ladder have been promised a perch at the top when dead, and kept quiet thereby. The claim that in an imperfect world one's hopes are better fixed on the afterlife than on hopes of earthly paradises is official church doctrine.</p> <p>Atheist leaders will not be tempted to think they are the messenger of any good news from above, or the agent of any higher purpose on earth. Or at very least, they will not think this literally.</p> <p>Best of all, if David Miliband becomes prime minister, the prospect of disestablishment of the Church of England will have come closer. This is a matter of importance, for two chief reasons. The first is that the CofE's privileged position gives other religious groups too much incentive to try sharp-elbowing their way into getting similar privileges, such as the ear of ministers, tax exemptions, public funding for their own sect's faith schools, and the big prize of seats in the legislature.</p> <p>Secondly, the CofE has far too big a footprint in the public domain, out of all proportion to the actual numbers it represents: just 2% of the population go weekly to its churches. Yet it controls the primary school system - 80% of it - and a substantial proportion of the secondary school system, with dozens more academy schools soon due to fall under its control. It is entitled to have 26 bishops sitting in the House of Lords, plus a number more who have been made life peers on retiring; and it has the automatic ear of government - do not suppose that if Rowan Williams phones No 10 he is told no one is at home.</p> <p>Having a statedly atheist British prime minister makes it more likely that the functional secularity of British life and politics, the foregoing exceptions noted, will become actual secularity. Secularism means that matters of public policy and government are not under the influence, still less control, of sectarian religious interests. The phrase \"separation of church and state\" does not quite capture the sense in which a genuinely secular arrangement keeps religious voices on a par with all other non-governmental voices in the public square, and all the non-governmental players in the public square separate from the government itself. It means that churches and religious movements have to see themselves as civil society organisations like trades unions, political parties, the Scouts, and so on: with every right to exist, and to have their say, but as self-constituted interest groups no more entitled to a bigger share of the public pie of influence, privilege, tax handouts, and legal exemptions than any other self-appointed interest group.</p> <p>As things stand, religious groups in our society get a slice of the pie vastly larger than their numbers or merits truly justify. The big advantage of an atheist prime minister would be that he or she would see that fact, and act accordingly. An atheist is not going to have the lingering sense that because someone has chosen to believe one or another ancient dogma, he is to be respected and honoured, listened to, given the public's money to bring up his children in the same beliefs and exempted from some of the laws of the land.</p> <p>Note that none of the foregoing represents either a desire or a prediction that an atheist prime minister will actively militate against religion, certainly not by outlawing it or passing laws that make religious observance more difficult. Instead, one result of the removal of privileges and public money might be that the artificial amplification of religious voices and points of view in our society, and the hold that religion can exert on children and the psychologically needy, might become less. Religion flourishes in conditions of active support and active persecution; in a socially and politically liberal climate it diminishes through natural causes. </p> <p>Religion is a matter of choice in that, unlike race, age, gender or disability, you can change it, or not have it at all. True, most people's faith was driven into them when they were small children, and belief can be hard to shake off if your community will reject or hurt you for your apostasy. But it is still fundamentally voluntary. As such it should pay its own way and take its place in the queue along with everyone else. That is something that an atheist prime minister might say, and we might all breathe a great deal more easily as a result.</p> <p>Despite appearances, the world is not seeing a resurgence of religion, only a big turning-up of the volume of religious voices. This is itself a response to increasing secularism among people tired of the disruptions, obstructions and conflicts religion so often causes. Public acknowledgement of atheism by a senior politician who might soon lead his country is just one indicator of the fact that the tide is actually running in the opposite direction: and that is a welcome and hopeful sign.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>AC Grayling is professor of philosophy at Birkbeck College, University of London <a href=\"mailto:a.grayling@philosophy.bbk.ac.uk\">a.grayling@philosophy.bbk.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>\u00b7</strong> British windsurfer Bryony Shaw made a splash for two reasons yesterday, taking the bronze medal in a dramatic race in Qingdao then swearing on live television shortly after.</p> <p>Shaw told the BBC: \"It was such a hard race and I had such a hard week. It's the best thing in the world. I am so fucking happy.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the BBC later apologised for any offence caused. He added: \"Our reporter on the spot Rob Walker apologised immediately and Adrian Chiles apologised again when the footage cut back to the studio.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Five American blogger-activists and an artist have been detained in Beijing, Students for a Free Tibet said yesterday. The group appeared to have been taken in early on Tuesday morning.</p> <p>The artist, James Powderly, is thought to have been preparing to use a laser to beam a new work onto a billboard or building. It is thought that two of the others were with him and one, Brian Conley, sent a text message to his wife reading: \"In jail. All fine.\"</p> <p>Two of the activists had filmed and photographed another SFT protest. The group has held several in Beijing despite the tight security and over 30 of their activists have been deported.</p> <p>\"Competent authorities have the right to handle these things according to law,\" foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> As Brazil headed to a painful 3-0 defeat against Argentina in Tuesday's football semi-final, a chant began to resound around the Workers' Stadium. It was not, revealed one fan, directed at either team. \"Xie Yalong, xia ke!\" was instead an call to sack Xie Yalong, president of the Chinese football association. Chinese fans are outraged by their country's poor performance - particularly striking when set against the 44 gold medals notched up in other disciplines.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Chinese state grid is prioritising supplies to the Olympics as the summer power shortfall increases, officials said yesterday. The country faces its worst shortage in four years and several areas are struggling with blackouts and rationing, with power firms cutting their output because of low coal supplies and caps on electricity prices.</p> <p>Beijing spent 20bn yuan increasing its grid capacity in preparation for the games. But businesses in other areas complain they are feeling the knock-on effects. Shanxi province, which is one of the largest suppliers of energy to the capital, is among the worst-hit.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The abrupt exit of Liu Xiang, left, was doubly disappointing to some, it appears. The 110 metres hurdles final was one of the hottest tickets in town, with touts asking for as much as 20,000 yuan (\u00a31,500) apiece at one stage. Now the price has plummeted, leaving many out of pocket. A woman near the Olympic Green said: \"I bought my tickets for 5,000 each and I just wanted to see Liu Xiang. Now I don't want to go and I can't sell them.\"</p>",
  "<p>For the Atlanta Games in 1996, the French synchronised swimming team prepared a routine based on the Holocaust. They were to goose-step toward the pool, before diving in and re-enacting the arrival of female Jews at the concentration camps, their abuse by Nazi doctors and their last march to the gas chambers. It would be set to music from Schindler's List. Alas, reminding us why politicians should never meddle in sport, they were ordered to abandon the enterprise by the then French sports minister, despite their protestations that it had \"great emotional value\".</p> <p>In yesterday's synchronised duets final, the Russian pair of Anastasia Davydova and Anastasia Ermakova took gold without having their artistic vision compromised by some hypersensitive Kremlin drone. Their routine was inspired by the arguably less controversial Peer Gynt Suite. Having led from the earlier technical round, the Anastasias produced a spectacular freestyle routine, for which they scored perfect marks from every judge.</p> <p>Spain won silver, while Japan took bronze, but there was disappointment for China's identical twins Jiang Tingting and Jiang Wenwen. Despite having a move that literally no one else can do - they make a square with their legs that usually takes four swimmers - they just missed out on a medal for their routine titled Que Yue. </p> <p>Que Yue apparently translates as \"little birds jumping and flying happily\", for anyone imagining an aquatic rendering of the Great Leap famine.</p> <p>One of two sets of twins in this event (think of it as Mother Nature's version of performance enhancement), the Jiangs even synchronise digestive complaints. \"If one of them was to say 'I have a stomach ache',\" their coach explained, \"the other would say 'Me too'.\"</p> <p>Highlights of the final? The Chinese twins acknowledging crowd cheers with synchronised waves. The sequinned, appliqued drops of blood on the backs of the Ukrainian pair's military-themed swimsuits - totally unexplained, and apparently not something they cared to discuss with the media after the event. The IOC's Davros, Juan Antonio Samaranch, lunging in for the kiss that is owed him - owed him, I tell you! - each time he hands over a medal. Actually that's not true. He let the Japanese girls off. Then there was the American pair's revelation that their competition build-up involves an hour in hair and make-up. The secret to those patent-smooth heads? Flavourless gelatine, kids. There is no more noble cause in which a cow could die.</p> <p>Not that these painted ladies aren't tough. One of the American synchronised swimming team set the all-time, all-gender record for consecutive press-ups at the US Olympic Training Centre in Colorado, and their head choreographer Stephan Miermont has promised Saturday's team routine will change everything you thought you knew about synchronised swimming. The USA are going to - and this is a technical term - bring it.</p> <p>He explains he has gone back to the Bible for inspiration; he claims the routine is so complex many who see it will not understand it. Come Saturday night, a new synchronised swimming will rise from the water: faster, higher, stronger - and maybe even camper. </p> <p>Frankly, you have to love a sports coach who announces, as Miermont did this week: \"I don't really care about the score, we can't control that. What I want is a standing ovation.\" Stephan is used to those, having been a choreographer at Cirque Du Soleil. Hopefully Saturday won't find one of his rivals snorting \"Was that your routine? Or a performance of Cirque Du So Lame?\" </p> <p>World cinema fans will recognise the line as one of Will Ferrell's from the figure-skating, stereotype-busting meisterwerk that is Blades of Glory - and the reference couldn't be more relevant. Synchronised swimming is currently living the plot of a Will Ferrell movie. Put briefly: it's a sport with a glass ceiling. And because of the Guardian's commitment to examining the gender discrimination issues that affect us all, you need to hear about Kenyon Smith, an 18-year-old American champion who many believe would be on the US synchronised team were it not for the fact that he just happens to be a guy. </p> <p>Only women are allowed to compete in synchronised swimming at the Olympics - just like they get all the best jobs and higher pay and stuff in real life. But seriously: Kenyon is the lone male swimmer with the prestigious Californian Aquamaids club, a veritable hotbed of female US synch team members. He came second in national competition, where men can compete with women; and he so wanted to come to Beijing that he attended the Olympic trials. Kenyon had made the second-to-last cut when his coach was informed he was disqualified on gender grounds. The Federation International de Natation Amateur ruled that \"we cannot allow men in a women's sport\". </p> <p>Yes, this one has Ferrell written all over it. For now, though, it's just a lone guy in sequins fighting the system, and even those Russians' joy should be tinged with a tear for him. Their make-up can definitely take it.</p>",
  "<p>The politician, social reformer, writer and lawyer Leo Abse, who has died aged 91, was a unique figure in the public life of our time. He reflected, and transmitted in grandiloquent style, the paradoxes of our age along with his own egocentric capacity to express, often in pyrotechnic rhetoric, the contradictions and absurdities in all our lives. He was a leftwing socialist with a Disraelian quality of showmanship, and a product of a Welsh\u2013Jewish idealism oft times coated with Celtic imagery \u2014 always laced with a Jewish romanticism he sought, pointlessly, to disguise.</p> <p>Abse painted the British political scene with a Freudian brush, and for 29 years from Labour's backbenches provided the House of Commons with a passionate, idiosyncratic dialogue. He had entered parliament rather late, aged 41, following a sparkling legal career in south Wales. Then, after leaving the house in 1987, he opened his third career, as a political biographer with a series of books that sought to place the figureheads of the British political system on a Freudian couch. Harold -Wilson, Hugh Gaitskell, Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, even his closest political friends such as Michael Foot and Roy Jenkins \u2014 almost no one escaped Abse's psychoanalytical radar sweep.</p> <p>In his final years, approaching his 90th birthday, he moved into deeper literary history with an extraordinary new examination of the life and sexual behaviour of Daniel Defoe, into which Abse poured much of his own self-analysis. At the time of his death, he was working on a psychoanalytical study of the great Biblical characters of Moses, Noah, Ham and Jubal. His unfinished notes on a final chapter remain with his secretary.</p> <p>All of this came after a career of almost three decades as an MP, first for Pontypool (1958-83) and, after boundary changes, for Torfaen (1983-87), during which he pioneered more private member's legislation than any other 20th-century parliamentarian. All Abse's bills related to human relationships and social welfare \u2014 divorce, women's rights, widows' damages, family planning, industrial injuries, his groundbreaking 1967 bill on homosexuality and, perhaps most crucial of all, the Children Act (1975), which dealt with fostering and adoption. He initiated the first Commons debates on genetic engineering and in-vitro pregnancies.</p> <p>He consistently rejected min-isterial offers; indeed, he had no time for Wilson's leadership of the Labour party, and in 1969 and 1970 campaigned to remove him. He admired James -Callaghan, yet still turned down his offer, when home secretary, to serve with him. But he remained close to Callaghan, and also to Roy Jenkins, despite their ideological differences. Abse respected Jenkins, and during the two periods when Jenkins was home secretary (1965-67 and 1974-76), Abse was a close adviser on much of his social reforming work. Had he wished, they could have formed a formidable ministerial partnership.</p> <p>Abse scorned political heroes, yet he made an exception in one outstanding case, Aneurin Bevan. He regarded Bevan as the greatest orator of his lifetime, the archetypal socialist and, apart from Sigmund Freud, the one man on the public stage he regarded as \"special\". How did all this square with his friendship with the liberal Jenkins? Such contradictions were dismissed by Abse as inconsequential. \"I deal with people, not facile reputations,\" he once told me.</p> <p>Abse was born in Cardiff, the youngest of four siblings (Wilfred, Dannie and their sister Hulda), grandchildren of -Jewish immigrants who had settled in south Wales. His maternal grandfather, Tobias, had quit Simyatich, a township in Tsarist Russian Poland, in 1874 to arrive penniless in Swansea, but both sets of grandparents contained elements that showed up in the Abse cocktail \u2014 pioneering socialism, Talmudic devotion, atheism, entrepreneurism, anarchism and Marxism.</p> <p>By the time Abse reached the age of six, his paternal grandfather had built up an empire of small cinemas which Leo's father, Rudolf, had squandered away to just one playhouse in Aberavon. But it was on the stage at that establishment that the child Abse started addressing audiences. His younger brother, the doctor and poet Dannie Abse, claims that this was where Leo developed his rhetoric. \"He just enjoyed being looked at,\" says Dannie.</p> <p>It was the eldest of the three Abse brothers, Wilfred, who opened Leo's imagination to the books on and by Freud. He was a doctor who specialised in pyschiatry. Together with their mother, Kate, he became the strongest influence in the development of the young Abse \u2014 though the influence of his mother's sister Lily Tobias, a novelist and socialist, was probably significant when Leo, aged 17, joined the Cardiff Labour party, and then took a job at a local glass works, where he joined the Transport and General Workers Union. At 21, he fought his first election as a candidate for Cardiff city council, on which he later served for many years before unsuccessfully contesting the safe Tory seat of Cardiff North in 1955 and three years later taking Pontypool.</p> <p>During the war he served as an aircraftsman in the RAF, mostly in the -Middle East where, in 1944, he was involved with the Forces Parliament in Cairo, an elected grouping of rank-and-file servicemen who defied the military establishment to set up a mock assembly. Abse was elected its \"chancellor of the exchequer\", but was then arrested, along with others, only to be quickly released after protests at Westminster led by Bevan, Manny Shinwell and DN Pritt. </p> <p>Abse's legal career began after the war. With a demobilisation grant, he took law classes at the London School of Economics, and qualified as a solicitor, setting up his own practice, Abse &amp; Cohen, which specialised in criminal cases; he took a particular interest in defending suspected murderers, during which process he finessed his growing fascination with pyschoanalysis. Abse &amp; Cohen developed into one of the most influential law firms in south Wales, and one in which he retained an interest to the end.</p> <p>When he retired from parliament in 1987, his nomination to the House of Lords was blocked by Thatcher, hardly a surprise, though his devastating critique of Thatcherism and his book about her, Margaret, Daughter of Beatrice: A Psychobiography of Margaret Thatcher, was not published until 1989. Even so, his reputation as a political biographer \u2014 or, as his critics claimed, \"a psycho-babbler\" \u2014 had already been established with the publication of Private Member: A Psychoanalytically Orientated Study of Contemporary Politics (1973), which upset almost everyone.</p> <p>There followed his books on Germany and the Germans, Wotan, My Enemy: Can Britain live with the Germans? (1994), a Freudian examination of how a civilised nation managed to produce Hitler. Then came two books on Blair in which Abse derided New Labour with contempt dosed in psychoanalysis \u2014 The Man Behind the Smile; Tony Blair and the Politics of Perversion, (1996) and then a more savage denunciation still, Tony Blair \u2014 The Man Who Lost His Smile (2003). Between these two books came Fellatio, Masochism, Politics and Love (2003), which puts virtually every aspect of modern life under Abse's Freudian microscope and concludes with a cry for political courage to ex-tricate the nation, and the world, from a political and moral morass.</p> <p>Abse's first marriage, in 1955, to Marjorie Davies, a Welsh artist, designer and head at the Cardiff College of Art, was an immense success. With their two children, Tobias and Bathsheba, they formed a close and warm family until Marjorie's death, at 77, in 1996; that devastated the family, notably Abse who was almost 80. Three years later, he met Ania Czepulkowska, a Polish artist in her early 30s studying at the Royal College of Art, and they married in 2000 \u2014 the year he published Politics of Love.</p> <p>The marriage startled his friends, strained family relations and evoked widespread comment \u2014 not always friendly. Yet Abse's closest friends, and especially his aged brother Wilfred, offered solace. Abse himself rationalised it all with a frequent testimony: \"It is Ania who keeps me alive.\" She and his children survive him.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Leopold Abse, politician, writer, historian and lawyer, born April 22 1917; died August 19 2008</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/17/zimbabwe\">power-sharing talks</a> between the Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe and the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai have been presented as the best hope of bringing peace to the embattled country. However, power-sharing agreements are in fact a poor strategy for resolving conflicts. They are extremely difficult to reach and possibly even more difficult to implement and sustain. Power sharing is not a credible or viable solution to the crisis in Zimbabwe, either in the immediate or longer term. It is unlikely to bring a durable peace, is inherently undemocratic and rewards ruthless behaviour.</p> <p>Power-sharing deals are difficult to negotiate under the best of circumstances. Reaching an agreement in Zimbabwe will be particularly problematic, for at least three reasons. First, the ruling party's interest in sharing power is highly questionable. Negotiators from Zanu-PF are reportedly refusing to consider ceding any executive powers to an opposition prime minister \u2013 the main bone of contention in the power-sharing agreement that ended a standoff following Kenya's December 2007 elections. Zanu-PF is only sitting at the bargaining table because of international pressure, notably from South Africa and other neighbours, and will be loth to compromise. While the opposition is more likely to be negotiating in good faith than the government, the failure of talks may help the MDC's case that Zanu-PF is intransigent and that sterner international pressure will be required. </p> <p>Another major impediment to agreement is the lack of trust between actors. Not only has the ruling party brutalised MDC officials and supporters in myriad ways since 2000, its previous power-sharing agreement serves as a stern warning to the MDC. In 1987, a deal was signed between Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo, the leader of the then main opposition party. Nkomo was brought in as a figurehead vice-president and the deal resulted in his party's absorption and disbandment, serving to consolidate Mugabe's power.</p> <p>A third challenge is internal fragmentation. Though not as significant as the multiplication of actors that have plagued negotiations in the Democratic Republic of Congo or Darfur, both Zanu-PF and the MDC are factionalised. Not all perspectives are represented at the bargaining table and further splits may be forthcoming if any eventual agreement displeases significant wings on one or both sides. For instance, even if <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/14/zimbabwe\">Arthur Mutambara's MDC faction</a> signs a separate agreement with Mugabe, his 10 MPs might defect to the main MDC wing, leaving Zanu-PF no closer to achieving a parliamentary majority. In addition, high-ranking military officials in Zanu-PF, who have consolidated political and economic power in recent years, may prevent Mugabe from reaching an agreement detrimental to their interests. </p> <p>Even if a deal is reached, three principal challenges threaten its viability. First, governing elites might lack the commitment to applying the terms of the agreement. They might actually only be seeking to co-opt the opposition and could renege on the agreement if they fail. Alternatively, there may be institutional resistance to sharing power. For instance, where the bureaucracy of the state and a party apparatus have been one and the same for a long time, a political agreement at the top does not guarantee compliance at the middle and lower echelons of government, and indeed resistance may be orchestrated from the top. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sudan\">Sudan</a>, members of the National Congress party continue to dominate state institutions, in spite of the power-sharing provisions of the 2003 comprehensive peace agreement that ended the north-south conflict. </p> <p>Second, government and opposition elites might lack the ability to deliver their commitments, particularly where key parts of their constituency are resistant to a political deal. Veterans, one of Mugabe's most powerful constituencies, may attempt to spoil a transfer of executive powers if they fear losing influence. This is not unique to Zimbabwe. Veterans have obstructed progress in other locales such as the Serb entity in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p> <p>Third, the MDC's shortcomings might impede power sharing. Where incumbents have been in power for a very long time, the opposition's capacity to govern is likely to be limited. That was the case in Sudan, where the Sudan People's Liberation Movement found itself propelled to a governing position overnight. Permitting ill-equipped opposition leaders to assume positions of responsibility is also a way of ensuring they will stumble and fall, especially when assigned near-impossible tasks. For this reason, one could expect Mugabe to give Tsvangirai responsibility for redressing Zimbabwe's economic woes.</p> <p>Even if a power-sharing arrangement was a viable option and could prevent more violence in the shorter or longer term, it is not necessarily a strategy worth pursuing. Allowing a small number of elites to determine outcomes is inherently undemocratic, and manifestly ignores voters' choices. It would make more sense to hold new elections as soon as possible, preferably under a caretaker government. Otherwise, a terrible precedent is set, encouraging politicians who are not committed to democracy to attempt to steal elections and then, through power-sharing agreements, secure a much stronger position than they otherwise would have held. The Zimbabwean opposition and international actors would be well advised to consider this before supporting further negotiations.</p> <p><em>Chandra Lekha Sriram is director of the Centre on Human Rights in Conflict at the University of East London School of Law and author of Peace as governance: Armed groups, power-sharing, and contemporary peace negotiations. <br>Marie-Jo\u00eblle Zahar is associate professor of political science at the University of Montreal specialising in the politics of power-sharing and conflict resolution</em></p>",
  "<p> Peter Moore has been promising it since he took up his tenure as president of EA Sports - a sports sim that reacts to the events in its real-world counterpart. Madden already features regular roster updates, but now footie is getting in on the act. EA announced today that FIFA 09 purchasers will be able to sign up to a weekly update service, which updates the in-game stats based on occurrences in the English Premier League, La Liga BBVA, Ligue 1, Bundesliga, Serie A and Mexican Primera Division. From the press release:</p> <blockquote> <br> <p>The adidas Live Season service is based on how real players performed in the most recent real-world matches. Gameplay will change dynamically as the performance of players and football teams in the real world experience the highs and lows during their campaigns.</p> </blockquote> <br> <blockquote> <br> <p>A global network of football scouts will monitor every player in the adidas Live Season leagues throughout the season to supply accurate and in-depth player and team data each week. Player attributes will be impacted and player performance will change dynamically. The adidas Live Season service is downloaded into FIFA 09 each week and will run from the launch of the game to the end of the 2008-2009 season.</p> </blockquote> <br> <p>Ah, but there's an interesting wrinkle. The release points out that gamers get 'a free trial' to one league of their choice, until the close of the 2008-2009 season. After this, there will be a weekly subscription, which EA has not yet disclosed.</p> <p>Of course, this all ties in with the publisher's determination to create new revenue streams away from the traditional, expensive and risky retail model. Inspired by the Korean market, the company is already exploring billed downloadable content - hence the controversy over Bad Company, and the forthcoming Battlefield Heroes.</p> <p>EA is also keen on building a more 'intimate' relationship with its fanbase. At the moment the relationship between FIFA fans and FIFA publisher is confined to an annual purchase and maybe an email newsletter. But with weekly downloads, a much closer bond can be developed, and this bond alone - regardless of any subscription fee - can be monetised. Hence the Adidas sponsorship.</p> <p>The question is, how many gamers actually want their FIFA experience to be shaded by the vagaries of the real footie season? As A Man City supporter, I'd like to play Valeri Bojinov upfront, but if I downloaded the update, would he be out of action for six months? As for player form - this has been fictionalised for years in PES and FIFA; would a realistically timed version be any more compelling? It would perhaps, save keen football followers the chore of having to analyse in-game player stats to check who's in tip-top condition and who's coasting - just watch Match of the Day instead.</p> <p>The next step will be downloadable football boots, alice bands and goal celebrations. Then, the user-generated angle: customisable crowd chants, pitch patterns and commentary.</p> <p>Will you be partaking?</p>",
  "<p>The 2008 presidential election in the US may well leave us all waxing nostalgic for the good old disaster days of 2000 and 2004.<br> Given the asterisks in the record books next to both of those elections, you might think that Democrats, the victims of the anti-democratic (small \"d\") attacks in both elections, would have spent the intervening years putting virtually all resources into making sure there wouldn't be another such electoral disaster in 2008. You would have been horribly mistaken. In addition to proving miserable failures (though, admittedly, they didn't try very hard) at rolling back the tsunami of wholly unverifiable electronic voting systems now set for use, misuse and utter breakdown across the country this November, the Democrats have also made little headway in ending what will be one of the most troubling problems this year: voter disenfranchisement via phony Republican claims of \"voter fraud\". The Republicans, on the other hand, have been at work for years developing their anti-democratic (small \"d\" again, but it may as well be a capital \"D\") schemes. For a glimpse at what may well be the Rosetta Stone of Republican disenfranchisement efforts, one need look no further than at what <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Weyrich\">Paul Weyrich</a>, one of the founding fathers of modern American conservatism, told a gathering of some 15,000 preachers at a training conference in Dallas, Texas in 1980 (at which both Ronald Reagan and the right-wing Rev. Jerry Falwell also shared the podium).<br> \"Many of our Christians have what I call the goo-goo syndrome - good government. They want everybody to vote,\" Weyrich instructed the flock in comments <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GBAsFwPglw\">captured on video</a>.<br> \"I don't want everybody to vote,\" he continued unapologetically. \"Elections are not won by a majority of people, they never have been from the beginning of our country and they are not now.\" And here comes the key to what will be the most crucial driving force for the entire Republican party effort this November: \"As a matter of fact, our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the voting populace goes down.\" Thus spoke Weyrich in 1980, and the party leaders have followed in good faith ever since. Their disciples continue today to regularly advise the most powerful Republican insiders in the country. And thus have they gone forth to find every measure - no matter how adverse to the key American value of democracy, or how expensive the cost may be - to keep legitimate, legal voters from being able to cast their vote and have that vote counted accurately. Not every voter, of course. Just the ones who tend to vote Democratic (capital \"D\"). The easiest ones to target among those who don't tend to vote Republican: African-Americans, Hispanics, the elderly, the urban poor and even students. All in the hopes, as Weyrich urged, of keeping Republican \"leverage in ... elections ... up\" by keeping \"the voting populace ... down\". <a href=\"http://www.lwv.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;CONTENTID=11254&amp;TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm\">According to</a> the non-partisan League of Women voters, some 21 million Americans do not have the type of photo identification required by the most draconian types of polling-place photo ID restrictions that are now being pushed - by hook and by crook - in states across the country. Among that group, some 25% of African-Americans, 18% of Americans over 65, 10% of the 40 million Americans with disabilities, 15% of low-income voters and untold numbers of voting-aged college students who reside in states other than where they may have valid drivers' licenses would have difficulty voting under such laws. (You may <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=5979\">add to the Republican enemies list</a>: married women, hurricane victims and those suffering from palsy, if you like.)<br> With that in mind, the Republicans have <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/ACVR\">stopped at nothing</a>, in order to see such laws passed wherever possible, and otherwise enforced nonetheless even where such poll restrictions have been found by the courts to be illegal and/or unconstitutional.<br> An <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=5932\">unprecedented decision</a> by the now rightward-slanted US supreme court earlier this year, allowed such a law to stand in Indiana. The result: the disenfranchised in the state's May primary election included <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=5960\">college students and nuns in their 80s and 90s from St Mary's Convent</a> (one of the <a href=\"http://www.atlargely.com/2008/05/indiana-polls-p.html\">\"nonagenarian hooligans\"</a> kept from her right to vote, was 98 years old) and <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=5950\">vets of multiple foreign wars</a>, not to mention those who simply didn't bother to show up, since they knew they'd not be allowed to vote. All of that following the state of Indiana's own admission in the court case that they were unable to document a single case of voter fraud <em>in the state's history</em> that would have been prevented by their new voter-suppression law.<br> The supporters of such laws, however, argue that it's easy to get one of the free IDs that Indiana offers. Fact is, it's <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=5934\">not easy at all</a>, and those supposedly free IDs can get rather expensive. And the same effort is underway in other states as well.<br> In Missouri, for instance, a state regarded by the McClatchy News Service as <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=4500\">\"Ground Zero\"</a>, in 2006, for the GOP's voter disenfranchisement effort, a man was <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6252\">arrested while legally voting</a> two weeks ago during a state primary election. He was sent to jail because he offered two different pieces of perfectly legal ID, but none that the poll workers at his polling place wanted to accept. That, even after the state's supreme court found draconian photo ID restrictions to be unconstitutional there.<br> In the same state in 2006, not long after the state court's decision, the secretary of state herself (a Democrat), responsible for enforcing the election laws there, was <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=3737\">told three times</a> as she was trying to vote that she needed to present a photo ID. Of course she didn't, and has some familiarities with the law. But that didn't stop them from trying anyway, even as Missouri has some 200,000 voters who could, according to the secretary of state's own numbers, be kept from exercising their legal franchise under such laws.<br> Make no mistake. This is an effort that reaches to the highest federal levels. For example, despite a very clear federal law that requires it - the Bush administration's department of veterans affairs has <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-rieckhoff/brain-dead-bureaucrat-wat_b_119120.html\">disallowed voter registration activities in VA hospitals</a> and other facilities, describing such activities as \"partisan\" (telling, that). Thus, it's assured that many of those who put their very lives on the line under the premise of spreading democracy throughout the world will have no voice in that same democracy back in their own country this year.<br> The beat goes on and will continue to grow louder through Election Day in November. Count on it. The Prospect's Art Levine elegantly and accurately referred to all of this as <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=the_republican_war_on_voting\">The Republican war on voting</a>. But make no mistake about it, this is an all out Republican war on <em>democracy</em> in which we will be witnessing an unprecedented \"troop surge\" between here and November.<br> Paul Weyrich is surely smiling.</p>",
  "<p>MI5 has concluded that there is no easy way to identify those who become involved in terrorism in Britain, according to a classified internal research document on radicalisation seen by the Guardian. </p> <p>The sophisticated analysis, based on hundreds of case studies by the security service, says there is no single pathway to violent extremism.</p> <p>It concludes that it is not possible to draw up a typical profile of the \"British terrorist\" as most are \"demographically unremarkable\" and simply reflect the communities in which they live. </p> <p>The \"restricted\" MI5 report takes apart many of the common stereotypes about those involved in British terrorism. </p> <p>They are mostly British nationals, not illegal immigrants and, far from being Islamist fundamentalists, most are religious novices. Nor, the analysis says, are they \"mad and bad\".<br> Those over 30 are just as likely to have a wife and children as to be loners with no ties, the research shows. </p> <p>The security service also plays down the importance of radical extremist clerics, saying their influence in radicalising British terrorists has moved into the background in recent years. </p> <p>The research, carried out by MI5's behavioural science unit, is based on in-depth case studies on \"several hundred individuals known to be involved in, or closely associated with, violent extremist activity\" ranging from fundraising to planning suicide bombings in Britain.</p> <p>The main findings include: </p> <p>\u0095 The majority are British nationals and the remainder, with a few exceptions, are here legally. Around half were born in the UK, with others migrating here later in life. Some of these fled traumatic experiences and oppressive regimes and claimed UK asylum, but more came to Britain to study or for family or economic reasons and became radicalised many years after arriving.</p> <p>\u0095 Far from being religious zealots, a large number of those involved in terrorism do not practise their faith regularly. Many lack religious literacy and could actually be regarded as religious novices. Very few have been brought up in strongly religious households, and there is a higher than average proportion of converts. Some are involved in drug-taking, drinking alcohol and visiting prostitutes. MI5 says there is evidence that a well-established religious identity actually protects against violent radicalisation. </p> <p>\u0095 The \"mad and bad\" theory to explain why people turn to terrorism does not stand up, with no more evidence of mental illness or pathological personality traits found among British terrorists than is found in the general population.</p> <p>\u0095 British-based terrorists are as ethnically diverse as the UK Muslim population, with individuals from Pakistani, Middle Eastern and Caucasian backgrounds. MI5 says assumptions cannot be made about suspects based on skin colour, ethnic heritage or nationality. </p> <p>\u0095 Most UK terrorists are male, but women also play an important role. Sometimes they are aware of their husbands', brothers' or sons' activities, but do not object or try to stop them.</p> <p>\u0095 While the majority are in their early to mid-20s when they become radicalised, a small but not insignificant minority first become involved in violent extremism at over the age of 30.</p> <p>\u0095 Far from being lone individuals with no ties, the majority of those over 30 have steady relationships, and most have children. MI5 says this challenges the idea that terrorists are young men driven by sexual frustration and lured to \"martyrdom\" by the promise of beautiful virgins waiting for them in paradise. It is wrong to assume that someone with a wife and children is less likely to commit acts of terrorism.</p> <p>\u0095 Those involved in British terrorism are not unintelligent or gullible, and nor are they more likely to be well-educated; their educational achievement ranges from total lack of qualifications to degree-level education. However, they are almost all employed in low-grade jobs.</p> <p>The researchers conclude that the results of their work \"challenge many of the stereotypes that are held about who becomes a terrorist and why\". </p> <p>Crucially, the research has revealed that those who become terrorists \"are a diverse collection of individuals, fitting no single demographic profile, nor do they all follow a typical pathway to violent extremism\".</p> <p>The security service believes the terrorist groups operating in Britain today are different in many important respects both from Islamist extremist activity in other parts of the world and from historical terrorist movements such as the IRA or the Red Army Faction.</p> <p>The \"UK restricted\" MI5 \"operational briefing note\", circulated within the security services in June, warns that, unless they understand the varied backgrounds of those drawn to terrorism in Britain, the security services will fail to counter their activities in the short term and fail to prevent violent radicalisation continuing in the long term.</p> <p>It also concludes that the research results have important lessons for the government's programme to tackle the spread of violent extremism, underlining the need for \"attractive alternatives\" to terrorist involvement but also warning that traditional law enforcement tactics could backfire if handled badly or used against people who are not seen as legitimate targets. </p> <p>The MI5 authors stress that the most pressing current threat is from Islamist extremist groups who justify the use of violence \"in defence of Islam\", but that there are also violent extremists involved in non-Islamist movements. </p> <p>They say that they are concerned with those who use violence or actively support the use of violence and not those who simply hold politically extreme views.</p>",
  "<p>The MI5 briefing note, Understanding Radicalisation and Violent Extremism in the UK, seen by the Guardian provides a unique insight into current thinking within the security service about how a modern-day British terrorist is made.</p> <p>The analysis, based on hundreds of case studies of those involved in or closely associated with terrorism, concludes that there is no single pathway to extremism. All had taken strikingly different journeys to violent extremist activity.</p> <p>However the security service does say that most individuals in the sample had some vulnerability in their background that made them receptive to extremist ideology. </p> <p>For most, radicalisation takes months or years with no one becoming a terrorist overnight, and it is always driven by contact with others. </p> <p>Exposure to extremist ideology, whether in the form of online communities, books, or DVDs, although crucial, is never enough on its own. Personal interaction is essential, in most cases, to draw individuals into violent extremist networks.</p> <h2>Pathways to extremism</h2> <p>The key vulnerabilities identified by MI5 analysts that made those studied receptive to extremist ideology included the experience of migrating to Britain and facing marginalisation and racism; the failure of those with degrees to achieve anything but low-grade jobs; a serious criminal past; travel abroad for up to six months at a time and contact with extremist networks overseas; and religious naivety.</p> <p>The report says that the relationship between criminality and radicalisation is complex, with some criminals attracted by the violent aspects of terrorism, while -others with a criminal past felt genuine regret for their activities. \"Some appeared to have turned to violent extremist groups in the misguided belief that participation in jihad might help atone for previous wrongdoing,\" MI5 says. </p> <p>The report adds that some with a criminal past who have been ostracised from mainstream society find themselves accepted by a radical group. \"We have noticed that terrorist groups are remarkably tolerant of individuals with serious criminal histories. This is the case even when those individuals continue to be involved in very serious non-terrorist crimes, including drug-trafficking, assault and even rape,\" it notes.</p> <p>The psychological impact of these different experiences can be similar \u2014 a perception of threat, insecurity, uncertainty or dislocation. The feeling can be triggered by personal or vicarious experiences of inequality, marginalisation, or victimisation, particularly racial or religious attacks, both physical and verbal.</p> <p>\"This feeling is heightened by mainstream UK media coverage that perpetuates negative stereotypes of Muslims, by Islamic and non-Islamic media that reports atrocities against Muslims worldwide, and by the extremist groups themselves who spread the message that Muslims are being \u2026 persecuted, to the point that the only course of action is to fight back with violence.\"</p> <h2>Radicalising influences</h2> <p>MI5 says it is important not to commit the \"logical fallacy\" of assuming that all those who share a common experience of dislocating episodes will become terrorists. \"What is different about those who ended up involved in terrorism is that they came into contact with existing extremists who recognised their vulnerabilities (and their usefulness to the extremist group).\"</p> <p>The report says that in the past radical clerics featured in this role but \"their influence has moved into the background\". Their speeches and writings are still important in facilitating radicalisation but more often now charismatic individuals from local communities and their own peers offer potential recruits guidance and act as role models.</p> <p>The security service says it is important to recognise the role of online communities: \"People do not generally become radicalised simply through passive browsing of extremist websites, but many such sites create opportunities for the 'virtual' social interaction that drives radicalisation in the virtual world. Books, DVDs, pamphlets and music all feature in the experiences of British terrorists but their emotional content \u2014 eg images of atrocities against Muslims \u2014 is often more important than their factual content.\"</p> <p>Once involved in an extremist network, powerful social psychological processes bind the individual to the group, including the emotional rewards of belonging. \"Membership of a terrorist group can provide a sense of meaning and purpose. It can lead to enhanced self-esteem, and the individual can feel a sense of control and influence over their lives \u2026 some may find psychological security in a belief in future rewards (both in paradise and in the collective memory of the movement) following suicide operations.\"</p> <p>The analysis suggests that for dislocated individuals the terrorist group can become \"fictive kin\", replacing lost ties to family or community. Isolating new or potential recruits through overseas travel, training camps and time spent online helps to encourage them to regard violence as an acceptable form of action.</p> <h2>Promoting disengagement from terrorism</h2> <p>MI5 admits there is no substantial research on disengagement from Islamist terrorism because it is a relatively new phenomenon but the historic record of terrorist groups illustrates that individuals do leave such networks. Individuals may develop negative feelings through personality clashes or may become disillusioned with the aims and tactics of the group. The 1987 Enniskillen bombing led to disillusion among some IRA sympathisers. Despite the \"rewards\" of martyrdom, individuals may still fear death or be apprehensive about \"failing\" in an attack and spending many years in prison.<br>A change in priorities such as the birth of a child, or a new relationship or job may take priority over terrorism.</p> <p>MI5 says this last theme provides one way of preventing radicalisation. \"Although it is popular to assume that -people who become terrorists are passively 'brainwashed' into extremism, individuals in fact make active choices to become and remain in extremist activity.\"</p> <p>No single measure will reduce radicalisation, it says, but a package targeted at vulnerable groups could include providing fulfilling jobs for young people, better integration of immigrants, effective reintegration of ex-prisoners and the provision of alternatives to the extremist pathway out of \"ordinary\" criminality.</p> <p>Law enforcement to disrupt existing networks remains vitally important, MI5 says, but the impact of those who unwittingly exacerbate the perception of threat and marginalisation must not be neglected. \"Sections of the media, our own and allies' governments can sometimes make statements that are unwittingly or deliberately provocative. Non-Muslim groups (eg rightwing extremists) can also stoke false fears and resentments, which can heighten the perception of threat in Muslim communities,\" the report says.</p>",
  "<p>Being caught committing a drugs offence here in Beijing is an 825\u20131 shot. Odds like those surprise even the International Olympic Committee.</p> <p>The head of its medical commission, Professor Arne Ljungqvist, said a week ago that the three positive tests from 2,203 returned at that time was a \"quite low\" figure because \"usually we have dozens\". Since then the number of doping controls conducted has almost doubled to 4,133 but there have still only been two more positive tests. With the athletes at these Olympics going stronger, higher, faster across the board, should we be suspicious? </p> <p>Victor Conte certainly thinks so. The man who, as the founder of Balco, was the architect of the biggest athletics drugs scam in history \u2014 or at least the biggest ever to be exposed \u2014 said on Monday that he believes the anti-doping culture of some National Olympic Committees and teams leaves much to be desired.</p> <p>\"When [race] times begin falling like rain, questions arise, especially when the record-setters are from countries such as Jamaica and other Caribbean nations where there is no independent anti-doping federation,\" he wrote in a letter to the New York Daily News.</p> <p>Some teams definitely have form. The entire weightlifting team of Greece was banned from these Olympics after 11 of its 14 members tested positive for steroids in March.</p> <p>So even at odds of 825\u20131 we should not perhaps be too taken aback that the biggest name to have been caught doping is Fani Halkia, winner of the 400m hurdles for Greece in Athens. The former Olympic champion's story fits Conte's description well: having come back from retirement to lower her personal best by 1.22sec in the 2004 semi-finals, she won gold by a half-second margin. The IOC has now engaged lawyers to prosecute her coach, George Panagiotopoulos, another of whose athletes has also recently tested positive for steroids.</p> <p>The strangest thing is that three of Beijing's four other drugs cheats did not test positive for an even vaguely sophisticated substance. A North Korean double medallist in shooting used beta-blockers; a Vietnamese gymnast had taken medication used to control PMT; and the cyclist Mar\u00eda Isabel Moreno flew home to Spain as soon as she had provided her specimen, knowing how soon the IOC would turn up the EPO in her system. It seems an almost contemptuous lack of competence in the field of sporting deception.</p> <p>It is not yet known for what Lyudmila Blonska, the latest to fall foul of the procedures, has been caught. But these Games' heptathlon silver medallist is a repeat offender who served a two-year ban for using the proscribed steroid stanozolol in 2003. Her silver-medal performance at the world championships last year aroused the suspicions of Kelly Sotherton \u2014 the Briton had finished third behind Blonska.</p> <p>The IOC, though, points to its low hit rate with a cheerful smile. \"I think quite many recent events have shown that we are rather on the heels of those who try to cheat,\" said Ljungqvist last week. \"The situation has been improved. <br>\"My interpretation is that it is a feature in the increased awareness in the sports population that doping is unaccepted, [it is] unacceptable to compete in the Games if you dope yourselves. I feel that the figures are encouraging rather than anything else.\"</p> <p>Ljungqvist's organisation obviously has the most to lose with every positive test, and others might say the evidence suggests that the cheats are staying one step ahead of the system. Quite apart from the incompetence of the officials conducting the procedures \u2014 the bruises on Chris Hoy's arms as he won his third gold medal on Tuesday show how unfamiliar they are with the cartography of veins \u2014 observers have a right to wonder why there have been no positives for the latest designer drug, slow-release EPO.</p> <p>The IOC says it is employing a reliable test for the third-generation version of the drug after its detection was trialled at this year's Tour de France. But here is another statistic: the 2008 Tour also threw up five positive tests, a race in which there were fewer than 200 riders as against more than 10,000 athletes in the Olympic village. Does that add up?</p>",
  "<p>I never felt particularly American until I moved to London in January. This is ironic, because I spent most of my youth longing to escape my family's conservative roots and often looked to Europe as the place to be \u2013 a bastion of progressivism, with its expansive welfare systems and low drinking age to boot. So when I found out I was moving last fall, I felt as though I were fulfilling my destiny, and promptly proceeded to brag to my friends about all the healthcare and childcare benefits I would be receiving as a resident of the United Kingdom.</p> <p>This was all well and good until I landed in London and realised I didn't believe any of it. I loved the idea of universal healthcare and paid maternity leave, but I was from America, where the word \"socialism\" doesn't exist and only the French pay taxes. As a progressive, I wanted to believe that these things were possible, but as an American, I was completely cynical, certain these things were too good to be true.</p> <p>So it was with great scepticism that, shortly after arriving, I started researching nursery schools for my soon-to-be three-year old daughter. I had read that every three- and four-year old was entitled to 12.5 hours of free nursery education, and that this grant could be used at either public or private schools. Because their hours fit my schedule better, I began looking into the latter. All told, I toured three schools, and at the end of each tour, I essentially demanded the bad news. \"So about the national education grant,\" I'd say, expecting to hear about all the paperwork and things I couldn't possibly understand. And yet in every case, the answer was the same: A nonchalant wave of the hand followed by: \"Oh, yeah, we handle that. At the end of each term, we'll hand you a rebate check.\"</p> <p>Turns out, they were right. In a few weeks, my daughter will begin nursery with the help of a generous government grant \u2013 a privilege she wouldn't have in the US, where children begin public education when they are five.</p> <p>With the US presidential race gearing up for the fall, I am continually amazed at how little support or even attention is paid to social services \u2013 from welfare to maternity leave \u2013 that are standard issue in almost every other developed country, but essentially non existent in America. National Geographic recently surveyed 168 countries and found that America was one of only five countries that <a href=\"http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/family/archives/118922.asp\">did not give mothers any paid maternity leave</a> \u2013 right up there with Swaziland, Papua New Guinea and Lesotho. </p> <p>When I think about why this may be, I can't help but think about my own reaction toward these issues upon moving to London and all the subtle ways that growing up in America inspired this dismissive attitude. As I thought about it, I realised that this particular brand of American cynicism isn't just about red tape, or high costs or giving up oversight, but about the feeling that when you're white and fairly well off in America, such benefits are beneath you.</p> <p>As shameful as it is, this is a hard feeling to shake \u2013 even for a die-hard progressive like me. This point was made readily clear to me during a conversation I recently had with a secretary at a nearby public school. It's a much-revered school among the upper middle classes of North London, with great reviews from parents and educators. For this reason, it's very selective. The closer you live to the school, the better chance you have of getting in, the secretary explained. To illustrate her point, she gestured behind her. \"Sometimes,\" she said, \"we just take that building.\" My mouth dropped for two reasons \u2013 one, because I knew I couldn't afford the houses in the area, and two, because behind her stood one of the more imposing housing projects I had ever seen. Further research showed that 67% of this highly sought-after school are minorities.</p> <p>Although I in no way believe this is representative of schools throughout London, where there are certainly plenty of badly performing schools in poor, minority rich areas, I can safely say that I cannot imagine this conversation having taken place in America. </p> <p>When I think back through my childhood and to today, I realise that in the US, programmes that support general welfare policies are almost always cast in a negative light, one with disgraceful racial and class hues. One of the more famous examples of this came in 1976, one year before I was born, when then presidential candidate Ronald Reagan routinely wooed the support of white Americans by evoking the image of an unidentified, thieving \"welfare queen\" from Chicago's South Side, a well-known black neighbourhood:</p> <p>\"She has 80 names, 30 addresses, 12 Social Security cards and is collecting veteran's benefits on four non-existing deceased husbands. And she is collecting Social Security on her cards. She's got Medicaid, getting food stamps and she is collecting welfare under each of her names.\" </p> <p>Such benefits badmouthing is not limited to conservatives. In 1996, Bill Clinton signed the Welfare Reform Bill, which demolished the last remaining safety net for poor people in America, by instituting strict work requirements and placing five-year limits on benefits. When he signed the bill, he was surrounded by a number of white male lawmakers and three women \u2013 two of them black, one of them quite overweight, Reagan's welfare queen all over again. As Americans bid adieu to one of its last compassionate policies, this was <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/history/welref.html\">the image</a> in our minds.</p> <p>Given the dismal state of healthcare in America, I am hopeful that Americans are finally willing to see past these divisive messages and realise that government-sponsored programmes can benefit everyone. It would be a huge step in the right direction. But the outlook is mixed. The public seems <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/03/01/opinion/polls/main2528357.shtml\">ready for change</a> on this issue, and yet even Barack Obama still feels the need to support things like <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/us/politics/02campaigncnd.html?scp=1&amp;sq=\" obama,\" faith based&amp;st=\"cse&quot;\">faith-based initiatives</a> that essentially downgrade social programmes into the realm of charity. But it is only when Americans stop seeing these things as gifts and not the <em>right</em> of every individual that change can happen. </p> <p>That may be the biggest difference I've noted since moving to London \u2013 people here, as far as I can tell, see things like healthcare, paid maternity leave and childcare grants as a given. And when they feel the benefits are not good enough, they complain. A lot! More importantly, everyone seems to do it. It's not just poor people or minorities. And I have to admit, it's a pretty addictive viewpoint. Despite my rocky beginning, now, eight months in, and with my daughter off to nursery and healthcare no longer a constant worry, I can confidently say, it feels good to be European.</p>",
  "<p>The Competition Commission today signalled the break up of BAA when it called for the company to be forced to sell off three of its seven airports, including two in London.</p> <p>In a provisional report the commission said it had found competition problems at all seven of BAA's airports, adding that these could best be tackled by the sale of two from Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted as well as either Glasgow or Edinburgh.</p> <p>Though the commission put much of the blame for the competition problems on BAA's common ownership of the seven airports, which include Southampton and Aberdeen, it said the regulatory regime needed to be modernised and called on the government to review its 2003 white paper on airports and air travel in the light of its proposed ownership changes.</p> <p>BAA, which was bought by a consortium led by the Spanish group Ferrovial for \u00a310bn two years ago, attacked some of the commission's analysis as flawed and said the proposed remedies were \"disproportionate and counter productive\".</p> <p>Colin Matthews, BAA's chief executive, said: \"Just as the government is about to make the decisions that could lead to the first full length runways being built in the south-east since the second world war, the commission risks creating uncertainty, delay and confusion at exactly the wrong time.\"</p> <p>Trade unions representing airport workers expressed concern about the commission's proposals. Unite national secretary, Steve Turner, said: \"Any attempt to break up BAA will be resisted. This union and our members will not sit back while the market plays games with their jobs and their terms and conditions of employment.\"</p> <p>Response from airlines was mixed. Ryanair's director of legal and regulatory affairs, Jim Callaghan, said the low-cost carrier was fully behind the report's conclusions. \"Competition works; monopolies don't. BAA's monopoly control over the London airports has been highly detrimental to competition and consumers. BAA has long ignored the needs of its airline users and the travelling public and provided inefficient ... facilities, encouraged by an ineffectual regulator, the CAA.\" </p> <p>Others were more cautious. EasyJet chief executive, Andy Harrison, praised the report as honest and unbiased. \"They have said what everyone knows, that our airports aren't working, and that BAA and regulation aren't working.\" However he added: \"Let's not kid ourselves into thinking that the break-up of BAA will automatically result in a better deal for the travelling public. Simply selling a monopoly airport from one greedy, highly indebted capitalist to another will benefit no one apart from the dealmakers in the City.\" </p> <p>British Airways's response concentrated on regulation rather than ownership. \"The focus must be on ensuring that the current regulation of BAA's London airports is strengthened.\"</p> <p>In its 289-page report, the commission said that when the government had privatised BAA in 1987 a key objective in keeping it intact had been to ensure the provision of adequate airport capacity to meet an expected growth in demand.</p> <p>\"More than 20 years later, there is inadequate capacity, particularly runway capacity, in the south-east. Not only is this expected to continue until at least 2015, but there is as yet no certainty on the implementation of plans for additional runway capacity at either Stansted or Heathrow.\"</p> <p>Christopher Clarke, chairman of the BAA Airport inquiry group which produced today's report, said that while the planning regime and government policy had had an impact on the development of new runway capacity, BAA should have been pressing for the government to move more quickly</p> <p>\"You would expect the owner and operator ... to want to push the government.\"</p> <p>BAA's Matthews said criticising the company for not delivering new capacity was \"like criticising British Energy for not building new nuclear power stations in the 1990s. Politically it was not going to happen\".</p> <p>Clarke said the government's white paper had been a \"very important step forward\" but added that it had had a number of unintended consequences. The commission is concerned these could include a risk of further delays to the expansion of Stansted and Heathrow and prevent airports from reacting flexibly to market developments.</p> <p>In response the Department for Transport said it would examine the report in detail. However it noted: \"Government policy has to take account of a range of issues, in addition to competition and market issues. The white paper provides a strategic framework for developments in aviation and to allow those with an interest to plan ahead. It rejected a 'predict and provide' or market led approach and instead set out a sustainable framework which takes account of the need for growth and local social and environmental considerations.\"</p> <p>Clarke acknowledged that the provisional findings were not \"set in stone\", but he added that they were the result of very detailed analysis, suggesting it would take a dramatic development to significantly change the thrust of the report. </p> <p>He added that the commission expected to publish its final report by the first quarter of next year. Asked about how long the commission would give BAA to sell airports if that was the final conclusion, Clarke said it could be done within around six months. \"We are talking about the course of 2009.\"</p>",
  "<p>ArcelorMittal, the world's biggest steel group, splashed out $810m (\u00a3435m) today for the Brazilian iron ore business of London Mining.</p> <p>The group created by Lakshmi Mittal is paying 50% more than London Mining's market value for the Brazilian business alone as it seeks to boost its self-sufficiency in raw materials to as much as 85% by 2014-15.</p> <p>The cash-rich ArcelorMittal has said it plans to increase its iron ore production to 110m tonnes by 2012 or virtually double the 60m tonnes it produced on its own account in 2007. It said it would consider investing up to $700m to raise output at London Mining's Brazilian mines to more than 10m tonnes a year from its current output of 1.4m tonnes. </p> <p>The mines, based in the state of Minais Gerais, about 40 miles from Belo Horizonte, are being expanded to increase output to 3.2m tonnes next year. ArcelorMittal has embarked on a huge growth strategy, which is partly designed to offset the soaring cost of raw materials caused by surging demand in emerging markets such as China and India.</p> <p>The group spent $5.1bn in the second quarter alone on acquisitions, including on coal mines in West Virginia, USA, in Australia, India, Russia and South Africa. It is also expanding its coal and ore interests in other parts of Africa such as Liberia.</p> <p>This is part of a three-part growth strategy, which includes acquisitions of steelmakers in countries such as China, India and Turkey, and expansion of existing businesses by adding products.</p> <p>ArcelorMittal is also known to be courting another Brazilian iron ore business called Namisa, which is being sold by CSN. Today's deal also sees it take partial control of an iron ore port facility being built in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</p> <p>Aditya Mittal, chief financial officer, said the London Mining acquisition would help ensure that \"our iron ore base is further diversified in the face of tighter supply for raw materials.\"</p> <p>On July 30 the group reported a 31% jump in first-half sales to $67.6bn, with operating earnings up 35% to $13.1bn. It said third-quarter operating earnings would exceed $8.5bn and its capital spending would reach $7bn for the year. </p>",

  "<p>I don't normally make it through to Richard Kay's society column in the Daily Mail, but I did today and I learnt something new: <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1047119/Two-Jags-wont-leap-Lords.html\">John Prescott won't take a seat in the House of Lords</a>.</p> <p>Why is that interesting? Only because it was widely assumed that he would take a peerage. </p> <p>As anyone who dealt with him during his 10-year stint as deputy PM will tell you, Prescott always had a very acute sense of status, bordering on obsession. And (although I haven't got a copy to hand, so I can't check the exact quote), in his autobiography Prezza he certainly did not rule out elevation to the upper house.</p> <p>But now he has. This is what he told Kay, or at least one of Kay's minions:</p> <blockquote> <p>I don't want to be a member of the House of Lords. I will not accept it. My wife Pauline would quite like me to accept it, but why should I be sidelined to the Lords when I could do so much more for the Labour movement?</p> <p>\"Being a lord is not for three years or four years, it is for life. There are other things I want to get involved in. People think already that I have retired from public life - I haven't. I am still an MP and after that I still want to make a contribution.</p> </blockquote> <p>Good.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Philadelphia.<br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Adam Granduciel (vocals, sparkle vibrato guitar, harmonica, samplers, organs), Kurt Vile (Les Paul chime generator, rodeo 6-string slinger), Kyle Lloyd (drums, percussion), Charlie Hall (drums, organ), Dave Hartley (bass, guitars).</p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> Talking of band names, good and bad, <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/music/2008/08/name.html\">which we have been this week</a>, here's a great one. Like Black Kids, The War On Drugs have a superb, memorable, attention-grabbing name that says nothing and everything about what they do. It has contemporary resonance while also placing the Philly five-piece in a continuum of American outsider-gang bands. And although none of their songs appear to address narcotics or the problems they create, there is a blend going on here of rootsy traditionalism and modern instrumental experimentation - with a militant urgency - that makes the War On Drugs the perfect moniker.</p> <p>The wheezing harmonica and rat-a-tat drums, the needling guitars, swirling organ and nasal drone - we've heard these before a couple of times. The War On Drugs are certainly rooted in the 60s and 70s, and obviously comparable to Dylan and Springsteen with their linear narratives and tumble of imagistic language. But the blur of guitar-bass-drums is given a sort of space-rock sheen, a production shimmer, as though My Bloody Valentine or Brian Eno have been messing with the studio controls.</p> <p>One of their standout tracks, Arms Like Boulders, hears Granduciel spewing out a torrent of oblique invective, all second-person accusations (\"Chasin' squirrels around your property / Makin' sure that they know that this is your kingdom\"). There are vivid references to Turkish carpets, circuses and hiding your eyes from the sun that is pure 1966 Dylan - the band make like The Band chasing \"that wild mercury sound\" - presumably achieved in part by the singer's sparkle vibrato guitar and Kurt Vile's chime generator.</p> <p>With keyboards stabbing out two chords and drums like distant detonations, A Needle In Your Eye #16 is at once authentic and ethereal. It has a locomotive relentlessness and echoing epicness that recalls Springsteen at his most Spectoresque, but armed with a battery of shoegazey FX. Meanwhile, the singer has about him the urgent air of someone telling a story or reporting some news that is quite momentous. Although some of the lyrics are hackneyed - Granduciel should have removed the monkey from his back - the overall effect is impressive. Equally richly cinematic is Taking the Farm, like Dylan being dragged into the 21st century by Dave Fridmann without compromising his vision for the sake of contemporaneity. The War On Drugs' concerns are apparently ecological and occasionally political but their appeal is universal, or at least it will be if you inhabit a world where an attention to guitar sounds and words holds steady. </p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"The influences are obvious, but this is still rousing road-rock.\" <br> <strong>The truth:</strong> The influences might be obvious, but it's the way they combine them, the connections they make between seemingly disparate sources, that raises this beyond the level of historicity and homage. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Make The E Street Band consider collaborating with Sonic Boom or Kevin Shields. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Form a spin-off project called The War On Terror. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Wagonwheel Blues is out now on Secretly Canadian.<br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Arcade Fire, Wilco, The Waterboys, Hold Steady.<br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.thewarondrugs.net/\">TheWarOnDrugs.net</a> ; <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/thewarondrugs\">MySpace.com/thewarondrugs</a> ; <a href=\"http://www.secretlycanadian.com/artist.php?name=warondrugs\">SecretlyCanadian.com</a><br> <strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Master Shortie.</p>",

At the last radio contact, the plane was at 17,000ft and travelling at an unusually slow 119 knots.</p> <p>A park ranger and other pilots flying nearby reported seeing the aircraft plunge into the water. Investigators found poor maintenance had caused crucial parts to become excessively worn. </p> <p>In August 2005, engine failure caused a West Caribbean Airways MD-82 to crash into mountains near the Colombia-Venezuela border, killing all 160 passengers and crew. </p> <p>The crew of the passenger flight, from Panama City to Martinique, reported trouble with one engine to Venezuelan air traffic control and diverted to Caracas. Shortly afterwards, they reported that the second engine had gone. </p> <p>A domestic flight from Bangkok crashed on landing in Phuket, Thailand, in September 2007, killing 88 of the 130 people aboard the One-Two-GO by Orient Thai MD-82. </p> <p>As the crew attempted a second go-around in adverse weather, the plane was unable to climb, fell back on to the runway and broke up, with the burning wreckage coming to rest in the grass. </p> <p>Two months later, all 57 passengers and crew died when an Atlasjet Airlines MD-83 on a Turkish domestic flight crashed into mountains near Isparta. </p> <p>The plane broke into two, and the wings and engine were found on top of a hill with the fuselage 500ft down the slope. </p> <p>In March and April this year, American Airlines cancelled thousands of flights after a safety audit raised questions over the safety of hydraulic wiring in MD-80s. </p> <p>No aircraft were grounded, but each inspection took several hours, making cancellations necessary. </p> <p>American Airlines has the largest number of MD-80s - 300 of its 655-strong fleet.

A British police officer sent to escort him back to the UK admitted he had no legal jurisdiction and could only look on during yesterday's developments.</p> <p>Gadd was jailed in the UK in 1999 for downloading child pornography. On release he moved to Spain and Cuba before going to south-east Asia.<br>Cambodia expelled him over alleged sex crimes and he went to the Vietnamese coastal resort of Vung Tau, where he lay low until his presence was uncovered in 2005 by British tabloid newspapers.</p> <p>The two girls he was eventually convicted of abusing initially said he had raped them \u2014 a crime which carries the death penalty \u2014 but were reportedly paid off.

  "<p>Suppose you are an observant but not particularly devout American Catholic. You go to Mass on Sundays and those holy days that you remember. You don't eat meat on Lenten Fridays - though how you curse it. You feel guilty about not going to confession more often. You fish money out of your pockets during most offerings and usually give to the bishop's appeal.</p> <p>Your faith may not move mountains, but it's real, and you take the obligations of your religion seriously. While you're not wild about all the particulars of Church teaching, you don't doubt that it's true. How will you vote in this election? How should you vote?</p> <p>Demographically, the first answer is easy. If you're a regular Mass-attending Catholic, you're <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2004-06-02-religion-gap_x.htm\">highly likely to vote for the generic Republican candidate</a> for Congress and president. Catholics are a sliver to the left of Republicans on fiscal issues, but abortion seals the deal.</p> <p>Why? Because there is the sense among the faithful that, at a minimum, one's vote should not increase the odds of one winding up in hell. The Democrats are the party of abortion-on-demand, and the Church teaches that abortion is a grievous sin. Best not to take any chances.</p> <p>Catholic liberals have tried to challenge this assumption, without much success. Social justice issues are said to be as important as abortion. \"How can the Church work so hard to protect the unborn but care so little about government provision for the born?\" sputters one familiar straw man.</p> <p>Or <a href=\"http://www.catholic.org/politics/story.php?id=28726\">\"prudential judgment\"</a> is trotted out to explain why it's OK to vote for politicians who are \"personally opposed\" to abortion but want to keep it widely available, and maybe even publicly funded.</p> <p>Most Mass-going Catholics don't buy it. They're apt to agree with the prudential judgment of groups like the fraternal organisation the <a href=\"http://www.kofc.org/\">Knights of Columbus</a>. At their annual convention this year, the Knights didn't just condemn abortion generically but <a href=\"http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=13693\">called out fellow Catholic politicians</a> who support a practice the Church calls clear grounds for excommunication.</p> <p>The Church believes in a hierarchy of evil, which has stark political implications. It means that certain issues are intrinsically more important than others. So long as it's legal and widely available in the US, abortion will always trump social justice issues, even if the other issues might be worthy causes.</p> <p>But is there an issue that abortion might not be able to trump? Yes there is, and it could spell doom for the Republicans.</p> <p>The issue that could trip up the GOP is war. The Vatican doesn't preach pacifism, but it does expect nations to observe the principles of just war that were developed by doctors of the Church and partially incorporated into international law.</p> <p>Before one nation goes to war with another, it must have a clear and legitimate cause. Absent the threat of imminent attack, it must first seek to resolve the conflict in a way that avoids bloodshed. America took <a href=\"http://www.reason.com/news/show/32570.html\">great pains to observe just war principles in Afghanistan</a> and then inexplicably threw them out some state department window in Iraq.</p> <p>The Pope and his predecessor warned against this. John Paul II sent Cardinal Pio Laghi as an emissary to the White House who <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-03-05-bush-catholic_x.htm\">explained that the US invasion of Iraq would be \"illegal\" and \"unjust\"</a>. Benedict XVI, then head of the teaching office of the Church, <a href=\"http://blog.nj.com/ledgerarchives/2008/03/for_pope_and_president_a_chasm.html\">said</a> that the \"concept of a 'preventive war' does not appear in the Catechism of the Catholic Church\", with good reason.</p> <p>Moreover, the presidential primaries produced candidates that make this election difficult for chagrined churchgoers, because they only amplify the worst tendencies of their respective parties.</p> <p>Senator Barack Obama has voted against affording protections even to premature babies that are accidentally delivered during abortions, for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/08/uselections2008.barackobama\">fear that it might set a precedent</a> that could prevent even one partial-birth abortion at some point.</p> <p>Senator John McCain championed an unjust war in Iraq during his first run for president, was its biggest cheerleader in Congress, <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/news/archives/2007/04/20/bomb_bomb_bomb_bomb_bomb_iran.html\">sings songs about bombing other countries</a> and has adopted a belligerent posture toward much of the rest of the world. More unjust wars would be almost guaranteed on his watch.</p> <p>With <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYCMxD4pylM\">apologies to The Simpsons</a>, that makes this an election of abortions for some, small unjust wars for others. For Catholics who take Church teaching seriously, that's no choice at all.</p>",
  "<p>Sudan's president today denied his regime was involved in genocide in Darfur as he made his first trip abroad since the international criminal court moved to indict him for war crimes. </p> <p>Speaking in Turkey, Omar al-Bashir, said: \"Genocide like the International Criminal Court claims is non-existent\" and claimed the death toll in the indictment of 300,000 black Africans since 2003 was inflated. </p> <p>\"If [those figures] were accurate, there needs to mass graves.

Bashir is accused of directing the Janjaweed militia against black African groups and civilians. </p> <p>Sudan's government denies any ties with the Janjaweed militia with Bashir labelling them \"thieves and gangsters\". The government does, however, admit to mobilising \"self-defence militias\" in order to control rebel attacks. <br> The Sudan People's Liberation Movement \u2013 a former rebel group now in a unity government with Bashir - has urged the president to hand over certain Sudanese officials as concessions to push away the court's allegations. Bashir, however, asserts that his administration does not recognise the court. There are further fears that the recent condemnation from the ICC could put pressure on the delicate 2005 peace deal in Sudan and lead the country back into civil war. Bashir claims that this is the objective of western governments who want greater access to Sudan's resources. \"Some forces who are targeting Sudan's resources are encouraging fighting in Sudan and want her to be divided,\" he said today.  In Istanbul, al-Bashir offered hope that the violence in Darfur will end, promising Sudan's first ever free and democratic elections for next year.  </p>",
  "<p>On any given Sunday, about 5,000 kids come into the children's ministry at Prestonwood Baptist church in Plano, Texas.</p> <p>Families form lines and check in at 32 kiosks spread among the church's six entrances, swiping Quick Passes at the self-service machines. Parents register the kids for classes, then a kiosk spits out sticky name badges for both parent and child with identifying information: child's and parent's names, classroom and any food allergies.</p> <p>About a dozen of the kiosks have volunteers standing by to help families who have forgotten their digitised cards.</p> <p>Badges in hand, parents walk their kids to one of 85 classrooms for a Bible-focused story hour, playtime or worship before they themselves head off for services in Prestonwood's main sanctuary.</p> <p>\"This was essential to us,\" Prestonwood executive pastor Mike Buster said of the technology to ensure children's safety. </p> <p>\"Volunteers are at every entrance making sure everyone has a badge.\"</p> <p>Prestonwood relies on special computer software designed for churches to keep track of who is where - not just which children should go home with which parents.</p> <p>Beyond keeping kids safe, congregants get a virtual town square where they can go online to request counselling on a variety of spiritual and personal matters or sign up their children for Bible study or sports leagues.</p> <p>Buster said the software helps church leaders retain a sort of intimacy among the 27,000-member congregation.</p> <p>\"We want to make Prestonwood not feel like a big church but a small town,\" he said.</p> <p>To build its ecclesiastical nerve centre, the church turned to Fellowship Technologies.</p> <p>The Irving, Texas, firm grew out of tech efforts at a church in Grapevine, Texas, in 2004 and has bloomed into a data and software company catering to 870 churches in 46 states and eight countries.</p> <p>Using the internet, Fellowship Tech helps churches digitise operations just like a secular business would - from wristbands for children in day care (think hospitals) to tracking which members stop attending (try dropping your cable service) to monitoring tithing levels (just as the American Cancer Society might contact someone who stopped giving).</p> <p>LifeChurch.tv of Edmond, Oklahoma, is another Fellowship Technologies customer.</p> <p>The church ministers to 19,000 people through 12 campuses and the internet. With such a far-flung congregation, it's vital to keep track of new members by archiving the cards they fill out detailing interests and contact information.</p> <p>\"It keeps people from slipping through the cracks,\" said Suzy Crisswell, systems administrator for the 12-year-old church. \"They will get a phone call, saying ... 'Thanks for visiting.' It makes people feel important and wanted.\"</p> <p>For users, Fellowship Tech's software helps lessen the perception that members often become anonymous in megachurches.</p> <p>\"Big churches can do big things,\" points out Jeff Pelletier, the company's vice-president for sales and marketing. Churches \"can use technology to care for you even better\".</p> <p>Churches of all sizes became digitised as the general business world did in the last 25 years. But megachurches - those with more than 2,000 members - are an especially fruitful market.</p> <p>And megachurches really began to grow in the last 20 years, according to Megachurches Today, a report released in 2005 by the Hartford Institute for Religion Research in Hartford, Connecticut.</p> <p>What would become Fellowship Tech got its start in 1999, when Fellowship Church developed a program to meet its own technology needs.</p> <p>By 2003, the church decided to spin off the program and called on then-member Jeff Hook, a former executive at Farmers Branch, Texas-based i2 Technologies Inc, to help.</p> <p>Raising $2.5m from outside investors, he became the newly minted company's chief executive.</p> <p>The company's Web-based program gives churches an interactive administrative system rather than serving as just a repository of \"one-way information\", Pelletier said.</p> <p>Churches have long had some administrative functions. In the past, they could be handled by ledgers and contribution statements, said Phill Martin, deputy chief executive of the National Association of Church Business Administration in Richardson, Texas.</p> <p>But in the 52 years since his organisation's founding, Martin said, churches have had to become more businesslike. With budgets in the tens of millions, many churches now employ administrators.</p> <p>Despite growing up as a preacher's kid, Hook said, he initially didn't want to take on the Fellowship Tech project: \"I was interested in the million-dollar deal, not selling software to churches.\"</p> <p>But the 49-year-old said he felt guided by God to pursue the venture.</p> <p>\"My mind opened in, like, 24 different ways\" with ideas on how to use technology to benefit other churches, he said. Hook has found mixing religion and business can sometimes be tricky.</p> <p>Should his company sell to churches that don't conform to traditional tenets? \"Some have a limited view of Christianity,\" he said. But \"I'm no holy roller\".</p> <p>When a company sales rep objected to selling the software to a gay church, Hook stepped in to make the sale.<br>He said he understands why the rep was uncomfortable, but \"I'm not going to set myself up as God\".</p> <p>In some ways, it seems the company's Christian values transcend religious doctrine. \"We hired a Sikh employee who loves it here,\" Hook said.</p> <p>The ability to balance religion and business has helped the company succeed.</p> <p>Looking to hire additional programmers, Hook has asked the Sikh employee for recommendations. \"I told him, 'They don't have to be Christian, but they do need to be good programmers.'\"</p>",
  "<p><br>Grey area ... Sir Ian McKellen's Gandalf could be the hero of The Hobbit II</p> <p>It's the conundrum faced by every manager at one point or another: do you delegate an important duty to an employee, who may well mess it up, or do you face up to the fact that you'd be far better off just doing it yourself?</p> <p>Two of the greatest film-makers around at the moment, Peter Jackson and Guillermo Del Toro, have been mulling over just that for the past eight months, during their search for a scribe to take on the challenge of translating JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings prequel, The Hobbit, into a pair of perfectly-formed screenplays. Their conclusion? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/20/lordoftherings.thehobbit\">The only people they trust to do the job properly are themselves</a>.</p> <p>When the rumours of Del Toro's involvement in The Hobbit began to emerge in January, nobody really thought to ask who would be penning the thing. The Mexican commonly directs from his own screenplay, and Jackson's longstanding creative team of Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, who worked with him on Rings, would presumably be retained. It turns out both these scenarios were by no means a foregone conclusion.</p> <p>The official line behind the decision announced today is that Del Toro and Jackson found themselves so deeply involved in Tolkien's earlier story, which details the adventures of hobbit Bilbo Baggins as he joins Gandalf and a group of dwarves in a quest to slay a dragon, that they simply couldn't bring themselves to farm it out. They also realised that their schedules were less packed than previously thought, and were faced with a tight time period within which to get the films into cinemas.</p> <p>I suspect all of the above are true. But I'm going to speculate that another factor was behind the move. Jackson has promised his newly bosom buddies at New Line not one, but <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/film/2008/02/what_on_middle_earth_will_the.html\">two films based on The Hobbit</a>. And herein lies the issue: there is only one Hobbit book. Tolkien's sequel was The Lord of the Rings: he never saw fit to fill in the 80-year period between the end of the first tome and the start of the second, other than through notes and sections of the appendices to The Lord of the Rings.</p> <p>Del Toro, on the other hand, recently went on record stating that he will only film a second film if there is a second film to film, so to speak. \"We believe there is a second movie,\" <a href=\"http://defamer.com/397317/guillermo-del-toro-would-sooner-burn-down-hollywood-than-make-second-hobbit-film\">he told reporters at the Los Angeles film festival in June</a>. \"If there isn't, there will not be. If we find it, we will shoot it, but by God, if we do not find it, we will not shoot it. I am anxious to shoot the book, and I'm willing and able to dedicate myself to shooting the [second film].\"</p> <p>He's got a point. There are a number of stories which might form the basis of the second film. It could focus on Gandalf's mission to expel Sauron, known in The Hobbit as The Necromancer, from his tower in the evil forest of Mirkwood - Sir Ian McKellen has confirmed he will be involved, and would make a powerful central protagonist. Alternately it could centre on Aragon's years helping the Stewards of Gondor in their battles with the evil Corsairs of Umbar and other dark forces. Perhaps both might be included. Either way, these stories will require significant padding if they are to form the basis of an entire standalone movie. Might there be some dispute between Del Toro and Jackson over whether a second movie is doable? And might Jackson's decision to become closely involved with the screenplay stem from his determination that there will be a second film? It all seems possible.</p> <p>Jackson, after all, has the benefit of his work on Rings to endow him with the confidence that he can do it again, even if this time the task is rather more monumental. He also has the clout: the epic, 1000-page plus Lord of the Rings novel was once thought unfilmable; poor Ralph Bakshi couldn't even get the second part of his drastically cut down version finished before funding was pulled. Jackson managed to get three movies into cinemas which received almost universal acclaim from critics and fans alike and made a staggering <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films\">$2.9bn at the global box office</a>. He's the Tolkien daddy.</p> <p>But that doesn't mean he's going to be able to pull it off. With Rings, filmic conventions meant Jackson and his team were required to trim the story, cut out or combine certain characters and pad out other aspects, such as the love affair between Aragorn and Arwen. They did a remarkable job. With The Hobbit, Jackson (and Del Toro) will be trying to create a film which stands alongside those earlier movies from material as thinly sketched as anything in the history of book to movie adaptations. I wish him the best of luck, and I hope to be proved wrong, but I fear this particular quest will end in failure. Even doing it himself isn't going to get Jackson out of this particular Hobbit hole.</p>",

The increase would be 5.3% without them, compared to the 9.4% overall figure.</p> <p>More than 55,000 applicants are still \"pending\" because they are waiting for a decision or deciding whether to accept.</p> <p>A further 119,477 applicants are eligible for Clearing either because they are not holding any offers, did not meet the conditions of their offers or applied late.

Acceptances for biology courses rose by 3%, chemistry by 5%, physics by 4%, maths by 7% and engineering subjects by 6%.

Media studies is fairly flat with a modest fall of 0.4% to 4,048.</p> <p>More people from poorer backgrounds have accepted places this year \u2013 28.3% of teenagers aged 18 and under in lower socio-economic groups up from 27.4% in 2007.</p> <p>Bill Rammell, the higher education minister, said: \"I am extremely pleased to see that figures for university acceptances in England are at an all time high, up by 6% on this time last year. </p> <p>\"I am particularly encouraged by the increase in acceptances from lower socio-economic groups as we continue to work to widen participation in higher education through, for example, greater links between universities and schools and the Aimhigher programme.\"</p> <p>He advised students who have not yet secured a place at university or college to apply through Clearing. \"Clearing is not just for those who miss their predicted grades, but those who haven't considered higher education now have the option to change their minds and apply,\" he said.</p> <p>Wes Streeting, the president of the National Union of Students, welcomed the rise, but added that the incremental increase in the number of poorer students accepting university places was \"not good enough\".<br> \"Institutions must not be complacent when it comes to widening participation among those groups who have not traditionally attended university. They must also be careful to give a fair chance to those who have gained qualifications other than A-levels, but who may nonetheless benefit from higher education,\" he warned.</p>",

  "<p><br>Looking back at happier days ... A sepia shot of the early years of the superheroes in Watchmen</p> <p>Superheroes are not bound by the rule of law. Movie studios, however, are, which is why a collective groan rose from the Warner Bros lot in Los Angeles last week. A federal judge had granted 20th Century Fox the go-ahead to claim the movie rights to Watchmen, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen\">the seminal 1986 graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons</a>. The problem for Warner is that they are well into post-production on a lavishly budgeted adaptation of the comic, directed by Zack Snyder (300), that has already been strenuously hyped ahead of a March 2009 release. There's now a chance - slim but real - that the picture will never see the light of day. </p> <p>It's only the latest twist in one of the most tortuous adaptation histories of contemporary Hollywood. Almost from its initial publication, Watchmen - which is set in an alternative 1985 in which Nixon is still president, the world is edging toward nuclear war and forcibly retired superheroes are being mysteriously bumped off - was praised as cinematic. Certainly, it offers a brilliantly detailed fantasy world and a deliciously noirish plot. But, as Moore promptly pointed out, its power is rooted in attributes like seriality, visual echo and ancillary material that are quintessential to comics but harder to put on film. It is, he said, \"almost the exact opposite of cinematic.\" Not that that's stopped Hollywood trying.</p> <p>Fox acquired rights to the series when it was published, and producer Joel Silver and writer Sam Hamm got to work. They eventually found that Moore had a point, and after five years in development hell, the project was dropped. Over at Warner, Terry Gilliam expressed interest and rewrites began. There was talk of Arnold Schwarzenegger playing <a href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/comics/mooreportal/manhattan.html\">Dr Manhattan, the story's alienated Superman stand-in</a>, but by the end of the 90s this version also foundered on scripting problems and budget concerns.</p> <p>The post-9/11 world seemed to be a better fit for the dark story. That, at least, was screenwriter David Hayter's rationale for the new adaptation he began in late 2001. His script did the rounds of several studios - Universal, Revolution, and finally Paramount, where Darren Aronofsky began developing the project as director in 2004. When he left as well, Paul Greengrass stepped up and the studio seemed to be gung-ho for the idea. But internal ructions and more budgetary concerns saw this version fall apart too.</p> <p>In 2006, the success of Zack Snyder's adaptation of another comic-book property, 300, convinced Warner to greenlight yet another attempt - apparently the most faithful yet. The delays might ultimately have worked to the project's advantage: the comic's subtle repetitions and background material could be a better fit for DVD than the cinema, and Snyder has integrated this in his conception from the start.</p> <p>Whether Fox's lawsuit will result in the film's shelving (or, more likely, a division of profits between the studios) remains to be seen but there are favourable precedents: Spider-Man, for instance, was tangled up in conflicting claims for years but eventually worked out nicely for all involved. Readers of Watchmen, however, and followers of its troubled slog to the screen, know that nothing should be taken at face value.</p>",
  "<p>Much has been said about the generational division between the old guard of black leaders who grew up during the civil rights era and the new cohort raised in post-segregation America. The old guard were apparently united in a notion of a collective black experience, while the younger generation have a more diverse perspective of American life.</p> <p>In a New York Times Magazine cover story titled <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/magazine/10politics-t.html\">\"Is Obama the end of black politics?\"</a>, writer Matt Bai delved into whether or not the new black leaders have brought an end to the racially-orientated politics practised by the likes of Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton.</p> <p>Bai's answer wasn't definitive. The conclusion seemed to be that black people \u2013 and indeed the black community, if you can call it that \u2013 are simply too complex to be able to make straightforward, either/or analyses about. This, to me, is no surprise.</p> <p>The question Bai should have asked isn't whether or not Obama marks the end of \"black politics\" (because this question in itself assumes homogeneity), but whether or not people \u2013 both white and black - will now begin to see black people as much more than just one homogeneous entity who share the same perspectives and the same experiences as each other. In essence, will Obama mark the end of the negative stereotyping of, and generalising about, black people? </p> <p>One of the problems people have had with Obama is that they have been unable to put him into a box. He is racially sensitive to African-American issues, but also deeply passionate about issues facing all Americans. He self-defines as African-American, yet is proud of his bi-racial heritage. He is articulate, charismatic and well educated, yet also in tune with his working-class roots and his background in community activism. His wife, although raised in a poor part of Chicago, is successful and powerful. Although the media has attempted to portray her as an angry, militant black woman, appearances on TV and on the campaign trail have shown her to be kind, family-orientated and down to earth.</p> <p>The Obamas \u2013 in all of their supposed paradox \u2013 represent what \"black\" means today. By this I mean that, by confounding stereotypes, they are showing the world that there is not just one single way to be black.</p> <p>According to a recent <a href=\"http://www.blackamericastudy.com/\">Black America study</a> \u2013 apparently one of the most comprehensive pieces of research ever done on black America, with over 300,000 pieces of data generated \u2013 there are around 11 different and distinct segments within the African-American community, each with a different perspective and outlook on life. As the study says: \"This richer view is particularly important because it clearly shows how blacks and African-Americans are not all the same just because they may be in the same age group, or might be the same gender or live in the same part of the county.\"</p> <p>Some of these segments include the New Middle Class, who are \"the best educated, most employed and wealthiest segment. \u2026 They are more likely to describe themselves as blacks rather than African-Americans and believe that problems in the black community can be best solved by blacks.\" Another segment is the Stretched Black Straddlers, who are \"the most stressed by straddling the needs of family and work. \u2026 They are most likely to say they have been racially discriminated against in the past three months\" The 11 segments most likely do not go far enough toward describing the wealth of difference among black people. </p> <p>While all of this seems like common sense, for many it isn't. Generalisations about black people and the black community occur often, while diversity is overlooked, particularly by the media. In a <a href=\"http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/120747550/abstract\">study published in the Journal of Communication in June</a>, University of Illinois professor <a href=\"http://www.news.uiuc.edu/news/08/0717race.html\">Travis Dixon</a> found that \"network news exposure increased the endorsement of African-American stereotypes, particularly the view that African-Americans were poor and intimidating, and was positively associated with higher racism scores.\" </p> <p>Writing in <a href=\"http://www.theamericanscholar.org/su08/narrative-johnson.html\">the American Scholar</a>, University of Washington professor Charles Johnson says: \"No matter which angle we use to view black people in America today, we find them to be a complex and multifaceted people who defy easy categorisation. We challenge, culturally and politically, an old group narrative that fails at the beginning of this new century to capture even a fraction of our rich diversity and heterogeneity.\" Last year, in fact, <a href=\"http://pewsocialtrends.org/pubs/700/black-public-opinion\">a Pew Research Centre poll</a> revealed that 37% of black people believed that, because of this diversity, \"black people can no longer be thought of as a single race.\" </p> <p>There are, of course, other high-profile African-Americans such as Oprah Winfrey, Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell who have done their part toward changing the public perception of what it means to be black. However, the intense international media focus on Obama is unprecedented and has reached far and wide, generating huge amounts of discussion about race.</p> <p>Of course, Obama is just one man and can only do so much. It's more likely that one's level of daily contact with people of other races has more impact on changing stereotypes than Obama does. Polls on whether or not Obama's impact may or may not be changing people's views on race have also shown mixed results. </p> <p>One thing Obama's candidacy has made is clear though is that it's getting harder to group black people into a single, monolithic entity, which hopefully makes it harder to stereotype us. The New York Times asked whether this was the end of \"black politics\". I ask whether this is the end of an era in which one is even able to ask such a question.</p>",
  "<p>Leo Abse, the Labour MP who piloted a bill through the Commons legalising homosexuality, has died at the age of 91, a family friend said today. </p> <p>Abse, who represented first Pontypool and then Torfaen in the Commons for almost 30 years, died at Charing Cross hospital, west London, last night after a short illness. </p> <p>A former solicitor, he guided a private member's bill through parliament in 1967 that legalised sex between men over the age of 21. </p> <p>Roy Jenkins, the then Labour home secretary, helped Abse by allowing the bill to be debated in government time. But at the time there was considerable hostility towards homosexuality and the passage of the bill was never a foregone conclusion.</p> <p>Abse was also credited with helping to liberalise divorce laws through the 1969 Divorce Reform Act. </p> <p>The two backbench bills, along with the outlawing capital punishment and the legalisation of abortion, were subsequently seen as probably the most important pieces of legislation passed by parliament in the 1960s. They heralded an era of dramatic social change.</p> <p>Abse retired from parliament in 1987 and subsequently wrote several books influenced by his interest in Freudian analysis, including critical psychoanalytic biographies of Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair.</p> <p>Abse's efforts to change the law on homosexuality and divorce led Labour prime minister James Callaghan to tell him: \"You do much more good in terms of human happiness than 90% of the work done in Parliament on political issues...\" </p> <p>Today the Wales secretary, Paul Murphy, paid tribute to Abse, saying he was \"deeply sad\" at the news. </p> <p>\"He was a personal friend for well over 40 years,\" he said. </p> <p>\"He was a very distinguished parliamentarian and social reformer who has left an indelible mark on his country. The lives of millions of people over the years have been improved because of his social reforms. </p> <p>\"Leo was a passionate Welshman and a fine constituency MP for the eastern valley, which he represented in parliament for nearly 30 years. </p> <p>\"I personally owe him a great debt, and I know that MPs from all sides of the house will mourn his passing.\" </p> <p>Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock and his wife Glenys added their voices to the tributes. </p> <p>\"Leo was courageous, highly principled, very funny and totally unique,\" they said in a statement. \"We are glad that he had such a long and fulfilling life in which he gained so much social progress by being an outstanding free-thinking socialist.\" </p> <p>The Liberal Democrat equalities spokeswoman, Lynne Featherstone, said: \"As a nation we should be grateful for his contribution as a parliamentarian. </p> <p>\"He spearheaded some of the most momentous changes in legislation, paving the way for greater equality. </p> <p>\"His successes in parliament freed many from the shackles of paternalism and bigotry, allowing us some of the basic liberties we now take for granted.\"</p> <p>Abse is survived by his second wife, Ania.</p>",
  "<p>Almost a century has passed since Spanish intellectuals rallied to fight back against the \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Legend\">black legend</a>\" (<a href=\"http://wais.stanford.edu/Spain/spain_blacklegendin18thcentury32502.html\">la leyenda negra</a>), but, as recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/15/olympics2008.olympicstennis\">off-the-field events</a> at the Olympics have shown, it is still casting a dark shadow over Europe. Only defined in 1914 by <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=IcmrVmq0_-8C&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=Julian+Juderias&amp;source=web&amp;ots=N-UdZctE57&amp;sig=I4z-xHtcWp2jSnHTuIzxhs6hXQI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result\">Juli\u00e1n Juder\u00edas</a>, the \"black legend\" refers to the centuries-old idea of Spain possessing an intolerance and lust for blood unparalleled within Europe. Supported by the worst excesses of the Inquisition and the conquistadores, art, history and literature from the Enlightenment to Hemingway have presented the Spaniards as, at best romantic and simple folk, and at worst morally degenerate with unique sanguinary propensities.<br> As with all legends, the notion that Spain is, uniquely \"ignorant, fanatical and inclined toward violent repression\" has some grounding in historical fact, but it was nevertheless fundamentally born out of the imperialistic propaganda of the 16th century.  Despite this, the image of Spain as a backward \"fragment of Africa, soldered so cruelly to inventive Europe\", as WH Auden put it, has endured to this day. Germany included, it is unlikely that any other country would be subjected to such allegations of inherent racism among its people on the back of a couple of ill-judged photos. Spain is, and always has been, \"different\".  Of course, it was only right that the Spanish athletes and sports officials should be condemned for their decision to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/16/olympicsandthemedia.spain?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=media\">make slit-eyed gestures</a> prior to setting off for Beijing, particularly when Madrid is looking to host the Olympics within the next decade. Likewise, whether brought about by genuine racism or an ignorance of cultural considerations, it is pertinent that references to the abuse targeted at black players in La Liga or seen on the country's grand prix circuits were once again brought up. In terms of tackling racism in sport, Spain is indeed dragging its heels and needs to get its house in order. <br> However, the reactions of the past few days have more than occasionally gone beyond criticising the behaviour of individuals and those within the sporting arena and into the realms of national temperament, and yes, even race.  Media commentators and sports fans alike have put the incident down to unique backwardness of the Spanish people, of whom no more is to be expected. Spain is simply the Duke of Edinburgh of western Europe, to be simultaneously condemned and patronised. Writing in the Times, <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/rod_liddle/article4547325.ece\">Rod Liddle observed</a> that \"suddenly confronted with foreigners, the Spanish become unreconstructedly PC or magnificently obnoxious,\" with the country \"still last in the PC stakes\". Going further, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/columnists/dom-joly/dom-joly-dont-cheer-team-boosa-they-need-to-learn-the-art-of-diplomacy-900742.html\">Dom Joly in the Independent</a> took this as an opportunity to roll out the usual stereotypes, alluding to Spaniards \"hurling donkeys off a church tower while laughing heinously\". Even in the Guardian, while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/15/race.olympics2008?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=worldnews\">Mark Tran argued</a> that \"there is no point getting too worked up over this foolishness\", which he made sure to refer to only within the context of sporting events, a significant proportion of comments clearly concurred with Alexander Dumas's oft-quoted put-down that \"Africa begins in the Pyrenees\", though without the excuse of historical relativism. <br> \"Spain is not as advanced as Britain in its attitude to race sensitivity\", one reader noted, backed up by claims that \"many Spanish people are incredibly racist\", and that \"Spain is remarkably backward in this respect\", while there were also calls for a special diversity programme to be rolled out to \"help Spaniards control their racism\".  Such a reliance on sweeping generalisations is hardly likely to solve the problem that does exist and, in a week when the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/derbyshire/7565354.stm\">BNP enjoyed</a> its annual jolly to the countryside and a London teenager died in an <a href=\"http://itn.co.uk/news/1c1c6b9a32c687d8c6cb36769af01b15.html\">apparently racist stabbing</a>, it may even prompt some Spaniards to dismiss genuine concerns as mere hypocrisy. <br> As the Spanish revisionist historian <a href=\"http://libros.libertaddigital.com/antony-beevor-una-historia-de-mucha-clase-1276230674.html\">P\u00eda Moa </a><a href=\"http://mangans.blogspot.com/2005/10/antony-beevors-spanish-civil-war-and.html\">once said</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>Going down this path, we might define England as the homeland of piracy and slave trafficking, which weighed so heavily in the nation's formation and prosperity.</p> </blockquote> <p>Just as it has been for hundreds of years, the idea of Spain being uniquely intolerant and backward may well be supported by individual examples of shortcomings, but is fundamentally unjustified. It has been argued that the drive to create a <a href=\"http://www.upress.umn.edu/Books/D/deguzman_spains.html\">morally inferior</a> \"other\" in the 16th century arose partly from the need to justify the shortcomings of the English, Dutch, and then the French empires. Should this still be the case, the endurance of the \"black legend\" looks all but guaranteed for the some time yet.</p>",

  "<p>After David Miliband published his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jul/29/davidmiliband.labour\">\"I'm an alternative Labour leader\"</a> article in the Guardian, some people wondered whether Gordon Brown would sack him as foreign secretary. Having just read <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/19/davidcameron.conservatives\">an extraordinary piece on Comment is free</a>, I'm wondering whether that's happened already.</p> <p>It's by Nick Brown. Nick Brown used to be the deputy chief whip. And I've just checked - he still is. Except now he seems to be in charge of the government's foreign policy.</p> <p>The article is mainly about David Cameron (whom he describes, memorably, as the \"Bullingdon Bismarck\"), but this is what Brown says about Georgia's proposed membership of Nato.</p> <blockquote> <p>Cameron urges Nato to admit Georgia. Nato is a mutual defence pact. This position will have gone down very well in Tbilisi, but do we really mean to commit ourselves to all-out war against the Russian Federation if something like this happens again? I don't favour that approach, and I don't know anyone who does.</p> </blockquote> <p>He goes on:</p> <blockquote> <p>There is a bigger point here. If western hawks really are advocating Nato membership for every small country that borders the Russian Federation, even a government far more charitably disposed towards Nato than the present Russian one is going to see the move as a direct challenge.</p> </blockquote> <p>But yesterday, following the meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels, <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/newsroom/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=5507391\">Miliband said this</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>I think in respect of Georgia it's very significant that in May Nato committed not just to Georgia but also to the Ukraine that they would join other formerly, so-called, captive states of the former Warsaw Pact in Nato. And what we're going to agree today is a special mechanism that will bind Nato and Georgia together, a Nato and Georgia commission that will take forward that commitment to Georgian membership.</p> </blockquote> <p>And I've just read the lead story on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/20/georgia.nato\">the front page of our news site</a> The headline says: \"Georgia's Nato membership on track, says David Miliband\".</p> <p>And if that's not clear, Jim Murphy, the Europe minister, said this <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/newsroom/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=5484275\">on the BBC at the start of the week</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>I think the way to stabilise the region is to say to those democracies, of which Georgia is a very strong one, that if they reform their economies and continue to be democracies they can join the European Union and they can also join Nato.</p> </blockquote> <p>So while Nick Brown is saying it would be a mistake for Russia to be surrounded by Nato members, the Foreign Office is explicitly saying that that would be a good thing.</p> <p>What's going on? Imagine that you're the Georgian ambassador in London and you have to tell Tbilisi what the British government's policy actually is. Do you listen to the foreign secretary, knowing that the Gordon Brown views him as a bitter rival, or do you listen to Nick Brown, who is, of course, famous for being one of the prime minister's most loyal allies.</p> <p>The Foreign Office tells me that Miliband and Nick Brown both think it would be a mistake for Georgia to join Nato now, as Cameron seems to be advocating. But when I put it to the press office that Brown was arguing against Georgia joining per se, I was told clearly: \"That's not the government's position.\"</p> <p>Brown doesn't normally speak out on foreign affairs. In fact, like most whips, he does not normally speak out publicly at all. His Cif article was unsolicited; he didn't write it because he was asked to by us.</p> <p>Is he trying to undermine Miliband? Is he speaking out because he thinks Miliband has adopted the wrong stance? If so, does Gordon Brown agree?</p> <p>Or did he just write the piece without bothering to check what the Foreign Office line was? MPs who do this get reprimanded by the whips. If this is the case, then Nick Brown can bollock himself.</p> <p>I'll let you know if I find out more. At the very least, it looks pretty shambolic.</p>",
  "<p><strong>1.28pm</strong> It is difficult to work out who has had the worse month, Kent or Lancashire, <em>writes Paul Weaver at Canterbury</em>. Kent have lost two one-day cup finals and slipped from being championship contenders to one place above what footie folk would call the relegation zone after being beaten on a poor pitch at Durham.</p> <p>Lancashire must feel grateful that they have escaped with draws from their last three home matches from Old Trafford, where they have been outplayed by Hampshire, Sussex and Yorkshire, which means that their slender title ambitions survive in what has been a damp and strange championship season.</p> <p>Both captains have also been in the wars. Rob Key was tipped for an England comeback a few weeks ago, even as captain. Instead he has presided over the collapse of his team's fortunes and at the weekend he described their batting as \"brainless\" after a disappointing performance in the Friends Provident final against Essex at Lord's.</p> <p>Lancashire captain Stuart Law, meanwhile, has apologised to the club after criticising his employers over the decision to dispense with Dominic Cork. Much to play for, then.</p> <p>Kent won the toss and chose to bat and were doing well enough at 41 without loss. But they have just gone to lunch on 61 for three. Key was run out when Joe Denly's drive was deflected onto the stumps by the bowler, Sajid Mahmood, Denly was caught in the gully, cutting, and the in-form Martin van Jaarsveld was lbw to one that nipped back from Cork. There's a new look to this Lancashire side, who have brought back Mal Loye and Mark Chilton for Lou Vincent and the recently retired Iain Sutcliffe.</p> <p><strong>2pm</strong> After a season-and-a-half and 39 matches trying, Michael Lumb finally got a century for Hampshire this morning, <em>writes Mike Averis at the Rose Bowl</em>. The Yorkshire batsman, who joined Hampshire at the start of 2007, took almost five hours getting the job done, but after adding 52 to his overnight score he went to lunch undefeated on 101.</p> <p>Last season the 28-year-old Lumb got to 50 eight times and had passed the half-century mark four times this season, top-scoring with 82 against Sussex back in April, without being able to convert. In fact the last time he had reached three figures in the championship was when, as a Yorkshire middle-order batsman, he made 105 against Hampshire in July 2006.</p> <p>This time, because of back injuries to both John Crawley and Greg Lamb, he was pushed up the order, batting at No3 and came to the wicket when Hampshire had lost opener Michael Carberry with the score on 41. Overnight, with Hampshire at 113 for four, Lumb was on 49 and went on to reach his half-century, off 105 balls, during the third over of the day.</p> <p>Ninety-three deliveries later he had passed three figures, but it wasn't easy going. There were some elegant drives and cuts through the offside and one forced boundary off the back foot before nerves set in once he had passed his previous best score of the season.</p> <p>Andy Caddick, captaining instead of the injured Justin Langer, joined in the mind games, rotating his bowlers before he took the new ball with Lumb on 95. The former England bowler's second delivery was eased back past the bowler and up to the pavilion for a 15th boundary of the innings. The third was horribly mistimed, but flew safely between bowler and mid-off for two and celebrations on the stroke of lunch.</p> <p>Hampshire, one off bottom place in the first division, had put on 83 in the session for the loss of 18-year-old Liam Dawson for 17 to an arm ball from Ian Blackwell, the pick of Somerset's bowlers both yesterday and so far today. Sean Ervine is 16 not out.</p> <p><strong>3.40pm</strong> Five sessions into the match and Somerset finally pulled alongside Nottinghamshire at the top of the first division, <em>writes Mike Averis at the Rose Bowl</em>, with Hampshire going for quick runs and losing five wickets in the session.</p> <p>Michael Lumb, 101 at lunch, added six before a fired-up Andy Caddick found the thinnest of edges as Sean Ervine began to tuck into anything short, moving the run rate along to a near-frenetic six an over.</p> <p>He and Dimitri Mascarenhas had added 46 in seven overs before two fine slip catches from Marcus Trescothick brought a pause in the excitement. First Ervine, on 69 including 12 boundaries, was snapped up, taken low down by Trescothick diving away to his left at second slip.</p> <p>Even better, the former England opener went high and to his right to take an edge from David Balcombe, again two handed, off Caddick. The stand-in Somerset captain bowled for most of the session, his 11 overs after lunch worth two wickets, but costing 50 runs as Mascarenhas pushed on to 41 off 58 balls.</p> <p>The Hampshire innings - and the three points Somerset needed - ended smack on tea with the score at 316 when Mascarenhas was caught on the crease, lbw to Ian Blackwell and James Tomlinson lost his off stump third ball.</p>",
  "<p>For my British readers, here's a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/14/usa.internationalcrime\">piece of news</a> that will make you feel as smug and superior as you could possibly imagine.</p> <p>It seems that tomorrow, the great state of Texas <a href=\"http://www.oag.state.tx.us/oagnews/release.php?id=2602\">will put to death a man</a> who didn't even kill anybody. Jeffery Lee Wood was the wheelman in a 1996 armed holdup of a Texaco station in which his partner in crime shot and killed the store clerk. Wood acted in a way that sanctioned his partner's actions.

The governor, Martin O'Malley, is against the death penalty but would apply state law without regard to his personal beliefs, which is the usual Democratic wiggle move. I guess I understand this politically. </p> <p>Besides, the reality is that no one is likely to be killed by the state of Maryland. A state like Maryland is likely governed by the kind of people who'll follow due process reasonably faithfully and look at the expense of appeal after appeal and decide it isn't worth the trouble.

  "<p>Long awaited action role player <a href=\"http://toohuman.net/\">Too Human</a> is out next week. I recently spoke to Denis Dyack from the developer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Knights\">Silicon Knights</a> and asked him about controls, general reaction to the game and why he thinks Too Human is one of the most innovative games on the 360.</p> <p><strong>Too Human has had a tortuous development. What are your overriding feelings at this point as the game nears release?</strong><br>It's kind of like a shock right now, it hasn't sunk in yet. There have been some positives, particularly in the number of downloads. The reception to the demo has been massively positive.</p> <p><strong>Why do you think there aren't many Diablo/dungeon crawler type games around at the moment?</strong><br>Well it's kind of funny. When we first partnered with Microsoft we sat down with them and asked ourselves what kind of game could define itself on the console. Action RPG games are usually controlled by the mouse. By moving to dual stick analogue joypad controller and creating an automatic camera system we managed to jump that hurdle. We had eight years research into our camera system and have patented the technology. You're not seeing many of these kind of games on console because they wouldn't work without the dual stick controller and automatic camera. This is innovative and really hard to do, that's why these games are quite rare. I'll be shocked if there is any game in this genre that comes close to Too Human in the next couple of years.</p> <p><strong>A lot of the feedback from the demo concerned the controls. Do you think players will eventually get used to them?</strong><br>I think so. You'll get some first time players who may not get it. The combat is incredibly deep and takes time to get used to. It's really funny, people say they want innovation. You know, this is probably too much hyperbole but Too Human is one of the most innovative games on the 360, period. This is because of the control and camera scheme. People don't know what they are seeing and their first reaction is I don't get that. But once they get it people love it.</p> <p><strong>How important are the RPG elements?</strong><br>The RPG stuff matters just as much as the action. You can't get by on one alone. The RPG stuff is incredibly deep. The amount of loot customisation is out of control. We've had people playing through the entire game without really knowing what charms are. Once they get hold of that even more depth appears. But you need the action side too. We've had people say they they've got through the game and not had to use air combat. This means they're not having as much fun as they should as they won't be getting combos in combat. There is a lot of RPG and action bits, and loads to do.</p> <p><strong>How important is the story?</strong><br>Well story has always been important to us here at Silicon Knights. The story of Too Human is three times the size of <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/adventure/eternaldarknesssr/review.html\">Eternal Darkness</a>. This in terms of script and narrative. But Eternal Darkness was some gamplay with a lot of story while Too Human is more mixed. When you playthrough the game for the first time the story is very important. But when you want to replay and level your character to 50 the story is less important. So the story is important to us but it is not the be all and end all.</p> <p><strong>How important is co-op?</strong><br>Co-op really adds to the game and works great through Live. Live is a great backbone as otherwise we would have had to build it ourselves. It is easy to invite a friend or play with someone else using Live. You can really customise your co-op game too and set things like loot sharing. It's all seamless too, you can play single player then go to co-op then back again very easily.</p> <p><strong>What about puzzle elements in the game to break up the action?</strong><br>There are some light puzzle sections in the cyberspace. But we didn't want people getting stuck so we are generally very puzzle light.</p> <p><strong>Can you explain a bit more about cyberspace?</strong><br>It's like an alternative realm. Cyberspace is host to what are essentially the librarians of the story. They are trying to preserve all the knowledge. It's the natural equivalent of the internet in our era. This lets us use some puzzles, so if you open a door in Cyberspace it opens in the real game world. It's essentially like hacking. You can find all these ancient technologies and find some great loot in Cyberspace. We'll be focussing more on it in the second and third games but we just wanted to give users a taste of it in here.</p> <p><strong>How varied are the classes?</strong><br>There are five and this is a hybrid game so the classes are based on the archetypes. So Champion is your critical strike and air combat class, Beserker is your damage dealer, Defender is your tank, commando is your shooter an Bio engineer is your fighter/healer. We have 60 or so testers but that doesn't compare to the amount of users who will play when released so we will keep an eye out for balancing issues and patch if necessary. This game is built for downloadable content so we're not too worried.</p> <p><strong>Eternal Darkness 2?</strong> It's possible (laughs). We get asked that all the time.</p> <p><strong>Why do think people have such good memories of Eternal Darkness?</strong><br>It's really strange. I think it was such a different game that people put a lot on it. It sure wasn't a box office hit! I don't know, it was very content driven. A horror game that wasn't a survival horror. When you make a game you make a game that you want to play yourself. We added lots of unique aspects to Eternal Darkness, such as the game playing tricks on you. Every game we make we try to do something new and different. With Too Human it seems we have been so innovative that we have put some people off. I hope the negative reaction gets turned around and people really appreciate this game. We think Too Human is our best game to date. Too Human will have legs. You finish most games and you don't want to play them again but I've finished this game 50-100 times now and I'm still finding new things like armour sets that I haven't seen before. We think it's coming out at a good time too.</p> <p>Too Human is released on Aug 29th. I <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/games/archives/2008/08/19/too_human_review.html\">recently reviewed</a> it.</p>",
  "<p>Chinese authorities have sentenced two women in their 70s to a year's \"re-education through labour\" after they applied to protest during the Olympic games, a relative said today.</p> <p>This week, officials said they had not approved a single permit for a demonstration, despite designating three parks as protest zones.</p> <p>The International Olympic Committee's communications director said she would look at the women's case, but stressed that the games were \"not a panacea for all ills\".</p> <p>Wu Dianyuan, 79, and her neighbour Wang Xiuying, 77, sought to protest about their forced eviction from their homes in 2001. They went to the Beijing Public Security Bureau four times this month to request permission to demonstrate in the new zones \u2014 created for the Olympics to counter criticism of the limits to political expression in China.</p> <p>Their applications were neither granted nor denied, but on their first trip PSB officers interrogated them for 10 hours, Wu's son, Li Xuehui, told the New York-based group Human Rights in China.</p> <p>On August 17, the two women received an order dated July 30 from Beijing's \"re-education through labour commission\" sentencing them to one year for \"disturbing the public order\". It placed restrictions on their movements and warned that if they breached any of the requirements they would be sent to a labour camp. The system does not require formal hearings or allow appeals.</p> <p>Li told the Associated Press the women were at home under the observation of a neighbourhood committee. He said no cause had been given for the order.</p> <p>When Wu and Wang returned to the PSB on August 18, officers said they could not apply to protest because of their sentence.</p> <p>\"Punishing Wu and Wang after they applied for protest permits and actively petitioned the government demonstrates that the official statements touting the new Olympics protest zones \u2026 were no more than a show,\" said Sharon Hom, the executive director of Human Rights in China.</p> <p>On Monday, following a week of questions, the official news agency Xinhua reported that 77 applications had been made.</p> <p>But citing a PSB spokesman, it said 74 were withdrawn because the problems \"were properly addressed by relevant authorities or departments through consultations\"; two were suspended because they provided insufficient information; and one was rejected because it violated laws by including a child.</p> <p>Protests that might harm \"national unity\" and \"national, social or collective interests\" are forbidden, and application forms request details ranging from the applicant's work unit to slogans to be chanted and the size and content of banners.</p> <p>With no demonstrations pending at Beijing's World Park, perhaps the most surreal choice for a protest zone, tourists happily traipsed past miniature models of the pyramids and Britain's houses of parliament this week. In the Ritan and Purple Bamboo Parks, local residents played chequers and chatted. The only sign of their special status was an increased security presence.</p> <p>Wang Wei, vice-president of the Beijing organising committee, told reporters they should be \"satisfied\" with the protest zones.</p> <p>\"The idea of demonstration is that you are hoping to resolve issues, not to demonstrate for the sake of demonstrating. We are pleased that issues have been resolved through dialogue and communication \u2014 this is how we do it in Chinese culture,\" he told a press conference.</p> <p>\"We want everyone to express their opinion. Everyone has the right to speak; this is not the same as demonstrating.\"</p> <p>Giselle Davies, the International Olympic Committee's director of communications, said Beijing was one of several host cities to have created protest zones. \"We asked for as much transparency as possible and we asked that the areas should be genuinely used,\" she said.</p> <p>Davies said she would look Wang and Wu's case, but added: \"The Olympics are about sport. We are aware of the wider issues but opening the door through the Olympics is a catalyst for development here. That catalytic effect is happening. But the Olympics are not a panacea for all ills.\"</p> <p>Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher for Human Rights Watch, said: \"The empirical evidence points in the opposite direction: the games have had an overall negative impact. We are seeing a pattern of serious violations of rights.\"</p> <p>According to Human Rights Watch, another would-be protester, Ji Sizun, has been uncontactable since visiting a Beijing police station last Monday to check on the progress of a permit application. Witnesses saw several men escorting the grassroots activist away in an unmarked car.</p> <p>Other people reported being halted en route to Beijing, or being forcibly removed from the capital by officials from their hometowns as they sought to protest.</p>",
  "<p>Legal and judicial reform might seem a strange subject to support in Afghanistan where so many basic material needs go unaddressed, but it lies at the heart of the challenge facing those involved in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/15/afghanistan\">country's reconstruction</a>.</p> <p>The international community has belatedly recognised that it got the template wrong after the ousting of the Taliban at the end of 2001. As the <a href=\"http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=5285&amp;l=1\">International Crisis Group</a> notes, its strategy of \"co-opting rather than challenging the warlords and commanders\" of the victorious Northern Alliance embedded them within the Afghan state and \"sowed the seeds of the culture of impunity that has since flourished.\" The Taliban's subsequent revival has largely been a consequence of this failure and the counter-insurgency also rests on some increasingly unconvincing assumptions.</p> <p>The alternative approach is that re-establishing the rule of law could give Afghans a genuine sense of ownership of their state by enabling them to hold politicians and public officials accountable for their actions. A proper vetting process would have excluded war criminals, drug barons and militia leaders from the country's parliamentary elections and a strong and independent judiciary could have challenged some of the corruption and criminality that have become endemic in public life. It may be too late to do anything about the former, but at least a start has been made on addressing the latter issue.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.idlo.int/\">International Development Law Organisation</a> (IDLO) is one of a number of organisations that have been tasked with trying to strengthen Afghanistan's justice system over the last six years. I have spent the last month helping to evaluate the programmes that it has established in Afghanistan \u2013 and I am writing this after submitting my report to them.</p> <p>Founded in the early 1980s, its executive director, Bill Loris, had previously worked as a legal advisor for USAid, first in Africa and then Egypt. His work in Africa mainly involved drafting contracts between African governments, USAid and its implementing partners, a process which convinced him that developing countries often get a raw deal due to a lack of local legal expertise. He arrived in Egypt shortly after the signing of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_David_Accords\">Camp David peace agreement</a> with Israel in 1978, one of the side-deals of which was that both countries would receive $1bn a year from the US. Administering this huge slush-fund was a difficult task and further convinced Loris that throwing money at countries that do not have adequate supervisory mechanisms can sometimes do more harm than good. The highly politically-charged context in which aid is being delivered in Afghanistan provides another illustration of how donors often fail to learn from their previous mistakes.</p> <p>Loris co-founded IDLO in 1983 with two young lawyer colleagues. Amongst its earliest supporters were <a href=\"http://www.opecfund.org/publications/ar01/boxes/box1.htm\">Ibrahim Sihata</a>, the Egyptian director general of the Opec fund, and <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2268819.stm\">Hans Blix</a>, the future weapons inspector \u2013 who was at the time Sweden's minister of justice. The organis ation opened an office in Italy and began to conduct training mainly for Arab and African governments. It also started running courses on investment and trade law, commercial contracts and intellectual property rights; and was one of the first organisations to provide technical support to the Chinese government on these issues. Its projects became longer and more diverse and, by the end of the 1980s it decided to transform itself from a non-governmental organisation (NGO) to an inter-governmental organisation (IGO) established by international treaty.</p> <p>IDLO currently has 18 member countries \u2013 including Egypt, Italy, the US and China \u2013 with a further 10 country applications pending. It won permanent observer status at the United Nations in 2001 and began to open its first field offices at around the same time. It started a legal reconstruction programme in East Timor in 2000 and established a presence in Afghanistan in 2002.</p> <p>Working in post-conflict zones is a new challenge for the organisation and one of the main difficulties is that its effectiveness can only really be judged over the long-term and can never be separated from the wider political context. Public opinion surveys show that most Afghans do not trust their official court system and that fears about insecurity and corruption are amongst their largest concerns. The police are also widely regarded as venally rapacious, although public confidence in the Afghan army appears to be growing. </p> <p>After a seriously awful start, the international community is beginning to develop a more coherent strategy towards security sector reform in Afghanistan. As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/27/winningthebattleslosingthewar\">Ilana Bet-El</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/05/dontabandonafghanistan\">Daniel Korski</a> have argued, there needs to be an emphasis away from combat operations and less talk of military victories. You don't win people's hearts and minds by bombing them from the air \u2013 not even if you offer them an aid package afterwards. The slower, less glamorous, work involves building local capacity, strengthening accountability and targeting assistance where it can actually make a difference. Whether the change in emphasis is too little and too late remains to be seen, but with luck it might help Afghans to build a state that is worth defending.</p>",

  "<p>Leo Abse, a Lilliputian Welsh fire-cracker, spent nearly 30 years as a Labour MP in a career seemingly designed to provoke minor but regular political explosions, to shock, and to draw attention to his own bizarre personality. </p> <p>But he left his greatest surprise until he was 83, by marrying Ania Czeputkowska, a 33-year-old electrician and later a textile designer from Gdansk in Poland, in July 2000. </p> <p>This was five years after the death of his wife Marjorie, after 40 years of marriage. </p> <p>Before his second marriage, he spoke poignantly about widowerhood, saying: \"Although I was holding on, it was tough. It was an arid period. You behave stoically, but not happily.\" </p> <p>His literary output included in 1996 a book about Tony Blair and \"The Politics of Perversion\", demonstrating that Abse, then 79, had no intention of mellowing with age. </p> <p>This volume was plainly as startling as his earlier \"psycho-biography\" of Margaret Thatcher, in which he offered highly fanciful and occasionally erotic explanations for her obsession with litter, money, and her general personality. </p> <p>Then, in 2000, another Abse book came out, Fellatio, Masochism, Politics and Love, a bizarre volume in which he offered \"an analysis of the repressed homosexual components of the relationship between Gordon Brown and Tony Blair\". </p> <p>In 2001, Abse created a political storm by suggesting that the late Lord Tonypandy (formerly George Thomas), the ex-Speaker of the Commons, was a secret homosexual in the days when homosexuality was a criminal offence. </p> <p>Leo Abse, who was born on April 22 1917, was the reporter's friend - and foe - in the House of Commons. </p> <p>He spoke at about 350 words a minute, fast-track, fluent and sparkling Welsh waffle that broke many a shorthand-writer's spirit. But he knew how to interest the press, through the issues he raised: homosexuality, divorce and capital punishment. </p> <p>He was so successful that he got more backbench socially reforming legislation on the statute book than any other individual MP in the 20th century. </p> <p>Every budget day Abse's tailor transformed him into a strutting, gaudy peacock. His carefully timed appearance in the chamber, resplendent in outrageous yet elegant attire, was calculated to upstage the chancellor himself. It usually did. </p> <p>His sartorial ideas were as unpredictable as his books. And the distinguished Dover Street tailors, Kilgour, French and Stanbury, were occasionally a little stand-offish, not to say nervous, about some of his proposals. <br>\"But since I've been elected one of the 10 best dressed men in Britain, they're getting into the spirit,\" Abse once proclaimed. </p> <p>One of his favourite outfits was a brown and black Prince of Wales check suit with cuffed sleeves, a lapelled waistcoat and no turn-ups, set off by a vast amber signet ring. </p> <p>But psychoanalysis, which he encountered as a teenager in Cardiff when he was reading Marx, rather than the cut of the tuxedo, was Abse's principal fascination. </p> <p>\"Politicians hate psychoanalysis,\" he once said. \"They are all extroverts who affect that there is no internal reality, that reality is only external.\" </p> <p>Abse, a solicitor, was MP for Pontypool from 1958 until 1983, and for Torfaen until he retired from Westminster in 1987. James Callaghan once wrote to him: \"You do much more good in terms of human happiness than 90% of the work done in parliament on political issues...\"</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron is going to stop Conservative MPs sitting in alliance with Russian parliamentarians who support Vladimir Putin in an influential Europe-wide assembly.</p> <p>The Tories have decided that they cannot continue sitting in the European Democrat group in the Council of Europe after being accused by Labour of \"hypocrisy\".</p> <p>On Saturday, in a high-profile and controversial intervention, Cameron flew to the capital of Georgia, Tbilisi, to express solidarity with its people following the invasion by its neighbour, Russia.</p> <p>Cameron adopted a more robust, anti-Russian stance than the government has. He called for Russia to be suspended from membership of the G8 group of industrialised nations and for Georgia's entry into Nato to be brought forward.</p> <p>But yesterday Denis MacShane, the Labour former Europe minister, said it was hypocritical for Cameron to pose as anti-Russian in Georgia when Conservative MPs were sitting alongside parliamentarians from Putin's United Russia party in the Council of Europe.</p> <p>There are 47 countries in the Council of Europe, which was set up after the second world war to promote human rights and the rule of law. It has a parliamentary assembly, made up of parliamentarians from member states, and MPs sit in groups that reflect their political beliefs.</p> <p>Many centre-right parties from EU countries sit in the European People's Party group. But the Conservatives do not share the pro-Europeanism of many parties in the EPP and instead they sit in the European Democrat group with United Russia and other parties.</p> <p>MacShane told <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/aug/19/cameronaccusedofhypocrisyo\">theguardian.com that it was hypocritical of Cameron</a> to advocate firm anti-Russian policies \"when he leads the only major European party that works with the Kremlin in the Council of Europe\".</p> <p>But, when the Conservatives were asked for a comment, they said they would be pulling out of the group.</p> <p>A spokeswoman said: \"Given the recent events in Georgia, we do not believe that the current arrangement in the European Democrat group in the Council of Europe parliamentary assembly can continue as it is.</p> <p>\"We are already in the process of consulting our partners within the group, such as the Polish Law and Justice party and the Czech Civic Democrats about the way forward.\"</p> <p>She said that talks about a new grouping had been going on for some time and were not just prompted by the \"hypocrisy\" allegations. She also said that, because negotiations were under way, it was not possible yet to say what the outcome would be.</p> <p>MacShane said today that he welcomed the Tory decision. But he said that Cameron ought to go further.</p> <p>\"Cameron needs to support a common European foreign policy and the mechanism in the Lisbon treaty that will achieve this,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Putin supports the idea of a Europe of a loose grouping of nation states which is also Cameron's line and which would allow the Russians to play one EU member state off against another.\"</p>",
  "<p>Comparison sites sell themselves on being one-stop shops that take consumers straight to the best deals on the market. But according to a report published today by the consumer group Which?, people using the websites could end up rather confused. </p> <p>The group shopped on <a href=\"http://www.gocompare.com/\">gocompare.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.confused.com/\">Confused.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.moneysupermarket.com/\">moneysupermarket.com</a> for a number of straightforward financial products including insurance, home loans and credit cards. It found the cheapest products varied hugely between websites.</p> <p>The cheapest home contents policy ranged from \u00a351 on gocompare.com to \u00a371 on Confused.com. For credit cards, moneysupermarket.com came up with a card with an APR of 6.8%, while gocompare.com's cheapest card had an APR of 12.9%. </p> <p>It also proved cheaper to buy directly from providers in some cases. Bradford &amp; Bingley's home contents insurance policy cost \u00a368 if bought from the insurer's own website, but \u00a372 from moneysupermarket.com, \u00a383 on Confused.com and \u00a3100 on gocompare.com. </p> <p>Making a true comparison based on the information shown on the sites also proved difficult. Some sites did not make clear the amount of excess that would be payable in the event of an insurance claim, for example, potentially multiplying the cost of insurance. </p> <p>Which? said consumers would need to use a variety of comparison sites to make sure they were getting the best deals. </p> <p>\"You need to use two or three comparison sites and check directly with providers to get the best quote, and remember that cheapest isn't always best - it's a false economy if you don't get enough cover for your needs or have to pay a huge excess if you claim,\" said Martyn Hocking, editor of Which? Money.</p> <p>Hayley Parsons, chief executive officer of gocompare.com, defended the site: \"There are various reasons why Which? may have found quotes differed from site to site. For example, some comparison sites don't compare as many insurers or products as we do, therefore the search results would be different.\" </p> <p>\"In addition, there are still some assumptions used by other comparison sites that can mean people get seemingly lower premiums - by contrast we ask every question possible to get an accurate premium that we can then guarantee won't change when you go through to the insurer.\"</p> <p>Stuart Glendinning, managing director of moneysupermarket.com, said the report was not comprehensive. </p> <p>\"Accuracy is of paramount importance to us,\" he said. \"Moneysupermarket.com is the only price comparison website with a clear commitment to customers on how it will behave.</p> <p>\"Our customer promise makes it clear that our aim is to compare more providers than any other site, to list every provider (and make clear which ones we don't list and why), that the price you see is the price you pay, and that you won't get cheaper by going direct.\"</p> <p>Carlton Hood, chief executive of Confused.com, questioned the research given the small number of test quotes used.</p> <p>\"More than one million customers per month visit Confused.com for quotations, and last year 1.2 million people saved money by using the website,\" he said.</p> <p>\"It would have been very difficult for those customers to have made those savings without using a price comparison site. On average, customers using Confused.com saved \u00a3208 on car insurance and \u00a3193 on home insurance.\"</p> <p>He went on to say that the price comparison industry was complex and that a constant audit process was required to make sure the most competitive deals were available to customers.</p> <p>\"Our last internal audit found that, in 96% of cases, customers are offered the same price via Confused.com as they are when they go direct. In the very small number of cases where a discrepancy occurs, we bring this to the attention of the insurer and rectify the situation.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.match.com\">Match.com</a> seems a bit desperate, somewhere to go if you're after an Argos ring posing as Tiffany's. <a href=\"http://www.fling.com\">Fling.com</a> is plain seedy, judging by the bits of lower body magnified on the homepage. And the name. </p> <p>Then there's the lady at nan's bingo hall who went on an online dating site and was found dismembered in a wood in the next county. \"She was nimble for 50, as well,\" said nan.</p> <p>On reflection, I plump for see-it-all-upfront speed dating.</p> <p>Seasoned speeders say it's all about selection. Speed dating in Clerkenwell, with tie and cuff-link wearers who throw in the odd four-syllable word, is probably quite different to, say, speeding in Deptford. </p> <p>When you've decided on the location, you've got to think about what to drink. How to drink it. What not to say. How not to say it.</p> <p>There's a nasty three-question frame that novice speeders slip into:</p> <p>1. What's your name?<br>2. Where are you from?<br>3. What do you do?</p> <p>You'd learn more about him by smelling his left sock, blindfolded. </p> <p>More damaging than the three-point frame are the three traits you should never reveal when you're speeding.</p> <p>The first is sarcasm. \"I'm going to ask you something different,\" Number Six tells me. \"What's your favourite food?\" </p> <p>I feel as sophisticated as a stickle brick. But at least it's easier than the three-minute Marxism banter with Number Five. So I say: \"Asparagus and lemon risotto with a slosh of taleggio cheese.\" </p> <p>He looks a bit glum. \"I despise Italian,\" he says. </p> <p>I'll push it a bit, I think. I'll show him my loveable dry humour. So I say: \"Clearly we're not compatible then.\" </p> <p>Number Six doesn't laugh or wink or pretend to understand my sarcasm. \"Ok, I wanted to get a drink anyway.\" He turns and walks to the bar. </p> <p>My next big error is with Number 11, to whom I reveal my dark wit. At first, we're getting on quite well - perhaps because I steer clear of contentious rice dishes and he smiles a lot. We talk about Bristol: the Old Vic and Browns Brasserie and the four-foot high books in the law library. </p> <p>Then I get a bit carried away. I don't hear the bell ring. I don't hear everyone stop talking and prepare to move to the next date. It's completely silent as I say: \"Isn't Bristol best at everything? Even the Clifton suspension bridge is best for suicide.\" </p> <p>Silence. I carry on: \"There are these posters from the Samaritans on the bridge. As if that would stop you if you were halfway over the edge and braced for the mudflats.\" </p> <p>I finally hear the silence. He picks up his pencil to mark my card. With a cross.</p> <p>The third fatal trait is naivety. After the last bell, two girls grabbed two men by their crotches and led them out to taxis. They honestly did. And there was some hushed, suggestive talk going on around one table followed by tinkly giggling. </p> <p>Speed dating - it's not the place for sarcasm, humour or contemplation. It's simple, shallow and sleazy.</p>",
  "<p>The difficulty with droughts is that they can turn to floods overnight. The difficulty with rain, or acute lack of it, when tied into the prophesies of global warming, is that the short-term can turn from arid to soggy in a trice. Which is part, but not all, of the Spanish story.</p> <p>Remember Britain in the summer of 2006? It was hot and dry, after a dry winter and dry spring \u2013 and the water began to run out. The spectre of standpipes stalked the streets of the south again. Thames Water, as usual, took a mighty leakage drubbing: and we were copiously advised that there would be worse to come as climates inexorably changed. But then 2007 was a sodden ordeal and the aquifers filled up again. Now, in 2008, we're wailing about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/aug/12/weather.flooding?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront\">lousiest August</a> any of us can remember.</p> <p>Now turn to <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/spains-drought-a-glimpse-of-our-future-833587.html\">Catalonia this spring</a>. There'd been precious little snow on the Pyrenees, so rivers like the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ter_River\">Ter</a> were low. When I went to see my Spanish grandchildren near La Bisbal, the river bed was absolutely dry. In Barcelona the mayor was signalling water rationing and calling for tankers to bring relief into port. It couldn't have looked more threatening. And then it rained.</p> <p>Now the apples are ripening in the <a href=\"http://www.barcelona.com/barcelona_city_guide/catalonia/costa_brava/baix_emporda/\">Baix Emporda</a> and the yellow fields of sunflowers stretch endlessly. The Ter is half full, the land is surprisingly green, the champion golf courses lush and tended. All it takes is a couple of weeks of downpours to move us from crisis to complacency. But complacency, here, is a fatal state of mind.</p> <p>Catalonia, with its high plateaux and mountain ranges, ought to be one of the wetter regions of Spain (as well as the richest). Andalucia ought to be one of the driest, most over-populated and over-farmed regions: and is. Andalucia is concrete and tourists and fruit and poverty. It has plunged, often heedlessly, into acute water shortage. But when water and regionalism and politics mix, everything grows toxic. Now Catalonia, which might have helped send water to the arid south, knows it has problems of its own. The rest of Spain, some of it wet like Galicia, some of it desert like the area just north of Almeria, knows that water is a most vital resource. Watch that factor into the separatist pressures in Catalonia, the Basque country and (more mildly) in Galicia. Watch water put more acute strain on the Spanish state.</p> <p>In Britain, we said two years ago, there should be a national grid, moving water from the wet north-west to the dry south-east. But that is damnable expensive, slow to build \u2013 and easy to deride if you're laying it whilst the rain pours down. (Cue Daily Mail editorial). And Spain is in much the same sort of bind \u2013 with Basque and Catalan nationalism dropped in the mix. (It's Scotland's oil and the Basque country's water!). </p> <p>We should be clear that whole areas of Europe are becoming fatally dry. We should set about either limiting water use or transporting water in from wetter areas. We should be constructing the infrastructure that can cope with crisis. But then it starts raining again: then the flood alerts start, then long-term trends turn into a heavy shower, and we forget (as Catalonia has forgotten once more this summer). But at least the Spanish have water meters as standard. At least they have some control when the skies are incessantly blue. In Britain, we haven't even got that far yet. In Britain, the arguments about climate change and threat fade fast before a looming recession; and we still don't realise that life \u2013 everything that is precious \u2013 begins and ends with the need for water.</p>",
  "<p>The disgraced former glam rocker Gary Glitter could find himself behind bars again after refusing to board a flight to London following his deportation from Vietnam after serving a jail sentence for sexually abusing children. </p> <p>The 64-year-old, whose real name is Paul Gadd, today remained in the transit lounge of Bangkok airport, where he had been due to change planes, but will be transferred to a detention centre if he continues to thwart efforts to send him back to the UK. </p> <p>\"Officials concerned are working through the process of putting him on the plane to take him out of the country, but if he continues to refuse to leave then he will be confined in the [airport transit] area temporarily before being taken into a detention centre,\" said Lieutenant General Chatchawal Suksomchit, the chief of Thailand's immigration police. </p> <p>His demands to be let into Thailand were refused by the Thai authorities, who are exercising powers to deny entry to convicted sex offenders and will not allow him past immigration. </p> <p>Travellers are allowed to spend only 12 hours in transit at the airport before they are deemed to have violated Thai immigration law. Gadd has been told he will not be allowed to leave the airport unless it is on a flight out of the country. </p> <p>He missed his connection last night, and a second flight left for London at 12.25pm local time, but Thai Airways said Gadd was not on board. It is unclear whether police will use force to put him on a plane. </p> <p>Major General Phongdej Chaiprawat, of the Thai police, said: \"He is banned from entering (Thailand) because he was jailed and he could pose a threat to domestic morality. He is a transit passenger and it is the responsibility of the airline to take him to his final destination.\" </p> <p>A Foreign Office spokesman said: \"We were last aware that he remained in transit. He decides where he applies to go and the country or authorities there will decide whether they permit him to enter their territory.\"</p> <p>It is unlikely that any south Asian country will accept Gadd. Cambodia has already blacklisted him.</p> <p>Gadd's deportation degenerated into confusion yesterday when he landed in Bangkok after a 90-minute Thai Airways flight from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, but refused to transfer to his connecting flight. </p> <p>Gadd demanded to fly to Singapore after Thai officials refused to let him into the country. </p> <p>He argued with immigration officers, insisting he had \"done his time\" and was a \"free man\", while Thai officials and British embassy staff tried to persuade him to board the London-bound plane. Then he complained of a heart ailment and booked himself into a VIP hotel within the airport. The hotel is technically international territory. This morning Gadd was refusing to check out, claiming to be unwell. </p> <p>He was released yesterday from Thu Duc prison, north of Ho Chi Minh City, after serving two years and nine months of a three-year sentence for the repeated sexual abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11. </p> <p>He had been due to arrive at Heathrow this morning, where he would have been met by police and ordered to sign the sex offenders' register. </p> <p>The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, said today that Britain could not enforce Gadd's return. A British police officer sent to escort him back to the UK admitted he had no legal jurisdiction and could only look on during yesterday's developments. </p> <p>Gadd was jailed in the UK in 1999 for downloading child pornography. On release he moved to Spain and Cuba before going to south-east Asia. </p> <p>Cambodia expelled him over alleged sex crimes and he went to the Vietnamese coastal resort of Vung Tau, where he lay low until his presence was uncovered in 2005 by British tabloid newspapers. </p> <p>The two girls he was eventually convicted of abusing initially said he had raped them \u2014 a crime which carries the death penalty \u2014 but were reportedly paid off. Gadd was arrested trying to leave Vietnam and stood trial. He pleaded not guilty, claiming he had been teaching the girls English. He was sentenced in March 2006.</p>",

PRs seed stories and releases, and journalists can pick up the stories they like and use Pitchspace to organise the material for that story. The system also ranks PRs (and, I assume, journalists!) according to the relationships they build up with journalists, so the more they work together the more contact details they get, and so on.</p> <p style=\"background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); color: #333333; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 13px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; : ; : #000000; : 1; : #FFFFFF; : #000000; : 1; : ; : ; : ; : auto; : #000000; : 1; : ; : auto; : auto; : ; : ; : 4; : 1; : auto; : auto; : baseline; : auto; : start; : ; : auto;\">This is very early stage, but an idea that is worth getting out there for discussion before the beta version launches so that the guys can refine what they are doing.</p> <p style=\"background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); color: #333333; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 13px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; : ; : #000000; : 1; : #FFFFFF; : #000000; : 1; : ; : ; : ; : auto; : #000000; : 1; : ; : auto; : auto; : ; : ; : 4; : 1; : auto; : auto; : baseline; : auto; : start; : ; : auto;\">From a journalist's point of view, the appeal is crucially that this means bypassing cursed email. If the Pitchspace feeds can be organised in an RSS reader, that would overcome the problem of having to integrate yet another piece of software into my daily news process. On the other hand, it's a system that has no way of capturing the most valuable leads - off record, late night and confidential - and I'm not clear how you could negotiate anything exclusive on here either.</p> <p style=\"background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); color: #333333; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 13px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; : ; : #000000; : 1; : #FFFFFF; : #000000; : 1; : ; : ; : ; : auto; : #000000; : 1; : ; : auto; : auto; : ; : ; : 4; : 1; : auto; : auto; : baseline; : auto; : start; : ; : auto;\">From a PR point of view, it's another outlet for reaching journalists, so the appeal would be in the volume of writers that use it. But perhaps I'll let the PRs themselves weigh in on that side of things.</p> <p style=\"background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); color: #333333; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 13px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; : ; : #000000; : 1; : #FFFFFF; : #000000; : 1; : ; : ; : ; : auto; : #000000; : 1; : ; : auto; : auto; : ; : ; : 4; : 1; : auto; : auto; : baseline; : auto; : start; : ; : auto;\"><strong>I'm prepared to be generous with this idea and this project, even though this is very early days, because they are tackling some very interesting ideas here</strong>: email is broken. Incredibly inefficient, untargeted, abused. If they can devise a system that communicates information more efficiently - using what we have learnt from Twitter - we could all benefit.</p> <p style=\"background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); color: #333333; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 13px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; : ; : #000000; : 1; : #FFFFFF; : #000000; : 1; : ; : ; : ; : auto; : #000000; : 1; : ; : auto; : auto; : ; : ; : 4; : 1; : auto; : auto; : baseline; : auto; : start; : ; : auto;\">Secondly, the idea of wrapping reputation management around direct professional relationships is very interesting. (Until someone gets bombed, but let's not think about that yet...).</p> <p style=\"background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); color: #333333; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 13px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; : ; : #000000; : 1; : #FFFFFF; : #000000; : 1; : ; : ; : ; : auto; : #000000; : 1; : ; : auto; : auto; : ; : ; : 4; : 1; : auto; : auto; : baseline; : auto; : start; : ; : auto;\">Thirdly, there's the more nascent idea of content management in here, a sort of Basecamp-style store for stories in development. Again, on a website (and this is just the MediaGuardian) with a turnaround of 30 news stories and 15 blog posts a day (not to mention podcasts, video and extra stories first published in the paper) - building up a project portofolio is aluxury of time we just don't have.</p> <p style=\"background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); color: #333333; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 13px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; : ; : #000000; : 1; : #FFFFFF; : #000000; : 1; : ; : ; : ; : auto; : #000000; : 1; : ; : auto; : auto; : ; : ; : 4; : 1; : auto; : auto; : baseline; : auto; : start; : ; : auto;\">This follows some of <strong><a href=\"http://scobleizer.com/2008/08/13/pr/\">Robert Scoble</a></strong>'s recent rants that PR is dead, <strong><a href=\"http://www.micropersuasion.com/2008/08/does-the-thrill.html\">Steve Rubel</a></strong> noting that a lot of journalists prefer digging out stories themselves and a great piece by <strong><a href=\"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/does_good_tech_need_pr.php\">ReadWriteWeb</a></strong> on the pros and cons of PR.

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-336781611\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p><br>Nicolas Sarkozy made a brief visit to Afghanistan today after the French army's worst loss of life by enemy attack in a quarter of a century.</p> <p>The French president spoke to troops from units that lost 10 men in the mountain battle about 30 miles east of Kabul on Monday. </p> <p>Sarkozy said he had no regrets about sending more troops to the region earlier this year, despite the political firestorm that has broken out in France since Monday's ambush.</p> <p>\"I have no doubt that we must be here. I am also in shock \u2026 but I tell you in good conscience that if we had to do it again, I would do it again,\" he said, according to AFP.</p> <p>\"Not the patrol and the sequence of events, but the choice which led me to confirm the decision of my predecessors to send the French army here.</p> <p>\"Why are we here? It is because here we play a part in the freedom of the world. Here we are fighting against terrorism.\"</p> <p>London-based security thinktank the Senlis Council said western governments were \"in denial\" about the extent of the Taliban danger around Kabul. It said more troops needed to be deployed to secure the capital.</p> <p>\"Today, western leaders must ask themselves why their policies have failed,\" the group said in a statement. \"Without urgent troop redeployment, attacks in and around Kabul are likely to be stepped up. With the Taliban on the very doorstep of the Afghan capital, the situation can only get worse for Nato-Isaf forces, and for the Afghan people.\"</p> <p>During his five-hour trip to the country, Sarkozy met with the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai. </p> <p>Karzai has said violence is on the rise in his country because of the lack of attention Nato and Afghanistan have paid to militant sanctuaries and training grounds - a clear reference to Pakistan's tribal area.</p> <p>The French soldiers were on a patrol when they were ambushed by a force of about 100 militants in the mountains of Surobi. France's top military official, General Jean-Louis Georgelin, said most of the French casualties came in the minutes after the soldiers ascended a mountain pass.</p> <p>The French defence minister, Herve Morin, said about 30 militants were killed and 30 wounded. Taliban fighters and militants allied to the renegade warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar operate in Surobi.</p> <p>It was the deadliest attack on French troops since a bombing in Lebanon in 1983. The bodies of those who died are expected to be repatriated today.</p> <p>Sarkozy boarded a plane for Afghanistan shortly after the deaths were announced, breaking away again from his holiday in the south of France. He had already interrupted his summer break to deal with the crisis between Russia and Georgia.</p> <p>Militants in Afghanistan are traditionally more active in summer, and are showing greater determination to confront US and Nato troops in their attempt to wrest back the control the Taliban lost nearly seven years ago.</p> <p>Sarkozy's government faced its first vote of no confidence earlier this year when Sarkozy's move to send 700 extra troops to Afghanistan was greeted with dismay by the opposition and members of his own rightwing party.</p> <p>The deaths have been used by the opposition Socialist party to highlight its call for a national debate. \"What are the aims of this war? How many troops must there be to reach its stated objectives?\" said a statement from the party leader, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.</p> <p>There are around 2,600 French troops in Afghanistan.</p>",
  "<p>NBC Universal has made its first move into UK independent production by snapping up Carnival, the company behind Harley Street and Hotel Babylon, for up to \u00a330m. </p> <p>The acquisition is part of a new strategy by the US network and Hollywood studio business to move into production outside America.</p> <p>Under the agreement, NBC will take 100% control of Carnival and merge it into its international TV production division, headed by president Angela Bromstad. </p> <p>The deal covers Carnival's back catalogue, which includes ITV dramas including Poirot, Jeeves and Wooster and Rosemary and Thyme. </p> <p>Carnival is currently owned by Australian company Southern Star and the company's chief executive officer, Gareth Neame, who joined Carnival from the BBC in 2004.</p> <p>NBC Universal said Southern Star's 75% stake, together with its library of Carnival programming, was worth between \u00a320m and \u00a322m, although it would not comment on the full cost of the deal. Industry estimates have put it at up to \u00a330m. </p> <p>NBC Universal is one of the biggest US media and entertainment companies, operating channels including the NBC broadcast network and cable services such as USA, Bravo, Sci-Fi and Oxygen.</p> <p>The company also owns the Universal Hollywood film studio and a TV production operation that makes shows including House, Battlestar Galatica, Law &amp; Order and NBC's US version of The Office.</p> <p>There has been speculation for some time that Carnival was up for sale, with BBC Worldwide and ITV thought to be interested.</p> <p>Neame said: \"I am excited to bring the company into the global brand that is NBC Universal under this groundbreaking deal, which offers great strategic opportunities for Carnival and all the talent who work with us. </p> <p>\"As a unique production model in the UK, I believe we will have so much to bring to our broadcaster relationships and the creative community. Equally, as a production base for NBC Universal outside of north America, we will be an important asset for our new parent.\"</p> <p>NBC Universal's move into the UK production market is likely to raise eyebrows at the BBC and ITV - both of which have been keen to snap up stakes in independent producers themselves. </p> <p>The US giant has already made forays into the UK, with the purchase of Hallmark Channel owner Sparrowhawk Media.</p> <p>NBC Universal wants to more than double non-US revenue by 2010 and its international acquisitions include a 26% share of NDTV Networks in India. </p> <p>Jeff Zucker, the president and chief executive of NBC Universal, said: \"International growth is one of our key strategic priorities, and that includes boosting our ability to create programming for specific local audiences around the world. This acquisition will jump-start our efforts in the very important UK market.\"</p> <p>Carnival will be managed by Bromstad in London. She said: \"Carnival is a highly respected TV production operation and we are delighted to welcome them into the NBC Universal fold.\"</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>These are the main findings in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/20/baa.theairlineindustry\">Competition Commission's (CC) report on BAA's ownership of UK airports</a>, published this morning.</p> <p>:: Common ownership of Edinburgh and Glasgow airports is a feature which prevents competition between them;</p> <p>:: Common ownership of the three BAA London airports is a feature of the market which prevents competition between them;</p> <p>:: Heathrow's position as the only significant hub airport in south east England, and indeed the UK, is a feature which restricts competition between airports for some airlines;</p> <p>:: Common ownership of Southampton and both Heathrow and Gatwick is a feature of the market which prevents competition between them, as shown in particular by the lack of responsiveness of BAA to developing Southampton to satisfy the requirements of its airline customers;</p> <p>:: Common ownership of the BAA London airports further restricts competition between airports through its effects on capacity constraints and exacerbates the inadequacies of the regulatory system, reducing the benefit of regulation and distorting competition between airlines;</p> <p>:: Aberdeen's comparatively isolated geographical position relative to other centres of population, combined with other general factors that make it unattractive to serve a catchment of Aberdeen's size with more than one airport and so deter entry, are features that restrict airport competition;</p> <p>:: Aspects of planning restrictions are features which restrict competition by contributing to the current capacity constraints at the BAA London airports;</p> <p>:: Aspects of Government policy restrict or distort competition by contributing to the current capacity constraints at the BAA London airports;</p> <p>:: The current system of regulation of airports is also a feature which distorts competition between airlines;</p> <p>:: The commission proposes the divestiture of either Glasgow or Edinburgh airport and seeks views on this;</p> <p>:: Aberdeen's strong local monopoly position would not be solved by divestiture so views are sought on what other measures might be appropriate, such as behavioural undertakings or regulation;</p> <p>:: The CC proposes the divestiture of two of BAA's London airports (Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted). Views are invited on which would provide the most effective solution, including whether there are likely to be any obstacles in finding suitable purchasers;</p> <p>:: However, the CC's guidelines mean that it is unlikely to require the divestiture of Heathrow unless the sale of Gatwick or Stansted is likely to be impractical or ineffective;</p> <p>:: The CC is not proposing divestiture of Southampton airport, as sale of London airports would address concerns about Southampton;</p> <p>:: The CC considers it likely that (economic) regulation (by the Civil Aviation Authority) of Gatwick and Stansted will still be required for some time while capacity continues to restrain competition. Heathrow is likely to require continued regulation for a prolonged period given its role as the main hub airport;</p> <p>:: The system of regulation and the role of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) should be reviewed with the aim of making regulation more effective without becoming more intrusive by adopting some of the processes used in other regulated sectors;</p> <p>:: This could include imposing significant obligations on airport operators as conditions of an economic licence such as standards of service, financial adequacy, ring-fencing and accounting separation, change of control provisions and conditions for revoking the licence and appointing a special administrator;</p> <p>:: The Government should review the 2003 aviation White Paper with a view to considering its impact on competition particularly in the light of separate ownership of London airports.</p>",
  "<p>Jacqui Smith today announced that convicted paedophiles could be subject to much stricter movement controls.</p> <p>The changes to the rules include increasing the length of time child-sex offenders can be banned from travelling abroad and making it easier for the police to obtain orders curbing activities in the UK. </p> <p>Ministers are also considering increasing the age limit to 18 for youngsters deemed at risk when travel restrictions are being sought.</p> <p>Legislation will be brought forward shortly to introduce new powers where necessary. </p> <p>Children's campaigners welcomed the measures, announced as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/aug/20/childprotection\">Gary Glitter</a>, the former pop star, was released from a Vietnamese jail after serving two years and nine months for abusing two girls. </p> <p>The latest moves follow talks with police and the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Agency (CEOP). </p> <p>Smith announced today that the length of foreign travel orders for paedophiles would be increased from six months to up to five years. </p> <p>The requirement on police seeking sexual-offences prevention orders to provide evidence from the last six months will also be removed. </p> <p>Those subject to blanket travel bans will also have their passports automatically confiscated. </p> <p>There will also be a consultation on further restrictions on the validity of paedophiles' passports and their issuance. </p> <p>Foreign travel orders may also be available where children under 18, rather than under 16 at present, are in danger. </p> <p>Smith, the home secretary, said: \"The UK has a rigorous system in place for managing child sex offenders which is among the toughest in the world. </p> <p>\"The changes I'm announcing today will strengthen that even further. I want to see anyone who poses a threat to our children dealt with as firmly as possible. </p> <p>\"I've spoken to child protection experts and the police and they have told me that these changes will further restrict the ability of child-sex offenders to harm children both here and overseas. </p> <p>\"I will legislate for these measures as soon as possible.\" </p> <p>NSPCC policy advisor Zoe Hilton said: \"These measures are a crucial step forward and should help clamp down on sex tourism. </p> <p>\"We have been consistently saying that when there is clear evidence a sex offender poses a risk, the authorities must have effective powers to stop them from going abroad. </p> <p>\"But if they do travel there must be better systems in place to monitor and track their movements. </p> <p>\"The UK government has a crucial role to play in working more closely with other governments and police to keep sex offenders on the radar and bring those who commit sexual crimes against children to justice.\" </p> <p>Catheryn Henchion, safeguarding officer at children's charity NCH, said: \"These moves will help protect vulnerable children around the world from coming to harm at the hands of abusers. </p> <p>\"It is essential that we work as an international community to reach a point where there are no safe havens for those abusers and thus ensuring that a child, no matter where they are growing up, can be as safe as possible.\"</p> <p>Commenting on the case of Glitter - whose real name is Paul Gadd - Smith said his was the type of situation where it was \"pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again\". </p> <p>She told GMTV: \"I don't want any sex offenders in this country, but the point is, Vietnamese officials have deported him to the UK, so, as we do whenever sex offenders return to this country, we need to plan ... for what happens when people return.\" </p> <p>She added: \"Never mind his individual case, anybody who is returning to the UK in these sorts of circumstances would be met at the airport by police officers, would be served with an order which effectively puts them on to the sex offenders register.\"</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Great Britain has won Olympic golds in the Swimming, the Cycling, the Rowing, the Athletics, and the Gadding About On Daddy's Yacht.</strong> It's a wonderful achievement, if a strangely disconcerting one; we're simply not used to all this success. It feels odd. What the country <em>really</em> needs is a gaggle of inept jokers to hove into view and reacquaint everyone with the comforting feeling of incredulous misery. I don't need to insult your intelligence by drawing this paragraph to a close, do I.</p> <p><strong>The match kicks off at 8pm.</strong> And it's gonna be a lot of fun, especially as I'm going to try to watch as much of Scotland's debacle against Northern Ireland as I possibly can while reporting on this England waste of time. That's just the way it's got to be. See you around 7pm for the team news and what promises to be an hour of feeble and inconsistently updated chit-chat.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Jermaine Defoe is in the England team:</strong> James, Brown, A Cole, Ferdinand, Terry (Captain), Beckham, Barry, Lampard, Gerrard, Defoe, Rooney.<br>Subs: Robinson, Hart, Johnson, Bridge, Woodgate, Upson, Bentley, Downing, Jenas, Joe Cole, Heskey, Walcott.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>The Scotland side facing Northern Ireland:</strong> Gordon, Alexander, McManus, Weir, Naysmith, Brown, Thomson, Fletcher, Morrison, Miller, McFadden.<br>Subs: McGregor, Marshall, Whittaker, Robson, Commons, Berra, Barr, Boyd, Steven Fletcher, Stewart, Clarkson.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>The Republic of Ireland were one up in Norway through a Robbie Keane scuff, but Tromso defender Tore Reginiussen has just equalised with half an hour to play.</strong> It's a struggle trying to watch the game develop, though, because on the next screen previewing the England game is a very open-shirted and perma-tanned Terry Venables. The volume is down, he's waving his hands around, I'm not great at lip-reading but I think he's just used the phrase \"But this is what I'm saying\". Wide-open collar, tan, barstool philosophy... he couldn't be more old-school cockney if he was swaggering around with a large scotch and a shooter telling everyone he loves his old ma.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>This Ireland match is preposterous.</strong> The pitch is totally waterlogged, the ball keeps stopping in puddles. It's nearly as bad as Switzerland v Turkey back there at Euro 2008. Ah, Euro 2008. A fine championship. Why was that, again?</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>The Northern Ireland team playing at Hampden:</strong> Taylor, McAuley, Evans, Craigan, McGivern, Baird, Clingan, Davis, Brunt, Healy, Paterson.<br>Subs: Mannus, Duff, O'Connor, Shiels, Feeney.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>NOBODY on Setanta is wearing a tie. Not Venables, not Arry Redknapp, not Steve McManaman, not presenter Angus Forgottensurname, not <em>anybody</em>.</strong> Come on, for goodness sake, make the effort, will you? This is an international, and you're on the telly. Nobody can see me and I'm sat here respectfully sporting top hat and tails.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>The Czech team:</strong> Cech, Grygera, Ujfalusi, Rozehnal, Jankulovski, Vlcek, Kovac, Polak, Plasil, Sirl, Baros.<br>Subs: Zitka, Kadlec, Pospech, Jarolim, Rajnoch, Papadopulos, Sverkos.</p> <p><strong>The referee:</strong> Terje Hauge (Norway) </p> <p><strong>And the result in Norway:</strong> The Republic of Ireland have drawn 1-1.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>The national anthems at Wembley...</strong> are being played in the style of Mantovani. It's a very laid-back affair.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>And we're off!</strong> Both teams take a turn to stroke it around for a while, but there's nothing much going on.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Rooney is hauled down 40 yards out. Beckham, starting for the 99th time tonight, loops a free kick into the box in the general direction of Defoe, but Cech comes out to punch clear. Lampard attempts to send it back goalwards but only succeeds in shanking it out of play.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Gerrard picks the ball up on the left and cuts inside. He's 30 yards out, but that's not going to stop him, is it? He sends a daisycutter towards the bottom-left corner of the goal, but Cech gets down easily to save.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> A brilliant run from Jinking Genius James McFadden, who Maradonas through the Northern Ireland defence and is only stopped from replicating Diego's goal against Belgium in the 1986 World Cup semi by a last-ditch challenge from some Irish spoilsport or other. Back in the non-event, Beckham scoots down the right but his cross is nearly as aimless as this match.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> Barry is booked for a disgraceful lunge on Plasil, who feels his opponent's studs on his ankle and stays down awhile. He eventually limps gingerly to the touchline in what appears to be some very real pain.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Baros chases a long punt down the inside right channel. Ferdinand is in close attendance, but he can't stop the Czech getting a low fizzing shot in which James does well to palm clear. Brown is covering, which is just as well because Plasil - who is back on - was sniffing around.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> Free kick to England, just to the left of the Czech box. Beckham shanks it into the crowd, a complete anti-climax. Time for a bit of juxtaposition. \"Who is the most overrated player in the current England squad?\" asks Marie Meyer. \"My vote goes to Wayne Rooney, with Frank Lampard as a close second.\"</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>21 min: GOAL!!! England 0-1 Czech Republic.</strong> Great work from Sirl down the left, who twists and turns, then rolls the ball into the centre where Baros has his back to goal. England's Brave John Terry attempts to deal with it by holding onto the back of Baros's shirt with both of his frustrated fists. This tactic doesn't deal with it, though. What happens next is this: Baros turns ridiculously easily and sends off a shot which takes a deflection off Ashley Cole, up and over James. That's a great goal from the Czech's point of view, and absolutely terrible defending by England. Especially by Terry. What was Marie Meyer asking, again?</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>25 min: </strong> It is absolutely <em>tipping</em> down at Wembley. Defoe takes a lash from the edge of the area but Cech plucks it out of the air with studied insouciance.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>29 min: </strong> Sirl nearly rushes free again, but Brown does well to hold him up, while Ferdinand covers Baros, for a while free in the centre, screaming for the ball. \"There is something about Wembley which seems to inspire visiting teams,\" suggests Setanta commentator Jon Champion, possibly referring to the grandeur of the stadium, or maybe the fact that England always shamble around in it.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>32 min: </strong> Kovac takes a wild swipe from 30 yards. It's high, wide and hopeless. But the Czechs are repeatedly swarming forward, with little or no resistance in midfield from England. This is a very poor show. \"If England come second today, will they get a silver?\" asks Mac Millings \"If so, you'll get excitement from readers like me, who expected them to finish out of the medals.\" England do indeed currently look capable of coming fourth in a field of two, it's that bad.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>35 min: </strong> Gerrard takes a wild flay from 30 yards. It's not great, but least he's been continually involved, something only Rooney and Beckham can also say. Where's Frank?</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>38 min: </strong> Cech is forced to parry a fierce Defoe drive. That's a corner. From it, Beckham's witless delivery is easily swept up by Ujfalusi, who sets Baros scampering off down the park. Barry does well to hold the striker up and what looked like a dangerous break is over.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>40 min: BREAKING NEWS, SHOULD YOU CARE...</strong> Brian Barwick, the man who gave the England job to Steve McClaren, is to leave his post as Head Suit of the FA at the end of the year. Presumably he will then be chased away from Soho Square by men wielding pointed sticks, then slapped with a restraining order ensuring the bugger can't come back.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> This has been car-crash stuff from England, so much so I've not watched much of the Scotland-Northern Ireland game, which was my initial intention. Bah. Jankulovski lifts a free kick into the English area from the left, but James does well to come and claim the high ball. \"Is that really the best team in the country?\" splutters Peter Gregory. No. \"Good grief! I guess at least the FA is in no danger of shelling out the bonus for Capello to guide them to a World Cup win.\" Yes, that must be the most worthless clause in the history of legal contracts.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>44 min: GOAL!!! England 1-1 Czech Republic.</strong> A goal at a corner! Whatever next? Beckham whips in a delicious ball from the right, Brown heads powerfully home from six yards.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Half time: England 1-1 Czech Republic.</strong> That wasn't very impressive by England at all, but they've scrambled back to level terms and things can only get better, surely. <em>Surely.</em> It's also all-square at Hampden, where neither Scotland nor Northern Ireland have scored. Nicholas Clifton is of the opinion that England being fourth in a field of two represents \"a great improvement on the McClaren era\".</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>HAA (Half-time Acronym Amusement) with Marie Meyer:</strong> \"If instead of England's Brave John Terry you make it England's Inspirational John Terry, you get EIJT. Sound it out, I think you'll like it.\"</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>The effect of Brian Barwick, crystallised:</strong> \"The timing may just be coincidence,\" writes Kanga Roo, \"but Brian Barwick must feel awful. It only took four minutes for things to get better after the announcement.\"</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>Our Becks, Their Becks, Everybody's Becks:</strong> \"Beckham's improvement in form tonight is undoubtedly due to his intense work with the national team coach,\" writes Mike Wilner, straight man in Los Angeles comedy duo Mike Wilner and Mike Wilner. \"That would be Bruce Arena,\" adds his quipster sidekick Mike Wilner, \"the former USA gaffer who took over the LA Galaxy from Ruud Gullit this week, not Sir Fabio. Can't argue with the results.\"</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>And we're off again!</strong> Heskey has replaced Defoe. The Czechs have made three changes, two of which I missed. Baros is off for Sverkos. Kovac nearly starts the half with a bang, his shot from the edge of the area only just going wide of the left-hand post.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>47 min: GOAL!!! England 1-2 Czech Republic.</strong> England are useless. The centre of their defence gets ripped in two by a lovely back flick from Polak which nearly frees Sverkos. Ferdinand does well to block the shot, but Barry - who has been booked and wants to watch himself - hacks down Polak right on the edge of the area. Free kick. It's curled exquisitely into the top left corner, past a static James, by Jankulovski. You will struggle to see a better free kick all season. England are woeful at the back, though. Come back Brian Barwick, all is forgiven.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> Gerrard makes a powerful run into the Czech area from the left, but he's never quite in control of the ball and hustled out of it easily enough. To say that this was one of England's stand-out moments illustrates the paucity of wit in their play. England are <em>hopeless</em>. They really shouldn't be this bad. Cigar sales in Croatia must have doubled in the last hour or so.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> Heskey's career in microcosm, right here. Rooney picks up the ball and drives into the Czech half. Heskey makes a wonderful diagonal run into space and receives the ball from Rooney, only to clunk up a 10lb divot of turf and send the ball sailing goalwards at a speed of nearly 1mph. Dear me. \"I'm surprised England are struggling what with EBJT's huge personality,\" writes Dan Bear. \"Maybe his personality should play up front to add some height. To be fair he probably has the biggest personality in the England team - which is a bit like being the best actor in Hollyoaks.\"</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> Gerrard - who might have picked up a minor knock - and Ferdinand are replaced by Woodgate and Joe Cole. Ryan McGivern has been sent off for Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, speaking of other matches, Rhys Henderson is here to do my job for me. \"By the way, Wales - you remember, that other member of the UK - are leading 1-0. Thought you'd be interested seeing that you're following England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and even mentioned the Republic of Ireland. I know it's not your fault - I reckon it's Guardian policy!\" Sorry about that, Rhys; I've only got two televisions. And have gone boss-eyed. Any chance of keeping me posted?</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>60 min: MAJESTIC CLOWNING FROM DAVID JAMES.</strong> He races miles out of his area to his right wing to fetch the ball. Problem is, Sverkos is haring down the Czech left and gets there first, rounds the mobile clown, and bares down on goal. He should hammer home into an empty net, but slices his shot wide and into the side netting. That should have been a third goal for the Czech Republic. England are utterly dreadful.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Ashley Cole wins a free kick out by the corner flag on the left. There is to be no repeat of Beckham's fine delivery just before half time; Ujfalusi clears with ease.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> England are enjoying a lot of the ball but doing very little with it. \"Who would have thought?\" wonders Andy Bradshaw, \"You play the same team that did so badly in the 2008 qualifiers and they play just as badly as they did before. It's amazing.\"</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>67 min:</strong> Just wonderful football from the Czechs. Plasil and Sverkos exchange passes twice down the right. Beckham, Brown and Woodgate slide around the floor in the manner of Billy Wright against Hungary in 1953. This is embarrassingly dreadful defending, but the Czechs don't care. Sverkos gains half a yard on Woodgate and powers into the England box, James doing well to smother a low, hard shot at the second attempt.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Rooney is replaced by Downing. He can't get off the pitch quickly enough.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> The boos are ringing round Wembley. There are a lot of people who have the funk on. And no wonder, this is truly dismal from an England point of view. At least they're not being held at home by ten-man Northern Ireland, I guess.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Some Czech changes: Kadlec and Rajnoch come on, Sirl and Kovac do one. Just under 70,000 spectators are witnessing this drivel. \"Does this game perhaps indicate that McClown wasn't actually that bad, and it is actually the English players who are pants, not necessarily their manager?\" wonders Ronan Hayes, not unreasonably, nor inaccurately.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> Heskey is clattered in his face by a shot from Brown. He perhaps shouldn't have been lying on the floor at the time. \"On the plus side, at least this rabble are a swift riposte to the naysayers who reckon Britain's Olympic success is solely down to the money thrown at them,\" smiles Chris Morris through frozen teeth. \"These jokers most take home the cycling team's annual budget between them each week.\"</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Jenas comes on for Beckham. Lampard is replaced by Bentley. When Frank's number goes up, he screws up his face as though to ask \"ME? ME????\" Which is a bloody cheek, seeing he hardly touched the ball, and the few times he did saw him jigger everything up. As he sulks off, he is loudly booed by the England crowd.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Georgia have equalised against Wales. It's still 0-0 at Hampden. England are still useless.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> Downing steals a yard down the left but his cross goes right through the area and out. Slaven Bilic must be on the champagne. He <em>must</em> be.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> There are going to be four extra minutes of this. Have the Wembley masses not suffered enough?</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> A long ball into the box is won well by Heskey, who heads back to the edge of the area where Downing takes a shot. The ball flies wide right. A half-decent effort, but not one crafted with any sort of wit.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>91 min +2: THE SCRAPPIEST GOAL EVER SCORED IN THE HISTORY OF ALL FOOTBALL!!! England 2-2 Czech Republic.</strong> From a Bentley corner on the right, Heskey gets the ball to feet a yard out, then... actually, there's no point trying to describe it. Think of one of those cartoon clouds in a Beano strip, with loads of fists and legs poking out of it. Yes, that's it. Eventually the ball breaks to Joe Cole, who mishits and sends the ball bouncing apologetically through the melee and into the bottom right.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>Full time: England 2-2 Czech Republic.</strong> If anyone connected with England suggests this was anything other than a complete shapeless shambles, they should hang their heads in shame. Croatia must be like little kids waiting for Christmas Day.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>And it's all over at Hampden.</strong> George Burley's All-New Attack-Minded Scotland have failed to score against a Northern Ireland team who played the best part of half the game with ten men. And England think <em>they've</em> got problems.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>Actually, England should think they've got problems. They <em>have</em> got problems.</strong> \"Oo look,\" says Andy Bradshaw, pointing at the funny men in white shirts, \"they play pace and a team of players with points to prove and we suddenly start playing well. Who would have thought? Grumpf.\" It certainly hasn't been a good evening for Frank Lampard, who should struggle to get another cap on that showing, but probably won't. And Brian Barwick has probably had better, too. \"When will they be distributing the pointy sticks (40 min)?\" asks Will Seymour. \"I'm more than willing to fly all the way from Canada to do my part.\"</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland all draw.</strong> Wales don't, though, losing at home to Georgia and a 90th-minute Beka Gotsiridze goal. \"I'm off for a pint,\" sighs Rhys Henderson, who may now wish he hadn't pointed out our oversight.</p> <p>Email: <a href=\"mailto:scott.murray@theguardian.com\">scott.murray@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>10.38pm</strong> And it's another Jamaican gold medal - and Olympic record - Melaine Walker in 52.64 - Sheena Tosta in second place and -GET THIS! - Tasha Danvers Smith in third place with 53.84, a personal best. Wow kids we've got another medal!!!! TDS by the way put her Olympic dreams on hold to become a mum, and its' clearly paid off. So pleased for her! Now look, the mixed zone is calling, need to go and hear what birthday boy Usain is saying. Chat amongst yourselves, zaijiang.</p> <p><strong>10.35pm</strong> Oh no! Wallace has just realised he's not got a medal, disqualified! Poor lad he's gonna suffer that moment over and over on youtube. So that bumps Christian M up to 6th place, and Crawford gets the bronze instead. Meanwhile the women's 400m hurdles about to take place.</p> <p><strong>10.27pm</strong> Now the mayhem begins....from somewhere the Chinese sound system has managed to find something that sounds a bit like dancehall. Bolt's got his shoes off and is shaking his thighs and bendin down low! 'I'm number one!' he mimes to the cameras. Meanwhile Spearmon is strutting round like a right wally, giving it the boxing punches. Mate you came second, don't be bumping chests with Usain, he is the main man! Wallace is even trying to bust the dancehall moves, no no no it's just too much. For anyone wondering about the formal finish: Martina in 2nd 19.82, Spearmon 3rd in 19.95. Christian Malcolm came 7th. Now they've just played Happy Birthday to Usain (it's tomorrow).</p> <p><strong>10.24pm</strong> And he's done it! A new world record of 19.30. For everyone who said the guy took sprinting too casually, perhaps he's been reading these blogs, Bolt absolutely steamed out of his blocks and was ahead of the field after the first 20 metres. Down the home strait he pumped hard to the end, no arms flailing, puffing his cheeks out, his only concession to tomfoolery a big breaking grin as he crossed the line. Who came 2nd and third? Nobody even cares.</p> <p><strong>10.19pm</strong> I take that back, Bolt's just pretended to comb his hair down, smooth his eyebrows and shoot something into the sky. To his left is Christian Malcolm and further along Kim Collins. On his far right Walter Dix and Wallace Spearmon. Oh crikey bob it's a big one.</p> <p><strong>10.15pm</strong> AndyinBrum it's about extending opportunity not limiting it. Of course you and your family can go - and you will go, right? Meanwhile Usain Bolt is already rocking in lane 5. Licking his lips, and looking the slightest bit nervous. Maybe someone said something about showboating. Or maybe he's been watching MJ on the beeb and is worried about upsetting him with a new world record....</p> <p><strong>10.10pm</strong> BoredinOxford it may be 95% white where you live mate but in London, particularly in Stratford where the Games are being held, it certainly is not. Ethnic minority communities tend to be underprivileged economically and in terms of access to opportunities, they are also marginalised through language/history of discrimination/lack of representation all of which the white majority do - historically - hold a certain amount of responsibility for. So yes we should really get off our own arses and make sure our Games are representative. After all that is one huge premise o which we won them, no?</p> <p><strong>10.05pm</strong> Miss Felix absolutely strolled that. No wonder she stopped to don a red hairband, she was running easy enough for everyone to have time to admire it. Emily faired less well struggling to make seventh place. Jamaica now have three in the final with Sherone Simpson coming in third, and the unfortunately named Marshevet Hooker of the United States in second place. Sod all that though, we've got 13 mins to go before Bolt, well, bolts. Let's get on the bolt watch.</p> <p><strong>10.03pm</strong> Let's hope our Emily Freeman can get through this. She's in a tough semi with Felix and Roqaya Al-Gassra...</p> <p><strong>9.56pm</strong> Yep that's another JA victory with Veronica bagging first place in 22.19, followed by Kerron in 22.29.</p> <p><strong>9.53pm</strong> Women's 200m semis coming up. Veronica Campbell-Brown and Kerron Stewart will be looking for another JA 1-2 here. Alyson Felix will be along in the second of these.</p> <p><strong>9.47pm</strong> Mouth I really hope you're right. London is probably the most culturally diverse city in the world, and yet everytime I go to one of our fine (or crap) sporting venues I am met by the same faces - nearly always white and often (depending on the sport, or where the seats are) middle class. Now there's nothing wrong with that, but seeing as our Olympics will be mostly in East London it would be horrendous if this trend continued. Already I am hearing rumours that the volunteers signed up for 2012 are predominantly white. Our LOC needs to get on this and quick.</p> <p><strong>9.40pm</strong> Men's second semi-final hurdles about to start....and they're off! China's Shi Dongpeng is getting a huge roar, but he's no Liu Xiang and despite busting a good old Colin Jackson dip he's not qualified, just missing out in fifth place with 13.42, prompting a good panto 'ahhh' round the stadium.</p> <p><strong>9.33pm</strong> Dammit where's a betting shop when you need one? Dayron's through in 13.12. Meanwhile on the biting medals front, yeahyeah I get you on the gold ones, but why do they have to do it for the silvers and bronzes? Anyway Robles is my fashion hero 2008. He's got that Different World look, but what's the guy's name? Dwayne Wayne? No, I can't remember, dammit! Best ever episode was when Whitley's other half said he loved how she always woke up looking so beautiful and smelling so sweet. then the credits rolled and there was Whitley fumbling about in the dark at 6am with hair straighteners and a toothbrush. Classic.</p> <p>9.30pm Men's hurdles semis about to begin. Yes yes Dayron Robles of Cuba, not only do you have the fastest time this season but you are the man with NHS spectacles and the biggest gold cross outside of the vatican. There's a false start but my money's still on Dayron.</p> <p><strong>9.25pm</strong> I love that Brendan's worried about the Great North Run.</p> <p><strong>9.22pm</strong> They've just done the medals ceremony for the men's 1500m, now what is with that tradition of biting your medal? The gold medal winner, Rashid Ramzi, has just licked his. I think it's all a bit beyond decorum, I mean didn't their mums tell them not to lick coins? How did it all start anyway?</p> <p><strong>9.16pm</strong> Poor Mo's out of the running. Just like that. Absolutely gutted for him, you couldn't hope to meet a nicer bloke. Meanwhile the hurdles have been set up for the men's 110m hurdles semi finals. They've got a great little way of doing it here, bunch of volunteers in matching blue t-shirts, offload them off the back of a truck (hurdles not volunteers) and then all line up in a row and march off in unison. I think they've been taking tips off the US women's gymnastics team, except they haven't quite got the jazz hands figured out.</p> <p><strong>9.11pm</strong> Dougal the atmosphere is pretty good, well, anytime a Chinese athlete is competing anyway. The Brits have a terrible reputation for being partisan, but I hope we won't be quite like this come London 2012. Actually what am I saying? I am completely deluding myself. So, on the subject of pundits, who is the most jingoistic?</p> <p><strong>9.01pm</strong> Koolio, funny enough I sat next to a 'doctor' (well he said he was) at the swimming who said he could spot this sort of thing. If there weren't any libel risks I'd say let's appoint one of these guys as a regular Olympics columnist, we could have diagrams and everything.</p> <p><strong>8.58pm</strong> For anyone who hasn't already clocked (ok that's just me then) we ARE doing a live MBM blog and if you wanna see what that looks like click here: http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/20/olympics20082</p> <p><strong>8.54pm</strong> Gutted. Mo's just pulled in 6th place with a poor time of 13.50.95, well below his season's best of 13:25.01. Only the first four from each heat go through and the next three fastest so it will be a tense wait for our lad.</p> <p><strong>8.48pm</strong> There's 4,000m to go in the, erm, well, 5,000m and Mo is at the front stretching the pack, there are now four lagging behind off the main bunch of them. Let's hope he can keep it up. MichaelVaughanlover I think you're a bit harsh on our Kel. we all know she's got a big mouth, and to be honest, what a great way to use it. Everyone else is too terrified to slag off the drug users cos they are mates, or perhaps they are worried about their own habits...</p> <p><strong>8.45pm</strong> In fashion watch I can confirm that Mo is wearing his trademark non-matching trainers - one black one white. This is not a political statement on behalf of Benetton. He is simply superstitious. He is also second in the pack at the 2600m mark.</p> <p><strong>8.40pm</strong> Outoftheblue you should know by now that all the best headlines are misleading. As the tie of these postings indicates this is definitely not minute by minute. In the 2nd men's 5000m heat our Mo has just crept toward the middle of the pack and looking comfortable.</p> <p><strong>8.30pm</strong> Trust a barman to come up with the innuendoes. Zhang's had her last throw and waved goodbye to the crowd, meanwhile Yipsi Moreno of Cuba has tried it with a big final throw of 75.20 but it's not enough to bunk Miankova off her top spot. So in the medals it's a commie top 3 - 1.former communist state, 2.current communist state, 3. communist republic. (Never mix sport and politics...I can see the political corrections rolling in)</p> <p><strong>8.25pm</strong> Blimey! Miankova's just thrown a new Olympic record! 76.34. And she's the sveltest hammer thrower I've ever seen. Just goes to show you don't need an extra stomach called Bertie (Buckers take note) to throw far.</p> <p><strong>8.24pm</strong> Dothestrand, the view from the Bird's Nest doesn't quite extend to the softball game. Thank frick for that, some might say.</p> <p><strong>8.18pm</strong> News in from Kelly Sotherton. And she' not exactly upset about Blonska's potential ban...'I've been saying all along that she got caught doping when she was scoring 6300, how can she not be doping and scoring 6700? I have not seen any of her results since early June and then she comes out here and is producing good performances which was suspicious. If the B sample comes back positive then that's a life ban, which will bring an end to the saga. Hopefully she will be finished.' You tell 'em Kel.</p> <p><strong>8.10pm</strong> Lengjai I'm merely suggesting that the people's republic could do with doling out a bit of clearasil. By the way who remembers that advert, you know the one with the catchphrase everyone said at school? In athletics news, the track is getting ready for the first men's 5,000m heat - our Mo Farah's in the second - the women's hammer is on round two and I can't frickin see down to the pole vault.</p> <p><strong>8.05pm</strong> Koolio, I want more info on this bone growth spotting from a distance science. What does facial bone growth look like? I always thought Blonska looked a bit Castle of Greyskull, Skeletor and all that, especially this year. But then I attributed that to our Kel telling us that she's evil. By the way the men's pole vault is under way. Quick show of blog posts who actually likes pole vault? What's better hammer or pole?</p> <p><strong>7.52pm</strong> Mouth I agree that Johnson is far too classy to indulge in any overt gloating, but his supreme confidence exudes medals like a fat man drips sweat. Couple that with the general awed hush from the rest of the studio guests/presenters everytime he speaks and our Col ain't got a chance. Johnson doesn't even bother looking at Col when he's talking, it's like (and, ok, so I'm making this up but....) \"Gee there's some buzzing in my ear, I can't quite tell if it's a gnat or a tiny dancing Welshman...\" I do love Colin though. Especially when he says 'mam'.</p> <p><strong>7.46pm</strong> Well I didn't think that Claretti was much cop but she's just thrown her way back into contention in fourth place. Plus she wins out for hammer sex kitten of the night - a lovely bit of kohl, lippy and a good go at the hairspray, she's done herself proud. However put acne versus hairspray in a hammer fight and it's always the former that'll win out. Miss Zhang has just nailed another huge throw of 74.32.</p> <p><strong>7.42pm</strong> Angusbeefcake you are the real dark horse! Check you out with all that hammer knowledge! Do your mates know you're a big fan? Miankova is still leading the hammer pack with a whopping 74.40 throw, but yes, ol Zhang (well, she's 22), is stepping up the pressure in second place with a season's best of 74.00.</p> <p><strong>7.35pm</strong> Are any of you lot watching the telly? If so please chip in with precious punditry phrases. I'm really missing the annual Johnson vs Jackson humiliation fest - all in the name of good TV of course. Johnson always wins out by sheer medal power - like a never-ending rock, paper, scissors Micky J wins every argument with an implicit, 'yeah but how many meals you got tho?' Nuff said. And whaddoyaknow we already on heat 6 of round one of the men's 800m.</p> <p><strong>7.30pm</strong> Blimey, Clarissa Claretti of Italy has just chucked that hammer against the fence - shame! You know that error's gonna make some dreadful countdown of most embarrassing ever sporting moments. Poor old gal. That's more like it from China's Zhang Wenxiu, what a throw! She's got the whole crowd gunnign for her. She's also got really bad acne, is that mean to say?</p> <p><strong>7.22pm</strong> The women's hammer throw is about to start, hold onto your household tools. Unfortunately our best Brit chucker didn't make the final, so please state your alternative partisan ties now and I shall keep you up to date with the favourites. Aksana Miankova of Belarus is looking like the hot shot in this competition with an almighty throw of 77.32. Jeez louise. It'd take me a little while to run that far...</p> <p><strong>7.18pm</strong> A fine run by Michael there, he took the lead with 400m to go, then dropped down into third place but battled back to make it first across the line in a near photo finish, 1.47.61. For those interested in fashion, he was wearing a GB kit.</p> <p><strong>For</strong> anyone who doesn't want to take part in the drugs debate...Michael Rimmer's just set off in the 800m heats and with a good time this seaosn he's in with a chance...</p> <p>Ni hao from the Bird's Nest! We have an exciting athletics programme coming up, but heck, why talk about sporting prowess when we can talk about drugs? Such was the mood on the blog yesterday...and to get things off wiht a bang Lyudmila Blonska has kindly upped the stakes and supplied her own - allegedly - positive supply of steroids. Our Kel was right all along then....</p>",
  "<p>I used to work with a British-Asian woman from Cambridge. At first sight, she was as free and as liberated as any of her contemporaries at university but as time went by, she seemed increasingly depressed, spending all of her lunch breaks in long telephone conversations, often returning in tears.</p> <p>Amina (not her real name) had fallen in love with an Asian Muslim man. She was also Muslim and they both came from a similar ethnic background in Pakistan. Like so many of their generation, they were caught between Britain and Pakistan, between their parents and themselves. Amina's father refused to consent to her marriage and, as a Muslim daughter, she needed him as a \"wali\" or guardian to oversee her marriage. The local imam refused to conduct the ceremony without her father's consent and the presence of two male Muslim witnesses.</p> <p>When I met Amina she was still in love with this man but her father insisted she marry her cousin from Pakistan, who happened, rather conveniently, to be visiting England. Her father also had a heart condition and used his illness to emotionally blackmail her. Eventually Amina gave way. She sacrificed love to south Asian culture and married Mr Pakistan.</p> <p>White, liberal eyes reading this article will be astounded to know these things happen in Britain. I am sorry, but they do. And it gets worse.</p> <p>Amina was repeatedly raped by Mr Pakistan, but her mother told her that a Muslim man has such rights over his wife, and in Islam there is no such thing as marital rape. </p> <p>I wanted to help Amina. I suggested she divorce her husband and marry her true love but she told me her husband would kill her if she even mentioned divorce. Eventually, she risked everything and escaped to a women's refuge. When she asked for a divorce her husband refused and was supported in this by the <a href=\"http://www.islamic-sharia.org/\">Islamic Shariah Council</a>, a powerful <a href=\"http://www.islamic-sharia.org/about-us/about-us-4.html\">all-male outfit</a> controlling women's lives. </p> <p>In the light of Amina's struggle, I was pleased to read Samia Rahman's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/08/religion.islam\">article on Cif</a> about a new <a href=\"http://www.muslimparliament.org.uk/Documentation/Muslim%20Marriage%20Contract.pdf\">Muslim marriage contract</a> pioneered by the <a href=\"http://musliminstitute.org/\">Muslim Institute</a> and endorsed, much to my surprise, by the <a href=\"http://www.mcb.org.uk/\">Muslim Council of Britain</a> (MCB) and the men who supported Amina's husband: the <a href=\"http://www.islamic-sharia.org/\">Islamic Shariah Council</a>. </p> <p>Launching it at a <a href=\"http://www.thecitycircle.com/events_full_text2.php?id=521\">meeting of the City Circle</a>, Dr Ghayasuddin Siddiqui highlighted <a hef=\"http://www.thecitycircle.com/blog2.php?cann_id=722\">other cases</a> of marital abuse among Britain's Muslims Amina was not alone.</p> <p>The new Muslim marriage contract sought to update and develop fiqh, or Muslim personal jurisprudence, by shifting the power balance in a marriage to empower women to trigger divorce, feel safe from rape or abuse, prevent husbands from taking second wives, and set up accommodation separated from a husband's parents.</p> <p>All common sense, one would have thought. It went further. Witnesses at wedding ceremonies could be women and even non-Muslim, since the Qur'an is gender and faith neutral on this issue. And a Muslim woman does not need a wali, or male guardian (based on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanafi\">Hanafi</a> school of Islamic law, to which the majority of Britain's Muslims adhere).</p> <p>Had Amina and her husband signed this contract, she would have had every right to escape her miserable marriage, or even marry her first love. For those who need scriptural justification for every step of their life, the Muslim scholars behind this contract provided evidence and shariah-based arguments. </p> <p>It was all too good to be true. Misogynist, Saudi-trained clerics don't simply stand by and watch their last grip over Muslim family life slip away so easily. First, as expected, came an Arab male cleric with extreme <a hef=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabi\">Wahhabi</a> leanings, denouncing the contract as kufr, or non-belief. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGRA252Y9BU\">His rant</a> can be watched on YouTube.</p> <p>Last Friday, after initially endorsing the new contract, the MCB back-tracked and issued a <a href=\"http://www.mcb.org.uk/article_detail.php?article=announcement-734\">statement</a> to \"clarify\" is position. It spoke of \"misinterpretation of shariah by those who the MCB had trusted to take the lead\" and said: \"The MCB rejects the misguided and incorrect assertions made by and ascribed to the Muslim Institute.\"</p> <p>This MCB policy is as retrogressive and insular as its previous decision to boycott attending Holocaust Memorial Day. Then, it was the City Circle that pioneered an alternative platform for Muslims to remember the Holocaust, and again, the City Circle is ahead of the MCB in advocating an alternative reading of scripture to facilitate Muslim female power.</p> <p>And in typical MCB male arrogance, they dismiss the contract and promise to issue their own after \"due consultation\" with their \"affiliates and ulema [religious scholars]\". Why? The shariah is a diverse body of law, can't the MCB accept another interpretation? How dare they talk of \"misinterpretation\"? And why consult only clerics and affiliates, and leave out women and human rights groups?</p> <p>The MCB leadership should be ashamed of itself: ashamed for not having the balls to stand up for Muslim women, and ashamed for bowing to extremist, literalist pressure.</p> <p>When young Muslim women like Amina and thousands of others cannot trust MCB leaders to stand firm in support of the new Muslim marriage contract, its leaders should take a long look in the mirror and ask themselves: why do we always get it so terribly wrong?</p>",
  "<p><br></p> <p>Shane Meadows' new film is entirely funded by Eurostar and comes spiced with a few favourable references to the company's high-speed rail link between London and Paris. At the end of the film, it even takes a trip aboard the train itself and we are treated to a lustrous montage of Montmartre, the Eiffel Tower and the Jardin du Luxembourg. According to its makers, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf1CI5jcJJg&amp;feature=related\">Somers Town</a> is as much a pureblood Shane Meadows film as Dead Man's Shoes or This is England. But CNN describes it as \"essentially an advert\", while the Wikipedia entry defines it as a \"covert advertising campaign\".</p> <p>\"People should judge it by the fruits on the tree,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/20/advertising\">Meadows told me</a> when I spoke to him earlier this week. He argues that film-makers should always be prepared to hunt out new avenues of finance, stressing that taking money from a private company is not necessarily any more compromising than taking it from FilmFour or Pathe.</p> <p>And perhaps he has a point here. It may be that we are guilty of a widespread naivety over the way in which films are produced, blissfully unaware of the hoops that independent film-makers must jump through in order to get their hands on the cash. Their mission is to balance their creative impulse with the demands of the marketplace. In this respect they are all attempting to grow flowers (or fruit) out of manure.</p> <p>As it happens, I liked Somers Town a lot. It lacks the muscle and the ferocity of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/115242/this.is.england\">This is England</a> (alongside Control, my favourite British film from last year), and the basic story is perhaps cranked out a little past its natural length. Even so it remains a tough, tender drama from one of the UK's finest film-makers. If only those fleeting Eurostar references didn't get in the way. It's like having a really good friend who, every now and then, tries to interest you in a timeshare scheme. You have to keep a eye on it.</p> <p>While Somers Town has already played at a number of festivals, it isn't actually released in the UK until Friday. Then it will be judged by its fruit. But for now, what do make of the concept? Is it an ingenious move on Meadows' part? Or is it a worrying compromise? Is the fact that a film comes backed by one single company a cause for concern? Or is it (as producer Barnaby Spurrier argues) no more than a form of artistic patronage? Who's the organ grinder in all of this? And who's the monkey?</p>",
  "<p>Heathrow owner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/baa\">BAA</a>, which was today told it must sell two of its London airports plus one of its Scottish sites, can trace its history back more than 40 years to the early days of mass commercial air travel. But following repeated complaints of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/apr/22/theairlineindustry.travelleisure1\">poor service</a> over recent years, passengers may welcome the prospect of the company's breakup.</p> <p>BAA owes its existence to the late Roy Jenkins, who as minister for aviation introduced the airports authority bill in 1965 \u2013 which took Britain's airports out of direct government control in an attempt to make them run better and more profitably.</p> <p>This led to the creation of the British Airports Authority in 1966. It was responsible for four airports - Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Prestwick.</p> <p>As air travel grew in popularity it expanded its empire, buying Edinburgh airport from the government in 1971 and adding Aberdeen and Glasgow in 1975.</p> <p>In 1986, the Conservative government introduced the Airports Act, as part of its privatisation push. The Authority was dissolved, and its assets were transferred to a new company \u2013 BAA.</p> <p>It was then floated on the stock market in 1987, with a valuation of \u00a31.225bn.</p> <p>In 1990 it bought another UK airport, Southampton, and two years later sold Prestwick.</p> <p>Having landed a 10-year contract to run Indianapolis Airport in 1994, it expanded its international reach in 1997 with a long-term lease for Melbourne Airport. The same year it started operating the Heathrow Express rail link out of Paddington station.</p> <p>Towards the end of this decade, concern grew over BAA's monopoly position in the airport sector. The first government inquiry into the issue, in 1999, concluded that it could keep its London airports.</p> <p>But the company suffered a financial blow in 2000, when duty-free sales within the EU were abolished. It was forced to sell off several non-core assets, including retail property on Bond Street, to fund a \u00a3400m share buyback scheme.</p> <p>The September 11 2001 terrorist attacks hit the airline industry hard, knocking passenger numbers and pushing security costs permanently higher.</p> <p>In 2005, it axed hundreds of staff in a cost-cutting push. And in 2006, as pressure for a breakup intensified, BAA found itself on the end of a massive hostile takeover bid. Throughout the first half of the year, Spanish construction firm Ferrovial tussled with Goldman Sachs and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/jun/07/theairlineindustry.travelnews\">claimed its prize in June</a>.</p> <p>BAA was delisted from the stock market in August 2006, and promptly faced calls for its breakup from British Airways and Ryanair.</p> <p>Four months later, its future was plunged into uncertainty when the OFT reported that its ownership of London's airports was not giving best value to travellers.</p> <p>In March 2007, the issue was formally referred to the Competition Commission, which said back in April 2008 that breaking up BAA could deliver <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/apr/22/baa.theairlineindustry\">increased competition</a>. Today's ruling is tougher than many had expected, but with a consultation period now starting, BAA's future will remain uncertain for several more months.</p>",
  "<p>Marathon swimming is not a sport for wimps. Even the crowd need a fair degree of willpower as they stare at the empty stretch of water in front of them, awaiting a brief glimpse of the competitors every half hour or so. As live spectator attractions go it rates alongside angling, Nordic skiing and chess but the participants take deserved pride in their masochism. \"I'd quite fancy taking on Michael Phelps in this race,\" murmured Cassie Patten, one of two British medallists in a women's 10km event which, in numerous ways, proved a welcome addition to the Games schedule.</p> <p>Patten and Kerri-Ann Payne led for most of the race but had to settle for a highly creditable bronze and silver respectively in this physically draining event. \"Every part of your body is hurting,\" said Patten. \"Your stomach is the size of a pea, because all the blood rushes to your arms, your body is saying stop but your head is saying come on, keep going. The last kilometre felt like 20km - every time I looked up the finish seemed no closer.\"</p> <p>Quite aside from the determination of Patten and Payne, who led Russia's multiple open water title-holder Larisa Ilchenko until the final 250 metres, it was also impossible not to be in awe of the guts and spirit shown by South Africa's Nathalie du Toit, an amputee competing in one of the most gruelling of able-bodied Olympic events. To swim 10 kilometres around the Shunyi rowing lake is a feat in itself. To attempt it - and remain competitive - using only one leg is testing comprehension.</p> <p>People clearly underestimate Du Toit, who emerged slightly disappointed afterwards with her 16th position, having targeted a place in the top five. She is carving out an alternative career for herself as a motivational speaker and will be staying on in Beijing to compete in the Paralympics, but her opponents already insist she is one of the stars of these Games, Usain Bolt and Phelps included. \"She's an inspiration not to just to swimmers but everyone in the whole world,\" confirmed Payne, putting aside her own medal joy to salute the 24-year-old who lost her leg following a motorcycle accident in Cape Town in 2001. \"It just shows you can do what you want if you put your mind to it.\" Ilchenko felt the same way: \"I would even go as far as awarding her a separate medal. Merely looking at a person like her inspires you.\"</p> <p>It also strengthens the suspicion that open water swimming is here to stay, provided they clear the duck shit from the Serpentine in time for 2012. These ladies of the lake require not just endless supplies of stamina but a steely edge to cope with the murkier elements of their chosen discipline. Not for the first time there were post-race allegations of swimmers cynically holding each other back, with Patten enjoying a sharp exchange of views with Angela Maurer of Germany as the pair clambered from the water. </p> <p>\"You just try and stay out of trouble because sometimes the pack can be a bit rough,\" explained the Plymouth-born Patten. \"As you saw after the race there's always a bit of emotion. Things happen in races which I wouldn't do because I believe it's unsportsmanlike. But I'm not going to sit here and slag off someone. At the end of the day I've got the medal and they don't.\" Touch\u00e9.<br> The gold medallist, Ilchenko, meanwhile, received a yellow card for shoving in the latter stages and is clearly not someone who stands for much nonsense. \"The two Brazilian girls were quite aggressive, sometimes bordering on unsportsmanlike,\" she sniffed. \"This is swimming, not boxing.\" </p> <p>The law of the aquatic jungle clearly prevails - much as it does in every ruck and scrum in rugby union - and the Russian also dismissed suggestions that her trademark gambit - hiding in the leaders' slipstream for the entire race before leaving them for dead in the closing metres - was remotely underhand. \"It doesn't bother me in the least,\" she said. \"It's a competition and the best athlete wins. How can I stop and let someone else take my medal? I work as hard as anyone else. I don't think it's a relevant question.\"<br> As a parting shot, she even quoted the case study of an Australian man who tried to enter a women's open-water competition but didn't make the qualification time. \"Even if you're a superstar it doesn't mean anything when it comes to open water,\" cautioned Ilchenko. Phelps might be best advised to stick to the pool.</p>",
  "<p>On a dry salt lake deep in the remote west Australian outback, a British engineer is preparing for the ride of his life \u2013 powered by nothing but the wind. </p> <p>Richard Jenkins hopes the perfect gust will blow his high-tech buggy to 120mph and into the record books. If he succeeds, it will mark the end of a decade-long quest for the wind-powered landspeed record. It would also convince him that a greater goal is within reach: by swapping the wheels on his craft for ice skates, and windswept Australia for the frozen wilderness of North America, Jenkins wants to go faster still, and become the swiftest naturally propelled human on the planet.</p> <p>Jenkins is currently making final preparations for the landspeed record bid at Lake Lefroy, 300 miles from Perth. Heavy rain has delayed the effort, but a suitable window of dry and windy weather is expected to open within days.</p> <p>His craft borrows technology from Formula One racing cars and has more in common with an airplane than a sailing ship. While conventional land yachts have a flexible sail, this vehicle has a rigid vertical wing, which generates thrust in the same way as a conventional aircraft wing produces lift. Combined with its streamlined shape, this allows the craft to travel at up to six times the speed of the wind.</p> <p>Jenkins said: \"Top speed is actually quite scary. The structure and tyre grip is all at the limit, so keeping it in a straight line under full control takes full concentration.\" </p> <p>Trials in 2007 had to be aborted because of difficulty harnessing the immense power generated in even light winds. On a Nevada salt lake in 2005, Jenkins lost control at 106mph. \"The winds out there are much more unpredictable, and in search of the perfect gust, I sailed into a pretty violent wind and dust storm. I lost steerage and span for about a quarter mile. Stopped when I hit the scrub on the edge of the lake.\" To achieve the high speeds, the craft does not travel straight downwind but at an angle.</p> <p>The existing record of 116.7mph was set in 1999 by the American Bob Schumacher in his \"Iron Duck\" craft. Jenkins says he has already beaten that twice, in practice runs on the 3000m tarmac runway at RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire. His claimed speed of more than 120mph remains unofficial because there were no independent observers. In 2002, Jenkins officially clocked 113mph there, enough to set a new British record. The world record needs to be set on a natural surface, which rules out the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336776020\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2008/8/19/1219141923913/RichardJenkins.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Jenkins\" width=\"220\" height=\"321\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Jenkins</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said: \"I have tried every year, with different vehicles in different continents, but it is a tough challenge. The previous record holders spent five years on standby, waiting for the perfect day, and they live there, in the desert. If you have to travel overseas, assemble a team, the vehicle, official observers and a film crew, for ratification purposes as required by the Americans, and the perfect wind, it takes many attempts.\"</p> <p>This month's attempt will see Jenkins race the fifth version of his wind-driven vehicle, which was originally called Windjet, but has now been renamed <a href=\"http://www.greenbird.co.uk/\">Greenbird</a>, as a nod to Donald Campbell's Bluebird, under a sponsorship deal with UK renewable energy firm Ecotricity. A second seat has been fitted, to allow Dale Vince, Ecotricity's managing director, along for the ride.</p> <p>Vince said: \"Campbell made his record attempts in what historians will look back on as the golden age of fossil fuels. Fast forward 80 years and we are coming to the end of the age of fossil fuels and the dawn of the age of renewables. The Greenbird symbolises this historical watershed.\" Ecotricity says it will incorporate some of the craft's design into its wind turbines.</p> <p>The weather at Lake Lefroy is expected to allow record attempts until the middle of next month. On a good day, the team could make up to 40 runs, covering more than 200 miles.</p> <p>Because the craft is optimised for top speeds, it is relatively slow off the mark and can take 40 seconds to reach 50mph, more than twice as slow as a Robin Reliant. Acceleration beyond that point is more rapid, and it can reach 100mph in just another 10 seconds.</p> <p>From September, the team's attention will switch to running the craft on ice. Despite wild pre-war claims for speeds as high as 140mph, the generally agreed record for an ice yacht is 80mph.</p> <p>Jenkins says, in theory, ice should be a lot faster than land, and that 150mph is a reasonable target. \"But my experience on land tells me it is all much harder than you think. It is not out of the question that there may be a fundamental reason why it is impossible to travel fast on ice due to the skate-ice interaction at high loads and speeds.\"</p> <p>A speed of 150mph would be tantalisingly close to the ultimate speed record for an Earth-bound non-motorised human, which was set at 156mph by the Italian speed skier Simone Origone in 2006. Free from the surly bonds of Earth, the Austrian speed skydiver Alexander Diem reached an eyewatering 313mph during a jump in 2007.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>2.05am:</strong> Morning. Well, Team GB have had a fine Olympics thus far. To ease you into the early hours I'll let you relive the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/20/christineohuruogu.olympicsathletics\">success of Christine Ohuruogu, who arrived later than a Virgin train</a> on the West Coast Mainline to snatch gold in the 400m. </p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>There was also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/20/chrishoy.olympicscycling\">Chris Hoy's small matter of making Olympic history</a> by winning three gold medals in cycling; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/20/beijingcycling\">Victoria Pendleton's sprint to her second gold medal</a>.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>And <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/20/olympics2008.paulgoodison\">Paul Goodison's leisurely sail to gold medal success in the Laser class</a>.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>In the meantime I'll get you all the information you need to guide you through the morning.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2.10am:</strong> There are Brits in action already people. The inaugural women's 10k open-water swim is underway and Team GB's Cassie Patten and Keri-Anne Payne have medal aspirations. After the first 500m Payne is out at the front. But don't go expecting a medal yet as there's a lot of clear water left in this one. Payne obviously can't see where she's going, as she bounces off a bouy at the 13-minute mark.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2.20am:</strong> This is very much the New Olympic Sport Morning. BMX action has just bunny-hopped into life on a dusty track somewhere in China. It's pretty exciting stuff, if I'm being honest. The BMX-er (is that what they're called?) flies down a hill and then jumps over a dozen or so humps - bobbing up and down like a grasshopper - and finally flirts over the finish line. It's all over pretty quickly, but it's fun while it lasts. Britain's Liam Phillips and Shanaze will be competing at some point. I'll keep you updated.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2.25am:</strong> British pair Cassie Paten and Keri-Anne Payne are leading the 10k open-water race... but hold your horses Team GB fans, as third-placed Russian Larisa Ilchenko has never lost an open-water race, so how's that for having your chips dampened?</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>2.30am:</strong> Wow! The BMX-ing is the BEST thing ever. An Australian called Kamakazi has just hopped his way around the track. Apparently he changed his name by deed poll because he's such a <em>crazy</em> guy.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>2.35am:</strong> Liam Phillips was so quick for Britain 37.392sec that I missed him. But he wasn't fast enough to gain the lead in the time-trial. I'll update you as to his place when somebody in Beijing can work out what's going on amid the din of an American PA and French electro duo MGMT.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>2.40am:</strong> A pleasant email from an antipodean: \"Without wanting to get ahead of myself, let me be the first Aussie to congratulate you Brits on finishing ahead of us on the medal tally. It's been a super effort.\" Thanks William Sinclair. \"But I'm hugely proud of the Australian athletes who have, as usual, punched miles above their weight and, to a man and woman, conducted themselves brilliantly. The fact we'll finish behind our brothers and sisters in Britain for the first time in 20 years is unfortunate, but I can guarantee you that, like a losing Ashes team, we'll be using this to come back stronger than ever!\" I can almost hear the collective sacking of sports coaches in Melbourne William. Meanwhile in the land of men's beach volleyball the US are one set up against Georgia in the semi-final. It's like watching <a href=\"http://www.audioshocker.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/maverick07.jpg\">that homo-erotic scene from Top Gun</a>.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>2.45am:</strong> All the BMX competitors have kept their helmets on so it's my reckoning that they're all 44-year old former skate-punks. BMX-ing was huge around the time of ET you see. On the subject of the BMX-ing: \"Is it me or is the course not challenging enough?\" asks Michael Lee. \"Seventeen riders gone so far and no wipe-outs. It is only a 36 second-long course, and all riders are separated by just a 0.9 second gap. Maybe a couple of 30 metre-jumps should be included. Over crocodile-infested water. That would make things more exciting. Are there any other suggestions how we could liven this event up?\" You're a hard man to please Michael. What about scattering tacks and oil on the rack? Perhaps even a few banana skins. failing that give them fixed-wheel bikes.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>2.55am:</strong> GB's Cassie Patten and Keri-Anne Payne are still leading the 10k open-water race. They're taking on water as they go. They have to grab it out of nets and then somehow drink it. THEY'RE SWIMMING IN A RESERVOIR! All they have to do is duck and swallow and they'd save seconds on the water pick-up. Jeez! Liam Phillips has finished 25th out of 30-odd BMX riders. He'll have another round to increase his position and then he'll race-off against a competitor in a seeded competition. So basically, he needs to hop round that track a damn sight faster if he expects to get a reasonable draw.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>3am:</strong> The women have just set off in the first seeding run in the BMX race. The British competitor is called Shanaze Reade. She's the world champion in the event, and more impressively, she's from Crewe! Now I've got nothing against Crewe but it's not the first place I think of when I hear the words BMX. It's got an impressive <a href=\"http://cache.viewimages.com/xc/73433866.jpg?v=1&amp;c=ViewImages&amp;k=2&amp;d=17A4AD9FDB9CF1930F65A344AAC8D0702100197CECAB3D92284831B75F48EF45\">Grand Junction</a> though.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>3.05am:</strong> I have just cursed Shanaze Reade. The poor girl takes a terrible tumble at the first corner and appears to have gashed her elbow and left leg. She manages to get back on and limp to the finish line, but now, everything is riding on her second run if she's to get a decent seeding.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>3.10am:</strong> That was a great shame for Shanaze Reade. Although, it was good to see her looking angry rather than crestfallen when she finished. There were no Radcliffe-like tears despite the crushing disappointment of eating dust. A pedant writes: \"You would have thought that if Mr Kamakazi was going to go to all the trouble of changing his name that he would at least have spelled kamikaze correctly. Maybe it's like getting an Equity card; there can't be two people with the same name and there is another BMXer with that name already,\" says Pommie Barsteward, who I presume changed his name by deed poll. I've not got an issue with the spelling Pommie Barsteward, but surely if they were true Kamakazes they wouldn't exist after the first round.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>3.15am:</strong> Beleaguered Georgia just can't get assistance from the US. They've just been beaten in straight sets 2-0 in the men's beach volleyball semi-final. In the other semi-final Brazil are taking on Brazil. Yesterday we had a similar situation in the women's competition in which two Chinese teams competed against each other. This seems a bit odd to me. I'd have thought each country should only be able to enter one team each. Perhaps it's because there are not enough countries who are decent at beach volleyball out there.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>3.20am:</strong> The British pair of Cassie Patten and Keri-Anne Payne appear to be using tactics to prevent the imperious Russian Larisa Ilchenko from getting past them. It's not a bad idea because as it stands the Russian will have to swim sideways to get around them. There is the possibility of one of Ilchenko just getting rough and barging her way through though. Which could be her only option. The swimmers have all just taken on water again. It's a bit of a farce to be honest though, as they hardly get a gulp down them. It's due to finish in 35 minutes so stay tuned folks.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>3.25am:</strong> Liam Phillips has just made his second seeding run in the BMX but he couldn't improve on his first time so will probably have a tough draw in the quarter-final knockout stages.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>3.35am:</strong> The Brits are still in the gold and silver medal places in the 10k open-water swim. One of the coaches has been shown a yellow card for throwing a drink at his swimmer instead of holding it out on a pole. I wonder if that means he'll be banned from coaching in the next open-water swim? Which will be when? This is the first one of these that I've ever seen. In fact, (MBMer adopts Columbo-like pose) is the Russian only unbeaten because she's never raced before?</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>3.40am:</strong> John Lamberson from beach volleyball-central, Hermosa beach, California, brings us the answer to the reason Brazil are playing Brazil in the men's semi-final. \"Each country is allowed a maximum of two teams, as long as they are ranked in the top 24 in the world at the time of the games. There are a number of fairly boring reasons for this rule, which would put your already drowsy readers to sleep...\" Eh watch it John! \"But I would like to mention that there is a very large and impressive list of countries participating in international competitions, including a group of plucky Brits. About the only place it isn't played is the middle east and Indian subcontinent, which is understandable due to a general aversion to standard beach volleyball gear (bikinis and such).\" This is the home of rules readers. Oh yes.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>3.45am:</strong> There's a little under a 1km left in the open-water swim and the Brits are still leading. Former swimmer and Michael Phelps lookalike Stephen Parry reckons there's going to be fisticuffs in the final straight. I'd like to see how that takes place when they're underwater. But when there's gold up for grabs the Brits have been up for a scrap. Could this be gold No17 for Britain?</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>3.50am:</strong> This is the most exciting open-water race I have ever witnessed. I think you can guess why. The Brits are still gamely leading as they have done for 1hr51min so far. It's been one hell of a brave swim. None of the swimmers have been kicking their legs much in order to save their strength for the sprint finish, but expect them to start thrashing them like crazy anytime soon.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>3.55am:</strong> Ilchenko has started to make her move wide in order to try to pass the wall made by Payne and Patten. They need to up their pace here with just about 200m left. It looks like they've pulled away far enough from the chasing group to guarantee a medal apiece, but Ilchanko is coming alongside now.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>3.59am:</strong> Ilchenko is dead level with the Brits. She's showing rapid pace here.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>4am:</strong> With 50 metres left Payne is level with Ilchenko while Patten has dropped into third. This is an exciting finish.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>4.01am:</strong> Ilchenko shows why she is world champion by pulling away by a couple of metres to take gold. Keri-Anne Payne finishes with a silver and Cassie Patten wins bronze. That was a brilliant effort by the British women. They put a hell of a lot of effort into leading for so long, but were rewarded.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>4.04am:</strong> \"Gregg... I can't get to a TV. Can you tell if any of the open-water swimmers are doing the Trudgen?\" asks Tim Maitland. MBMer frantically searches for dictionary and finds a load of French gobbledegook that he can't understand. MBMer reads rest of email and sighs with relief. \"It was the answer to a clue in the Times crossword in today's South China Morning Post (\"developing swimming stroke\" if you must know).\" I didn't see much trudgening going on Tim, but I can tell you that Cassie Patten is mighty upset about the race. Apparently that pesky gold-medal winning Russian, Ilchenko was pulling on her feet to stop her from racing away.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>4.10am:</strong> Right, back to the BMX and Shanaze Reade is about to go off on her second run. Remember she fell in the first so a good run is imperative if she is to give herself a decent draw in the semi-finals.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>4.14am:</strong> There she goes... This time she flies around the first corner safely, hops over a dozen sandy hills and clocks a time of 36.8 to put herself second in the seedings. That was more like it. She's the world champion and showed why with that zippy run.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>4.20am:</strong> \"Just noticed that, according to the BBC live text commentary page medal table, GB have 16 golds, 0 silver and 0 bronze. Have we had them taken away from us for boasting?\" asks a perplexed Mike Barraclough. Very strange Mike. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics/2008/medals/full\">Our site is still showing those medals</a> to be in place but if British athletes suffer some bedroom burglary in the athlete's village (note to self - I might want to edit that at some stage, sounds wrong) we know which media organisation to investigate first.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>4.30am:</strong> I can tell you that in the big one, oh yes, the one you've been waiting for: Men's Water Polo Classification 7-12, Match 1 - Match 3, the Canadians have been beaten by the Italians 13-11. Unlucky Canada. It's a bad day for fans of Maple leaves.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>4.37am:</strong> I've just allowed myself a minute to watch the Taekwondo. It's pretty brutal stuff. I get the impression, above all else, the aim of the game is to kick the opponent in the head as hard as possible. The way they throw their legs about it's like watching <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=IqhlQfXUk7w\">that clip from Monty Python's Ministry of Silly Walks</a>, but just a tad more violent.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>4.40am:</strong> \"Is feet pulling ok then (all's fair in love and salt water?)\" asks Claire Garner, who earlier was stunned by my personal reply to her email request for the finish time of the open-water swim. We're a friendly MBM bunch here Claire. \"Or do we lodge an appeal or something?\" MBMer flicks through his open-water swimming rules book. MBMer finds rule ZX12: I believe the chance to appeal has been lost because Ilchenko wasn't sanctioned at the time. She could have been given a yellow card apparently, but wasn't. I think that's why anyway. Ah, the BMX men's quarter-finals have just started. Brill!</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>4.45am:</strong> The first quarter-final gets off to a crashing start. This is great. BMXs tumble into each other left, right and centre as they fly over the jumps and race around the bends. From the resulting carnage M. Day of USA wins in a time of 36.170. In the second, less dramatic BMX quarter-final GB's Liam Phillips finishes fifth. There's a second run coming up though, so results will be confirmed after that.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>4.50am:</strong> If you want to read all about GB's Keri-Anne Payne and Cassie Patten's silver and bronze medals in the open-water swim you can do so <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/20/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics\">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>5am:</strong> The interweb's been down for a few minutes here so just catching up on your emails. \"I'm wondering if the delay in the 10km medals is because Ilchenko may be getting disqualified for the leg-pulling incident,\" asked Pommie Barsteward. I've just seen the medal ceremony I'm afraid Mr Barsteward so that's a no-goer.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>5.10am:</strong> \"\"What on earth is BMX-ing doing in the Olympics?\" Harrumphs John Senior. \"What next? Subbuteo? The 200m Scalextric time trial? On second thoughts, if the world champion's a Brit, let's pad the BMX-ing out with lots more categories for 2012. BMX Team Pursuit, BMX Individual Pursuit, BMX Madison, BMX Keirin, and BMX...\" Whoah, hold on John, the BMX-ing has been great despite whether the Brits are any good at it or not. Perhaps it could be padded out to include all that X-Games business. Skateboarding and rollerskating can get involved too. Sod the Olympic purists!</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>5.12am:</strong> Meanwhile, the second run of the BMX quarter-finals have started and Mikey Day of the US still leads overall. Romero of Argentina takes a horrible fall and eats the tyre of the rider in front of him. Oooh! There's blood gushing from his torn elbow. He looks alright, despite the pain. GB's Liam Phillips finishes sixth this time round so I expect he'll struggle to qualify.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>5.15am:</strong> \"Open water swimming is brutal,\" whoops Jacob Murray-White. \"They beat the hell out of <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/news/beijing2008/open-door-in-games-closes-for-hackett/2008/05/04/1209839456445.html\">[Grant] Hackett</a> in the qualification and he ended up being disqualified.\" It looked a bit tasty out there when Patten and Payne were trying to keep ahead of the pack, but I can't imagine swimmers have the energy or inclination to take a swing at each other.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>5.23am:</strong> \"Paul in Sydney here...\" Hiya Paul. \"Good to see the Aussie Kamakazi lived up to his name, by being involved in a crash in his heat of the BMX. But I suppose 'Clean Run To The Finish' doesn't make for as snappy a name?\" I think you'll find Rochdale rider Clean Run To The Finish didn't qualify for Beijing Paul. He was getting a tattoo of a bear put on to his forehead apparently.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>5.30am:</strong> \"Just saw the replays from yesterday's weightlifting,\" says eagle-eyed Kyle Hauptman. \"Steiner from Germany won the heavyweight division (105kg) by lifting 258kg in the clean and jerk (that's over your head and holding it there for a moment) on his last lift.\" Crikey! \"I'll throw this out there: of all the things that Olympians do, this could be the furthest from the average person's ability. A lot of things at the games are amazing, like swimming 10k, but just look at the weight these guys put above their heads. The human body/spine is NOT SUPPOSED to do that.\" Good shout Kyle, but you've flummoxed me. The only other thing I can think of is some of the jaw-dropping flips the gymnasts pull off. If we were all doing that whenever we made a trip to the corner shop the world would be a chaotic place.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>5.35am:</strong> The third run of the men's BMX quarter-finals has just kicked off. GB's Liam Phillips needs a career-best run to qualify for the semis. The 20-year-old looks pensive at the start. With the number of crashes there have been so far it's little wonder why. And off they go...</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>5.38am:</strong> Oooooooh! Ooooowwwww! That had to hurt. About five riders - including Briton Liam Phillips - clatter into each other as they hit the first corner. Phillips gets to his feet and finishes seventh, which means he won't make the semi-finals. This has been a brutal spectacle. Kyal Bennett of the US has to have treatment on his left arm for five minutes before finally getting to his feet and milking the crowd's applause as he limps to the finish line.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>5.45am:</strong> The wonderfully named Bob De Wilde (pronounced Builder) and Kamikazi are in action in heat three, run three. Australian Kamakazi tries to restore some national pride with a ballsy run to finish third. To all the Australian readers out there, your man should make the semi-finals now. Whether you care or not is another matter, but this is all that's happening at the moment so you'll have to bear with me.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>5.50am:</strong> I can confirm that Australia's Kamikazi did indeed live to fight another day in the BMX. He qualifies with his compatriot Jared Graves for the semi-finals. I'm getting pretty delirious now so I'm going to pass the MBM baton onto Paolo Bandini, who looks much more alert than he probably feels. Thanks for all your emails. I hope we can get together again at the next big open-water swimming event. I can't wait!</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>6.05am</strong> Good morning folks. I've just been sticking <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/20/olympics2008.olympicscycling1\">this report on the Shanaz Reade's BMXing efforts</a> up all over the website, so why don't you distract yourselves having a gander at that while I get myself sorted?</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>6.15am</strong> Right then, the women's RS:X windsurfing is about to start, where Bryony Shaw is currently third in the standings, and can still win gold ... Actually, it already started once, but something went wrong so they're doing it all over again.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>6.19am</strong> Shaw's off to a good start, they're definitely saying that a lot on the telly, but frankly the pictures they're showing me aren't helping me to work out exactly how well. We basically haven't seen her since the start ...</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>6.23am</strong> A snipped of TV commentary insight: \"The wind has changed direction and that will favour Bryony Shaw ... But those pictures we're seeing now suggest I've actually got that wrong.\" I think my favourite thing about the Olympics is that in 64% of the sports involved, nobody <em>really</em> has a clue who's winning until the last 10 seconds.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>6.29am</strong> \"That Bmx sounds like good viewing,\" chirrups Scott Mellor, a man with a keen sense of hearing. \"Unfortunately I'm in China and the only coverage I have is of the baseball where the score is China 0-17 Cuba. As I'm not familiar with this sport, could you tell me - is this good or bad for China? Otherwise the other sport covered is trampolining which is something I stopped participating in when i was 14.\" Your loss on the trampolining Scott, and as for the baseball I'd say that's average to good going when playing against Cuba ...</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>6.33am</strong> OK, in the last five seconds, the Beeb's commentary team has stated that we could be on for silver ... or bronze ... or gold in the windsurfing if Shaw maintains her current positioning. Apparently it's all about where the Chinese sailor finishes.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>6.36am</strong> \"According to my Chinese colleagues, Team GB are second,\" pipes up Steve George apropos the windsurfing. \"Then again, two minutes ago they were asking me what the rules were ...\"</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>6.41am</strong> China are right back in that baseball game at 17-1.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>6.43am</strong> Ooh - could be trouble here in the windsurfing - Shaw was in the way of Spain's Alabau on a turn, and now the Spaniard's thrown a wobbly and called for the referee ...</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>6.44am</strong> ... But the umpire bounces over in his dinghy and raise a red flag against Alabau, meaning she has to do a penalty turn. Shaw looks a safe bet for a medal now, though it'll probably only be bronze.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>6.49am</strong> Yup, <strong>bronze it is for Bryony Shaw</strong>, and she looks happy with that. Rather more happy is China's Jian Yin, who finished behind Shaw in this race, but retains gold, leaving Italy's Alessandra Sensini to take silver.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>6.55am</strong> \"I'msohappyI'vehadsuchatoughweekandIlovemymumandshe'ssuchalegend andI'mjust so[badword]happy\", offers a painfully high-pitched Shaw in-between blubs of joy. Oh come now, it was only a <em>bronze</em> medal.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>7.05am</strong> \"While Team GB clearly deserves a great big pat on the back for doing so well in Beijing, I'm not sure if you understand quite what you're getting yourselves into,\" pipes up Scott Donaldson from Sydney. \"I'd say you're only a couple of gold away from having an absolute stormer by anyone's estimation. This runs the huge risk that you lot will go the way of the Australian sporting media: taking everything far too seriously and oscillating wildly between blind hero worship and vindictive tall poppy bashing ... with nothing (amusing or otherwise) in between.\" I'm going to assume Scott's never been in England when the football's been on before.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>7.13am</strong> Nothing too exciting for Team GB fans going on right now, so let's take a whizz round some of the other sports. France have beaten Russia 27-24 in the handball, Italy and Poland are tied at two sets all in the volleyball and a Canadian is running round the stadium wearing nothing more than a pair of bright red lycra hotpants at the softball. Have I just stumbled upon the real reason the IOC decided to cut the latter sport from the bill ahead of London 2012?</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>7.20am</strong> \"Bryony Shaw deserves more credit than you have given her,\" states Jack Springate, correctly. \"Most of our medals at this Olympics have come from the great British pastime of sitting on your arse (cycling, rowing, sailing). Surely a medal at an activity which requires standing up out of your seat warrants greater appreciation?\"</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>7.28am</strong> \"Hi, I've put together a simple page that ranks countries by their medals per capita and also by the GDP/medals for each country,\" offers Tom - speaking as if <a href=\"http://www.symworld.com/medals/\">this</a> was a perfectly ordinary thing to do. My life feels that little bit more complted now I know that Bahrain has the best ratio of gold medals to population of any country.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>7.37am</strong> The men's RS:X is under way at last, with Britain's Nick Dempsey chasing another medal for Britain, having started the race second in the table. I'm not going to lie to you, I missed the start because I was busy watching Italy beat Poland in the quarter-finals of the men's volleyball.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>7.40am</strong> Tom's table (7.28am) is about to get a lot more complicated. \"If GDP matters, then perhaps government funding for Olympic teams should matter as well,\" parps Kyle Hauptman. \"The USA is one of the few teams that get zero government funding - their funding is entirely private. Most people don't know this.\"</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>7.44am</strong> Things aren't going well for Dempsey. At last check he was seventh, and on course to finish fourth over all, though my experience of windsurfing would suggest that this may also mean that he is in any position from first to last and could still be on for either a gold medal or a pelting with rotten eggs. In the meantime, the French contestant has fallen off his board.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>7.52am</strong> <strong>New Zealand have taken gold in the men's RS:X</strong>, but it's still not looking good for Dempsey, who needs to pass the Frenchman in front of him to get bronze ...</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>7.54am</strong> Yeah, Dempsey's bottled it. Well, \"bottled it\" is probably a bit unfair - it was a very short race, just one lap, which made it nigh on impossible to recover from a less than sterling start - but hey, fourth place finishes won't improve that GDP/medals ratio any ... \"Tom's tables are impressive, but not really water cooler material,\" opines Gary Naylor. \"How about number of medals compared to number of media staff in Beijing on expenses (the BBC's Phelpsian numbers may hurt GB there), medals compared to drug convictions, medals compared to tears shed on podium etc?\"</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>8.02am</strong> In their interview after the 10km open water swim, Patten and Payne suggested that they could look forward to business class flights home because they had both won medals. Extrapolating this further, can we assume that Yngling gold medal winner Sarah Ayton will be travelling in the posh seats, while fiancee Dempsey folds himself into an economy seat? Equally, will Mark Cavendish be the lone British cyclist in the back of the plane?</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>8.06am</strong> More fun with medal tables, as Tobias Trotter points us in the direction of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/08/04/sports/olympics/20080804_MEDALCOUNT_MAP.html\">the New York Times' medal <em>map</em></a>, which roughly resembles a normal map, only with each country replaced by a giant smartie that grows or shrinks in size depending on the number of medals they won in whichever Olympic year you select. Plus it's supported by some of the most gloriously awful muzak you've heard in some time.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>8.14am</strong> OK, I'm actually quite a big fan of incomprehensible sports, but seriously now, what on earth is synchronised swimming about?</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>8.20am</strong> I've been pondering over these last six minutes, and I've decided that synchronised swimming would definitely be my choice of sport to cut from the Olympics if the IOC wanted to get rid of one more before London 2012. Should the opportunity arise, I would replace it with crazy golf. Just because. Any other suggestions for sports we could do with in four years time?</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>8.28am</strong> It's quarter-finals time in the men's basketball and Spain are 37-26 up at half-time against Croatia. Which is rather low scoring, when you think about it. Iceland are beating Poland 28-26 in the handball.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>8.34am</strong> At last, some clear-headed thinking from Andrew Jolly. \"I think we should replace the synchronised swimming with Morris Dancing,\" he poses. \"It's more or less the same, and let's face it, most countries other than GB are going to struggle to field a team.\"</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>8.43am</strong> Right, the combined effects of sleep deprivation and a whole morning without a British gold medal have turned my brain to goo, so I'm going to hand over to fresh-faced Robin Lynch. Thanks for all your emails.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>8.46am: Morning all.</strong> If you've just started work and are looking forward to a long day's skiving, I'll bring you up to speed on today's highlights.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>8.49am:</strong> We could see a third British boxer through to the semi-finals when <strong>middleweight James DeGale</strong> takes on Kazakhstan's Bakhtiyar Artayev at 1.01pm.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>8.57am: </strong>In <strong>Athletics</strong>, the gold medal hopes (fairly optimistic hopes, to be honest) for Britain are <strong>Christian Malcolm</strong> in the Men's 200m (3.20pm) and <strong>Tasha Danvers</strong> in the Women's 400m (3.35pm). But of course, the big draw tonight will be <strong>Usain Bolt.</strong> Can he break Michael Johnson's record in the 200m? Will he actually run the whole race or stop halfway for a breather? What will Sue Barker say to a crestfallen Michael Johnson afterwards?</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>8.58am:</strong> In the Men's Pole Vault qualifying rounds, <strong>Steve Lewis</strong> is Team GB's man. That's at 1.40pm.</p> <p>Wow, you guys really <strong>hate synchronised swimming</strong>. More on that in a minute.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>9.01am: </strong>Watch out for Britain's <strong>Emily Freeman</strong> in the Women's 200m semi-finals at 3.04pm, <strong>Michael Rimmer</strong> in the Men's 800m first round and Somalia-born <strong>Mohamed Farah</strong> in the Men's 5000m first round.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>9.03am:</strong> Finally, if you're Irish you can look forward (sort of) to <strong>Alistair Cragg</strong> in the men's 5000m first round and <strong>Darren John Sutherland</strong> in the middleweight quarter-final.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>9.08am:</strong> But the real battle for Ireland at these Games is the light-heavyweight semi-final between plucky upstart Kenny Egan and imperialist nemesis Tony Jeffries. That's on Friday.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>9.10am:</strong> In alternative sports news, Ryan Spencer wants to boot out synchronised swimming and bring in the multi-event-athlon. The MBM lawyer is peering over my shoulder but I can reveal that the multi-event-athlon consists mostly of petty crime and drug dealing. And he wants to base it in my neigbourhood! Harrumph!</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>9.10am:</strong> Leading the poll so far on new sports for Lahndahn 2012 are darts, snooker, morris dancing, <em>Eton Fives </em>and ....cheese rolling. Clearly you fine chaps have wandered on here by mistake while in search of the Daily Mail. But wait! Bruce Jackson raises a concern.<br> \"Synchronised swimming could be replaced by that chasing the cheese down a hill thing. Although there's always the suspicion that the French might be quite good at that,\" he says.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>9.18am: </strong><strong>More French-bashing. </strong> This time it's Tim Maitland. And he's not kidding.</p> <p>\"In defence of synchronised swimming it did provide one of the greatest sports stories of all time when it was pointed out to the French team prior to the Atlanta Games that their routine re-enacting the Holocaust (I kid you not) might be... err... a tad tasteless.\"</p> <p>But Morris Dancing is acceptable?</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>9.21am: Mandatory score update.</strong>Spain lead Croatia in basketball 72-59. Tum-te-tum.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>9.24am:</strong> Joe Milton is getting a bit sweaty thinking about all those hormones in the Olympic Village.</p> <p>\"I think Kiss Chase is due a welcome return! And from what I hear about the antics in the Olympic Village it could be an interesting one,\" he snickers. </p> <p>Also in contention: British Bulldog, Kick-the-can and Truth or Dare.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>9.28am: </strong>Inevitably, gloriously, triumphantly, <a href=\"http://pseudscorner.blogspot.com/2007/02/blogging-admitted-to-olympics-shock.html\">Gary Naylor</a> suggests <strong>Blogging</strong> for the 2012 roster. And I think we've got a nailed-down gold medal right there. </p> <p>Do you lose points for flaming? Disqualification for using too many smileys? Bonus scores for raising LOLs from your rivals?</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>9.32am: </strong>\"What about the 800m Freestyle Moaning-about-the-weather?\" wonders Ben Holloway. I'd back it all the way Ben, if only because Ireland would take a clean sweep on the podium. All. Day.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>9.36am: </strong>And if you've been punching your screen with rage at the thought if your beloved synchro swimming, here's a report what I wrote all by myself from this morning's action.</p> <p>Russia's reigning Olympic champions, the \"two Anastasias\", defended their synchronised swimming duet gold medal on Wednesday with an almost perfect routine swum to the strains of Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt suite.<br>Anastasia Davydova and Anastasia Ermakova, undefeated at a major championships since finishing second at the 2001 worlds, scored a perfect 10 for technical merit from all five judges and earned another three 10s for artistic impression.<br>Added to a commanding lead from Monday's technical routine, they easily claimed victory with 99.251 points, bagging a second gold medal for a collection started in Athens. </p> <p>So there you go.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>9.38am:</strong> \"<strong>Beach Volleyball</strong> is the second most played sport in the world,\" lies Hazel Irvine. 800 million players worldwide, apparently. Keep the synchronised swimming I say, get beach volleyball <em>out</em> of there. I can't take it seriously since they played Tom Jones' magnum opus, <strong>Sex Bomb</strong>, during one of the games on Monday. I mean, really.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>9.38am:</strong>If this anti-synchro swimming tirade continues, I shall have to inform Lord Coe. Michael Lee makes an <strong>anti-public school jibe</strong>, which I cannot repeat here, but involves Eton Fives and onanism. Ugh.</p> <p>On a much more wholesome note, Mike Hopkin (who I suspect is a atudent, unemployed or 97) suggests Olympic Countdown. \"Played with proper English spellings of course, so we'll always beat the Americans!\" he huzzahs.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>9.43am: </strong>Stuart Wilson also went to a comprehensive school.</p> <p>\"What about scrumping for apples, where public school boys line up to sneak tasty golden delicious out of the orchard? The last one to get dragged back to the dormitories by the janitor for a good towel whipping is the winner.\"</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>9.49am: </strong>Just to bring you up to date on the BMXing, in case you didn't stay up all night/don't live in Australia/haven't grasped how internet browsers work. <strong>Shanaze Reade</strong> who is going for gold (Gold! Always believe in your sooooul) will be top seed in tomorrow's semi-final, despite falling over on her first run.</p> <p>Not so hot for <strong>Liam Phillips</strong> though. His Olympics are over after being knocked out in today's quarter-finals.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>9.51am: </strong>My local neighbourhood, as well being blighted by petty crime and soft drugs abuse, is being terrorised by BMX gang warfare. The Switchblades currently have the upper hand over the Cobras, but to be honest I suspect most of them have played Eton Fives in the past. And probably morris dancing too.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>9.57am: </strong>Earlier this morn, Britain's first <strong>Taekwondo</strong> competitor <strong>Michael Harvey</strong> suffered a gallant defeat to world silver medallist Guillermo Perez. Sadly for Mike, Britain don't cheer on gallant defeats any more. But he does have a chance of making the repechage if Perez reaches the final.</p> <p>Harvey thought he had scored a winning point in overtime after fighting back from 2-0 down in the -58kg bout to tie 2-2. But the pesky judges scored for the Mexican.</p> <p>Harvey said: \"I caught his pad but obviously it wasn't hard enough or the judges missed it. I thought I had a good chance going into that last round but obviously it didn't go the right way. I did well because I was up against the world silver medallist but he was there to be beaten and I'm a bit gutted that I've lost. It's great experience for London 2012 but I wanted to go a bit further.\"</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>10.02am:</strong> Staunch republican John Senior has a pop at them lot in Buckingham Palace.</p> <p>\"Cut the synchronized swimming and revive It's a Knockout for 2012.<br>Even better, let's have It's a Royal Knockout, with monarchs from<br>around the world whacking each other with giant foam sticks while<br>balancing on slippery poles above a pool of green slime. First one in<br>the gunk gets the guillotine...\" he cries, pasting his stamps upside down and tearing up \u00a35 notes as he does so.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>10.06am: Drugs bust.</strong> There could be a shake-up in the heptathlon final positions after Ukrainian silver medallist Lyudmilla Blonska failed a drug test on the 'A' sample. If she fails the 'B' too, she'll lose her medal.

Whatever it takes.</p> <p>*last.</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>12.45pm: Athletics </strong>Almost done in the men's 800m heats.

I told you organised religion works. Tonia Couch is up to 12th with her second dive. Stacie Powell's up next.</p> <p><strong>Athletics</strong> Bringing you updates on the hammer asap. It's all going horribly wrong out there...</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>12.52pm: Diving </strong>Boom! Powell up to 22nd.

The Netherlands vs Argentina up next.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>1.07pm: Athletics</strong> China's Wenxiu Zhang has just thrown 74.40m in the hammer, which is quite good, I believe, and puts her into top spot.</p> <p>Just to let you now that each competitor gets five dives in the 10m individual platform.</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>1.10pm:</strong> Ireland's Darren John Sutherland is taking on Venezuela's Alfonso Blanco Parra in the middleweight quarter-finals. Ireland have only two medals so far, guaranteed bronzes for boxers Kenny Egan and Paddy Barnes, so a win here would be a welcome boost.</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>1.12pm: Diving </strong>Tonia Couch scores 76.50 on her third dive, a big improvement on her first two, 67.20 and 63.00. She's in seventh now. </p> <p>In the <strong>Boxing</strong> Darren John is getting the better of Parra, who is swinging wildly. It's 3-0 to Sutherland.</p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>1.16pm: Boxing </strong>Great defence and a body shot with the left gives Sutherland a further point. </p> <p>And he does it again! 5-1 now, after the Irishman dropped his guard for the first time in the fight and let Blanco in for a jab. It' s looking good for a third medal for Ireland here.</p> <!-- Block 140 --> <p><strong>1.19pm: Boxing </strong>Parra beat Sutherland in the world championships but he is getting a pummeling here. And it's mostly due to a much improved performance from the Irishman, rather than a sloppy display from Parra. 9-1 at the end of the third and Blanco really cannot handle him, mentally or physically.</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>1.21pm: Diving</strong> Now it's Powell's turn to zoom up the board. She lies in 15th after a third dive of 75.20. </p> <p>In the <strong>Boxing</strong>, it's medal number three for Ireland after a stunning performance from Darren John Sutherland. The Irish contingent are singing in the crowd and Jim Neilly is putting on corny Irish accents. Which is okay, cos he's Irish himself. But still a bit lame.</p> <!-- Block 142 --> <p><strong>1.26pm: </strong>Blanco is the world silver medallist, Jim tells me. It was 11-1 in the end to Sutherland. He <em>battered</em> him.</p> <p>Britain's James DeGale comes in now, he's got a big challenge against Kazakh fighter Bakhtiyar Artayev.</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>1.30pm: Boxing</strong> It's cagey so far. DeGale leads 1-0 after the first round, a reward for a sharp left hook into Artayev's body.</p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>1.32pm: </strong>More of the same from DeGale. He's moved in for a fast attack after a strong defence..and again! He concedes one that time as well, but he's getting on top. It's 4-1 to the Briton at the halfway mark. Artayev must find a plan B.</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>1.35pm </strong>They swap points early on, before another left jab from DeGale. He's standing back now on 6-3, and looking to take that lead into the final round.</p> <!-- Block 146 --> <p><strong>1.36pm: </strong>He's done better than that, he's bumped it up to 7-3 and we look set for another GB-Ireland semi-final. Sutherland and DeGale have fought each other five times so it should make for an interesting bout. Still two minutes to go though..</p> <!-- Block 147 --> <p><strong>1.39pm: </strong>8-3 and DeGale is jumping with delight. That was a tough opponent - the world bronze medallist - and he outfought and out-thought him all the way through. Didn't go for unnecessary points and worked the counter-attack brilliantly. <strong>Bronze for Britain</strong> (at least). That's three bronzes so far for Britain, and three for Ireland.</p> <!-- Block 148 --> <p><strong>1.43pm: Diving </strong>62.40 for Tonia Couch on the fourth dive; not spectacular but enough to lift her in seventh place. She just needs a competent final dive top reach the semi-final. </p> <p>Stacie Powell on the other hand is in 19th and outside the qualifying positions. She'll have to do better than that next time around.</p> <!-- Block 149 --> <p><strong>1.47pm: Athletics </strong>Mo Farah is out front for Tea GB in the <strong>Men's 5000m</strong> first round heats. He looks comfortable. Well, as comfortable as a man can be after several laps of pegging it round an Olympic stadium in stifling heat.</p> <!-- Block 150 --> <p><strong>1.50pm: Athletics</strong> Farah leads but the pack are on top of him. It's four to go through with one lap to go. This is the clutch play...</p> <!-- Block 151 --> <p><strong>1.52pm:</strong> Yargh! Mo is slipping back...he's going nowhere.</p> <!-- Block 152 --> <p><strong>1.52pm:</strong> They're sprinting away and Mo can only manage sixth. He'll have to wait and see if he makes one of the first loser slots.</p> <!-- Block 153 --> <p><strong>1.54pm:</strong> A bad run for Farah. He topped a group of six and the other five all left him for dust inside the last 100m. The second heat is coming up now; Mo put on a final sprint to make sixth in 13:50.95mins.</p> <!-- Block 154 --> <p><strong>2.02pm: </strong>In the <strong>Women's Hammer</strong>, Aksana Miankova of Belarus threw an Olympic record of 76.34m to take gold, with Cuba's Ypsini Moreno took silver with 75.20m and China's Wenxiu Zhang was third in 74.32m</p> <p>Minkova seems to have wandered in from the 5,000m; she is really quite slender. Especially for a hammer thrower. Dagger stares in the changing-room, I reckon.</p> <!-- Block 155 --> <p><strong>2.06pm: Factoid</strong> Three gold medals would lift Ireland to 18th on the medals table, as things stand. Three bronzes would mean....70th. In between Armenia and Taipei.</p> <!-- Block 156 --> <p><strong>2.08pm: Athletics </strong>Ireland's Alistair Cragg is in fact still in with a chance of making one of the <strong>Men's 5,000m</strong> fastest loser slots.</p> <!-- Block 157 --> <p><strong>2.11pm:</strong> Cragg ran 13:38.57mins with Spain's Aelemayehu Bezabeh ahead of him in 13:37.88mins. The final heat has just finished, and it's Australia's Craig Mottram in fourth with 13:44. That means Cragg will make the semi-finals with Juan Luis Barros of Mexico, who finished in 13:42.70mins.</p> <!-- Block 158 --> <p><strong>2.16pm: </strong>The <strong>Diving</strong> has finished and both Couch (12th) and Powell (14th) will make the semi-final. They face a stiff challenge to progress further than that though. China's Ruolin and Xin Wang Chen finished first and second with Canada's Emilie Heymans in third.</p> <!-- Block 159 --> <p><strong>2.23pm:</strong> Somewhere in Beijing there are men using poles to lift themselves over different poles. If anything amazing happens - such as one of the men <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/reutersComService_2_MOLT/idUKB18358820080818\">losing one of their poles</a> - rest assured you will be informed immediately . Well, not really. But definitely at some stage today.</p> <!-- Block 160 --> <p><strong>2.27pm: </strong>It's the <strong>Men's 110m Hurdles </strong>semi-finals coming up now in the Bird's Nest. This, of course, was the event which Chinese sporting icon Liu Xiang was expected to win, before he hobbled off in the first round with an ankle injury. </p> <p>And the Chinese are super annoyed. Because you can win all the judo, shooting and wrestling golds you want (and China currently have 45) but what you <em>really</em> want is a proper medal.

Behind him are David Payne of the USA, France's Ladji Doucoure and Jamica's Richard Phillips.</p> <!-- Block 164 --> <p><strong>2.40pm </strong>In the second heat, and in the absence of Liu Xiang, China's Dongpeng Shi is carrying the hopes of 1.3b Chinese. No pressure there, then.</p> <!-- Block 165 --> <p><strong>2.41pm:</strong> Shi dives desperately for the line..and falls over as he does so. Maybe no one noticed?</p> <!-- Block 166 --> <p><strong>2.42pm:</strong> Oh no! Fifth by two hundredths of a second for Dongpeng Shi. Let the gnashing of teeth commence. </p> <p>In first it's the USA's David Oliver then Poland's Artur Noga, Jackson Quinonez of Spain and another Jamaican, Maurice Wignall.</p> <!-- Block 167 --> <p><strong>2.45pm:</strong><strong> Jackson</strong> is an unusual name in Spain, I would imagine.</p> <!-- Block 168 --> <p><strong>2.49pm:</strong> As promised, it's <strong>Men's Pole Vault</strong> news. Britain's Steve Lewis has successfully navigated the early stages of his qualifying round. There are two groups of 19, and 5.75m is the mark to beat.

The USA's Wallace Spearmon was third, but has been disqualified for running out of his lane.
