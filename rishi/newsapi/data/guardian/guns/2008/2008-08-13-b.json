  "<p><strong>This article contains material provided by Seb Schmoller and we should have acknowledged his contribution. He has written on the same subject on <a href=\"http://fm.schmoller.net/2008/04/what-to-advise.html\">schmoller.net</a></strong><br> Being a virtual student used to mean skipping lectures after you'd signed up. Now, it's about attending lectures halfway across the world via the internet, replaying lecturers' best bits over a podcast and using online discussion groups to mull over questions. Being virtual can require much more work than anything that happens in a real lecture theatre.</p> <p>First, though, you need the right kit. This means persuading proud relatives, or the bank manager, that the following are essential if you are to leave university with a good enough degree to secure a five-figure salary: a lightweight, web enabled laptop with a good protective case that doesn't look like a laptop case; a small printer to attach to it, and a headset so that you can conduct free internet calls and therefore be in constant contact with home/your financial advisor. Oh, and it should have a good recent graphic card to that you can connect to Second Life - not for gaming of course but so that you can take part in virtual seminars as an avatar.</p> <p>If you've got them to agree to all these with ease, you can add: a PDA with a calendar to keep track of study timetables and deadlines, and a keyboard for text messages so that you can discuss the latest reading lists with your peers and take notes on field trips. It will also help you contact taxis late at night so that you aren't forced to accept a lift from whoever you've just met in the bar. And, of course, you will be using it to keep in contact with home when unable to phone or email.</p> <p>Parents/overdraft still got some financial slack? Then an MP3 player will allow you to listen to downloaded audio files of lectures and learning materials on the way to seminars. That way you need never waste a moment of potential study time. Naturally, you may also need to download the odd music track to help relieve pre-exam stress.</p> <p>If you are studying science or medicine you'll easily be able to make the case for an MP4 player to allow you to download revision videos while travelling and remind you of procedures on your first clinical placement.</p> <p>The next step, once you've collected all this hardware, is to find out what to do with it. Sign up in the library for every training session going, particularly those on how to conduct online searches. Typing a term into Google and hoping for something vaguely relevant is not going to get you to the kind of original research material that will impress your tutor. Nor is relying on Wikipedia. So find out from Google Help about such canny tricks as putting quotes around search items, learn how to search within a particular website, and use Google Scholar to search the scholarly literature. <a href=\"http://intute.ac.uk\">Intute</a>, a free listing of high quality web resources for education and research, is worth a look, and don't forget to make use of all the add-ins available if you use Firefox as your browser.</p> <p>Don't feel you need to rely on your own university's virtual learning environment for course materials either. Check out the <a href=\"http://www.oercommons.org\">open educational resources</a> website and you can have free access to lectures, lesson plans, homework assignments and videoed lectures from institutions all over the world. Virtually, you can be learning all about Game Theory from academics at MIT, while physically studying fashion at Leeds Met.</p> <p>If you find you've spent so long browsing that you've missed Freshers' Week but can't remember any more about it than those who overdid the first night cocktails, you'll need to start organising your time online. Create an account on a bookmarking service such as <a href=\"http://delicious.com/\">del.icio.us</a> or <a href=\"http://www.connotea.org/\">Connotea</a> so that you can bookmark stuff for future reference, sign up for RSS feeds, and install Google Reader so you'll be notified when new content is published on your chosen sites.</p> <p>And geeks don't have to be lonely. Collaborating through Facebook groups, wikis, Google groups, discussion forums and blogs are useful ways of practising online etiquette, although always beware plagiarism, which doesn't count as showing teamworking skills. Try seeing if you can get hold of the same plagiarism software as your university to check that you don't, completely by accident, submit someone else's essay instead of your own.</p> <p>Friendly as you find your online community, it is also worth remembering that you can also find things out from real people, real books, and sometimes even real lectures.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Saturday October 25 2008 to acknowledge Seb Schmoller's contribution.</p>",
  "<p>Being a student is an expensive business - \u00a311,000 a year on average, <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/UniversityAndHigherEducation/StudentFinance/FinanceForNewStudents/DG_10034860\">according to the government</a>. Fees and rent will use up a lot of it, but with some planning you can have some left over for a social life. So how do you draw up a budget that's realistic and workable?</p> <h2>1. Put pen to paper</h2> <p>Start with a sheet divided into two sections headed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/14/studentfinance.students\">Income and Expenses</a> and write down all of your sources of money and all the things you expect to have to shell out for. Don't forget costs like laundry or library charges, alongside rent, food and books. Being aware of how you spend your money can also show you where you could be saving, such as cutting down on coffees or making your own sandwiches. </p> <h2>2. Organise your income</h2> <p>While expenses will crop up on a daily, weekly or monthly basis, your income may come in a lump sum. If you get a maintenance loan, for example, it will arrive in chunks at the start of each term. If you have been working in the summer holidays before you start college, you will have a lump sum at the start of the year.</p> <p>It can be a good idea to put the money to cover your rent or hall fees into a separate account that you don't touch on a day-to-day basis. That way you know how much you have left to spend for the rest of the term. Divide up any money you have left so you know how much you have to spend each week. Whether income is in the form of a loan, parental contribution, bursary or wages know where it's coming from before it arrives. Work out how it breaks down week-by-week or term-by-term. </p> <h2>3. Maximise your income</h2> <p>Four out of 10 students - 750,000 undergraduates - have a job while they study. But you shouldn't work too hard, say the experts. Try to keep it to less than 15 hours a week in term time. Full-time work in the holidays can be <a href=\"http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/students/work_hols_while_student_8_1.htm\">tax-free</a> and good for your CV as well as your bank balance. If you don't yet have a part-time job but want to budget for one, expect to earn between \u00a370 and \u00a3100 a week.</p> <h2>4. Get help</h2> <p>Your university or college bank branch will most likely have a student adviser. Take advantage of them - the advice will be free and they can help you manage your money better. Ask about free <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/aug/14/student.accounts\">student banking</a>, overdraft interest rates and charges, and any student loans they offer. Your student welfare office will also have seen it all before, and might be able to help with access college hardship funds.</p> <h2>5. Get a discount</h2> <p>Look out for deals, such as special offer haircuts and take advantage of money off vouchers, bogofs \u2013 buy one get one free offers - and student deals in restaurants, bars or at the cinema. Use the <a href=\"http://www.nus.org.uk/en/NUS-Extra/\">NUS Extra</a> card to get money off at your favourite retailers. National and regional offers are listed on student-focused discount websites like <a href=\"http://www.studentbeans.com/\">studentbeans.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.snapfax.co.uk\">snapfax.co.uk</a>.</p> <h2>6. Learn to cook</h2> <p>Even the college canteen will charge a couple of pounds for something you can make yourself in a matter of minutes. Make your own sandwiches, refill your water or juice bottle, nick your granny's flask and make your own coffee for lectures. Use markets to buy cheap vegetables and fruit, buy own-brand labels in the big stores, buy a decent cookbook in the sale, or at a secondhand shop, and get staples like rice in bulk and you can eat well for \u00a325 a week. See our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/aug/14/student.cookery\">student recipes</a> if you need inspiration.</p> <h2>7. Turn unneeded things into cash</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk\">Amazon</a> is a great place to buy and sell used textbooks. Worth knowing when faced with a \u00a3150 reading list. Auction sites like <a href=\"http://www.ebay.co.uk\">eBay</a> are also good for getting rid of unwanted Christmas presents or misplaced purchases. If not online, use campus noticeboards and bookshops.</p> <h2>8. Manage your debt</h2> <p>You will be offered student overdrafts, student credit cards and student storecards but think carefully before you accept any of them. A low-interest overdraft can be a useful tool to help stretch the term's money, but watch the fees and the interest rate. A 0% credit card can also be useful for paying off big-ticket items or short-term borrowing, but don't keep money on it for longer than the 0% offer lasts \u2013 you will be hammered with interest. If you don't have a 0% card, remember to include the repayments in your monthly budget. </p> <h2>9. Keep tabs on your spending</h2> <p>Bank online, read your statements, look at receipts, save your coppers in a jar, compare prices in the supermarket and don't take out more than you need from the cash machine. It all helps you keep control of what you've got. </p> <h2>10. Avoid unnecessary expenses</h2> <p><a href=\"http://gosmokefree.nhs.uk/?WT.mc_id=ilevel_search_08\">Don't smoke</a>, obviously. It's bad for your health and is very expensive. A 10-a-day habit will cost you \u00a380 a month - \u00a31,000 a year. If you are living in private accommodation make sure you don't pay <a href=\"http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/index/life/tax/council_tax.htm \">council tax</a> and sort out your <a href=\"http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/noexcuse/index.jsp\">TV licence</a> with your housemates - you only need one for the household, not one each. And avoid laundrettes if you can - they chew through money: either share a load with a flatmate, rent a washing machine for the flat (from \u00a33 a week) or do what generations have done before you and take it home to mum.</p>",

Photograph: Vasily Fedosenko/Reuters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vasily Fedosenko/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Calamitous styling no-no of the year: we're shaking our heads in disbelief at how a Stella McCartney bra ended up being modelled in an ad campaign for - of all things - a mink coat. The designer is known for her pro-animal, anti-fur stance, so how did such a blunder happen? </p> <p>\"Stella went absolutely ballistic\", reported the Mail on Sunday, and threatened to sue the high-end Mayfair boutique. Now the ad, which ran in Vogue, has been dropped. Quite right too: the bra was lent for an editorial shoot, but mistakenly used for the advertisement. Whoops.</p> <p><strong>Asos bags Matt &amp; Nat</strong></p> <p>However, Stella can console herself with some shopping on Asos (admittedly an unlikely image). They've just started stocking one of our favourite designers - Canadian accessories line Matt &amp; Nat. <a href=\"http://www.asos.com/search/pgeSearch.aspx?q=matt+%26+nat\">The range</a> includes a gorgeous deep pink clutch and silvery-grey bag. They're both part of the brand's Japanese paper range - we strongly recommend you check out the <a href=\"http://www.mattandnat.co.uk/product/product_home/\">full Matt &amp; Nat range</a>, which is great for presents for both men and women. Why is it suitable for Stella? Sorry, we nearly forgot - they're all vegan. </p> <p><strong>All wrapped up</strong></p> <p>Dedicated eBayers and fashionistas will already have noted the arrival of the latest Celia Birtwell collection at Topshop. The previous collections have all been big hits, and with 60s-inspired floral dresses and blouses amongst the new numbers, this one looks set to be no exception. We particularly like the very wearable <a href=\"http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?beginIndex=0&amp;viewAllFlag=&amp;catalogId=19551&amp;storeId=12556&amp;categoryId=60502&amp;parent_category_rn=&amp;productId=782756&amp;langId=-1\">wrap dress</a> </p> <p><strong>Back to black</strong></p> <p>Meanwhile, next door at Topman, it's back to basics. The menswear store has been running a series of projects with designers reinventing the classics - now it's the turn of the black trousers. We're not sure quite how you redefine such a wardrobe staple without going too wacky, but with top designers like Ann-Sofie Back and Todd Lynn amongst those involved, it will be interesting to see what they do to reinvent the wheel. And \u00a365 for 100% wool plus a designer name is a good price, come to that.</p> <p><strong>School's in for summer</strong></p> <p>\"Clothes for girls who wish they'd been sluts in high school\" is how young designer Natascha Stolle describes her vision. Hmmm. Not sure we particularly like that as a creative principle, but it must be resonating somewhere, because Stolle has just been snapped up by London fashion week's top emerging talent show, Fashion East. Only a year on from her MA at Central Saint Martins, expect to see Stolle mixing teenage sensuality with more sophisticated chic on next month's catwalk. </p> <p><strong>And on a related note ...</strong></p> <p>Feeling bereft now that Gossip Girl's preppy, Marc Jacobs look has vanished from your \u2013 ahem - little sister's TV screen? Never fear - more guilty teen entertainment arrives this week with movie release Wild Child (Aug 15). Channelling a west coast fashion obsession fit to rival that of Park Avenue princess Blake Waldorf, 16-year old Poppy is shipped off from LA to English boarding school for bad behaviour. We know we're old enough to know better, but we can't resist a peek at the wardrobe of this high-maintenance miss.</p> <p><strong>Wardrobe hitch-ed</strong></p> <p>Fashion faux pas seem to be the theme of the week. The most shocking revelation from Peaches Geldof's surprise wedding in Las Vegas (only the elder Geldof daughter could possibly adopt Britney as a role model) is not the suddenness of the nuptials nor the fact that no one even knew she was dating the guy - including, according to <a href=\"http://fametastic.co.uk/archive/20080813/12693/peaches-geldofs-ex-boyfriend-confused-by-her-sudden-marriage/\">some sources</a>, her didn't-know-he-was-ex-boyfriend. No it was - prepare yourselves - the fact the groom kept his sunglasses on throughout. Presumably this was to indicate just how cool he is. </p> <p>The Rev Steven Fabretti, who joined the happy couple in holy matrimony, was less impressed. \"I remember thinking it strange to wear sunglasses inside the chapel. They held hands and looked eye-to-eye - with him still wearing sunglasses - during the ceremony.\" We can only hope they were <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/gallery/2008/may/29/fashion?picture=334461130\">Ray Ban Wayfarers</a>. \"They looked very happy together. I remember the bride looked very young and pale and quite angelic,\" concluded the rather sweetly innocent Rev Fabretti.</p>",
  "<p>David Edgar said of my opera Manifest Destiny that \"the writer Dic Edwards and the composer Keith Burstein presented a complex view of the motivations, ambitions and doubts of those attracted to suicide bombing\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/22/terrorism.uksecurity\">This muddled terror law limits free speech and wrecks innocent lives</a>, July 22).</p> <p>He went on to describe a legal action I brought against the London Evening Standard, which had carried a review claiming that I had made suicide bombers appear heroic. \"Unsurprisingly, Burstein took [the reviewer] to mean that he was glorifying terrorists, and thus - once the Terrorism Act 2006 came into force - at risk of prosecution should the opera be revived.\"</p> <p>The Guardian published a correction to this, though, stating: \"We referred to a composer as being accused of promoting terrorism. We should have made clear that this was the meaning the composer Keith Burstein ascribed to a review of his opera ... The court of appeal did not accept that the review conveyed this meaning and ruled that this conclusion could be reached only by a 'strained interpretation'.\"</p> <p>The correction needs a little clarification because I think it reads as though the court of appeal did not accept any defamatory meaning I had attributed to the words in the Standard. In fact, the court rejected one of the meanings (that I promoted suicide bombing) but accepted that the article was capable of bearing the other meaning - that I applaud suicide bombing and raise it to heroism. </p> <p>Crucially, the court went on to say that in the context of the review this second meaning was \"fair comment\", that therefore there was no libel case to be heard (and therefore no need for a jury), and that I should pay costs of \u00a370,000 (which bankrupted me). My case goes on to the European court of human rights.</p> <p>The court's statement that it is \"fair comment\" to say I applaud suicide bombing and raise it to heroism makes me feel vulnerable to being prosecuted under the Terrorism Act for Manifest Destiny - even though the opera highlights would-be suicide bombers renouncing violence and becoming advocates of peace.</p> <p>I believe that our freedoms are threatened by the existence of such oppressive measures as the 2006 act - in particular its clause on the glorification of terrorism. In effect the horizon of thought is lowered, posing a danger to all of us who wish to write radically or experimentally.</p> <p>Dic Edwards and I wrote our opera as a direct response to the new parameters of our world that opened up after 9/11. It seemed to me that the essence of our civilisation hung in the balance as, one by one, those values by which I thought we were defined - freedom of the individual, habeas corpus, the right to privacy, the right to jury trial - came under attack from our own governments.</p> <p>Little did I expect that the very mode of response, our opera Manifest Destiny, could provoke a reaction that would directly confront us with these new legal problems.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Keith Burstein is the composer of the opera Manifest Destiny </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:keith.burstein@gmail.com\">keith.burstein@gmail.com</a></p>",
  "<p>It is true that top-up fees have not dented the numbers starting university (Fees see rise in numbers of poorer students stall, August 12). After all, higher education is seen as the route to a decent lifetime income. However, for Bill Rammell to call the system \"fairer and more progressive\" is a travesty. Pay-later course fees within a market system will perpetuate and accentuate inequality within the university system and a skewed graduate labour market. Perhaps 20% of students, likely to be children of the better-off, favoured by the school system, will graduate from select universities targeted by employers, offering top salaries, golden hellos, generous annual increments and bonuses. Helped by parents in many cases, they will probably repay their debts in a few years; these repayments will be a small proportion of their lifetime earnings.</p> <p>The rest, many from less privileged backgrounds, having attended less prestigious universities, will start on significantly lower salaries, and can expect modest salary growth. They will be penalised for decades, paying effectively 40% tax on lower earnings. For a typical public sector worker such as a teacher, this will take about 15 years. For a graduate in the voluntary sector or a depressed region of the country, probably 25 years. It will hit hardest when, aged around 30, they cannot buy a house, afford family life, or save for retirement, while being heavily taxed to finance health and pensions for burgeoning numbers of senior citizens. </p> <p>This is regressive, unfair taxation, taking a higher proportion of lifetime earnings from lower-paid graduates. The amount that graduates contribute to financing higher education should depend not on their course fees but on how much they subsequently earn. Let us reconsider the alternative originally favoured, we are told, by the former chancellor, now prime minister: de-couple student tuition from personal debt, and introduce a progressive graduate tax instead.<br><strong>Lawrence Lockhart</strong><br>Bath</p> <p>Our report, Reality Check - Student Finance Regimes, confirmed the complexity of the current student support systems that operate in the UK. It also tracked the extent to which the current system incentivises full-time provision, creates inequity in institutional funding and contributes to non-completion because students who switch from full-time to part-time study face very different student support systems. Currently, 43.9% of students in higher education study part-time, the majority of whom receive no state support and cannot access fee loans. A holistic review of fees and their impact on the funding of higher education, as well as the impact on students, is a prerequisite for future sustainability and fairness.<br><strong>Pam Tatlow</strong><br>Chief executive, Million+ (university thinktank)</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Monday August 18 2008</strong></p> <p>The condensation of the report below of David Cameron's visit to the north-west made it appear that two aircraft carriers are being built in Carlisle. This work is being carried out in another town he visited, Barrow.</p> <p> </p> <p>It was dreary and wet, and slumped in a chair opposite David Cameron was a jobless hoodie: much of the north in a nutshell according to Policy Exchange, until yesterday the Tory leader's favourite thinktank.</p> <p>Not any more. Cameron took less than a minute after arriving in Carlisle - as far north as you can get on England's western side - to pan the group's dismissal of the region. It wasn't cities such as Sunderland, Bradford or the European Capital of Culture, Liverpool, which were hopeless, he said, after joining a confidence-building class for local teenagers. It was the thinking at Policy Exchange.</p> <p>\"This report is rubbish from start to finish,\" he said, repeating the charge four times in two minutes. \"I think the author himself said it might be a bit barmy. It is barmy.\" Referring to the report's co-author Tim Leunig, he added: \"I gather he's off to Australia. The sooner he gets on the ship the better.\"</p> <p>The timing of the study, Cities Unlimited, which calls for an end to government-subsidised regeneration in \"failed\" northern cities and for migration down south, was grim. Cameron had long planned a tour of the north-west, starting at Carlisle, which the Conservatives proudly flag as the most northerly city they control.</p> <p>Far from collapsing, locals pointed out, before filing into a David Cameron Direct public meeting, that the town was busy on the government's \u00a33.2bn order for two aircraft carriers, something they couldn't make in Oxford or Cambridge - the destinations favoured for northern migrants by Policy Exchange, along with London.</p> <p>\"It certainly won't become Conservative policy,\" Cameron said. \"Conservative policy is focused on the good work of continuing the resurgence of cities across the north of England.\" </p> <p>He also committed the party to retaining regional development agencies, one of the main dynamos of government funding for regeneration, in areas where they were working.</p> <p>Cameron's counter-offensive was helped by the incredulity, rather than resentment, which was the commonest reaction to the report's notions. Two of the first people he met at the Carlisle youth training centre, where he spent nearly two hours, added force to the argument as migrants who had moved in the opposite direction.</p> <p>\"I'm from Essex,\" said Hannah French, whose class on bullying offered the Tory leader a chair and share in the discussion. \"I love it up here. I wouldn't want to live anywhere else.\"</p> <p>She was seconded by Michael Joseph, a Londoner notching up 19 years in Liverpool where he markets Education and Youth Services, the private company running the teenage confidence sessions. He said: \"Close Liverpool down? It's a great city. I've brought up my children there. I consider myself an honorary scouser, and I won't have anyone rubbish the city. It's got a great cultural heritage, and it's given England quite a lot.\"</p> <p>Labour meanwhile seized on the report's \"curious\" use of data and alleged failure to compare like with like. Peter Kilfoyle, MP for Liverpool Walton and a frequent mouthpiece for the city, said Policy Exchange had completely overlooked the fact that Liverpool's containerised port was shipping more goods than in its supposed Victorian heyday.</p> <p>The solicitor general, Vera Baird, whose Redcar constituency is down the coast from \"failing\" Sunderland, said: \"Cameron can distance himself from this all he wants, but he needs to explain why his friends have no faith in the north. \"</p>",
  "<p>For many, it will be their first taste of living on their own, but it is important to remember that Freshers' Week is hardly a true reflection of what independent living is all about. Day-to-day life, even at university, rarely involves being assailed by free drink, condoms, tins of beans and invitations to attempt skydiving. Nor does it usually offer so many opportunities to ask for help and support or to meet new friends.</p> <p>So seize whatever is available without feeling obliged to use up all those condoms and beans in the first few days. Meet as many people as you can, but don't decide yet whether any will be a friend for life. And don't feel you have to follow up every offer of help, but file away the information in case you need it later.</p> <p>There are also a few things you can do before you arrive that will make your first week easier to handle. First, get your finances sorted and open a student bank account. Doing this in your home town and using the branch of the bank in your university town when you get there could save you spending the whole of your first day in a bank queue. Make sure you have applied for a tuition-fee loan, unless you have decided to pay the fees upfront, and that you know how you are going to pay for everything else. If you're taking a TV, remember you will need a licence, even if you are in halls of residence.</p> <p>Then, read through all the bumf sent by the university so that you know what's happening when, and which events are compulsory. Buy a diary and mark in things you really want to go to. Musts are registration, meeting your tutor, the library tour, and Freshers' Fair. Put all this somewhere near the top of your packing, together with copies of your exam certificates, fee payment forms or evidence of who is paying the fees, your NHS number, forms of ID, a collection of usable passport photos, any other documents you need for registration. </p> <p>Check Facebook for any fresher or subject-based groups at the university you might want to join. Choose a travelling outfit in which you feel confident but which doesn't make you look scarily unapproachable. Resist taking too many cuddly toys. Work on introducing yourself to everyone you meet. Prop open the door as you unpack. </p> <p>Try not to fall in love with your next-door neighbour, get stuck with the same small group, pass out, or get arrested. Any of these could mean missing out on the full range of activities available.</p> <p>On the other hand, don't join every wacky society that waves a clipboard in front of you. You're unlikely to find time for breakdancing or hot-air ballooning if you're also serious about student politics. And you're perfectly entitled to spend an hour or two alone in your room reading a book.</p> <p>Don't be too disappointed if, by the end of the week, you haven't had a single conversation about Wittgenstein or the origin of the universe. In fact, count yourself lucky if you get beyond A-level results, campus geography and how ill someone was on their gap year. Deep conversations usually happen after you've got to know someone a bit, so even if you really don't care how many toilets your neighbour visited between Delhi and Mumbai, feign interest and, ideally, come up with a few holiday horror stories of your own.</p> <p>If after a week you've spent your entire loan for the term, eaten nothing but the lime that came with the tequila slammers, and are still to sleep in your own bed, don't feel you have to keep up this pace for three years. And if you've found the whole experience boring, noisy and miserable, don't give up and go home. Real university life hasn't started yet.</p>",

  "<p>Results day. Time to adopt a smug smile and plan what posters you'll put up in your student room. Or, time to wish you'd listened to advice about researching alternative courses and clearing hotline phone numbers, and to avoid anyone who's smiling. The worst thing about clearing is being forced to convince admissions officers how brilliant you are, just when you want to curl up and wallow in failure. </p> <p>The only way to cope is to become businesslike about the whole process. Think of yourself as a product, albeit one that needs to meet the client's specifications, has to do its own marketing and, usually, pay. Comfort yourself with the fact that, although the original sale has fallen through, there are still plenty of people out there who would be only too pleased to snap you up. Indeed, more than 38,000 students received places through clearing last year. You just need to make sure the best clients don't snap up a rival product first.</p> <p>So, you'll have to be quick off the mark. You may decide the best option would be to wait a year and travel or do retakes, but check that you can afford it. If you're sure you want to start uni this year come what may, the first thing to do is log into the Ucas track website to check that your original institution hasn't offered you a place anyway. If it hasn't, or no decision is recorded, call the university's clearing hotline and speak to the course tutors. If they haven't yet made a decision, ask when they will, and be prepared to dazzle them with your personality and enthusiasm, and even travel to see them. </p> <p>If you are offered a place on an alternative course at the same university, it is worth considering. You already know that you like the place, just make sure the subject really does interest you. If not, double-check on the Ucas website that you meet the criteria for clearing.</p> <p>Next, you need to search the website for interesting course vacancies. Check what the courses involve, the entry requirements, and make sure you want to go there before you start phoning individual institutions. Have your Ucas reference to hand and details of your results, including GCSEs. Know your postcode.</p> <p>Act fast and be flexible but take time to do your research, and ask for advice. Don't necessarily go for the first offer or you may find yourself studying ballroom dancing with chemistry when you really wanted to do medicine.</p> <p>Sell yourself hard and be prepared to explain why you want to study that particular subject at that particular university. But always ask for a day or two to think about any decision, and don't be afraid to find out what kind of financial help might be available and what accommodation is likely to cost. </p> <p>All this can take a while but don't drown your sorrows while you're waiting. Admissions officers won't be impressed, even if you say you really love them. Nor should you ask your mum, or anyone else, to call on your behalf. It won't get you anywhere and it makes you look wet.</p> <p>Once you've found a university that likes you, and you like them, you'll need to send them your clearing passport, which should arrive from Ucas early in the week following the results. Read the instructions on it carefully and don't send it off until you have a firm offer that you're sure you want to take up. </p> <p>Painful as all this seems, remember that no one will ever care whether or not you got your place through clearing. From now on, it's what you get up to as a student that counts.</p>",
  "<p><strong>When I'm feeling ill, I tell my mum and she looks after me or calls the doctor. Who should I tell at university if I'm not well? </strong></p> <p>There may be specific GP practices where you can register, or even a practice on the campus. If you are ill, make an appointment with the GP or ring your practice to ask for advice. If you feel ill and your practice is closed, then there will be an emergency GP service, or alternatively ring NHS Direct for advice on 0845 4647. </p> <p>When you are unwell, make sure someone locally knows, so they can look in on you and make sure you're not getting a lot worse.</p> <p><strong>My boyfriend and I have been going out since year 11, but we've decided to break up when we go to uni. Should I have a sexual health check-up?</strong></p> <p>It is a good time to do this, and essential if you have any symptoms. If you have any concerns, have a sexual-health screen. Some student-based practices have developed their own services. Always use condoms with new or casual partners and continue with this until you are sure you and your established partner have no STIs.</p> <p><strong>Is drinking too much really that big a deal? University is only for three years. </strong></p> <p>Getting drunk now and then is not harmful, but there are degrees of danger. In the short term, the risks are not from the physical effects of alcohol but from related accidents.</p> <p>Emergency departments are full of people who have hurt themselves or been hurt by others when drunk. Unfortunately, I have seen countless students (male and female) who describe truly horrible circumstances of assault (physical and sexual) that have occurred only because they were so drunk. Drink (if you wish), be happy and enjoy, but make sure you stay safe.</p> <p><strong>I honestly think I might be exam-phobic. I find the whole experience of doing an exam absolutely crippling. Am I stupid to be even going to university? </strong></p> <p>Most students feel stressed at some time about something. Exam fears are normal. It's true that some feel it more than others, and some even get to the point of feeling ill, but this mustn't stop you going to university. If you really struggle with exams, there are tactics you can use to build up to them. The university will have a student support section that will help students who feel like this. In extreme cases, anxiety can have physical symptoms (feeling your heart race, difficulty sleeping etc). Consult your GP if this is the case.</p> <p><strong>It is so hard to get on a doctor's list at home. I don't want to register with a GP at university; do I have to?</strong> </p> <p>There can be a number of reasons why students don't want to move practice. However, the NHS asks that you are registered with a GP near your term address. Statistically, you are much more likely to get ill in term time than when on holiday. Your notes and past history are really helpful to a GP, and it can take six to eight weeks for notes to transfer, so register with a GP as soon as possible. Obviously, if you have longer-term conditions it is even more important. </p> <p><strong>I'm really scared of going to university, as I find it very hard to make new friends. Will I fit in? </strong></p> <p>Most people feel out of place when starting university - it can feel a very big step. Just about everybody agrees that this is one of the best bits about university life, developing your own independence and your own identity in a way you've not been able to before. </p> <p>Not everyone has the confidence to start speaking to people they've not met before, but give yourself the best chance by participating in clubs that interest you.</p> <p><strong>I never do serious drugs, but me and my mates share the occasional spliff and I've done a few pills. I'd never touch any hard drugs. That's OK, isn't it?</strong></p> <p>Because you've got away with it so far does not mean it is without risk. There is increasing evidence of a long-term effect on mental health for people who use cannabis. And with \"pills\" you don't know what you're getting. These are illegal substances and therefore they are beyond any controls. You don't get a list of what's in it or a use-by date. </p> <p>Both these types of drugs can form into a habit easily. They have physical dependence properties, but the main difficulty is with social habit - \"this is what I do when I go out\". The social habit can lead to problems in your life. University is a clean break from home so now may be a good time to choose not to use these substances.</p> <p><strong>I've had depression since I was 14 and the doctor put me on tablets last year. I'm worried how this will affect my time at university. </strong></p> <p>If your doctor thought you should be on these tablets, then you should remain on them for now. Make an appointment to see your new doctor at university. It may be worth booking a longer appointment so you go through the past history. Don't just stop them on your own. Take advice and ensure someone is continuing to see that your mood is ok. Usually anti-depressants help with low mood, which can cause loss of concentration, poor memory and lack of sleep. So, being on the tablets may make you work and function better than if you came off them. </p> <p><strong>I think I may have an eating disorder. I'm worried people will notice at university.</strong> </p> <p>Many eating disorders are linked with a common theme of control. Some of the students I see have had issues for years, but eventually resolve the problems themselves. However, there is help available no matter how serious the problem is or how long it's been going on. Speak to your GP, or a counsellor, or explore local services for eating disorders - NHS Direct can help with this.</p> <p><strong>Everyone else seems to have done everything. They smoke and drink and have had loads of girls. I am so straight; I really don't think I'll fit in. What if a girl realised I'm a virgin? </strong></p> <p>You are not a lesser person than someone else because your experiences have been different. Just be you. You've no need to lie, but equally no need to share or broadcast your experiences or lack of them. </p> <p>No girl or boy can tell what you have or haven't done and they are not likely to ask you (many of them will feel like you do and worry what you might say in return). Your best defence in any potential relationship is to pick someone you really get on with on lots of different levels. As for your mates, say nothing - most guys will tease each other about different things, and sex is a common target. But ride it out - there'll be others hearing the same jokes and jibes, hoping no one asks them.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Dr Adam Connor is a GP at the University of Nottingham health service</p>",
  "<p>Hollywood has been startled by news that Tom Cruise has dropped out of the forthcoming spy thriller Edwin A Salt to be replaced in the lead by - Angelina Jolie. Of course, Jolie has such a badass image that she can get away with playing an action lead that would traditionally be assigned to a man. And sex-role-reversal is not exactly new. Dame Judi Dench took over Bernard Lee's role as \"M\" in the 007 movies. Mamma Mia: The Movie achieved a similar feat; the Abba song Does You Mother Know? was originally addressed to a younger woman by an older man - a faintly creepy effect that the film cancels out by having an older woman sing it ironically to a pert young stud.</p> <p>But what would have happened if casting directors had taken this experimental attitude in the past? We could have had Terminatrix, with Melanie Griffith clanking around as the chilling cyborg-assassin, exploiting that star's somewhat vacant stare to sinister effect, as she smashes up a police station and informs one and all with her trademarked breathy delivery that she will \"be back\". Or perhaps a version of Casablanca set in Ricarda's place, with Lauren Bacall as the world-weary bar-owner. Or Bette Midler as Mr Doubtfire, the adorable male nanny. Or perhaps a new, more harshly titled version of Reservoir Dogs with Sandra Bernhard and Joan Rivers as Ms Blonde and Ms White tying up a cop and brutally attaching an earring to his unpierced ear.</p> <p>These fantasies are beside the point. Jolie should simply go about remaking every single Tom Cruise film with herself in the role. She could be the Hitler assassin Stauffenberg, and she would wear the eye-patch loads better than Tom. She could be the sports agent in Jerry Maguire and her delivery of the line: \"The fucking zoo is closed!\" would be hair-raising. She could be Madame Phelps in Mission Impossible, lowering herself from the ceiling on pulleys and tapping away on laptops, flexing abs and biceps far more buff than Tom's. Most importantly, she would be a great navy pilot in Top Gun, and her lethal presence as she \"rides someone's tail\" would give us a break from all that tiring 80s suppressed homoeroticism. </p> <p>Apart from everything else, she would be a lot taller.</p>",
  "<p>The Israeli military will not take action against a tank crew that killed a Reuters television cameraman and eight other Palestinian civilians in Gaza and has defended the decision to shoot as \"sound\".</p> <p>In a letter to the Reuters news agency, Israel's top military lawyer, Brigadier General Avihai Mendelblit, said the troops involved in the shooting in April could not tell whether cameraman Fadel Shana, 24, was holding a camera or a weapon but nonetheless reached a \"reasonable conclusion\" that he was \"hostile\".</p> <p>One of the reasons for the tank crew's suspicion, said Mendelblit, was that Shana and his soundman were wearing blue flak jackets, which the Israeli military lawyer said were \"common to Palestinian terrorists\". The jackets were marked with the word \"PRESS\" and were identical to those worn by journalists reporting on conflicts across the world. Shana's car also carried large \"PRESS\" and \"TV\" markings.</p> <p>Shana was killed on a day of heavy fighting in Gaza that left 18 Palestinians, nearly all civilians, and three Israeli soldiers dead. Shana arrived shortly after a series of Israeli air strikes in a Gazan village and began filming. The last few seconds of his footage show an Israeli tank on a distant hilltop. There is a flash and a cloud of smoke as the tank fires a shell and moments later a second bright flash close to the camera as dark shapes come shooting out. The tape then goes black. </p> <p>His body was hit by several inch-long metal flechette darts from the tank shell.</p> <p>David Schlesinger, editor-in-chief of Reuters, said yesterday he was disturbed by the decision. \"I'm extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analysed clearly,\" he said. \"They would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response.\"</p> <p>The decision came in a letter sent on Tuesday by Mendelblit, Israel's military advocate general. \"The tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti-tank missile, a mortar or a television camera,\" he wrote.</p> <p>He said the crew were suspicious partly because of the blue flak jackets, and because of an attack that killed three Israeli troops earlier in the day elsewhere in Gaza and because of a separate grenade attack on a tank. \"In light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon, the decision to fire at the targets ... was sound,\" he wrote. </p> <p>\"Fadel Shana's death is a tragedy ... A journalist in action was killed by IDF [Israel Defence Force] fire, along with others not involved in the hostilities. However ... the available evidence does not suggest misconduct or criminal misbehaviour ... I have therefore decided ... that no further legal measures will be taken.\"</p> <p>Reuters sent a letter back yesterday asking why the soldiers ruled out the possibility that Shana was indeed a cameraman and why the tank crew did not simply reverse out of sight.</p> <p>The Foreign Press Association in Tel Aviv said it was dismayed. \"The IDF's decision to close its probe without taking any disciplinary action is the latest in a long line of cases clearing its soldiers of deadly negligence,\" it said. \"The FPA believes the army is obligated to clearly identify its targets before firing, especially in areas where civilians and journalists are present.\"</p>",
  "<p>An appalling forecast for the remaining two days of a match that has already lost one to rain suggests that Yorkshire will struggle to claim the Roses victory they need to overtake Lancashire in the battle for First Division survival. But in the 64 overs that were possible yesterday, Matthew Hoggard and Adil Rashid combined to deepen the mood of pessimism and uncertainty hanging over this ground.</p> <p>They took three wickets each after Lancashire won the toss and took first use of a decent pitch, and although that was a tribute to some class bowling and to Darren Gough's positive captaincy, there was also plenty more evidence of problems on and off the field at Old Trafford.</p> <p>A top five that looks alarmingly fragile duly failed again, while the captain Stuart Law poured fuel on the controversy caused by Tuesday's announcement of Dominic Cork's imminent departure by expressing surprise at not being consulted. \"You'd think the captain should be involved in something like that, wouldn't you?\" said the Queenslander, whose own future remains uncertain. He took on the captaincy last autumn on a one-year deal.</p> <p>Iain Sutcliffe was promoted to open despite a couple of unsuccessful games at No3. He lasted less than three overs, playing all around a classic Hoggard outswinger. Law promoted himself and made a fist of it in a second-wicket stand of 54 with Paul Horton. But Gough's boldness in introducing Rashid from the 14th over paid off as, after having Law dropped at slip in his second over, he trapped Horton with a top-spinner in his fifth.</p> <p>Law then steered Tim Bresnan's loosener to second slip, and Lou Vincent's struggle to justify his employment as the overseas player continued as he was caught behind in Bresnan's next over. A promising innings by Francois du Plessis was ended by Rashid, driving to one of two short covers placed there by Gough, and Hoggard then returned to have Luke Sutton caught low down by Gerard Brophy, and to bowl Glen Chapple.</p> <p>Cork's first chance to prove a point ended with a heave at Rashid and another good catch, this time by Rana Naved running back from mid-off. Only Steven Croft, with an unbeaten half century, saved Lancashire from further embarrassment.</p>",
  "<p><strong>\u00b7</strong> First volunteers were told to avoid the foreign media. Now police are taking a hands-on approach. British reporter John Ray of ITV News was briefly detained as he covered a protest by Students for a Free Tibet at Beijing's Ethnic Minorities Park, close to the main Olympic zone, and the Guardian's Dan Chung was among those manhandled as he photographed officers removing activists. Ray said police roughed him up and wrongly accused him of carrying a Tibetan flag. He was forced into a police van and driven away despite showing accreditation. An official from Beijing's public security bureau said later that police had mistaken him for a protester. Seven American demonstrators were deported last night; it is thought Pema Yoko, an ethnically Tibetan woman with Japanese citizenship but brought up in the UK, was also being removed.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A dancer injured in a rehearsal for the opening ceremony could face a life of paralysis, Chinese media have reported. The Shanghai Morning Post said Liu Lan, 26, underwent six hours of surgery after falling from a stage at the Bird's Nest stadium last month. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Tens of thousands of internet users have joined the hunt for the father of one of China's new sporting heroes. Guo Wenjun, right, almost quit shooting after her father abandoned her to the care of her coach a decade ago, but trainer Huang Yanhua convinced her that winning gold - as she did in the women's 10 metre air pistol this week - \"could be the most effective of any missing persons notice\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A legal activist who applied to demonstrate in designated \"protest zones\" established for the games has been detained, Human Rights Watch said yesterday. The group said Ji Sizun, 58, from Fujian province, was arrested on Monday as he visited a police station to check on the status of his application. Witnesses saw several men escort him to an unmarked car and he has not been seen since.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> On Sunday, Russian and Georgian athletes embraced despite the conflict between their countries. But tempers frayed in the unlikely setting of the Olympic beach volleyball court. \"We were not playing against the Georgian team today,\" sniffed defeated Russia's Natalia Uryadova. \"We were playing against the Brazilian team. If they are Georgian they would certainly have been influenced [by world events], but certainly they are not.\" Her teammate's claim that they could not even name the Georgian president was disproved by Christine Santanna's swift reply: \"It's Mikheil Saakashvili, and I was with his wife here two days ago in the village.\" Mrs Saakashvili, apparently a keen beach volleyball player, invited Santanna and her teammate Andrezza Chagas to form the Georgian squad.</p>",
  "<p>Earlier this week there were a couple of tanks parked outside the press centre in Beijing. Were a single blade of grass allowed to flourish on this forecourt, you could say the Chinese authorities had literally parked their tanks on our lawn. Good of them to provide their own metaphors: Beijing 2008 really is a micromanaged operation. </p> <p>Of course, that was not the official explanation. As the Beijing organising committee (Bocog) revealed at one of its daily press conferences, the tanks had been deployed to reassure journalists. Because nothing reassures Western journalists like the sight of Chinese tanks. </p> <p>And so to the daily Bocog briefing, whose motto might as well be: move along, nothing to see here. Nothing except the greatest sports show the world has ever known, that is. It is an event which manages to convey both the hosts' mania for controlling everything and the impossibility of doing so. It is held with ill-disguised reluctance to appease people who are used to having their questions answered and is conducted on behalf of people unused to such quaint customs. It is becoming vaguely attritional. </p> <p>Each day Bocog's media chief, Wang Wei, and its spokesman, Sun Weide, take to the podium, along with the International Olympic Committee's spokeswoman and a couple of special guests. Yesterday's special guests were the Games' director of security, who looked as if he would rather be stapling his eyelids to the floor than sitting there, and the IOC executive director, Gilbert Felli, who appears to have drunk deep from the Chinese Kool-Aid. Felli does only two adjectives: \"happy\" and \"fantastic\". They even find their way into his wildly credible anecdotes, one of which detailed Jacques Rogge's decision to take breakfast in the athletes' village, desperately hoping no one would recognise him and feel he was bothering them. \"But more than 15 athletes came to see him,\" gibbered Felli, \"and said 'President thank you, it's fantastic, we have never seen a village like this, we have never seen conditions like this...'\" </p> <p>\"Is there anything you're not happy with?\" a German reporter wondered sarcastically. \"I would not use the words 'not pleased',\" mused Felli. \"Maybe 'not praising as much'...\" </p> <p>Of most palpable irritation to the hosts, though, is the media's insistence on discussing China's Milli Vanilli moment. To recap, that is the discovery that Lin Miaoke - the nine-year-old who sang the Grammy-bait opening ceremony anthem \"Ode to the Motherland\" - was in fact lip-synching to a recording of the voice of another girl. Shortly before the ceremony, Yang Peiyi, seven, was told she had lost the gig, having failed to meet the organisers' exacting cosmetic dentistry standards. Bocog apparently thought the issue had been sufficiently dealt with after ceremony organisers explained the decision had been taken \"for the benefit of the country\". \"The child on camera should be flawless in image, internal feelings and expression,\" they said, \"and Lin Miaoke meets our requirements in those aspects.\" She was duly declared \"an instant star\". </p> <p>Maddeningly, though, questions about this routine child-sacking persist and yesterday Felli was asked whether he deemed it \"in line with the aspirational goals of the Olympic movement\". Had he been the father of the rejected girl, how would he have explained it to her? From what followed, it appeared that Papa Felli would have deployed a failsafe technique, asking that she imagine her position as analogous to an Olympic rower who knows there are only four places in the boat, or a footballer who knows he is playing for his place. Smiling for it, in this case. </p> <p>Still, do not grieve too much for little Yang - who was only a snaggletooth away from instant stardom, followed by a lifetime of increasingly bitter realisation that her showbusiness career had peaked at the age of seven. Just accept that the mantle of child star clichedom passed instead to Lin, who we must assume is already becoming quite the little Chinese Drew Barrymore. In fact, because there is literally nothing which the Chinese authorities would not command you to see in a positive light, do expect to hear Lin's eventual slide into \"suffering from exhaustion\" glossed by Bocog as indicative of important gains in China's burgeoning rehab sector - currently still a peasant economy but soon to enslave us all. </p> <p>In this faintly frustrating atmosphere, though, the \"final question freakout\" is becoming a setpiece of Bocog's daily meeting. On Tuesday it was a radio journalist exploding at mysterious delays to her Tibetan colleague's accreditation; yesterday it was a reporter exploding at the continued failure to reveal how many applications for protests had been made and how many had been rejected. It was first asked five days ago. \"We have repeatedly asked this question,\" she said, her voice rising. \"When can we get this answer?\" </p> <p>\"We will check with the governing authorities and, if there is any news, we will get back to you,\" said Sun Weide, with the air of man who would get around to it just the minute he had built a scale matchstick model of the Great Wall of China.</p>",
  "<p>New Zealand's under-pressure coach, Graham Henry, says he is not concerned that the controversial official Wayne Barnes will run the line in Saturday's Tri-Nations match against South Africa. </p> <p>After two defeats in four games Henry is under renewed scrutiny, only eight months after unexpectedly retaining his job following the All Blacks' worst World Cup campaign. </p> <p>That campaign ended in the quarter-finals, after the referee Barnes failed to spot what looked like a forward pass before a vital French try. Afterwards the Englishman received death threats, while even the International Rugby Board admitted that the All Blacks should have been awarded two crucial penalties in the final minutes, though the board blamed the touch judges not Barnes.</p> <p>New Zealand went into the Tri-Nations series still rankled by Barnes's display. The second-row, Ali Williams, while saying the players had to take some of the blame, criticised Barnes, saying: \"You have to look at the ref: 17 unawarded penalties. That's bullshit.\" </p> <p>Henry yesterday insisted that Barnes's presence would not affect his side and that no extra preparations had been made. \"You cannot do anything about matters outside your control and match officials fall into that category,\" said Henry. \"You just hope they have a good game.\" Asked if he was happy about the appointment, seen as an attempt to reacquaint a leading referee gently with the 2011 World Cup hosts, he replied: \"I am happy to have anybody as an official.\"</p> <p>Barnes is keeping a low profile. \"Wayne has decided not to talk to the media and I support that,\" said the IRB's head of referees, Paddy O'Brien, a New Zealander. </p> <p>Henry has more on his mind than Barnes. Last month's defeat by South Africa in Dunedin has made his position vulnerable. Although the All Blacks currently top the Tri-Nations table, they have finished their home programme and have played one match more than Australia and South Africa.</p> <p>Meanwhile Leicester's southern hemisphere influence increased yesterday when the Tigers' South African head coach, Heyneke Meyer, appointed the Australian Matt O'Connor to take charge of the backs. Responding to criticism of a perceived lack of imagination behind the scrum last year, Meyer said: \"Matt has proved himself with Australia A and the ACT Brumbies, who have one of the best back lines in world rugby.\"</p> <p>Worcester have recruited the Welsh international referee Hugh Watkins as a consultant, helping especially with the new experimental law variations.

The weekend he decided one of his blogs, <a href=\"http://www.Staygolinks.com\">Staygolinks.com</a>, needed a cleanup was the same time a hacker chose to splatter the site with a host of unwanted pages.</p> <p>\"I was doing something I don't normally do: changing the theme of the blog. But it turned out that it was just after the hacker had got in,\" says Welford.</p> <p>As he went through the software that drives his Wordpress-based blog, he found a block of code he didn't recognise. Its job was to subvert the engine that drives Wordpress and generate page after page of links to sites that purport to sell prescription drugs.</p> <p>\"It really was clever programming,\" he says. \"He or she was creating a web-page factory within my website that probably, within about 24 hours, created a few thousand pages. Every time a search engine came in, it would build a new link.\"</p> <p><strong>Bad medicine</strong></p> <p>As an internet marketing consultant, Welford is one of a growing number who finds that blogging makes a site more visible to the search engines. But that in turn attracts criminals who want to hijack the traffic that comes with having a high page rank with Google and other search sites.</p> <p>\"It was amazing. I had the site fixed within 48 hours. But, even a week or two after that, if you did a search for some of these things, my website came up as number one, two, three.\"</p> <p>Hackers do not just redirect surfers to Viagra vendors. They will inject code into blog pages that then try to dump password sniffers and other malware on to visitors' computers. Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at Sophos, says: \"We are seeing more and more websites becoming infected. We count 16,000 new malicious web pages every day. It's one every five seconds. And 90% of them are on legitimate sites that have been hacked.\"</p> <p>Richard Archdeacon, one of the members of the Symantec security practice, says automated tools have made it easier than ever to create malware that can capture a user's keystrokes and passwords or help pass control of a user's computer to criminals. The blog has simply become one more way of delivering that malware.</p> <p>\"I would put it down as the emerging market,\" Archdeacon says. It is a phenomenon that has appeared in the past 18 months, but he insists it is just one type of attack among many - although the number of compromised blogs has risen quickly in that time.</p> <p>In July, <a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/malware2\">Sophos reported</a> that Google's blogging site Blogspot.com is now the number one domain for delivering malware.</p> <p>Cluley suggests that 2% of all malware on the web is hosted at Blogspot. He says: \"A lot of that will be the bad guys setting up blogs with malicious content, but some of them will also be sites that have been hacked.\"</p> <p>Security experts reckon weak passwords let in a lot of hackers. But it's not the only way in. In the past year, the open-source blogging software Wordpress became a popular target among hackers, partly because older versions proved vulnerable to attack.</p> <p>Blog-tracking site Technorati saw an increasing number of otherwise legitimate blogs hosting malicious files and pages. So, the engineers behind the site decided to stop including those sites in its listings in the hope that this would encourage bloggers to update their software. \"As bloggers have updated to the patched version of Wordpress, we have seen the number of hacked blogs drop accordingly,\" says Dorion Carroll, vice-president of engineering at Technorati.</p> <p>A big problem for bloggers is working out when their site has been compromised. Hackers do a lot to cover their tracks. \"They want to keep it running, so they want to avoid being a blip on the radar,\" Archdeacon says. The first sign may be when Google removes a blog from its pages or warns that visiting a site may damage your computer.</p> <p>Security consultant and founder of Blogsecurity.net David Kierznowski said there are tools - such as iWatch and Tripwire - that site owners can use to watch for changes to files. \"However, these types of tools are overkill for most blogs. My personal belief is that hosting providers should offer these services.\"</p> <p><strong>Site for sore eyes</strong></p> <p>Some plug-ins for tracking changes to blog pages have appeared recently in response to the growth in attacks. \"They are certainly looking in the right direction,\" Kierznowski says.</p> <p>To keep his sites running, Welford now has a routine based on the observation that hackers tend to hit blogs at weekends, when many of their users will be doing something else. \"On Saturday morning, I do a check of my various blogs. And, on Monday, I do it again,\" he says. \"On the internet, a lot of traffic comes through Google, so you want to be sure you have a good record with them.\"</p>",

  "<p>You'll need to be the master of your money matters and the boss of your budget when you start university this autumn. </p> <p>Not sure how? Don't worry, you'll be cracking your financial whip in no time once you've read this advice from savvy students and finance experts.</p> <p>\"Keep track of every penny from day one and it'll help avoid more serious financial problems later on,\" says Catherine McGrath, director of current accounts at Lloyds TSB. Sound obvious? Even excessive? Maybe, but it works.</p> <p>The way to do it is to keep a weekly, monthly or termly record of everything you buy so that you can see how much you are spending on food, bills and going out. Then you can work out how to cut back. Student welfare advisers can give you an estimate of typical costs if you aren't sure whether you are over-spending on socialising or transport, for example.</p> <p>Set up a separate bank account with a set amount for your day-to-day spending. This way, the money that's meant to last until the end of term does just that.</p> <p>Next, get yourself discounts on train travel and other stuff with a young person's railcard and a National Union of Students (NUS) card. Make it your business to find out about other offers, such as two-for-one meals at restaurants.</p> <p>\"Think about simple things like making a packed lunch rather than buying a sandwich,\" says McGrath. Consider living with your parents for a bit rather than renting.</p> <p>Here's an absolute must: check you are getting all the cash you are entitled to. There are all sorts of bursaries and grants out there. Did you know that, however rich you are, if you went to a school in the London Borough of Haringey and are going on to higher education, you are entitled to some extra money? Ask around and look at <a href=\"http://www.egas-online.org.uk\">egas-online.org.uk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/index.htm\">direct.gov.uk/en/index.htm</a>.</p> <p>\"Be sensible and if you have spent a lot one week, cut back the next,\" says Greg Harradine, who is studying music technology at Kingston University.</p> <p>Before borrowing money, check what the final amount you will have to pay is going to be. It might be useful to see debt in terms of traffic-light colours. Student loans are green because they are pretty safe. Credit cards are orange, so don't overuse them. Store cards and personal unsecured loans are red because they have outrageous rates of interest and steep repayments.</p> <p>\"Keep an eye on how much tax you are paying,\" says David Malcolm, a student finance researcher at the NUS. \"If you earn less than the personal allowance, reclaim your tax.\"</p> <p>And why not make money from your hobby? Harradine earns \u00a318 an hour teaching African jamming in schools.

His five jobs include giving guitar lessons, operating rides at Chessington World of Adventures theme park, working in a pub and demonstrating products outside shops.</p> <p>His advice, not surprisingly, is to get a job while you are at university, but also to pay by cash rather than card. \"That way you keep more of an eye on what you are spending.\" </p> <p><strong>Income per month</strong></p> <p>Jobs: (He saves \u00a3300 of this) \u00a3580 </p> <p>Loans: \u00a30</p> <p><strong>Total: \u00a3580</strong></p> <p><strong>Outgoings per month</strong></p> <p>Rent: (Leon lives at home) \u00a30 </p> <p>Phone bill: \u00a320</p> <p>Transport: \u00a340</p> <p>Socialising: \u00a3120</p> <p>Presents/holidays: \u00a337.50</p> <p>Course books/photocopies: \u00a30</p> <p><strong>Total: \u00a3217.50</strong></p> <p><strong>Katherine Johnston, 20, from Essex</strong>, started a fine art degree at Kingston University just a year ago.

That's partly because she's making about \u00a3100 a year on eBay, selling the T-shirts she designs.

  "<h2>Kristian Digby, presenter of BBC1's To Buy or Not to Buy</h2> <p><strong>University of Westminster <br>Film, video and photographic arts (1995-98)<br>Degree: 2:1</strong></p> <p>My first year was quite an experience. Being meek and from the West Country, suddenly living in a house-share in London with 15 other students was a shock. </p> <p>Our house was the most unhygienic property I have ever been in. For some reason, we were obsessed with filling the house with \"objets de street art\". I remember coming down one day and finding a whole bus shelter (later joined by a bus stop). </p> <p>I was a bit geeky and hadn't caught on to not washing or ironing clothes. I would press my slacks before lectures. But we had a real rat problem, and the landlord brought in Rentokil. I will never forget going to pull out my iron from the kitchen cupboard and realising a rat had rotted over the iron cord. It put me off ironing for a long, long time. </p> <p>I really enjoyed my course, but for me the really great thing about uni was learning to be in London, how to be an adult, to cook, to go out socialising - and I also discovered my sexuality.</p> <p><strong>Top tip</strong> My sister gave me a Student Emergency Kit - full of things like vitamins and a \u00a320 note in an envelope that said \"Do not open except in emergency\" - and it really did save my life on a number of occasions. And don't eat the maggots in the tequila bottle. No matter how funny it seems. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Kristian's new series, Double Agents, will be shown on the BBC in August</p> <h2>Jody Furlong, presenter of BBC3's Find me the Face</h2> <p><strong>University of East London <br>Media studies (1992-95) <br>Degree 2:2</strong></p> <p>To be honest, university wasn't my highest priority. But when I was doing my A-levels, I had a panic when I realised that the alternative was to get a job. </p> <p>I moved from Maidstone in Kent. From the minute I got to London, it was about clubbing and going out. My fondest memory from that whole period - this is so gay - is meeting Naomi Campbell in a nightclub. </p> <p>In the last semester, I realised that I was going to get a third and I was mortified. I knuckled down, and once I started going to lectures I started to really enjoy it. So my regret is that I didn't work harder. </p> <p><strong>Top tip</strong> You'll never get some opportunities again because you'll be at work. So if you want to go out clubbing every night, go for it - but make sure you make the most of the people you meet. </p> <h2>Judge Jules, Radio 1 DJ</h2> <p><strong>London School of Economics<br>Law (1986-88)<br>Degree: 2:1</strong></p> <p>I was from London and went to university there, so in my first year all my mates who hadn't gone on gap years were still around and that gave me a real advantage. I didn't feel the pressure to meet people straight away. </p> <p>I did get very involved in running the clubbing side of the student union. I was very keen on the DJ side of things, not least because it got me free records. </p> <p>The most significant thing was moving away from home. In my case it was very emotional because my mother died a month after I went to university - I had just left home for the first time. </p> <p>I never actually practised law, but some aspects of my degree have proven invaluable in running a small business. But I was putting on illegal raves throughout university. </p> <p><strong>Top tip</strong> Involve yourself and explore - pucker up your chest, get out there and enjoy your new home. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Judge Jules's show is on Radio 1, Saturday mornings 1-3am </p> <h2>Ed Smith, captain of Middlesex Cricket Club</h2> <p><strong>Peterhouse, Cambridge (1995-98)<br>History<br>Degree: Double 1st</strong></p> <p>The first few days everyone is feeling their way around each other, and everyone's behaviour is pretty embarrassing. </p> <p>The university is very keen that people don't slip through the net and become lonely, so every minute is accounted for, but the idea that they would provide a structure for us to get to know each other really didn't appeal. And sportsmen spend so much of their time in enforced sociability that I didn't need more of it.</p> <p>I was lucky because I was at a small college and there just weren't enough sportsmen to create a clique. I ended up with friends from all over the place. I'm still in touch with my closest friends from Peterhouse, Rob Ashforth and Jonathan Shapiro. In the first year, the three of us lived in a late regency terrace, St Peter's Terrace - I had a bedroom on the top floor and a sitting room downstairs, and I installed a phone, which in those days was very exotic. </p> <p>I enjoyed Cambridge life and the people who taught me history - notably Tim Blanning, Brendan Simms and John Adamson. John was a great don to know because his gift was to make academic life unintimidating and encourage irreverence. </p> <p><strong>Top tip</strong> Knowing too many people is far more problematic than too few, so bide your time. And be yourself, because it will be one of the few times when you really can be. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Ed Smith's latest book, What Sport Tells Us About Life: Bradman's Average, Zidane's Kiss and Other Sporting Lessons is published by Viking</p> <h2>Tamsin Greig, actor</h2> <p><strong>Birmingham University (1985-89)<br>Drama and theatre arts<br>Degree: 1st</strong></p> <p>I wasn't a great adventurer to be honest. I was quite fearful of going away from home - we were quite a connected family and I spent the first week or so very puffy-eyed. </p> <p>I lived in an all-girls' hall because I had been at an all-girls school and the idea of being near boys filled me with terror. It was very nice, everyone ate together and watched EastEnders and Blackadder - and it meant that I didn't have to look at any boys. I did actually have a long-term boyfriend, but I still didn't know how to actually talk to boys.</p> <p>There were so many clubs and societies you could join. It was a bit like being in a candy shop - I did trampolining for a bit. </p> <p>The course at Birmingham was, and is, great - it's the most practical academic course you can do, so we did lighting, stage management and a lot of performance in the second and third year. </p> <p>Although I found freshers' week difficult, it has stood me in good stead because it is exactly like any first week on set. </p> <p><strong>Top tip</strong> Smile. Make eye-contact. And always be the first one to offer to buy someone a drink. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Tamsin Greig will appear in a monologue, Always the Teacher Never the Bride on Teachers' TV, August 19 at 8pm </p> <h2>Josie Long, comedian</h2> <p><strong>Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford (2000-03) <br>English language and literature:<br>\"I don't want to say what I got in my degree - I disappointed myself - but I got a first in my dissertation!\"</strong></p> <p>My college was in a really beautiful Victorian building, but I drew the short straw. Some people had amazingly beautiful rooms looking out on to a sunken garden, with an ensuite - but I was in an attic with paper-thin walls and a sink in the cupboard. </p> <p>I found it hard to get up in the morning, hard not to put on weight from drinking, hard not to leave things to the last minute. There were lots of things that were really good about being at Oxford. I lived next to a park and the river. The libraries were amazing - you could order up these 17th-century popular magazines and they would just turn up in a box for you. And all the people were really ambitious and driven, but not in a gross way - so it was really inspiring. </p> <p><strong>Top tip</strong> Ask for help if you need it - don't be scared of seeming stupid. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Josie Long will be appearing at the Edinburgh Festival, The Pleasance, until August 25</p> <h2>Alfonso Sharland, band member of The Hoosiers</h2> <p><strong>London Met University (2001-04)<br>Mass communication and creative writing<br>Degree: 2:1</strong></p> <p>I knew Irwin [Sparkes, fellow member of The Hoosiers] from home, and that made it easier, but everyone was really friendly, and being in halls helps because you can all go and watch Neighbours together. We soon had a big gang.</p> <p>I wasn't too bad at budgeting. I got a big loan, which is now weighing round my neck, but I always worked as well. I made lots of friends and I'm still in touch with quite a few - and now there's Facebook, they all come back to get you.</p> <p><strong>Top tip</strong> Mashed potato with tuna and Dolmio sauce.</p> <h2>Lucy Porter, comedian</h2> <p><strong>Manchester University (1991-94)<br>English language and literature<br>Degree: 2:1</strong></p> <p>I picked Manchester because I liked the Stone Roses (I also liked the Wonderstuff, but I'm pleased I didn't go to Wolverhampton). I thought it would be a fun place, and it was. But in the first week it rained so heavily, I thought I'd made a terrible mistake and had a bit of a cry.</p> <p>I hung out with a lot of people from my course, and because I was an indie kid, that's who I gravitated towards. We found all the indie hangouts and I also got into the Manchester comedy scene, going to see Steve Coogan and Caroline Ahern. </p> <p>I also acquired my taste for strong liquor. One of the first nights, I drank more Bailey's than a human being should ever consume, though really no one should drink more than one glass. </p> <p><strong>Top tip</strong> Don't be petty about people using your milk and never write notes and put them in the fridge. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Lucy Porter will be appearing at the Edinburgh Festival, Pleasance Courtyard, until August 25</p> <h2>Brendan Mackey, actor whose credits include BBC's Life On Mars, Casualty and the film Touching The Void</h2> <p><strong>Open University<br>BA (Hons) literature<br>Degree: ongoing</strong></p> <p>I always fancied doing an academic degree, but couldn't see how I'd fit a course around my job. The great thing about the Open University (OU) is that it's so flexible. It's about 15 hours' study a week. When I'm away on location, I just take the work with me, sit in my caravan or hotel room and get on with it. This year, I'll be writing a piece of coursework in Bangkok and sitting my final exam in LA. </p> <p>I trained as an actor at Rada, but it was a very practical course. After more than 10 years away from studying, it took a while to get back into it, but I've really enjoyed it. On my current grades, I'm heading for a first, but I'll be happy if I get a 2:1. I can now talk about things I could never have talked about before. </p> <p><strong>Top tip</strong> If you have a passion for the subject, you can weather the tough times.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Brendan Mackey stars in the horror film Paintball, to be released in 2009.

The same research revealed marked differences between subjects.</p> <p>Since 2000 A-levels have been modular, which means that rather than just taking one final exam at the end of the year pupils learn in smaller chunks over shorter periods, do more coursework, and can resit papers. Pupils were encouraged to take up to five AS levels in their first year, then drop the subjects they fared less well in for the A-level year. This helped them do better at A-level and triggered the dramatic rise. </p> <p>Alan Smithers, professor of education at the University of Buckingham, says: \"There's been considerable levelling down to make A-levels more accessible to a much broader range of abilities and to serve a much bigger higher education system.\"</p> <p>Geoff Parks, head of admissions at Cambridge University, says these structural changes have affected pupils' knowledge. \"The essay questions tell you the factors you should consider, instead of allowing you to decide what the important factors are. There is strong evidence that it's now easier to get an A, but it won't feel like that to the students, who are under more pressure than their parents ever knew.\"</p> <p><strong>Where is the pressure from?</strong></p> <p>To mark themselves out in an expanded education system, students have to get top grades to be considered for the most competitive university courses. </p> <p>Smithers says: \"From the point of view of pupils the exams are harder because they are more competitive. It's not enough to get a pass or a C. You need an A or three As to get into the top university.\" Last year Oxford turned away 5,000 students who went on to get three As at A-level. </p> <p>Students work harder than ever and their schools know more about how to help them. Mike Cresswell, head of the largest exam board, the AQA, says: \"I would say modern kids are better prepared for the exams. I would expect them to score more highly as a result.\"</p> <p>Some also point to pressure between the three main exam boards as something that has pushed grades up. Edexcel caused controversy by saying that its philosophy was \"aimed at increasing student attainment across all grades\". Critics said this conflicted with its responsibility to set objective exams.</p> <p><strong>What about at school level?</strong></p> <p>Under pressure to move up the league tables, schools have to be ever more ruthless about getting top grades out of students. Sixth forms - even comprehensives - are increasingly selective. One senior headteacher says this means some ease out pupils who have been at their school from 11-16 if they do not score well at GCSE.</p> <p>\"Certainly they are on dodgy ground with the code of admissions, but this undoubtedly happens in the top state schools that want to get the best results,\" he said. Students are also pressured to drop subjects after AS level if it appears they are not going to score highly in them at A-level, even if they really enjoy them.</p> <p><strong>What happens to pupils who do not do A-levels?</strong></p> <p>Only 44% of 16-year-olds do A-levels. Others go on to vocational training, work, or join the flock of so-called \"Neets\" - young people \"not currently engaged in employment, education or training\". Research by the Conservatives, published today, reveals how strongly that is tied to location. In Sandwell, West Bromwich, only 10.5% study A-levels, whereas in Barnet, north London, 83.25% do. Knowsley, Merseyside, has more Neets than A-level students among 16- and 17-year-olds.</p> <p><strong>What is being reformed in September?</strong></p> <p>The current six-module A-level system will be replaced with four modules, in order to give pupils more depth in their learning. Exams will test pupils on their accumulated knowledge, rather than the term-sized modular chunks which are said to encourage narrowly-focused drilling. New questions designed to stretch the most able students will be introduced, and success in these will be rewarded with a new A*.</p> <p>The first of the diplomas will be taught to about 20,000 students. The new qualifications will encompass GCSEs and A-levels, and the government has said it hopes they will become the \"qualification of choice\". </p> <p><strong>Will the A* help?</strong></p> <p>It is proving controversial. The best universities are concerned it will tighten the grip of the top state, grammar and independent schools, which dominate their applications, and undermine their attempts to attract more pupils from lower performing schools in poorer areas. Oxford has said it will not make offers based on A*s in 2010, the first year they are awarded, to allow it time to analyse the distribution of these grades between schools.</p> <p>Others are more hopeful. Parks says: \"If the stretch and challenge in the questions does what they are meant to, no amount of drilling will help less able students. It may be the A* could help identify the best students regardless of their educational background.\"</p>",
  "<p>Tennyson wrote that \"bright and fierce and fickle is the South/And dark and true and tender is the North\". I'm not sure whether the rightwing wonks at the Policy Exchange thinktank are any brighter or fiercer than we northerners but they are certainly more fickle than a teenage pop fan. This week, said body published a report arguing that the regeneration of the north was largely a doomed and failing endeavour, and that the best thing to do would be to encourage us all to move to that unspoilt and spacious corner of England, the south-east, where once we had arrived on the backs of trucks in dusty clothes like Henry Fonda in The Grapes of Wrath, we could all be smartened up and given jobs, perhaps as footmen.</p> <p>Forgive me if I exaggerate for comic and splenetic effect. \"Fickle\" hardly does it justice. Policy Exchange is the Conservatives' favourite thinktank and, unless my grasp of history is feebler than I fear, it was successive Conservative governments who did their damnedest to put the north in a position from which it needed to recover. Now they say that we are to be written off - and would the last person to leave Sunderland please switch off the lights?</p> <p>I went to Sunderland for my book Pies and Prejudice, along with Liverpool, Bradford and many another poor, benighted hole, as Policy Exchange would doubtless have it. As the people dashed hither and thither from boutique hotel to graphic design studios grabbing a panini and frappuccino as they went, they certainly didn't look any more washed-out or hopeless than the haunted, sallow wraiths who ride the Northern line or any more criminal or indolent than the pimply youths of Peckham or the Blackbird Leys estate in Oxford (where, according to Policy Exchange, the people of Liverpool and Bradford should decamp in search of a new life).</p> <p>When Boris Johnson said scousers had a tendency to self-pity and sentimentality in the wake of Ken Bigley's murder, the outcry was swift and loud. Many of my Liverpudlian mates though said, wryly and sotto voce, that he may have had a point. Policy Exchange's is a different order of foolishness: not a glib and badly timed faux-pas but vapid opinion, masquerading as research. We may never make ships or dig coal again - which is a tragedy - but anyone who has walked along the new Tyne riverscape, stayed at the Lowry Hotel, Manchester, or lounged at the fabled pavement cafes of Leeds will know that, as the Fall once predicted, the north has risen again.</p> <h2>The people </h2> <p>To quote the comedian Graham Fellows (aka John Shuttleworth): \"It's nice up north.\" By \"it\" he might reasonably be taken to mean \"everything\", but the observation is particularly true of the people.</p> <p>I grew up in York and return there often. As I take a taxi from the station to my dad's house I am monitoring the driver, comparing him with his London counterparts. We might come up behind a slow, wavering cyclist, an old man who keeps veering towards the middle of the road. Being still attuned to London etiquette, I am braced for the driver to launch an assault on the cyclist: perhaps he'll draw alongside and spit at him, as a London taxi driver once did to me. But no, the driver continues in benign silence. (Whereas in London there are only surly silences, in the north there are many kinds).</p> <p>If we pull up next to the bicyclist at a light, the driver won't glare at him, but crane forward to scan the sky while observing that \"It's brightening up nicely.\" If the cyclist persists in blocking the road, the driver might give vent to a long sigh, accompanied by a drawn-out, \"Eeee ...\" A bit later, he might mutter, \"Get a shift on, granddad,\" but the window will be kept up. </p> <p>Whereas your cockney is a natural extrovert, shouting his wares from his fruit barrow, the northerner, raised in a less individualistic society, is more inward and abstracted. Even expressions of irritation are likely to be abstracted, quasi-philosophical: \"He's a right one, he is\", or \"Well, I'll go to our 'ouse ...\" </p> <p>A lingering industrial culture produces a sense that we are all in this together. A butcher's in York has chairs so that old people can sit down while their mince is being bagged. And all across the north, you can traverse a zebra crossing at your leisure without a craven thumbs-up to the driver who has deigned to obey the law by stopping, which is now the norm in London. </p> <p>Amiability is hard-wired into northern discourse by the use of \"pet\" and \"love\". </p> <p>I have taken a slow pleasure in realising that being in my 40s is no barrier to northern female shop assistants using these endearments while serving me. And in some pockets of the north the men \"love\" each other. I once interviewed Anthony Burgess, who was born in Manchester. At the end of our talk, he asked me how old I was. I told him 26 and he said, \"You've got it all before you, love.\" </p> <p>To go north is to be checked by salutary experiences: the shopkeeper who, when asked the way to a particular street, steps out of his shop the better to direct you; the woman on the train who gives you a conspiratorial smile as you tell some feeble joke to your children. If the north ever does become economically unviable, it might at least function as a standing moral corrective to the south.</p> <p><strong>Andrew Martin</strong></p> <h2>The arts</h2> <p>Years ago, when I told anyone that I was a music journalist based in the north, they'd trill back, \"However do you cope, when everything happens in London?\" It felt like that once but not any more. Arenas in Sheffield, Manchester and Newcastle (a Leeds counterpart is next) mean that superstar bands are no longer the province of Wembley or the occasional northern football ground. Interviewing famous bands doesn't mean travelling to London, because they stay up north, where they can enjoy anonymity along with the internet, electricity and even gas. Kaiser Chiefs may have stretched a point when they proclaimed \"Everything's brilliant in Leeds\", but the city's well-established annual pop festival has a lot less mud than Glastonbury and no stilt-walking crazy hippies. </p> <p>Of course, the best music has always been created in the north. Morrissey's Manchester (\"so much to answer for\") is a constant production line of classic British pop. Bands as glorious and diverse as the Hollies, Joy Division, New Order, Buzzcocks, the Smiths, the Stone Roses, Oasis and Salford's Fall have poured out as smoothly as a pint of Boddingtons. Even Northside had their fans.</p> <p>Liverpool - the European City of Culture, lest we forget - has given us Echo and the Bunnymen, the La's and (Dead or Alive's) Pete Burns' evolving facial structure, an artwork in itself. And the most significant musical phenomenon of the 20th century happened up north. But enough about the Hacienda and acid house - the Fab Four were from Merseyside, you know. And who are the hottest, most currently influential band in Britain? Arctic Monkeys. Not from the stockbroker belt, but estates in Sheffield and Rotherham.</p> <p>Northern literary giants range from Armley butcher's son Alan Bennett to Leeds lad Tony Harrison. Leeds has its own International Film Festival, while the city-based Opera North has won plenty of awards to sing about. The fantastic West Yorkshire Playhouse, built in 1990, is the largest regional repertory theatre in the UK outside London and Stratford. Granted, the north does not have Tate Modern - but the purpose-built Henry Moore and Lowry galleries house the works of great northern artists. Meanwhile, where better to experience the drama of classical music than futuristic venues such as Manchester's Bridgewater Hall and Gateshead's Sage? And of course, Manchester houses Britain's longest-established symphony orchestra, the 151-year-old Hall\u00e9.</p> <p><strong>Dave Simpson</strong></p> <h2>The countryside</h2> <p>They call it the Backbone of England - the vast line of exquisite hills and dales that bisects the north country and includes not one, not two, but three national parks - areas of outstanding natural beauty, stretching from the Derbyshire Peaks, through Yorkshire and up to Northumberland and forming the lungs of those still great industrial cities of Newcastle, Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield.</p> <p>For more than half of my life the Pennines have been my back garden and the playground for me and my children. When I was a youngster, my father and I would pile into his old A35 van, leave the grime of our little home town of Barnsley, still a prosperous centre of mining and boasting the best market for miles around, and in 10 minutes be scrambling over rocks, tramping through sweet-scented heather and paddling in the clearest of cool mountain streams. </p> <p>We would sing the Ewan McColl Manchester Rambler song, inspired by the stunning scenery around us: \"Sooner than part from the mountains / I think I would rather be dead .../ I may be a wage slave on Monday/ but I am a free man on Sunday.\" </p> <p>Our favourite book was Wuthering Heights and we would picture Cathy and Heathcliffe, carried away by the romance of the landscape that could change within seconds from the darkest of satanic hills to the greenest, gentlest rolling valleys.</p> <p>I left for a while, lured south to the metropolitan shark pool where talent would either sink or swim, and endured the suffocating atmosphere of phenomenally costly back-to-back terrace houses - taking our boys to play football and fall off their bikes in the dog dirt-infested parks and commons of the capital.</p> <p>We had to come home. We bought a house on the edge of the Derbyshire Peaks and sat, gazing with wonder at the view from our kitchen window. Nothing but trees, grass and rumbling sheep. We felt we were on holiday and might have to hand the keys back at the end of the week. We still hug each other with delight at the sheer joy of what surrounds us.</p> <p>Our children grew up fit and strong, leaping into the crystal-clear pools at Three Shires Head, galloping horses over wide open spaces and running out at night to gaze in awe at a harvest moon or bright stars unsullied by light pollution. </p> <p>My mother, on her rare visits to London, would always complain that it was too hot and stuffy down south - a coat warmer than in Yorkshire. It's got worse as the globe heats and this suffocating summer I've boarded the train at Euston with eager anticipation of being able to fill my lungs with freshness. I drive up into the hills of home and breathe in the breeze.</p> <p>I have left behind the dissembling, overblown, grubby, stuck-up south and arrived back where I belong; where it's clean, spiky, tough, straightforward, unpretentious and beautiful. Pay northerners to move south? </p> <p>As Prince Charles might say, count me out.</p> <p><strong>Jenni Murray</strong></p> <h2>The style</h2> <p>There is a Michael Grigsby film from 1962, named Tomorrow's Saturday, that gives a glimpse of life in the Lancashire mill-towns of Preston and Blackburn. It begins in the mills, women working the looms, lip-reading over the clatter of the machines, wearing pinafores and housecoats, faces pale and plain, attending to the warp and the weft, back and forth, until the factory whistle goes. \"Tomorrow,\" a woman's voice then tells us, \"is Saturday.\" </p> <p>What Saturday brings, along with the football and the launderette, the washing of the front step and the window panes, is a transformation in these women. We catch them at the market, eyeing the strands of beads, the fancy frocks, the box marked \"Washable polythene roses\". Later, we see them at the pub, all dolled up, wearing posh hats, fancy jewellery, plush coats, hair set, faces rouged and painted, drinking halves and singing along to the piano: \"I'm gonna rock, rock, rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham.\"</p> <p>When I first moved to the south-east from Wigan in 1997, the thing that struck me (along with the milky tea, the rubbish chips and southerners' singular inability to pronounce the word \"bath\") was how thoroughly half-arsed people down here are at getting dolled up of a night. They go out on the town straight from work in their same weary outfits, a smear of lipgloss and unkempt hair. I felt like a cuckoo, laid in another bird's nest, my feathers all the wrong colours to fit in.</p> <p>People laugh at us for our northern style, as if we are great, over-egged puddings. They point at Coleen Rooney, Cheryl Cole, Alex Curran as if they are figures of fun for their extravagant outfits, their carrier bags from Cricket and Flannels, their fake tan and groomed hair. But it's different where we're from: in the north, we make an effort. We go home, we eat our tea, we get dolled up; only then do we go out. </p> <p>I'd wager it has something to do with the jobs we've traditionally worked and the lives we've lived, about those same pinafored women in Grigsby's film, working like drudges and waiting for Saturday night. It's about the joy of getting dressed, about preening ourselves and looking the best that we possibly can - which is why, famously, we never wear coats, even when it's ruddy freezing and we're wearing next to nothing.</p> <p>It's a style that is discernibly, unapologetically northern. Oh, we're bigger than you, and we've not so much class, no money, no ponies, no foie gras for tea. But there's a heart to northern style - there's no guile, no side, only great spangly fake-tanned joy. </p> <p>There's a song that plays over Tomorrow's Saturday, as the women peruse the market stalls. I think it's called Come Along In, and it dwells on the challenges of northern life: \"You know a young fella puts up for MP/ Chattered so hard that convinced me/ Sitting so pretty, now we don't see his face/ Mebbe he thinks London's a much better place.\" Aye, Mr Cameron, 'appen he does.</p> <p><strong>Laura Barton</strong></p> <h2>The humour</h2> <p>Twenty years ago, when I was just out of my teens, I moved to Manchester from Cardiff. </p> <p>I planned to stay for just the summer. On my first day I caught the bus into town. There was a harassed teenage mother standing at the bus stop. Her toddler kept wandering away from her. Finally, after various entreaties, she yelled at her kid, \"If you keep doing that some strange man will take you!\"</p> <p>Then, unexpectedly, she turned to me and looked me in the eye.</p> <p>\"Although he'd no doubt bloody well bring her back again,\" she drawled, laconically.</p> <p>I was too uptight to think of anything funny to say back, and so instead I just got on the bus. I sat behind a teenage girl and her boyfriend. Each time the bus passed a blue car the girl murmured, \"Blue!\" and whacked her boyfriend on the back of his head with a newspaper.</p> <p>After a while we passed a bus depot. \"Now let's play 'bus',\" the girl said. \"Bus!\" Whack. \"Bus!\" Whack. \"Bus!\" Whack.</p> <p>These were not especially funny things to witness on a bus and so it might seem odd that I'd remember this journey so clearly after 20 years. But it's because it was all so sweet and charming and funny and in such contrast to the bus journeys I'd taken all my life in Cardiff, where the kids in my class had a running joke of yelling \"Slag!\" at the girls who'd slept with them until they ran from the bus in shame. I was so taken with the snippets of warm-hearted, dry, low-key humour I overheard on the bus that day that I fell in love with Manchester and stayed for nearly 10 years.</p> <p>I don't know why the standard of public, throwaway humour is so much higher in the north than in the south, but it is. Maybe northerners aren't in such a hurry. The need to earn big money isn't so acute. When you're in a hurry, all you think about is whatever you're rushing to. Or maybe there are more things to suffer in the north - the weather, poverty etc. Success is always less funny than failure.</p> <p>Now I live in London, where people on buses are tense and late and they tend to stare at the floor and not make eye-contact. But not long ago I was in Ilkley, getting a local train across the moor. A bunch of school kids got on. They were quite rowdy and a few pensioners looked grumpily at them. The kids must have come from orchestra practice because one of them had a trombone in a case. The others dared him to take it out. So he did. He put it to his lips. The other passengers looked horrified and steeled themselves for something awful. The boy played it, beautifully, and - I swear - it was one of the loveliest sounds I've ever heard.</p> <p><strong>Jon Ronson</strong></p> <h2>The sport</h2> <p>Just one question. Would Tim Leunig, co-author of the report stating that all northern losers had better move south if they want to make anything of their lives, be happy to tell Sunderland manager Roy Keane \"It is time to stop pretending there is a bright future for Sunderland\"? To his face?</p> <p>Actually, one more question. Would Tim Leunig, of the London School of Economics (a much esteemed southern institution), be willing to tell Hull City's legendary forward and ex-brickie Dean \"Deano\" Windass that coastal cities such as Hull are \"almost always at the end of the line\"? To his face? No, I thought not.</p> <p>The amazing thing about this report is that it makes even less sense sport-wise than it does socio-economically. Most of the places it cites are thriving. Hull City are in the Premiership for the first time, Sunderland averaged gates of 43,000 last year, Liverpool look set for their best Premiership challenge in 19 years, and Blackpool were promoted to the Championship in 2007. Even poor Scunthorpe, who are newly relegated, won the first division championship the season before, their greatest season ever.</p> <p>Arsenal, Chelsea, Spurs - where were they when the league was founded in 1888? Nowhere, madam. Of the 12 founders, six were indisputably northern, and the other half-dozen were Midlands-based, which we can all agree is more north than south.</p> <p>As for 2005 and England's Ashes victory, that would be just another southern fantasy. The equation is simple. No Freddie Flintoff (Lancashire) + no Michael Vaughan and Matthew Hoggard (Yorkshire) + no Steve Harmison (Durham) = no Ashes.</p> <p>Wipe out the north and there would be no Grand National, regarded by many as the world's greatest horse race, no rugby league, remarkably little fell walking (hello, the Lake District), and almost certainly no darts (we salute you, fair folk of Grimsby, who gave us the beautiful game back in the middle ages).</p> <p>Whippet racing, pigeon fancying, kestrel training (not an official sport, I know, but the way Billy Casper handled his bird in Kes it definitely should be) - none would have been quite as prestigious as they are today. Cheese skittle throwing would not have been so much as a twinkle in Freddie Trueman's eye, and Cumberland wrestling (yes, the one where wrestlers stand chest to chest, each grasping the other with locked hands around the body, each opponent's chin on the other's right - no sausage involved) would be virtually unheard of.</p> <p>Finally, we would have to bid a fond farewell to ferret legging. And a world in which men (and women) no longer placed two ferrets in their trousers, then firmly tied their trouser cuffs to their ankles to ensure no escape, would be a much poorer one. </p> <p>The world champion ferret legger is thought to be a retired miner, Reg Mellor, who \"kept 'em down\" (a technical term) for five hours and 26 minutes.</p> <p><strong>Simon Hattenstone</strong></p> <h2>The politics</h2> <p>When 200 men took part in the Jarrow march from Tyneside to London in 1936 they were demanding work and investment in the shipbuilding, coal and steel industries. In the great sweep of our history, though, they were also participating in a role the north has long played in politics: that of the nation's conscience.</p> <p>Britain likes to define itself as democratic, but our democracy wasn't presented to the people on a plate: it was fought for, and the north has always been at the front line of that battle. In the early 19th century - before universal suffrage - Manchester was a hotbed of campaigns for parliamentary reform. At the Peterloo massacre of 1819, 15 demonstrators were killed - ordinary working people who had the temerity to demand voting rights. </p> <p>Later in the century, the cause of reform was taken up by the Chartists, who derived most of their strength from the north, and by the suffragettes. The north was giving voice to the dispossessed, through political action and radical organisation (the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, founded in 1844, was the first successful co-operative enterprise).</p> <p>More recently, the political agenda formed in London still seems intent on writing off the north, as in the 1980s when Margaret Thatcher went to war with the miners. Sheffield styled itself the People's Republic of South Yorkshire: recognition that the ideological distance between London and the north has often been further than the geographical one. That joyful sense of independence is now even more widespread.</p> <p>Away from the centre of political power, the north is always in danger of being sidelined, or erased, whether by cavalry charges, hard-faced economic policy or by top-down models of regeneration. But the political values driven by the north remind us of the importance of alternative voices and close-knit communities, and most of all, give us soul.</p> <p><strong>Dave Haslam</strong></p> <h2>The food</h2> <p>It's easy to see why reports condemning vast swathes of the north occasionally emanate from the south. You simply can't get good, or even sub-standard, parkin anywhere south of Birmingham and I think this imbalances the brain. When you factor in that there's no black peas, it's a wonder southerners don't go completely insane. I'm willing to bet that if they could just sit down with a good pot of tea (Yorkshire or Lancashire) and a thick end slice of parkin - the bit where the mixture has hardened ever so slightly but retains the cake's essential moisture - then we'd see an end to these lamentable lapses of concentration. </p> <p>Of course, parkin, black peas and the universe's greatest cups of tea are but amuses-bouches when compared to the groaning buffet that fills northern tables. Strike out the north and you lose some of the country's finest foods: lancashire cheese, Bury black pudding, cumberland sausages, yorkshire curd tarts, steamed puddings, Wigan's pies; I'd go on but my keyboard is becoming a drool marshland.</p> <p>Naturally, all these dishes rely on access to the highest-quality produce and between Cumbria, Lancashire, Northumbria, Yorkshire and Cheshire you can source some of the best red meat, dairy and vegetables in the country. Great heavens, you could write epic poetry about the quality of rhubarb from Yorkshire's rhubarb triangle alone! </p> <p>The epithet that northern food sometimes gets labelled with is \"honest\". That's often used pejoratively to mean that northern food is uncomplicated and naive. I don't necessarily think that's wrong, I just don't think it's an insult. Northern food is primarily about simple things done well with incredible produce. In the south, you're more likely to see things becoming needlessly overcomplicated. Take pies. The north makes beautiful, knee-trembling pies - wonderful chunks of flavoursome Cumbrian beef, swimming in a gravy so rich it could afford to buy a two-bedroomed flat in London, all parcelled in buttery pastry that somehow manages to be simultaneously dense and light. When I was down south recently, someone tried to sell me a Thai-fusion pie. My northern heart bled gravy for the south that day.</p> <p><strong>Andrew Shanahan</strong></p> <h2>The coasts</h2> <p>When the Vikings invaded the north, they didn't rampage inland as they did down south. They stopped, looked around and agreed: \"You can't get much better than this. Let's build Scarborough.\"</p> <p>The feeling persists: even if we all have to go and live in Witney thanks to Policy Exchange, we will come back to the north's golden rim every summer with our buckets, spades and entry forms for holiday camp and beach competitions.</p> <p>There are plentiful glories inland (and plenty of jobs, excellent housing, swanky restaurants, cool clubs et al), but the thousands of miles by the north's two seas are extra special. Start where the Eden spills into the Solway Firth, dawdling to watch the ancient Norse skill of haaf-netting migrating salmon. Finish at Berwick-upon-Tweed after visiting the saintly shrines and comic puffins of the Farne Islands.</p> <p>The idea that this is all doomed and unwanted is lunatic. Blackpool is still the most visited tourist attraction in Britain; all the Yorkshire resorts have seen visitor numbers rise so far this summer. It isn't just kiss-me-quick hats and teacups sliced vertically in half (because \"you only asked for half a cup\") either. It's the world's second most performed playwright after Shakespeare, Sir Alan Ayckbourn, resolutely forcing the London critics to come to Scarborough every time he premieres a production at the Stephen Joseph theatre.</p> <p>None of this is to disrespect the charms of Durdle Door in Dorset or the wonderful Seven Sisters marching east from Cuckmere Haven. But there is one definite north-south difference: as in so much else, you are far more likely to have the golden sands or giddy cliffs to yourself. The big resorts apart, the coast shares the wide-open, uncluttered feel that is such an attraction of the north in general.</p> <p>Variety is the other thing. You like unusual pebbles? Spurn Point in east Yorkshire vies with Chesil Beach. Flatlands make you calm? You can't do better than Sunk Island, the strange \"new Yorkshire\" that is still accumulating from sand and shingle washed into the Humber.</p> <p>That's the coast I know best, but it's the same on the \"wrong\", Lancastrian side. Antony Gormley has set his bold northern mark in the foreshore at Crosby every bit as firmly as beside the A1 at Gateshead. St Bee was a match for the Vikings when she drifted ashore from Ireland on her raft. The Lake District mountains, no less, reared mistily ahead of her, but she decided to build her abbey where she could hear the Irish Sea soughing on the pebbly beach that now carries her name.</p> <p>St Bee's is notable today, though, as one of the few places in the north where we do turn our back on the coast and march determinedly inland. But why? Only because we're taking the coast-to-coast long-distance path, from one of the north's shining seas to the other.</p> <p><strong>Martin Wainwright</strong></p> <h2>The melting pot</h2> <p>I once spent an hour with my friend's grandmother in Crewe, outlining the vegetables I ate. Did I eat carrots? Yes. What about broccoli? Yes, loved it. And brussels sprouts? She was unashamedly curious about what this girl with the foreign name and brown skin would eat, and sweetly determined to cook something I'd be familiar with, despite my friend furiously pointing out I had lived in England all my life and had seen a cauliflower before.</p> <p>It wasn't exactly an isolated incident when I was growing up and working in the north - in Sheffield, people would open conversations with \"I had a lovely curry last night\", and in Newcastle triumphantly reveal that their daughter was travelling around India. </p> <p>But while it could be irritating, behind it was the honest refusal to pretend differences didn't exist.</p> <p>While London may think it has the monopoly on tolerance, the friendly half of the country has a proud history of diversity. </p> <p>In Liverpool, the Chinese community is the oldest in Europe, as is the city's 250-year-old black community.

  "<p>Credit Suisse has received a record \u00a35.6m fine from the Financial Services Authority after a scandal in which rogue traders in its investment banking division deliberately mispriced the asset-backed securities they held.</p> <p>In March the company said an internal investigation had found a small number of rogue traders had created pricing errors in their positions through \"intentional misconduct\". It said disciplinary action had been taken.</p> <p>A month earlier, when pricing inaccuracies first came to the attention of senior management, Credit Suisse was forced to announce a $2.65bn (\u00a31.39bn) write-down. The episode - which centred on controversial investment structures known as collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) - was highly damaging for already fragile investor sentiment in the banking sector.</p> <p>The meltdown in the US sub-prime mortgage market last year prompted a flight from credit risk that caught the banks off guard. The past 12 months have seen write-downs from financial institutions totalling $270bn, precipitated by this flight from risk and lingering scepticism about the thoroughness with which banks have written down the value of assets.</p> <p>The fine against Credit Suisse would have been as high as \u00a38m had it not been for prompt action and cooperation by the bank. It is the largest penalty for a breach of FSA principles by a regulated firm. Specifically, the fine relates to supervision failures by management and the lack of trader monitoring systems and controls.</p> <p>The FSA declined to say whether it was disciplining the rogue traders identified by Credit Suisse's internal investigation. In March the bank said: \"These employees have been terminated or have been suspended and are in the process of being disciplined under local employment law.\"</p> <p>Likely action from the FSA against the traders is expected to turn on a technical point - whether they were directly authorised to trade by the regulator or whether they traded under Credit Suisse's FSA authorisations, in which case they will not face action. It is understood the relevant Credit Suisse traders in London were trading under individual FSA authorisations, but a number overseas were not.</p> <p>\"The penalty reflects our tougher stance on enforcement and our policy of imposing higher penalties to achieve credible deterrence,\" said Margaret Cole, the FSA's director of enforcement.</p> <p>\"It is imperative, particularly in more challenging financial conditions, that firms have in place appropriate systems and controls to manage their risks. The [Credit Suisse] subsidiaries here failed to take appropriate steps to control the potentially high-risk combination in the structured credit group's holdings of exotic products, opaque valuations and high leverage. The sudden and unexpected announcement of the write-down had the potential to undermine market confidence.\"</p> <p>In a statement, Credit Suisse chief executive Brady Dougan said: \"This incident was unacceptable to me and the executive board. It does not represent the high ethical standards of Credit Suisse. ... we have taken actions to implement a remediation programme to address the findings of our internal review.\"</p> <p>The second largest fine for a similar breach was \u00a34m against Citigroup in 2005 relating to European bond trading. The only larger FSA fine was a \u00a317m market abuse penalty for Shell's misstating of proved reserves in 2004.</p>",

  "<p>The US and Europe yesterday demanded any settlement of the conflict in Georgia be based on recognition of the smaller country's territorial integrity. But after overrunning Georgia in five days, Russia rejected the terms.</p> <p>The EU unveiled a blueprint for ending the bloodshed after several days of French-led diplomacy between Moscow and Tbilisi which resulted in a six-point plan underpinning a fragile ceasefire.</p> <p>The US president George Bush warned the Kremlin that it had to \"keep its word and act to end this crisis\".</p> <p>But Russia declined to acknowledge Georgian sovereignty over all of its recognised territory, and refused to have any reference to it in the six-point plan.</p> <p>Russia agreed to \"international discussions\" with Georgia on South Ossetia and Abkhazia, but kept its options open on the two pro-Russian breakaway provinces.</p> <p>An EU statement said any peace settlement had to be based on Georgia's recognised territorial integrity. Bush said: \"The United States stands with the democratically elected government of Georgia. We insist the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia be respected.\"</p> <p>Sergei Ivanov, Russia's deputy prime minister, repeatedly refused to recognise Georgian control over its territory. \"We recognise the sovereignty of Georgia ... but territorial integrity, it's another matter,\" he told the BBC. \"South Ossetia and Abkhazia never were part of Georgia as an independent country.\"</p> <p>A US C-17 military aircraft carrying supplies and a contingent of military forces to carry out an aid mission arrived in Georgia last night, and a second flight was planned for today. Bush said the US expected Russia to allow humanitarian supplies into Georgia and ensure all lines of communication and transport stayed open. </p> <p>Analysts said the US was trying to use the flights to demonstrate strength to both Georgia, which has sought a stronger response from Washington, and Russia, while minimising the risk of being drawn into the conflict. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said the US had been careful to let Russia know about every flight, given the risks of the US and Russian militaries operating in such proximity. \"We do not want there to be any potential misunderstanding or miscalculation,\" he said. </p> <p>The 27 EU foreign ministers held an emergency session on the crisis yesterday. France's foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, admitted the deal he and President Nicolas Sarkozy mediated was \"partially unsatisfactory\", but said the priority was to obtain a durable ceasefire.</p> <p>The points agreed by Moscow and Tbilisi proscribe the use of force, pledge a ceasefire, and guarantee access for humanitarian aid. But the political and military aspects of the agreement are problematic and it could yet unravel.</p> <p>At Russian insistence, Georgian forces must return to base while Russian \"peacekeepers\" in South Ossetia are allowed to stage security patrols until an \"international mechanism\" is agreed.</p> <p>\"That gives the Russians undefined security rights in undefined territory in Georgia. That's an invitation to further problems,\" the Swedish foreign minister, Carl Bildt, told the Guardian.</p> <p>Prospective western reprisals against Moscow became clearer yesterday, with the US calling a special session of Nato foreign ministers which could suspend Russia's consultative link with the alliance. David Miliband, the foreign secretary, suggested Russia could be expelled from the G8 and that the EU may halt negotiations on a strategic pact.</p>",
  "<p>Russia's unjustified military action in Georgia, an EU and Nato aspirant state, provides the situation to judge whether the European Union has truly come of age and can punch its weight in the world. The suspension of EU-Russia negotiations on a new bilateral pact; freezing talks on visa-free travel for Russian citizens; and holding back EU humanitarian aid to Chechnya until Russia ends aggression in Georgia are three simple actions the EU can take. Once fighting dies down, the EU must also offer to send police to help keep the peace in Georgia's breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abhkazia and speed up free-trade and visa deals with Georgia and Ukraine, showing that those countries are not part of a grey zone for Russia to expand into.</p> <p>Russia's incursion into Georgia has thrown EU-Russia relations into turmoil in the gravest European security crisis since the 1999 Kosovo war. What is now required is for the EU to show that it has the strength and backbone to act and ensure that Russia does not get away with this naked aggression. In the early 1990s the EU let down the people of the Balkans as it stood by while the region tore itself apart, we cannot stand by and let this happen again.<br><strong>Alex Orr </strong><br>Edinburgh </p> <p>One of the arguments put by the Stop the War Coalition against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan was that they would lead to ever more wars and global instability in which ordinary people would pay the price. The crisis in Georgia vindicates this argument. \"Georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity should be respected,\" thunders George Bush, the commander-in-chief of an army occupying the sovereign territory of Iraq and Afghanistan and openly preparing to make war on Iran.</p> <p>The same western leaders who earlier this year recognised the independence of Kosovo from Serbia are in no position to criticise Russia's involvement in South Ossetia. The US and UK drove a coach and horses through international law and cynically manipulated the UN - invoking it when it seemed to support their position, ignoring it when it didn't - to make war on Iraq. They mapped out the bloody path that Russia is following today. Who else will go down it tomorrow?<br><strong>Sasha Simic </strong><br>London </p> <p>The South Ossetian conflict raises, yet again, the need for a set of international rules to protect minority populations within states that overrides national sovereignty when those minorities are being abused. Such rules were being discussed as a consequence of the greater Serbian project and ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, before they were spuriously used as one of the justifications for the war of aggression against Iraq. Even Russia must surely agree with this proposal now, given this accords with what it has said and done in South Ossetia. A political, diplomatic and legal template is far superior to rockets and war.<br><strong>Joe Murphy </strong><br>Manchester </p> <p>Simon Jenkins's suggestion that situations such as Zimbawbe or the Caucasus should be left to sort themselves out is a sad admission of defeat of liberal conscience (Comment, August 13). I agree President Bush is the last one entitled to lecture others on issues of intervention, and that realism in developing political relationships to prevent conflict is clearly needed. But the abuse of power under humanitarian pretext by the US and others does not make it less important for the world to take its responsibilities to protect people affected by widespread and systematic human rights abuses more seriously. Challenging outdated understandings of absolute state sovereignty, which reduce citizens to subjects of power politics, is essential in a world in which we share a common future.<br><strong>Michael Hammer </strong><br>Executive director, One World Trust </p> <p>\"What can have an impact on the Russians without damaging us more than them,\" asked one European official.

  "<p>The body that regulates solicitors has been discriminating against ethnic minority lawyers and subjecting them to potentially ruinous investigations, an independent report has concluded.</p> <p>The report, obtained by the Guardian, finds the Solicitors Regulation Authority pays \"lip service\" to equality, and is plagued by a leadership that lacks \"competence\" on diversity issues.</p> <p>It finds black and minority ethnic lawyers are \"stereotyped\" with SRA staff assuming guilt before they start investigating complaints against them. It says the organisation is open to the charge of being institutionally racist and was more likely to investigate ethnic minority lawyers than white ones. </p> <p>It says: \"The organisation has deficiencies which impact adversely on [ethnic minority] solicitors.\"</p> <p>The report was written by Lord Ouseley, the former head of the Commission for Racial Equailty. He headed an independent review, jointly commissioned by the SRA, into why black and Asian solicitors were more likely to be targeted by the organisation, which is the regulatory arm of the Law Society.</p> <p>It follows years of complaints from black and Asian solicitors that the SRA treats them unfairly.</p> <p>The report, to be released today, is highly critical of the organisation's leadership and says: \"The SRA at present lacks the drive and the equality and diversity competence within its managerial and leadership spheres to make the changes happen.\"</p> <p>It says the failings have \"potential discriminatory effects\" and says despite promises of reform, the SRA can be labelled as racist: \"Potentially this still leaves the SRA open to the charge of institutional racism, as its policies, procedures, practices and actions, however unintended, can be seen to have disproportionate detrimental and discriminatory outcomes for BME [black and minority ethnic] solicitors.\"</p> <p>It continues: \"Not to be under-estimated is the level of prejudice and bias which exists among personnel in this and other similar organisations.\"</p> <p>The report says this is the case with a minority of staff and adds some ethnic minority lawyers are judged to be guilty through racist stereotyping before an investigation is started.</p> <p>The SRA, which was created in 2006, handles complaints against solicitors and can investigate them for a variety of matters.</p> <p>Peter Herbert, chair of the Society of Black Lawyers and a member of the working party that produced the report, said: \"Black and minority solicitors faced racism.

  "<p>Cricket Australia's chief executive, James Sutherland, will next week arrive in Beijing, looking to \"sell\" the game to China. You suspect the Chinese have other things on their minds but you can understand Sutherland's motivation. Being a non-Olympic sport is like being the sickly child in a Hollywood weepie, the one who is not allowed out to play with the other kids and instead watches from an upstairs room, shortened breaths misting the window as sad strings play in the background.</p> <p>The Labour London Assembly member Murad Qureshi is also travelling to Beijing, in his case to campaign for cricket's inclusion as a demonstration sport in 2012, and the former Australia wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist has written in an Indian newspaper that the Olympics are the right \"vehicle\" to \"grow our game in new territories and amongst the women of the world\". Gilchrist also reminded readers that cricket made an Olympic appearance in 1900, when Britain beat France to the gold. He did not, however, say that they were the only two teams competing.</p> <p>As far as I can see, cricket already passes all the necessary requirements to be an Olympic sport, particularly when you consider its merits against, say, dressage or one of the martial arts. It is a predominantly middle-class game which is ignored by most of the world; it has pretty incomprehensible rules and officials making bizarre hand gestures; and it has players - in England's case, a captain - appearing on passports of convenience. What more does the International Olympic Committee want?</p> <p>There is, however, one more element that would help cricket's campaign: an indecipherable scoring system. With apologies to Messrs Duckworth and Lewis, who have already done their best, to win Jacques Rogge's heart cricket needs to introduce something truly subjective. How about a panel of judges giving scores for technique and artistic merit? A flukey edge to the boundary could get a 3.25; a crisp cover drive a rack of 5.8s. A flying catch at gully would be awarded a 6.0, but only if the fielder executed a perfect landing on both feet.</p> <p>With golf, squash, rugby, karate and softball all pushing for inclusion in 2016, the earliest cricket could hope to get a full members' spot would be 2020. This is rather nifty, since the version of the game cricket wants to bring to the party is, of course, Twenty20.</p> <p>Just think what fun we would have had if Twenty20 had been in Beijing. It could have slotted in very nicely in this first week, while the Bird's Nest Stadium has been sitting empty, its long jump pit boasting just the right dimensions for a drop-in pitch. Furthermore, the six-hitting (or 5.8-hitting) would have provided some unexpected interaction for the crowd, who presently get that kind of excitement only when a javelin throw goes seriously awry.</p> <p>Of course, in these heady days of million-dollar prize funds it takes a lot to lure English cricketers to any tournament. But a gold medal would appeal to Kevin Pietersen's love of bling, for one, and the Olympic Village would have benefited hugely from the England team's presence. It has, after all, been worrying to hear how sparingly our gold medallists, Nicole Cooke and Rebecca Adlington, have been celebrating. Send in Andrew Flintoff and Steve Harmison and the entire British camp could enjoy a 24-hour bender starting with an illicit raid on the fireworks stash and finishing with a late-night splashabout at the Water Cube.</p> <p>OK, we would have lost to the Aussies or, more likely, the Chinese. But at least we would have had live cricket back on the BBC (I suspect, with their reverence for age and aphorisms, that the Chinese would love Richie Benaud). And just think what Twenty20's innovations could have done for the Olympic coverage. Take the onfield earpieces worn by fielders in order for them to banter with commentators between overs. Setting aside flirting opportunities between Sue Barker and Shane Warne, the potential across other events is endless: think of BMXers nagged to do wheelies or sailors forced to sing their favourite shanties. Blake Aldridge would never have been able to make that fateful phone call to his mum if he had been stuck telling Hazel Irvine about Tom Daley's nerves.</p> <p>I will not even embark on the joys of umpires having to call the players off for \"bad smog\" or boundary music being provided by a lip-synching band bearing an Asiatic resemblance to Atomic Kitten, the original Kittens having been hidden behind a screen, on account of their noses not being quite straight enough.</p> <p>Twenty20 for 2020? It's a shoo-in.</p>",
  "<p>Thaksin Shinawatra has indicated he will stay away from Manchester City's Uefa Cup qualifying tie against the Danish side FC Midtjylland tonight as he contemplates the first stages of a legal battle to avoid extradition back to Thailand.</p> <p>Five days after jumping bail and fleeing to London rather than risk being sent to prison on corruption charges, Thaksin is aware his presence at the City of Manchester stadium could be unwelcome for Mark Hughes in what the manager, with a hefty amount of understatement, described yesterday as a \"difficult week\".</p> <p>Hughes spoke of supporters being \"upset and bewildered\" because of the flood of negative publicity, although he reiterated that he would not resign despite his own problems adapting to the new regime. City, he insisted, were \"going in the right direction\" and, to back up his point, he revealed that Thaksin was still wealthy enough for transfer money to be available. \"I've been reassured,\" he said. \"People may have been concerned that I wouldn't have the funds to bring in players but that's not the case. We are actively pursuing players as we speak.\"</p> <p>It is clear, however, that City are not in the financial position that Hughes assumed when he left Blackburn Rovers to take the job 10 weeks ago. Thaksin is unable to free the \u00a3800m worth of assets that are frozen in Thailand and Hughes had to intervene to prevent Vedran Corluka being sold to Tottenham Hotspur earlier this week, as well as having to investigate whether Stephen Ireland had also been put up for sale.</p> <p>\"It has been a difficult week in many respects but it has happened very early in my tenure and from this point onwards we can move on and work much better,\" said Hughes. \"There have been misunderstandings but it's also true to say that in any organisation, if you make big changes, on occasions messages will be misinterpreted and mistakes will be made.\"</p> <p>The former Wales manager, whose problems have been exacerbated by the news that Darius Vassell will miss 10 weeks with a knee injury, described himself as \"stimulated\" by the new challenges but there was also a telling admission that he was still waiting for his first face-to-face meeting with Thaksin. He did confirm, however, that he had been promised nobody would be sold against his wishes.</p> <p>\"I had a meeting with the players to make the group aware that I'm in charge and will make the decisions that affect the players,\" he added. \"If players leave or if they go, that decision will be mine and mine solely. That's where we are and I think everybody understands now that that is the situation. I think we will be better for it and we can now move forward.\"</p> <p>The truth, however, is that City will face an uncertain future for as long as Thaksin is living in exile, with Thailand already making preparations to try to extradite him. A team of government lawyers has been assembled to examine his case, according to the state prosecutor.</p> <p>Meanwhile the Supreme Court in Thailand is expected to pass judgment on a land deal involving Thaksin on September 16. A conviction in his absence could affect his ownership of Manchester City under the FA's \"fit and proper person\" rule. However, he is accused of contravening Thai rules over purchases of state land while in office, an offence that does not exist under British law.</p> <p>\"We can't really go into the details of the owner's position because, if we are truthful, we don't know which way it is going to go,\" said Hughes. \"But I was aware of this situation before I came here.\"</p>",
  "<p>A few weeks ago I was listening to a news report about Boots's treatment of a 12-year-old schoolgirl whom they had detained for trying out a dab of nail polish from a bottle that wasn't a tester. The minute the polish touched Hannah Gilbert's nail she was stopped by a security guard, told she had committed a crime, and marched into an office. Three policemen were called to the scene. The policemen checked to see whether she had a criminal record. Boots then summoned Hannah's parents, who were told that unless they paid the full (\u00a36.29) cost of the nail polish, Hannah would be charged with theft. After more than an hour of detention, the shocked child was released. </p> <p>What I wanted to know was how Boots would apologise for this ludicrous, heavy-handed overreaction by junior staff. Why had they called the police when a tap on the shoulder and a 30-second lecture on the difference between testers and pristine bottles would have been enough? Why indeed had a permanently overstretched police force decided that this was one of its priorities? How would a company that needs to keep the custom of teenage girls in these credit-crunchy times redeem itself? </p> <p>Boots's head office was quite clear. There was no apology. Their statement was prim and self-congratulatory: \"Our staff were following set procedures.\" </p> <p>This isn't a defence, but a monstrous smoke screen. It's an increasingly common and chilling variation of the old defence of the indefensible, \"I'm just doing my job\". Too many organisations seem to imagine that sticking to procedures is in itself a virtue. That's not how it feels to those of us at the receiving end of this inflexible, wooden approach. Too often it feels as if we're being corralled into a cage made by madmen, pleading for some kind of intelligence or humanity from the person in front of us or on the end of the phone. </p> <p>Earlier this summer my father, who is in his late 70s and disabled, had a stroke. It happened on a Friday, and my distraught mother rang in the late afternoon to say that he had collapsed, and could neither walk nor speak. She was calling the neighbours around their remote hillside in rural Wales to see whether they could help her lift him up. Forty-five minutes later I called her back but there was no reply. Fifteen minutes later: \"This number is not recognised.\"</p> <p>In a panic, I rang BT. The first person I spoke to was in an Indian call centre. Could he check the line please; this was an emergency. He asked me for the account number. What account number? The telephone number? No, he needed to know the account number before he was permitted to check the line. How would I find it? By asking the account holder. \"But that's why I'm ringing you! I can't speak to the account holder because something's gone wrong with your line!\" Then he couldn't help me. Well, could he transfer me to customer services, or the engineers? </p> <p>Number, name, postcode, account number. Desperate, I explained the situation to person number two. This one was in England. She told me there was no record of my parents' line. And that, as far as she was concerned, was that. Please, I said, look again. This line existed until an hour ago. Meanwhile my father might be dying on a Welsh hillside. Complete indifference from person number two. I plead to be transferred to someone else. </p> <p>I explain everything again to person number three. She finds the line and confirms that it has been cut off that afternoon. I know this isn't about bills, this is some madness. Can it be reconnected as a matter of emergency? She's not interested in my emergency. Nothing can be done until BT can determine why it has been cut off. I am transferred to person number four. </p> <p>It is now an hour into the call. Number, name, postcode, account number. It turns out BT has been confused over the validity of the line, whatever that means. It is their mistake. They do not care. The engineers have gone home and I cannot talk directly to them anyway. I will have to go on a list for reconnection which could be a fortnight. Tearful, I ask if the wait can be shortened for cases like this. The answer is no. Person number four is as bored by me as the rest have been. Not one has said they're sorry - either for the situation, or for BT's mistake. Can I speak to a manager? No, they've left. No, there's no one else who can help. If I want to make an appointment for reconnection, I will have to speak to person number five. </p> <p>Person number five offers me a date. It is a month away. Incredulous, with knots of fear in my stomach, I explain it all again. No reaction. This is the system, she says. Do I want to make the appointment or not? Because if I don't wish to accept it, she will terminate the call. As an afterthought, and because it's clearly on the script, she asks: \"And is there anything else I can help you with today?\"</p> <p>I put down the phone and burst into tears. It has been an 80-minute call, and I have either been listening to machines, or conversing with automatons throughout. The indifference of the system feels brutal, and I can't break through it. It is now seven o'clock. As a last resort, I ring directory inquiries and ask them to put me through not to the faults line, but to BT's head office. </p> <p>A real person answers the phone. She is a middle-aged Welsh woman with a comfortable voice, and when I tell her why I'm ringing, the first thing she says is: \"Oh dear! That sounds terrible!\" She is the chairman's secretary, and she isn't following any script. She says immediately that she has a list of managers and she will start ringing them now until she finds one who will deal with it and call me back. And she does. The phone is reconnected within 40 hours, and many apologies sent to my father as he recovers. </p> <p>We have all had miserable experiences like these, often as companies try to increase efficiency by giving workers templates to work from, and by outsourcing work to call centres here and abroad. It's better for them if every client can be fitted into the pattern which makes their work simplest. Yet this attitude also runs the risk of damaging what is supposed to be their core purpose: keeping customers satisfied. </p> <p>Cary Cooper, professor of management at Lancaster University, says that too many companies imagine that, in rule-bound workplaces, employees will still recognise that solving customers' problems must come first. In practice the majority of employees are too frightened of getting things wrong to make that effort, he says. Give them a procedure and they'll follow it blindly. And that's the real test. BT may have apologised where Boots was unrepentant, but nothing in BT's procedures or attitudes will stop the same thing happening to someone else tomorrow. </p> <p>Working to rules, with no opportunity to use your initiative, must be as depressing for employees as it is for us on the receiving end. Companies must be calculating that the frustration on both sides matters less than cutting costs. Maybe they're right. If we disagree, it's up to us to demonstrate it - where we can - by using consumer power to reward the ones that do respond on a human level. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jenni.russell@theguardian.com\">jenni.russell@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Simone Mirman, who has died aged 96, was milliner to the last generation of Englishwomen - including the Queen - who were in the habit of wearing hats. \"I only make hats,\" Mirman wrote in reproof to a newspaper that once fantasised about upperclass London life. But in truth she did more than that; she offered women reassurance about their appearance. Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown, but not the regal head that wore a Mirman hat.</p> <p>Born Simone Parmentier in Paris, where her father worked for a pharmaceuticals company, Mirman served her apprenticeship with the great Parisian milliner Rose Valois at a time when there were almost as many hat shops as cafes in the French capital. But she only considered herself trained when she had created her first masterpiece - a hat exactly suited to her mother's difficult face. </p> <p>She then joined the atelier of the couturiere Elsa Schiaparelli, who understood that many women, neither rich nor bold enough to dress in her shocking styles, were willing to buy her radical accessories. Schiaparelli hats could be mixed media collages or soft, surreal sculptures or both. That didn't faze Simone. She could make anything - and make anything flatter its wearer.</p> <p>Her suitor, Serge Mirman, a communist Jewish medical student with Russian connections, whom she had met in her early 20s, was not acceptable to her middle-class, Catholic parents, so the couple eloped to London in 1937. Neither spoke English. There, Simone headed the hat department of Schiaparelli's shop in Upper Grosvenor Street, Mayfair, until the outbreak of the second world war, when Schiaparelli closed down, but bequeathed her list of customers to Simone.</p> <p>Serge and Simone married in penury in 1939. They lived in a Paddington attic - a garret, plus bathroom, with furnishings made by Serge; every day they hid all traces of their real life and turned the flat into a salon for the many customers who would go anywhere in pursuit of off-ration glamour. Simone kept very busy through the war because clothing coupons were not needed for hats; they were the only permissible frivolity in restricted wardrobes, and she confected her tiny, jaunty flourishes out of any scraps that could be scrounged, recycled or improvised.</p> <p>In 1947, her customers followed her to better premises near Hyde Park; she moved to Chesham Place, Belgravia, in 1952, and ran a salon and workroom there for almost 30 years. The Mirmans re-established those old connections with Paris, and with its new fashion wonder, Christian Dior; Simone made hats for him, while Serge saw the financial potential in Dior's idea to license the sale of his branded accessories, especially nylon stockings. Simone also worked for Norman Hartnell, couturier by appointment to the royal family. They bought hats from London's premier milliner, Aage Thaarup, but in 1952, after Princess Margaret reportedly thought his prices too high, Simone was invited to show her wares at Buckingham Palace. </p> <p>The royals began to patronise Simone, and the Queen and the Queen Mother later granted her their warrants. All three women wanted different personal styles. The Queen Mother harked back to the aureolate hats of her youth, wide-brimmed and cargoed with frail flowers and feathers; Princess Margaret wore whatever was most modish. Once Princess Elizabeth had been crowned Queen, she chose her headgear to please the camera - brims, if any, turned back to reveal her face, crowns all-encompassing to hold her set hair safe beneath, clear colours to match Hartnell's ensembles, and unusual materials to stress her non-mundane presence.</p> <p>An exhibition of the Queen's hats and handbags at Kensington Palace in 2003 made their protective role explicit - handbags with handles held in the crook of the arm like a shield, hats securing an enlarged personal space for the face. (Simone said hats always gave women confidence.)</p> <p>Simone's best in the show were cloches dense with small flowerheads, as though the Queen were wearing the posies with which she is always presented. The most remembered, though, was a modification of an early Tudor headdress for the investiture of the Prince of Wales in 1969, so dramatic you expected to hear her shout \"Off with his head!\". </p> <p>Simone stayed fashionable into the 1970s, making fun versions of the mid-1960s brimless helmets appliqu\u00e9d in plastic \"jewels\", and a cap with a PVC visor like a welder's mask - hardly new to Simone, for cellophane had been an essential Schiaparelli substance. When Hartnell designed uniforms for Metropolitan policewomen in 1967, Simone did the caps. But she was also interested in a precise match of woman and hat, and worked circling round each customer to check all the angles until both were certain. The whackier Mirman hats, meant for press attention, were likely to be the work of Serge. As the hat business dwindled, newer names favoured uncompromising chapeaux which wearers were required to suit; when model hats were revived in the 1980s, they were meant wholly for the camera and overshadowed their wearers. Simone's equal partnership between hat and personality had been dissolved.</p> <p>She had by then left Chesham Place and had a business with her daughter, Sophie, selling leather accessories and simple hats. She retired to France in 1990, where she painted until her eyesight failed. Serge died in 1980. Sophie, who founded the Sock Shop chain and the children's shop Trotters, survives her. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Simone Mirman, milliner, born April 18 1912; died August 1 2008</p>",
  "<p>The traditional picture of the British family spending its evenings slumped in front of the TV has changed dramatically, according to a new report from the watchdog Ofcom, published today. The box is still on, but the people on the sofa are talking on the phone, texting furiously or surfing the internet - increasingly using a laptop with a mobile broadband connection - while they keep one eye on the screen.</p> <p>Despite doomsayers who believe the web will eventually kill off TV, viewing has not yet collapsed. The average Briton spent 218 minutes - or over three and a half hours - a day watching television last year, two minutes more than in 2006 but down on 224 minutes in 2002. In comparison, the average internet user spent 24 minutes a day online when at home last year, up from just six minutes in 2002.</p> <p>But what has changed is that the TV no longer has the viewer's undivided attention, according to Ofcom's annual Communications Market report. Three quarters of 20- to 34-year-olds regularly use their mobile when in front of the TV, while more than a third of 25- to 44-year-olds often check the internet at the same time as watching a programme.</p> <p>Television is finding itself increasingly usurped among the young. While TV remains the \"media activity\" that British people above the age of 20 say they would miss most, 16- to 19-year-olds say it is a mobile phone they couldn't live without. </p> <p>The report shows the UK's continuing love affair with the mobile. More people send a text every day than access the internet and there are more phones in circulation than there are people in the UK. Nearly 60 billion text messages were sent last year - up 36% on 2006 - and mobile phone users talk on their phone for an average of 10 minutes a day, double the usage recorded in 2002.</p> <p>The mobile phone and other distractions mean young people are watching fewer TV shows, with 16- to 24-year-olds glued to the set for about 150 minutes a day in 2007, 10 minutes less than five years ago and more than an hour less than the UK average. People over 65, in contrast, spend five hours a day watching TV.</p> <p>Instead, younger people are spending more of their time online but with download and streaming services such as the BBC's iPlayer reporting record demand, many are merely choosing to watch their favourite TV programmes when they want by getting content from the web. Nearly a third of all internet users watched video clips and webcasts last year with the number of UK users of YouTube hitting 9 million this April alone - up 50% on a year before.</p> <p>Throwing off the shackles of the TV schedulers is not just the ambition of people with an internet connection. Almost a quarter of UK households - 6 million - had a digital video recorder by the end of last year, up 53% on 2006. DVRs allow people to store their favourite shows for viewing later. Their success is bad news for advertisers who use commercial television to get in front of a mass audience. Of those with a digital recorder, 88% always skip past the ads, according to Ofcom.</p> <p>But when they do watch \"traditional\" television, the taste of 16- to 24-year-olds is remarkably similar to that of those over 65. Both like entertainment and contemporary music shows while 16- to 24-year- olds watch slightly more soap operas and factual programmes than people over 65. The big difference between the age groups, according to the report, is in the area of news and weather programming.</p> <p>Among those over 65, TV news and weather programmes account for 14% of all viewing, compared to just 7% of all viewing by 16- to 24-year-olds.</p> <p>The Ofcom report shows that online advertising hit \u00a32.8bn last year, up 40%, and eclipsing spending on the traditional terrestrial channels ITV1, Channel 4, S4C and Five for the first time. Given how much more time people spend watching TV than using the internet the figures look incongruous, but the Ofcom report does not take into account the amount of time British consumers spend online at work.</p> <p>In fact, take-up of residential internet services is slowing as the digital divide between rich and poor becomes ever more obvious. Most households that have a computer are already online with PC penetration running at 72% in the UK and internet penetration close behind at 67%. Broadband take-up - at 58% of UK households - has slowed not least because younger consumers such as students are opting to buy mobile phone \"dongles\" that give internet access and are often cheaper than a lengthy broadband contract. Over 2 million Britons now use mobile internet services, with sales of dongles nearly doubling between February and June this year to over 130,000 a month.</p> <h2>Why we should turn off our electrical appliances</h2> <p>British households are wasting the annual output of a large power station by failing to switch off their flatscreen televisions, set-top boxes, and internet networks when they are not being used, according to Ofcom's latest Communications Market report.</p> <p>The equivalent output of the 1,500MW Didcot B power station in Oxfordshire could be saved each year if every home with a set-top box switched it off at night; that would conserve enough electricity to make 80bn cups of tea.</p> <p>Consumer electronics account for about a third of home energy use, according to the Energy Saving Trust, but that use is forecast to balloon to 45% by 2020 as more people buy more gadgets.</p> <p>The rise in average residential energy bills to just over \u00a31,000 a year has made people more energy aware, but only when it comes to buying obviously power-hungry devices such as fridges and freezers, according to Ofcom.</p> <p>Almost three quarters of Britons, when quizzed by the regulator, classed themselves as caring about the environment, and more than half said they had compared the green credentials of white goods before making a purchase. But only 39% of people think about the environmental impact of a new TV, DVD player or computer. </p> <p>When they get it home, meanwhile, most people leave their new kit switched on all the time, unnecessarily wasting electricity. </p> <p>Three quarters of people rarely switch off their set-top box, according to Ofcom, and that figure jumps to 83% for owners of a wireless home network. Plasma screens are particularly power hungry, according to the regulator, with the average set using three times the power of a normal TV when in use, and twice the power when left on standby. </p> <p>The average satellite set-top box gobbles up four and a half times the power of a flatscreen LCD television in the same state. Even a Freeview box uses twice the power of a flatscreen TV when left on standby.</p> <p>Almost half the country's mobile phone users, meanwhile, waste electricity by charging their handsets overnight, when in fact most models only need to be plugged in for about two hours. People aged between 16 to 24 are particularly guilty of this, with 80% doing it at least some of the time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336574942\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2008/08/13/14.08.08.Ofcom.gif\" alt=\"Ofcom charts\" width=\"462\" height=\"802\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Saturday August 23 2008.

  "<h2>Halls of residence, Clough Hall, Edge Hill University</h2> <p><strong>Leanne Watson, 23 </strong><br><strong>BA (Hons) Dance</strong><br><strong>Home town: Hull</strong></p> <p>I've had a brilliant year in halls, but I'm looking forward to having more privacy when I move into a shared house next term. I worked for five years before coming to university. When you've been working and living in your own place it can be hard to adjust to communal living. There are 24 of us on the corridor, and we get along brilliantly, but there are always going to be niggles. </p> <p>The bathrooms aren't very clean. That's boys for you! There are five showers, but only one power shower, which everyone squabbles over. The boys' toilet isn't very nice. There is wee all round it. Some people take ages in the bath, Pete for one. I've no idea what he's doing in there ...</p> <p>The kitchen is OK, but some people leave their washing-up for days. I don't mind people using my stuff as long as they wash it afterwards. There's often mouldy food in the fridge. I'm as guilty as anyone - I've had a cheese and coleslaw salad in there for two weeks now. It's grown skin and hair and everything. </p> <p>Sometimes the boys will come in after a night out and be quite loud, which can be a bit annoying if you've got a 9am lecture the next day. A few months ago, they put a dartboard up at the end of the corridor. They'll come back at 1am and start a darts competition. You ask them to be quiet and they're fine about it, but then they start again. There's no bad feeling, though. It's all good-humoured. </p> <p><strong>John Kelly, 25</strong><br><strong>(Bsc) Sports and exercise science</strong><br><strong>Home town: Liverpool</strong></p> <p>This is my third year in halls. I tried a shared house in my second year, but it wasn't sociable enough for me. I now get paid around \u00a3200 a month for being a student adviser. Officially, I'm supposed to work seven hours a week, but it usually ends up being more.</p> <p>I like to think of myself as a big brother figure. I get woken up by people who've forgotten their keys or had a bit too much to drink and want to talk. We sometimes have trouble with people from other halls - or sometimes not from the university at all - trying to get in at night, so I have to deal with that.</p> <p>People come to me about everything, from their money worries to boyfriend and girlfriend troubles. The first term is particularly busy. I try to organise loads of social events to help people settle in, but people do get homesick. </p> <p>The halls have been updated since I started university. It used to feel like a hospital: lino floors and bare white walls. Now there are carpets in every room it's far more welcoming. The plumbing is still old though, so the showers aren't the best. The bathrooms aren't exactly filthy, but some people are inconsiderate. The girls are the worst actually. They leave hair in the plughole.</p> <p>We've got lockers in the kitchen, but there are still squabbles over food. I've drawn a line on my milk carton before so I can tell if people have nicked any from the fridge. Some people even scrawl swear words on their milk cartons, but people still help themselves.</p> <p>It's great not having to worry about cooking, but some of the food could be improved. But the staff are friendly and the lasagne takes some beating. </p> <p><strong>Pete Moss, 22</strong><br><strong>BA (Hons) Coach education and participation development </strong><br><strong>Home town: Lincoln</strong></p> <p>Freshers' week was brilliant. It was just one big party. We went and bought a load of buckets from Morrisons and filled them up with homemade punch. We did think about using the bath, but that would be a bit unhygienic, wouldn't it? I'm fairly easygoing, so there isn't much that gets to me. The toilets and bathrooms are nice and clean. What does annoy me is when people leave water on the bathroom floor. You walk in your socks and they get all wet. </p> <p>I've never really noticed anyone being particularly noisy, but that's probably because I'm one of the ones being lairy! </p> <p>Living in halls is such a good laugh. I'm moving into a shared house next year, but I don't really want to. There are only going to be five of us, which isn't going to be as much fun. Here, there's always someone around to talk to, any time of day or night. </p> <p><strong>Matt O'Neill, 19</strong><br><strong>BA (Hons) History</strong><br><strong>Home town: Sunderland </strong></p> <p>I've only been at Edge Hill for just over a term. I transferred from York St John. </p> <p>The halls are really sociable here. It's reasonably clean, but with 24 people on this corridor, there's bound to be more mess. Wednesday and Sundays are the big nights out, so there can be a bit of a queue for the shower. People do bicker about it, but it's generally good-humoured. </p> <p>It can be a bit noisy at night, which can be a bit annoying. But I knew it would be like that in halls, so it doesn't bother me too much. </p> <p>Next year I'm going into a shared house with four other lads, including my brother. I'm really looking forward to that. It will be really nice to have a room where you can sit and watch telly instead of sitting in each other's room. </p> <h2>Shared house, Lincoln University</h2> <p><strong>Lauren Slater, 20</strong><br><strong>BA (Hons) Drama</strong><br><strong>Home town: Leamington Spa</strong></p> <p>The house is Victorian and terraced. It's very long, with very little light, so it can feel quite gloomy. I thought my room was grim at first, but I've grown to love it. It's quite small, with this awful woodchip wallpaper and has a nasty grey carpet which runs through the house. </p> <p>With six of us using it, the kitchen can get pretty disgusting. I chucked out a bowl of tuna mayonnaise from the fridge today. It was completely green. A couple of weeks ago I was in the shower when the water started rising up around my ankles. The plughole was clogged with blond hair. I was almost retching. </p> <p>Sadie uses her floor as a wardrobe. Lucy is the one who has her essays done well before the deadline and sorts out all the paperwork for the house, but her room is a tip. We call her bed \"The Bin\". You never know what might be lurking. I once found a fork in a plastic bag in there. Another time, I sat on a drawing pin. </p> <p>Meg tried to deny she was a chav for the first few months, but now she just admits it. She does the chav look: Fred Perry tops, trackie bottoms, massive gold earrings and permanent fake tan. And she's always got 50 Cent or Justin Timberlake blasting out of her room. </p> <p>Sadie's music is worse. She listens to Al Green, Abba and Phil Collins. We call her the crooner. She sings along to everything, knows the words to absolutely every song you could possibly think of. It's a good job she's got a nice singing voice, otherwise we'd have killed her by now. </p> <p>I guess the others probably think I'm dramatic. I often get texts from the others late at night asking me to \"shut up and go to bed\".</p> <p><strong>Lucy Tant, 21</strong><br><strong>BA (Hons) Journalism</strong><br><strong>Home town: Exmouth</strong></p> <p>After living in halls last year, I couldn't wait to move into a house. My room had breeze block walls, like a prison cell.</p> <p>There are six of us in the house and we pay \u00a3263 a month. The four of us have a right laugh together. We don't see much of our other two housemates. One is really nice, but spends a lot of time in Nottingham, where her boyfriend is studying. We had a big bust up with the other one. We've barely spoken since Christmas.</p> <p>My room isn't much better than last year's. It's quite big, but has this mint-green stucco wallpaper. It backs on to the downstairs bathroom. Sometimes I come in and it smells of cat pee. I bought a plug-in air freshener but it hasn't made much difference. </p> <p>We don't really argue, but when you're sharing a place, there are obviously going to be things you find irritating. The tumble dryer is incredibly noisy and is right outside my door. People do have a habit of using it in the middle of the night. </p> <p><strong>Meg Lindow, 20</strong><br><strong>BA (Hons) Media production</strong><br><strong>Home town: Hull</strong></p> <p>I got last pick, but I think I've got one of the best rooms. I've got a big bedroom on the ground floor. I'm not keen on the lilac walls, though. We've got two bathrooms between the six of us, but we all miss the ensuite bathrooms we had in halls.</p> <p>I really liked the kitchen-cum-living room when we came to look round the house. Now I wish they were separate. There's always someone bashing around in the kitchen when you're watching telly. </p> <p>We bicker, but we're tight as a group. I can't think of three girls I'd rather live with. We've all got part-time jobs, so we get plenty of space from one another. We don't see much of the other two. </p> <p>Lucy is the organised one. She found us the house and takes on the mother role, but her room is a tip. Lauren is the little one with the big mouth. </p> <p>Sadie spends a ridiculous amount of time in the bathroom and plays terrible music. She's just bought some new speakers and I keep getting woken up in the morning by Phil Collins. She blames it on her iTunes shuffle. I mean, what kind of 20-year-old girl listens to Phil Collins? The others all call me a chav because I like dance music. </p> <p>When you live with friends, you have to be open about things like sex. The walls are pretty thin. We've all heard things we'd rather not hear. It's big joke between us now. </p> <p>The four of us have got a house for next year. We're all looking forward to that. </p> <p><strong>Sadie Geoghegan, 21</strong><br><strong>BA (Hons) Journalism</strong><br><strong>Home town: Market Harborough</strong></p> <p>I couldn't wait to get out of halls last year. There were stains on the carpets. The firedoor had graffiti all over it. Worst of all, I moved in and found a bird's nest on top of the wardrobe and bird poo all over the walls. </p> <p>The first thing we did when we moved in was buy some throws for the sofas. The cushions are quite tatty, too. The landlord keeps asking us to sew them up! We use them as dinner trays. I'm not sure how much the rent is. My parents pay it. A few times we've had to phone up the landlord because the internet or telly has stopped working. </p> <p>The four of us get on pretty well. We shop and cook together. We split the cost four ways, but we're all allowed one luxury item that no one is allowed to touch. The deal is that whoever hasn't cooked washes up, but it doesn't always happen. Sometimes the washing up is touching the ceiling. </p> <p>With six of us living here, we do generate a lot of rubbish. You're not allowed to overfill wheelie bins around here. The bin collection is on Friday, so we often creep out late on Thursday night and empty our rubbish into our neighbours' bins. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>For more on accommodation, go to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/studenthousing\">theguardian.com/education/studenthousing</a></p> <h2>Housing tips</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Most universities offer first-year students accommodation in a hall of residence on or near the campus.

  "<p>Maria Eugenia Sampallo Barragan was born 30 years ago in a torture centre, after her parents were abducted by the Argentinian security forces. They were among the thousands of dissidents who were made to disappear in the junta's \"dirty war\". Human rights groups believe more than 200 of their children were given to families with connections to the military or the political elite.</p> <p>Maria is now suing her adoptive parents for hiding the truth about her background. Daniel Schweimler tells the story in <strong>Assignment</strong> (10.05am and repeated, World Service).</p> <p>Over at the <strong>Proms</strong> (7pm, Radio 3), Daniel Barenboim is conducting a living, breathing symbol of reconciliation, the West-Eastern Divan orchestra. \"The 'exotic' element ... of an orchestra of Israelis and Arabs performing European music has lessened,\" says Barenboim. \"The orchestra is now judged purely on musical terms.\" Anyway, they will be performing Haydn's Sinfonia Concertante for oboe, bassoon, violin and cello, Schoenberg's Variations for Orchestra and Brahms's poignant Fourth Symphony.</p>",
  "<p>Better than nothing. That is the absolute cheeriest thing that can be said about the Bank of England's growth forecasts yesterday. A statistical cigarette paper is all that now separates the economy from outright contraction over the coming year. The central projection was for national income to grow by a fraction of 1%, and in turbulent times such numbers oscillate wildly. Although bank governor Mervyn King was characteristically calm in giving his grim forebodings, he did not disguise the reality that there is now a strong possibility of recession. With new unemployment figures, also out yesterday, suggesting the tally was rising more rapidly than for years, the well-worn talk about a slowdown is giving way to the realisation that the economy has juddered to a halt.</p> <p>In simpler times the Bank would be reaching for its financial jump-leads - cutting interest rates in the hope of persuading firms and homebuyers to spend more. The times, however, are complicated by resurgent inflation. Just a day before Mr King gave his verdict, official figures had confirmed what shoppers already knew, that price rises are gathering pace. At more than double the Bank's 2% target, Tuesday's figure of 4.4% was quite bad enough. Mr King, however, signalled yesterday that big heating bill increases already in the gas pipeline would soon push it the wrong side of 5%. Next month the governor will be picking up his pen to explain himself in an open letter to the chancellor, as he is obliged to do on a quarterly basis whenever living costs rise by more than 3%. Never an easy letter to write, if the bank was seen to be emphasising expansionary action over price stability, it could become plain awkward.</p> <p>Awkward but appropriate. The Bank is not charged with targeting inflation next month, but inflation in two years' time. The slowdown will reduce it by then, as will the recent fall in global commodity prices - it may not have registered on the forecourts yet, but the price of a barrel of crude is down $30 from its July peak. So, the Bank's best guess is that by summer 2010 inflation will be more or less on target. What holds it back from rate cuts is fear the inflationary contagion will spread from the shops to pay packets, and then run out of control. </p> <p>When central bankers wake in a cold sweat at night, they imagine some spectral unionist cackling \"I'm alright Jack\" after winning an unaffordable rise. One unionist, Paul Kenny of the GMB, popped up this week to stoke the nightmare by saying that higher wages had become \"inevitable\". But the reincarnation of Red Robbo looks decidedly unlikely in the light of yesterday's earnings data. While inflation has waxed, pay rises have waned - the average increase in the year to June being just 3.4%. In public, private, manufacturing and service sectors the downward trend was the same. The Treasury, it seems, is having some success in bearing down on the public wage bill. And in the private sector, four workers in five do not have a union to argue for inflation-busting rises.</p> <p>If wages remain sluggish, the case for a rate cut will soon become unanswerable. The Bank remains nervous, but at least has the prospect that its dilemma will thus ease. No such luck for ministers, who will find no comfort at all in Mr King's suggestion that the \"squeeze on real take-home pay\" will soon intensify. For Gordon Brown, in particular, the worry is voters will now turn even more violently on the man who once led them to believe that he had abolished boom and bust. He must show struggling families that he is on their side, but his options are limited as the slowdown is hitting the government's already-battered books. The scant funds available must be channelled into assistance with heating, and targeted help with mortgages for those in danger of repossession. It will not be easy to afford such a package. But what the government can afford even less is to stand idly by and leave vulnerable people to struggle alone as the big squeeze takes hold.</p>",

  "<p>Rapid advances in neuroscience could have a dramatic impact on national security and the way in which wars are fought, intelligence officials have been told.</p> <p>In a report commissioned by the US Defence Intelligence Agency, leading scientists were asked to examine how a greater understanding of the brain over the next 20 years was likely to drive the development of new medicines and technologies. </p> <p>They found several areas in which progress could have a profound impact, including behaviour-altering drugs, scanners that can interpret a person's state of mind and devices capable of boosting senses such as hearing and vision.</p> <p>On the battlefield bullets may be replaced with \"pharmacological land mines\" that release drugs to incapacitate soldiers on contact, while scanners and other electronic devices could be developed to identify suspects from their brain activity and even disrupt their ability to tell lies when questioned, the report says.</p> <p>\"The concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market. It is possible that some day there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects,\" the report states.</p> <p>The report highlights one electronic technique, called transcranial direct current stimulation, which involves using electrical pulses to interfere with the firing of neurons in the brain, which has been shown to delay a person's ability to tell a lie.</p> <p>Drugs could also be used to enhance the performance of military personnel. There is already anecdotal evidence of troops using the narcolepsy drug modafinil, and ritalin, which is prescribed for attention deficit disorder, to boost their performance. </p> <p>Future drugs, developed to boost the cognitive faculties of people with dementia, are likely to be used in a similar way, the report adds. </p> <p>Greater understanding of the brain's workings is also expected to usher in new devices that link directly to the brain, either to allow operators to control machinery with their minds, such as flying unmanned reconnaissance drones, or to boost their natural senses. </p> <p>The report warns that while the US and other western nations might now consider themselves at the forefront of neuroscience, that is likely to change as other countries ramp up their computing capabilities. Unless security services can monitor progress internationally, they risk \"major, even catastrophic, intelligence failures in the years ahead\", the report warns. </p> <p>The development of advanced surveillance techniques, such as cameras that can spot fearful expressions on people's faces, could lead to some inventive ways to fool them, the report adds, such as Botox injections to relax facial muscles. </p> <p>\"In the intelligence community there is an extremely small number of people who understand the science and without that it's going to be impossible to predict surprises. This is a black hole that needs to be filled with light,\" said Kit Green, who chaired the report committee.</p> <p>The technologies will one day have applications in counter-terrorism and crime-fighting. The report says brain imaging will not improve sufficiently in the next 20 years to read people's intentions from afar and spot criminals before they act, but it might be good enough to help identify people at a checkpoint or counter who are afraid or anxious.</p>",
  "<p>The talking heads are remembering speed and heroin, Rotten Rita and Ondine. It wasn't Danny's lighting that made the Exploding Plastic Inevitable unforgettable, says one of them, it was my coloured projections. Someone else recalls fighting over cables. Over the reminiscences, silvery monochrome footage shows a pale wraith in an immaculate wig in a loft papered with aluminium foil. There's a soundtrack that sounds a bit like the Velvet Underground, but isn't (that, presumably, would be too expensive). Even the feedback seems half-hearted.</p> <p>It feels like a terrible waste of time to have sat through two new documentaries about Andy Warhol's Factory, and I say that as a dedicated Warhol fan. I have, in my time, read much of his book A, a Novel - no more than a transcript of taped chatter by Factory inhabitant Ondine - and I do not regret it. I've been moved by his paintings of plane crashes and nose jobs, and I don't take back a single tear. I think Warhol was a great artist. But at this point I'd rather gaze at the Empire State building for eight hours than see another biopic or documentary that claims to recreate the strange and mysterious world of his New York studio.</p> <p>There is a startling amount of Andy Warhol in recent cinema, and too much entirely about the people who surrounded him. It's not surprising, of course, and Warhol only has himself to blame. He would go and be interesting. Most artists live adventurous lives - being an artist is itself an adventure - and yet few have created as much drama around themselves as Warhol did. The son of poor Slovakian immigrants who barely spoke English, he was physically ugly, gay in a straight age, and drew with competence but nothing you would call genius. But Warhol turned himself into a prophet of modern life, who presided over a beautiful and grotesque alternative community, the Factory, that simultaneously parodied and invented the 1960s. </p> <p>He turned from painting to cinema and from cinema to homespun philosophising, and, when he died suddenly in 1987, he left behind a perhaps insoluble mystery about who he really was: the cold manipulator of \"superstars\", or the devout churchgoer who secretly helped out in New York soup kitchens? The bland observer of celebrity, or the tragic painter of death? There is, I still think, a great film to be made about this consciously strange individual. Unfortunately, none of the endless production line of Factory films even comes close to, or dreams of, overturning the stupidest, most discredited myths about Warhol and his New York.</p> <p>Was he cold, remote, cruel? Some books say not, but who cares? Not the screenwriter or the documentary maker trying to interest backers and producers. In recent years, art historians have uncovered several unexpected Warhols in the copious archives he kept. There is Warhol the friend of poets, whose early associates in the New York avant garde were all serious writers; there is Warhol the religious artist, whose apparently sincere and deep Christianity was only revealed after his death by his friend John Richardson. But these alternative Warhols don't cut it with film-makers convinced that audiences like their avant garde as inhuman as possible, to reassure them that in the end it's better to be a suburbanite than one of those weird artists.</p> <p>It started just four years after Warhol's death, with Oliver Stone's 1991 film The Doors. Admittedly that film didn't do as much harm to Warhol as it did to its hero Jim Morrison, who - it's hard to remember now - was actually quite cool, until Stone turned him into a clunking American monument. Anyway, Jim meets Andy in New York and the pop guru gives him a telephone. Someone gave it to him to talk to God, the bland Warhol explains, but he can't think of anything to say. The Lizard King can, the film implies. </p> <p>It wasn't much of an appearance but it did set a tableau religiously adhered to by film-makers ever since: put your actor in a wig, cover his face with white powder, give him something inane to say, and then contrast him with more manly and hearty representatives of the counterculture. That's exactly how Warhol is played by Guy Pearce, in the recent Edie Sedgwick biopic Factory Girl. Here his rock antithesis is Bob Dylan, who actually did loathe Warhol, and was his rival in 1960s Manhattan. </p> <p>At least Dylan is an interesting character - or should be - to set against Warhol. Increasingly, in the Warhol cinema factory, the artist is just a shadowy figure behind the foreground comings and goings of the misfits and wannabes who were drawn to his studio. This tendency began with Mary Harron's 1996 work I Shot Andy Warhol, a biopic of Valerie Solanas, author of the Scum Manifesto (Scum being the acronym for Society for Cutting Up Men), and attempted Warhol assassin. Unless you think artists deserve to be shot, it's hard to see why Solanas deserved this degree of attention - although Harron's is one film that does try to be realistic about 60s New York, instead of just morbid. Since it was made, however, an army of also-rans in the Warhol story have come out of hiding (in some cases literally). Watch these films and you soon get to know Chuck Wein, Billy Name, Brigid Berlin and a host of lesser hangers-on. It can't be long before \"I was a mouse under the Factory floorboards\" gets greenlighted.</p> <p>Warhol's Factory was a rolling tableau of bohemians and freaks whose casualty rate was high, but not high enough to save filmgoers from a new wave of reminiscence-mongers. Wein, who in Factory Girl is portrayed as a stylish young Harvard graduate, appears in Esther Robinson's forthcoming documentary A Walk Into the Sea - a greyed hippy talking about his own screenplay - working title, Edie, Andy and Chuck. </p> <p>In another new documentary, Face Addict, the fashion photographer Edo Bertoglio revisits Manhattan from the small Italian town where he now lives, to remember and reconnect with the people he knew there as a participant in the new wave scene in the late 1970s and early 80s. These were the years when, after a period of conservatism and caution following his shooting by Solanas, Warhol once again played a central part in avant-garde New York, befriending young artists such as Jean-Michel Basquiat, and musicians like Debbie Harry. </p> <p>Warhol hovers in the background of Face Addict like a hidden god; the sensationalism of Factory Girl is replaced by a reverence so deep that Walter Steding, a punk violinist whom Warhol once managed, is filmed with an adoring respect for every detail of his existence. All the people in the film, with the exception of a brief appearance by Debbie Harry, are bit players in the story of Andy Warhol's New York. </p> <p>On the other hand, A Walk Into the Sea tells the story of the director's uncle, Danny Williams, a boyfriend of Warhol and resident of the Factory who vanished in 1966, apparently drowning himself off the New England coast. What really happened to Danny? The evidence that Danny Williams was damaged by the poisonous atmosphere at the Factory is comprehensive. The people Warhol attracted, says John Cale in the documentary, were not so much damaged as \"incomplete\".</p> <p>And that's how the film feels, how all these films feel. They delve into the details of New York's cultural past yet none of them can tell us why we should be interested. There is one question every film-maker needs to ask him or herself before embarking on a Warhol project: do you admire him as an artist? Does his work mean anything to you personally? Because if you don't see more in Warhol than his fame, why waste your time and ours? </p> <p>The trouble with all these films is their assumption that art happens elsewhere, long ago, to bizarre characters. Art, if it matters, is about your life and mine. One day someone will make a film that actually tries to imagine being Andy Warhol, or Danny Williams. Until that leap is made, the Factory will remain about as worthwhile on screen as an encounter with some old drunk in the East Village who claims to have seen Warhol, once, across a crowded room.</p> <p><strong> \u00b7 A Walk into the Sea</strong> is released on August 17. <strong>Face Addict</strong> is released on August 22.</p>",
  "<p>The outcome of six grim days of bloodshed in the Caucasus has triggered an outpouring of the most nauseating hypocrisy from western politicians and their captive media. As talking heads thundered against Russian imperialism and brutal disproportionality, US vice-president Dick Cheney, faithfully echoed by Gordon Brown and David Miliband, declared that \"Russian aggression must not go unanswered\". George Bush denounced Russia for having \"invaded a sovereign neighbouring state\" and threatening \"a democratic government\". Such an action, he insisted, \"is unacceptable in the 21st century\".</p> <p>Could these by any chance be the leaders of the same governments that in 2003 invaded and occupied - along with Georgia, as luck would have it - the sovereign state of Iraq on a false pretext at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives? Or even the two governments that blocked a ceasefire in the summer of 2006 as Israel pulverised Lebanon's infrastructure and killed more than a thousand civilians in retaliation for the capture or killing of five soldiers?</p> <p>You'd be hard put to recall after all the fury over Russian aggression that it was actually Georgia that began the war last Thursday with an all-out attack on South Ossetia to \"restore constitutional order\" - in other words, rule over an area it has never controlled since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Nor, amid the outrage at Russian bombardments, have there been much more than the briefest references to the atrocities committed by Georgian forces against citizens it claims as its own in South Ossetia's capital Tskhinvali. Several hundred civilians were killed there by Georgian troops last week, along with Russian soldiers operating under a 1990s peace agreement: \"I saw a Georgian soldier throw a grenade into a basement full of women and children,\" one Tskhinvali resident, Saramat Tskhovredov, told reporters on Tuesday.</p> <p>Might it be because Georgia is what Jim Murphy, Britain's minister for Europe, called a \"small beautiful democracy\". Well it's certainly small and beautiful, but both the current president, Mikheil Saakashvili, and his predecessor came to power in western-backed coups, the most recent prettified as a \"Rose revolution\". Saakashvili was then initially rubber-stamped into office with 96% of the vote before establishing what the International Crisis Group recently described as an \"increasingly authoritarian\" government, violently cracking down on opposition dissent and independent media last November. \"Democratic\" simply seems to mean \"pro-western\" in these cases.</p> <p>The long-running dispute over South Ossetia - as well as Abkhazia, the other contested region of Georgia - is the inevitable consequence of the breakup of the Soviet Union. As in the case of Yugoslavia, minorities who were happy enough to live on either side of an internal boundary that made little difference to their lives feel quite differently when they find themselves on the wrong side of an international state border. </p> <p>Such problems would be hard enough to settle through negotiation in any circumstances. But add in the tireless US promotion of Georgia as a pro-western, anti-Russian forward base in the region, its efforts to bring Georgia into Nato, the routing of a key Caspian oil pipeline through its territory aimed at weakening Russia's control of energy supplies, and the US-sponsored recognition of the independence of Kosovo - whose status Russia had explicitly linked to that of South Ossetia and Abkhazia - and conflict was only a matter of time. </p> <p>The CIA has in fact been closely involved in Georgia since the Soviet collapse. But under the Bush administration, Georgia has become a fully fledged US satellite. Georgia's forces are armed and trained by the US and Israel. It has the third-largest military contingent in Iraq - hence the US need to airlift 800 of them back to fight the Russians at the weekend. Saakashvili's links with the neoconservatives in Washington are particularly close: the lobbying firm headed by US Republican candidate John McCain's top foreign policy adviser, Randy Scheunemann, has been paid nearly $900,000 by the Georgian government since 2004.</p> <p>But underlying the conflict of the past week has also been the Bush administration's wider, explicit determination to enforce US global hegemony and prevent any regional challenge, particularly from a resurgent Russia. That aim was first spelled out when Cheney was defence secretary under Bush's father, but its full impact has only been felt as Russia has begun to recover from the disintegration of the 1990s. </p> <p>Over the past decade, Nato's relentless eastward expansion has brought the western military alliance hard up against Russia's borders and deep into former Soviet territory. American military bases have spread across eastern Europe and central Asia, as the US has helped install one anti-Russian client government after another through a series of colour-coded revolutions. Now the Bush administration is preparing to site a missile defence system in eastern Europe transparently targeted at Russia.</p> <p>By any sensible reckoning, this is not a story of Russian aggression, but of US imperial expansion and ever tighter encirclement of Russia by a potentially hostile power. That a stronger Russia has now used the South Ossetian imbroglio to put a check on that expansion should hardly come as a surprise. What is harder to work out is why Saakashvili launched last week's attack and whether he was given any encouragement by his friends in Washington.</p> <p>If so, it has spectacularly backfired, at savage human cost. And despite Bush's attempts to talk tough yesterday, the war has also exposed the limits of US power in the region. As long as Georgia proper's independence is respected - best protected by opting for neutrality - that should be no bad thing. Unipolar domination of the world has squeezed the space for genuine self-determination and the return of some counterweight has to be welcome. But the process of adjustment also brings huge dangers. If Georgia had been a member of Nato, this week's conflict would have risked a far sharper escalation. That would be even more obvious in the case of Ukraine - which yesterday gave a warning of the potential for future confrontation when its pro-western president threatened to restrict the movement of Russian ships in and out of their Crimean base in Sevastopol. As great power conflict returns, South Ossetia is likely to be only a taste of things to come. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.milne@theguardian.com\">s.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Luxury is an exhausting pursuit. It's also fraught with anxiety. According to its crocodile-skin logic, my individuality is under threat. My very selfhood could be snatched away without warning. Perhaps I once naively imagined I could trip through the cornfields of life without paying much heed to my new watch. Turns out it's not so simple. Now I've been inducted into luxury, I discover I'm going to have to spend an unbelievable amount of money on timepieces just to stand a chance of carrying on being a person. What may have once appeared to me as a pleasurably frivolous purchase is actually a last-ditch attempt to save my soul. </p> <p>It's not just the risk of tumbling down into the purgatory of mass consumption, the fear that I might wake up to find myself eating a kebab on a night bus, wearing a Swatch. It's more the creeping suspicion that everyone else on that night bus would be just the same as me. Not just dressed the same; listening to the same music - even physically looking or speaking the same, but identical in every respect - repetitions, clones with no original.</p> <p>The terror that underlies luxury - that unless I buy a Tag I will forfeit my humanity - is merely a highly strung version of the suggestion made by all consumerism, that the main project in life, its highest end and noblest goal, is individuation. Hostility to the mass is ingrained in the post-Enlightenment liberalism that dominates western political culture, and has only been exacerbated by a century of vicious totalitarianism. The modern cult of luxury is the bastard child of that bleak history. It's fundamentally misanthropic, profoundly scared, snarling at the dollar-a-day world from behind a Fendi fence.</p> <p>Because it hates the masses, whose consumption patterns are insufficiently distinctive (they are \"faceless\", \"teeming\"), whose insectoid presence reminds the luxury consumer of the appalling anonymity of poverty, the destiny that awaits them if they fail to individuate themselves through their purchases. The luxury sector, which spins fantasy worlds out of perfume and leather goods, is merely a symptom of a general cultural tendency to confuse political liberty with material sufficiency, the pseudo-freedom to choose from a predetermined array of consumer goods. </p> <p>Self-fashioning through shopping is a perfect pastime for the modern control society - non-threatening and solipsistic. Unfortunately, money is a poor tool for making yourself distinctive, as evidenced by the fact that most rich people look and behave, well, just like rich people - a repertoire of behaviour as stereotypical and limited as that of any poverty-stricken prole. </p> <p>Money is, of course, a tool of equivalence, of exchange, for making one thing - or person - commensurate with another, so perhaps it's not surprising that the central promise of consumerism turns out to be so hard to fulfil. It's difficult not to laugh when cars, the paradigmatic objects of mass production, are sold as a way of standing out or signalling non-conformity. Luxury recognises the hollowness of mass consumerism's promise of distinctiveness and trumps it by claiming that if the product is sufficiently exclusive, it will perform the work required. </p> <p>However, the logic of luxury heads in the direction of singularity, and the very success of its claims may be leading to its decline. Luxury is slipping downmarket, as branding techniques and the diffuse promises of lifestyle become ever more pervasive. The emergence of \"super-luxury\" or \"uber-premium\" brands is an attempt to recapture lost ground. It's likely to be futile, because if one is aiming for the metaphysical goal of full self-presence through shopping, the knowledge that there is more than one of any given product will always nag at you, threaten you with equivalence, replicability. Your personal uniqueness can only be guaranteed by a unique object. </p> <p>This, more than anything else, explains the unprecedented boom in the art market. Art is not just an uber-premium product. Even if you have enough money, you can't always walk into a gallery and buy the work you want. One needs contacts, reputation, insider knowledge. Ownership of a key piece by a sought-after artist is a badge of selfhood (taste, eye, soul, social network) that no luxury item can provide. </p> <p>The situationists understood that culture is the product that sells all the others, and increasingly it's only culture's aura that allows luxury brands to keep their claims afloat, as they associate themselves with areas of experience that still hold out the promise of individuation - artists and sportsmen being presented as individuals par excellence. So as long as we continue to buy into the threat of luxury brands - that in order to live a full, effective life, to give and receive love, to form relationships and to feel valued then we need to go to Selfridges - we may find it's an activity with diminishing returns. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Hari Kunzru's latest novel is My Revolutions.

  "<p>Paul Scotney, director of integrity services at the British Horseracing Authority, has kept a low profile since the collapse of the Old Bailey \"race-fixing\" trial in December, but his head was back over the parapet this week with his mandatory call on trainers to be instructed on the subject of inside information.</p> <p>Given what looks to be Scotney's unnecessarily heavy-handed approach, with those who do not comply risking losing their licence, it was no surprise to see many trainers up in arms. How much would you have given to be a fly on the wall when Sir Michael Stoute received his directions.</p> <p>But there are implications for punters as well regarding the BHA's definition of inside information, published last year. It identified: \"Information about the likely participation or likely performance of a horse in a race which is known by an owner, trainer, rider, stable employee or their service providers as a result of acting as such and is not information in the public domain.\"</p> <p>Where the \"public domain\" begins and ends is part of the problem. How does Scotney believe a market was formed on the High Street Cafe Maiden Stakes at Newmarket last week? The 17-runner race was confined to unraced two-year-olds and, to the best of my knowledge, Henry Cecil did not make public utterances in advance about the merit of his runner, Wingwalker.</p> <p>Somebody knew something, however, as Wingwalker started 9-4 favourite despite never having been seen or heard of by the majority of punters. Someone was privy to knowledge about Wingwalker's ability and duly profited by it. Have they breached the BHA's code on inside information? If so, questions will have to be asked every time a well-backed newcomer like Wingwalker goes in.</p> <p>The reality is that the use, or misuse, of inside information has only become an issue since the advent of betting exchanges. Measures such as preventing jockeys' agents from laying horses to lose ridden by their clients are only scratching the surface.</p> <p>The BHA's integrity department appears to have total confidence in the exchanges' much vaunted \"paper trail\". But there always remains the opportunity for someone to lay a horse to lose, supported by knowledge not available to all. That is the sort of \"inside information\" the sport can do without, but it won't go away.</p> <p>The form book is the reason behind taking a punt on Percolator when Paul Cole's two-year-old filly tackles her elders in next week's Coolmore Nunthorpe Stakes at York. She has slipped under the radar after doing most of her racing in France, but this speedy juvenile is tempting at 12-1 with just 7st12lb on her back and William Buick doing the steering. </p> <h2>For the notebook</h2> <p><strong>Silent Hero</strong> Newmarket 7f</p> <p>Michael Jarvis's colt, who had finished fourth behind his useful looking stable companion Playfellow at Haydock, has started life off a lenient mark in handicaps and he looked unlucky not to collect here. Denied a clear run going into the final furlong, Silent Hero picked up well to finish a close fourth behind Battle Of Hastings. He will have no trouble winning a similar event, and a mile should suit him.</p> <p><strong>Delegator</strong> Newmarket 7f</p> <p>Brian Meehan's two-year-olds invariably need their first run, so it was particularly encouraging to see this colt go close on his debut. Soon recovering from a slow start, he made smooth headway to lead a furlong out before the well-backed Wingwalker took control. Entered in October's Dewhurst Stakes, Delegator has a bright future.</p>",
  "<p>Rob Purdham's unorthodox rugby league career has already taken him from a farm near Sellafield to the suburbia of Surbiton. Now Harlequins' low-profile Cumbrian captain has his sights set further afield, with every chance a big performance against the Super League leaders, St Helens, this weekend could see him become the surprise package in England's World Cup squad.</p> <p>\"That would be most young rugby league people's dream and I'm no different,\" said the 28-year-old, whose improvement as a goalkicker since he started working with the Harlequins union fly-half Chris Malone has particularly interested the England coach, Tony Smith.</p> <p>\"I grew up as a kid watching the greats like Ellery Hanley, Andy Gregory, Mike Gregory and Shaun Edwards playing out in Australia. I'm not boasting that I'm going to be picked but this might be the best chance I'm going to get. It's a big incentive for me and a few of the other guys at Quins for the rest of the season.\"</p> <p>Many believe that Purdham, who is primarily a back-row forward but has the ability to play at centre - and, crucially, has a reputation for running and tackling well above his weight in any position - would already have added senior international recognition to the appearances he has made in various England development teams if he had not suffered a series of injuries at unfortunate times.</p> <p>But he seems to be timing his late-season charge to perfection, with outstanding individual performances in consecutive Quins' victories over Bradford and Hull KR - where he kicked eight goals from eight attempts in a 40-16 win - that have revived the London club's hopes of qualifying for the top-six play-offs.</p> <p>\"We've just said to ourselves as a group that it's still in our hands and if we win our games, which we think we're good enough to do, we can still make it,\" Purdham added. \"But it's going to be a massive challenge to do that against Saints. Warrington dominated them last week and they still won. To have any chance we'll have to play as strong and fast as they do and put our bodies in positions where they probably shouldn't be put.\"</p> <p>Purdham's willingness to do that has contributed to the injury problems he has suffered over the last few years. But with a place in the World Cup - which takes place in Australia at the end of October - up for grabs, there is no chance of him changing that playing style now.</p> <p>\"I've got no doubts that he's exactly the sort of bloke they're going to need out in Australia,\" says Tony Rea, Purdham's former London Broncos coach. \"This isn't bias, it's the way the blokes who have played with him think about him too.</p> <p>\"Jimmy Dymock [a World Cup winner with Australia in 1995 who played for the Broncos with Purdham] always used to say that people missed the point with this bloke, and didn't realise how good he is. It's his team-mates who will tell you about the timing of his plays, and the fact that he does all the tough stuff.</p> <p>\"I remember the Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett saying when he was asked about Scott Prince during this year's State of Origin series that he wouldn't be silly enough not to pick him. That's the way I feel about Purdo.\" Rea believes that Purdham's background in farming is a big part of his appeal, just as it was with the unheralded but uncompromising Yorkshire second-rows of the past such as Paul Dixon and Karl Fairbank who earned respect from the Australians. \"You are what you are and I think with the challenges they're going to be facing out there, the fact that Rob comes from a different point of view will be helpful to the group,\" he added.</p> <p>\"Most of the work I did was on my dad's farm in Gosforth, a little place not far from Sellafield,\" Purdham said. \"Then me and my brother had a little farm between us with a few cows and sheep. I was happy enough doing that and playing for Whitehaven when the Broncos, as they were then, came in for me and I signed for them in December 2001. I'd never been to London at that stage and I still didn't for a bit because we went on a training camp out in Australia for six weeks. I came back to London from there and that was it - I've been here ever since. I'm getting married at the end of the year and I call it my home now. It's like 2.4 children - except we've got dogs.\"</p> <p>\"I really admire him for giving up what he knew up north and taking the chance,\" added Rea. \"But I think he made us have as much of a Cumbrian outlook as we turned him into a Londoner. He's been great for the club as well as the team.\"</p>",
  "<p>The littlest Geordie of them all held a captive audience in thrall yesterday, as he recounted the trials and tribulations of being a mere 4ft 91/2ins. The occasion was a plug for Wee Georgie Wood's essay in this week's Nursing Mirror on the physical and psychological problems of being what are now called 'persons of restricted growth'. </p> <p>Mr Wood, who is a with-it 80, pointed out that it was also to remind people that he was still alive. He has lived in Bloomsbury for 25 years - a far cry from Jarrow-on-Tyne, where he was one of 21 children. He went on the boards before he was six, and has been around ever since. </p> <p>His partner in music-hall jest, Dolly Harmer, has been dead for many years, and his mother, who loomed large and took his profits, died in 1946.</p> <p>Mr Wood said cheerfully that one of the worst things about being tiny was being patted on the head by well-meaning 'grown-ups'. Another was that people assumed that small brains go with diminutive bodies. </p> <p>Mr Wood, who happens to have made more of a mark than most people, said he thought he could </p> <p>have done pretty well at anything. But his mother had discovered an Eldorado, and she was not going to let it vanish.</p> <p>'I would have liked to have been a lawyer or a journalist,' he said. </p> <p>'The late Lord Birkett encouraged me to study law when he was in chambers in Birmingham. But \"Wee Georgie Wood\" had been treading the boards too long by then.'</p> <p>A good friend was the late Sir Neville Cardus, who introduced him to the Guardian's late editor, C. P. Scott. 'Mr Scott liked me because I could listen, and he liked to talk,' he said. He was urged to write by George Bernard Shaw and Hannen Swaffer. He still writes Stage Man's Diary in Stage and Television Today.</p> <p>Mr Wood has been accustomed to being small; after all, he's had a long time to get used to it - since the shattering news at nineteen that he would grow no more. </p> <p>'I used to try to counter being small by phoney dignity. Then I had a period as a crusader when I tried to right the midget's world. The only time I feel big is in the House of Commons,' he said.</p> <p>He said that parents of dwarfed children should find the finest endocrinologist around. If nothing can be done, there is always the comforting thought that Keats, Pope, Swinburne, and Marat were all between 4ft 7in and 5 ft 1 in. Not to mention Mr Wood himself.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/hc0708/hc09/0947/0947.pdf\">recent report</a> by the Interception of Communications commissioner, Sir Paul Kennedy notes that 519,260 requisitions of communications data from telephone companies and internet service providers were made in Britain last year. It is very mysterious who is doing the bulk of this spying, since no statistical breakdown is offered. But Sir Paul suggests the procedures may be a bit much for local authorities and things ought to be made easier for them.</p> <p>The Home Office is busy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/aug/13/privacy.civilliberties\">doing just that</a>. It is shortly to compel telecoms companies and internet service providers to keep details of all your emailing, browsing and phonecalls for up to 24 months. And it will specify in what form the information is to be kept. It is heartening that press and public have woken up to this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/aug/13/privacy.civilliberties&quot;\">snoopers' charter</a> just as the final piece of the picture is hammered into place. It is being introduced in the form of a Statutory Instrument enforcing an EU directive - which means it is unlikely to be even debated in parliament and cannot be amended by our elected representatives. Perhaps that is why this is being released while MPs are on holiday. They don't matter to the process.</p> <p>The Home Office is taking the maximum powers allowed under the directive - which shouldn't be a surprise, as the directive itself was inspired by lobbying from <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4668903.stm\">Charles Clarke</a> in the council of ministers when he was home secretary. The minimum six months' retention is probably what we will see in Germany, which resisted the exercise; the Home Office is taking powers for four times as long.</p> <p>All this is the logical pursuit of the path set out in the <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/ukpga_20000023_en_1\">Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000</a>, and most of the debate is founded on the false premise that this was a special anti-terrorist power that somehow got out of hand when councils started using it to pursue litterers. It just isn't true. RIPA was always a snooper's charter, as the Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2000/mar/30/freespeech.onlinesupplement\">noted at the time</a>. Its function is to provide a bureaucratic mechanism by which hundreds of different official bodies from MI5 to Ofcom can authorise their staff to use surveillance. It is purposely obscure and hard to challenge.</p> <p>The Interception Commissioner doesn't exercise direct oversight of individual cases. He could hardly do so for half a million of them.</p> <p>Read his report and you'll see he is only interested in how well the relevant bodies are maintaining procedural propriety by following official Codes of Practice. He's not the only one who thinks surveillance should be easier. The <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2541476/Councils-are-not-snooping-enough-says-spying-watchdog.html\">Telegraph</a> reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>To free up police time the Conservatives would axe the requirement for RIPA clearance for CCTV surveillance, using automatic number plate recognition software and public surveillance of a building. RIPA authorisations would also not be required for commissioning covert recording or bugging of a house or car, or using thermal or x-ray surveillance of a building.</p> </blockquote> <p>Dominic Grieve, the shadow home secretary - who I thought was a man of liberal principle - is quoted as saying: \"It is not right that we charge our police with combating crime and disorder and then tie their hands behind their backs in the name of Whitehall bureaucracy.\" </p> <p>This is embarrassing claptrap from a man who knows better. The answer to the over-bureaucratic control of surveillance is not to scrap control, but to give it to the courts. If a policeman wants to look in your desk drawer without your knowledge he needs a good excuse, and probably a warrant. Looking at your browsing or your phone records reveals at least as much private information. Doing it secretly is not very different from burgling your house. It is a personal violation that needs strong justification and strong oversight. To me that means a judicial warrant.</p> <p>Rather than \"continued discharge of the functions of any public authority whose activities include activities that are subject to review\", a system is needed that would serve a real public interest in liberty and privacy. Not some broad-brush review of bureaucratic activities, not qualified and approved in-house assessors of procedure and proportionality, but a court to decide on the merits of each investigation before surveillance was authorised. Given fair warrants we need not rely on the telecoms providers appealing to surveillance tribunals behind closed doors, nor would there be such a good excuse for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/20/informationinformationinformation\">mass surveillance</a> on the pretext of making life easier for everyone involved. It would be clear that this is a serious matter and only permitted for good reason.</p> <p>In 1999 the president of Sun Microsystems, Scott McNealy, famously <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/1999/01/17538\"> said</a>: \"You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it.\" That caused outrage. But the context was technological capacity and consumerism. It wasn't a moral statement about how to run the world. A decade on, UK legislators and officials apparently see zero privacy as a legitimate aspiration of government. They are wrong.</p>",
  "<p>David Miliband demonstrated a touching taste for modern diplomatic alphabet soup when he headed off this morning to discuss the Georgia crisis with fellow European foreign ministers. He declared to the BBC that Nato, the EU, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and UN were the means for delivering a just and stable solution to the latest gunfight in the Caucasus.</p> <p>This is worrying. All four organisations have a strong record on delivery falling far short of their rhetoric \u2013 most particularly so in the case of Nato and the OSCE. It was feared that when Nato expanded into eastern Europe after the end of the cold war, it was offering a promissory note it stood no chance of redeeming, particularly in the case of the Baltic states which were the most eager applicants to join the alliance.</p> <p>Like it or not, the alliance always hinged on article five of its <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/docu/basictxt/treaty.htm\">founding treaty</a>, and it still does. This is the clause that could have been written by Dumas' Three Musketeers. It says, essentially: \"All for one and one for all\". This is the bit that clearly attracts leaders like Mikheil Saakashvili, the Georgian president, to the club. France for one, and the UK not far behind, believe that both Georgia and Ukraine should be admitted to full membership. If they really mean it, we can expect a lot more stormy weather in the east. A spokesman for the French foreign ministry said, in the past 48 hours, that \"the door for Georgian membership of Nato remains firmly ajar.\"</p> <p>Article five has been invoked fully only once in the history of the alliance, and in all nearly twice. It was invoked in the aftermath of 9/11 as a response to an attack by a \"foreign power\" on US domestic sovereign territory. There was also serious debate about whether the article should have been invoked if Saddam's forces crossed into Turkey during the Kuwait invasion crisis of 1990-1991.</p> <p>Imagine Georgia had been a member of Nato when the present <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">crisis</a> began, or even a serious candidate member. If article five's request for immediate military support had been invoked, less than half a dozen of the existing membership could have done anything at all. The US is so badly overcommitted in Iraq and Afghanistan that it could only move minimal forces at short notice. Of the European allies, only the UK and France have the vestiges of an expeditionary capability, and most of that is used up already in Iraq and Afghanistan in the case of Britain, and Afghanistan, Lebanon and Africa in the case of France.</p> <p>The Georgia crisis should be a much needed reality check for Nato, and not an occasion for militaristic bluster. It is time for its member governments to reflect on what the alliance is for, and what it can really do. It should not be a diplomatic bulldozer for corralling Russia along the eastern marches of Europe. For this reason, among others, Ukraine and Georgia should not be given Nato membership, but some other security guarantee in which Nato and Russia are equal signatories.</p> <p>Georgia is a symptom of a broader Nato malfunction. Since the 1999 <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/docu/comm/1999/9904-wsh/9904-wsh.htm\">Washington summit</a>, Nato has taken on a global expeditionary role under what was then described as the alliance's \"new strategic concept\". That strategic concept has been undermined since the American-British intervention in Iraq. Its first major operation beyond its original defence area (\"from the Atlantic to the Urals\" in the original treaty) in Afghanistan is now at serious risk of losing focus. One wonders if Nato is the right organisation for running an assistance operation like <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/ISAF/index.html\">Isaf</a> \u2013 particularly as well under a third of the alliance nations are prepared to employ arms to any effective purpose in the mission.</p> <p>The same genetic disorder haunts the EU foreign and security policy arm, and the UN \u2013 high on rhetoric, low on the means to achieve practical results. President Sarkozy, and his foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, according to the voices from Tbilisi and the Elys\u00e9e, are talking about sending an EU peacekeeping force to South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Somebody should restrain them from such an ill-considered gesture \u2013 at best they would be keeping the peace where there is little to keep, and at worst Sarkozy and Kouchner would be delivering a handful of hostages and kidnap candidates.</p> <p>The OSCE is a different matter. Its <a href=\"http://www.osce.org/item/4046.html\">founding document (pdf)</a>, the Helsinki Final Act, strikes at the heart of the crisis in Georgia, and almost anyone else where minority rights and self-determination are under threat. The organisation came into being in the depths of the cold war \u2013 surprisingly so. It was supported by the US and western European nations as well as the Soviet Union.</p> <p>The articles of the Final Act uphold the right of religious and ethnic minorities to self-determination, while at the same time maintain that recognised borders of sovereign territories should not be altered by violence and aggression. These propositions lie at the heart of the contest between Moscow and Tbilisi \u2013 as they do in the question of Kosovo, the wars of Yugoslavia's dissolution and dozens of other disputes that continue to spark brushfire wars across the world.</p> <p>One of the striking aspects of the Georgia crisis is the absence of ideology. There has been no invocation of great heroes or great theorists \u2013 the biggest Georgian of them all, Josef Stalin, has been put under a shroud by both principal parties. The presiding shades have been those of the <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;id=NAB0VtXCggIC&amp;dq=the+art+of+war+Sun+Tzu&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=TcfOuQQOSp&amp;sig=WuI4ozAZ7Vpn2ugRh1_-UVchYTY&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result\">Sun Tzu</a> and <a href=\"http://www.constitution.org/mac/prince00.htm\">Machiavelli</a> \u2013 who advocated that above all a successful commander must exploit opportunity presented suddenly on the battlefield \u2013 fortuna, as the Machiavelli put it in the The Prince.</p> <p>When Georgian forces advanced on the South Ossetian capital last Thursday, they presented the Russians with their moment of fortuna. It allowed them to re-assert their military might and claim the \"security space of their regional neighbourhood\". This sounds an extraordinarily cynical piece of contemporary geopolitics-speak \u2013 but after all it is only a variant of the notion of \"vital interests\" of imperial powers through the centuries.</p> <p>This morning, the BBC's diplomatic correspondent suggested that \"Russia may find itself the diplomatic loser\" in the present crisis. This may indeed be the comforting chatter in the chanceries of Europe and America right now, but as the sacked secretary of the Florentine republic, one Nicol\u00f2 Machiavelli, would say \u2013 it is beside the point.</p>",
  "<p>Under the amusingly euphemistic headline \"Enthusiasm gap plagues GOP convention,\" the DC newspaper the Politico <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12476.html\">reports</a> that Republicans aren't fired up about their nominating extravaganza scheduled for the first week of September in lovely St Paul, Minnesota.</p> <p>There's a lot of expositional excuse-making about St Paul's lack of proximity to the Beltway and its comparatively sedate reputation. The last GOP convention was held in New York City, which not only provided loads of <a href=\"http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/rnc/9681/\">wholesome entertainment</a> for the \"Family Values\" crowd, but also had the added benefit of providing the perfect backdrop for the ritualistic exploitation of the 2001 attack on NYC's World Trade Centre, <a href=\"http://www.gwu.edu/~action/2004/repconv04/giuliani083004sp.html\">led by</a> 9/11 \u00fcberghoul Rudy Giuliani. St Paul's got none of that sparkle, so goes the argument.</p> <p>But it is the unidentified press secretary for an unnamed Republican senator who is, from behind her or his cloak of anonymity, willing to be the most honest about the \"enthusiasm gap\" plaguing the GOP convention: \"Nobody likes a funeral.\"</p> <p>Well, nobody who cared about the deceased, anyway.</p> <p>But I sincerely doubt I'm the only person wishing that Bush Brand Conservatism were given a proper burial with an actual grave, just so I could piss on it.</p> <p>What is, in equal parts, stunning and horrifying and impressive about the spectacular death of Bush Brand Conservatism is that it was mortally wounded not because it was a failure, but because it was an unmitigated success.</p> <p>Bush was the golden boy of modern American conservatives - a rightwing ideologue with no checks or balances, left to pursue every conservative wet dream with abandon. Upstairs and downstairs at the same time, he appealed equally to white, working class bigots whose jobs were being shipped offshore and to the barrel-chested tycoons of a new Gilded Age who raucously bellowed about the superfluity of a social safety net and roared that the government \"never gave me anything!\" while depositing million-dollar profits from their latest no-bid defence contract and buying themselves new yachts with their fat tax returns.</p> <p>It was this corporate shill with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2008/aug/12/bushlol?picture=336501043\">affected demeanour of a country bumpkin</a> who was able to hold together the unholy alliance between Big Money and Big Religion, standing at the altar and giving the blessing to the crackpot marriage between the business interests who sought to get rich off the stupid snivelling sods who marched in hypocritical lockstep with the warmongers and the corporate mercenaries, as long as they were promised protection from radical feminists and kissing boys. Bush spoke the language of robber barons and Nascar dads, of war profiteers and preachers. He told them they were the patriots, the Real Americans - and they gave him their votes, while the media gave him a free pass.</p> <p>He <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2006/04/30/bush_challenges_hundreds_of_laws/\">thumbed his nose at the law</a>. And the opposition party, such as it was, <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2006/05/interesting.html\">took impeachment off the table</a>.</p> <p>He got (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Marriage_Amendment\">almost</a>) everything he wanted, everything Conservatism wanted.</p> <p>As a result, the hideous underbelly of unfettered authoritarian conservatism was exposed as the grotesque mosaic of avarice, antipathy, incompetence and corruption that it is - hostile not only to the laws and liberties and democratic traditions of this nation, but to its very people. Who finally, at long last, stopped breathing life into Bush Brand Conservatism.</p> <p>Now, even as McCain's campaign fights to keep it on life support, his own party is ready to pull the plug. There can be no regeneration, no rebirth, no re-emergence, no reclamation of the majority until the beast is good and dead. Time to let it die. They know it's over.</p> <p>St Paul's as good a place as any for a funeral.</p>",

  "<p>The revulsion at the prospect of another out-and-out Blairite, David Miliband, securing the leadership of the Labour party has led a number of the large affiliated unions to begin to take steps to put forward <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/10/alanjohnson.tradeunions\">a credible alternative slate</a>.</p> <p>This, belatedly, acknowledges that these unions made a pretty big mistake by not only backing Brown but ensuring there was no contest to him a little than a year ago.</p> <p>But time has marched on. The \"dream ticket\" being touted by these unions is a marriage of the political right and left within the Labour party, namely, current health secretary, Alan Johnson, and Jon Cruddas, former link-man between Blair and the unions. Johnson is being spoken of as a serious leadership candidate with Cruddas as his running mate for the deputy-leadership position.</p> <p>Johnson's credentials are that he was a former general secretary of the postal workers' union and has been more personable, down-to-earth and amenable in his various government posts. But he left the Communication Workers' Union under a cloud after being accused of failing to stand up to Royal Mail and is still very much a New Labour politician.</p> <p>The credentials of Cruddas are that he has an understanding of unions, is on the soft left \u2013 being a main mover in the social democratic group <a href=\"http://www.compassonline.org.uk/\" \">Compass</a>, and in the election for deputy leader last year, secured the highest number of first-preference votes (largely because of union support). On the downside for the unions, a Cruddas-Johnson ticket would have been better but Cruddas \u2013 so the argument goes - does not have the ministerial experience and lacks a higher profile in the party. But just as importantly \u2013 and compared to someone like John McDonnell MP \u2013 Cruddas is <a href=\"http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/mp.php?mpn=Jon_Cruddas&amp;mpc=Dagenham\">not that leftwing</a> and does not support all the policies that the left unions have.</p> <p>So the dream ticket is not so much a dream one as a quickly cobbled together one from a sparse field. Indeed, Johnson is still on holiday and has yet to accept (or decline) the unions' kind candidature. Behind this, there are far more important issues. </p> <p>This ticket could easily go the way of other previous \"dream tickets\", such as Neil Kinnock and Roy Hattersley or Tony Blair and John Prescott, either because they never have lived up to the expectations of their union supporters and/or because the leader always has the upper hand over the deputy. In the current reincarnation, a still-confirmed New Labourite would dominate over a disillusioned New Labourite. So the unions are unlikely to get much of what they want on the policy front from this ticket of desperation.</p> <p>More significantly, the unions are seriously mistaken if they think that changing the leadership and a bit of policy tinkering will reverse Labour's fortunes \u2013 which is just what the Johnson-Cruddas ticket implies. This is because the Labour brand is now so damaged from either a new or old Labour perspective and the party is now a hollowed-out shell of its former self. </p> <p>Even more pertinently, though, is that this changing the leadership without much in the way of changing the policies of the current Labour government is too little, too late. Time is not on the side of radical change from within Labour.</p> <p>So, while the unions are to be commended for taking lead and trying to force the pace of some change, rather than waiting to see who they can choose from those that come forward themselves, the ticket of desperation is, in fact, another instance of top-down technocratic managerialism rather than the democratic process and participation, much less one of renewal. </p> <p>If the unions really had the conviction of their policy commitments, surely, they would put forward John McDonnell as a part-player in some of all these current machinations. They snubbed him last time but second time around backing McDonnell might suggest they were playing the long game.

  "<p>The US and the Europe today demanded that any settlement of the conflict in Georgia had to be based on recognition of the small Black Sea country's territorial integrity. But after overrunning Georgia in five days with troops, tanks, and bombers, Russia rejected the terms.</p> <p>The EU unveiled a blueprint for ending the bloodshed in Georgia following several days of French-led shuttle diplomacy between Moscow and Tbilisi that resulted in a six-point plan underpinning a fragile ceasefire.</p> <p>George Bush warned the Kremlin that it had to \"keep its word and act to end this crisis.\"</p> <p>But Russia refused to accept those terms, declined to acknowledge Georgian sovereignty over all of its recognised territory, and refused to have any reference to it in the six-point peace plan mediated by the French and agreed by both Moscow and Tbilisi.</p> <p>European states agreed to dispatch scores of ceasefire monitors to Georgia as quickly as possible in the hope of securing the truce announced on yesterday. They may also lead an international peacekeeping mission to Georgia if the Georgians and Russians agree and a UN mandate is obtained, senior European officials said.</p> <p>The Russians and the Georgians agreed to \"international discussions\" on South Ossetia and Abkhazia, but the Russians kept their options open on the two pro-Russian breakaway provinces.</p> <p>An EU statement said any peace settlement had to be based on Georgia's recognised territorial integrity. Speaking at the White House, Bush said: \"The United States of America stands with the democratically elected government of Georgia. We insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia be respected.\"</p> <p>But Sergei Ivanov, Russia's deputy prime minister and former defence minister, repeatedly refused to recognize Georgian control over its territory.</p> <p>\"We recognise the sovereignty and independence of Georgia ... But territorial integrity, it's just another matter,\" he told BBC's Hardtalk. \"South Ossetia and Abkhazia never were part of Georgia as an independent country.\"</p> <p>The foreign ministers of the 27 EU countries interrupted their holidays for an emergency session on the Caucasus crisis today in Brussels. France's foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, just back from the conflict zone, admitted that the deal he and President Nicolas Sarkozy mediated was \"partially unsatisfactory\", but that the priority was to obtain a durable ceasefire before embarking on more substantive political negotiations.</p> <p>The points agreed by Moscow and Tbilisi proscribe the use of force, pledge a ceasefire and guarantee access for humanitarian aid. But the political and military aspects of the agreement are problematic and the deal could yet unravel.</p> <p>At Russian insistence, Georgian forces have to return to bases while Russian \"peacekeepers\" in the contested northern province of South Ossetia are allowed to stage security patrols \"and additional security measures\" until an \"international mechanism\" is agreed.</p> <p>\"That gives the Russians undefined security rights in undefined territory in Georgia. That's an invitation to further problems,\" the Swedish foreign minister, Carl Bildt, told the Guardian.</p> <p>The Russians, whose invasion of Georgia at the weekend has shocked the west and which today stirred more detailed talk of specific sanctions against Russia, agreed to \"international negotiations on the modalities of security and stability\" in South Ossetia and Abkhazia after having initially demanded talks on the status of the two provinces.</p> <p>Both regions have been beyond the Georgian government's control since the early 90s and the small ethnic wars that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union. President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia launched an abortive and disastrous bid to retake control of South Ossetia last week only to see his country invaded by the Russians and his military crushed.</p> <p>Prospective western reprisals against Moscow came into clearer focus today, with the Americans calling a special session of Nato foreign ministers which could decide to suspend Russia's formal consultative link with the western alliance while David Milliband, the foreign secretary, suggested Russia could be expelled from the G8 and that the EU could halt negotiations just started on a far-reaching strategic partnership pact between Russia and Europe.</p> <p>\"The Russians have been in breach of international law. There will be consequences of some sort,\" said Bildt.</p> <p>But any such moves will trigger resistance in a divided EU. Brussels' attempts to play the key mediating role also limit its scope for taking sides. </p> <p>\"We don't have time now to get into long discussions on blame,\" said Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German foreign minister.</p> <p>\"We shouldn't make any moral judgments on this war. Stopping the war, that's what we're interested in,\" said Kouchner. \"Don't ask us who's good and who's bad here.\"</p> <p>Saakashvili accused the west - the Americans, Nato, and the EU - of disunity on the crisis and of consistently underestimating the Russian threat.</p> <p>\"The response has not been adequate. It looks like appeasement to me. We need real action, not just words.\"</p>",
  "<p>If the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/14/world/europe/14georgia.html\">shaky cease-fire</a> takes hold in Georgia, then the 21st century's version of the Six Day war may mercifully be coming to an end. That will come as a relief - especially for those caught up in the fighting, and for American and European leaders whose <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/08/20080809-2.html\">impotence</a> in stopping the Russian advance has been laid bare before the world.</p> <p>The unfortunate lesson of the Russo-Georgian war is that this is the first tangible example outside of the Middle East of how George Bush's catastrophic foreign policy has weakened the US and the West. The next American president has been dealt a terrible hand - but he must take immediate steps to prevent this situation from getting worse.</p> <p>The root causes of the West's alarming helplessness lie in the broad strategic failure of the Bush administration's foreign policy. It first alienated and then <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1392791.stm\">badly misread Putin's character and intentions</a>, only realising his true threat to Western interests after it was too late. The administration then invaded Iraq, splitting the Western alliance, undermining international institutions, and bogging down American troops in a long and bloody occupation that has eroded the West's deterrent force. Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib have weakened respect for international norms and further damaged <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/06/27/news/pew.php\">American global leadership</a>. Iran has been the major regional beneficiary of the US invasion, projecting power across the Middle East through its support of militants in Iraq, Lebanon, and the Palestinian territories. </p> <p>America's struggles, Iran's gains and Israel's fears together significantly increase Russia's leverage and influence. The US and Europe need Russian cooperation to curtail Iranian nuclear weapons development because Moscow can make or break economic sanctions and any long term solution is going to require Russian support.</p> <p>Beyond these strategic gifts from the US, Russia itself has gained strength and is no longer the weak and declining superpower that characterised much of the post-Soviet period. A booming economy built on soaring energy prices and a strong autocratic government have fed into Putin's efforts to restore the confidence and pride of the once-great Russian nation. This new Russia now seeks to reclaim its place on the world stage.</p> <p>In a feeble bid to push back, the Bush administration feted the democratically elected governments of Ukraine and Georgia as the antidote to the Kremlin's ambitions. Bush went to Tbilisi and <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/05/20050510-2.html\">promised the Georgians</a> that \"as you build a free and democratic Georgia, the American people will stand with you.\" Georgia even sent 2,000 troops to fight in Iraq. It was not unreasonable for the Georgians to think that America would back them. Of course Putin knew that it could not. </p> <p>John McCain has no understanding of just how weak America's position is in this crisis and his response has been to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/12/us/politics/12mccain.html\">escalate the confrontation</a> with Russia - putting America and the world on a dangerous course towards conflict should he become US president. Drawing <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/12/AR2008081202935.html\">obvious allusions</a> to Hitler's march into the Sudetenland, McCain said of Russia's rout of Georgian forces: \"we learned at great cost the price of allowing aggression against free nations to go unchecked.\" He compounds the irresponsible rhetoric of the Bush administration, yet he proposes nothing to address America's complete lack of leverage. </p> <p>Even though it is unlikely that Russia will again resort to force in the near future, it is guaranteed to press its advantage in countries like Ukraine and other former Soviet republics. If America and the West are to summon any meaningful response, we must stop issuing hollow threats and begin to address Russia's current points of leverage. </p> <p>The first step is to get serious about resolving the nuclear standoff with Iran. Putin's trump card is that the West is appropriately more concerned about an aggressive nuclear armed Iran than it is about Russia asserting control over its near abroad. Russia's clear power play has raised the stakes in reaching an acceptable settlement with Tehran and we simply cannot allow that process to drag on indefinitely while Russia presses its advantage and Israel grows more concerned. </p> <p>A great deal of Russia's economic power is based on rising energy prices and its massive reserves of natural gas. That is not likely to change in the short term, but it is possible to lower energy costs and lessen the strategic importance of fossil fuel reserves by transforming our economies to run on renewable energy sources. This would create a finite time horizon after which Russia's dominant energy position will be less significant. </p> <p>The energy boom has generated enormous wealth in Russia that has covered over numerous looming crises. Its public institutions are rife with corruption, its infrastructure is crumbling, its health system is a shambles, and it is facing a demographic time bomb of an aging population and a rapidly declining birth-rate. These are all areas in which the US and Europe can help improve the lives of the Russian people. Doing so would require a difficult shift in the orientation of aid programs away from a focus on democracy promotion, but it has the chance of reversing the reputation of the West within Russia and lessening the appetite for confrontation. </p> <p>These soft power moves must also be accompanied by the restoration of the credibility of American hard power by bringing the occupation of Iraq to a responsible conclusion. Only then can we reset our military forces and restore their deterrent capabilities. Russia does not want to get into a shooting war with the United States. It can act aggressively now because it knows that is not a realistic possibility. A credible deterrent of strong and united Western forces would surely help dissuade Putin from rash actions.</p> <p>Barack Obama has put forward a comprehensive foreign and security policy compatible with each of these steps: early and high-level negotiations with Iran; transitioning towards a green economy; emphasising human dignity and peoples' needs and aspirations in US aid programs; and ending the war in Iraq. John McCain proposes doing none of these things as he hurtles towards confrontation with both Russia and Iran, seemingly intent on turning this bad situation into a terrifying one.</p>",

  "<p>As I locked the door of my apartment in Tbilisi at around midnight and got in a car to head for the border, I felt like a traitor. I was leaving <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">Georgia</a> at a moment when my adopted home, and my friends there, felt more threatened than they had been in many years. I had my own reasons \u2013 the impending birth of my first child \u2013 but I still felt I was deserting them.</p> <p>I lingered for a while at my local shop, where a small crowd of neighbours had gathered around an old <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lada\">Lada</a> with its radio on, trying to work out exactly how close the Russian tanks were to the capital. \"You're the foreigner who lives here,\" one of them correctly identified me, before asking, \"Will the west help us, or are we on our own?\"</p> <p>That was one of the questions that many people have been asking over the past few days in Tbilisi, as the crushing reality of Georgia's defeat <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/13/georgia.russia6\">has become clear</a>. There's been a sense of disillusionment that the government's western allies, particularly the United States, haven't been more robust in their response in their response to Moscow's military assault.</p> <p>\"Where is Bush? Where are his weapons?\" demanded one woman, who had fled to the capital from her village in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/13/georgia.russia\">South Ossetia</a>. She pointed out that Georgians had died in Iraq while serving alongside the US president's military mission there. \"But when we needed him,\" she cried, \"all he gave us was words.\" </p> <p>Many people do seem to have had unrealistic expectations that the US and the EU would ride to the rescue. But that doesn't mean that their feeling that the west has left them alone to face the might of the Russian army isn't genuine.</p> <p>Other locals spoke of bringing their old guns out of their basements and cleaning them, ready to resist the Russians, guerrilla-style, if they advanced on the capital. One of my best friends, a child psychologist, whom one could never describe as warlike, told me that the Georgian army had to fight on to the end, to show the world that Russia's behaviour was simply unacceptable in the 21st century \u2013 even if, she declared, that meant that everyone had to die.</p> <p>Many Georgians have been unwilling to criticise President <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/10/russia.georgia2\">Mikheil Saakashvili</a>'s strategy publicly while Russian tanks are rolling across Georgian soil and Russian warplanes are in Georgian skies. Even <a href=\"http://blogs.tol.org/conflicts/\">some of the people</a> who accused Saakashvili of falsifying elections earlier this year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/13/georgia.russia1\">have rallied</a> behind the war effort.</p> <p>But privately, a few have expressed concerns that Saakashvili \u2013 or \"Misha\", as he's known to almost everyone in Georgia \u2013 might have made <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/10/georgia.russia\">a fatal miscalculation</a> in trying to seize back control of South Ossetia from the Moscow-backed separatists, thus invoking the wrath of a ruthless Kremlin. \"Didn't Misha remember what Putin did in Chechnya?\" a student friend asked me. </p> <p>No one really knows how many have died in this conflict so far. But many people have lost friends. I want to take this opportunity to remember <a href=\"http://www.caucasus-images.com/?ID=VD5K6KSAKQ\">Alexander Klimchuk</a>, colleague and occasional beer-drinking companion, a 27-year-old Georgian photojournalist who <a href=\"http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=28135&amp;annee=2008\">was shot dead</a> in unclear circumstances while photographing the fighting in South Ossetia a few days ago.</p> <p>Last autumn, Klimchuk and I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/nov/11/popandrock2\">worked together</a> in South Ossetia, covering a government-sponsored <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7042807.stm\">Boney M concert</a> in a remote, impoverished village. It was a surreal day, and we spent most of the time laughing and joking as the disco veterans belted out hits like \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFHNOpukeEQ\">Daddy Cool</a>\" in the middle of what was then a \"frozen\" conflict zone. </p> <p>That seems a long time ago, and now the village is deserted and Klimchuk is dead \u2013 another victim of the latest brutal conflict in a country most people couldn't find on a map.</p>",
  "<p>Rapid advances in neuroscience could have a dramatic impact on national security and the way in which future wars are fought, US intelligence officials have been told.</p> <p>In a report commissioned by the Defense Intelligence Agency, leading scientists were asked to examine how a greater understanding of the brain over the next 20 years is likely to drive the development of new medicines and technologies. </p> <p>They found several areas in which progress could have a profound impact, including behaviour-altering drugs, scanners that can interpret a person's state of mind and devices capable of boosting senses such as hearing and vision.</p> <p>On the battlefield, bullets may be replaced with \"pharmacological land mines\" that release drugs to incapacitate soldiers on contact, while scanners and other electronic devices could be developed to identify suspects from their brain activity and even disrupt their ability to tell lies when questioned, the report says.</p> <p>\"The concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market. It is possible that some day there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects,\" the report states.</p> <p>The report highlights one electronic technique, called transcranial direct current stimulation, which involves using electrical pulses to interfere with the firing of neurons in the brain and has been shown to delay a person's ability to tell a lie.</p> <p>Drugs could also be used to enhance the performance of military personnel. There is already anecdotal evidence of troops using the narcolepsy drug modafinil, and ritalin, which is prescribed for attention deficit disorder, to boost their performance. Future drugs, developed to boost the cognitive faculties of people with dementia, are likely to be used in a similar way, the report adds. </p> <p>Greater understanding of the brain's workings is also expected to usher in new devices that link directly to the brain, either to allow operators to control machinery with their minds, such as flying unmanned reconnaissance drones, or to boost their natural senses. </p> <p>For example, video from a person's glasses, or audio recorded from a headset, could be processed by a computer to help search for relevant information. \"Experiments indicate that the advantages of these devices are such that human operators will be greatly enhanced for things like photo reconnaissance and so on,\" Kit Green, who chaired the report committee, said.</p> <p>The report warns that while the US and other western nations might now consider themselves at the forefront of neuroscience, that is likely to change as other countries ramp up their computing capabilities. Unless security services can monitor progress internationally, they risk \"major, even catastrophic, intelligence failures in the years ahead\", the report warns. </p> <p>\"In the intelligence community, there is an extremely small number of people who understand the science and without that it's going to be impossible to predict surprises. This is a black hole that needs to be filled with light,\" Green told the Guardian.</p> <p>The technologies will one day have applications in counter-terrorism and crime-fighting. The report says brain imaging will not improve sufficiently in the next 20 years to read peoples' intentions from afar and spot criminals before they act, but it might be good enough to help identify people at a checkpoint or counter who are afraid or anxious. </p> <p>\"We're not going to be reading minds at a distance, but that doesn't mean we can't detect gross changes in anxiety or fear, and then subsequently talk to those individuals to see what's upsetting them,\" Green said.</p> <p>The development of advanced surveillance techniques, such as cameras that can spot fearful expressions on people's faces, could lead to some inventive ways to fool them, the report adds, such as Botox injections to relax facial muscles.</p>",

  "<p>Nothing makes Russia's actions here defensible, and Putin is a thug, and Medvedev is his tool and all the rest of it. Stipulated -- believe me, with feeling.</p> <p>However, there's some background here that people should study up on. I highly recommend <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060710/cohen\">this recent Nation piece</a> by Stephen F. Cohen, that magazine's longtime Russia expert, on how several steps taken by the West and the US in recent years have been interpreted in Moscow. Very enlightening reading. </p> <p>Most striking to me is Cohen's take on the eastward expansion of NATO, which Russia saw as adumbrating or even helping to create the conditions for a new cold war. I always wondered why, back in the mid-1990s, the US and the West didn't try to set up a process to bring Russia into NATO. I understand the problems with that: Russia wasn't committed enough to democracy and free markets, and Russian's inclusion would have committed the West to defense of Russia (quite problematic during the Balkan wars, to say the least). And anyway, it's too late now, since Russia is much farther away from being a democracy now than it was then.</p> <p>But encircling Russia with NATO was a bad idea, and it, combined with the Bush administration's dumping of the ABM treaty and other moves, has certainly contributed to the tension and to Russian paranoia. I would hope an Obama administration, should it come to pass, would change this direction, but I was disappointed to see he's on record <a href=\"http://time-blog.com/real_clear_politics/2008/08/obama_nato_membership_for_geor.html\">backing Georgia's inclusion</a> in NATO.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-336540166\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Villages in Georgia were being burned and looted as Russian tanks and soldiers followed by \"irregulars\" advanced from the breakaway province of South Ossetia, eyewitnesses said today.</p> <p>\"People are fleeing, there is a mood of absolute panic. The idea there is a ceasefire is ridiculous,\" Luke Harding, the Guardian's correspondent, said.</p> <p>Earlier, witnesses reported a military convoy heading towards the Georgian capital Tbilisi, but it later turned off the road and headed back towards South Ossetia. Russia denied any advance.</p> <p>Harding, watching villages near Gori burn, said witnesses had told him Russian military, including at least 25 tanks, had moved from the Russian-controlled South Ossetia into the villages.</p> <p>\"They asked villagers to hang white flags or handkerchiefs outside their houses if they did not want to be shot, they say.\"</p> <p>The tanks had passed through the village of Rekha at about 11.20am local time. \"Behind them (say eyewitnesses) is a whole column of irregulars who locals say are Chechens, Cossacks and Ossetians.</p> <p>\"Eyewitnesses say they are looting, killing and burning. These irregulars have killed three people and set fire to villages. They have been taking away young boys and girls,\" said Harding, watching smoke rise from another village, Karaleti.</p> <p>He said he had witnessed people fleeing in the direction of Tbilisi. \"For three hours there were people fleeing in cars, I saw one with 11 people and a Lada with eight people in it.\" He had also seen people fleeing on a horse and cart and a tractor. </p> <p>Eyewitness claims could not be immediately verified.</p> <p>It appeared that Russian tanks had entered Gori, targeting military installations, some built with Nato money.</p> <p>The ministry of foreign affairs in Georgia claimed four civilian cars with murdered passengers \"were reported to have been seen in the village of Tedotsminda near Gori.\"</p> <p>US President George Bush today announced he was sending the US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, to Tbilisi to convey Washington's \"unwavering support for Georgia's democratically elected government\". He called on Russia to end all military activities and withdraw from Georgia. </p> <p>Bush said he was also sending US military aircraft to the region with humanitarian and medical supplies and hoped Russia would allow supplies to reach those who needed them. \"Russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis,\" he added. </p> <p>Russia's deputy chief of general staff, Colonel-General Anatoly Nogovitisyn, said earlier today that no tanks were in Gori. He claimed Russians went into the town to implement the truce with local officials but could find none.</p> <p>A reporter from the Associated Press also said fighters from the other separatist region of Abkhazia had moved into Georgian territory, planting their flag on a bridge over the Inguri river and saying they were laying claim to what had historically been Abkhazian territory.</p> <p>Earlier, Georgia said its troops had pulled out of Abkhazia after the Kremlin had laid down humiliating peace terms as the price for halting the Russian invasion and its four-day rout of Georgian forces.</p> <p>The ceasefire required both sides to return to positions they held before the conflict started in South Ossetia last week.</p> <p>The key demands are that the Georgian leader pledges to abjure all use of force to resolve Georgia's territorial disputes with the two breakaway pro-Russian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia; and that Georgian forces withdraw entirely from South Ossetia and are no longer part of the joint \"peacekeeping\" contingent there with Russian and local forces.</p> <p>The Russian president, Dimitry Medvedev, also insisted the populations of the two regions had to be allowed to vote on whether they wanted to join Russia, prefiguring a possible annexation that would enfeeble Georgia and leave its leader, Mikheil Saakashvili, looking crushed.</p> <p>Russian leaders claimed Georgian forces perpetrated atrocities against civilians when Saakashvili gave the go-ahead last week for the bungled attempt to recapture South Ossetia.</p> <p>The gamble triggered the onslaught which the US state department yesterday described as \"plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of Russia\".</p> <p>Georgian forces have been part of the peacekeeping force in South Ossetia for the past 15 years. But Russian leaders declared yesterday the Georgians would not return, and South Ossetia would be under Russian control.</p> <p>\"They shot their brother Russian peacekeepers, then they finished them off with bayonets, so we are not going to see them there any more,\" said Dmitri Rogozin, the Russian ambassador to Nato in Brussels.</p> <p>While Nato leaders in Brussels stressed that South Ossetia and Abkhazia were part of Georgia, Medvedev encouraged the secession of the two breakaway regions.</p> <p>\"Ossetians and Abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account, including what happened in the past few days,\" he said.</p> <p>Western officials at Nato, in the EU, in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and in Washington, while calling for an immediate ceasefire, also demanded that Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity be upheld.</p> <p>Following a meeting of Nato states yesterday, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, Nato's secretary general, accused Russia of not respecting Georgia's territorial integrity. \"Abkhazia and Ossetia, if I mention territorial integrity, are to the best of my knowledge part of Georgia.\" He added that \"Nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict\".</p>",
  "<p>A small German town was today reeling from an attack at a popular Italian ice-cream parlour in which three people were shot dead and one was seriously injured. </p> <p>Four men reportedly stormed the De Rocco ice-cream parlour in R\u00fcsselsheim south-west of Frankfurt yesterday evening and shot three people dead before fleeing down a pedestrian street.</p> <p>Two Turkish citizens, aged 49 and 28, were arrested today following a manhunt involving more than 200 police with helicopters and sniffer dogs. Police were continuing their search. </p> <p>One of the victims was a 55-year old Greek woman identified as Anna K, who ran a Greek restaurant next to the ice-cream parlour. She was caught in the crossfire after leaving the cafe as the dispute escalated, and died from internal bleeding in the arms of her husband at the scene.</p> <p>The two other victims were men of Turkish origin aged 26 and 29. The first was described by police as being one of the attackers. His 21-year-old brother was also seriously injured and under police protection in hospital last night. The second dead man was said to have been sitting at the table when the men opened fire.</p> <p>The attack has raised fears that provincial Germany is becoming a battleground for gang warfare after an incident almost exactly a year ago in which six Italians were gunned down at an Italian-run pizzeria in Duisburg, north-west of Frankfurt. It was quickly established that the Calabrian mafia, known as the 'Ndrangheta, was responsible for that shootout and had taken advantage of the relative obscurity of provincial Germany to continue a decades-old feud. The killings were the first time a mafia syndicate had carried out a revenge attack on foreign soil.</p> <p>Today police refused to rule out a mafia or organised crime connection in the R\u00fcsselsheim killings, but said the Turkish origin of the victims and attackers in the latest incident suggested the attacks were not linked. </p> <p>\"We don't know why the attack took place in the ice cream parlour,\" Roland Desch of Hessen police said.</p> <p>The brutality of the killings has shocked Germany and raised concerns that it is becoming a hub for underground economic crime.</p> <p>\"This is a very complex case,\" said Stefan M\u00fcller of the state of Hesse crime squad. He added that the killings, which involved knives as well as two guns, could have been \"honour killings\" which either had to do with a dispute between two parties, or were sparked by rivalries between two gangs. </p> <p>The police said there was evidence that a motive for the attack may have been unpaid gambling winnings and be linked to another gambling dispute three years ago. At least two of the men involved in the incident were caught up in a dispute involving knives at a Turkish community centre in R\u00fcsselsheim last Saturday to which the police were called.</p>",
  "<p>By the time the Olivier Messiaen centenary celebrations finish at the end of this year, many may be feeling that a little of his music goes a long way. This sentiment is particularly true in the case of Eclairs sur l'au-del\u00e0. The composer's final orchestral work says nothing that Messiaen didn't say elsewhere - and does so at great length. Accept this, however, along with the naivety of Messiaen's utterly distinctive palette of sonorities and huge building blocks of sound, and the effect of the piece in concert can be seductively all-encompassing, particularly when the performance is as self-assured as this one from Ilan Volkov and the BBCSSO.</p> <p>Volkov has had a sure touch with Messiaen in the past: the controlled precision of his approach keeps in check the tendency some have to go all out on the splashier aspects of the score. Eclairs may be monumental in every sense of the word, but it is as much about restraint as excess. There was real tenderness in Volkov's treatment of the quiet, still moments, which contrasted with the frenetic energy of other sections to create a sense of almost operatic drama.</p> <p>Eclairs is arguably a programme in its own right rather than half a concert, and the decision to pair it with Thomas Ad\u00e8s's Tevot seemed a little misguided. The two works have little in common except for an extremely large percussion section (which in the Usher Hall took up most of the organ gallery). The latent romanticism of Ad\u00e8s's writing would have been heard to better effect in the context of a 19th-century programme, despite the commanding performance it received here.</p>",
  "<p>\u0095 First volunteers were told to avoid the foreign media. Now police are taking a hands-on approach. British reporter John Ray of ITV News was briefly detained today as he covered a protest by Students for a Free Tibet at Beijing's Ethnic Minorities park, close to the main Olympic zone, and the Guardian's Dan Chung was among those manhandled as he photographed officers removing activists. </p> <p>Ray said police roughed him up and wrongly accused him of carrying a Tibetan flag. He was forced into a police van and driven away. An official from Beijing's public security bureau said later that police had mistaken him for a protester. Seven American demonstrators were deported today; it is thought Pema Yoko, an ethnically Tibetan woman with Japanese citizenship but brought up in the UK, was also being removed.</p> <p>\u0095 Chinese officials have denied that the \"Green Olympics\" have put pressure on water resources in and around the parched capital. Critics say that the city is pumping more and more from sources that are already over-used, including strategic reserves of deep underground supplies. </p> <p>Gao Erkun, an official with the ministry of water resources, told a news conference: \"For Beijing during the Olympic games, there is no development or exploration of deep groundwater.\" </p> <p>He denied that the government had diverted water from Hebei to Beijing for the games, despite complaints from farmers in the neighbouring province.</p> <p>\u0095 A dancer injured in a rehearsal for the opening ceremony could face a life of paralysis, Chinese media have reported. Beijing organising committee spokesman Wang Wei today confirmed that 26-year-old Liu Yan was seriously injured, but did not go further, describing it as \"a very private question\". </p> <p>The Shanghai Morning Post said Liu underwent six hours of surgery after falling from a stage at the Bird's Nest stadium last month. Liu, said to be one of China's top dancers, is thought to have been practising for a solo.</p> <p>\u0095 Tens of thousands of internet users have joined the hunt for the father of one of China's new sporting heroes. Guo Wenjun almost quit shooting after her father abandoned her to the care of her coach a decade ago, but trainer Huang Yanhua convinced her that winning gold \u2014 as she did in the women's 10 metre air pistol this week \u2014 \"could be the most effective of any missing persons notice\". </p> <p>Guo's father raised her after splitting from her mother and introduced her to shooting. But in 1999 he disappeared, saying in a note that he was going far away and asking Huang to treat her as his daughter. Guo told her coach before the Olympics: \"I'll do well in the games, and my dad will see me and be proud.\"</p> <p>\u0095 A legal activist who applied to demonstrate in designated \"protest zones\" established for the games has been detained, Human Rights Watch said today.</p> <p>The group said Ji Sizun, 58, from Fujian province, was arrested on Monday as he visited a police station to check on the status of his application. Witnesses saw several men escort him to an unmarked car and he has not been seen since.</p> <p>\"The protest application process clearly isn't about giving people greater freedom of expression, but making it easier for the police to suppress it,\" said Sophie Richardson, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch.</p> <p>The police told Reuters no one had been arrested or taken away. No protests have yet been held in the zones.</p> <p>\u0095 On Sunday, Russian and Georgian athletes embraced despite the conflict between their countries. But while an uneasy truce now prevails in South Ossetia, tempers frayed in the unlikely setting of the Olympic beach volleyball court.</p> <p>\"We were not playing against the Georgian team today,\" sniffed defeated Russia's Natalia Uryadova, pointing out that her rivals are Brazilian-born.</p> <p>\"We were playing against the Brazilian team. If they are Georgian they would certainly have been influenced [by world events], but certainly they are not.\"</p> <p>Her teammate's claim that they could not even name the Georgian president was disproved by Cristine Santanna's swift reply: \"It's Mikhail Saakashvili, and I was with his wife here two days ago in the village.\"</p> <p>She added: \"We did this for the Georgian people.\" Mrs Saakashvili, apparently a keen beach volleyball player, invited Santanna and her teammate Andrezza Chagas to form the Georgian squad.</p>",
  "<p>The BBC's new Gaelic digital television channel, seen as a possible platform for a new all-Scottish national service, is to begin broadcasting next month, the corporation confirmed today.</p> <p>BBC Alba, the Gaelic for Scotland, will launch at 9pm on September 19 and provide a dedicated Gaelic-only service on cable and satellite TV and, pending a BBC Trust decision nearer the time, on digital terrestrial TV service Freeview after analogue switch-off in 2010. </p> <p>The new channel will cost \u00a314m and has been co-funded by MG Alba, formerly known as the Gaelic Media Service, with \u00a310m, and with \u00a34m from the BBC.</p> <p>MG Alba is chaired by Alistair Morrison, a former BBC journalist and until last May's Scottish elections, the Labour MP for the Western Isles. His recent appointment caused a bitter row with the Scottish National Party because of his links to the Labour party. </p> <p>Morrison, whose brother John is also a former BBC News journalist and partner in a media and public relations firm in Glasgow, said: \"The launch of BBC Alba is a wonderful milestone for broadcasting. The most important priority for MG Alba is that viewers and listeners receive high quality television, radio and online services, and I'm delighted that we are establishing this new service through the historic collaboration between MG Alba and the BBC.\"</p> <p>The controller of BBC Scotland, Ken MacQuarrie, added: \"The launch of a new channel is always an exciting time for any broadcaster and I'm delighted that the partnership between BBC and MG Alba has resulted in this happening right here in Scotland.\"</p> <p>BBC Alba's launch will coincide with publication of the final report by the Scottish Broadcasting Commission into the state of broadcasting and new media in Scotland, which is also expected next month. </p> <p>The commission is studying proposals, pushed most heavily by the Scottish Conservative party, for a Scotland-only digital television channel as a counterweight to the perceived London bias of UK broadcasting.</p> <p>One suggested option is for English-language programming to piggyback Gaelic language output on BBC Alba, although the commission is thought to be anxious to preserve the service's control over its evening peaktime programming.</p> <p>Ted Brocklebank MSP, the Tories' Scottish culture spokesman, said: \"This is very welcome news. The Scottish Conservatives have long had an excellent record in promoting Gaelic broadcasting. Indeed it was under a Conservative government, and with the full support of the Scottish Office, that the Gaelic Broadcasting Fund was set up in the 1980s. </p> <p>\"With the Scottish Broadcasting Commission due to report in September, we are optimistic that another Scottish Conservative initiative, the proposed new Scottish Digital Channel, will be one of the recommendations. This could pave the way for 'City TV', which would at long last provide genuinely local TV coverage for Scotland.\"</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>Once again, plaintiffs who have been waiting for a payout in the Exxon Valdez lawsuit will have to continue their wait.</p> <p>The US supreme court yesterday declined to decide whether Exxon Mobil Corp should pay interest on punitive damages, which would nearly double the $507m award punishing the company for its role in an oil spill that leaked 11m gallons of crude oil into the fishing waters of Prince William Sound.</p> <p>The lawsuit, which was filed within days of the 1989 oil spill, has been slowly making its way through the country's appellate courts, winding up in front of the supreme court in late February. The high court in June cut the punitive award from $2.5bn to $507m and set a 1-to-1 ratio for punitive damages in maritime cases, based on the amount of compensatory damages awarded.</p> <p>Exxon has balked at paying interest, which lawyers for the fishermen and other plaintiffs in the case estimate would bring the company's total payout to $1bn. yesterday, the supreme court officially sent the case back to the 9th US circuit court of appeals in San Francisco to determine the interest payments and the total punitive damages.</p> <p>\"We can look at a few more years, huh?\" said Andrew Wills, a former herring fisherman who now runs an inn and bookshop in Homer. \"It would have been really simple for them to just say 'pay the interest'. I've given up the supreme court.\"</p> <p>But lawyers for the plaintiffs say it's not unusual for the supreme court to shift such a decision back to the 9th circuit. They don't see yesterday's move as a setback, said Stanford Law School professor Jeffrey Fisher, who argued the case for the plaintiffs in front of the supreme court.</p> <p>\"It is typical procedure for the supreme court to decide to decide the big legal questions and to leave it to the lower courts to do the housekeeping,\" Fisher said. \"Having said that, we're going to do everything we can to bring this to a quick and expeditious close.\"</p> <p>Lawyers for the fishermen and other plaintiffs in the case have calculated that interest will add up to about $488m, bringing the total amount that Exxon owes from the 1989 oil spill to nearly $1bn. Minus attorney's fees, they had estimated that $628m would be divided among the more than 32,000 plaintiffs in the case.</p> <p>Their calculations are based on interest accruing since 1994, when an Anchorage, Alaska, jury originally awarded $5bn in punitive damages, an amount that was cut to $2.5bn by an appeals court and then to $507m by the supreme court. Lawyers for the plaintiffs calculated the interest on the $507m, however, not on the original $5bn award.</p> <p>It would be unprecedented for the plaintiffs not to receive interest, Fisher said. They've researched similar cases in front of the 9th circuit, and they've failed to find one where interest wasn't paid out - even when punitive damages are reduced. In the cases they researched, interest was paid on the reduced amount, but going back to the original date of the judgment, Fisher said.</p> <p>Lawyers for the plaintiffs filed their motion asking the court to address the question of interest as a precautionary move, based on their reading of an obscure supreme court rule in other, similar cases. While it was an abundance of caution on their part, Fisher said, Exxon used it as an opening to file an aggressive motion seeking to avoid an interest payout.</p> <p>Exxon argued in its brief submitted to the supreme court that the amount the court decided on was \"the legally correct amount necessary to deter Exxon and others from future oil spills,\" and that there was no intent to allow millions more in interest to accrue.</p> <p>The company continues to maintain that if interest is payable, it should be from the date the supreme court determined the damages - June 25.</p> <p>\"Like everybody involved, we're anxious to have it resolved,\" said company spokesman Alan Jeffers. \"But the reality is, the supreme court has declined to rule on this motion by the plaintiffs. So we will participate in that process in a timetable mandated by the court. It's really in the ninth circuit's hands.\"</p> <p>Exxon, which posted record profits of $11.68bn last quarter, has already accounted for a potential settlement of up to $507m on its books. The company, considered the most profitable publicly traded US corporation, subtracted $290m from its second-quarter profits when they announced them at the end of July. The settlement will be tax deductible, so the company's accountants have estimated that it will have a $290m potential impact on the company's earnings. That number could go up if Exxon has to pay interest on the damages.</p>",
  "<p>Having come into these championships in the form of his life, Andy Murray<br>could reasonably have expected something better in Beijing, but not, he<br>explained, without proper preparation. \"Ideally I would have liked to<br>have got here earlier and prepared normally at the start of the tournament, not after I lost [in the singles],\" said Andy.</p> <p>When he did weigh himself, after the shock defeat to Lu Yen-Hsun, of<br>Chinese Taipei in the opening round of the singles on Monday, Murray discovered that he had lost four and a half kilos, which he put down to his failure to eat properly and keep hydrated. \"It affected my form,\" he stated simply.</p> <p>Something did, that's for sure. For not even the second explanation that Andy<br>put forward (and one not entirely agreed with by Jamie) - that they don't play<br>together often enough - would have accounted for a performance against<br>the two Frenchman, Arnaud Clement and Michael Llodra, in the second round<br>of the doubles yesterday that was so lacking in lustre, that no one watching<br>would have believed that Andy had won his first Masters tournament just<br>nine days earlier.</p> <p>The opposition was always going to be difficult. France has not had a good<br>start to the Olympics and, when they began the fifth day of the Games<br>without a single gold, one supporter suggested that they might have to<br>wait until London till they got one. Maybe it was an omen that shortly before<br>Murray stepped onto court four, they claimed their first.</p> <p>The first two games went with serve, but not before Llodra, with a<br>super-sweet backhand drive, reminded the Scots that the partnership they<br>were facing had a touch of class; Clement and Llodra were the 2007 Wimbledon doubles champions. That was the problem: usually the Olympics divides established partnerships because they come from different countries. It didn't here.</p> <p>The French soon took control of the match, breaking Jamie's service in the<br>fourth game to go 3-1 up, and enjoying a second break in the sixth game<br>when Andy imploded: a double-fault, a missed smash, 5-1 down. The French were unwavering: while Andy ran back and forth to his brother, as if trying to<br>energise his tennis by doing so, the French got on with it, clinically wrapping-up the first set 6-1.</p> <p>The crowd, about 80 per cent of which was British, kept up a continuous level of support. But court four, set in an inglorious concrete basin that wouldn't have looked out of place on the South Bank, had seats for just 200. So, the shouting never amounted to a roar.</p> <p>The second set offered one brief and final ray of hope, when the British<br>duo came close to breaking Llodra's serve in the second game to take a 2-0<br>lead. But the opportunity passed by, and in the next game Andy lost his service for a second time in the match.</p> <p>In the fifth game, a beautifully-placed Clement lob for the opening point<br>saw the hitherto restrained Frenchman whoop with delight.<br>They were chasing down their prey now. At 3-2 down, Murray had stopped<br>running back and forth to his brother. When he lost the first point of the<br>next game, he emitted one very loud shout, like a wounded stag.</p> <p>The end came quickly enough, with a row of French supporters materialising<br>from nowhere. They may be back for the doubles final on Saturday. The<br>Murrays were lamenting their loss. \"We didn't play well,\" said Andy,<br>repeating it like a mantra.</p>",
  "<p>I see that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/12/conservatives.northernrock\">John Redwood</a> is telling us that one of the ways in which his party are going to close the gap in the public finances is by having fewer big government IT projects. Oh yeah? Allow me a moment's scepticism.</p> <p>The thing is, these big IT projects aren't just dreamed up by the government. They're sold to the government, by management consultants. Sure, the government of the day and the impartial civil service will tell you that they make the policy decisions and merely commission these projects from the most efficient private sector provider, but come on, we all know that isn't true. </p> <p>When you bought that Slenderciser machine from the late night infomercial, I'm sure that at the time you felt you were making an objective decision about the cost-effectiveness of spending 10 short minutes a day doing a variety of isometric exercises versus costly gym membership and inconvenient diets. But in retrospect, as you survey the layer of dust on top of the thing in the attic, I'm sure you'll agree that basically, you got played. That's more or less how it goes down with management consultants, civil servants and big IT projects.</p> <p>Consultants are a bit like bindweed. When you've got bindweed in your garden, you don't get rid of it just by getting up one morning and saying, \"You know what? I fancy a bit less bindweed!\". Consultants are the same.</p> <p>Consultants are, if anything, a bit more difficult to be rid of. With bindweed, it is a hell of a job to eradicate, but at the end of it, your garden looks more or less how you wanted it to. With consultants, once you've pried their cuticles out of your cash drawer, booted their Savile Row backsides out the door and changed your phone number, you have to face up to the fact that your department of state now doesn't look how you wanted it to \u2013 specifically, you don't have that nice big IT project you wanted. Saving money on big IT projects means not doing the thing that you wanted the IT project for.</p> <p>Of course, that's no big philosophical problem for John Redwood \u2013 he's all in favour of the government doing a lot less. However, I wonder whether the Cameron Tory party actually realises what they are going to be able to achieve in the way of innovative policies if they're really going to foreswear big IT and management consultancy. Specifically, I wonder whether they've realised that what they're going to achieve if they hold to Redwood's self-denying ordinance is somewhere in the region of knack-all.</p> <p>Let's take as an example \u2013 not for any particular reason, but just because it happened to cross my desk because his most recent speech about it namechecked one of my co-bloggers \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=news.story.page&amp;obj_id=146038\">Michael Gove's</a> innovative, fresh, etc etc proposals for education. You probably missed them because the headlines concentrated on how he doesn't think much of Nuts magazine, but he had quite a radical rethink in mind.</p> <p>In short, the idea was: We will make schools accountable to parents by allowing parents to choose the school they want for their child. We'll give every parent the right to take the money currently allocated to their child's education and then deploy it in accordance with their priorities, not the government's. </p> <p>We'll make it easier for new providers to enter the state system, reforming planning and other laws to increase choice and diversity. Parents will be empowered to choose the school with the pedagogy, the disciplinary approach, the ethos and the philosophy they believe in. Whether it's the philosophy of Rudolph Steiner or Thomas Arnold, it will be parents who decide what's right for their children. </p> <p>The relationships between schools, teachers, parents and pupils will change \u2013 and in everyone's interest. Heads will recruit, and teachers will apply, on the basis of belief in a particular school's distinctive ethos. Schools will seek to attract, and retain, parents and pupils by proactively selling themselves on their special qualities. Instead of pursuing just one, centrally-dictated measure of quality and accountability, schools will be able to make their pitch to parents on the basis of a wider, and dare I say it, more comprehensive range of virtues.</p> <p>Gosh that sounds fantastic, catch me, I'm fainting. Now, let's get out the slide rule and work out exactly what this great new plan is going to involve, eh?</p> <p>OK, first up, when Gove says that he wants anybody who wants to be able to set up a school, he clearly doesn't mean convicted paedophiles. So the new schools' staff and owners are going to have to go through quite a rigorous criminal records check. The criminal records check infrastructure is one of those government IT projects that we know doesn't work very well, and specifically doesn't respond to demand spikes very well at all. And that's probably the simplest aspect.</p> <p>Going on, although the underlying idea is to let a thousand flowers bloom in UK education, the simple realities of the core curriculum and exam results mean that there will have to be some sort of Ofsted apparatus to ensure minimum standards. Ofsted is already more or less stretched to breaking point and there's no very obvious place from which you could get a load of qualified school inspectors to take on the extra work at short notice. So it's going to get contracted out on to one of those big government outsourcing contracts, not unlike Sats marking with ETS. Which, again, is an aspect of big government that's known fairly well not to work.</p> <p>Now we come to the money side of things. Each child is going to carry with him or her a voucher. This voucher is effectively a small business grant, which will be issued in denominations of about \u00a35,000. Small grant schemes like this are known to be a fraudster's paradise, so there will need to be some pretty heavy checking and verification of all the education vouchers. Added to that, the system will need to be pretty versatile and flexible because children have an annoying habit of changing schools in the middle of the school year, meaning (presumably) that their education vouchers will need to be pro-rated. At this point, we presumably find out that different education authorities have different numbers of days in the school year, which is the sort of annoying little detail that causes wildly disproportionate trouble when you find out about it late in the day.</p> <p>And assuming that the voucher administrative overhead all works smoothly, we get on to the radical social policy, whereby Gove suggests that the voucher scheme is going to be weighted in favour of the most disadvantaged children. So, there's going to need to be a schedule of definitions of the different bands of disadvantage, a whole cottage industry in allocating children to bands (including an initial one-off exercise which will amount to more or less a means test on every child in the country). And this exercise will have to have an appeals process, and the way of the world is such that this appeals process will end up being used way more than expected.</p> <p>Sounds like a massive administrative cock-up waiting to happen? It almost certainly is. There basically isn't any way of making big changes to the big departments without going through some sort of development hell like this \u2013 some things are big because they're complicated, some things are complicated because they're big, and the Department of Education and Skills is both.</p> <p>The thing that worries me is that Gove (and once more, I am using him here as synecdoche for more or less the whole gang of them) doesn't really seem to appreciate the magnitude of the government IT project he is proposing here. </p> <p>No doubt if you suggested to him that he was planning a consultants' bonanza he'd be appalled \u2013 getting Big Government cut down to size in education is what he wants to achieve. With the best will in the world, Michael Gove is not the kind of steely-eyed, detail-oriented, battle-hardened administrative genius who could shepherd a project like this through to completion. He's a moderately engaging opinion journalist who writes a regular column about not being able to find two socks that match. Gove versus Consultants is a fight of the century to put alongside Cats v Cream or Audley Harrison v Licence-Payers. They'll skin him.</p> <p>And this sort of thing quite clearly runs top to bottom in the shadow cabinet. Very few of them give off that air of quiet technocratic confidence, and they all have plausible-sounding schemes cribbed from American thinktanks. </p> <p>Redwood, who is one of the most experienced of the lot of them, takes a look at the grab-bag of grand schemes in front of him and reckons that his government won't be spending millions on consultants? My only advice is, encourage your teenage son or daughter to marry a junior partner at Accenture - that way you'll be safe from what the Cameroonies have got planned for your pension.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Chicago. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Anni Rossi (vocals, viola). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> There's a lot to say about Anni Rossi. She's been working with Steve Albini on her debut album proper, slated for release on 4AD in 2009. She's recorded a version of Radiohead's Creep that turns the self-loathing of the original inside out and upside down. She's loved by other artists like Electrelane and the Ting Tings, with whom she's toured Europe and the States. And she's apparently popular not just with artsy boho types, but with American heartland blue-collar construction workers, who think she's a cross between PJ Harvey and Paula Abdul. </p> <p>And yet it's hard to know how to describe her. \"Avant-folkie\" sort of comes close, as does \"neo-classical singer-songwriter with quirky voice\". Luckily, the 22-year-old from Minnesota via Los Angeles has her own neat tag for who she is and what she does: \"I'm a classical kid, turned viola-pop wunderkind\", she says. So there you have it. For further idea of what to expect from her 4AD debut EP, Afton, imagine if Bj\u00f6rk had been captured after leaving the Sugarcubes and locked in a darkened room with the viola player from the Brodksy Quartet. Rossi is that viola player.</p> <p>Classically trained from a young age, she started out as a violinist before opting for its \"lower register and larger-framed cousin\". Now she plucks the poor thing with manic glee while whooping and shrieking like a hyped-up pixie. This is music for singing round <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanna\">the old Joanna</a> - or maybe that should be Joanna Newsom? Rossi is like Newsom's kid sister. Or perhaps Devendra Banhart's brattish, precocious younger cousin. You'll either find her winningly girly and intoxicating, or irritating in her smug idiosyncratic strangeness. <br> On Machine, the opening track on Afton, she eeks and grrs to denote joy unbound while the lyrics express a general wonderment at ice, snow, the natural world, and if that doesn't merit the epithet \"Bj\u00f6rkesque\", we don't know what does. Most of Rossi's songs are sparse and spare, the spaces in the music filled by her panoply of vocal tics and imagistic imaginings. On Arctic Swing, for example, she longs to be a beekeeper's daughter in the Himalayas. Where Machine finds her \"swinging crazily like a stock exchange\", Ecology is the closest she comes to a pop song, albeit an eccentric little one (it's 1:46 short, with guitar, woodwind, percussion and a driving beat). It sees her marvelling at caterpillars, her discovery that they're \"concentric\" eliciting a series of raar!s, hah!s and shriek!s. On Venice, she alternates between long drawn-out moans and sharp ecstatic sighs before countering the classical viola runs that close the piece with a bizarre impression of a motorboat. Like we say, you're either going to love her or be filled with homicidal fury at her every gasp, wail and chirrup.</p> <p> <br><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Her singular squeak might be one shattered champagne flute too many.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> Considering how idiosyncratic she is, Rossi sounds oddly familiar.<br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Make you violently happy or angry.<br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Make you want to learn the viola.<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> The Afton EP is released by 4AD on October 20.<br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Liz Green, Florence &amp; The Machine, Mechanical Bride, Joanna Newsom. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/annirossi\">MySpace.com/annirossi</a></p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Rod Thomas</p>",
  "<p>As <strong>Yahoo</strong> just <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/13/yahoo.digitalmedia\">opened <strong>Fire Eagle</strong> to the public</a>, we thought we'd introduce another location-based service. <strong><a href=\"http://www.mapmytracks.com/\">Map My Tracks</a></strong> is well targeted and knows its core audience of sports enthusiasts intimately - so intimately, in fact, that it knows exactly where they are.</p> <p>Map My Tracks came out of beta in February this year, using GPS to help athletes and trainers track their route and performance. It's an interesting idea and already has users in 70 countries.</p> <p>The site is run by three people as a side project of <strong><a href=\"http://www.tinderhouse.com/\">Tinderhouse</a></strong> , a web design and development firm, and is based in Whitstable, Kent.</p> <p><strong>Nick Tatt</strong>, managing director of Tinderhouse, gives us the lowdown.<br></p> <p><br>Nick Tatt, managing director of Tinderhouse, parent company of Map My Tracks</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Explain your business to my Mum.<br></strong> \"Map My Tracks is the easy way to accurately track your outdoor activity (jogging, cycling, sailing) using your own mobile phone.

Map My Tracks uses a mobile phone and GPS to track your location and lets you broadcast it live on the web for friends, family or coaches who can watch your progress.\"<br></p> <p><strong>\u2022 How exactly does that work?</strong><br>\"Map My Tracks turns a mobile phone into a personal GPS tracking device. It uses a mobile phone's data connection to update your location online which in turn shows viewers where you are right now. It can be used with GPS-enabled phones or by using an external GPS receiver that is connected to a phone by Bluetooth. On top of that we provide a wealth of analytical data that lets you understand how you have performed.\"<br></p> <p><strong>\u2022 How do you make money?</strong><br>\"There are two main revenue streams: a monthly subscription service and event tracking. The subscription service is free for under one hour of tracking each month, of \u00a35.99 per month for a pro account. The event tracking service provides event or race organisers with a facility to track all the competitors in a race and broadcasts a bird's eye view of the action live over the web.\"<br></p> <p><strong>\u2022 How many users do you have now, and what's your target within 12 months?</strong><br><strong>\"After just six months we already have thousands of people using Map My Tracks in over 70 countries.\"</strong></p> <p><strong><strong>\u2022 What's your background?</strong><br></strong><strong>\"I started out in business running a design company making furniture long before the web was a reality.

  "<p>Villages in Georgia were being burned and looted as Russian tanks and soldiers followed by \"irregulars\" advanced from the breakaway province of South Ossetia, eyewitnesses said today.</p> <p>\"People are fleeing, there is a mood of absolute panic. The idea there is a ceasefire is ridiculous,\" Luke Harding, the Guardian's correspondent, said.</p> <p>Earlier, witnesses reported a military convoy heading towards the Georgian capital Tbilisi, but it later turned off the road and headed back towards South Ossetia. Russia denied any advance.</p> <p>Harding, watching villages near Gori burn, said witnesses had told him Russian military, including at least 25 tanks, had moved from the Russian-controlled South Ossetia into the villages.</p> <p>\"They asked villagers to hang white flags or handkerchiefs outside their houses if they did not want to be shot, they say.\"</p> <p>The tanks had passed through the village of Rekha at about 11.20am local time. \"Behind them (say eyewitnesses) is a whole column of irregulars who locals say are Chechens, Cossacks and Ossetians.</p> <p>\"Eyewitnesses say they are looting, killing and burning. These irregulars have killed three people and set fire to villages. They have been taking away young boys and girls,\" said Harding, watching smoke rise from another village, Karaleti.</p> <p>He said he had witnessed people fleeing in the direction of Tbilisi. \"For three hours there were people fleeing in cars, I saw one with 11 people and a Lada with eight people in it.\" He had also seen people fleeing on a horse and cart and a tractor.</p> <p>It appeared that Russian tanks had entered Gori, targeting military installations, some built with Nato money.<br>Link to this audio</p> <p>The ministry of foreign affairs in Georgia claimed four civilian cars with murdered passengers \"were reported to have been seen in the village of Tedotsminda near Gori.\"</p> <p>Russia's deputy chief of general staff, Colonel-General Anatoly Nogovitisyn, said earlier today that no tanks were in Gori. He claimed Russians went into the town to implement the truce with local officials but could find none.</p> <p>A reporter from the Associated Press also said fighters from the other separatist region of Abkhazia had moved into Georgian territory, planting their flag on a bridge over the Inguri river and saying they were laying claim to what had historically been Abkhazian territory.</p> <p>Earlier, Georgia said its troops had pulled out of Abkhazia after the Kremlin had laid down humiliating peace terms as the price for halting the Russian invasion and its four-day rout of Georgian forces.</p> <p>The ceasefire required both sides to return to positions they held before the conflict started in South Ossetia last week.</p> <p>The key demands are that the Georgian leader pledges to abjure all use of force to resolve Georgia's territorial disputes with the two breakaway pro-Russian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia; and that Georgian forces withdraw entirely from South Ossetia and are no longer part of the joint \"peacekeeping\" contingent there with Russian and local forces.</p> <p>The Russian president, Dimitry Medvedev, also insisted the populations of the two regions had to be allowed to vote on whether they wanted to join Russia, prefiguring a possible annexation that would enfeeble Georgia and leave its leader, Mikheil Saakashvili, looking crushed.</p> <p>Russian leaders claimed Georgian forces perpetrated atrocities against civilians when Saakashvili gave the go-ahead last week for the bungled attempt to recapture South Ossetia.</p> <p>The gamble triggered the onslaught which the US state department yesterday described as \"plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of Russia\".</p> <p>Georgian forces have been part of the peacekeeping force in South Ossetia for the past 15 years. But Russian leaders declared yesterday the Georgians would not return, and South Ossetia would be under Russian control.</p> <p>\"They shot their brother Russian peacekeepers, then they finished them off with bayonets, so we are not going to see them there any more,\" said Dmitri Rogozin, the Russian ambassador to Nato in Brussels.</p> <p>While Nato leaders in Brussels stressed that South Ossetia and Abkhazia were part of Georgia, Medvedev encouraged the secession of the two breakaway regions.</p> <p>\"Ossetians and Abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account, including what happened in the past few days,\" he said.</p> <p>Western officials at Nato, in the EU, in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and in Washington, while calling for an immediate ceasefire, also demanded that Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity be upheld.</p> <p>Following a meeting of Nato states yesterday, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, Nato's secretary general, accused Russia of not respecting Georgia's territorial integrity. \"Abkhazia and Ossetia, if I mention territorial integrity, are to the best of my knowledge part of Georgia.\" He added that \"Nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict\".</p>",

  "<p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/13/yahoo.digitalmedia\">Media Guardian</a> has just reported, Yahoo has launched it's long-awaited Fire Eagle location tool. According to the <a href=\"http://yhoo.client.shareholder.com/press/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=327836\">press release</a>:</p> <blockquote> \"Fire Eagle is about making everything on the Internet more useful, fun or interesting by adding the element of location,\" said Tom Coates, head of product at Yahoo! Brickhouse. \"We're here to help people take their location to the Web by giving them the ability to control how much detail about their location they want to share and which applications they want to share it with.\" </blockquote> <br> <p>The press release is worth a look for the list of services built on Fire Eagle during the private beta. These include Brightkite, Dash, Dopplr, Pownce, Spot, and Outside.in Radar. Blogging site Movable Type is also using the system, though <a href=\"http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/news-and-events/1-press-releases/2008/government-must-review-regulation-of-investigatory-powers-act.shtml\">UK government</a> is so far strangely absent.</p> <p>Fire Eagle has a \"hide me\" button so you can opt out, either temporarily or permanently.</p> <p>The report in <a href=\"http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/search/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=210003056\">Information Week</a> says:</p> <blockquote> Yahoo doesn't store old location data, said Coates. That should save Yahoo from a lot of subpoenas from those seeking to use location data in litigation.

  "<p>Call me cynical if you will, but I wasn't surprised by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/12/women.justice\">yesterday's news</a> that some rape victims have had their compensation payments reduced by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) simply because they'd had a bit to drink prior to the crime. It's not like it's the first time I've ever heard <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/life-and-society/2008/03/rape-myths-women-stump-sexual\">this particular rape myth</a>, the one that says that inebriated women are somehow partly responsible for their own rapes; indeed, it's the same tired argument that's used against those irresponsible and feckless women who choose to dress \"provocatively\" or who dare to walk about unchaperoned after dark, in fact against any woman, ever, who isn't able to prove to the world that she's led a totally blame-free and virginal life. Let's face it, if you're a woman, and you're one of the nearly 14,000 a year who's brave enough to report a sex crime committed against you, someone, somewhere, will find a reason to argue that it was all your fault: and yet people still wonder why tens of thousands more women choose not to report these assaults.</p> <p>No, the only thing that surprised me about this story was that the woman-blamer in this instance was a body that's accountable to the government for the way it spends its money, and I'd only just finished reading about how tackling rape is one of the <a href=\"http://www.equalities.gov.uk/about/ministers.htm\">top priorities for the ministers</a> for women. In light of their decision to reverse this insult and to pay the 14 women the money to which they were entitled, I'll give CICA the benefit of the doubt this time and assume that that message hadn't quite filtered its way down yet.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.equalities.gov.uk/publications/7783-TSO-ChangeWomensLives(P).pdf\">progress report (pdf)</a> issued by the ministers for women last month doesn't really tell us that much about what's being done about the endemic levels of rape and sexual violence in this country. Despite the fact that the ministers' stated priority 2 is \"Tackling Violence Against Women and Improving the Treatment of Women who Commit Crimes,\" the only real progress the document mentions in relation to tackling rape is the \u00a31m in emergency funding that was pledged in March to ensure that no more rape crisis centres would be forced to close, well, not this year at least. The report also talks about the government's commitment to increasing the numbers of sexual assault referral centres (SARCs), but as I've mentioned in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/26/acrisisforwomen\">a previous article</a> on this issue, these centres are set up to deal with victims in the immediate aftermath of an assault, and offer no services to women coping with the long term-effects of rape on their lives. Rape crisis centres on the other hand, provide support and services to any woman who has experienced rape, be it last week, last year, or indeed, 20 years ago.</p> <p>As always, there appear to be a lot of good intentions, and a lot of stated aims in the report about the ministers being committed to making things better for women, but practically speaking, it offers very little beyond the same old same old empty words and false optimism. For without a significant financial investment in Rape Crisis and other women's sector organisations there's only limited scope for improvement, and apart from this year's emergency monies, there's little sign of any future or more long-term funding. Meanwhile the stop-gap funding is coming to an end, and once more organisations providing vital services to women are left wondering how on earth they're going to manage when that money runs out.</p> <p>But at least it's not just me and a few feminist activists who are getting frustrated by the lack of progress on this issue; now even the UN have announced that they're fed up with the current state of affairs. In <a href=\"http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/CEDAW.C.GBR.CO.6.pdf\">a recent report (pdf)</a> by the Committee for the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) a number of serious government failings have been cited, including the lack of sustainable funding for women's voluntary and community organisations, specifically Rape Crisis centres. As Sheila Coates and Lee Eggleston <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/2008/07/women-violence-committee\">pointed out</a> in the New Statesman, the CEDAW Committee heavily criticised the UK for being in breach of key elements of the UN convention. The CEDAW report states for example that: </p> <blockquote> <p>The Committee is concerned about the continuing prevalence of violence against women and girls, including domestic and sexual violence, and about the low prosecution and conviction rates of sexual violence cases. The Committee remains concerned about the absence of a comprehensive national strategy and programme to combat all forms of violence against women and girls. The Committee notes with concern the lack of adequate support and services for victims, including shelters, which is compounded by the funding crisis facing non-governmental organizations working in the area of violence against women and the forced closures of a number of such organizations.</p> </blockquote> <p>It goes on to say: </p> <blockquote> <p>The Committee calls on the State party to ensure the full implementation of legislation on violence against women, as well as the prosecution and conviction of perpetrators. The Committee recommends the expansion of training activities and programmes for parliamentarians, the judiciary and public officials, particularly law enforcement personnel and health-service providers, so as that they are sensitized to all forms of violence against women and can provide adequate support to victims. It recommends the expansion of public awareness-raising campaigns on all forms of violence against women and girls. The Committee also recommends the establishment of additional counselling and other support services for victims of violence, including shelters, and requests the State party to enhance its cooperation with and support, in particular adequate and sustained funding, for non-governmental organizations working in the area of violence against women.</p> </blockquote> <p>That's right, \"adequate and sustained funding, for non-governmental organisations working in the area of violence against women\". So where's the money Harriet? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/verabaird\">Vera</a>? Anyone?</p> <p>The government has until 2011 to respond to the UN, and to explain what changes it has made in the time between now and then to <a href=\"http://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/data/files/realising_rights.pdf\">ensure it adheres (pdf)</a> more fully to the convention. The ministers for women on the other hand, have got until this time next year, when they'll no doubt be publishing yet another progress report. But what's clear from both yesterday's Guardian editorial, and the CEDAW report, is that the situation as it stands must not be allowed to continue. Women and girls deserve better than this; they deserve better than to be blamed for the crimes committed against them, they deserve better than the <a href=\"http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk//index.asp?PageID=715\">current postcode lottery</a> of inadequately funded services, and most of all they deserve justice. It looks like the ministers have a busy few years ahead.</p>",

A lot more in the case of the film we published today, showing a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/aug/13/fishing.endangeredspecies\">British trawler dumping five tonnes of perfectly good fish overboard</a>.</p> <p>The practice is legal, as the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp_en.htm\">EU</a> only sets quotas for fish landed at ports, not what is actually caught at sea. In this case, it appears the fishermen were discarding low-value small (but legal) fish in order to fill their quota with higher-value big fish.</p> <p>To many this practice is simply insane. As is the annual bun-fight in December in Brussels when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2005/dec/23/food.politics\">EU fisheries ministers set the quotas</a>. First, they carefully consider the sustainable levels proposed by the <a href=\"http://www.ices.dk/indexfla.asp\">International Council for the Exploration of the Seas</a>, Europe's premier scientific body for fisheries research, and then override them in the name of political expediency.</p> <p>But the wasteful consequences of Europe's fisheries policies, though well-known, are rather abstract to most people - it all happens a long way out at sea. And that's the power of the video. At the start, a stream of dead, silvery fish slip down a chute and into the water. It goes on. And on. Seagulls gather to snap up a free lunch. </p> <p>But this is apparently not rapid enough. So the men start dumping whole boxfuls of their catch over the side. And then another load comes up from the hold, and so on.</p> <p>There is a terrible calm and openness about the whole operation - all in a day's work, it seems.</p> <p>Will this bring home the farcical nature of the fisheries policy, or do we have to wait for a total <a href=\"http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/overfishing-surpeche/media/bk_grandbanks_e.htm\">Grand-Banks</a>-style collapse? We will watch and wait.</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday, the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz published what seemed like a significant development in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, reporting that PM Ehud Olmert had presented Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president \"with a detailed <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1010812.html\">proposal</a> for an agreement in principle on borders, refugees and security arrangements between Israel and a future Palestinian state\".</p> <p>The \"offer\" is nothing too different to what we've seen before: Israel keeps the main settlement blocs, including around Jerusalem, Gush Etzion, Maaleh Adumim, and, the Ha'aretz article suggests, Efrat and Ariel too. There is no mention of arrangements for the <a href=\"http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article9573.shtml\">Jordan valley</a>, crucial territory that Olmert has previously declared his intention to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/08/israel\">annex</a>.</p> <p>While Israel apparently keeps 7% of the West Bank, the Palestinians are \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/13/israelandthepalestinians.middleeast\">compensated</a>\" with land from the Negev desert and a road connecting the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In fact, the overall borders are by and large determined by the separation wall, which the report rightly notes has created a \"new physical reality\".</p> <p>The Palestinian state would be \"demilitarised\", the question of Jerusalem is postponed, and there is \"a detailed and complex formula for solving the refugee problem\" that does not (it would seem) include even a recognition of Israeli responsibility. But while the details are familiar, and from a Palestinian point of view, a joke, what's more interesting is the way in which the package is presented as a \"shelf agreement\".</p> <p>What that basically means is that Israel does not actually need to do anything substantive until \"the Palestinians complete a series of internal reforms and are capable of carrying out the entire agreement\". Indeed, Israel would immediately annex the illegal colonies, but the strip of desert and Gaza-West Bank connecting road would not be \"delivered\" to the Palestinians until \"the PA [Palestinian Authority] retakes control of the Gaza Strip\". </p> <p>All of which means that the proposal looks like it has been designed to never actually be implemented. Moreover, the Ha'aretz article reads at times more like a sales pitch, as the reader is assured that Olmert \"feels there is time to reach an agreement during his remaining time in office\" and is \"now awaiting a decision from the Palestinians\" \u2013 who, it was claimed, have already been given maps of the proposed borders.</p> <p>The Palestinian response was swift. Abbas spokesperson Nabil Abu Rdainah denounced the plan as an unacceptable \"waste of time\" and demonstrating a \"lack of seriousness\". Emphasising that the Palestinians will only accept a state on the 1967 boundaries, \"free of settlements\", Abu Rdainah also <a href=\"http://maannews.net/en/index.php?opr=ShowDetails&amp;ID=31249\">accused</a> Israel of trying to \"escape the idea of two states\".</p> <p>Later, veteran Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said that the report was \"<a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iA5_KA-boHhmfrxdJ9usJw8HQdzg\">baseless</a>\", mere \"'half-truths\" that Israel was using \"as a test balloon so they can blame the Palestinian Authority should the negotiations fail\". From the Gaza Strip, <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-08/12/content_9221159.htm\">Hamas</a> also reacted to the breaking story, with their spokesperson describing the proposal as \"only a media report\", which if true, was intended to encourage further PA-Hamas confrontations, by linking any agreement to Abbas \"retrieving\" Gaza.</p> <p>The Palestinian response was as fast as it was dismissive, a decision taken by people keenly aware that there can be no repeat of Israel and the US's Camp David PR triumph; the Palestinians won't (even unjustly) be able to receive the blame for peace talks collapsing this time around. </p> <p>It is in this context that the comments by <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1010210.html\">Ahmed Qureia</a> on Sunday about the \"one-state solution\" should be understood. The senior negotiator and ex-prime minister declared that if Israel continued to prevent the realisation of a Palestinian state in the Occupied Territories, \"then the Palestinian demand \u2026 [would be] one state, a binational state\". </p> <p>It is what one journalist referred to as \"<a href=\"http://www.thenational.ae/article/20080811/FOREIGN/5715175/1042/rss&amp;profile=1042\">the binational weapon</a>\", a threat, or, perhaps \"a bargaining gambit\" during a critical stage in the talks. However, it is likely to be not so much the appliance of leverage, but rather an indication that the game is up; it could even be \"prophetic\".</p> <p>Taking a step back, as senior Palestinians discuss <a href=\"http://newstatesman.com/society/2008/08/palestinian-israel-palestine\">unilateral measures</a> and shifts in strategy, and as Olmert prepares to leave office, the Ha'aretz report appears like the Israeli government's own attempt at damage limitation. The newspaper itself even cited an anonymous Israeli official who confirmed that \"there is going to be no agreement, period\" (an understanding shared by the <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1010931.html\">settlers</a>).</p> <p>Last week, Jamal Zakout, advisor to Palestinian PM, Salam Fayyad, stressed repeatedly the extent to which the two-state solution was being \"endangered\". He also said that should there be no deal in 2008, and if the peace process fails, \"This time no one can say the Palestinians are to be blamed\". Across the board then, Palestinians and Israelis are positioning themselves for the failure of the Annapolis \"peace process\", though what comes next is far more unclear.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditsuisse\">Credit Suisse</a> has received a record \u00a35.6m fine from the Financial Services Authority following a scandal in which rogue traders in its investment banking division deliberately mispriced the asset-backed securities they held.</p> <p>The fine against Credit Suisse would have been as high as \u00a38m had it not been for prompt action and cooperation by the bank once the trading scandal came to light in February. It is the largest penalty for a breach of FSA principles by a regulated firm, and the second largest fine ever handed out by the watchdog.</p> <p>The pricing inaccuracies first came to the attention of senior management in February when Credit Suisse was forced to announce a $2.65bn (\u00a31.3bn) write-down and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/feb/19/europeanbanks.creditcrunch\">suspended several traders</a>. A month later it confirmed that an internal investigation had found a small number of traders had created pricing errors in their positions through \"intentional misconduct\". It said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/mar/21/europeanbanks.creditcrunch\">disciplinary action</a> had been taken.</p> <p>The episode \u2014 which centred on securities in controversial investment structures known as collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) \u2014 was highly damaging for already fragile investor sentiment in the banking sector. </p> <p>Investors have become highly distrustful of credit risk ratings attached to complex investments such as CDOs. A meltdown in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/subprimecrisis\">US sub-prime mortgage market</a> last year prompted a flight from credit risk around the world which caught the banks off guard. </p> <p>The last 12 months have seen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/08/creditcrunch\">write-downs from global financial institutions total $270bn</a>, precipitated by this flight from risk and lingering scepticism about the thoroughness with which banks have been written down the value of assets held on their books.</p> <p>Today's fine specifically relates to supervision failures by management and to the lack of trader monitoring systems and controls.</p> <p>In a statement, Credit Suisse chief executive Brady Dougan said: \"This incident was unacceptable to me and the executive board. It does not represent the high ethical standards of Credit Suisse. Our overall control framework remains sound and we have taken actions to implement a remediation programme to address the findings of our internal review.\"</p> <p>The FSA declined to comment on whether it was disciplining the individual rogue traders identified by Credit Suisse's internal investigation. The regulator rarely confirms or denies ongoing investigations. In March the Swiss bank said: \"These employees have been terminated or have been suspended and are in the process of being disciplined under local employment law.\"</p> <p>Likely action from the FSA against the rogue trader individuals is expected to turn on a technical point \u2014 whether they were directly authorised to trade by the regulator, or whether they traded under the Credit Suisse's FSA authorisations.</p> <p>Margaret Cole, the FSA's director of enforcement, said the fine against Credit Suisse \"reflects our tougher stance on enforcement and our policy of imposing higher penalties to achieve credible deterrence.</p> <p>\"It is imperative, particularly in more challenging financial conditions, that firms have in place appropriate systems and controls to manage their risks. The [Credit Suisse] subsidiaries here failed to take appropriate steps to control the potentially high risk combination in the Structured Credit Group's holdings of exotic products, opaque valuations and high leverage. </p> <p>\"The sudden and unexpected announcement of the write-down had the potential to undermine market confidence.\"</p> <p>The only larger fine imposed by the regulator was a \u00a317m market abuse penalty relating to Shell's mis-stating of proved reserves in 2004.</p> <p>After today's fine against Credit Suisse, the next largest fine for a breach of FSA principles against a regulated firm was a \u00a34m penalty handed down to Citigroup in 2005, relating to a controversial European bonds trading strategy. The firm was also required to relinquish \u00a310m of trading profits. In 2006, Deutsche Bank was fined \u00a34m in part relating to inappropriate proprietary trading activity. It was forced to relinquish a further \u00a32.4m to cover losses it avoided during these episodes.</p>",

  "<p>The big story of the Olympics is, we are told, the battle between <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7552988.stm\">China and the United States</a> for control of the medal table; a microcosm for the struggle for political, economic and cultural hegemony in the new millennium, as the balance of power shifts from occident to orient.</p> <p>At the same time, there's another intriguing scrap going on in Beijing: the tussle between surface and reality; what we see and what actually is. Cynics might argue that the Chinese authorities have long had an interesting take on the truth, from the announcement of bumper harvests while millions starved during the great leap forwards, to today's paranoid policing of the internet. But the Olympics have seen a new kind of reality avoidance.</p> <p>First, the TV footage of the opening pyrotechnical display was revealed to be augmented by <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Beijing-Olympics-Opening-Ceremony-Faked-Firework-Footprints-Added-For-TV/Article/200808215075291?lid=ARTICLE_15075291\">computer graphics</a>; and at the same event a photogenic moppet was <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7556058.stm\">miming</a> for a less attractive singer; then we find that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/12/emptyseats\">empty seats</a> are being filled by volunteers, instructed to spread their cheers equitably between competing teams; and now comes confirmation that any <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-08/10/content_9125468.htm\">rainclouds</a> that might threaten visibility are being dispersed with rockets.</p> <p>What's intriguing, to a western mind at least, is that those responsible have been entirely upfront about their deceptions. \"Most of the audience thought it was filmed live,\" declared Gao Xialong, the creator of the \"firework footprints\" that captivated millions of TV viewers, \"so that was mission accomplished.\"</p> <p>This honest dishonesty, this brazen acknowledgment that reality can and should be tweaked in the cause of spectacle and atmosphere, is at once refreshing and alarming. Like the admission of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/11/georgebush.olympics2008\">beach volleyball</a> to the Olympic canon, it signifies the gradual but inevitable triumph of showbiz over sport, and raises difficult questions about how much more virtual wool can be pulled over the eyes of global viewers \u2013 and the extent to which they'll accept it.</p> <p>Until now, the biggest worry over the veracity of sporting achievement at the Olympics has been about the effect of drugs on performance. But in their lust for drama and spectacle, what's to stop armchair viewers buying into the digital enhancement of an event, airbrushing out gymnastic stumbles and dropped relay batons in the pursuit of athletic perfection? The <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympics/monkey/7521287.stm\">BBC's coverage</a> of the games has been abetted by the creators of Gorillaz, the pop group that doesn't exist. Why not a few similarly hyperreal athletes to liven up some of the less TV-friendly events? Following Gao's logic, it doesn't matter if punters subsequently find out that the previously unknown one-legged Belgian snatching the fencing gold was a formless concoction of ones and zeros: if they accept it at the time, well, mission accomplished.</p> <p>And this way, the Brits might win their trumpeted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/09/olympics2012\">41 medals</a> after all.</p>",
  "<p>Yahoo unveiled its location tool Fire Eagle last night, in a move it hopes will support a new generation of location-based services for the web.</p> <p>First released in a closed trial in March, Fire Eagle allows users to update and manage information about where they are, so that third-party services can connect and use that information to tailor their service.</p> <p>Users can update Fire Eagle once, and that will update their location across multiple sites they use.

  "<p>Friday saw the start of the Olympics. And the end of the trial of Martin Dinnegan's killers. So it was timely that on Friday night I met with <a href=\" http://www.timesabc.org.uk/about-us.html\">Islington's Times Boxing Club</a> and Ben Kinsella's family, plus representatives of the local council and police. </p> <p>We were looking at how sport, specifically boxing, can help give young people a positive direction. Mark Prince, who <a href=\"http://www.kiyanprince.org\">lost his son, Kiyan</a>, told us how boxing had given his own life discipline.</p> <p>Now the club wants to do even more, by building another floor to their club to fit in more activities. Their volunteer leaders are passionate about the club and the way they give young people structure and ambition. </p> <p>I spent a decade working for the Sports Council and know how sport can transform young people's lives. The national lottery has brought big money into backing our Olympic contenders, and also for the grassroots. SportEngland pledged \u00a31.1bn for community sport through their community projects capital fund in 1999; but the latest figures show that \u00a3490m has still not been spent. It's so frustrating for clubs like Times who are doing great work but seem to be missing out on the money. </p> <p>Investing in sport fits well with the <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/news/liberal-democrats-outline-youth-crime-proposals.14915.html\">Lib Dem approach to tackling youth crime</a>; providing diversionary activities such as sport to stop young people getting sucked into crime, with restorative justice for those who do. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Labour government spends 11 times more on locking up our young people than it does on backing projects to stop them getting involved in crime in the first place. </p> <p><strong>Sport is supposed to have taken the place of war between democracies</strong>. So where does that leave Russia and Georgia? </p> <p>A century ago the modern Olympics were reborn in London. Ninety years ago, the liberal US president Woodrow Wilson outlined his 14 points for peace in Europe, calling for the different nationalities to have their own states, protected by international agreement. </p> <p>The Wilson doctrine was based on the on the principle of \"justice to all peoples and nationalities, and their right to live on equal terms of liberty and safety with one another, whether they be strong or weak\". </p> <p>Sending independent peace-keepers to South Ossetia now may be the best way to secure all our liberty and safety for the future.</p> <p>Back in Beijing, as I write, the medal table gives Russia 11 medals to Georgia's 1. For shooting. </p> <p>If sport takes the place of war between democracies, then elections take place of civil war within them. Despite the criminal behaviour from <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7006231.stm\">Walthamstow</a> and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/conservative/2504624/Ex-Tory-candidate-faces-jail-for-harassing-Lib-Dem-rivals.html\">Watford</a>, most politicians don't fight dirty. They genuinely want to make a difference. And so do the voters. </p> <p>Here in Islington, the voter registration forms are hitting the doormats, and people are looking ahead to their next chance to vote. Voter turnout rises in marginal seats; it makes sense that people vote when their vote makes a difference. And with Islington South one of the five most marginal Labour/Lib Dem seats, there's every reason for people to register to vote here. </p> <p>We were out canvassing on Monday night. As ever, the diversity of our supporters impresses me: the business studies student looking forward to voting for the first time; the housing activist training to be a mental health counsellor; the retired academics disillusioned with Labour; the building site supervisor who voted for Boris, but is backing me for Westminster. </p> <p>Also on Monday I visited Essex Road post office that we saved from closure earlier this year. Instead of closure, the Post Office found a franchisee, and Monday was their first day under the new management. </p> <p>Despite the rain, there were smiles all round from staff and the customers. One woman was there with her disabled husband. She told me, \"When you saved the post office, you saved my life.\" Even before the election comes, we've made a difference.</p>",
  "<p><br>New writing is not having the desired effect ... An audience, asleep. Photograph: Haydn West / PA</p> <p>The Fringe has been up and running for more than a week now, and I've been watching shows pretty much back-to-back, but I'm still waiting for it to happen: I have yet to stumble on a new play by an unknown writer that makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up because I know I'm in the presence of the real deal.</p> <p>In other respects, Edinburgh 2008 hasn't been a disappointment. Having spent far too many hours watching slipshod verbatim plays this year, Motherland and Deep Cut - both devastatingly effective - have restored my faith in documentary theatre. There's plenty of dreamy visual theatre around (I adored <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/08/edinburgh.review.polaris?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=stage\">Polaris</a> and The Idiot Colony), and no shortage of excellent plays by established playwrights to chose from (Pornography and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/aug/04/theatre.edinburghfestival\">The New Electric Ballroom</a>, to name just two). But the stuff by so-called \"emerging\" playwrights I've caught so far has left me in a frostbitten mood, making me jittery about the state of new writing.</p> <p>I still remember the thrill of finding <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/aug/18/theatre.edinburghfestival2005\">Enola</a>, Al Smith's assured debut play. And last year a graceful production of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/aug/06/theatre.edinburghfestival20075\">Declan Feenan's first play, Limbo</a> impressed me. Smith, now a Fringe veteran, is back again with The Bird and the Bee, which I have high hopes for. Feenan's follow-up, Lough/Rain, co-written with Clara Brennan, is more admirable for its promise than its success. A slight and rather forlorn play, it's a contemplative picture of a couple whose relationship has changed forever in the aftermath of a serious accident. The production is staged with great gentleness by Dan Sherer, and the actors (Jot Davies and Kate Donmall) capture the frustration and sad yearning of the characters, but the writing isn't as delicate and sharp as it could be.</p> <p>If I can, I'm going to check out Steve Walters' Out of Your Knowledge, and I'm excited about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/12/edinburghfestival.festivals1\">The Exquisite Corpse</a>, put together by a group of up-and-coming Welsh writers. But much of the new writing I'm seeing is either embarrassing or so determinedly small-scale that it flirts with innocuousness. Where, oh where are all the young playwrights hiding out?

  "<p>When Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Qureia (Abu Ala) <a href=\"http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1010210.html\">announced</a> last Sunday that the Palestinians might demand \"one state, a binational state\" if the current negotiations with Israel failed to produce satisfactory results soon, some observers reportedly commented that this statement could signal \"a significant change of heart.\" These observers probably have a short memory, because Qureia made a similar announcement in <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3381493.stm\">January 2004</a>, when he was Palestinian prime minister.</p> <p>Back then, Qureia's statement attracted much <a href=\"http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2004/01/wwwh40116.htm\">media attention</a>, and particularly the Israeli press highlighted the controversial nature of his remarks: Ha'aretz compiled a special <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=383879\">report</a> on the question \"Is the two-state solution in danger?\" and the Israeli-Palestinian forum Bitterlemons devoted an <a href=\"http://www.bitterlemons.org/previous/bl190104ed3.html\">issue</a> to \"Abu Ala's remark about a one state solution\". </p> <p>Inevitably, the vast majority of Jewish Israelis will view any talk about a one-state solution as a threat \u2013 even as an existential threat, because such a \"solution\" obviously means the end of Israel as a Jewish state. There is no reason to think that Qureia is not aware of that. When he brought up the possibility of renewed demands for \"one state, a binational state\" last Sunday, he indicated that the Palestinians would choose this option if Israel refused to withdraw to the <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/borders.html\">1967 borders</a>. </p> <p>However, in the run-up to the Annapolis meeting last fall, Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas had explicitly <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/911440.html\">stated</a> that the Palestinians were open to border adjustments as long as they would end up with an equivalent of the \"6,205 square kilometres\" of territory that make up the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. <br> But a new Israeli <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1010812.html\">proposal</a> that goes a long way to meet this demand has now been rejected by the Palestinians as a \"waste of time\". A spokesman of Abbas was quoted as saying:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Israeli proposal is not acceptable \u2026 The Palestinian side will only accept a Palestinian state with territorial continuity, with holy Jerusalem as its capital, without settlements, and on the June 4, 1967 boundaries.</p> </blockquote> <p>The rejected Israeli proposal envisaged that Israel would return to the Palestinians 93% of the West Bank, and all of the Gaza Strip, when the Palestinian Authority (PA) regains control there. In exchange for West Bank land that Israel would keep, the Palestinians would be compensated with a 5.5% land swap that would add territory to the Gaza Strip. In addition, there would be arrangements to allow for a passage between Gaza and the West Bank that would connect the two parts of the Palestinian state \u2013 a connection that did not exist before 1967 and that Palestinians would be able to use without undergoing any security checks. Obviously Israel has no reason to provide this passage for free and therefore views it as compensating for the remaining 1.5% of territory. </p> <p>Given the prominent place that is usually assigned to the demand of \"viability\" for a Palestinian state, the dismissal of this proposal is hard to justify. While there is little about the 1967 borders that would make a Palestinian state particularly viable, adding territory to the terribly overcrowded Gaza strip is clearly an excellent option \u2013 all the more so since Gaza obviously has enormous economic potential as the Palestinian state's outlet to the sea. The case for expanding the territory of Gaza is indeed not difficult to make, even though one particularly interesting <a href=\"http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/mesh/2008/01/gaza_into_egypt/\">proposal</a> that envisages a more substantial enlargement would also require Egyptian participation in a land swap.</p> <p>Instead of dismissing the new Israeli proposal as a \"waste of time\" and threatening Israel with the prospect of a binational state, the Palestinians might be better off rethinking their insistence on turning back the clock to 1967. There is plainly little merit to the notion that a Palestinian state will become viable simply because its borders correspond to the ones that existed before the six-day war between Israel, the Jordanian-ruled West Bank and the Egyptian-controlled Gaza Strip. The demand for \"6,205 square kilometres\" of territory that has been raised by president Abbas is fair and square, and the current Israeli proposal not only comes very close to fulfilling this demand, but also offers a forward-looking way that would allow the Palestinians to better develop their most densely-populated piece of territory.</p>",
  "<p><br>Brendan Benson and Jack White of the Raconteurs ... more hooks than a fishing rod sandwich. Photograph: Graham Trott/Rex</p> <p>Debate continues to rage as to whether <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/music/2008/07/school_of_rock_guitar_solos.html\">the guitar solo</a> is a vestigial organ waiting to be gently removed from pop's lexicon with a scalpel, but surely the riff is sacred? The best riffs, like the White Stripes' Seven Nation Army, can become the entire song and lay waste to our fussing over the finer points of structure.</p> <p>A riff is usually defined as a short, repeated musical (melodic or rhythmic) idea, similar to the term ostinato in classical music. Although most often associated with jazz and rock, riffs inform different styles from Prince's Sign O' the Times (surely an inspiration for the sparse R&amp;B of Missy Elliott and the Neptunes?) to the early synth-pop of Depeche Mode's Just Can't Get Enough. So, in such a wide field, what do great riffs have in common?</p> <p><strong>Silence</strong></p> <p>Don't be afraid to leave some space for the music to breathe. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtqy4DTHGqg\">Black Sabbath's War Pigs</a> leaves a huge gaping hole of two bars filled only with the hi-hat ticking away in the verses before Ozzy comes in. Then in the chorus this space is filled with pounding drum solos and the second half of the riff, which has remained absent until now. Back in Black's awe-inspiringly simple three-chord riff achieves similar crunching power through judicious use of silence. I'm not sure if this would be as effective however without the guitar licks at the end of each riff, which brings us to ...</p> <p><strong>Rhythm</strong></p> <p>There are at least two rhythmic factors that many genius riffs share:</p> <p><strong>1. Syncopation:</strong> Syncopation is when an accent is placed upon a weak beat or in-between the beats of the bar. In <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e-vgQSqNtA\">Van Halen's Jump</a>, only three notes from the keyboard riff land on any beat of the bar. Beyond this, there are two specific ways in which syncopation can be used to boost a riff. Firstly, by pushing the first beat of each bar. Metallica's Enter Sandman, Michael Jackson's Beat It and Judas Priest's Electric Eye all place the first note of the riff in-between beats four and one, which has the effect of driving the music forward. Secondly, to begin the rhythm on the beat, but then shift it to the offbeat. This can enliven even the most stodgy meat-and-potato riffs (stand up Smoke on the Water), as well as providing with us some of history's most swinging motifs with the Stones' Brown Sugar, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8_fuoypsik&amp;feature=related\">NERD's Lapdance</a> and Judas Priest's Breaking the Law which all begin on the beat and then go off track.</p> <p><strong>2. Swing:</strong> The use of a dotted, swung or triplet rhythm to give the riff a bounce. Deep Purple's Black Night is an obviously swung rhythm in the guitar riff, but the swing can be as much to do with the drummer. Thrash metal isn't a genre one would normally associate with swing but Slayer's Dave Lombardo manages to add considerable groove to songs like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWINa1IOU1I\">Blood Red</a>, as did Bill Ward in Black Sabbath.</p> <p><strong>Melody</strong></p> <p>The staple of the rock riff is the power chord. This is just the root note and fifth (with optional octave, played with distortion a la Back in Black). However, the more melodic riffs also have some common ground.</p> <p><strong>1. Blues scale</strong> (most commonly root, minor 3rd, perfect 4th, augmented 4th/diminished 5th, perfect 5th, minor 7th) If you want your riff to have a cock-rock swagger reminiscent of Led Zeppelin then base it on the blues scale. For further study, listen to the aforementioned <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9i2fqxSjTI\">Black Dog</a> (blues scale in A) or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqb5EcU65IQ\">Whitesnake's Still of the Night</a> (in F#).</p> <p><strong>2. Getting more metal</strong> If you want your rock a little less cock and more shock, then you need to introduce some extra measures. For the classic twin-guitar metal sound you need to take your riff and shift it up or down to harmonise it in thirds. Iron Maiden perfected and pioneered this after nicking the idea from Judas Priest and Thin Lizzy. The perfect example is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EJ4NlyAZ2Q\">Iron Maiden's Iron Maiden</a>. Bring in one guitar and then introduce the other a few bars later.</p> <p><strong>3. Serious evil</strong> Surely the success of Jaws introduced a generation of guitarists to the power of the semitone? Using the semitone from the tonic instead of the tone will introduce a sinister note, but if you want to get really nasty it is the tritone you'll need. Black Sabbath practically invented proper doomy, satanic metal on the eponymous <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BkhtJM8CqE\">Black Sabbath</a> using a riff of three notes, employing only the octave and the tritone. The tritone is a augmented 4th/diminished 5th, which has no place in the natural harmonic series and has been associated with evil for hundreds of years, and was termed the Devil's Interval.</p> <p>However, perhaps the most evil riff in history contains none of these elements. Its evil is manifested in a different way as a baby-sick green, anaemic aural assault. And the worst insult is that it's played by a great guitarist. Slash, what were you thinking when you played the riff to Michael Jackson's Black or White? Like Hanson trying to play Prince - no, no and no again.</p> <p>In today's pop climate, the riff is out there and alive, being nurtured by everyone from Black Mountain to the Raconteurs. So let's hear what you think are the best and worst riffs of all time ...</p>",
  "<p>The longlist for the second Northern Art prize has been announced, in the first of a carefully choreographed list of events counting down to the award ceremony in January 2009. The prize is only in its second year, but organisers have kept up their initial, chippy \"northern Turner prize\" promotion by engaging a who's who of artists and curators from across the three northern regions.</p> <p>The prize has crucially managed to maintain its monetary value as well as decent cultural prestige for a newcomer. Developers may be backing away from lofts and skyscrapers all over the north, but sponsors Logistik and Arup have loyally kept to the level of last year's \u00a316,500 first prize, plus \u00a31,500 each for three runners-up.</p> <p>There are 24 contenders this time, all chosen by three panels in the north-west, the north-east and Yorkshire. This isn't a write-in, \"pick me\" competition; artists must be invited to take part. The only crucial condition is an anti-train-to-London one, especially in the context of today's provocative Policy Exchange report suggesting that Liverpool, Sunderland and other northern cities effectively close down and send their populations south. To be eligible, artists must be working in one of the three government regions that compose the modern north.</p> <p>The prize's inaugural winners were Karen Guthrie and Nina Pope, whose exhibit was partly edible (pickled onions from the Lake District). They appeared at the awards ceremony in Leeds art gallery earlier this year in their trademark matching suits. </p> <p>The 24 artists on this year's longlist are as follows:</p> <p><strong>North-west</strong></p> <p>Simon Blackmore, Suki Chan, Nick Crowe, Ian Rawlinson and Maeve Rendle represent Manchester. Jacqueline Passmore, Paul Rooney and Imogen Stidworthy represent Liverpool. Maxine Bristow draws on her family's textile background in Bolton, the one choice from outside the big conurbations.</p> <p><strong>North-east</strong></p> <p>Newcastle naturally dominates, thanks to a crammed timetable of European Capital of Culture events despite being pipped for the actual title by Liverpool. Catherine Bertola, Graham Dolphin, Peter J Evans and Brigitte Jurack are all based in the city. The other nominees, Fiona Crisp and Richard Forster, are from Hexham and Saltburn \u2013 an inspirational setting with its pier, cliff lift and seals out to sea. Finally, Stefan Gec makes the longlist, although he has migrated to Huddersfield.</p> <p><strong>Yorkshire</strong></p> <p>Leeds doesn't comes top as you might expect, and has only two contenders in the list: Clare Charnley and the partnership of Bryan and Laura Davies. Sheffield has the most contenders with Matthew Harrison, Esther Johnson, Katy Woods and Conroy &amp; Sanderson, while Hull has Sabine Bieli and Bradford \u2013 the nurturing ground of David Hockney among others \u2013 has Penny Klepuszewska. Wakefield, whose Martin Creed won the Turner prize and presented the inaugural Northern art prize last January, doesn't make the list this time.</p> <p>The field will be whittled down by an all-woman panel \u2013 a touch of Turner prize marketing flair, although the Northern has made a name for equal shares from the start. Iwona Blazwick, director of the Whitechapel art gallery, is allowed a London take on the longlist, sitting along with writer and critic Louisa Buck, artist Georgina Starr and collector Anita Zabludowicz.</p> <p>The judges must agree upon a shortlist of four by September 9 and the rival works go head to head in an exhibition at Leeds art gallery from November 21 until the awards ceremony on January 15. This is the second year Leeds has taken the spotlight, largely because the city council started the prize in collaboration with Logistik. Next year might see a change of venue.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Karen Guthrie and Nina Pope have spurred on this year's competitors, describing how last year's victory has been a fillip for their work. Largely confined to film in recent years, the task of preparing a physical exhibit for the prize has regenerated the pair's gallery work.</p> <p>They said: \"The Northern was an unexpected opportunity to bring together a lot of work we had done in the last few years into one show, and just doing that was a satisfying experience that wouldn't have happened otherwise.</p> <p>\"Let's hope that the prize can continue to profile and value work that takes place beyond the commercial gallery sector and the mainstream, and just happens to be happening in the north too. This approach can keep it distinct from the other major art prizes.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.northernartprize.org.uk\">www.northernartprize.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown faces the prospect of another critical byelection following the death today of <a href=\" http://politics.theguardian.com/person/0,,-6335,00.html\">John MacDougall</a>, the Labour MP for <a href=\" http://politics.theguardian.com/hoc/constituency/0,,-800,00.html\">Glenrothes</a>.</p> <p>MacDougall, 60, who had been fighting cancer, died early this morning at the Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy, Fife.</p> <p>Given Labour's standing in the polls, MacDougall's death, which had been anticipated at Westminster for some time, means that <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> faces the likelihood of another humiliating defeat in what was previously a Labour stronghold.</p> <p>MacDougall, who had a low profile in the Commons, had a majority of 10,664 at the last election in his constituency, which is next to Brown's Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath seat.</p> <p>The <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/snp\">Scottish National party</a>, who were second in Glenrothes in 2005, would need a 14.5% swing to win. At the <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/glasgoweast\">Glasgow East byelection</a> last month, the SNP overturned a <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> majority of more than 13,000 with a 22% swing.</p> <p>Brown has had a dismal record in byelections this year. As well as losing Glasgow East to the SNP, Labour was also defeated by the Tories in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/crewebyelection08\">Crewe and Nantwich</a>, which Labour had won in the 2005 general election with a majority of more than 7,000. Labour also endured the embarrassment of coming fifth in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/henley\">Henley byelection</a>.</p> <p>Following the death of MacDougall, Labour has a working majority in the Commons of 62. Although losing Glenrothes would not affect Brown's ability to get legislation through parliament, byelection defeats can be deeply demoralising for MPs, and an SNP victory in Glenrothes would embolden those in the party campaigning for Brown to be replaced as leader.</p> <p>The SNP's prospects will be boosted by the knowledge that last year, in the Scottish parliament elections, the SNP beat Labour to win Central Fife, a Holyrood seat that covers the same area as the Glenrothes constituency.</p> <p>MacDougall, a former shipyard boilermaker and union official, entered parliament as MP for Central Fife in 2001. In 2005, after boundary changes, he was re-elected for a new constituency, Glenrothes.</p> <p>He had been suffering from mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer often associated with exposure to asbestos.</p> <p>A Labour party spokesman said: \"All our thoughts are with his family at this time.\"</p> <p>MacDougall was a close friend and political ally of the prime minister. Brown visited MacDougall in hospital on Monday, and spent time chatting to him. </p> <p>In a statement today, the prime minister said he had lost a \"good personal friend\" who was a \"true servant of the people\". </p> <p>He said: \"John MacDougall gave more than 30 years of distinguished public service to Fife - as a councillor, leader of the Fife council, convenor of Fife council and then member of parliament for Central Fife and he will be remembered as a true servant of the people. </p> <p>\"A very popular, diligent local member of parliament, he served Fife with great distinction in all the roles he played. </p> <p>\"In Fife he pioneered free travel for the elderly, led Scotland and Britain with nursery education for three and four year olds; was successful in pressing for new jobs and investment to replace thousands of jobs lost in mining and at Rosyth naval base, and was well known for his support for all local causes.\"</p> <p>The last byelection fought in Fife, in February 2006, saw the Liberal Democrats seize power in a strong Labour seat. </p> <p>MacDougall, who underwent surgery at Guy's Hospital in London last year to try to treat his cancer, was elected to Fife Regional Council in 1982. </p> <p>He later became the leader of the council and also served as the director of Glenrothes Development Corporation and Fife Enterprise before being elected to the House of Commons. </p> <p>He is survived by his mother Barbara, his wife Cathy and two grown-up children, Scott and Julie. </p> <p>Helen Eadie, the Labour MSP for Dunfermline East, paid tribute to MacDougall. </p> <p>She said: \"It's a very sad loss and to learn of that this morning makes me deeply saddened for John's family. </p> <p>\"His death means the loss of a good friend and a good colleague, and it is very upsetting for all of us here in Fife that we have lost someone who has dedicated all of his adult life to serving the Labour party.\" </p> <p>Eadie had known MacDougall since 1986, when she served with him on the local council, where she was the deputy leader and he was the leader. </p> <p>She went on: \"He was someone who I grew to both like and admire over the years, because he was so committed to what he was doing.\" </p> <p>And she added: \"John had above all a caring attitude, but he also had a very good sense of humour and that sense of humour always helped to cut through many difficult political situations. </p> <p>\"I always admire people who have got the ability for humour, and John certainly did have that in abundance.\" </p> <p>She described him as a dedicated and caring politician, whose door was always open to people. </p> <p>\"If he could possibly be helpful, he would,\" Eadie said.</p>",
  "<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Obama-Nation-Jerome-R-Corsi/dp/1416598065\">scathing new biography</a> of Barack Obama that its publisher describes as \"meticulously researched and documented\", Jerome Corsi, the man who launched the original <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiftboating\">Swift Boat attack</a> on John Kerry, offers a searing take on Obama's background that's only slightly undermined by the fact that he appears to have made large amounts of it up, in his brain. As <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/us/politics/13book.html\">this</a> fact-checking piece notes, Corsi claims Obama has \"yet to answer\" whether he \"stopped using marijuana and cocaine completely in college, or whether his drug usage extended to his law school days or beyond,\" but actually he's done so twice. Then there's the mysterious case of how Obama <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/items/200803170005\">attended a sermon by Jeremiah Wright as late as 2007</a>, even though he actually didn't, and was in Florida at the time he was alleged to be there. Oh, and the thing about his secret half-sister, who for some reason, presumably a nefarious one, he doesn't mention at all in his memoir. Except for the part where he -- you know -- mentions her. Plenty more <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/items/200808040005?f=h_top\">here</a>.</p> <p>In other Reverend Wright news: the aforementioned fiery pastor is not, after all, going to launch an explosive book timed to destroy Obama's candidacy.

  "<p>A siege involving a man holding a six-year-old girl prisoner entered its third day today.</p> <p>Firearms officers continued to surround a house in the North Yorkshire resort of Scarborough, where the man has barricaded himself in.</p> <p>Police were called to the property, in Herdborough Road, on Monday night in response to reports of a domestic disturbance. It was reported that the man telephoned a TV station claiming to have stabbed the girl's mother.</p> <p>Police were unable to confirm that the man, who it is thought is aged in his 30s, was armed with a knife. Police negotiators were trying to encourage the man to surrender.</p> <p>Last night, the man could be heard shouting to police officers in the garden. At one point, he was heard to say: \"I'm going to die tonight.\"</p> <p>A police spokesman said: \"Owing to a belief that there was a potential threat to life, the firearms support unit was called to assist with the control of the incident.

  "<p>Georgia claimed Russia was violating the ceasefire in the Caucasus today, saying Moscow had sent tanks from the breakaway province of South Ossetia into the Georgian town of Gori.</p> <p> \"There were about 50 tanks and armoured vehicles,\" said the Georgian national security council secretary, Kakha Lomaia.</p> <p>The Russian military denied any advance, saying \"there are no Russian peacekeeping units or forces supporting them,\" Reuters news agency reported.</p> <p>But theguardian.com's correspondent Luke Harding, about three miles from the town, said it appeared that Russian tanks had entered Gori, targeting military installations, some built with Nato money.</p> <p>The tensions followed Georgia's announcement that its troops had pulled out of the separatist region of Abkhazia today.</p> <p>Earlier, the ceasefire appeared to be holding after the Kremlin laid down humiliating peace terms as the price for halting the Russian invasion and its four-day rout of Georgian forces.</p> <p>The ceasefire requires both sides to return to positions they held before the conflict started in South Ossetia last week.</p> <p>Faced with strong western denunciation, President Dmitry Medvedev of Russia called a halt to the Russian offensive yesterday and negotiated terms for a truce and a broader settlement with President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who, as chair of the European Union, rushed to the region to try to strike a deal on a ceasefire.</p> <p>Early this morning in Tbilisi, Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili, signalled his partial assent to the terms, announcing with Sarkozy that he accepted the ceasefire. But Saakashvili raised questions about a continuing Russian military presence in Georgia and the prospects for any durable settlement looked uncertain.</p> <p>\"We do not yet have a peace deal, we have a provisional cessation of hostilities; but this is significant progress,\" Sarkozy said after talks with Medvedev in Moscow and before taking the terms to Tbilisi. This morning, Sarkozy predicted Saakashvili would accept Russian terms on the broader settlement.</p> <p>As EU foreign ministers prepared to meet to discuss the crisis today, foreign secretary David Miliband suggested \"there is merit\" at seeking an \"international presence\" in the area, possibly through the UN or the Organisation for Security and Co-Operation in Europe.</p> <p>France appears to favour sending EU monitors. Its foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, told reporters: \"The idea of having monitors \u2013 what you call peacekeeping troops, I wouldn't call them like that \u2013 but European controllers, monitors, facilitators, yes, yes and yes. That is how Europe should be on the ground.\"</p> <p>The former Georgian president Eduard Shevardnadze was today quoted as saying Georgia made a \"grave mistake\" in advancing into South Ossetia.</p> <p>In an interview with German newspaper Bild he said: \"We have a tradition, that in times of crisis, the opposition stands united behind the president and does not attack him. But Georgia should not have advanced into Tskhinvali (South Ossetia's capital) in so unprepared a way. That was a grave error.\"</p> <p>Medvedev branded Saakashvili a \"lunatic\" as he outlined tough terms to the French leader, in effect demanding Georgian capitulation to vastly superior Russian forces.</p> <p>\"The difference between lunatics and other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them,\" Medvedev said. \"So you have to use surgery.\"</p> <p>The key demands are that the Georgian leader pledges, in an agreement that is signed and legally binding, to abjure all use of force to resolve Georgia's territorial disputes with the two breakaway pro-Russian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia; and that Georgian forces withdraw entirely from South Ossetia and are no longer part of the joint \"peacekeeping\" contingent there with Russian and local forces.</p> <p>Medvedev also insisted the populations of the two regions had to be allowed to vote on whether they wanted to join Russia, prefiguring a possible annexation that would enfeeble Georgia and leave Saakashvili looking crushed.</p> <p>If he balked at the terms, said Sergei Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister: \"We will be forced to take other measures to prevent any repetition of the situation that emerged because of the outrageous Georgian aggression.\"</p> <p>Russian leaders consistently emphasise that Georgian forces perpetrated atrocities against civilians when Saakashvili gave the go-ahead last week for the bungled attempt to recapture South Ossetia.</p> <p>The gamble triggered the onslaught which the US state department yesterday described as \"plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of Russia\".</p> <p>Georgian forces have been part of the peacekeeping force in South Ossetia for the past 15 years. But Russian leaders declared yesterday the Georgians would not return, and South Ossetia would be under Russian control.</p> <p>\"They shot their brother Russian peacekeepers, then they finished them off with bayonets, so we are not going to see them there any more,\" said Dmitri Rogozin, the Russian ambassador to Nato in Brussels.</p> <p>Medvedev spoke by phone with the EU foreign policy chief, Javier Solana and told him \"there are a few things that need to be discussed to get a full ceasefire,\" said a European official.</p> <p>\"The Russians are saying that they will never again accept Georgians in any form in South Ossetia. They see them as a Trojan horse that started the attacks last week.\"</p> <p>While Nato leaders in Brussels stressed that South Ossetia and Abkhazia were part of Georgia, Medvedev encouraged the secession of the two breakaway regions.</p> <p>\"Ossetians and Abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account, including what happened in the past few days,\" he said.</p> <p>Western officials at Nato, in the EU, in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and in Washington, while calling for an immediate ceasefire, also demanded that Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity be upheld.</p> <p>Following a meeting of Nato states yesterday, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, Nato's secretary general, accused Russia of not respecting Georgia's territorial integrity. \"Abkhazia and Ossetia, if I mention territorial integrity, are to the best of my knowledge part of Georgia.\" He added that \"Nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict\".</p> <p>For months, said European officials, Saakashvili had rejected pressure to commit to forgoing the use of force. But Lavrov said the Georgian army would have to be returned to bases, and that any peace deal would \"require the signing of a legally-binding treaty on the non-use of force.\"</p> <p>The Russians have also agreed to withdraw their troops from Georgia proper and return their \"peacekeeping\" contingent to positions held before the fighting. But until monitoring of the proposed ceasefire was up and running, the Russians reserved the right to take unspecified \"additional security measures\" in Georgia.</p> <p>While thousands rallied in support of Saakashvili yesterday outside the parliament in Tbilisi, there was a growing sense among many Georgians that his decision to attack had been a disastrous blunder - with Russia's overwhelming response both predictable and highly costly.</p> <p>\"Why are people waving flags? It's not as if we won,\" Lasha Darkveldze, 23, said as supporters thronged the centre of Tbilisi and marched on its freedom square. \"Saakashvili should now resign.\"</p> <p>\"We hope he is going to disappear from Georgia,\" Bacha Janashia, 24, a student, said. \"I wonder why he did it. He has only 10,000 soldiers and he takes on Russia.\"</p> <p>If the Russian terms are demeaning, Saakashvili's bargaining position is extremely weak given the virtual disintegration of his armed forces. Abandoned tanks litter the road between Tbilisi and Gori - dumped following Russia's swift advance deep into Georgia on Monday.</p>",
  "<p>Like its precursor, the Great Wall of China, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/audio/2008/aug/05/tech.weekly.podcast\">Great Firewall</a> was constructed to guard China from waves of foreign influence and information intrusion. With the world's spotlight on China and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/censorship\">widespread criticism</a> of its repressive actions, one should not forget that the knowledge and technology used to create the world's most prominent Big Brother society was designed in the west, often by the very same corporations whose advertisements on TV take up the time between the relay race and the javelin competition. </p> <p>Much more than your standard internet filtering gateway, the Great Firewall comprises an administrative collaboration of seven government ministries, unrestricted access to numerous public record databases, closed circuit television footage with built-in facial recognition systems, as well as the more well-known information surveillance and censorship technology. Software and hardware purchased from around the world continue to tighten the screws of a digital information society. Network control and optimisation, intrusion detection and other security features promised in the product brochures of western IT firms are put to use against the rights to privacy and freedom of an entire populace. This is a brief survey of the surveillance scene:</p> <blockquote> <p>A recent (non-intrusive) scan through the website of the <a href=\"www.mps.gov.cn\">Chinese Ministry of Public Security</a> revealed a number of documents listing an inventory of various security technologies. One spreadsheet details software and hardware implemented for network surveillance, packet scanning and user detection. A closer inspection reveals that the Chinese internet infrastructure employs a huge array of security products, procured from companies all around the world. An example of four tools, chosen from the several hundred found in the inventory:</p> <p><strong><a href=\"www.xsguard.nl\">XSGuard</a> Management System:</strong> purchased from the Els Shield (Shanghai) Information Technology Co Ltd, network management software developed in the Netherlands. It allows for monitoring of network packets and performing digital forensics.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"www.cisco.com/web/CN\">Cisco</a> 4125 Intrusion Detection System:</strong> purchased from Cisco China and used for monitoring activity on the T1 subnet. Other items sold include the ASA 5505, which \"provides intelligent threat defense and secure communications services that stop attacks before they impact business continuity.\"</p> <p><strong>YangNet Police Network Intrusion Detection System:</strong> purchased from the <a href=\"www.boco.com.cn\">Bright Oceans Corporation</a> in China. According to their (badly translated) website, the product \"acts in a transparent based on a URL filtering and text content filtering, shielding bad, illegal site, on the conduct of fine-grained web content filtering and the precise control and prevent all internal net users to browse the cult, pornography and other undesirable foreign websites and webpages. This feature is suitable for primary and secondary schools, tertiary institutions, government, business and professional applications.\"</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.radware.com\">Radware</a> DefensePro 2000:</strong> an Israeli technology organisation; in this case, the product offers an \"Adaptive Decision Engine: behaviour-based, self-learning mechanism proactively scans for anomalous network, server and client traffic patterns ... and is designed for enterprise core and perimeter deployment, data centers, university campuses and carrier backbones.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>A popular acronym in government, big business and the military for today's centralised surveillance technologies is \"<a href=\"http://www.intute.ac.uk/sciences/cgi-bin/browse.pl?id=25887\">C4I</a>\" (Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence). The top shelf of the technology market offers solutions that integrate closed circuit television with criminal records databases, national health insurance with biometric ID cards, holiday travel bookings with international terrorist lists and so on. </p> <p>Security China 2000, the largest national security exhibition, <a href=\"http://www.dd-rd.ca/site/publications/index.php?id=1266&amp;page=10&amp;subsection=catalogue\">attended by</a> the world's most renowned IT corporations, marked a beginning of Chinese endeavours to create the world's most sophisticated surveillance infrastructure. It was sponsored by the Chinese Public Security Bureau, the ministry in charge of <a href=\"http://www.danwei.org/breaking_news/how_to_be_interrogated_by_the.php\">policing the internet</a>. The meeting was attended by US-based Lucent, Sun Microsystems and Cisco, European wireless giants Nokia and Ericsson, and Canada's Nortel Networks, among many others. The main event was China's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Shield_Project\">Golden Shield Project</a> \u2013 an ambitious plan to link China's national and internet surveillance networks, public record databases, CCTV cameras, speech and face recognition databases, smart cards, credit records and a myriad of regional and national ministries. Their mission was to make the network \"see, hear and think\" in the continuing effort to solidify state control. </p> <p>Nortel Networks continues to work with the Chinese <a href=\"http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/eng/index.jsp\">Tsinghua University</a> on developing speech recognition software, often used in surveillance of telephone conversations, allowing the network to hear. It has also widely distributed its \"personal internet suite\" to providers in Shanghai, Beijing and other major Chinese cities. The software allows IPs not only to monitor what their subscribers are doing online, but to control what information is delivered to them.</p> <p>Content requested from a home computer for topics deemed undesirable will be stored against that person's personal file in numerous databases. The network rolled out with product and knowledge support from western IT firms is designed to think \u2013 that is, to identify individual subscribers when they log on, matching names to IP addresses, and learning, over time, what interests them.</p> <p>The Golden Shield Project also integrates a facial recognition system (FRS), partly developed by <a href=\"http://www.acsysbiometrics.com/\">Acsys Biometrics</a>, a Canadian company. Rolled out across closed-circuit video surveillance networks in Chinese cities, it allows the Golden Shield to see. Rick Collins, senior manager of Nortel's advanced research laboratory, ProtoNet, <a href=\"http://www.dd-rd.ca/site/publications/index.php?id=1266&amp;page=14&amp;subsection=catalogue\">said of</a> the Acsys system: \"Layering Acsys' face recognition's capabilities within Nortel Networks' solutions will make communication networks more personal. I envision a network that knows who you are, where you are and can reach you whether you're on your mobile phone or at your desktop.\"</p> <p>An enthusiastic business partner of the Chinese state apparatus has been Cisco. <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9948331-7.html\">Notorious for</a> its several appearances before the US House of Representatives to explain their role in supplying virtually the entire hardware on which the Golden Shield Project operates, as well as multiple systems to assist Chinese ministries responsible for catching political and social dissidents and censoring the internet. In 1997, Cisco won the contract to supply internet \"firewall boxes\" and, by 2006, they supplied 60% of the Chinese market for routers, switches and other sophisticated networking gear. Its estimated annual revenue from China is $500m.</p> <p>In 2003, Cisco's \"<a href=\"http://news.zdnet.co.uk/security/0,1000000189,39272429,00.htm\">Policenet</a>\" software was rolled out as the backbone of the Chinese state security system. This software, in conjunction with Intel's fingerprint technology, is compatible with the Chinese surveillance systems and allows a policeman stopping a person on the street to scan that person's ID card and access instantly the individual's past political and social behaviour, family history and recent internet activity.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2005/07/68326\">Terry Alberstein</a>, director of corporate affairs for Cisco Systems (Asia Pacific), confirmed in 2005 that Cisco does indeed sell networking and telecommunications equipment directly to the Public Security Bureau and other law enforcement offices throughout China. Cisco recently stated that it also provides service and training to Chinese police officials. Unlike other IT companies, Cisco has signed contracts directly with Chinese public security authorities. </p> <p>It is futile to argue whether western corporations are directly responsible for the uses to which China puts their technologies.

  "<p>German police have detained two men in connection with an attack at an ice cream parlour that left three people dead and another seriously injured. </p> <p>A gang of up to five assailants attacked another group at the cafe with knives and guns. At least four people were seen fleeing from the cafe in the pedestrianised area of Ruesselsheim, south-west of Frankfurt, at about 8pm last night. </p> <p>A 29-year-old Turkish man seated at a table in the caf\u00e9 died at the scene. One of the attackers, a 26-year-old Turk, was one of those killed and his 32-year-old brother was badly wounded. He is under police guard in hospital. </p> <p>A 55-year-old Greek woman, owner of a nearby restaurant, was caught in the crossfire and fatally wounded after being shot in the stomach. <br>A manhunt using dogs and helicopters was launched and two Turkish men have been taken in to custody. </p> <p>Police spokesman Stefan Mueller said the motive for the attack was probably a personal dispute and there had already been trouble between two of the people involved in a nearby town at the weekend. Local media reports have suggested the attack might have been linked to betting debts. </p> <p>As several assailants are still at large, police have warned further clashes are possible. </p> <p>The case has resurrected memories of another multiple shooting in Germany almost exactly one year ago. Six people were shot dead in Duisburg, north-west of Frankfurt, in an attack that may have been connected to a long-running feud between Italian mafia clans.</p>",
  "<p>Inflation will fall sharply next year as the economy slows down, the Bank of England predicted today, offering mortgage payers and borrowers the prospect of interest rate cuts sooner than thought.</p> <p>In its quarterly inflation report published this morning, the Bank said that inflation will fall back below its 2% target in two years if <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/07/interestrates.bankofenglandgovernor\">interest rates continue to be held at 5%</a>.</p> <p>But the Bank also cut its forecast for economic growth, warning that the UK faced a painful adjustment and a difficult 2009.</p> <p>City analysts had feared that inflation was on track to soar above 5% this autumn, following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/13/inflation.creditcrunch1\">yesterday's shock rise to 4.4%</a>, which would prompt the Bank to raise rates despite the economic downturn. However, today's report shows that inflation is likely to spike around 5% before falling dramatically as the economy slows and energy prices ease.</p> <p>Governor Mervyn King explained that the near-term outlook for inflation has \"deteriorated since May\", due to the fall in energy prices. But he stressed that there are still inflation risks from wage growth, forcing the Bank's monetary policy committee to continue treading a balancing line between the rising cost of living and falling economic growth.</p> <p>\"It may still just be summer but there is a feeling of chill in the economic air. The British economy is going through a difficult and painful adjustment due to higher energy and commodity prices and in banking, credit and housing markets. This adjustment to our economy cannot be avoided and as a result, inflation is rising and growth is slowing,\" King said.</p> <p>\"The next year will be a difficult one.\"</p> <p>Interest rate futures trading in London after the report's publication showed that City traders expect borrowing costs will be cut to 4.75% by January 2009. Some dealers even speculated a cut could come by the year end.</p> <p>Jonathan Loynes at Capital Economics said: \"The tone is clearly dovish, with the economy now expected broadly to stagnate over the next year or so. Against that background, we stick to the view that interest rates will eventually fall very sharply once inflation pressures finally recede.\"</p> <p>The Bank sees economic growth as being \"broadly flat over the next year or so\" before picking up quickly to a rate of around 2.4% in two years. This was significantly lower than the slump to 1% growth outlined in the May report. King also suggested that there was a possibility of \"a quarter or two of negative growth\".</p> <p>He added that as food prices stabilise, households' disposable income should recover and the recent falls in the value of the pound will help boost output, altogether supporting a recovery in output and growth.</p> <p>On the housing market front, King said that it was uncertain how far prices would fall but it was certain that the boom levels of last year would not been seen again. \"That was clearly excessive,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Former boilermaker John MacDougall rose from a working class background to take his seat at Westminster. </p> <p>The MP for Glenrothes, who died today aged 60, followed a well-trodden old Labour path, through unions and the local political scene of the 60s and 70s. </p> <p>Born on December 8 1947 in Dunfermline, Fife, MacDougall started work at the RGC oil rig construction yard at Methil, Fife, on the east coast of Scotland in 1964. </p> <p>It was here he got his first taste of politics, becoming a shop steward of the General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trade Union (GMBATU) in 1978. </p> <p>He rose to became shop steward convener of the union and in this role visited parliament for the first time, little suspecting that this would later become his place of work. </p> <p>He strived to gain extra qualifications, studying naval architecture and also receiving a diploma in industrial management and became a member of the Institute of Industrial Managers. </p> <p>In 1981, MacDougall joined the Labour party and became chairman of his local branch. <br>He was elected to Fife council, where he served for nearly 20 years. </p> <p>For 14 years he was full-time at the local authority, where he held various posts including council leader for nine years. </p> <p>He was elected to parliament as an MP for Central Fife in 2001. </p> <p>He took over the seat from former Scotland first minister Henry McLeish, also a former Fife council leader, who stood down as an MP on his election to the Scottish parliament. </p> <p>MacDougall was re-elected in 2005 to the newly-created Glenrothes constituency, which took in most of the old Central Fife seat. </p> <p>As an MP, he was strongly pro-European with extensive connections in the European union. </p> <p>He was also vice-president of the Assembly of the European Regions for a time. </p> <p>He leaves a wife, Cathy, and two adult children. </p> <p>MacDougall's Glenrothes constituency is next door to that of the prime minister, Gordon Brown, Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath. </p> <p>The last byelection fought in Fife, in February 2006, saw the Liberal Democrats seize power in a strong Labour seat. </p> <p>Labour had a majority of 11,500.

  "<p>The former head of the government's UK anti-drug co-ordination unit (UKADCU), Julian Critchley, posted to BBC Home Affairs correspondent Mark Easton's blog last week, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/markeaston/2008/07/the_war_on_drugs.html\">The War on Drugs</a>, calling for the legalisation of drugs. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/profile/?userid=12801828\">In his post</a> he also reports how those he met during his time at the unit knew that criminalisation was causing more harm than the drugs themselves. (This comes as no surprise to anyone who has read the damning report from the <a href=\"http://www.tdpf.org.uk/Policy_General_Strategy_Unit_Drugs_Report_phase_1.htm\">prime minister's strategy unit</a> from 2003.)</p> <p>Critchley says: </p> <blockquote> <p>I think what was truly depressing about my time in UKADCU was that the overwhelming majority of professionals I met, including those from the police, the health service, government and voluntary sectors held the same view: the illegality of drugs causes far more problems for society and the individual than it solves. Yet publicly, all those intelligent, knowledgeable people were forced to repeat the nonsensical mantra that the Government would be 'tough on drugs', even though they all knew that the Government's policy was actually causing harm.</p> </blockquote> <p>Critchley is to be congratulated for speaking out with such candour on the issue. I have met many former and current civil servants who are of the same opinion, but haven't gone public. What Critchley makes absolutely clear is that many, if not most of those working in the drugs field are knowingly colluding with a regime that actively causes harm. Their silence is not based on ignorance but is tacit support for one of the great social policy disasters of the last 100 years. </p> <p>Critchley, having retrained as a teacher, concludes with the following:</p> <blockquote> <p>I find that when presented with the facts, the students I teach are quite capable of considering issues such as this, and reaching rational conclusions even if they started with a blind Daily Mail-esque approach. I find it a shame that no mainstream political party accords the electorate the same respect.</p> </blockquote> <p>His final comment ought to send a shiver down the spine of every UK voter. If you voted in the last election, you probably voted for prohibition. You voted to gift hundreds of billions of pounds to organised crime each year, to undermine the social and economic development of producer countries such as Colombia, Afghanistan as well as transit countries such as Guinea Bissau and Jamaica. You voted to double the amount of acquisitive crime in the UK and to double the prison population with it. Your \"X\" contributed to misery and degradation for millions of the most marginalised people on earth. Unless we all do something to change it, you will probably vote for prohibition next time too. </p> <p>In 2003 at a press conference, I asked the then drugs spokesperson at the Home Office, Bob Ainsworth MP, whether the government would support a <a href=\"http://www.tdpf.org.uk/Policy_Economics_WhyWeNeedAnAudit.htm\">cost benefit analysis</a> of drug law enforcement. Quick as a flash his reply came back: \"Why would we want to do that unless we were going to legalise drugs?\" Does that sound like a man ignorant of where that audit trail would lead?</p> <p>It is the candour of the likes of Critchley <a href=\"http://www.tdpf.org.uk/MediaNews_Reform_supporters.htm\">and others</a> that exposes the hypocrisy of those failing to speak out and makes prohibition untenable in the long term. As Joseph McNamara, former police chief of Kansas City and San Jose put it: \"The drug war cannot stand the light of day. It will collapse as quickly as the Vietnam war, as soon as people find out what's really going on.\" Tragically and despicably, the government's commitment to populist posturing means that the collapse will come far too late for many.</p>",
  "<p>Georgia said its troops had pulled out of the separatist region of Abkhazia today as a ceasefire appeared to be holding after the Kremlin laid down humiliating peace terms as the price for halting the Russian invasion and its four-day rout of Georgian forces.</p> <p>The withdrawal from the small part of the region Georgian troops still held may help reduce the chances of more fighting. The ceasefire requires both sides to return to positions they held before the conflict started in South Ossetia last week.</p> <p>Faced with strong western denunciation, President Dmitry Medvedev of Russia called a halt to the Russian offensive yesterday and negotiated terms for a truce and a broader settlement with President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who, as chair of the European Union, rushed to the region to try to strike a deal on a ceasefire.</p> <p>Early this morning in Tbilisi, Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili, signalled his partial assent to the terms, announcing with Sarkozy that he accepted the ceasefire. But Saakashvili raised questions about a continuing Russian military presence in Georgia and the prospects for any durable settlement looked uncertain.</p> <p>\"We do not yet have a peace deal, we have a provisional cessation of hostilities; but this is significant progress,\" Sarkozy said after talks with Medvedev in Moscow and before taking the terms to Tbilisi. This morning, Sarkozy predicted Saakashvili would accept Russian terms on the broader settlement.</p> <p>As EU foreign ministers prepared to meet to discuss the crisis today, foreign secretary David Miliband today suggested \"there is merit\" at seeking an \"international presence\" in the area, possibly through the United Nations or the Organisation for Security and Co-Operation in Europe.</p> <p>The former Georgian president Eduard Shevardnadze was today quoted as saying Georgia made a \"grave mistake\" in advancing into South Ossetia. </p> <p>In an interview with German newspaper Bild he said: \"We have a tradition, that in times of crisis, the opposition stands united behind the president and does not attack him. But Georgia should not have advanced into Tskhinvali (South Ossetia's capital) in so unprepared a way. That was a grave error.\"</p> <p>Medvedev branded Saakashvili a \"lunatic\" as he outlined tough terms to the French leader, in effect demanding Georgian capitulation to vastly superior Russian forces.</p> <p>\"The difference between lunatics and other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them,\" Medvedev said. \"So you have to use surgery.\"</p> <p>The key demands are that the Georgian leader pledges, in an agreement that is signed and legally binding, to abjure all use of force to resolve Georgia's territorial disputes with the two breakaway pro-Russian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia; and that Georgian forces withdraw entirely from South Ossetia and are no longer part of the joint \"peacekeeping\" contingent there with Russian and local forces.</p> <p>Medvedev also insisted the populations of the two regions had to be allowed to vote on whether they wanted to join Russia, prefiguring a possible annexation that would enfeeble Georgia and leave Saakashvili looking crushed. </p> <p>If he balked at the terms, said Sergei Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister: \"We will be forced to take other measures to prevent any repetition of the situation that emerged because of the outrageous Georgian aggression.\"</p> <p>Russian leaders consistently emphasise that Georgian forces perpetrated atrocities against civilians when Saakashvili gave the go-ahead last week for the bungled attempt to recapture South Ossetia.</p> <p>The gamble triggered the onslaught which the US state department yesterday described as \"plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of Russia\".</p> <p>Georgian forces have been part of the peacekeeping force in South Ossetia for the past 15 years. But Russian leaders declared yesterday the Georgians would not return, and South Ossetia would be under Russian control. </p> <p>\"They shot their brother Russian peacekeepers, then they finished them off with bayonets, so we are not going to see them there any more,\" said Dmitri Rogozin, the Russian ambassador to Nato in Brussels. </p> <p>Medvedev spoke by phone with the EU foreign policy chief, Javier Solana and told him \"there are a few things that need to be discussed to get a full ceasefire,\" said a European official.</p> <p>\"The Russians are saying that they will never again accept Georgians in any form in South Ossetia. They see them as a Trojan horse that started the attacks last week.\"</p> <p>While Nato leaders in Brussels stressed that South Ossetia and Abkhazia were part of Georgia, Medvedev encouraged the secession of the two breakaway regions.</p> <p>\"Ossetians and Abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account, including what happened in the past few days,\" he said.</p> <p>Western officials at Nato, in the EU, in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and in Washington, while calling for an immediate ceasefire, also demanded that Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity be upheld.</p> <p>Following a meeting of Nato states yesterday, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, Nato's secretary general, accused Russia of not respecting Georgia's territorial integrity. \"Abkhazia and Ossetia, if I mention territorial integrity, are to the best of my knowledge part of Georgia.\" He added that \"Nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict\".</p> <p>For months, said European officials, Saakashvili had rejected pressure to commit to forgoing the use of force. But Lavrov said the Georgian army would have to be returned to bases, and that any peace deal would \"require the signing of a legally-binding treaty on the non-use of force.\"</p> <p>The Russians have also agreed to withdraw their troops from Georgia proper and return their \"peacekeeping\" contingent to positions held before the fighting. But until monitoring of the proposed ceasefire was up and running, the Russians reserved the right to take unspecified \"additional security measures\" in Georgia.</p> <p>While thousands rallied in support of Saakashvili yesterday outside the parliament in Tbilisi, there was a growing sense among many Georgians that his decision to attack had been a disastrous blunder - with Russia's overwhelming response both predictable and highly costly.</p> <p>\"Why are people waving flags? It's not as if we won,\" Lasha Darkveldze, 23, said as supporters thronged the centre of Tbilisi and marched on its freedom square. \"Saakashvili should now resign.\"</p> <p>\"We hope he is going to disappear from Georgia,\" Bacha Janashia, 24, a student, said. \"I wonder why he did it. He has only 10,000 soldiers and he takes on Russia.\"</p> <p>If the Russian terms are demeaning, Saakashvili's bargaining position is extremely weak given the virtual disintegration of his armed forces. Abandoned tanks litter the road between Tbilisi and Gori - dumped following Russia's swift advance deep into Georgia on Monday.</p> <p>In Gori, Russia's ceasefire appeared to be holding yesterday afternoon after numerous air attacks. Russian planes bombed the town yesterday morning - killing at least five civilians, including a Dutch TV journalist.</p>",

  "<p>The outbreak of hostilities between Russia and Georgia over South Ossetia on Friday had UK news organisations scrambling to cover the conflict in a region where there are relatively few correspondents on the ground, at a time when their newsgathering resources were focused on the Beijing Olympics.</p> <p>Five media workers - four journalists and a driver - have been killed covering the conflict, and others wounded, according to the <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/greenslade/2008/08/insi_warning_after_five_news_s.html\">International News Safety Institute</a>, which highlights the dangers of reporting the Georgia war zone.</p> <p>Covering the withdrawal of Georgian troops from Gori over the weekend, BBC reporter Gavin Hewitt came under fire from a Russian fighter plane shooting rockets at the TV crew's motorcade.

Well, like it or not, Beijing has put on one of the most memorable ceremonies any of us have ever seen,\" wrote the 6pm bulletin's output editor, Katy Searle, on the BBC blog.</p> <p>ITV led its Friday news bulletins with breaking news of the war on Europe's south-eastern boarder with Asia and the ITV News editor-in-chief, David Mannion, said he believed the BBC had made a mistake with the running order of its 6pm bulletin that day.</p> <p>\"It was an aberration.

We got on the story quickly and the coverage for Saturday's paper was as good as anyone's,\" said Brian McDermott, the Guardian's foreign desk news editor.</p> <p>The Guardian's Moscow correspondent, Luke Harding, was then called back from his holiday and sent to the region to cover the story over the weekend.</p> <p>Many news outlets had to rely on copy and pictures supplied by international news agencies.</p> <p>Prior to the outbreak of fighting, Reuters had two text reporters in Tbilisi, covering tensions in the region. </p> <p>Last Thursday, correspondent Margarita Antidze filed stories about the escalation of tensions that led to the outbreak of war.</p> <h2>First wave of rockets</h2> <p>Reuters also had cameraman David Chkhikvishvili in Tbilisi. During the early hours of Friday morning, his pictures of the first wave of rockets being fired by Georgian military at targets in South Ossetia were being dispatched to foreign news desks across the world and formed the bulk of the early coverage.</p> <p>Once the fighting intensified Reuters added more local staff and established a satellite uplink to transmit live video, a spokeswoman said.</p> <p>Increased international and local agency reports on the ground resulted in expanded coverage in the Sunday papers in the UK and online as news websites began publishing a greater range of multimedia content charting the development of the conflict.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/georgia/\">Telegraph.co.uk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">theguardian.com</a>, began filing reports and timelines, building picture galleries and creating dedicated areas of their sites to pull the multi-faceted content strands together.</p> <p>The Sky News website put its coverage centre stage, running updates of the situation in the Caucasus on its breaking news carousel and featuring its coverage under its <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/skynews\">editor's pick</a>.</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>A convoy of three buses and an escort of armed Russian Special Forces soldiers travelled across the border with Russia into South Ossetia yesterday, in a trip organised by the Kremlin for foreign media to witness first hand the destruction in Tskhinvali.</p> <p>At the village of Dzhava 20 miles beyond the border a huge queue of Russian military hardware stood pointing south, testament to the might of the resurgent Russian state. </p> <p>Several truck-mounted rocket launchers were a sign of Moscow's intent to hold Tskhinvali at all costs. Approaching Tskhinvali, the group of reporters was transferred to armoured personnel carriers because of the risk of fire from Georgian snipers, said the Russian officers leading the trip. </p> <p>In villages close to the city there were many burned out houses, and others were still ablaze. In the city itself it was clear that claims the city had been levelled to the ground by artillery were exaggerated. However, it was also evident that while some neighbourhoods were intact, there were patches of terrible destruction. </p> <p>At a crossroads in the north of the city there was evidence of a fierce fire fight. Three destroyed Georgian tanks were slewed across the road, a mess of ash and twisted metal. The heavy turret of one tank had been tossed across the street, falling through a shop front. Nearby on the ground lay a human foot. </p> <p>Colonel Igor Konashenko of the Russian army said: \"There were Georgian attacks overnight but our troops are in full control of the city. So far we've had no orders to move south into Georgia.\"</p> <p>Hearing of a ceasefire yesterday, civilians began to emerge from bunkers and basements. At the crossroads, Izolda Deppiyeva, 50, looked out on the scene of ruined ground floor apartment in a block riddled by gunfire. She recalled the moment when Georgian artillery first hit the city. </p> <p>\"There was a great wave of pressure which twisted me and flung me against the kitchen wall.\"</p> <p>A former theatre stage actress, Deppiyeva said she had lived for four days in a cellar with her relatives without food and water.</p> <p>\"I could not leave,\" she said. \"This land is my body, my home. We are a proud beautiful people and we are not leaving. I survived, I am alive!\" </p> <p>In the yard behind the apartment block a group of Ossetian fighters were seated at a wooden bench eating mutton and drinking wine: \"We are raising a toast to those who are left,\" said Ruslan Kostoyev, 33. \"Those tanks in the street, we hit them with rocket propelled grenades from the basement.\" </p> <p>Kostoyev accused Western leading countries of arming Georgia in the conflict: \"A Georgian only knows how to ride a cow,\" he said, \"the aeroplanes which destroyed the building were Ukrainian,\" he said. </p> <p>Another fighter said: \"The Georgians were 30 times stronger than us. They wanted to kill us to destroy everything. But we held them off.\" </p> <p>Outside in the street, a priest in an immaculate black cassock walked through the scene of devastation. Saurmag Bazzate, an Ossetian prior, arrived in Tskhinvali on Monday. \"I came to be with my people,\" he said. \"Those who perpetrated this horror are criminals who must be punished by God. This war is a result of Georgian fascism, which has flourished with the support of the West.\" </p> <p>Russian officials in the city say their main aim is now to contain a humanitarian disaster by repairing water supplies insuring that bread factories are working and re-establishing an electricity supply. </p> <p>Close to the centre of the city Russian officers led the group to the city's main hospital which was hit by small arms fire and shells during the first days of fighting. Doctors at the hospital said they had been forced to carry out operations in corridors and the basement of the building without electricity, water or light. </p> <p>Tina Zakharova, one of the doctors, pointed out chunks of shrapnel which had hit the building. </p> <p>\"This is the humanitarian aid that Georgia sent us,\" she said, \"and that,\" she said, pointing at a field hospital nearby, \"is the help we received from Russia. Which do you think we should chose?\" She added: \"I've never heard anything so monstrous as people shelling a hospital.\" </p> <p>In total, said Zakharova, 224 injured people had been treated at the hospital and two people had died there. Just south of the city centre a group of reporters were shown a street entirely destroyed by a Grad missile attack. Homes along the 100m street had been reduced to rubble. </p> <p>One man showed the Guardian the metal casing of a Grad rocket lodged in the ruins of his home: \"We managed to escape to the shelter just in time,\" he said, pointing at the mouth of a cellar protected by huge chunks of concrete. </p> <p>Colonel Konashenko said: \"The Georgians could not get tanks through these narrow streets. So first they turned it to ruins with a Grad attack and tried to punch through here to the centre of the city. There was heavy fighting in the streets. I think more than 500 bodies were pulled out of this part of town.\" </p> <p>Asked if there had been atrocities against civilians the Colonel replied: \"I personally saw one man beheaded lying in the street and others say they witnessed civilians who had been finished off with a shot to the back of the head.\"</p> <p>Back at the hospital there were sounds of gunfire and then the crump of mortars landing somewhere in the city. First one explosion, then a second. When a third hit, sounding louder, the Colonel said: \"It's time to move. Let's go.\"</p>",
  "<p>The intoxicating possibility that England could soon reassemble three of their Ashes-winning fast bowling quartet - following comebacks for Andrew Flintoff and Steve Harmison with that of Simon Jones - has taken a blow with Jones' withdrawal from the England Lions squad to face South Africa at Grace Road tomorrow. </p> <p>Jones' selection for the Lions, an England shadow XI, was his first representative call-up since the 2005 Ashes series, and had begun to challenge assumptions that serious injury had ended his England career. <br>The Welshman has pulled out with a \"slight hamstring strain,\" which will take a week to heal and that will scotch suggestions that he can use the match - a warm-up for South Africa for the impending ODI series - to push his case for inclusion on an England winter tour to India. </p> <p>When Worcestershire signed Jones this season - his previous county Glamorgan had only been prepared to offer him a match-by-match contract - it was described in one quarter as the biggest hospital pass in England cricket transfer history. But Worcestershire sit at the top of the Second Division of the championship and Jones, although he has not taken many top-order wickets, has still made quite an impact with 52 scalps in nine championship matches. </p> <p>He is replaced in the Lions side by Gloucestershire's Steve Kirby. The Lions, who also face South Africa at Derby on Saturday, include five players in England's one-day squad. Kent's Rob Key captains in Leicester, with Middlesex's Ed Joyce assuming control at Derby two days later. </p> <p>The captaincy gaining all the attention, though, is that of Kevin Pietersen, with his relationship with England's coach, Peter Moores, a source of much discussion. </p> <p>Pietersen's lavish praise of his England players at The Oval invited the notion that Moores might now have to become the bad cop to Pietersen's good cop, but he did not see it that way. \"I think he can speak openly and be fair,\" he said. \"When you get criticism, as long as its fair and honest, players will always accept it and Kevin can do that. They would take it on the chin and respond to it.\" </p> <p>\"There will be a case to be supportive, but also there will be times when he will have words with players because that will be the right thing to do at the time. What they will know with Kevin is that he'll be in there scrapping with them, he will put his own neck on the line and he'll get stuck in and go with it and I think they'll respect him for that.\" </p> <p>Monty Panesar, criticised for his failure to bowl out South Africa at Edgbaston - the Test where South Africa took the series - has nevertheless moved up to 10th in the latest ICC Test bowling rankings. <br></p>",

Stephen Cummings is in the men's trial which starts at 10.10am, but hopefully I'll be tucked up in bed by then so I'll have to catch up on what happened on the super soar-away rebranded Guardian website.</p> <p>The Great Britain men's four go in their semi-finals and the single sculler Alan Campbell is also in his semi. <strong>Caitlin McClatchey</strong> is our big muscular hope in the pool for the final of the 200m women's freestyle</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2.28am:</strong> Oh and our sailing heroes are back too. <strong>Ben Ainslie</strong> in the Finn and <strong>Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson</strong> in the Yngling are out on the water again after a rest day.</p> <p>There'll be more sitting down on horses too, as Jane Gregory and Emma Hindle begin day one of <strong>the dressage</strong>.

One wonders if tiredness will become a factor by the end of the day.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>2.55am:</strong> The mails are flooding in about the comments of the Australian Olympic chairman <strong>John Coates</strong>. Apparently the personal hygiene of the British swimmers leaves a little to be desired. Surely Australian <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob1rYlCpOnM\">swimming pools</a> have dirty plasters, veruca socks and wee wee in them too? Remember - no diving or running. And as for petting...</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>3.05am:</strong> Alain Bernard of France (he's a monster) breaks the world record for the 100m freestyle in the first semi with 47.2s.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>3.09am:</strong> I'm like, wow. Bernard held the record for about three minutes. <strong>Eamon Sullivan</strong> of Australia wins the second 100m freestyle semi-final in 47.05s. Wonder if he is related to the Sullivans I saw on the telly in the 1980s? Oh hang on. They weren't real.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>3.13am:</strong> \"Sadly I can reliably inform you that most of the public pools in Sydney fall somewhere between immaculate and stunning - it's the Aussies who swim in them that are the problem,\" says Alexander Pace.

Phelps is getting ready for his latest tilt at glory in the 200m butterfly. Ironic that, as I'm feeling quite nervous.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>3.25am:</strong> He's done it. <strong>Michael Phelps</strong> makes history by winning his fourth gold of this Games and his 10th gold overall - more than anyone else in history - in the 200m butterfly. Oh and he broke the world record again. I'm going to get one of those suits...</p> <p>Speaking of the 1980s, Phelps reminds me of a certain gold-winning otter from the great and forgotten film <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldLMm59YTnA\">Animalympics</a></p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>3.30am:</strong> If you think Phelps has created a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/12/3\">big stink</a>, check this out</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>3.31am:</strong> Britain's <strong>Jemma Lowe</strong> comes third in the first women's 200m butterfly semi-final, despite leading for most of the race.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>3.37am:</strong> The second semi of the 200m butterfly is so fast Lowe is squeezed out into ninth and so misses the final.

When Windows Won't Open or Celebrity Chair Swap?</p> <p>PS British TV is just as bad. It's nothing personal.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>3.43am:</strong> Meanwhile China's incredibly small gymnasts are really going for it (technical term) at the <strong>National Indoor Stadium</strong>. The US team usurped their rivals at the World Championships last year and now it's payback time. Or might be.</p> <p>I can't get used to stadium names without sponsors.

They lead by over a full point from the US, who are themselves three points ahead of Russia. I think the BBC's gymnastics commentators are without doubt the most annoying on TV. The woman sounds like the PA announcer in a supermarket.</p> <p>Oh dear. One of the Chinese girls, Li Shanshan, fell off the beam, which could let the US back into the hunt for gold.</p> <p>While we're at it, here's another clip from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox0eIylJ_OE\">Animalympics</a> with gymnastics.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>4.56am:</strong> Time for a quick update. In cycling the women's time trial is underway and Britain's <strong>Emma Pooley</strong> is off and running.</p> <p>You would think there would be someone in Britain who can use an epee or a foil - well <strong>Richard Kruse</strong> has beaten Romania's Virgil Saliscan 15-6 in the first round of the <strong>men's individual foil</strong>. He will now face the German world champion Peter Joppich. Mmmm, it brings to mind a scene from the movie <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CL8mh_4-0s\">The Life and death of Colonel Blimp</a></p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>5am:</strong> \"Ahhh!

What a great effort.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>6.13am: </strong>I'm getting a flood of <strong>Greco-Roman wrestling</strong> results, but it's all so confusing, the only reference point I've got is AC Slater from US comedy Saved By the Bell.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>6.17am: </strong><strong>Judo </strong>It escaped me earlier but Winston Gordon was beaten by Khurshid Nabiev. Winston Gordon, possibly the most British sounding name at the Olympics.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>6.20am: </strong>More proper news - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/13/olympics2008.olympicscycling\">Emma Pooley bags silver</a>.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>6.23am: </strong>Al Parkes wonders: Are certain swimming races (e.g breaststroke) the only races where contestants have to get as quickly as they can, under their own steam, from a to b by using a sub optimal method for the distance to be covered?\" Err no, I'm afraid not Al, have you never marveled at the 10, 20 and 50km walks?</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>6.26am: </strong><strong>Softball </strong>Kyla is going crazy...and the reason? The USA have scored a run in the bottom of the 5th. Can Australia respond?</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>6.33am: </strong>Right it's quiet at the moment, so I've got time to tell you what's going on later today. Stephen Cummings will try and follow Emma Pooley's lead, when he competes in the <strong>men's time trial</strong>. There's some British interest in the <strong>rowing</strong>, the Murray's are in <strong>tennis</strong> action and the <strong>men's hockey</strong> team see if they can follow up on their win against Pakistan when they face the Netherlands.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>6.40am: </strong> Read about how <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/13/olympicsgymnastics.olympics20081\">China's women triumphed over the Americans</a>.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>6.44am: </strong><strong>Water polo</strong> Kyle Hauptman reckons that there's a possible upset on the cards as Australia are beating Hungary 4-3.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>6.46am: </strong><strong>Shooting </strong> Mongolia's Gundegmaa Otryad will take a three-point-lead into the women's 25m pistol final. They'll be cheering on the street of Ulan Bator if she can hold on.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>6.52am: </strong><strong>Women's volleyball</strong> The USA now top Group A after beating Venezuela 3-1.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>6.58am: </strong><strong>Softball </strong>I've been on tenterhooks but Kyla has told me that: \"The USA has beaten Australia 3-0. A very good game, well-played by both sides.\" I only wish I could have been there.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>7.00am: </strong>Matt Baker has double-twisted his way into the BBC studio. Naturally he's as excited as ever.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>7.02am: </strong>Some results for you to cast your mince pies over. <strong>Women's basketball</strong> Russia 71-65 Belarus, Spain 74-55 Czech Republic. <strong>Men's hockey</strong> Australia 10-0 South Africa, South Korea 5-2 China. <strong>Softball </strong>China 7-1 Venezuela.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>7.08am: </strong><strong>Cycling </strong>One thing that may have been missed in all the excitement over Emma Pooley was Jeannie Longo's performance. At the ripe old age of 49 she missed out on a medal by just two seconds. Crikey!</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>7.12am: </strong>An update on a right ding-dong battle in the <strong>women's water polo</strong>. Australia and Hungary tied 7-7, with the eastern Europeans grabbing the equaliser with just four seconds left. Thanks Kyle in Sydney.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>7.18am: </strong> Dan Timbers doesn't share my love of softball: \"It's not a sport, its rounders for fatties,\" he scoffs.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>7.20am: </strong><strong>Cycling </strong>More good news for Team GB Steve Cummings currently has the fastest time in the <strong>men's time trial</strong>. He couldn't could he?</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>7.33am: </strong> <strong>Diving</strong> Over in the Water Cube the men's 3m synchro final is underway. The Australian pair have just gone, and to my untrained eyes that looked a bit out of sync.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>7.39am: </strong><strong>Diving </strong>After round one the British pair of Nick Robinson-Baker and Ben Swain lie in fourth place. That's not bad, but it's early days yet.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>7.42am: </strong><strong>Cycling </strong>John Ogmore doesn't share my positive views on Steve Cummings: \"A top 15 place would be a good result - I wouldn't be surprised to see him at least two to three minutes down on the winner.\" Can we all try and be a bit more optimistic please.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>7.45am: </strong>Everyone who keeps emailing to tell me to stop jinxing British athletes - consider me reprimanded.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>8.00am: </strong>Back to the <strong>diving</strong> after round three the British pair have dropped to fifth</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>8.20am:</strong> Hello. Apologies for the little break there - not so easy to post when our building's internet has stopped working. Still, hopefully the delay has built the anticipation nicely - both for my grand arrival and the crucial final round of the men's 3m synchronised dive.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>8.24am:</strong> <strong>Diving</strong> While we were away Britain's Nick Robinson-Baker and Ben Swain dropped all the way to seventh. They're still there with one round to go, but after a moderately impressive effort in round five, they are now only 11 points between them and second. They're still not going to win a medal, but we can at least pretend to be excited, can't we?</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>8.27am:</strong> <strong>Diving</strong> The Brits have had their last go, which looked good to me, but then I am speaking as a man for whom \"doing a bomb\" represents the height of springboard-to-water sophistication.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>8.30am:</strong> It's a gold medal! For China's Chen Ying in the <strong>pistol shooting</strong>. Our divers are still on course for second last. Mongolia's Gundegmaa Otryad and Germany's Munkhbayer Dorjsuren pick up silver and bronze in the shooting.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>8.34am:</strong> <strong>Diving</strong> And another gold for China as they hold off Russia and Ukraine at the Bird's Nest. That makes 16 now.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>8.40am:</strong> Great news - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/13/olympics20084\">this morning's Beijinger has landed</a>. Elsewhere, <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/13/georgia_and_russia_throw_sand.html\"> Lawrence Donegan has the lowdown on the most politically-charged game of beach volleyball ever - Georgia v Russia</a>, while <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/13/phelps_stakes_his_claim_for_ti.html\">Paul Kelso is already wondering if Michael Phelps can go on to win another eight gold medals at London 2012</a>.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>8.48am: Equestrianism</strong> I knew that he fancied himself as a cricketer, but after hearing of his Olympic bronze medal this morning, I have to ask - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/13/olympics2008.olympicsequestrian\">is there nothing Phil Neville can't do</a>?</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>8.50am:</strong> Al Parkes has wasted no time reading the Beijinger. \"Andy Bull says, Phelps 'didn't seem to break sweat' - but how on earth could he tell?\" Don't question Bull, he has magic powers.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>8.57am:</strong> A spot of confusion is afoot. \"Re. your 8.34 entry 'another gold for China as they hold off Russia and Ukraine at the Bird's Nest'. Is the Bird's Nest one of these Olympic sports for Johnny Foreigner that we don't really get here in Britain,\" asks Bruce Jackson. \"Like Handball or Softball?\" Well softball's easy Bruce - think rounders only with everyone taking it <em>really</em> seriously. The Bird's Nest, on the other hand, is the Olympics venue that houses the running track and not, in fact, the venue I meant to refer to. I had meant to say \"the Water Cube\" - which is where all the Olympic pools are.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>9.07am: rowing</strong> An absolutely storming comeback from Britain's Alan Campbell in the men's singles sculls semi-finals - he was some way back in fourth going into the last 100m, yet heaved his way up into second by the end to make the final. New Zealand's Mahe Drysdale - three-time world champion and favourite for the gold - barely makes the final after <em>just</em> hanging on to third. The Czech Republic's Ondrej Synek was first.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>9.15am: archery</strong> Britain's Alan Wills is up against Italy's Mauro Nespoli in the men's individual archery ... I'm so conflicted. Elsewhere, in the women's 69kg <strong>weightlifting</strong>, China's Liu Chunhong if China has just broken the world record for the snatch twice - lifting 125kg, then 128kg.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>9.18am:</strong> One of the more entertaining aspects of the rowing is the posse of spectators at Shunyi who seem to have shown up on bikes so they can pedal alongside and keep up. \"I genuinely don't see why people don't play handball,\" parps Rob Evans. \"My girlfriend plays for her uni team and its like basketball without the hoops crossed with rugby with a goal. If you're good at either sport, then you'll be good at handball. All the guys on the men's team are 6ft plus, Eastern European and scare me.\"</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>9.24am: archery</strong> Alan Wills has beaten Mauro Nespoli in the archery and is through to the last 16. I'm crying and cheering inside all at the same time.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>9.27am: cycling</strong> Britain's Steve Cummings is third in this morning's time-trial standings so far, but he'd be lucky to hold onto bronze at this stage, given the pace others - Tour de France runner-up Cadel Evans and 2007 Tour winner Alberto Contador among them - have been showing.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>9.32am:</strong> \"The cyclists at Shunyi are not spectators, they're coaches,\" chips in Joanne Harris, a New Zealander who is apparently finding this morning's racing \"a bit stressful\". \"Every regatta (even little club ones) has cyclists on the bank. It's the only way a coach can watch the whole 2k race.\" Cheers for the pointer - but are there not even <em>a few</em> fans in there? If not then the rowers in that last race must've had about six coaches each ...</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>9.37am: tennis</strong> Rafael Nadal is 3-2 down to Igor Andreev in the first set of their third round match, but it's with serve so far.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>9.43am:</strong> Joanne Harris has emailed back to let me know that she is not a New Zealander, but merely <em>in</em> New Zealand right now. Noted. Richard Smyth, meanwhile, has something to get off his chest. \"A thought on Michael Phelps: doesn't the fact that one man can win eight golds - or, for that matter, that Mark Spitz could win seven - suggest that the events into which the sport is divided aren't really appropriate? Surely the purpose of dividing up a sport into events is to reward a range of different skills and/or physical attributes, as with running or boxing. If one guy can do them all, it suggests to me all the events are rewarding pretty much the same skills. Of course, this takes nothing away from Phelps' achievements, but it seems a bit odd. The same thing strikes me about wheelchair athletics - fair play to Tanni Grey-Thompson, but if one person can win both a marathon and a sprint at the highest level then something's up.\" I actually do take your point to an extent here - Phelps' achievements are undoutedly incredible, but all this talk of \"the greatest Olympian\" does - to my mind - slightly miss the mark, as there are plenty of athletes who do not have the opportunity to compete for so many medals in their respective disciplines.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>9.47am: rowing</strong> Britain's Matthew Wells and Stephen Rowbotham have finished third in their semi-final in the men's double sculls, meaning they make the final, but will be given an outside lane. Their time was actually better than that with which Australia won the other semi.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>9.55am: rowing</strong> And now Britain romp home first in the semi-finals of the men's four. Australia and France will join them in the final after finishing second and third respectively. Ian Renwick has confirmed for me that it is possible to hire out bikes at Shunyi - for free!</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>10am:</strong> \"Working less than 5 minutes walk from work meant I walked home to watch the rowing semi-finals,\" chimes David Johnson. \"However, in South Africa today there were two channels showing the same boxing match, one channel on weightlifting and one channel inexplicably showing a still camera image of the wrestling arena where there was not a competitor in sight - so what is going on in the rowing?\" Erm, fairly sure I've covered all the Brits so far ... anyone else you were worried about?</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>10.02am:</strong> Switzerland's Fabian Cancellara grabs the gold in the men's time-trial - a clear 33 seconds faster than runner-up Gustav Larsson, of Sweden. USA's Levi Leipheimer finished third, while Team GB's Steve Cummings won't draw coverage in any other country after pootling home in 11th.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>10.04am:</strong> The United States' Michael Orozco has earned himself a straight red card in the third minute of their men's soccerball preliminary against Nigeria. In the style of a certain Mr Wenger I, err, did not see the incident, but I believe it involved a flailing arm connecting with an opponent's face. A draw here would be enough for USA to qualify, but would mean Nigeria could still be caught by Holland.</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>10.10am:</strong> \"Why is everyone knocking Michael Phelps,\" demands David Brigden. \"Let's not take anything away from his achievements, whether it's doggy paddle, with eyes shut or whatever other style, in a short time span he is qualifying, competing and winning these events in world record times. The greatest ever? In his own words 'no', but the most decorated olympian ... A resounding 'yes'.\"</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>10.12am:</strong> Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Germany take first, second and third in the second semi-final in the men's four. The British crew's time in the first semi was a good two seconds faster than that posted by Slovenia, so the Beeb has wasted no time in annointing us as gold medal winners in waiting.</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>10.16am: archery</strong> Alan Wills has beaten another Italian - Marco Galiazzo - and is consequently through to the last 16, where he will face Cuba's Juan Carlos Stevens on Friday.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>10.22am: tennis</strong> Rafael Nadal is 6-4, 2-0 up against Igor Andreev in the third round of the men's singles. This one's very much over.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>10.26am:</strong> Some sailboat fun for you. When I say \"fun\", I really mean \"results\". Britain's Nick Rogers and Joe Glanfield finished ninth and sixth in races today and are up to third in the men's 470. You can stop worrying about the women's 470, though, after Christina Bassadone and Saskia Clark finished 15th and 13th in to finish the day in 11th. Do likewise for men's 49er team Stevie Morrison and Ben Rhodes, who are now eighth - in good part because they were disqualified for a false start in race seven. Paul Goodison, meanwhile, was fourth in Athens but sits seventh here after finishing 15th in his third race.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>10.30am:</strong> \"I saw Eddie the Eagle Edwards doing a personal appearance at the Big Chill festival last week and I'm sure he was wearing a piece of tinsel wound his neck,\" honks Chris Riley. \"That makes him the most decorated Olympian I have ever seen!\" I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt here and assume Chris has been up all night watching Olympic rounders.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>10.35am:</strong> USA v Nigeria is still 0-0 despite some enthusiastic trumpet and drum playing in the stands. If I were you, I'd take this moment to check out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2008/aug/11/olympics20081?picture=336497775\">our gallery of the funniest pictures of the day from Beijing</a>.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>10.44am: rowing</strong> Great Britain's women's eight are off to a bad start in the repechage at Shunyi. They need to finish in the top four to make the final ...</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>10.46am: rowing</strong>... which they do comfortably enough in the end, finishing third behind Canada and Holland. Australia also make it through, but Germany, whose rowers have been having a stinker across the board here so far, are out after coming in fifth.</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>10.55am:</strong> France have their tenth medal - and their first gold - after Steeve Guenot beat Kyrgyzstan's Kanatbek Begaliev in the men's 66kg Greco-Roman wrestling. Fiona Pennie is up shortly in the women's K1 <strong>kayaking</strong> heats and needs either some serious improvement, some help from her opponents or both to make the semi-finals after finishing 19th in the first heat. She needs to make the top 15 to go through.</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>11.02am:</strong> Now I'm no kayaking expert, but I'm fairly confident that flipping upside down (yes, yes - \"capsizing\") is not good, and that's what just happened to Aleksandra Perova. I'm fairly sure that's good news for Pennie, who's up right now.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>11.04am:</strong> A much better run from Pennie, but she still picked up four seconds in penalties, so it's going to be tight. I'll keep you posted when everyone else has finished, but in the meantime I can tell you that Team GB's three blondes of sailing - Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson have finished second in race seven of the Yngling and remain top of the standing, as does Ben Ainslie in the Finn after a second-place finish of his own. The rest of today's sailing has been postponed due to low visibility.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>11.09am:</strong> It's not looking good for Pennie - she's 15th with two others still to go.</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>11.12am:</strong> Yup, Pennie's out, which is rather disappointing for the woman who was the fifth-highest ranked of any of the entrants into this year's competition. Still, it's not all bad - in a matter of minutes you'll be treated to some superlative web-based text commentary from Howard Swains, who will be taking over this gig as soon as he's done doing whatever it is that he's currently doing.</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>11.15am:</strong> Looks like whatever it is that Howard is doing will take a while longer, so here's an email from a man known only as \"Dave\". \"If only the soft/hand/volleyball was as entertaining as your updates,\" he flatters. \"The Olympic TV coverage (as mentioned at 10am) in SA would have us believe that this is the school-yard world championships. Let the next Olympics get back to reality, chuck the tennis, baseball, football &amp; hockey - we get enough of those already - and just make it 8 days of track &amp; field, swimming, gymnastics and table tennis. OK, and trampoline.\"</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>11.22am:</strong> Those, who - unlike Dave - are feeling starved of football in right now could do a lot worse than perusing <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/13/premier_league_preview_no15_st.html\"> Rob Smyth's excellent Premier League preview piece on Stoke City</a>. Soccerball fans may be more excited/upset to hear that USA are 1-0 down to Nigeria. Holland are currently drawing 0-0 with Japan in the other match in that group, so as it stands both USA and Nigeria go through, but if Holland scored now then USA would be going out.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>11.30am</strong> Right, Howard's here, and I\"m off. Cheers for all your emails - keep sending them on to Howard at <a href=\"mailto:hswains@gmail.com\">hswains@gmail.com</a></p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>11.37am:</strong> Hello folks, this is the first time I've ever been the fourth man in a four-man byline.</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>11.40am:</strong> Sam Morgan from Cardiff gets a mention simply because he's the first into my inbox. \"Where and when will GB win their next medal????\" he asks, the four question marks surprisingly threatening. Well, I don't know when Sam, but I'm confidently predicting Beijing for the where.</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>11.45am:</strong> The television coverage has now moved away from re-runs of the Georgian beach-volleyball victory and into the swimming pool, where they're...swimming. Fran Halsall, of Team GB!, leads after 50m in the 100m freestyle, and she's still there at the end. A heat victory for the Brit, in a time that is described as \"good\".</p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>11.50am:</strong> Kevin Mackenzie, who is one letter away from being the former Sun editor, gotchas: \"Dave's use of the word trampoline (11:15am) has had the effect of my not being able to think about anything but the episode of The Simpsons where Homer buys one but calls it a 'tramamampoline'. Which, now I see them both written down, looks no less ridiculous.\" Funny, because as I read that, I was looking at Sharon Davies on the television, who is kind of Simpson-esque under the peculiar yellow lights in the swimming pool on the telly.</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>11.53am:</strong> The first heats of the women's 100m freestyle are over and Britain's Fran Halsall cruised into the semi-finals fifth fastest. Her sub-54 seconds time is excellent, apparently.</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>11.59am:</strong> As ever at the Games, there are about 30 events going on at any one time which, thanks to the internet, we can know about but struggle to follow with only one pair of eyes. Still, at half-time in the football, Cameroon and Italy are 0-0; Korea lead Honduras 1-0; and Holland lead Japan 1-0. Later on, we've got Ivory Coast v Australia; Argentina v Serbia (remember that match in the World Cup?); China v Brazil; New Zealand v Belgium.</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>12.02pm:</strong> Roger Federer is playing in the tennis at the moment, if anyone is interested in the World No2-elect. The Swiss is a set up but 3-0 down in the second to Tomas Berdych.</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>12.08pm</strong> The men's 200m backstroke heats are underway in the pool, with British hopes lying with Gregor Tait. Meanwhile, Amnat Ruenroeng has just pummeled Jack Willie, from Papua New Guinea, in the boxing, prompting the line: \"Poor little Jack Wille\" from the internet commentator. And repeated here, of course.</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>12.16pm</strong> Gregor Tait finishes second in his heat to Ryan Lochte of the United States, but it's good enough to take him into the semi-finals. Meanwhile, our bloggers have been getting their copy in early, so catch up on <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/13/trials_and_jubilations_for_bri.html\">Richard Williams on Emma Pooley</a>; <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/13/tearful_sacromone_misses_podiu.html\">Sean Ingle on women's gymnastics</a> and <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/13/georgia_and_russia_throw_sand.html\">Lawrence Donegan on the sand storm between Georgia and Russia</a>.</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>12.20pm</strong> Johan van Slooten of the Netherlands has a fact and a question: \"Dutch judo legend,\" (takes his word for it) \"and gold medal winner in Tokyo 1964 Anton Geesink lives in the city of Utrecht, in ... Anton Geesink Street! The street was so named after his win in 1964, and years later Anton actually moved into this street. Is he the only athlete ever to live in his own street?\" That's one for The Knowledge, Olympic edition.*<br>*Does not exist.</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>12.27pm:</strong> Roger Federer is 5-4 down in the second set, but serving. The football matches are now over, I believe, although the official site is struggling to keep up. Holland beat Japan, Nigeria beat USA 2-1 (freeing up Brad Guzan to join up with Villa, I think, since the Americans appear to be out), Korea beat Honduras, and Cameroon drew 0-0 with Pierluigi Casiraghi's Italy.</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>12.36pm:</strong> Kirsty Balfour is up in the 200m breaststroke. No one seems to be expecting much from her, so I'm going to root for the underdog. Roger Federer, meanwhile, is now serving to stay in the second set, ... and succeeds, taking the match to a tiebreak. Balfour, meanwhile, is outside of the top three at 100m.</p> <!-- Block 134 --> <p><strong>12.39pm:</strong> Kirsty Balfour is all but out of the 200m, finishing sixth in her heat. Rebecca Sohn broke the Olympic record, so Balfour had it tough, especially from lane one. She's not officially done, but she's in tears during the post-race interview and \"feels like she's let everyone down\" according to Sharon Davies.</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>12.44pm:</strong> Roger Federer is through to the quarter-finals. He wins the second-set tie-break against Berdych and goes through 6-3, 7-6. Serena Williams is up next, with Jamie and Andy Murray playing in the doubles on an outer court. There's not going to be any telly coverage of that one, apparently, so we'll only be able to bring you the score updates, rather than some more glittering prose.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>12.52pm:</strong> The Olympic football match between China and Brazil is underway, and Brazil have started with Ronaldinho, Lucas and Diego. Manchester United's Dong is playing for China.</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>12.59pm:</strong> Flicking through all these Olympic channels, there's not much chance to follow any event for longer than about five minutes. I'd quite like to watch a bit of that football match, even if Brazil are through to the next round, but there's the men's individual medley heats starting now too. A Ukrainian and a Russian light flyweight are also duffing one another up on another channel, with the Russian on top at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>1.03pm</strong> Britain's Liam Tancock is up in the men's individual medley and finishes fourth, behind Laszlo Cseh. That should be enough to go through.</p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>1.06pm:</strong> Diego has scored for Brazil, giving them a 1-0 lead over China. I missed it, because I was checking in on some badminton, where Denmark and Poland are one game all in the men's doubles.</p> <!-- Block 140 --> <p><strong>1.10pm:</strong> James Goddard is up in heat six of the medley, in which he is blessed just to splutter through the slipstream of the greatest individual that ever lived John Inverdale. I mean Michael Phelps. Phelps won it fairly confidently, but Ryan Lochte in heat five also looked formidable. Godard was fifth and qualified in 13th overall for the semis. Tancock goes through in 14th.</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>1.17pm</strong> Guardian Online Sport Editor Sean Ingle's <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/13/tearful_sacromone_misses_podiu.html\">latest article about women's gymnastics</a> has kicked up some stink in the comments box. Are the competing girls Sindys or not Sindys? Stick your oar in by clicking the link above.</p> <!-- Block 142 --> <p><strong>1.21pm: </strong>The French team breaks the women's 4x200m freestyle relay Olympic record in heat one in the Beijing pool. GB are up in heat two.</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>1.23pm:</strong> Pete Nichols in Beijing is rubbing his hands together over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/13/olympicgames.tennisfederernadal&quot;\">the prospect of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal meeting at the Olympics</a>.</p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>1.33pm:</strong> Incompetent Britain alert! Great Britain's women finish sixth in their heat of the 200m freestyle relay, and spectacularly miss the final after finishing ninth overall. They pay the price for resting the top two swimmers over this distance, presumably for the final that they have now failed to reach. That really is some spectacularly bumbling incompetence from Britain and four red-faced women in swimming suits stare at Sharon Davies's microphone and say they're \"gutted\". No kidding. By their own admission, Jo Jackson, Hannah Miley, Fran Halsall and Melanie Marshall did all they could, but I'm really not sure team GB is strong enough to send out a B-team in any Olympic event.</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>1.38pm:</strong> The French teenager Alize Cornet has shown some youthful impudence to take the first set off Serena Williams in the tennis. She was 5-1 up, was pegged back to 5-3, but served out for the opening set. Meanwhile, some half-time football scores: China 0-1 Brazil; New Zealand 0-1 Belgium; Argentina 1-0 Serbia; Ivory Coast 0-0 Australia.</p> <!-- Block 146 --> <p><strong>1.47pm</strong> The BBC coverage has suddenly become a bit mumsy as Sue Barker welcomes to the studio the British cycling medalists Emma Pooley and Nicole Cooke for some comfortable sofa-based chatter. Also present is Sharon Laws, who can't wear a medal proudly around her neck because she didn't win one. But \"you work as a team\" says Barker, attempting to include Laws, but then follows up with the zinger: \"How did it feel to win your medal, Emma?\"</p> <!-- Block 147 --> <p><strong>1.50pm:</strong> This is what's wrong with British sport: Sue Barker has now just excitedly asked the British cyclists what it's like to be hanging around at the Olympic village and, conspiratorially, \"Come on, who have you seen?\" as though they are stupid little fan girls hanging round hoping for a glimpse of Michael Phelps.</p> <!-- Block 148 --> <p><strong>1.55pm</strong> <em>This</em> is what the Olympics is all about, burly females lifting heavy weights in one swift motion. Yes, it's the women's snatch. (Joke (c) minute-by-minute coverage, London Olympics 1908.)</p> <!-- Block 149 --> <p><strong>2pm:</strong> Some of your emails: \"Re: 1252 entry: Manchester United's Dong? I thought Dion Dublin retired. HONK!\" (Andrew Seaman); \"After looking at the medal table I was curious to find that Russia is only<br>a teaspoonful ahead of the Team GB, so different from memories of the past. Then I did my sums with my 'Coldwar' head on and found that the USSR (if it still existed) would actually be in third place with 5 golds, 11 silvers and 16 bronzes, but still miles behind the new Big Two.\" (Phil Horton, and his coldwar head); \"Does anyone know what happened in the following event: men in the most ludicrous hats I have ever seen cycled alone along public roads, accompanied only by one or two 4WD vehicles, and a British guy (Cummings?) was occasionally indicated to be no. 1, though the commentators said he could not sustain it (or something), but never explained what it was the cyclists were actually trying to achieve (i.e. to win), or what it was that Cummings(?) could or could not sustain - did he win? Or is it still going on, and am I actually for once watching a live, rather than recorded, event on my Philippines Olympic channel?\" (Al Parkes). </p> <p>See what we have to deal with?</p> <!-- Block 150 --> <p><strong>2.05pm:</strong> Serena Williams is battling back into contention in the tennis, and is 4-1 up in the second set. Messrs Murray lost their first set 6-1.</p> <!-- Block 151 --> <p><strong>2.10pm</strong> I've just picked up a feed of the Great Britain men's hockey match against Holland. I'm going to stick with this, only because I really can't trust myself with the women's weightlifting. And it seems I can't trust you lot either, if the smut arriving in my inbox is anything to go by. You know who you are, Alan Varrow.</p> <!-- Block 152 --> <p><strong>2.15pm</strong> OK, so this hockey is delicately poised after Great Britain won their first match but lie behind the hot favourites Australia and today's opponents, Holland. GB have a penalty corner as we first arrive and although they win another attempt with the first effort, the second is squandered. Nil-nil it remains, with 19 minutes remaining in the first period.</p> <!-- Block 153 --> <p><strong>2.17pm</strong>: Brazil go 3-0 up against China in the football, effectively knocking out the hosts (unless they can find four goals in the last 15 minutes). Thiago Neves got the third, drilling it past the despairing dive of the Chinese goalkeeper from 25 yards. He also got the second, although I didn't see it I'm afraid. Still 0-0 in the hockey.</p> <!-- Block 154 --> <p><strong>2.23pm</strong>: I've never experienced the joy of listening to Olympic football on headphones while watching Olympic hockey on the screen. It means that a commentary of \"Ronaldinho, Marcello, Ronaldinho...\" accompanies pictures of (I must admit) unknown men carrying sticks. Another penalty corner for Great Britain, though.</p> <!-- Block 155 --> <p><strong>2.24pm</strong> GB waste the penalty corner as news reaches that Andy and Jamie Murray have crashed out of the tennis in what can only be described as ignominy, 6-1, 6-3 to France's Arnaud Clement and Michael Llodra.</p> <!-- Block 156 --> <p><strong>2.29pm:</strong> Robert van der Horst comes <em>that</em> near to opening the scoring in the hockey as he slices through the GB defence, then lifts the ball over the goalkeeper but onto the post. Still 0-0 but that was dreadful defending from England and a lovely mazy run from the Dutchman.</p> <!-- Block 157 --> <p><strong>2.30pm:</strong> The Olympic hockey, by the way, has meant a return to the BBC commentary box for Barry Davies, who I never really liked during his self-important pomp, but now feel quite sorry for in a sentimental way because Motty got to carry on while he was sent out to pasture. I always preferred Motson back then, when there was something like a media-contrived Blur v Oasis battle between the two of them, but I think I might have been wrong. Davies is quite restrained here, although he's still doing that staccato-style commentary where he says one .... word ... every .... couple ... of ... seconds ... andthengarblesloadsoutallatoncesoyoucannotreallyfollowit.</p> <!-- Block 158 --> <p><strong>2.35pm: </strong>Bouncing round the various wire services (other news providers are available), it seems that Venus Williams is through to the quarter finals of the tennis after beating Victoria Azarenka of Belarus; Argentina beat Serbia in the football; the German handball left back is out of the tournament with a knee injury but countryman Benjamin Kleibrink won a gold medal in the men's individual foil. It's 0-0 at half time in the hockey.</p> <!-- Block 159 --> <p><strong>2.40pm:</strong> And more results: Football: Ivory Coast 1-0 Australia; New Zealand 0-1 Belgium; China 0-3 Brazil (China out). Meanwhile, the heavyweights are in the boxing ring, and the huge Zhanh Zhilei, of China, battered his Moroccan opponent in the first round.</p> <!-- Block 160 --> <p><strong>2.49pm: </strong>A possible minor controversy brewing in the boxing ring, where the Moroccan boxer Amanissi has, as yet, refused to land a punch at Zhanh Zhilei through the first three rounds. Amanissi is 10-0 down and it's a complete mismatch, with the Moroccan passive enough, according to the commentators, that he could be disqualified for his negativity. There's nothing too sinister about it; he's just completely inept and probably shouldn't be there and is now getting booed from the crowd. And that's it, he loses 15-0 and becomes only the second boxer in more than 150 bouts at these Games to fail to trouble the scorers.</p> <!-- Block 161 --> <p><strong>2.53pm:</strong> The hockey is back, and it's been a pretty impressive show from GB, who have held it to 0-0 against the Dutch, who were the runners up in Athens and much-fancied here. Meanwhile, the individual dressage competition is back underway, where there might be an outside medal chance for GB in the form of Jane Gregory.</p> <!-- Block 162 --> <p><strong>2.59pm:</strong> Holland fail to convert a penalty corner -- that's three I've seen now, and no goals. I thought the conversion rate was slightly higher than that, but maybe not. A Dutchman has also just posted a pretty good score in the dressage, apparently, and in the absence of any personal knowledge, I'll believe anything I hear from a plummy-voiced lady representing the British Broadcasting Corporation.</p> <!-- Block 163 --> <p><strong>3.01pm:</strong> Serena Williams has come from behind to beat Alize Cornet and book her place in the quarter-finals of the women's singles tennis. She lost the first set, but ended up winning 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.</p> <!-- Block 164 --> <p><strong>3.10pm:</strong> You can lead a horse to the disco, but you can't make it dance. Or can you? I'll confess I know nothing about dressage, but that's pretty much what this is, right. Dancing horses. Still 0-0 in the hockey.</p> <!-- Block 165 --> <p><strong>3.15pm: </strong>One of the hockey referees is called Grime. Which is kind of noteworthy, if you're trying to text commentate on a 0-0 draw in a game you don't know much about and when the only emails you're getting are correcting (admitedly quite major) typos from earlier posts. Meanwhile, the British player James Tindall has just been sent for a spell on the sidelines for hoiking his stick around an opponent's ankles while he was charging in on goal. That's a foul in any sport. With sticks.</p> <!-- Block 166 --> <p><strong>3.18pm: </strong>And Tindall has been properly punished. His tackle gives the Dutch a penalty corner, which they whip into their dangerman Taeke Taekeme, who slaps it into the bottom corner. The keeper got a touch, but it was far too hard and accurate and Holland now lead 1-0 with about six minutes left.</p> <!-- Block 167 --> <p><strong>3.21pm:</strong> Another penalty corner for the Dutch, this time the result of another crude trip by the British side. This time, though, Wilson in the British goal pulls off a terrific diving save. The dancing horses have a tendency to crash my computer when I try to watch them, so I might hold off for a while.</p> <!-- Block 168 --> <p><strong>3.25pm:</strong> That's it, Holland have won the hockey and Barry Davies is back to his sanctimonious best. The goal was scored \"from a penalty corner given away, quite frankly, needlessly\" he says, and I bet you can just <em>hear</em> his distinctive tones running through that sentence. Great Britain are now third in the standings but have it all to do. They have to beat all the lower ranked countries, then overpower the reigning champions and tournament favourites Australia to progress. Let's face it, it ain't gonna happen.</p> <!-- Block 169 --> <p><strong>3.30pm:</strong> Boxing now -- this is more fun than I could possibly imagine -- as David Price, the super super super heavyweight (6ft 8in, no less), from Liverpool, goes up against Russia's European champion Islam Timurziev. Timurziev is a massive favourite, but Price is simply massive and hops over the ropes in one bound. They're off</p> <!-- Block 170 --> <p><strong>3.35pm: </strong>The first of four two-minute rounds goes to the Russian, 2-0. Price can count himself unlucky not to be only one behind after a decent body blow should definitely have scored, but the judges ruled otherwise. Timurziev's second point comes from the last punch of the round.</p> <!-- Block 171 --> <p><strong>3.40pm:</strong> Wow! Massive upset in the boxing as two huge right-hands from David Price ends this one! The first puts the European champion down on one knee and earns him a standing count, then the Russian walks straight onto another one from the giant Liverpudlian and the referee stops it. Perhaps the decision to stop it was a bit premature, but Price is bounding across the ring and that's a great victory for the Brit. \"Ee never gets knocked out, 'im,\" says Price at the end.</p> <!-- Block 172 --> <p><strong>3.42pm: </strong>That's a terrific result for Price. Timurziev was the favourite for the gold medal, and definitely fancied to beat Price. But the 6ft 8in David slayed the 6ft 2in Goliath, or something, and that's that. Price is through.</p> <!-- Block 173 --> <p>And with that terrific one-two from Price, we're calling this off for the day. Good to finish this watch on a high note, especially after the last-gasp hockey capitulation and the calamitous women's 200m freestyle relay. Thanks for your emails and join us tomorrow at an ungodly hour for more action from Beijing. Goodnight/day/eveing/bye.</p>"
