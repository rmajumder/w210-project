  "<p>Yemen is accused today of unlawfully detaining hundreds of people during a four-year war with rebel forces that the government says ended in the summer.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch urged Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to establish an independent commission to investigate arbitrary arrests and \"disappearances\" and to punish those responsible.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://hrw.org/reports/2008/yemen1008\">HRW report</a> documents 62 cases of unlawful and arbitrary arrest in connection with the conflict in the north of the country that since 2004 has periodically erupted into heavy clashes. </p> <p>Yemeni human rights groups have documented hundreds of arrests, and in August 2008 the government spoke of more than 1,200 political prisoners. The government has detained some individuals as hostages in order to pressure wanted family members to surrender while arresting others for publicizing government abuses during the conflict.</p> <p>President Saleh declared an end to fighting in the northern Sa'da governorate in mid-July and in August and September he ordered some prisoners released. But dozens remain detained without charge or trial, and some are still unaccounted for.</p> <p>\"Dozens of people who committed no crime are still languishing in Yemeni prisons, months after the president promised to deal with their cases,\" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. \"Some family members still don't know if their loved ones who were 'disappeared' are dead or alive.\"</p> <p>Yemen, the poorest and most remote of all Arab countries, is a key US ally in the \"war on terror\" and is fighting its own war against al-Qaida groups. But the fighting between Huthi rebels and the government in Sa'da attracted very little outside attention, despite accusations that Saudi Arabia and Iran were involved.</p> <p>The rebels began as a religious revivalist movement, the Believing Youth, in the 1990s under the leadership of Husain al-Huthi. They are followers of Zaidi Islam, a branch of Shiism found mainly in Yemen, and sought to counter growing fundamentalist Sunni trends. They began fighting in 2004 after the central government in Sana'a closed their religious schools.</p> <p>HRW said those arrested include people who did not actively participate in hostilities. Some were effectively held hostage to pressure a wanted family member to surrender. They also include people whom the security forces targeted for their religious activism.</p> <p>\"Over the decade preceding the outbreak of the conflict, Yemen made some advances in the rule of law, especially by setting out rights in the constitution and other legislation, such as the penal code and criminal procedure code,\" said HRW. \"However, these have been eroded by hundreds of enforced disappearances and arbitrary arrests, mainly in the context of the Huthi rebellion but also relating to the government's domestic counter-terrorism efforts and its crackdown on social unrest in southern Yemen.\"</p>",
  "<p>Over the past few days, a music video entitled Red, White and Milf (short for \"Mom I'd like to fuck\") has appeared all over the internet. It features a cowboy singing a novelty song about Sarah Palin (\"she came to us from the hills of Wasilla / the babes are hot, but the winters are a killer\"), while three women resembling the Republican vice-presidential candidate dance in skimpy outfits in the background. Actually, dancing is the least of it. One runs her tongue along the barrel of a rifle, one whips another with a US flag, one dips her finger into a pie and feeds it to another, before smearing it over the woman's face and licking it off. It's a lot of suggestion, basically, leading to the moment when the cowboy opens a beer, holds it to his crotch and sprays it over the three women. They respond - how else? - by smearing it ecstatically across their chests.</p> <p>For better or worse (I would say the latter), Palin is the highest-profile female politician in the world now, which makes the constant objectification of her particularly galling. This began within days of her nomination, of course, when doctored pictures of her showed up on the internet, head superimposed on to a rifle-toting model in a stars-and-stripes bikini. At the same time, a company started manufacturing a \"naughty schoolgirl\" Palin doll.</p> <p>More recently, \"sexy Sarah Palin\" Halloween costumes, featuring said bikini, have been selling on Amazon, a Palin blow-up doll has been created (\"bypass the Bush and have some Milf\", reads a tag line), and this week Larry Flynt, the founder of the Hustler empire, released a teaser for his porn film Who's Nailin' Palin? There's also a website devoted entirely to memorabilia stamped with Palin's face and the acronym VPILF (you can work that one out) - which includes, jarringly, a maternity T-shirt.</p> <p>There hasn't been a huge backlash to this, perhaps partly because it's been happening outside the mainstream media and partly because McCain's running partner is such a difficult person for women to defend - especially when the political stakes are so vertiginously high. While Palin calls herself a feminist - \"a sign of perverse progress\", sighs the pioneering US writer Robin Morgan - her views exist at a frightening distance from any recognisable women's rights agenda. In a disastrous interview on CBS, for instance, Palin was asked by the presenter Katie Couric: \"If a 15-year-old is raped by her father, do you believe it should be illegal for her to get an abortion?\" She answered: \"I would counsel to choose life.\" When Palin was mayor of Wasilla, the town defied a bill by the then governor of Alaska that local law enforcement should pay for the forensic kits used to collect evidence from rape victims; instead, in a state where the rates of rape are 2.5 times the national average, the victims were being expected to stump up \u00a3185-\u00a3750 to have evidence collected. (Palin's spokeswoman has suggested she didn't know about this; former state representative, Eric Croft, has said he finds this hard to believe.) She is also against same-sex marriage; in the circumstances, defending her sticks in any feminist's craw.</p> <p>But as the attacks on her have grown, they have come to seem more and more disturbing. This is partly because - like many of the sexist attacks on Hillary Clinton during the primaries - they have come from people who would usually consider themselves progressive. On the liberal Huffington Post website, for instance, one blogger wrote: \"Basically, I want to have sex with [Palin] on my Barack Obama sheets while my wife reads from the Constitution.\" Great.</p> <p>One person who has been speaking out against the trend is the feminist writer Melissa McEwan, who blogs at Shakesville (other websites that have addressed it are feministing.com and feministe.us). She's been conducting a \"Sarah Palin sexism watch\", and says that \"the most depressing thing has been to see not just conservatives being misogynist, but progressives too. People who are ostensibly supposed to be feminist see no problem with saying: 'Well, because I don't agree with her politics, it's OK to use misogyny against her.'\" </p> <p>McEwan defends Palin because she recognises that these attacks have a huge knock-on effect on women in general - as Morgan says: \"Even in this case, where I disagree with the politics of the individual, the contempt shown for her, even when it's expressed in the form of a compliment ('I'd like to fuck her'), spills over on to all women.\" </p> <p>Taken with the sexist attacks on Clinton, this underlines the fact that any woman entering public life runs the risk of being reduced to the most basic female stereotype that springs to mind - in Clinton's case it was the ball breaker (nutcrackers were produced in her image); in Palin's case, the porn star. </p> <p>McEwan says she has had emails from women saying: \"'You know, I used to think about going into politics, but now I see stuff like this, and I think there's no way.' ... It's basically saying, we're going to require you to have skin so thick that you're going to have to put up with this - and that's a misogyny tax. You're literally being taxed for being a woman.\" She has also looked at the treatment of Margaret Thatcher and Geraldine Ferraro during their campaigns and found similar incidents, although \"it wasn't so pornified\".</p> <p>Morgan says she's \"not surprised, but I am astonished\" that such attacks are still made on female politicians, and believes that it will only be when there are as many women as men in politics, \"as many women presidents; as many women in real positions of power in business, in politics, in the media, that this will change\".</p> <p>For now, while every feminist I know is praying that Obama is bound for the White House, it also seems relevant to puncture and attack these misogynist slurs - not for Palin's sake, but for the sake of every woman who one day hopes to follow her into public life.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Friday October 31 2008</strong></p> <p> Our calculation of the chances of four out of five US presidents being left-handed was slightly awry in the article below. We gave the probability as 0.00009, given that one in 10 of the population is left-handed. That is the probability of any particular sequence of one right-handed and four left-handed presidents. The odds of that occurring in any order would be 0.00045</p> <p> </p> <p>Amid the many conspiracy theories swirling around the US presidential race - Barack Hussein Obama's Islamist takeover, say, or John \"Bush\" McCain's plans to steal the election - a truly sinister confluence of events has largely gone unnoticed.</p> <p>Some see the devil's hand at play in an election that, whatever the outcome, will see America make a a fundamental shift, not from right to left, but from right-handed to left-handed.</p> <p>Both Obama and McCain are sinistral - lefties to you and me - in contrast to the present incumbent of the Oval office. One of them will be the fourth left-handed president out of the five past holders of the world's most powerful office, a fact that has intrigued neurologists and confounded probability theorists.</p> <p>Obama or McCain will become the 44th US president, and within that distinguished company will be the eighth known to be left-handed. The victor will become the sixth lefty out of 12 presidents since the end of the second world war, stretching back to Harry Truman.</p> <p>The other postwar lefties-in-chief are Gerald Ford, the ambidextrous Ronald Reagan, George Bush Sr and Bill Clinton. Since 1974 the only right-handed presidents have been Jimmy Carter and the outgoing Bush.</p> <p>Roughly one in 10 of the population is left-handed, so to have four out of five recent incumbents in the top job drawn from that group is striking: the probability is 0.00009.</p> <p>Some statisticians would say it is just a coincidence that over time will be evened out. Certainly, the prevalence has been lower among the 12 postwar British prime ministers; only two of them, Churchill and Callaghan, were left-handed. But Daniel Geschwind, a professor of human genetics at UCLA, thinks it is beyond coincidence.</p> <p>\"Six out of the past 12 presidents is statistically significant, and probably means something,\" he said.</p> <p>Membership of the rarefied group also extends across the political divide and into US public life. Apart from Obama and McCain, it includes the TV mogul Oprah Winfrey, the Nobel peace prize laureate Al Gore, New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and Homer Simpson's neighbour Ned Flanders.</p> <p>Geschwind points out that there are established differences in brain patterns. The language function lies in the left hemisphere of the brain for 98% of right-handed people, but is on the left for only about 60% of left-handers. About 10% of lefties have their language function on the right hemisphere - far more than their right-handed brethren - and about 30% straddle both sides.</p> <p>How these factors play out in practice is only thinly understood, but it may help to explain why there are a disproportionate number of left-handed maths professors at MIT, for instance, as well as artists from Michelangelo to Paul Klee, not to mention Winfrey, Gore and Bloomberg.</p> <p>Left-handed US presidents go back to James Garfield, who, legend has it, could write in Latin with one hand and simultaneously write the same sentence in Greek with the other.</p> <p>The rollcall has not always been a happy one. Garfield was assassinated in 1881 (though the assumption that left-handed people are prone to an early grave has been debunked). Herbert Hoover was the second confirmed left- handed US president, and we know all too well what happened under him.</p> <p>Fidel Castro is also a member of the club, as is Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>Over the centuries, southpaws, as they have been known since the early days of baseball - have had a rough ride. Etymology tells the story. \"Sinister\" comes from the Latin word for left, later taking on the connotation of evil or unlucky.</p> <p>According to the Left-Handers Club, a support group based in Surrey, the Devil is almost always portrayed as left-handed. The basics of life, from desks to scissors and computer mouses, are geared to the right-handed majority. Which is why Ned Flanders in the TV series The Simpsons set up a shop called the Leftorium.</p> <p>Kristy Ainslie, a biomedical engineer in San Francisco, knows all about these inconveniences from personal experience. Eight months ago she set up a Facebook group, Lefties for Obama, partly as a satire on the way Obama has been depicted as someone outside the mainstream.</p> <p>She thinks there may be something to the presidential cluster of lefties: \"When you are left-handed you have your own unique perspective and have to be willing to stand out from the crowd. That's not bad training for a president.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Ed Pilkington is right-handed</p>",
  "<p>One day in 1957, six-year-old Steve Stein was sitting with his mother in a Chinese restaurant in Mount Vernon, New York, when a record came on the jukebox that would ignite a lifelong passion for making familiar music sound fresh and strange. It was a single called The Flying Saucer by a pair of enterprising pranksters called Dickie Goodman and Bill Buchanan. Using a reel-to-reel tape recorder, they had constructed a spoof narrative about a UFO landing in Times Square, creating dialogue by taking lines from rock'n'roll records. It sold a million copies and prompted an industry lawsuit citing no fewer than 19 copyright infringements, thus making Goodman and Buchanan trailblazers not just in the field of sampling, but in the field of sampling-related litigation. </p> <p>The kid, who would later become a pivotal figure in the history of sampling under the name Steinski, was impressed. \"I still remember hearing it and thinking: What the hell is this?,\" says Stein. \"I thought: Damn, that's really crazy. That's really cool.\" </p> <p>Twenty-six years later, Stein, by then a Madison Avenue copywriter, entered a competition to remix a single on hip-hop label Tommy Boy. With sound engineer Douglas Di Franco, aka Double Dee, Stein spent 14 hours creating Lesson 1: The Payoff Mix, a playful, wildly imaginative collage that made bed-fellows of Little Richard, Grandmaster Flash, Humphrey Bogart and former New York mayor Fiorello La Guardia. It was really crazy. It was really cool. It won the contest, set a new benchmark for sampling and influenced generations of producers from Coldcut and M/A/R/R/S to DJ Shadow and the Avalanches. </p> <p>Double Dee &amp; Steinski made four more mixes together, themed around James Brown, or jazz, or classic hip-hop breakbeats, and Steinski has been producing records on and off ever since. None of them, however, could be officially released. For years, they circulated under the radar, but now a compilation of his work, What Does It All Mean?, has appeared on Illegal Art, a copyright-challenging US label run by a mysterious character who calls himself Philo T Farnsworth, after the inventor of the first totally electronic television. The same label is home to one of Steinski's spiritual heirs, Girl Talk, whose albums smash together fragments of famous pop records at bewildering speed, earning rave reviews from critics and remix offers from the likes of Beck and Peter, Bjorn &amp; John. </p> <p>The art of sampling has always kept lawyers busy. During the late 1980s, albums such as De La Soul's 3 Feet High and Rising and the Beastie Boys' Paul's Boutique looted pop's toy chest for booty and assembled their findings with breathtaking ingenuity and a cavalier disregard for copyright. But it couldn't last. In a landmark 1991 case, singer-songwriter Gilbert O'Sullivan successfully sued rapper Biz Markie over an unlicensed sample of his hit Alone Again (Naturally), and the free-for-all was over. Cautious hip-hop producers now base tracks on just one or two cleared samples, while prolific samplers such as DJ Shadow and the Avalanches root through charity-shop bins for obscure source material that won't incur punitive licensing costs. </p> <p>But there is a school of sampling that makes illegality a point of principle. In 1985, Canadian sound artist John Oswald coined the word \"plunderphonics\" to describe the art of flagrant sampling. \"Taking Madonna singing Like a Virgin and rerecording it backwards or slower is plunderphonics, as long as you can reasonably recognise the source,\" he explained. \"The plundering has to be blatant.\" He summed up his philosophy thus: \"If creativity is a field,copyright is the fence.\" </p> <p>The spirit of plunderphonics spread to the likes of San Francisco's Negativland, who incurred the wrath of U2's label with their parodic U2 EP; the KLF (Kopyright Liberation Front), whose sample-stuffed debut album was binned after a legal battle with ABBA; Gnarls Barkley's Danger Mouse, who received a cease-and-desist order after combining Jay-Z and the Beatles on The Grey Album; and mash-up producers such as Freelance Hellraiser and Richard X, both of whom have since gone legit. In each case, blatancy is the point. Steinski sampled legendary newscaster Walter Cronkite's coverage of the murder of John F Kennedy on his 1987 record The Motorcade Sped On. CBS refused to license the clips: \"I called this guy and described what I wanted to do and he gave a little snort and said, 'There's no way in hell that we'll clear that.' And he just hung up.\" But Steinski pressed ahead with the Cronkite option because \"you want the thing; you don't want the almost-thing\". </p> <p>Wanting \"the thing\" is fundamental to Girl Talk, aka 26-year-old Gregg Gillis. \"I was taking a Warhol approach,\" he says. \"I didn't want to go crate-digging, searching for the obscure sample.\" If you knew nothing of pop history and heard devoted crate-digger DJ Shadow's Endtroducing album, you would still get out of it everything that Shadow intended to convey, but much of the pleasure of Girl Talk's records stems from recognition. \"I always wanted to use recognisable elements and play with people's emotional, nostalgic connections with these songs,\" says Gillis. \"For me the biggest challenge is to make transformative new music out of these huge musical parts that anyone can recognise.\" Gillis's breakneck sampling makes a case for the common language of pop. By splicing Elton John with the Notorious BIG, or Jay-Z with Radiohead, he celebrates the curious democracy of the Top 40 world. \"It's a fun game of running through the forest of the history of pop music.\" </p> <p>Of course, to make that point requires plundering records so famous that he could never clear them all. \"To pay every artist on the record I'd probably have to sell each album for a few hundred pounds. When I started doing this music I wasn't intending to be an outlaw - I just liked sample-based music. Every band is rehashing ideas from the past, and you can use a sampler or computer as an instrument. To me that's no different from the Rolling Stones being influenced by classic blues guitarists. I feel that it should be legal.\" </p> <p>Stein, too, would be legit in an ideal world. \"If the money and the means had been there I would have done it legally,\" he says. \"Being a romantic copyright criminal is interesting considering the fact I've led a rather sheltered life. To the extent that I feel that I have any purpose on earth it's to make these goddamn records. That it's against the law is completely off to one side.\" </p> <p>Whether these records really are against the law is some-thing of a grey area. When Dickie Goodman and Bill Buchanan were sued a second time in 1957, a judge decided that their records fell under the principle of \"fair use\", because they had \"created a new work\". Conceived as a defence of free speech, fair use in the US allows unauthorised use of copy-righted material if it is \"transformative\", such as a quote from a book in a review, or an artistic parody, and therefore sufficiently different as not to hurt sales of the original work. Gillis insists his albums are transformative - if anything, his albums stimulate interest in the original songs - but fair use is a nebulous concept subject to the discretion of individual judges. Current copyright law does not officially recognise the art of sampling. </p> <p>That may change. Last year, much to his surprise, Gillis found himself being mentioned in Congress. Representative Mike Doyle, who represents Gillis's hometown of Pittsburgh, brought up Girl Talk during a House of Representatives subcommittee hearing on the future of radio. \"Maybe mash-ups are transformative new art that expands the consumers' experience and doesn't compete with what an artist has made available on iTunes or at the CD store,\" he suggested. </p> <p>A measure of the record industry's apparent change of heart is the fact that, despite Girl Talk's new album being described by the New York Times as \"a lawsuit waiting to happen\", neither his record nor Steinski's have been the subject of legal action. There is a strong, practical reason for this reluctance to sue. In an era of file sharing, YouTube and freely available remix software, pursuing individual producers for copyright infringement would be like patching up hairline cracks in a dam that already has gaping holes in it. \"Technology has absolutely blown this thing out of the tub,\" says Stein. \"When some cat with a laptop can take all the music he wants, mix it up, post it on YouTube and then go to school, then they're not going to have much luck [suing].\" But it's worth noting that if the internet currently enjoys the exhilarating freedom of 80s hip-hop, then it's possible that an equivalent of the Biz Markie ruling might one day bring the shutters clanging down. </p> <p>What does it all mean? It means that every internet user can now access the technology, if not the imagination, necessary to be a Steinski or a Girl Talk. More and more consumers of art have the means and, they believe, the right to become active participants in it, by recontextualising songs or images. In 1986, critic Robert Christgau described Steinski as \"a perpetually disillusioned optimist who still assumes that the sounds and images rippling through the American consciousness are, forget copyright, every American's birthright - that we're all free to interpret and manipulate them as we choose.\" Back then, Steinski and John Oswald were, their different ways, fighting a lonely fight. In 2008, they have a lot of company. </p> <p>\u2022 What Does It All Mean?: 1983-2006 Retrospective by Steinski and Feed the Animals by Girl Talk are out now on Illegal Art</p>",
  "<p>Marc Forster remembers his response when his agent told him he was in line to direct the 22nd James Bond film: \"No, no, no, no, no.\" The 39-year-old, German-born filmmaker squeezes out an incredulous laugh. \"I said, 'They've got the wrong director.'\" You take the point. A long, hard stare at his CV - which ranges from the intensity of Monster's Ball to the winsome Finding Neverland and the smartypants comedy Stranger Than Fiction - reveals nothing to suggest an aptitude for mildly fogeyish, espionage-based escapism.</p> <p>And yet here he is, 18 months later, discussing the 22nd James Bond film. Precisely how many razor-sharp bowler hats, switchblade shoes and genital thrashings was he threatened with before he signed on the dotted line? Actually, Forster experienced nothing more torturous than a charm offensive from Barbara Broccoli, one of the most tenacious producers ever to share a name with a vegetable.</p> <p>\"Even so, I kept thinking: What's the upside here?\" he says, averting his eyes from the open laptop on the coffee table before him, which lends his features a faint, blue glow. A silent assistant with an air of Rosa Klebb about her taps at another keyboard on the other side of the room, making me wonder if she's feeding Forster his answers. \"I'm at a point in my career where I can make the mid-budget movies I want to make. I have creative freedom, final cut, and now they're offering me a $200m movie? If it's a failure, it could harm my career. And if it's a success, the only advantage is I can make more blockbusters. Do I really want that? I don't think so!\" He scoffs at the idea. With his floodlight eyes and enormous hairless head, he momentarily resembles a surly baby. </p> <p>The clincher for Forster was talking things over with Daniel Craig, the man who should be praised for bringing the first hint of nastiness to Bond, and blamed for causing an unhealthy upswing in the wearing of Speedos. \"Daniel and I are very much in sync; he's a highly intelligent and sensitive actor. His achievement has been to humanise Bond, so that he could be one of us - not a hero, but an antihero with a dark side. Meeting him made me want to jump in, take the risk.'\"</p> <p>On the minus side, there was still the matter of the film's title - it didn't have one. \"When I signed on, we had a release date but no script and no title,\" he says with a disbelieving laugh. During pre-production, Broccoli and her co-producer Michael G Wilson summoned Forster to their office, where a poster, emblazoned with the proposed title, was laid out for his inspection. It would be fair to say that his immediate reaction foreshadowed that of fans the world over, many of whom were left marveling that the accolade of Worst Ever Bond Title had been stolen at last from Octopussy, while at the same time wondering how on earth anyone was supposed to mime Quantum of Solace in a game of charades.</p> <p>\"That's the title?\" he spluttered. </p> <p>\"Well - what do you think?\" asked Broccoli. </p> <p>\"Er, I'm not sure,\" Forster replied. \"Where is this going?\"</p> <p>He says he grew accustomed to the title after a while. Now he even claims to love it. \"At least it created discussion,\" he points out. Yes, but so did foot-and-mouth.</p> <p>When we meet, Forster is still cutting the picture together, and is showing the strain of a punishing schedule which has left him with five weeks to complete editing compared to his usual 14. \"It's the way Barbara and Michael work,\" he sighs. \"I think it's to minimise studio interference. I can't think of any other reason to impose such a horrible deadline.\"</p> <p>He has been hidden from natural light for weeks on end, and is consequently unaware that Jack White, who wrote the film's theme song, Another Way to Die, on which he duets with Alicia Keys, has complained about it being used first on the new Coke Zero ad campaign. \"I haven't heard about this ... What exactly happened?\" Forster shoots a nervous glance at Rosa Klebb, who doesn't look up from her laptop. And what of the Amy Winehouse number that was originally intended as the new Bond theme? \"Oh, Amy never recorded anything. We had a meeting. I don't think she was feeling so well.\" Nice euphemism, I say. He laughs cheekily.</p> <p>Winehouse's fluctuating health was one of the milder problems to hit the production. More worrying were the stunts that went spectacularly wrong, including a crash near Lake Garda that left the stunt driver Aris Comninos in hospital. There were also reports that the Bolivian government complained about the film \"stereotyping\" its people, while shooting in Chile hit a snag when a town mayor objected to the disruption. Forster has dealt with worse. On his previous movie, The Kite Runner, he directed a foreign cast entirely through interpreters, then watched as his young performers were forced to flee their homes after accusations that the film had denigrated Afghan culture. Compared to that, he says, making Quantum of Solace was a breeze.</p> <p>While he is diffident by nature, he can't quite conceal his pride at the film. \"It's in good shape,\" he says. The wham-bam 20-minute excerpt that I see the night before we meet suggests a sun-baked travelogue, visiting Italy, Mexico, Panama and others, interspersed with outbreaks of hand-to-hand combat, not unlike switching back and forth between Captain Corelli's Mandolin and Fist of Fury. The picture begins at the end of Casino Royale, as Bond's search for his lover's murderers drives him on to ever more brutal methods that impinge on his professional duties. He hooks up with Camille (Olga Kurylenko), who is on her own revenge mission, and confronts the businessman Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric), whose environmental concerns provide a front for more disreputable practices.</p> <p>Having subsequently seen the completed film, it is evident that Forster was nobody's puppet: Quantum of Solace, which is as short and sharp as its title is woolly, evokes the Ken Adams-designed techno-retro look of Goldfinger and You Only Live Twice, while pushing the series, and Bond's persona, toward more morally ambivalent waters. But after the turgid ruminations of, say, The Dark Knight, do we need another hero with a perpetually furrowed brow?</p> <p>\"Times have changed,\" he insists. \"People don't identify any more with a pure hero. They identify with somebody broken.\" Here I begin to understand what it was that overrode Forster's reservations about making the film, even more than his kinship with Craig. \"All my movies have some connection to me. Each of my protagonists is emotionally repressed. That was my 'in' to the project. Bond is an outcast. He can't open up. He's vulnerable beneath his hard shell. I need to connect with all my characters in that way; a film can only work for me if I incorporate something personal.\"</p> <p>Without wishing to insult him, I point out gently that he appears to have owned up to being a repressed misfit. That's when he sketches in his background for me: how his father, the head of a pharmaceutical firm, sold his company when Forster was three years old, leaving the family extravagantly wealthy. After the sale was splashed across the German media, the family became targets for the Baader-Meinhof group, who issued kidnapping threats, prompting the Forsters to hurriedly relocate to the Swiss ski resort of Davos.</p> <p>\"I wasn't aware of the danger,\" Forster says. \"I just knew I was part of a wealthy family. One of the reasons I was an outcast in Davos, and played alone all the time, was because I grew up around farmers, who led a very plain life. They knew I was rich, which meant I could never fit in.\" </p> <p>But when Forster was 17, his father lost everything. \"It was the best thing that could've happened. It forced me to find the discipline to follow my dream. Between the ages of 17 and 31, I was so poor. But I had nothing to lose. Nothing!\" He is practically whooping. \"Can you imagine? That means no one can take anything away from you.\"</p> <p>Even now, he keeps his life as pared-down as possible. He lives in Los Angeles, but avoids the social scene. He hikes, he swims. And, as you'd expect from a man whose childhood was shaped by a piercing awareness of wealth and its consequences, he never does anything for the money. </p> <p>\"When I got the call to do Bond, I warned my agent, 'Don't tell me what they're offering.' I didn't want it to affect my decision.\" I was going to say that I hoped he would make a film about his feelings of isolation, purity and self-sufficiency. But, in Quantum of Solace, he seems to have done just that.</p> <p>\u2022 Quantum of Solace is released October 31</p>",
  "<p>A key prosecution witness in the Rhys Jones trial told police that the murder weapon had been hidden in a loft at his home, a court was told yesterday. The 17-year-old boy, who cannot be identified, was giving evidence in the trial of Sean Mercer, 18, an alleged member of the Crocky Crew gang, who denies murder.</p> <p>The jurors at Liverpool crown court yesterday watched video recordings of police interviews with the teenager, who has been given immunity from prosecution in exchange for his evidence.</p> <p>He told police that Mercer gave him the pistol just 20 minutes after Rhys was shot dead near the Fir Tree pub in Croxteth Park, Liverpool, on August 22 last year. He said he took the gun, wrapped up in a carrier bag, and hid it under blankets in the dog kennel in the garden of his home. </p> <p>The teenager said five days later, one of Mercer's co-defendants, a 16-year-old, who is accused of assisting an offender, came to his house and asked for the gun. The witness said: \"He said, 'I've come to move that'. I said, 'Go on then, move it. I don't want to be involved in any of this'.\" </p> <p>The 16-year-old asked for a bag and went into the garden. When he came back in, he used the boy's phone and asked someone: \"What do we do now?\"</p> <p>Two minutes later, he returned to the house. \"He said he was going to put it in my loft and I said, 'No you're not, I don't want anything to do with it. I'm not getting involved in all of this'. </p> <p>\"I was thinking, what's he putting in the loft? It could be anything. He climbed up into the loft. I could hear some rustling. Then he came down and left.\" </p> <p>The witness's home was later raided by police and, the prosecution says, the .455 Smith and Wesson revolver was found hidden in the loft. </p> <p>Asked about the gangs, he said he \"heard people talking they are fighting over drugs and that\". He knew a few young members of the Nogga Dogz who were \"trying to be wannabes\" but denied he was in a gang.</p> <p>The boy had been holidaying with his family in Florida in September last year when police raided his home. He was arrested on arrival back in the UK. </p> <p>The boy said he saw Mercer on Christmas Day. \"He said he had heard my mum had not been well and he said to tell her he was sorry. He asked if I was all right. He said he hoped I hadn't moved far and told me not to keep looking over my shoulder. He said 'don't think they're following you because they're not'.\" </p> <p>The teenager said he thought he had been \"used ... as a safe house or something because I've never been in trouble with the police and I don't go out.\" He was scared to say no \"because you think to yourself, 'Well, he might have done that to a little kid, so what could he do to me?'\" </p> <p>The trial continues.</p>",
  "<p>In an age when the Conservative party was still seeking to rid itself of a gentry, military and City image, David Evans, who has died aged 73, became an emblematic figure. Born of working-class stock in Edmonton, the son of a postman, he had failed the 11-plus and spoke in an unapologetically east London half-snarl/half-gurgle. But he was also a self-made businessman to the tune of \u00a332m, and a Thatcherite of Thatcherites. His election as MP for Welwyn Hatfield in 1987 was the ultimate breakthrough for his party.</p> <p>Evans's own career entitled him to euphoria. After leaving Raglan Road school and Tottenham Technical College, he had been a professional cricketer with Gloucestershire and Warwickshire, though he never made the first team. He had also played football for Aston Villa, again without making any first-team appearances. But in 1960 he founded a contract cleaning company, Exclusive Office Cleaning (it later became Brengreen Holdings). A natural beneficiary of the scrapping of direct labour forces, the company won the contract to collect refuse and clean the streets of Southend-on-Sea, and became a brilliant success, employing at its peak 30,000 people. Evans sold it just before he entered parliament, after the local party lost confidence in his predecessor, Christopher Murphy. </p> <p>At Westminster, Evans's business instincts could lead him into shrewd judgments, such as his objection to the 1987 takeover of British Caledonian by British Airways as being prejudicial to competition. Equally creditably, he spoke with scorn of Treasury-led, small-calibration fusspotting over MPs' salaries, refusing to vote in 1987 on the nervous proposal of \u00a318,000, calling it \"an absolute joke, not enough to support a family or live the life that was expected\". It should be \u00a350,000 or nothing, he said. He was also untouched by the Catholic lobby on abortion, opposing David Alton's 1988 restrictions bill. </p> <p>At his best, Evans favoured whatever worked, a fruitful sort of Conservatism. But like so many plain, blunt men spoiling real talent, he was vulnerable to self-parody, particularly in the way he expressed his rightwing views with brutal enthusiasm. If there is such a thing as a moderate flogger, it wasn't Evans, who could be heard calling for the cat o' nine tails. His roughneck style touched most subjects: \"I don't trust Russians; the more nuclear weapons the better,\" \"I'm a very rightwing disciplinarian\" and \"under [Edward] Heath, the Tories were all stockbrokers and landed gentry.\"</p> <p>His outlook was seamlessly authoritarian; bad things should be stopped by whatever means would do the trick. Though he never used the expression \"airy-fairy human rights talk\", there was an pre-echo of David Blunkett there, and indeed Evans was an early apostle of the identity card. He made his chief impact advocating a specialised application of this police state tool. </p> <p>Maintaining his interest in sport, he became chairman of Luton Town FC in 1984. With football hooliganism a real evil at international and domestic level - and a source of tabloid paranoia - he had the answer. All matches should be 100% members only, with membership serving as a self-contained identity card.</p> <p>It was an idea perfectly tailored to Margaret Thatcher's impulse to find out what Jimmy was doing and tell him he mustn't. The objections - that the majority of clubs with no hooliganism would have to jump through this hoop and lose money by it, that the police thought it impractical and the judiciary a catch-all prejudgment, and the fact that casual attenders would now be excluded from games, finally won the day. But this crude piece of unConservative central control was a serious runner at the time. </p> <p>Evans had not applied his formidable business sense to working out the longer-term consequences of a scheme with gut appeal, and such emotional responses would betray him on other occasions. There are rightwing Conservatives who, arguing their case rationally, retain the regard of the left; Sir Teddy Taylor is a good example. But Evans's emotions ran away with him. His use of language also got him into trouble. In 1997, he described his unmarried opponent in Welwyn, Melanie Johnson, later a Blairite junior minister, as \"a single girl\" with \"three bastard children\". In the event, Welwyn elected the scarlet woman with a majority of 6,000, and Evans returned to his business interests, retiring in 2002. </p> <p>His years in parliament had seen him rise to only the lowest ministerial level, parliamentary private secretary, in a wide range of ministries - at the Department of Trade and Industry (1990-92), the Department of the Environment (1992-93) and the Welsh Office (1993). He is survived by his wife Janice, whom he married in 1955, two sons and a daughter.</p> <p>\u2022 David John Evans, politician and businessman, born April 23 1935; died October 22 2008</p>",
  "<p>Property markets may be crashing worldwide, but in the world of New York real estate one building remains apparently untouched: 740 Park Avenue.</p> <p>This week Courtney Ross, widow of the funeral parlour director-turned legendary Time Warner entertainment mogul Steve Ross, quietly put her 32-room apartment in 740 on the market for in excess of $60m (\u00a337m).</p> <p>\"It's going to be the most expensive apartment ever sold in New York,\" predicted the sales agent. The property, Edward Lee Cave said, was not officially for sale and would be shown to just 10 prospective buyers \"because there will only be 10 people who are appropriate to see it\".</p> <p>The building is considered so exclusive that last year it saw the publication of its own biography, 740 Park: The Story of the World's Richest Apartment Building, by the New York society writer Michael Gross.</p> <p>Indeed, the building - described as the \"noblest of all\" New York apartment buildings by Vanity Fair - is a road map of American wealth and society since it was built in 1929.</p> <p>Where it was once home to Vanderbilts, Rockefellers and Chryslers - Jackie Kennedy, then Bouvier, grew up there - it now houses the new-monied elite of banking, hedge funds and private equity: Henry Kravis, David Ganek, Saul Steinberg, John Thain and Stephen Schwarzman.</p> <p>The Ross apartment, while not considered the most elegant, is the largest in the building. But scraping together $60m plus is no guarantee of entry. Under New York's co-op vetting system, applicants will have to go undergo rigorous background checks. At a minimum, a buyer must put at least half down in cash and prove he or she is liquid to at least three times the total value of the sale - and that's even before a stringent social evaluation is undertaken by the building's board members.</p> <p>While the rest of Manhattan considers a property crash - as many as 80,000 luxury flats were built during the boom and hardly any are selling - agents are confident the Ross apartment will find a buyer. \"It's not going to be 'at least' $60m,\" Cave said. \"It will be over $60m.\"</p> <p>But with money fleeing collapsing hedge funds and private equity firms forced to write down the value of their assets, the mood in the city's rich addresses is souring.</p> <p>\"I've never seen a mood quite like this one,\" Holly Peterson, daughter of the Manhattan private equity king Pete Peterson, noted in Newsweek last week. \"Everyone is just plain scared, but no one is talking specifics. </p> <p>\"The thing about rich people is you never know exactly how rich they are or where their money is.\"</p>",
  "<p>Jonathan Woodgate, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenhamhotspur\">Tottenham Hotspur's</a> senior player, said last night that the team were worse than his old club <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/leedsunited\">Leeds United</a>, after defeat by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese\">Udinese</a> kept the London side in free fall. \"We are worse than Leeds [when they were relegated in 2004] at the moment and we need a kick up the arse,\" said the defender. \"It's mental and physical. If you don't have a winning mentality you have a losing mentality, and we've got that at the moment.</p> <p>\"We've got to get stuck in and start winning games. We've got to start learning and concentrating. We've got to start grafting. We've got to stand up now, but it's going to be hard. We're rudderless at the moment.\"</p> <p>The manager, Juande Ramos, blamed his goalkeeper, Heurelho Gomes, for the mistake which led to defeat in northern Italy. Spurs also had their midfielder Jamie O'Hara sent off and conceded another penalty - they have now had three red cards and given away three spot-kicks in two matches.</p> <p>Ramos said: \"I'm angry because I don't like to lose. The error by the goalkeeper changed the game in the wrong direction. Now we have to win if we are going to qualify for the next phase.</p> <p>\"The first half we played OK but the mistake and the goal changed the game in totally the wrong direction. It is difficult to win games if you don't score goals.\"</p> <p>He said Gomes's howler was crucial. \"It was a bad mistake but it is part of football. I am still supportive of my players. I have to defend them, it is part of the game. In football you win some and you lose some but it is not a comfortable situation.\"</p> <p>Halfway through the first half Gomes appeared to have Beno\u00eet Assou-Ekotto's backpass under control when he slipped, lost the ball to Fabio Quagliarella and then brought the forward down. Antonio Di Natale converted the penalty and the substitute Simone Pepe settled the tie in the second half.</p> <p>It is almost exactly a year since Ramos took charge at White Hart Lane and 25 years since Spurs won this competition but this was no time for anniversary celebrations. The talking point before and throughout the match was the absence of David Bentley, who could not even find a place on the bench. The winger had trained the previous day without mishap but he had also made some critical comments about Spurs' start to the season, which has left them with only two points from their eight league fixtures. \"It looks like we don't know what we are doing,\" he said.</p> <p>Bentley has had a wretched time and was dropped from the England squad last month when it was suggested that Fabio Capello was unhappy about him playing out of position at White Hart Lane. Last night Ramos would not be drawn on his absence. \"I had to choose 18 players from out of 20. I don't know about his comments,\" he insisted.</p> <p>On last night's showing Bentley was spot-on. But early in the match Spurs played some pleasing football and even looked capable of scoring. But once O'Hara was sent off their cause was hopeless and they finished dejected and so badly beaten that it might have been another league game. It does not get any better: they play at home to Bolton on Sunday, followed by Arsenal on Wednesday and Liverpool on Saturday week.</p> <p>Spurs brought on the Croatian Luka Modric for Assou-Ekotto at the start of the second half but only 12 minutes later they lost O'Hara, who within a few minutes received two yellow cards for fouls on Alexis S\u00e1nchez and was sent off. Udinese picked up their momentum and only two minutes after the red card Gomes had to make a fine save to turn a shot from Di Natale round the right post. In the 63rd minute Gomes backpedalled desperately to clutch another effort from the same forward, who had been put through by Marco Motta.</p> <p>In the first half Spurs enjoyed much of the ball and, especially after Aaron Lennon had established an early ascendancy over the left-back Alexander Lukovic, threatened the Udinese goal. Darren Bent played in front of a five-man midfield but there was offensive support from Lennon and Jermaine Jenas, with Gareth Bale, playing wide on the left, also causing Motta some consternation. They might have broken through as early as the 14th minute when Jenas crossed from the right only to see Bent produce the tamest of headers.</p> <p>But all that promise was cancelled out midway through the first half when Ramos's beleaguered team conceded the penalty. It was so clumsy that Felix Brych, the German official, looked almost embarrassed as he gave it.</p> <p>Gomes, who had been in some distress during Sunday's shambolic defeat by Stoke, lost confidence visibly after that and on the half-hour almost punched Motta's cross straight into the path of Quagliarella. Gomes was punching everything apart from his weight. Quagliarella was clearly under the impression that lightning might strike twice. It always can with Spurs.</p>",
  "<p>Harry Redknapp slammed Braga's \"divers\" after the Portuguese side battered <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/portsmouth\">Portsmouth</a> 3-0 in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa\">Uefa Cup</a> last night. Pompey had four players booked and their manager admitted he was infuriated by the antics of the opposition and the officials. \"I got frustrated with the whole game, to be honest,\" he said. \"Right from the start I thought the referee had no idea whatsoever. It's frightening, they were diving all over the place and nearly every decision seemed to be a booking.\"</p> <p>The Slovenian referee, Darko Ceferin, booked Pompey's Papa Bouba Diop, No\u00e9 Pamarot, Jermain Defoe - for shooting into the net when given offside - and Peter Crouch. He also booked Braga's goalscorer, Wason Renter\u00eda, for trying to persuade him to caution the Pompey substitute Nadir Belhadj for a foul.</p> <p>But Braga's coach, Jorge Jesus, said: \"Our players only went down because of the Portsmouth players' fouls. We thought the referee did a good job.\"</p> <p>Redknapp added: \"A few weeks ago we had a great Turkish referee in Guimaraes near here and it was a good game. This time I thought it was very poor. They [Braga] played well and deserved to win but some of the things they were doing were not right.</p> <p>\"We didn't pass the ball well and never got going. Our final ball was poor, although I thought we had a perfectly good goal disallowed. At 2-1 it could still have changed the game but I don't know why it was disallowed after seeing it again.</p> <p>\"We missed Glen Johnson, who has a pelvic injury, and Lassana Diarra, who has a bad knee. We never looked at our best.But we are still in with a chance of qualifying for the next round. We've got two big home games in the group, one against AC Milan, and there's still all to play for.\"</p> <p>The Uruguayan Lu\u00eds Aguiar fired a 30-yard free-kick past David James in the eighth minute and the Colombian Renter\u00eda added a second just after half-time.

  "<p>When Keynes proposed saving the economy by getting the unemployed to dig holes and then fill them again, he might have been thinking of the Olympics. Gordon Brown has 500 people in a Canary Wharf skyscraper, where he is stuffing their mouths with cash and bonuses in the hope that some of this will spill out and into the pockets of the people. I presume this is neo-Keynesian.</p> <p>It cannot make sense with the approach of national austerity to continue to pour crazy sums of money - \u00a39.3bn - into two weeks of sport. Even Nero would have balked at so much circus at a time of so little bread.</p> <p>Nobody on Earth, outside the surreal International Olympic Committee, would complain if Britain were to announce that such spending is now obscene and propose a more modest \"austerity games\". As a contribution to this exercise, I joined a group of like-minded souls above a pub in Soho this week. We saved the nation some \u00a37bn before the coffee.</p> <p>First cut the crap. Stop talking about legacy, which never happens. Every Olympian knows that legacy is grass growing over defunct velodromes, cracked concourses and ghost villages. Not a penny of the \u00a39bn is going on sport - that is extra - but on buildings, fees and salaries. The head of UK Sport, John Steele, has already declared that his own demand for money \"is investment directed at delivering medal-winning performances\". Whatever happened to just playing the game?</p> <p>Brown was vociferous in attacking City bonuses. What about his Olympics gravy train? At the last count there were 200 officials in the Olympic Development Authority. The lowest-paid member of its management team is on \u00a3243,000, and the highest, David Higgins, \u00a3624,000.</p> <p>They are apparently not up to the job and need a consultancy firm, CLM, with a further 300 staff, to help manage the project, at an astonishing fee of \u00a3400m over four years. This firm had the effrontery last year to charge (the taxpayer) a further \u00a310m in staff bonuses on a project that has tripled in expense.</p> <p>A quite separate body is the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games, whose head is paid \u00a3557,000 and whose members get a reported \u00a31,000 just for attending a meeting. How can Brown insult City bankers when allowing this sort of greed to continue?</p> <p>These people are not even in charge. That duty falls to the 63 civil servants in Tessa Jowell's government Olympics office, of whom nine are on six-figure salaries. Then there is the mayor's Olympics staff and the Home Office's Olympics staff. Simply managing the project is now budgeted to cost \u00a3647m, up from \u00a316m in 2005 - more than will be spent on supporting any Olympic athletes.</p> <p>As totem of this racket, 3,000 limousines are being obtained to ferry Olympics officials to Stratford up a special red-light free \"Zil lane\" on the Mile End Road. The lane will be banned even to athletes' cars. Yet these same officials demanded that London ratepayers build them a unique train service, the Javelin, from St Pancras, which they are now too grand to use. It is beyond satire.</p> <p>The 2012 project has ballooned into a giant bureaucracy with a small sporting festival attached, and is beyond ministerial control. Jowell can only chant her Olympic motto, that in this business she \"spends to save\".</p> <p>The world's greatest white elephant, the \"sustainable\" \u00a3500m athletics stadium, should be stopped now. It will stand empty after the games since nobody wants it. As Building Design magazine said a year ago, \"There is nothing sustainable about building an 80,000-seat stadium for less than two months' use\" at the highest cost per seat in the world.</p> <p>Athletics should go to the (itself vastly expensive) new Wembley stadium, designed by Foster and Partners to be adapted to the Olympics in an emergency at a cost of roughly \u00a3100m. There is now such an emergency. The resulting loss of lower-tier seats would hardly be the end of the world. The stadium is barely full except for opening and closing ceremonies.</p> <p>Other sports can be similarly dispersed. Football and hockey can go to existing London stadiums, of which there are at least 25. Riding can go to Hickstead, and save the trees at Greenwich. Shooting can go to Bisley (rather than spend \u00a311m at Woolwich) and gymnastics, boxing and the rest to the Wembley Arena. The Dome and Excel are standing by.</p> <p>Some \u00a390m for a fencing arena with no subsequent use is indefensible. So is the purpose-built handball \"stadium\" and basketball \"arena\". The aquatic centre, whose cost rose from \u00a373m to \u00a3303m in three years, should have been halted, but the architects' lobby cajoled officials into making the taxpayer cough up. A swimming pool is at least something London needs, though its \"legacy\" replacement has reportedly been scrapped.</p> <p>As for the \u00a32bn budgeted for a press centre and Olympic village, they will not be needed if most sports are dispersed. Neither has begun because neither has a backer or subsequent user. The media look after themselves in war, and can do so in peace. Athletes can be accommodated in hotels, as in 1948.</p> <p>The gold-plating of Stratford - and its casing in \u00a31bn of security - cannot be justified in the present climate. These sums are so divorced from reality, and their opportunity cost so gargantuan, as to have passed every milestone of acceptability. Who needs 30 new bridges and 10 kilometres of roads in what was supposed to be the Hyde Park of the East End?</p> <p>An austerity games would also open up opportunities to bring Olympic sports out of the concentration camp of Stratford and into the park and palaces of London. The best idea I have encountered is to use the Thames itself as a stadium, its shores lined with stands for river-borne opening and closing ceremonies and parades along the Embankment.</p> <p>As mayor, Ken Livingstone brilliantly exploited the river between Westminster and the City for ceremonial and fireworks. The Thames above Hammersmith is already used for rowing, not least the most famous boat race in the world. It would give a new spirit of adventure to water sports.</p> <p>As an original supporter of the Dome, I witnessed a grand project eventually lose its way. But the Dome (at roughly \u00a3600m net) was small change compared with the 2012 games, and at least left a structure which could yet save the Olympic bacon. The Olympic bid was out of hand from the start, held aloft by ever more inflated demands for \"the show to go on at any price\". Any project that relies on national pride for its justification is dodgy.</p> <p>Britain cannot avoid staging the Olympics in 2012. But recession is a golden opportunity to inject sanity into its budget. An austerity games would show that international sport need not be exclusively for rich cities and costly consultants, beholden to lobbies with nothing to do with sport. The financial tail should not wag the Olympic dog.</p> <p>The only profession now able to bring such sanity to bear is that of politics. Has Brown the guts? Has David Cameron?</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:simon.jenkins@theguardian.com\"><br>simon.jenkins@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>For those filmgoers nostalgic for mainstream Hollywood movies of the 1960s, Edie Adams, who has died aged 81, was an indispensable element. The perky redhead (or sometimes blonde) appeared in supporting roles, enlivening 10 films, from 1960 to 1967. </p> <p>Her best film was undoubtedly Billy Wilder's The Apartment (1960), in which Adams made her big-screen debut as Miss Olsen, the secretary and discarded lover of the philandering JD Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray). At an office party, she \"educates\" Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), her boss's current mistress, with delicious relish. \"Before me, there was Miss Rossi in auditing, and after me there was Miss Koch in disability, and right before you, there was miss, um, oh what's-her-name, on the 25th floor ... oh, what a salesman! Always the last booth in the Chinese restaurant - and the same pitch about divorcing his wife - and in the end, you wind up with egg foo yong on your face.\" The film won five Oscars. </p> <p>Adams recalled: \"I always had to laugh when everybody was talking about how hard it is to get into motion pictures. All I had to do was go out to dinner with Ernie [Kovacs, her actor husband] and Billy Wilder and his wife. Billy said to me right off, 'I have a picture for you to shoot on Monday.' You have to realise I'd already been on Broadway. I was kind of huffy about coming out to the big Wild West to do movies.\"</p> <p>Adams, who was born in Kingston, Philadelphia, as Elizabeth Edith Enke, studied opera at the Juilliard School in New York. She started off as a singer on television in Ernie in Kovacsland (later the Ernie Kovacs Show), and went on to become a hit in two Broadway musicals, Leonard Bernstein's Wonderful Town (1953) and Johnny Mercer and Gene de Paul's Li'l Abner (1956).</p> <p>In the former show, she played Rosalind Russell's naive sister Eileen and sang A Little Bit in Love, though she never sang in the movies. According to the New York Times, \"Miss Adams moves through this elusive character with the greatest of ease, keeping it fresh and sweet and adding just enough worldliness to make it palatable.\" In Li'l Abner, adapted from the comic strip, she won a Tony as Daisy Mae, wearing a low-cut polka dot blouse and the shortest of decorously torn skirts, and sang the touching romantic number, Namely You. </p> <p>On screen, after The Apartment, Adams was vivacious in Lover Come Back (1961) as a chorus girl turned advertising model called Rebel Davis, one of lothario Rock Hudson's conquests until Doris Day comes along. She had married the cigar-smoking, mustachioed comedian Kovacs in 1954. They made a great comedy team, both receiving nominations for Emmys for best performance in a comedy series in 1957. Adams wrote an autobiography, Sing a Pretty Song, in which she explained that \"all those years with Ernie taught me how to hold my own in a roomful of comics\". </p> <p>In 1962, Adams and Kovacs left a party at Milton Berle's Los Angeles home in two different cars. The first skidded on the wet road and crashed, killing Kovacs. It was suggested that he was probably lighting one of his cigars when he lost control. After his death, it was discovered that he owed around $500,000 to the Internal Revenue Service in back taxes.</p> <p>Refusing to file for bankruptcy, and declining the offer of a benefit concert offered by friends including Berle, Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin, Adams worked hard, managing to pay back the debt within five years. The work included dozens of television and theatre performances, touring and stock, including Sweet Bird of Youth, Hello, Dolly!, Annie Get Your Gun and a female version of The Odd Couple, as well as films. </p> <p>In 1963, she had roles in four movies, the first as Sid Caesar's wife in Stanley Kramer's epic comedy of greed, It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. There followed Call Me Bwana, in which Adams, as a CIA agent, vied with Anita Ekberg for Bob Hope's affections. In Love With a Proper Stranger, she had a small but showy part as a classy dog-loving stripper who refuses to lend money to her ex-lover Steve McQueen to help his girlfriend (Natalie Wood) get an abortion. </p> <p>The Best Man (1964) saw her as the wife of ambitious politician Cliff Robertson. Adams's last feature film, apart from a role in the misnamed Boxoffice (1982), was as a has-been movie star hoping to inherit Rex Harrison's money in The Honeypot (1966), Joseph Mankiewicz's updated version of Ben Jonson's Volpone. </p> <p>In the US, she was most famous for a series of TV commercials for Muriel cigars that lasted almost 20 years, from the late 50s. Wearing the slinkiest of dresses and the highest of heels, she caressed giant cigars while dancing, and giving a come-hither wink, before whispering the slogan, \"Why don't you pick one up and smoke it some time?\", a sly allusion to Mae West's celebrated \"come up and see me\" invitation. </p> <p>In 1982, tragedy struck again, when her daughter, Mia Kovacs, was killed in a car accident, also in Los Angeles. Adams, who married twice more, to the photographer Marty Mills and the jazz trumpeter Pete Candoli, is survived by her son, Joshua Mills. </p> <p>\u2022 Edie Adams (Elizabeth Edith Enke), actor and singer, born April 16 1927; died October 15 2008</p>",
  "<p>Police chiefs decided yesterday to end the controversial practice of firearms officers writing up their statements together. The practice had been criticised by the high court as an institutionalised \"opportunity for collusion\". </p> <p>The Association of Chief Police Officers accepted the criticism which came after a case bought by the family of the barrister, Mark Saunders, who was shot dead by the Metropolitan police.</p> <p>A senior source told the Guardian: \"Officers will not be able to confer about the crucial points. It's obvious that in the immediate aftermath people will talk to one another. But when they sit down to write an account, they will not be able to do so together. It's just about openness, if you have talked to a colleague about the case, that should be recorded.\"</p> <p>The Independent Police Complaints Commission had also called for the controversial practice to change, as had an investigation by the Metropolitan Police Authority into the shooting dead of Jean Charles de Menezes, the Brazilian shot dead on a London tube train after being suspected of being a suicide bomber.</p> <p>After the De Menezes shooting, officers wrote their statements together and declined to answer questions during interviews under criminal caution by the IPCC. One of the armed officers who shot De Menezes dead is scheduled to give evidence at the inquest today.</p> <p>The senior source said the rules would have to be handled with sensitivity by senior officers: \"It's not always wise to take an account straight after traumatic events as officers may still be traumatised.\" The ruling would probably see lawyers taking a bigger role in advising officers what to say after incidents. \"It will make the whole process more legalistic as lawyers will get involved at an earlier stage. Lawyers may tell officers not to say anything, or not [to say anything] at an early stage.\"</p> <p>Paul Davis, the Police Federation's representative for firearms officers, opposed the move. He said: \"We believe conferring is the best way of protecting our members' interests and getting to the truth in a very difficult and sensitive situation. </p> <p>\"I think it would be seen as an open attack on the professionalism of officers in England and Wales. You are tying the hands of the police officers, leaving them vulnerable, and you could leave the post-incident investigation vulnerable.\"</p> <p>After yesterday's decision, Acpo will rewrite its firearms manual which covers all 43 forces in England and Wales.</p> <p>In the Saunders case the high court expressed concern about \"a general practice under which officers who are key witnesses in an ... investigation are expressly permitted to collaborate in production of their statements: the opportunity for 'collusion' is ... institutionalised.\"</p> <p>Acpo had been grappling with the issue for months, trying to minimise the wrath of armed officers, all of whom are volunteers.</p>",
  "<p>Ed Miliband, the climate change secretary, is close to reaching an agreement on toughening his legally binding climate change targets by promising to take into account emissions from shipping and aviation. He is also expected to include a commitment that by 2012 businesses will be required to report annually on their carbon emissions. Business is responsible for 30% of total emissions.<br> Miliband was praised by environmentalists last week when he increased the UK legal target to cut the greenhouse gas emissions target from 60% to 80% by 2050. Miliband said he was responding to evidence that the science showed the risk of climate change was growing, and said Britain would make an 80% cut to the headline target in its climate change legislation.</p> <p>But he faced widespread criticism over plans to exclude aviation and shipping from his legally binding targets \u2014 blowing a massive hole in the 80% target, according to green campaigners, who argued that the omission of aviation would mean there was no serious business incentive to bring on a new generation of efficient aviation engines. </p> <p>Sixty five Labour MPs, with the support of Frinds of the Earth and led by the former business minister Nigel Griffiths, immediately tabled an amendment to the climate change bill, due to be debated next Tuesday, demanding that ministers take aviation into account when setting the UK's carbon budgets.</p> <p>Such a show of Labour backbench strength would be enough to ensure an embarrassing defeat for Miliband in the opening weeks of his department. <br>Aviation and shipping are estimated to account for 7.6% of all UK emissions. <br>Griffiths said yesterday: \"We have had very positive meetings with Ed Miliband and Joan Ruddock. They \u2026 recognise the need to add emissions, including aviation and maritime. Our discussions have been about how this could be done. We are all agreed that this is desirable.\" </p> <p>Officials have told green groups that they are working on an agreement to require ministers to take into account aviation and maritime emission, using existing international carbon reporting methodology. A duty may also be placed on ministers to report the emission of greenhouse gases from aviation or shipping. </p> <p>Ministers have not yet reached agreement on these proposals with all government departments, with some reluctance from the transport department. </p> <p>The climate change bill, an international first, is designed to set out an economically credible pathway for cuts in UK emissions by 2050 by putting into statute medium- and long-term targets. </p> <p>Miliband has been reluctant to include aviation and shipping in the bill partly because his chief climate change adviser, Lord Turner, said there was no international agreement yet on how to measure aviation and shipping, or specifically on how to allocate emissions between states. It is not easy to reach international agreement, for instance, on how to allocate the emissions of a Spaniard flying on a Swiss aircraft from Madrid to London. </p> <p>Ministers have said that it might take until 2009 to reach an international agreement on whether, or how, to include aviation. </p> <p>A government official said: \"We are hopeful we can reach agreement with our backbenchers, but we are anxious about including something in the bill that cannot yet be measured accurately. This is such an ambitious and ground-breaking bill that we cannot get it wrong.\"</p> <p>Ministers have also given a separate undertaking in the Lords that they will amend the energy bill to support smaller producers of electricity generation. <br>The scheme will give incentives to individual householders, as well as schools, hospitals and community projects. The bill will include an upper limit for feed-in tariffs, possibly set at just over 2 megawatts. An amendment will also be included to encourage small-scale combined heat and power projects.</p>",
  "<p>Public confidence in the national crime statistics has never been high. Opinion polls repeatedly tell us that the public think crime has been rising remorselessly despite the fact that on the best measure that we have available - the British Crime Survey - it has fallen by more than a third since 1995. </p> <p>Indeed, when Charles Clarke was home secretary he thought this lack of public trust had got so bad that it was no longer possible to have a grown-up debate about alternative criminal justice policies.</p> <p>The fiasco over the Home Office publication of the latest quarterly crime figures does nothing to repair that damage. On the face of it there was a good set of figures to report. Overall, on both the BCS and police recorded crime figures the headline crime rate is down by 6% in the 12 months to June 2008, dispelling fears that the economic downturn had already sent the crime rate soaring.</p> <p>Even on violence, the overall picture is encouraging. The murder rate is down by 10%, gun crime by 6% and the 237,000 offences categorised as violence against the person recorded by the police between April and June this year is down 7% on the previous year.</p> <p>Yet this reassuring picture was punctured by the disclosure that the number of offences recorded and categorised by the police as the \"most serious violence against the person\" between April and June this year rose by 22%. </p> <p>The Home Office, unusually for the quarterly crime figures, held a journalists' briefing to explain this apparently alarming figure in the violent crime sub-category. So is this a statistical quirk or does it represent a real surge in the most violent crimes in England and Wales and a consistent under-recording of the most serious violent crime by the police? </p> <p>Professor Paul Wiles, the Home Office's director of research and statistics, explained that the extent of the problem became clear only after an agreed clarification of the counting rules was issued to police forces in April. </p> <p>This said that a case where there was clear evidence of intent to commit grievous bodily harm should be classified as a \"most serious violent offence\" regardless of whether the victim had been injured.</p> <p>Wiles cited the example of a nightclub fight in which a woman smashes a bottle on a nightclub table and then lunges at her victim, but only succeeds in cutting her nose and giving her a nosebleed. </p> <p>It now transpires that many, if not all, of the 43 police forces in England and Wales had been recording such incidents in the alternative - and less serious - category of \"other violence against the person with and without injury\".</p> <p>After the clarification was issued, 13 police forces reported that the number of GBH with intent cases they were reporting had almost doubled. The Home Office asked them to do a recount and they estimated that two-thirds of the 22% rise in this category of violent crime was down to the change in interpretation of the counting rules. </p> <p>The actual increase in more serious violent offences was only 5% - amounting to about 200 assaults out of a total of 237,000 violent crimes. This view was endorsed by the Association of Chief Police Officers.</p> <p>The net result of this recategorisation is a full-scale row about what appears at first sight to be a headline surge in serious violent crime, so undermining, once again, any more balanced picture of the falling crime rate in England and Wales.</p>",
  "<p>A fresh political row over the integrity of the police crime figures broke yesterday after the Home Office disclosed that up to 17 police forces have been under-recording some types of the most serious violent crime.</p> <p>Senior Home Office officials said that the bulk of an apparent 22% rise in the most serious violence category, which includes homicide, attempted murder and grievous bodily harm, was due to a \"misinterpretation\" of the counting rules by at least 17 police forces rather than a surge in actual attacks.</p> <p>Although the police minister, Vernon Coaker, insisted that the quarterly crime figures could still be trusted, both Conservatives and Liberal Democrats heaped embarrassment on the government, claiming the incident proved it was incapable of delivering crime statistics that the public could trust.</p> <p>\"I would be embarrassed if I wasn't coming forward ... and not trying to draw to public attention something which is important,\" said Coaker. \"I want the statistics to be as accurate as possible. We have every confidence in the crime statistics.\"</p> <p>The latest set of quarterly crime figures, whose integrity has been regularly questioned since they were first introduced in 1857, actually shows continuing falls in crime despite the threat of an economic slowdown. </p> <p>Total crime fell by 6% in the year to June 2008 on both the more reliable British Crime Survey and police recorded crime figures, with the risk of becoming a victim of crime at the lowest level since 1981.</p> <p>The BCS shows violent crime has remained steady in the last 12 months, with the police figures suggesting a 7% overall fall in violence against the person. Murders fell from 202 to 182 between April to June 2007 and the same period this year. Gun crime also continued to decline, with a 6% fall recorded by the police. </p> <p>There are signs, however, that incidents of knife crime are growing increasingly serious, with a 28% rise in the number of attempted murders with a blade during the period covered.</p> <p>The political row followed a Home Office briefing, held with the Association of Chief Police Officers, to explain what lay behind the 22% spike in the most serious violent crime figures. Eighteen police forces whose figures almost doubled following a clarification of the counting rules agreed by the Home Office and the police in April were asked to recount their figures. </p> <p>Thirteen forces agreed and it was estimated that two-thirds of the spike in the \"most violent crime\" category was down to this clarification of the counting rules. The change does not affect the overall violent crime total recorded by the police, which fell by 6%. Instead, it is about which category the police assign an incident to if it does not involve an actual injury.</p> <p>The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, said that the increase in most serious forms of violence had been accompanied by a significant drop in less serious violent assaults. \"This change means that this quarter's figures are not comparable with last year's. However, for most types of violence where the guidance has not changed - like homicide, robbery and death by driving - the numbers are down and the overall number of violent crimes is down too - by 7%, almost 18,000 fewer,\" she said.</p> <p>Keith Bristow, the Acpo spokesman and Warwickshire chief constable, later indicated that all the police forces in England and Wales had been affected by the problem to a greater or lesser extent.</p> <p>Humberside, Derbyshire, Cambridgeshire, Thames Valley and North Wales were amongst those forces that were able to complete the recount exercise in time for the publication of the quarterly crime figures yesterday. It is believed that the Metropolitan police were not amongst the four that were unable to take part in the recount.</p> <p>Chris Huhne, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said the failure to tackle serious violence was an alarming blemish on an otherwise encouraging fall in overall crime.</p> <p>\"These figures show that police forces have been understating the seriousness of some of the most violent offences. Correcting that problem has led to an apparent sharp jump in recorded serious violent crime. Serious violent crime - whether gun or knife crime - has to be the police's top priority.\"</p> <p>Dominic Grieve, the shadow home secretary, claimed that the figures fatally undermined the government's spin that violent crime was getting better and betrayed a government that was completely out of touch with what was going on in the streets.</p> <p>\"Labour's target-driven approach has simply been to manipulate the statistics. They should now face up to the reality of their failure and realise that if you can't count a problem, you can't combat it.\"</p>",
  "<p>David Gold last night criticised City of London Police over their protracted investigation into alleged corruption in football, describing the process as \"appalling\" and accusing the police of \"chasing shadows\". The Birmingham City chairman said that those arrested as part of the inquiry had been left feeling as though \"a Sword of Damocles\" was hanging over them because of the continued uncertainty as to whether any charges will be brought. Eight high-profile figures in football remain on bail as part of the two-year investigation and Gold, who was speaking primarily about the arrests of David Sullivan, Birmingham's plc chairman, and Karren Brady, the club's managing director, in April in connection with allegations of false accounting and conspiracy to defraud, believes the police have had more than long enough to gather evidence to decide whether to proceed with charges against those under suspicion.</p> <p>\"The whole process has been appalling,\" said Gold, who remains confident that Sullivan and Brady, who have both strongly denied any wrongdoing, will be cleared in due course. \"I will be glad when it is all done and dusted. I am sure that all of these months and months of the investigation... the police aren't that stupid and, by this time, they would have found something if there is something to be found. It's like a Sword of Damocles hanging over you and I think it's appalling.\"</p> <p>City of London Police would not comment last night other than to confirm that \"eight people remain on bail\" and that the two-year investigation is \"ongoing\". Although a dossier containing evidence was delivered to the Crown Prosecution Service in July, there is no indication as to when the inquiry might come to an end. Indeed, much to Gold's frustration, the CPS does not have to bring charges within any set time for offences that would be set down for the crown court and, as a result, those arrested could remain on bail for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>\"I never knew this law existed, where this hangs over you,\" added Gold. \"It almost goes on indefinitely and you have got no recourse. You have got recourse in business where you say, 'Put up or shut up', if you are negotiating. If you were in Cuba or the old communist states or Uganda, these things happen. But this is a process that has been in place for many years and nobody has addressed it. There is no time limit but surely there has to be.\"</p> <p>Gold, who has been interviewed twice by City of London Police as a witness and not a suspect, claimed that Sullivan and Brady had both found the experience extremely stressful. He admits he is concerned that others will take the attitude that \"there is no smoke without fire\" but believes that the investigation at St Andrew's, which has looked into several transfer deals, including Aliou Ciss\u00e9's \u00a3300,000 move from Birmingham to Portsmouth in August 2004, will not produce any evidence of wrongdoing.</p> <p>\"We are waiting for the police to say, 'Thank you very much for all your help, there will be no further inquiries and enjoy the rest of your life,'\" added the Birmingham chairman. \"That's what we are expecting. The longer this goes on, the more we are convinced the police are chasing shadows and that there is no substance in their inquiries. As far as Birmingham City Football Club is concerned, the sooner they announce that they have completed their inquiries and that there are no charges, the better for everybody.\"</p>",
  "<p>'I could never pursue a career in politics,\" croaks a figure sprawled across a sofa in the corner of a darkened room, skater's sock-cap pulled down over his sunglasses. \"I've been involved in far too many scandals.\"</p> <p>\"My mom says you have too many tattoos,\" laughs the fresh-faced, baseball-capped boy beside him.</p> <p>\"Yeah, too many scandals and too many tattoos,\" grins the skater. \"Isn't that an irony, though, now that so many of our generation have tattoos? A tattooed person will end up in office one day, mark my words. Not necessarily at a presidential level, but there will be people with tattoos in the administration.\"</p> <p>It seems Pete Wentz - the bass player, songwriter and public face of Fall Out Boy - has a dream. This morning, however, he also has a head cold, jetlag and a hangover. It is midday, and Wentz appears near-comatose, resembling the fictional rock star Hotblack Desiato from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, who spent a year being dead for tax reasons. </p> <p>The night before, Fall Out Boy arrived in Barcelona to celebrate the opening of their latest Angels &amp; Kings nightclub, a party that stretched on into the early hours of this morning. But discussion of the group's new album, Folie \u00e0 Deux, which the band planned to release on the day of the American presidential election, has shaken him from his daze.</p> <p>\"Releasing the album on the same day as the election was an entirely conscious decision,\" explains Patrick Stump, the one in the baseball cap, who plays guitar and sings. \"Like, I went to sleep last night with BBC News 24 on, and there was a guy from India explaining that the outcome of the American election would have an effect on the whole world. If that's the case, then I don't know why we're taking it so lightly. This might be the most important election my generation get to vote in, and there's a lot of responsibility upon the American people, to really pay attention this time. But people are behaving like it was a sporting event, waving flags and yelling, 'Go team!'\"</p> <p>Accordingly, Folie \u00e0 Deux contains no partisan sloganeering, although Stump contends the songs share a common message, focusing on \"the effects of individuals' actions upon the larger world, as a result of the poor decisions they make. So maybe they should think about the consequences of their actions.\"</p> <p>Certainly, a deviation into the explicitly political territory of Rage Against the Machine would be a jarring change of direction for Fall Out Boy. While their roots lie in Chicago's underground punk scene - Wentz and drummer Andy Hurley played in Racetraitor, a late 90s hardcore troupe who espoused veganism, anti-imperialism and grisly riffage - Fall Out Boy are, inarguably, a pop band, one whose rise was aided by the support of MTV's mainstream pop show Total Request Live, which helped them find an audience that is largely teenaged and largely female.</p> <p>Wentz's disaffected, sometimes solipsistic lyrics - along with his olive-skinned good looks - have made Fall Out Boy poster boys for the emo generation of teens, their hormonal and existential angst finding a reflection in Fall Out Boy's tantrum-tossed anthems. He's become the erudite voice of a particular stratum of youth: the suburban kids who, like Wentz, have been diagnosed with emotional problems, and have struggled with both prescribed medication and illicit chemicals.</p> <p>\"I think that medication has helped me at times in my life,\" explained Wentz when I interviewed him last year, after a show in Las Vegas. \"I've needed to be on medication, it's saved my life. But it's definitely an over-medicated generation. Rather than having any kinds of conversations with anyone to solve our problems, we go and see what pill we can take to make it all go away.\"</p> <p>Wentz is bipolar, and in 2005 he attempted to kill himself with an overdose, an event that inspired the song 7 Minutes in Heaven (Atavan Halen) on Fall Out Boy's breakthrough album From Under the Cork Tree. He subsequently filmed public service announcements for American television, highlighting the issue of youth depression. But the confessional, emotional tenor of his lyrics is tempered by his witty wordplay; the best Fall Out Boy songs make for classic neurotic American teen pop culture, like the John Hughes movies Wentz worships.</p> <p>\"I feel like the last person who should be giving advice to anyone about anything,\" Wentz says of the fans who deluge Fall Out Boy's website with desperate pleas for help. \"I think part of it is we're living in the age of the internet: if it had been around back in the days of the Smiths and the Cure, I'm sure people would be writing to their website, asking, 'Oh Morrissey, I'm so depressed. too, what should I do?'\" He laughs at the idea.</p> <p>Wentz's fame isn't limited to his fans, though. He became a tabloid figure in 2006, when an ex-girlfriend leaked naked photos Wentz had taken of himself on to the internet. Latterly, he has become a staple in America because of his marriage to the actress and pop singer Ashlee Simpson. </p> <p>The couple, who are expecting their first child before the year is out, are now regulars on Perez Hilton's gossip blog, and Wentz featured in a Vanity Fair piece in summer 2007 about the boyfriends of the young Hollywood women who are the centre of LA's gossip culture. \"Everyone writes stories about Ashlee and I going out to nightclubs or whatever,\" he said, in Vegas, \"but nobody writes about how much fun we had just riding mountain bikes and hanging out in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. There was no one there to recognise us. It was fun, being 'normal' like everyone else. It's like a weird fantasy to have.</p> <p>\"I feel good now,\" Wentz continues, \"like I wish I could take deaging juice and go back to when I was 16 or something, and relive it all again knowing what I know now. The things that were difficult in my life have remained or become more difficult; it's like the song, Mo Money Mo Problems. But I'm 29 now, I have a wife, and a baby on the way. I see the world in an entirely different way.\"</p> <p>In downtime from Fall Out Boy, Wentz runs his own record label (Decaydence), clothing company (Clandestine Industries) and film production company (Bartskull), while also pursuing careers as an author, model, actor and host of his own show on MTV. The Barcelona branch of Angels &amp; Kings is Fall Out Boy's third; they opened their first in New York. </p> <p>All three bars share a d\u00e9cor - black painted walls hung with framed mugshots of Jimi Hendrix, Steve McQueen and Frank Sinatra - though the Barcelona venue, located on the sixth floor terrace of the newly opened ME Hotel, with its own outdoor heated swimming pool, is the most impressive. \"We saw this location and thought it was cool,\" Wentz says, of the offer to open in Barcelona. \"To be this close to Gaudi's Sagrada Familia couldn't ever be a bad thing. We've realised we have an 'aesthetic', that we are a brand,\" he adds. \"When you're a brand, you have to be careful who you partner with.\"</p> <p>Memories of Wentz's darker, more hedonistic days still offer raw material for Folie \u00e0 Deux, most explicitly on 27, with its references to \"Doing lines of dust off last night's stage/ Just to feel like you.\" Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison and Kurt Cobain all died when they were 27, and Wentz says he spent much of that year \"toxic, just completely over-medicated. I was stoked to make it past 27,\" he grins. \"Everyone was really worried. My management company were panicked, because I was I was out of the office, and 'pharmaceutically engaged'.\"</p> <p>\"There was a countdown clock and everything,\" laughs Stump. \"I remember, our manager called me up on Pete's 28th birthday and screamed, 'We made it!'\"</p> <p>As our interview draws to a close, Stump returns to the topic of the album's election day release. \"The point is,\" he concludes, \"when Folie \u00e0 Deux's released, we won't be partying at some record company album launch, we'll be out there voting. And I hope a lot of other people are, too.\"</p> <p>Several days later, however, Fall Out Boy announce via their website that Folie \u00e0 Deux won't see the shelves until early December, a decision they made themselves. \"This is not the election to be 'cute',\" they explain, adding: \"We feel that many of the interviews for the record have skewed us into a partisan band. We never intended to shove our ideas down people's throats.\"</p> <p>The decision seems less motivated by a desire to protect their \"brand\" from the sort of fan backlash the Dixie Chicks suffered after speaking out against George Bush in 2003 than by an earnest desire to not cloud the election season with what could be viewed as a promotional gimmick. They also realise that, in such a climate, even the most earnest attempt by a celebrity to enter the partisan fray could clumsy backfire on his chosen candidate. </p> <p>There can be no doubt on who that is for Fall Out Boy. In Barcelona, Stump said, \"All four of us fall more on the liberal side of things,\" while the video for their new single I Don't Care closes with a villainous character pulling back a mask to reveal he's really Sarah Palin. And earlier in the summer, they played at the Democratic convention in Denver, though Stump didn't get to meet Obama. </p> <p>\"I wish,\" he chuckles. \"But that's not important. I don't want it to taint the message of the record, which is that we're not considering the issues, or our actions, hard enough.\" </p> <p>Stump says he has friends and relatives who are Republicans, and he respects their views, and believes that \"everyone, regardless of their party affiliation, should at least consider voting for the other side, to truly get to understand their policies and positions.\" He can't resist adding, however, that \"people should be willing to understand that the vice president could possibly become president, and to think about the implications of that.</p> <p>\"People need to research the policies of the candidates closely - and that includes Obama - and not be distracted by the media misrepresentations. Like Fox News: their bias is so blatant, it's offensive. They don't report news. If there was a school shooting, they'd be finding ways to blame it on the Democrats. I think it would be a shame if somebody voted for Obama because so many celebrities support him. I think it would be tragic if someone voted for McCain because Fox News doesn't know shit.</p> <p>\"It's really easy to offend people in America right now. You have to tread lightly. My stepdad is very right wing - at the dinner table we'll have pretty frank political conversations, but I'm not going to have that same conversation at a restaurant in public, where the guy behind me might be totally offended.\"</p> <p>\"But that's where you're supposed to have those conversations,\" protests Wentz. \"And loudly. Although I try not to provoke people anymore, because I don't think the judge will let me off with any more community service.\" </p> <p>He laughs, but then turns serious, perhaps dreaming again of America's first tattooed president. \"I want to work on humanitarian causes in some capacity, and that'll involve working with both parties, I expect. So I'm trying not to upset anyone.\" </p> <p>\u2022 The single I Don't Care is out now on Mercury. Folie \u00e0 Deux is released on December 15</p>",
  "<p>As George Osborne has discovered, there are many conversations that would more comfortably remain private. What is true in politics is even truer in finance. So rousing cheers for the US Congress's house oversight and government reform committee and its terrier-like chairman, Henry Waxman, from whose hearings into financial regulation it is possible simultaneously to peer into the entrails of the current banking crisis and share in a national catharsis. It was Mr Waxman who earlier this month demanded of the Lehman Brothers boss Richard Fuld: \"Your company is now bankrupt and our country is in a state of crisis. You get to keep $480m ... Is that fair?\" And it was Mr Waxman's committee which this week published documents that the credit rating agency involved would surely rather had remained secret. One exchange between employees read: \"It [an investment vehicle] could be structured by cows and we would rate it.\" Yesterday he even got Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve head, to admit he had \"found a flaw\" in his belief in the markets' capacity for self-regulation. How unlikely that anything to match this will emerge from the British way of scrutiny.</p> <p>The American political system is famously as different as it is misleadingly similar to the British. Nor is it perfect. But the congressional committees encourage an independence of outlook that supports a robust political culture of accountability which at its best both improves legislation and informs public debate. Here, nothing - not a peep of contrition nor a word of explanation - has been heard from the bankers at the heart of the crisis. MPs on the Treasury select committee are only just gearing up for an inquiry, their first response to events that, since the summer break, have tipped the country into recession and jeopardised people's homes, jobs and futures. Early next month they will interview the men who managed the crisis - the chancellor, the governor of the Bank of England and the chairman of the Financial Services Authority. But what people lying sleepless in fear of negative equity or the future of their pension really want is answers from those who brought about this crisis. They want to know why the former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin thought it was a good idea to buy ABN Amro at the top of the market, and how HBOS's Andy Crosby took such a risk on money markets, and why Lloyds TSB will take \u00a317bn of taxpayers' cash yet is still promising bonuses all round. The decorous Treasury committee shows no sign of sharing Mr Waxman's instinct for the jugular.</p> <p>Defenders of the structure of Westminster's committees talk of their stamina and their ability to track developments long term; and each has its place. But they are not what is needed now and there is little faith, even in Westminster, that committees can deliver the blend of public retribution and forensic examination that is needed, despite being better-resourced and more extensively staffed than ever. The weakness lies deep in the Commons' DNA, in the symbiotic relationship between MPs and government. There is no appetite here for the challenge that congressional committees can deliver. A government that was determined to get it right long-term might look at the Hutton inquiry into the Kelly affair. It was made absurd by its conclusions, but its transparency of conduct, and the Blair government's embarrassed cooperation with it, forced a sharp reappraisal of the way Downing Street was managed and a permanent change in the way some key appointments are made. An inquiry into the financial crisis has a much more complex task. But if Gordon Brown is seriously committed to constitutional renewal he might take this as the moment to start to reinvent the House of Lords as a chamber of scrutiny, with powers of investigation to rival Congress. It will take nothing less. As the Osborne affair so vividly illustrates, bankers are jealous of their privacy.</p>",
  "<p>Behold, cinema's Gary Busey, who - in one of those charming little end-of-days twists - is now Rodney King's sober sponsor. Yes, that Rodney King, who has made the transition from nightvision police-beaten star to drug addict sufficiently broken as to have signed on for American reality show Celebrity Rehab, during which he is filmed 24/7 while receiving treatment for substance abuse. </p> <p>Busey is on set as a kind of Svengali figure because, by his own account, he's been clean for 13 years. Can you believe it? It means he got those veneers done when he was sober. But does it also mean he was high during the making of Point Break? Lost in Showbiz finds that hard to believe. Are you telling me he was using when he points the gun at that surfer and yells, \"Speak into the microphone, squidbrain\"? That he was high when he sneered, \"I was in this bureau while you were still popping zits on your funny face and jacking off to the lingerie section of the Sears catalogue\"? Come on! To have brought such subtly shaded life to the character of jaded Los Angeles cop Angelo Pappas while blowing rails between every take - well, it's just not possible.</p> <p>Anyhow, as part of his \"I've been there, dude\" role on Celebrity Rehab, Gary has had to trot out the odd rock bottom anecdote from those glory days. We're going to play out with a personal favourite, which details the time three wraps of cocaine fell on Gary's floor and his dog, Chili, rolled in them. Busey was not about to let that go to waste. </p> <p>\"And I went in like a crop-duster,\" Gary tells viewers, doing the sound effects, \"with my nose flying first and snorted the cocaine off the dog. \"Back, butt, side,\" he expands in another interview. \"Not a spot was left. It took me 25 minutes to snort all the cocaine the dog had on her coat. The fringe benefits of this were that the fleas, the dog hair, the mud, and the sweat went in my nose, too. It's not a good flavour coming off the dog.\"</p> <p>I believe that rehab etiquette requires us to respond: \"Thank you for sharing, Gary.\"</p>",
  "<p>Here is what we know. George Osborne and the Tory party's top fundraiser talked to Nathaniel Rothschild at his villa on Corfu about getting a donation of \u00a350,000 out of a Russian billionaire - who then refused. Peter Mandelson also stayed in the Rothschild villa and visited the billionaire's yacht at the same time. The result: a roiling media-political scandal. Meanwhile Barack Obama raises $153m from rich and poor in a single month - nearly 2,000 times more than the shadow chancellor and Andrew Feldman talked about getting from Oleg Deripaska. The result this time: an ongoing media-political beatification. </p> <p>Truly, ours is an age of cant. The British and US political systems naturally have many differences. In both of them, though, fundraising from the rich is an inescapable precondition of electability. All politicians on both sides of the Atlantic have to do it. The cost of an American contest dwarfs ours because of America's paid television advertising system, which we do not allow. Nevertheless, Obama is currently spending his way to victory while basking in worldwide acclaim. Yet whenever a British politician is revealed raising money, even on a far smaller scale, the default response is denunciation.</p> <p>Don't get this wrong. It wasn't just the seafood souvlaki that was fishy on Corfu in August. Gordon Brown was right to say the abortive Osborne-Feldman-Rothschild donation scheme was a serious matter. But be clear what was serious about it and what was not. A politician holidaying with a financier friend is not, in itself, serious or wrong - whatever the censorious or even the circumspect may say. Nor is it wrong for a politician to accept an invitation to a passing billionaire's yacht, even though it is something that most of us will never get the opportunity even to refuse.</p> <p>The serious bit was the discussion that took place at Nat Rothschild's villa about getting a donation out of Deripaska. It is serious not because Deripaska is a Russian or an oligarch or personally disreputable, but simply because he is a foreigner. Donations to UK political parties by foreigners have been outlawed since 2000. Osborne and Feldman must have known this. Yet they still talked about getting money from Deripaska. In the event, the Russian aluminium king spared their blushes by refusing to donate. But what if he had said yes?</p> <p>The real story at the heart of the Corfu saga is the existence of a loophole in the 2000 act and its exploitation by political fundraisers. A foreigner cannot donate to a political party - but in certain circumstances a British company owned by a foreigner can. Deripaska owns what used to be Leyland DAF, a UK firm. Did Osborne, Feldman and Rothschild therefore hatch a proposal for Deripaska to use his company to make a donation? We do not know the answer. Given yesterday's apparent truce between Rothschild and the Tories, we may never do so. Either way, soliciting money by this means is against the spirit of the law.</p> <p>The loophole is, nevertheless, in use. The Financial Times reported yesterday on the case of the London-based US financier Robin Saunders, whose attempt to make a personal donation of \u00a36,000 to the Conservative party was refused but whose company then made a similar donation, which was accepted. The New Statesman documents a similar case with an Irish donor and goes further, reporting that prominent Australian and German businessmen have each made donations to the Tory party that have been accepted because each is legally on the UK electoral register, even though neither of them is British.</p> <p>In these circumstances, the prime minister, with his call for an investigation into the Corfu affair - which caught his officials on the hop on Wednesday - may be on to something. Labour's Denis MacShane and the Lib Dems' Chris Huhne were right to press the Electoral Commission to look at it. The commission was wrong to dismiss these calls, especially so quickly. Even if such an investigation was felt to be disproportionate, a loopholes probe is surely needed.</p> <p>That said, there has been the usual depressingly predictable surfeit of British sanctimony about this episode. Holidays in a Greek villa. Yachts in the Ionian Sea. Drinks by the Mediterranean. To read some of the comment about the Corfu affair you would think that these are experiences or aspirations utterly beyond the ken of the average middle-class person - let alone their hard-drinking and clubbing teenage children. The Rothschild pad is presumably at the luxury end of the market, but so what? Are politicians - Labour politicians in particular - not allowed to have rich friends? That seems both harsh and hypocritical. In my experience common sense and congeniality varies among the rich and the poor, the right wing and the left wing, just as it does among the young and the old. Having a rich friend is not a betrayal of the cause. </p> <p>Three wider lessons emerge from all this. The first is that while ministers - which none of those involved in the Corfu events was at the time - are required to stick rigorously to the ministerial code in their private and public life, shadow ministers probably should do so too. Without such a protocol, and civil service advice available to those who are covered by it, there will always be a suspicion that prospective ministers are available for hire.</p> <p>The second is that British politicians, ministers included, must assume that the pack will always be out to get them over their private life. The company they keep, the places they go, the things they like to do - in the US the state of their health and tax returns - are never off-limits for a second. This particularly applies to politicians who love both privacy and publicity alike. It's an unenviable reality. Call this Mandelson's Law.</p> <p>And finally it is another reminder that we get what we are prepared to pay for. If we had public funding for political parties, many but not all of these issues would shrivel. Without it we condemn politicians to solicit money from potential supporters and thus to encourage the destructive sanctimony of MPs and writers who make a living out of smugness. Do we really despise politicians so much that we insist they continue to behave in ways that make us despise them more, while refusing to do the one thing that might help us despise them less? If that is so - and it seems it is - it says more about us than the politicians. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.kettle@theguardian.com\">martin.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Wednesday October 29 2008</strong></p> <p> The use of the word \"our\" in the subheading above might have suggested that Fadhil Chalabi was writing as a representative of the Iraqi government. That is not the case and his view is an independent one. He has not lived in Iraq nor worked for the Iraqi government since 1976</p> <p> </p> <p>Your news report distorts the true nature of negotiations being conducted by the Iraqi government with international oil companies (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/13/oil-iraq\">Iraqi government fuels war-for-oil theories by putting reserves up for biggest ever sale</a>, October 13). You describe these talks as \"the biggest sale of oil assets ever ... 40bn barrels of recoverable reserves up for offer in London\"; but these reserves are certainly not for sale. </p> <p>It appears your reporters were confused by the term \"risk service agreement\", by which the Iraqi government invites various oil companies (which possess the latest technology) to enter into service contracts in order to restore and increase the production capacity of Iraq's oilfields. By definition these service agreements do not entitle companies to any share of, or access to, oil reserves.</p> <p>The proposed agreements concern first and foremost the rehabilitation of existing oil-producing fields, such as Kirkuk and Basra, whose production capacity has fallen dramatically as a result of air strikes during two Gulf wars and prolonged UN sanctions. The prime target is to restore the fields' capacity to the higher levels which, prior to those wars, stood at around 4m barrels per day. This rehabilitation urgently needs to be achieved if Iraq's beleaguered economy is to recover (regardless of the continued presence of coalition forces).</p> <p>However, it is quite evident that certain vested interests, in particular some in other oil-producing nations, seek to thwart any substantial improvement in Iraq's oil production levels, as any such increase will affect their market shares and risk pushing oil prices downwards.</p> <p>Prior to Saddam's invasion of Kuwait and the 1991 Gulf war, Iraq's production quota stood at around 14.5% of Opec's total production (without Angola, which has recently joined the organisation). If Iraq were to regain its quota share, its daily oil production would increase by 2m barrels, thereby posing a problem for Opec in adjusting its quota system.</p> <p>It is only to be expected that Iraq wishes to restore its former oil production capacity, and it is absurd to misinterpret this as handing over Iraq's reserves to the international oil companies.</p> <p>Your reporters quoted their source as Greg Muttitt, who represents \"a UK-based social and ecological justice group\" and who professes to be \"alarmed that the government is pushing ahead with its plans ... [because] there is no precedent for proven oil reserves of this magnitude being offered up for sale\". But the negotiations in question have nothing whatsoever to do with Iraq's reserves. The agreements would never apply either directly or indirectly to any control of reserves, which remain under the sacrosanct ownership of Iraq. What is unusual about the contracts is that they are set to last for 20 years, whereas normally the service contractor finishes his contract term as soon as the tasks assigned by the government are completed. </p> <p>It is evident from Muttitt's conclusions that he lacks knowledge of Iraq's service contracts and the oil reserves situation. The prospect of a speedy rehabilitation of Iraq's oil industry should be welcomed, not dismissed as a conspiracy on the part of the oil companies to rip off Iraq's oil wealth.</p> <p>\u2022 Fadhil Chalabi is the executive director of the Centre for Global Energy Studies, London, and Iraq's former permanent undersecretary for oil <br><a href=\"mailto:forbes@cges.co.uk\">forbes@cges.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>It's like Grand Designs meets Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, on a scale that would have suited the Beijing Olympics. There's that sharp, sulphurous whiff that always fills the air towards the end of construction projects, and a great deal of dust. Thousands of people - men, in the main - in hard-hats and fluorescent jackets are fixing fittings, putting down wiring, and hodding endless consignments of cardboard boxes. Above us, there's an undulating glass roof, apparently meant to capture the effect of a pebble being dropped into a pool, supported by white struts that are supposed to look like trees. One of our guides enthusiastically tells us the effect is meant to be \"organic\", though whether nature offers any examples of water being held up by woodland is an interesting question.</p> <p>Welcome to Westfield London: 1.5m square metres of shopping centre, built at a cost of \u00a31.6bn, dropped on to Shepherd's Bush, and due to be opened by Boris Johnson next Thursday. The company from which it takes its name is a vast multinational outfit, co-founded by its current chairman, a 78-year-old Holocaust survivor and naturalised Australian called Frank Lowy, who is currently under investigation for alleged tax evasion in Australia (a claim he denies, and which, he says, \"disturbs and upsets\" him). Westfield is involved in shopping centres in Australia, New Zealand and the US, as well as eight in the UK; the ninth and 10th will be Westfield Bradford and Westfield Stratford City, built into the site of the London Olympics, and set to open in March 2011.</p> <p>Westfield London will be Britain's largest shopping mecca after Bluewater in Kent and Gateshead's MetroCentre. Women are projected to make up 75% of its customers; it also relies on the fact that a sizable share of people within a five-mile radius are classified as \"educated urbanites\", and therefore exactly the kind of people high-street retailers want to attract. The essential idea, according to its sumptuous promotional material, is that \"indulgence is no longer the preserve of the very rich\". It talks about something that is \"aspirational, yet inclusive\", and claims that the centre \"takes the purity and indulgence of luxury and positions it as inclusive and accessible\". </p> <p>What this means in practice is an awkward mixture of high-end opulence and high-street ordinariness. There is space for Topshop and Superdrug, but for \u00a390 an hour, those who can afford it will be able to hire a personal shopping assistant-cum-stylist. There will be valet parking and home delivery. Then there is an area known as The Village, which will host such dizzying names as Mulberry, Tiffany &amp; Co and Louis Vuitton, surely aimed at the well-heeled residents of nearby Notting Hill, Holland Park, Kensington and Chelsea. </p> <p>And so to the bad news. Westfield's kind of capitalism is not nimble and quick to react, but based on decade-long developments. Its west London centre arrives in the midst of nightmarish times for the retail trade, as illustrated by recent stories about some of the businesses that are about to move in. Waitrose's sales are slipping week by week. Debenhams' profits in the year to August 2008 fell by more than \u00a320m. The last two financial quarters have seen Marks &amp; Spencer's sales drop by 5.3% and 6.1%, and House Of Fraser is partly owned by the ruined Icelandic group Baugur. With Next, these four names form Westfield London's \"anchor stores\".</p> <p>Still, this is not the only place opening at such a precarious moment. Leicester's new Highcross Centre - \"an awe-inspiring mix of fashionable stores, stylish restaurants and true city centre living\" - began trading on September 4. In Bristol, there is Cabot Circus, a self-styled \"retail destination\" that opened on September 25. Liverpool ONE, a 42-acre development based on 160 shops, marked its first full day of trading on October 1. Similar retail leviathans are in the pipeline for Preston, Cardiff, Aberdeen, Bath and Ipswich, as well as Wrexham, Aylesbury and Newbury. If recent events are anything to go by, their stories will follow the same pattern: local hostility, and questions about the viability of massive shopping centres in such lean times, followed by openings hyped up as against-the-odd triumphs. </p> <p>For the past week, I have been talking to people from the retail trade and my brain is awash with the kind of jargon that can make politicians look like merchants of the plainest English. Everything is about \"footfall\", \"retail mix\", \"psychographics\" and \"experiential marketing\". When reminded of the prospect of recession and shrinking high-street spending, most of them stick to the same rather Darwinian script: the strongest will survive, and that means them.</p> <p>The day before my visit to Westfield London, Mary \"Queen Of Shops\" Portas calls. Her PR and consultancy business Yellowdoor is handling Westfield's launch, and she has been working with the centre's senior management on, \"what I think behaviour patterns will be, just in terms of promotions, events and associations\". But what, I wonder, of the state of the economy?</p> <p>\"Is it an ideal time to open?\" she considers. \"Probably not. But this thing's been in the planning for 10 years, and in the building for five, you know? None of us can predict what the future is, but I do believe that everyone's feeling so flat about what's happening with the credit crunch that there'll be places we'll go to for a lift, to feel upbeat. I think people will go there with their families, to go to the cinema, to have a bit to eat - and in decent restaurants. I'm not talking about Spudulike. They'll be doing fashion shows, exhibitions, retrospectives . . . you don't really get that elsewhere. And in times like these, I want a bit of joy. Don't you?\"</p> <p>Westfield, she says, is all about \"mixing supermarkets, with the high street, with luxury brands, all in one space\". She claims that \"this has never happened in the UK before\" - apparently ignoring London's poor old West End. \"If this means the crap parts of Oxford Street suffer, I don't give a monkey's, because they're rubbish,\" she says. \"When I pass Topshop and I go towards Tottenham Court Road, I want to kill myself.\"</p> <p>Keith Mabbett is Westfield London's senior leasing executive, charged with filling its 260-odd spaces. He says 98% are done deals, and so his optimistic account of the centre's prospects continues. \"What you see here,\" he says, \"is something with which there isn't a comparison in the world.\" But what of the downturn? \"You live through these cycles. I take the view that we're creating something with longevity that will ride these storms. But we're not immune from it, by any stretch of the imagination.\"</p> <p>Most of the centre's contracts were signed before the recent plunge in the markets, but three chains, he says, have pulled out of their agreements, along with one restaurant. \"In the last six months, the credit crunch and the availability of capital has influenced deals,\" he goes on. \"There's no doubt about that. How? More generosity in terms. We've extended rent-free periods to assist companies getting over gaps in finance. Prior to the crunch, we would have offered 12 or 13 months rent-free. Now, on the latter deals, we're nearer 18 months.\" The standard annual rent for an average-sized retail space at Westfield London is around \u00a3300,000, so he's talking about an enticement of around \u00a3450,000.</p> <p>From certain angles, you can peer beyond Westfield's walls, and out into neighbourhoods such as Shepherd's Bush, the high-rise flats near Latimer Road and Wood Lane. Here, residents are complaining about dust, noise, allegations of rats being accidentally let loose, and the fact that work has been going on through the night. </p> <p>In fairness to Westfield, its behaviour does not quite mark it down as a group of ruthless capitalists, though just about every one of its philanthropic gestures has a downside. After pressure from the community organisation London Citizens, it agreed to pay all its employees and contractors the London Living Wage of \u00a37.45 an hour, though this will not apply to staff of the centre's shops. It has also put up \u00a34m for the sprucing-up of Shepherd's Bush green, though the plans mean the closure of a much-loved local venue called Ginglik, in a converted public toilet. </p> <p>Most remarkably, Westfield has contributed \u00a3170m to redeveloping Shepherd's Bush's main tube station, opening a new Hammersmith and City line stop, putting in a new overground rail station, and radically changing local bus services. Again, there are drawbacks. According to some people, the fact that Westfield has put in so much money has had one inevitable upshot: as the local MP, Labour's Andy Slaughter, puts it, \"Everything is now funnelled in and out of Westfield, without stopping in the locality.\" Given that the existing local convenience shops rely on passing trade, this may not be good news - and plenty of local traders are already reeling from the nine-month closure of the Central line station.</p> <p>\"This is a cuckoo in the nest,\" says Slaughter, whose ire is partly based on what he sees as Westfield's cosy relationship with Hammersmith and Fulham's Conservative council. \"They're not pitching it at many local people. They're going for people coming in from Kensington and Westminster, or people driving in from Berkshire and Buckinghamshire along the M40. The implication is that you're going to get even more 4X4 sort of traffic, and fewer people coming on foot or by public transport. They're in severe danger of gridlock, from day one. And then you're on to another issue: can a relatively small local centre like Shepherd's Bush cope with this?\"</p> <p>Cabot Circus in Bristol is a \u00a3600m \"mixed-use masterplan\", owned by the Bristol Alliance, a joint venture between the property group Land Securities and Hammerson. Provisionally called Merchants' Quarter until the name was dropped because of its slave-trade connotations, it contains 140 shops, around 25 restaurants and cafes, and a 14-screen cinema containing two \"Director's Halls\", which offer what amounts to club-class film-going: \"ultra-wide\" leather seats for \u00a312. Millions have also been spent on specially commissioned artworks, and there are 266 new housing units, 24 of which are earmarked as \"affordable\".</p> <p>Part of what's here is a fantastically upmarket square called Quakers Friars, and a shopping street that sits at the retail market's top end. In the menswear department of Harvey Nichols, the downturn is apparently being held at bay. A Gucci jacket that amounts to a posh cagoule is going for \u00a3540. A John Smedley cardigan will cost you \u00a3155; best of all, there's an apparently bog-standard green hoodie, featuring the words \"Billionaire Boys Club\", on sale for a mere \u00a3160. </p> <p>Somewhat predictably, the management claims that despite endless bad news from the high street, all is well. Centre director Richard Belt and soon-to-depart project director Bob De Barr talk about what they see as Bristol's decline as a retail centre, and \"bringing the city back up the hierarchy to where it belongs\". Cabot Circus, they claim, is all about \"the right kind of 21st-century retailing\", and avenging the fact that Bristol has traditionally offered \"a disappointing shopping experience\". If some people look at the lineup of shops - H&amp;M, Next, Dorothy Perkins, H Samuel - and see the stuff of clone towns, it doesn't much bother them. \"You do get people saying, 'All the shops are the same,'\" says De Barr, \"but a lot of shops are the same in all cities, because people like them.\"</p> <p>The retail trade's darkening economic prospects are also briskly dealt with. \"I'd be naive to say we're not being affected by what's going on,\" says Belt. \"But because Bristol was so far down the retail rankings, and we've put it back up, we're pulling people from places where they haven't been coming to Bristol for years.\" As with Westfield London, they say that numbers of pullouts have been tiny: \"one or two\" chains have withdrawn, along with a single restaurant, though I get the sense that at least a few businesses decided not to get involved at all. </p> <p>De Barr and Belt do not like the term \"shopping centre\". Theirs is a \"retail destination\", a distinction based on the fact that Cabot Circus bleeds out into the city, and surrounding streets they are busy redeveloping. The fact that their turf includes open areas points up one of the more unsettling aspects of the development: what seem to be ordinary streets are actually privately owned.</p> <p>\"It's an interesting one, this,\" says Belt. \"These places are quite a new breed. We've applied all the usual rules that shopping centres do, but because it's a streetscape, it's getting customers scratching their heads a bit.\" Cycling is forbidden. Unless you have a visual impairment, should you turn up with a dog, you'll be told to leave it at home next time. Security staff in regulation black blazers keep a constant watch on what's going on, including smoking. \"Three quarters of Cabot Circus has got a roof,\" says Belt, \"so it comes under the right legislation. But I had to make a decision about where the roof finishes and what I'd see as the kind of Bond Street end - and I made a decision the whole of the place would be no-smoking, which I can do because it's private property.\" The public, he says, \"have taken a while to come round, but it's happening now. You see them putting their cigarettes out.\" </p> <p>Looking into Cabot Circus's shop windows, you quickly get a sense of hard times, and the standard retail rules they have overturned. The stores here opened a month ago, but there are already sales at Topshop and H&amp;M. House of Fraser, meanwhile, has reductions of as much as 50%.</p> <p>This isn't the only indication of things not being quite right. The development nudges the inner-city areas of St Pauls and St Judes, but its publicity material talks about 3.6 million people living within an hour's drive of Bristol, 59% of whom are ABC1s. \"Cabot Circus,\" it goes on, \"is a direct response to this affluence\" - which rather makes you wonder how it sits relative to the communities on its doorstep.</p> <p>Marianne Kempf is the chair of a local community organisation called St Pauls Unlimited - and once she has served notice that she is speaking in a personal capacity, out it all comes. \"This is showing up a huge financial divide,\" she says. \"When people step back from the excitement of it all, I think they'll feel slightly different. It's too gaudy. It's too corporate. It's too rich. And it's come at a very bad time. It's all very well boasting about spending \u00a312.5m on art and all the rest of it, but that looks pretty poor when people can't afford their weekly food shopping. That's not being talked about, but I think it will be.\"</p> <p>What she says next cuts straight to the quick. \"What are shops supposed to deliver? Goods. We had plenty of places doing that already. If you wanted a Woolies, there was one. If you wanted some pants, you could get some pants. It's lovely to have a choice, but it's what that choice is. And this isn't much of a choice because a lot of people can't afford it.\"</p> <p>After days spent listening to all that talk about footfall and experiential marketing, her words chime with the spirit of these anxious times that bit more convincingly - though as I wait for my train out of Bristol, I catch a conversation that suggests once the current storms have subsided, Westfield and Cabot Circus are bound to win out. A woman no older than 30 is sitting nearby, talking into her mobile. Maybe it's my age, but her words - spoken casually, as if they're the most normal thing in the world - have a slightly chilling quality about them. \"What are you doing tonight?\" she says excitedly. \"Are you going to the mall?.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Friday October 24 2008.

  "<p>Lord Myners - plain Paul until three days ago - knows about being thrown in at the deep end. Barely 20 days into his new role as City minister, Myners has already helped orchestrate a historic bail-out of the British banking system and told the bosses of three of our biggest banks that the taxpayer is taking up to \u00a337bn-worth of stakes in their business so they might survive the economic turmoil.</p> <p>The intensity of the workload has been extraordinary but there is little time to rest. Insurance companies and hedge funds are now being scrutinised. A crucial bill to update a bank regulatory system exposed by Northern Rock's collapse last year must be raced through parliament as the government tries to marshal an international response to the crisis.</p> <p>Myners, who until he took ministerial office was chairman of Guardian Media Group, which publishes the Guardian, will be in the thick of it as Alistair Darling's point man with the City. The Bank of England governor, Mervyn King, admitted this week that the banking system had been the closest to collapse since the first world war, but Myners insists: \"We are now in a much better place. That's not to say everything has been addressed. We remain alert to shocks [but] I feel we are on top of the situation in terms of anticipating where challenges could arise.\"</p> <p>His appointment on October 3 came as part of Gordon Brown's ministerial reshuffle, which also heralded Peter Mandelson's surprise return to the cabinet. Myners' involvement in Brown's emergency changes also raised eyebrows. The 60-year-old businessman, who favours open-neck shirts rather than ties, held a string of top jobs and forfeited \u00a31m of income to take on the role. As well as chairman's roles at GMG, the FTSE-100 property company Land Securities and the Tate Gallery trustees, he resigned as a director from GLG, a hedge fund that profited from placing bets that bank stocks would fall. Such short-selling is now temporarily banned by the City regulator, allowing the Conservatives to accuse Brown of hypocrisy.</p> <p>When Myners joined the government he knew he would be thrown headlong into the crisis - which had yet to reach its climax - at Britain's banks. \"I'm a minor support act for the chancellor but I knew I was coming into his team with a specific responsibility in this area.\" His immediate brief was to work with Darling to re-establish confidence in the British banking system.</p> <p><strong>Orphanage</strong></p> <p>Described as having a ferocious temper and a considerable ego, Myners has had some experience of a banking crisis before. He was a reporter at the Daily Telegraph during the banks' last big wobble in 1973. His view is that the secondary banking crisis - which affected dozens of smaller banks - \"was infinitely simpler\" than the current one. Did he get scoops? \"Yeah,\" he says. Was he a good reporter? \"I made up for lack of flair and skill with energy and hard work, and I think that's often been a feature of my life.\"</p> <p>Adopted from a Bath orphanage by a Cornish couple - he told the Guardian in the past that \"I know nothing about my natural parents; I don't wish to\" - he went to school in Truro and did a degree in education. He taught for a while, did a stint in the City and after the Telegraph, joined NM Rothschild where he spent 10 years before joining fund manager Gartmore. It was here he made his name in the City and an estimated \u00a330m fortune. In 2000 he went plural, taking several boardroom seats including the chairmanship of Marks &amp; Spencer as it faced down a potential bid from the retailer Sir Philip Green. </p> <p>The experience with Green - who said he wanted to give Myners \"a proper fucking kick in the head\" the night he dropped his bid - has left its mark on the new City minister in his frantic efforts to prop up the ailing banks. </p> <p>\"In my working life I've been through many critical days. The one that springs to mind is around the Philip Green bid for M&amp;S. This [bank rescue] is no different in that there are days of great intensity when you know that there are crucial moments,\" says Myners, who reluctantly resigned from M&amp;S after another director queried his friendship with the chief executive, Sir Stuart Rose</p> <p>At ease with the media, his answers are fluid and well rehearsed. He is quick to express an opinion. Before taking this role, he laid into the boards of British banks and criticised private equity firms. Uncharacteristically, he stumbles when asked who can be blamed for the current crisis. He starts well: \"It's a global phenomenon ... It's a situation where everybody has lessons to learn.\" On the Financial Services Authority, which admitted its poor handling of the Northern Rock affair, he says: \"Adair [Turner, FSA chairman] is talking about the need to change the way the FSA defines its role and the Treasury is working with him on that.\"</p> <p>When he gets to the Bank of England, he \"struggles\". Until three weeks ago he was a member of its Court - equivalent to a company's board. The silences speak volumes. It takes 15 seconds before he says: \"I think\"; five more to begin: \"The Bank of England has some lessons to learn ...\" before trailing off again. A minute later, he has his lines: \"The Bank of England has two core responsibilities: monetary policy and financial stability. [With] monetary policy, it has clearly performed its role to extraordinarily high standards. On financial stability, it has been hampered by the limited instruments available to it, which is one of the reasons we're proposing new legislation to give the bank more power to perform its statutory obligations,\" he says, relieved at finding the politician's answer.</p> <p><strong>Social justice</strong></p> <p>Although he says he never aspired to a political life and only joined the Labour party to take on the City minister role, he has led several government reviews. \"I've always been deeply concerned about equity and social justice,\" he says - liberal with a small l.</p> <p>He cites his role as chairman of the Low Pay Commission as evidence of his concern about pay inequality. But he rejects the idea that taxpayers' stakes in banks could be used to re-engineer the social order. \"The government doesn't have a policy objective to own banks ... they are not agencies of social change. The government has other instruments to achieve those goals.\"</p> <p>The government is forcing the bail-out banks - Royal Bank of Scotland and the combined Lloyds TSB and HBOS - to put lending back on a 2007 footing to keep the financing tap on for small business and would-be home-owners during the oncoming recession. The government will also get some say over appointments to boards and secured pledges that bosses will not get bonuses. </p> <p>The exact way the government will oversee the \u00a337bn at risk is still being ironed out, but Myners reveals a new agency is likely to be created similar to the Shareholder Executive set up in 2003 to oversee government stakes in businesses such as the Tote, Channel Four and the Met Office. It has since nationalised Northern Rock and it is not clear whether this stake will be under the new agency.</p> <p>Myners reckons the insurers and the hedge fund industry are not in the state in which the banks ended up a fortnight ago. \"We are watching those situations carefully,\" he admits, but insists the taxpayer will not have to prop them up. He puts the onus on the FSA, which he says has \"taken some major steps across all its areas of responsibility to revisit areas of capitalisation\".</p> <p>He does not take issue with the idea he has a bad temper but prefers to call himself passionate. But he is affronted by the idea that he has a big ego or is a major networker, insisting he is not a fan of cocktail parties - not least because he is being fitted with a hearing aid.</p> <p>It is not clear how long Myners, who is not taking a ministerial salary, hopes to be City minister, a role that until a year ago would have been more about defending taxing non-doms or big firms threatening to leave the UK for more relaxed tax regimes than fighting for the City's survival. He is doing it out of a sense of public duty as his wealth means he does not need to work. \"I just like to be involved. I love challenges and can't contemplate how one could be satisfied sitting on the beach,\" he says.</p> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born </strong>April 1 1948</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> Truro School; Institute of Education, University of London</p> <p><strong>Career</strong> Daily Telegraph (1970-74); NM Rothschild (1974-85); Gartmore (1985-2000); mmO2 (2001-04); Marks &amp; Spencer (2002-06); chairman, Guardian Media Group (2000-08); chairman, Land Securities (2006-08); Court of Bank of England (2005...#8209;08); City minister (October 2008-)</p> <p><strong>Family </strong>Married to Alison, with whom he has a son and a daughter, and three daughters from a previous marriage </p> <p><strong>Interests</strong> The arts</p>",

  "<p>Serious doubts multiplied yesterday about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan\">Pakistan</a>'s commitment to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa\">America</a>'s military campaign against al-Qaida and the Taliban after parliament overwhelmingly passed a resolution calling for dialogue with extremist groups and an end to military action.</p> <p>The new strategy, backed by all parties, emerged after a fierce debate in parliament where most parliamentarians said that Pakistan was paying an unacceptable price for fighting \"America's war\". If implemented by the government, support for Pakistan from international allies would come under severe strain, adding further instability to a country facing a spiral of violence and economic collapse.</p> <p>\"We need to prioritise our own national security interests,\" said Raza Rabbani, a leading member of the ruling Pakistan People's party. \"As far as the US is concerned, the message that has gone with this resolution will definitely ring alarm bells, vis-a-vis their policy of bulldozing Pakistan.\"</p> <p>The resolution, passed unanimously in parliament on Wednesday night demanded the abandonment of the use of force against extremists, in favour of negotiation, in what it called \"an urgent review of our national security strategy\".</p> <p>\"Dialogue must now be the highest priority, as a principal instrument of conflict management and resolution,\" said the resolution. \"The military will be replaced as early as possible by civilian law enforcement agencies.\" It also said Pakistan would pursue \"an independent foreign policy\" and, in a pointed reference to US military incursions into Pakistani territory, proclaimed that \"the nation stands united against any incursions and invasions of the homeland, and calls upon the government to deal with it effectively\".</p> <p>The force of the resolution was unclear last night, with differences in interpretation between the ruling People's party and opposition. The document is not binding on the government even though it was party to it. The army remains the ultimate arbiter of security policy. Some analysts believe that differences between the parties will see a tussle over implementation that could temper the resolution's thrust. The US response was muted, with officials saying they considered it rhetoric for domestic consumption.</p> <p>But the intense American pressure on Islamabad to take on the militants was underlined yesterday by another US missile strike inside Pakistani territory, an instance of the heavy-handed intervention that parliament railed against. The attack came in Pakistan's border area with Afghanistan, at an Islamic school being used by suspected extremists, killing 11. The madrasa was linked to Afghan Taliban commander Jalaluddin Haqqani, who has an extensive network in Pakistan.</p> <p>There have been about a dozen US missile strikes inside Pakistan since the beginning of September and a ground assault, fanning widespread anti-Americanism in the country. The US and Nato depend on Pakistan to prevent its tribal area being used as a safe haven for Afghan Taliban.</p> <p>Past attempts by Pakistan at making peace with militant groups in the tribal area have allowed them to regroup and led to a sharp increase in cross-border attacks against coalition forces in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Yesterday a US official made clear what it expected. \"Pakistan needs to and is attacking insurgents in its northern areas,\" Patrick Moon, a deputy US assistant secretary of state, said during a visit to Kabul. \"Sanctuaries for Afghanistan Taliban in Pakistan complicate our security operations. Pakistani Taliban and other extremists such as al-Qaida are posing a threat to the stability of Pakistan.\"</p> <p>Pakistan is confronting multiple crises, political, security and financial, which threaten to overwhelm the nuclear-armed country and push it into chaos. It is heading towards bankruptcy, forcing Islamabad this week to approach to the International Monetary Fund for a rescue package. But the IMF bailout could be jeopardised if Washington is not on board.</p> <p>Ordinary people complain that the country feels like it is falling apart, with a severe shortage of electricity causing blackouts of 12 hours or more in many areas, and crippling food price inflation, running at up to 100%, swelling the numbers living below the poverty line.</p> <p>The country's north-west, especially its tribal border area with Afghanistan, is under the control of Taliban and al-Qaida, who are connected to militant groups that have networks across the country. Yesterday, in what is now a typical day for Pakistan, aside from the US missile strike, eight anti-Taliban tribal leaders were killed by militants in the Orakzai part of the tribal area, and the army killed 20 fighters in Bajaur, another part of the tribal belt.</p> <p>In Swat, a valley in the north-west, the headless body was found of a policeman, previously kidnapped by Taliban, and posters went up in Swat warning women against shopping in markets, saying it was \"unIslamic\".</p> <p>\"Our country is burning,\" said Senator Khurshid Ahmad, a member of Pakistan's upper house of parliament for Jamaat-e-Islami, a mainstream religious party. \"We don't want Bush to put oil on the fire. We want to extinguish this fire.\"</p> <p>Sherry Rehman, minister for information, said the motion was a \"firm resolve to combat terrorism\". But Talat Masood, a retired general and security analyst, said: \"The army will be disappointed there was not a clear consensus. I think the army will continue with the existing policy.\" </p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>Pakistan's tribal territory, formally known as the <strong>Federally Administered Tribal Areas</strong> (Fata), is a legacy of the Raj, a 10,000 square mile sliver of territory that has become central to geopolitics and the homeland security of the US, Britain and Europe. </p> <p>The laws of Pakistan do not extend to the tribal belt, which is run under its own punitive laws and <strong>tribal custom</strong>, a system developed by the British. Fierce customs mean that men all carry guns, and guests, including al-Qaida militants, must be protected. </p> <p>Al-Qaida's leadership and thousands of Taliban escaped the US war in Afghanistan after <strong>September 11 2001</strong> by slipping into the tribal area, which runs along the border.</p> <p>Under a treaty with the tribes, the Pakistan army was not allowed to enter the Fata, but the accord broke in <strong>2004</strong> under US pressure calling for al-Qaida bases to be disrupted. This sparked a <strong>tribal insurrection</strong> and pushed the locals towards extremism, creating a <strong>Pakistani Taliban.</strong> Taliban<strong> </strong>militants killed hundreds of traditional leaders and now control most of the Fata, imposing a rough and ready <strong>Islamic law</strong>, though it is believed that most tribesmen remain moderate.</p>",
  "<p>The growth of the knife crime crisis in England and Wales is confirmed, with the figures showing a 28% rise in the number of incidents described as attempted murder with a knife.</p> <p>A similar rise - 29% - is recorded in the number of incidents described as grievous bodily harm with intent, although about one-third of this increase is put down to the change in the counting rules.</p> <p>The data comes after Monday's fatal stabbing of a 16-year-old by a group of youths outside a Liverpool youth club, which triggered a presentation by the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, to the cabinet on Tuesday. </p> <p>Smith said yesterday that 2,200 knives had been seized since the Tackling Knives Action Programme was launched in June.</p> <p>Separate knife figures have only been collected by the police since April 2007, and yesterday's statistics compare April to June 2008 with April to June 2007.

  "<p>European commission officials who worked for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/mandelson\">Lord Mandelson</a>, the business secretary, issued a misleading statement about the history of his relationship with Oleg Deripaska, the Russian billionaire, the Guardian has established.</p> <p>Mandelson's officials in Brussels, where he served as trade commissioner before returning to a role in the government earlier this month, said the two men met \"at a few social gatherings in 2006 and 2007\", but had never discussed aluminium, the main source of Deripaska's wealth.</p> <p>However, Mandelson and Deripaska were seen together at a Moscow restaurant in October 2004, after he had been appointed trade commissioner, but before he formally took up the post. A journalist spoke to both men and their companion, German Gref, who was then the Russian economics minister, and the event is also described in the blog of Benjamin Wegg-Prosser, Mandelson's former adviser and close friend.</p> <p>The statement by the European officials is understood to be based on information provided by Mandelson himself. It is unclear why the business secretary has not corrected it to reflect the earlier meetings. The disclosure that the two men had met earlier is likely to fuel Conservative demands for an investigation into the relationship between Mandelson and the Russian oligarch.</p> <p>Yesterday the Tories learned that they were themselves facing official inquiries arising out of meetings the shadow chancellor, George Osborne, had with Deripaska this summer, after the parliamentary commissioner for standards was asked to rule whether Osborne should have declared his stay at the Corfu villa of Nathaniel Rothschild.</p> <p>The Tories were also facing the threat of an investigation into foreign financing after the party accepted a \u00a36,000 donation from a US financier, Robin Saunders, through her UK investment company.</p> <p>Last night, it was also revealed that David Cameron accepted free flights to visit Rupert Murdoch on his private yacht in the eastern Mediterranean. The flights, organised by Murdoch's son-in-law, Matthew Freud, to fly Cameron and his family from Istanbul to meet Murdoch on his yacht and then back to a resort in Turkey, were declared in the parliamentary register of members interests. Conservative Central Office said last night that \"everything that needs to be declared in relation to August 16 has been properly declared\".</p> <p>Mandelson's staff in Brussels confirmed yesterday that he had told them that he met Deripaska in 2006, and they said they knew nothing of previous encounters.</p> <p>In addition to the lunchtime meeting between the two men at Moscow's Pushkin Cafe, it has been reported that Mandelson and Deripaska met for dinner at another Moscow restaurant, the Cantinetta Antinori, in January 2005.</p> <p>It has been reported that in 2005 Lord Mandelson was instrumental in easing EU tariffs on imports of Russian aluminium foil, which would have been favourable to Deripaska, but European commission officials pointed out yesterday that this decision had been taken in 2001, three years before Mandelson arrived in Brussels.</p> <p>There was no clarification from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, of which Mandelson was appointed secretary of state in Gordon Brown's reshuffle three weeks ago. A spokeswoman said: \"Peter Mandelson's social and other contacts with Oleg Deripaska over a number of years have been well rehearsed. He does not believe anything is added by giving regular updates on dates and places where they met, or in giving a retrospective running commentary of every meeting he has had with people he met during his time as EU trade commissioner.\"</p> <p>Mandelson's relationship with Deripaska had been the subject of mounting media interest until last Monday, when Rothschild sent a letter to the Times in which he disclosed that Osborne and a senior Conservative party fundraiser, Andrew Feldman, had attempted to \"solicit a donation\" from Deripaska.</p> <p>Rothschild claims that he leaked this news because Osborne, who had been his guest at a private party, broke a number of confidences in an apparent attempt to embarrass Mandelson. The result of the Times letter was that the tables were instantly turned on the Conservatives, and Osborne in particular.</p> <p>Yesterday, however, some in Westminster were questioning whether Rothschild would have destroyed his life-long friendship with Osborne, the man who may become the next chancellor, over such a relatively minor matter, or whether he wrote the letter in an attempt to protect Mandelson, or Deripaska, or both.</p> <p>Mandelson had known members of the Rothschild family for many years. Rothschild is said to have been present at the dinner in Moscow in January 2005 with Mandelson and Deripaska. The three met again last August on Corfu, where Rothschild has a villa and where Deripaska moored his \u00a380m yacht.</p>",
  "<p>What a surprise. As the credit crunch moves slightly down the headlines it is replaced as top story by a tale of shady dealings about the raising of cash for politics (Don't cross me again, warns Tory's accuser, October 23). Whatever George Osborne may or may not have done, the spectacle of our senior politicians cosying up to money men to fund party political activities should be a source of shame and embarrassment to all of us.</p> <p>Meaningful reform of political-party funding is scuppered time after time by one party or another refusing to let go of its own special funding relationships. The bill now going through parliament will do little to change the fundamental problem, which leads politicians of all persuasions to court those with money in order to fund their party. The status quo is justified by the apparent agreement across the political spectrum that people will not accept more state funding because our politicians are held in such low esteem. Well, that problem is not going to be improved by continuing this unsightly and sometimes rather seedy method of paying for our democracy.</p> <p>We need a system that is transparent and which prevents any of our political parties being beholden to particular vested interests. Crucially, we need a system which rewards those parties who seek to engage with individual voters in a way our current method of party political funding fails miserably to do.</p> <p>The Power Inquiry suggested a system which gave every voter the chance to determine who got a portion of state funding - which would be spent locally rather than consumed by party headquarters bent on expensive media campaigns. Others have different ideas. But what is certain is that if we are to have a new type of politics in this country, we need to start by reforming where the money for politics actually comes from.<br><strong>Pam Giddy</strong><br>Director, Power Inquiry </p> <p>Neat, is it not? George Osborne is alleged to be part of a Tory attempt to channel a foreign donation from a Russian billionaire to his party and the Electoral Commission immediately dismisses a request to investigate. Peter Hain goes to the commission as soon as he finds that those he trusted to run his Labour party deputy leader campaign have failed to register legal British donations within the required 30 days and the commission refers him to the police. One law for a Tory, another for Labour? No wonder many of us are so cynical.<br><strong>Karen Price</strong><br>Neath, West Glamorgan </p> <p>George Osborne's indiscreet breach of the omerta of an upper-class binge-drinking club has at least helped us all learn the difference between a superyacht and a megayacht. More importantly, their falling out has lifted a stone to uncover how our increasingly interconnected economic and political upper-class spend their money and time.</p> <p>All parties - the economic patrons and their political lapdogs - appear to have agreed a truce rather than risk damaging their collective reputation. Discretion in their discussions with each other obviously counts for more than transparency and accountability to the rest of us. Besides, now is probably not the best time for the \"have-yachts\" to rub our noses in the details of all these marvellous parties they throw for each other.</p> <p>We are used to dodgy unaccountable offshore financial arrangements, but now the politics is disappearing offshore and there seems to be nothing we can do about it. Except that the new report from the UN predicting increased social tension as global inequalities widen (Wealth gap creating a social time bomb, October 23) looks - against this shady background of unaccountable deal-making in the playgrounds of the rich - to be less a threat, and ever more a promise.<br><strong>Brian Gardner</strong><br>Glasgow </p> <p>As the kangaroo court trying George Osborne hits your front page, I am astonished that you have not taken up the far bigger and far more important task of placing the financing of US presidential election campaigns under the spotlight.

  "<p>\"Dog whistle tactics\" has become something of a political cliche, but three years ago, the term - which means campaigning on issues so high-pitched that only certain voters can hear them - was all but unheard-of.</p> <p>It took Phil Woolas, a one-time TV producer, trade union official and Labour MP, to point out that the mix of immigration and health in Michael Howard's 2005 election campaign had been developed in Australia and had a name. After a few lunches with political journalists, the idea of \"dog whistle tactics\" entered the political lexicon.</p> <p>Woolas might have been quick to spot it because he does a good line in whistling. Within 10 days of becoming immigration minister this month, Woolas went on record to say he believed immigration should be limited and the British population capped at 70 million. A little further from his brief, he also floated the possibility that the Church of England would become disestablished.</p> <p>For these two moments of political candour, Woolas was pulled from appearing on Question Time last night, a rare move that betrayed government alarm at a gaffe-prone minister.</p> <p>Yet those who know him say these are not gaffes. The former cabinet minister Peter Hain, who has known Woolas since university and whose campaign for the deputy leadership was run by the junior minister, said: \"He's astute, savvy, canny and completely aware of the 24-hour media cycle. The idea that he didn't mean his comments is wrong.\"</p> <p>Another Labour MP, John Mann, his best friend, best man and political ally since the first day at Manchester University, said he was \"never reckless and never thoughtless\". </p> <p>Back then, his greatest gaffe was a visual one - appearing on television as the National Union of Students president to push for an ultimately successful boycott of Barclays Bank, always wearing the same green ties. It was not until he was diagnosed as colour blind that he realised he hadn't been wearing the red ties beloved of Labour politicians.</p> <p>Mann says Woolas has always been a contrarian. \"Back in the 80s he took up causes of antisemitism like the campaign for Soviet Jewry. These were so-called fringe activities.\" </p> <p>Tim Gardam, the then editor of BBC's Newsnight, remembers Woolas from his time on the programme as \"very clever and very forthright\", and someone \"who would clearly become a politician\". Another producer remembers a swot. \"He was always sitting on the desk of the editor of the programme that day. A bit too buoyant.\"</p> <p>And then add some stunts. When Woolas went to become communication manager at the GMB union he brought a herd of pigs to London and got Nottinghamshire miners to shepherd them through the streets to decry the excesses of City financiers.</p> <p>Some of his comments may just be audible stunts: a way of getting heard. A green lobbyist who worked with him when he was climate change minister felt Woolas always had an eye on the story rather than policy - defending genetically modified food against Prince Charles and the green lobby.</p> <p>But these tactics do not seem to be accidents. The Liberal Democrat MEP Chris Davies, who fought Woolas in a byelection, remembers a man in control. He said: \"He was archetypal new Labour - he never expressed anything from the heart. So he has either now escaped the shackles of new Labour or is being calculating to the last punctuation mark.\"</p> <p>The calculation would be that his constituency has a high proportion of white working-class voters alienated by immigration. While ministers have started to raise this problem in the last few years, Woolas said seven years ago that Labour would lose out to the BNP unless it did more to \"create a country at ease with itself\". More recently, he has raised the possibility that the Muslim Pakistani community was fuelling birth defects by intermarrying between first cousins. </p> <p>Mann says his friend is simply more in touch with real voters than the metropolitan elite. \"He's the politician who I regard to be most in touch with British people, friend and foe alike. What he was saying was quite clear and he ought to be left to carry on saying these things.

  "<p>Misery swept through the American property market as the number of houses facing repossession shot up by 71% in the third quarter of the year, leaving more than 750,000 homeowners in danger of eviction.</p> <p>As the credit crunch tightened its grip, many more people fell behind on mortgage repayments. A million foreclosures are expected by the end of the year, amounting to a third of properties for sale.</p> <p>Figures from the research firm RealtyTrac showed that previously booming markets in California, Florida and Arizona were the worst hit. But there was a shaft of light as foreclosure filings slipped by 12% in September, largely because of legislation slowing the process of repossession. </p> <p>Each repossession has a knock-on effect as vacant properties attract vandalism and fall into disrepair, lowering the value of neighbouring homes. The federal deposit insurance corporation has calculated that, on average, a foreclosure cuts $220,000 (\u00a3137,000) off the value of nearby property.</p> <p>Top of the table for foreclosures is Stockton, a city east of San Francisco, where banks filed repossession documents on 3.69% of properties during the third quarter. The rise in foreclosures emerged as the US government reported the sharpest monthly drop in home prices for 17 years.</p> <p>There was further evidence of the gloomy American economy in falling profits at the parcel delivery company UPS and the hotels firm Starwood, which owns the Sheraton chain.</p>",
  "<p>Children of famous parents often find themselves under a certain amount of pressure. But when the parent is a dead singer who changed the face of popular culture, and when the children - and grandchildren - have followed him into the family business, things can get very complicated. Just ask Shelton Williams. \"If you're walkin' round town and seein' a picture, or hearin' a piece o' music, sometimes you get a good feelin' of, 'That's part o' my family, and I'm proud o' that,'\" says Williams as he leans over a coffee table in the lobby of a Nashville hotel. \"But if it's a real person? That's where it gets a little heavier. Sometimes I'll be at the Bluegrass Inn,\" - a live music hangout - \"an' some drunk'll come up, sayin', 'Your dad's an asshole, an' I hear you are too.'\"</p> <p>Williams, 35, a long-haired, tattooed, rake-thin singer and guitarist who fronts the extreme metal outfit Assjack and plays drums in a band with Pantera's Phil Anselmo, is better known by what is almost his alter ego, the country, punk and \"hellbilly\" artist Hank Williams III. He is the son of country-rock superstar Randall Williams - Hank Williams Jr - while Randall's dad was Hiram, the first Hank Williams. The son and grandson have both, to varying degrees at different times, felt the full weight of Hank Senior's considerable legacy.</p> <p>During a brief career that ended when he died, aged 29, in the back of a car being driven between gigs on New Year's Day, 1953, Hank Williams wrote and recorded a catalogue of material that is one of the most significant contributions to the canon of American popular song. He was feted as the \"Hillbilly Shakespeare\", a writer and performer whose simple songs of heartbreak and hard-won pleasures spoke to and for the people of rural America, but expanded country music's reach beyond its core constituency.</p> <p>Between his pinched, browbeaten vocals and the stinging steel guitar-led arrangements from his band, the Drifting Cowboys, Hank Sr seemed a study in lonesome desolation. The Vincent van Gogh of pop music, he cemented the notion of the tortured artist that remains at the heart of rock mythology. Frequently portrayed as a haunted loner at odds with the world, he suffered from a lifelong undiagnosed spinal defect, the pain from which he sought to self-medicate with alcohol and quack remedies.</p> <p>The Williams family's responses to the challenges their birthright has posed form the absorbing backbone to Family Tradition, an exhibition running until the end of 2009 at Nashville's Country Music Hall of Fame. Alongside instruments, costumes and memorabilia loaned by the family, archive performance footage and extensive videotaped interviews with family members tell the stories, while user-activated touchscreens allow for flicking through the pages of several huge, never-before-seen scrapbooks, kept by Audrey, Hank's wife and manager.</p> <p>The exhibition has three distinct themes. There's that of Hank and Audrey, his music and her business mind, and how, together, they helped define country music's parameters. And there's the ongoing narrative of the family Hank either hardly had time to know, or never met - his stepdaughter, Lycrecia, who was 11 when he died; Randall, who was only three; Jett, the illegitimate daughter born days after his death; and Randall's five children, three of whom (Hank III, Holly and Hillary) have followed father and grandfather into the music business. But the fascinating heart of the exhibition is its investigation of the real legacy Hank Sr bequeathed his progeny - that of going against the grain.</p> <p>The original Hank Williams provided a textbook study in nonconformity and rebellion. So rather than reworking the well-worn Hank hagiography, Family Tradition puts Hank Sr in his proper context: at the head of a family who, to varying degrees, seem to delight in rubbing the country establishment up the wrong way.</p> <p>When Hank Jr crossed country with the southern boogie of Lynyrd Skynyrd and Alabama and had hits with Dixie On My Mind or All My Rowdy Friends Are Comin' Over Tonight (used as the theme song to live Monday night US TV coverage of gridiron football since 1984), he was cocking a snook at the Nashville institutions that were reluctant to embrace his father in life but beatified him in death. When he survived a fall down a mountain that broke every bone in his skull and required extensive plastic surgery, he was adding a new chapter to the Williams family book of staring down the bad times. And when Hank III releases records like his new LP, Damn Right Rebel Proud, that have to be censored before Walmart will stock them, and claims, in a chorus of one of his rebel-rousing anthems, that he's \"here to put the dick in Dixie/ And the cunt back in country\", he's clearly flying that same flag. But as much as it's a unifying trait, it's a tradition that has threatened to tear the family apart.</p> <p>\"My relationship with my dad will always be strained,\" Shelton affirms, \"but that just goes to show, I guess, that I'm doin' a pretty good job of bein' myself, and bein' a rebel. Even though it [the Wiliams legacy] is a huge burden, it doesn't feel like it to me. I would say it was a lot rougher on Hank Williams Jr than it was on me, as far as people sayin', 'Oh, you're not as good as your daddy.'\"</p> <p>For Lycrecia Williams, the question raised by outsiders has been about her very place in the family. \"I get a little ill sometimes when they say 'Stepdaughter, stepdaughter, stepdaughter',\" she says. \"By law, that's what I am - I realise that. But not really. He was my father in every sense of the word. As I was growin' up, after daddy passed away, everybody kept talkin' about, 'He was drunk, he stayed high, he did this and that.' I used to think to myself, 'You know, I don't remember Daddy like that.' Of course, I was a child, and I can't tell you how he was to other people. I can only tell you how he was to me.\"</p> <p>Lycrecia, 67, was reluctant to contribute to the exhibition until she had been assured that her mother's place in the Williams story was going to be reassessed. In most accounts Audrey is painted as a domineering woman oblivious to his gifts, whose cold and calculating personality broke his heart and informed his bleakest songs. But that picture is not one Lycrecia finds easy to recognise. \"I really don't know if he wrote all these sad songs about mother or not,\" she says. \"They had happy times too, they wasn't fussin' an' fightin' an' carryin' on all the time. He was kind of laid-back, but mother knew how great he was and how talented he was, so she did the business end of it. She played an extremely large part in daddy's fame.\"</p> <p>Hank Williams' reputation as one of most important figures in country music history has never seemed stronger. His image and his music are traded on throughout Nashville, but the problematic parts of his story are conveniently forgotten; and those who follow in his footsteps too often go unrecognised by an industry that prides polity and polish over heart and soul.</p> <p>\"Hank made history when he passed on, and those that hated him all of a sudden started lovin' him,\" Hank III agrees. \"Not everybody's perfect, as much as the Country Music Association wants you to be clean and pretty. I don't know if I'll ever officially be part of all that. I'm just doin' what's in the bloodline.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Family Tradition is at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, Nashville, until December 31 2009.

  "<p>A unspoken etiquette exists for the rock star who re-emerges after a long period out of the limelight. Their rehabilitation is dependent on them appearing chastened, humbled and educated by their wilderness years. They should be modest about their successes and sanguine about their failures. They are expected to have conquered their demons and to see a lot of their former selves in Amy Winehouse. They are required to retell stories from their dissolute glory days for the benefit of the journalist's Dictaphone and to offer assurances that such behaviour is firmly in their past, for the benefit of the record label executives who've given them another chance. </p> <p>Among those recently given another chance is Grace Jones, promoting her first new album in 19 years. Her career didn't exactly grind to a halt following 1989's disappointing Bulletproof Heart - she continued performing live, but certainly in reduced circumstances. Her highest-profile British appearance was 2006's Jones Jones Jones concert in Cardiff. It broke the world record for the number of people with the same surname gathered in one place, but it's hard not to feel that appearing alongside Dai Jones - evergreen star of SC4's farming programme Cefn Gwlad - is a disappointing way for the former queen of Studio 54 to earn a living.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Jones seems disinclined to play by the usual comeback rules. There's not a hint of penitence nor hard-won wisdom in her interviews: if anything, she seems even more demented than in her Russell Harty-thumping heyday. Journalists seldom get any sense out of her, but they always get a story. In one recent encounter Jones got wildly pissed on sambucca, tried to cop off with the female journalist, then ran off down the road flapping her arms \"like a bat\" and howling. The problem for her new collaborators isn't just the usual comeback conundrum of making something that lives up to the back catalogue, although that's a particularly tough call in Jones' case, because her back catalogue has stubbornly refused to date: you might expect music the Face magazine considered the dernier cri in 1981 to have weathered rather badly - those Blue Rondo A La Turk albums certainly don't sound so great these days - but like the woman who made them, Warm Leatherette and Nightclubbing seem spookily immune to the ravages of time. It's the challenge of making an album that lives up to Jones herself at 60.</p> <p>The team behind Hurricane is weird enough: it stretches from Sly and Robbie to Phillip Sheppard, currently visiting professor at the Oxford Cello School and is helmed by Jones' current paramour, the fourth Viscount Wimborne. During Hurricane's best moments - all during the album's first half - they come up with music befitting the uniqueness of their employer. The gripping opener This Is supports Jones' voice, switching between a Jamaican-accented growl and her patent stentorian Nico-goes-disco style with a dancehall-inspired beat and squalls of Robert Fripp-ish guitar. Corporate Cannibal devises a suitably weird hybrid of nu-metal and dub, with the distorted guitar pushed to the background and swamped beneath echoing electronic effects. Equally, there's the pleasing sense that Jones herself wants to push herself into new areas. Considering she spent the 80s trying to convince the world she was from another planet, you learn a surprising amount about her upbringing from Williams Blood and I'm Crying (Mother's Tears): the latter, for some reason, punctuating the moving saga of Jones' relationship with her mother with the sound of someone squeezing a squeaky toy.</p> <p>But after a tough, thrilling first half, Hurricane suddenly seems to run out of puff, as if exhausted by the effort of trying to keep up with its star. The sound of Tricky muttering away - and, at one stage, making a noise that sounds suspiciously like someone hawking up a greenie - can't stop the title track from meandering. The more surprising musical hybrids are replaced by imitations of the reggae sound minted on the albums Jones recorded at Nassau's Compass Point studios. It's perfectly done, but marked by a creeping pointlessness: why would you put on Well Well Well or Love You to Life when you could listen to her peerless 1980 cover of Chrissie Hynde's Private Life?</p> <p>But if Hurricane isn't a triumph, it's a distinct improvement on sharing a stage with Dai Jones. It starts strongly, but peters out, delivering a kind of Sealed Knot of Jones' classic style. Of course, delivering a kind of Sealed Knot re-enactment of an artist's classic style is exactly what most comeback albums do these days. But, as we've already established, Grace Jones seems far too strange to adhere to the usual rules.</p>",
  "<p>The signal weird moment of the last week in entertainment and politics (which are the same thing, as we shall see) was the simultaneous appearance on Saturday Night Live of Sarah Palin, the laughing stock of literate America, and Josh Brolin, whose performance in W had just opened nationwide. And this only moments after Palin and her SNL doppelganger Tina Fey had slunk past each other on stage - a double-take moment straight out of Multiplicity or Dead Ringers.</p> <p>Then there was John McCain's return voyage to the hotseat of the David Letterman show after ducking out of a previous appearance. McCain fancies himself the model for Maverick, the hotshot flyer in Top Gun, and certainly there is a similar air of homoeroticism wafting around McCain's male inner circle. On Letterman, however, he was manfully staging his own McCain Mutiny against reality itself, shifting in his seat, defending Palin, badmouthing his opponent, and doing everything short of clacking Captain Queeg's silver ball-bearings in his cupped palm.</p> <p>The election is full of these bizarre moments where showbiz trumps the news - the most brutal interrogations McCain has yet faced have been on Letterman, the housewives' coffee-klatsch show The View, and with Ellen Degeneres - and the campaign is so filled with U-turns, red herrings, cliffhangers and serial climaxes that one barely needs go near the multiplex for white-knuckle entertainment. Just keeping up with Palin's alter egos - the French populist Pierre Poujade and Australia's Pauline Hanson in politics; Tracy Flick, Marge Gunderson, Peggy Hill (and Tina Fey's spoof) in fiction - is enough to set your mind reeling.</p> <p>And movie references are ever near at hand. When the economy collapsed, I thought of Alan Pakula's 1981 financial thriller Rollover, in which the Arabs withdraw every dime from American banks; the film closes with a global montage of runs on banks, food riots and collapsing societies - par-TAY! The most harrowing predictions of the slump's possible aftermath made me rent Blindness and Children of Men, and hunger after another viewing of Mad Max II. I'm hoping the forthcoming adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's The Road will furnish me with plenty of post-apocalyptic survival tips (memo to self: pack crossbow, wolf-repellent and cyanide capsules).</p> <p>The self-immolation of the Republican party resembles nothing so much as the death throes of the Terminator in T2: Judgment Day (and that's what this is for the GOP's current incarnation). As the liquid metal monster is consumed in a vat of molten steel, all of the identities it has assumed - cop, dog, stepmom- burst one last time to the surface like a satanic greatest-hits medley, each flickering to life for a moment before issuing a savage, horrifying sound, like vomiting through a scream, before the lava sucks them under. The same is happening to the Republicans as they play the race card, the terrorist card, the elitist card and the anti-American card against their opponent. It is a magnificent process to behold, better than football, better than porn, better than T2, even.</p> <p>Oddly, we've heard little this season of that perennial electoral bete noire, Liberal Hollywood, perhaps because this year the celebrity-political imbalance is so stark. While the mass of household names long ago pledged for Obama, McCain must settle for the likes of Gary Sinise, Patricia Heaton and the increasingly intemperate far-rightie Jon Voight. The Dem-GOP Celebrity Imbalance Ratio can be expressed thus: Alec Baldwin (D); Stephen Baldwin (R). It's a rout.</p> <p>Add to that the antihagiography-cum-celluloid casket that is W., and an excellent documentary, Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story, which arrives just in time to chronicle the birth-pangs of Rovean politics (Atwater was Karl Rove's mentor) and to serve as their death-knell, and, well, you have quite the spectacle.</p> <p>No wonder people are calling this election \"a Referendum on Reality\".</p>",
  "<p>Alan Johnson, the health secretary, was accused of jumping the gun yesterday when he claimed that the NHS in England had achieved its objective of reducing the maximum wait for treatment to 18 weeks.</p> <p>He said the service hit the target for the first time in August, when patients were treated faster than at any time in the NHS's 60-year history. He coupled the claim with evidence from the Health Protection Agency that the number of cases of Clostridium difficile infection in the three months to June was 38% less than in the same period last year.</p> <p>Labour pledged in its 2005 manifesto that no patient in England would wait more than 18 weeks for an operation. In November, the government said it was unrealistic to expect all patients could be treated within the deadline because some might choose to wait longer. Ministers redefined the target to require all trusts to treat 90% of inpatients and 95% of outpatients within 18 weeks. Across England during August, 90.2% of inpatients and 95.3% of outpatients were treated within 18 weeks. </p> <p>Johnson acknowledged, however, that more than half the trusts in England had not yet hit their individual targets.</p> <p>Andrew Lansley, the shadow health secretary, said: \"The government's approach of simply moving the goalposts in order that they can hit the target completely undermines confidence in their ability to deliver.\"</p>",
  "<p>What challenging technological feat takes six months, four technicians and several dozen miles of driving? Why, fixing a cracked seal in a fridge door in Bedfordshire. </p> <p>Julia Crole had the foresight to insure her appliance through Electrolux's Service Force scheme and the company swiftly dispatched a technician to replace the door. Alas, the new part wouldn't accommodate the bottle shelf so a new door and shelf were ordered. After weeks of Crole's telephoning the part arrived - and the shelf didn't fit. Another door and shelf were ordered but three months passed before they arrived with a third fitter. The shelf didn't fit. </p> <p>Another month passed. This time Service Force said it would check the fit of the shelf before delivering the new parts and the manager confirmed that he personally had inserted it successfully. So along came a fourth fitter - bearing a broken shelf. Someone had evidently fought to wedge it into place and cracked it. A new one would be ordered. </p> <p>At this point Crole contacted the Guardian and miracles began to occur. Electrolux expressed its mortification at the delays and within a week Crole received a brand new fridge, complete with door and shelf.</p> <p>This month I recounted the case of a female doctor who found that a travel company computer system would recognise doctors only as male. Others have had similar experiences. \"Try telling online software you are both female and 'Revd Canon',\" writes Pat Lyes-Wilsdon. \"Sometimes it's mandatory to give a title, in which case I'll grudgingly choose Ms - but there are worse things, including the time my own bank ran a security check on the debit card I'd been punishing all morning and left me standing in the queue in Boots while one of its operators insisted that a female person presenting a card with 'Revd Canon' on it must by definition be using a stolen card.\"</p>",

  "<p>This was not quite the European stage Gareth Barry imagined he would be appearing on this season but there was no sign of disappointment on the face of the England international last night as his well taken goal seconds before the interval gave <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/astonvilla\">Aston Villa</a> a deserved victory over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/ajax\">Ajax</a>. Outplayed for periods in the first half, Villa were in control thereafter as Martin O'Neill's side collected the three points that provides the perfect platform to progress from Group F.</p> <p>Ajax were not without their opportunities to bring parity, Urby Emanuelson propelling a low drive from 25 yards which Brad Friedel clawed to safety, but Villa always seemed the more likely side to score again on a night when this famous old stadium reverberated with noise. That moment might have arrived in the second half when Leonardo Vitor Santiago hauled down Gabriel Agbonlahor in the area, but Thomas Einwaller, the Austrian referee, waved away the appeals. It was a reprieve for Ajax, although not one that they could exploit.</p> <p>Marco van Basten's side enjoyed more possession in the early periods but it was Villa, so suited to playing on the counterattack, who looked the more threatening in the final third. With John Carew rested after O'Neill reported he was suffering from fatigue, the onus was on James Milner and Ashley Young to provide penetration from the flanks. The latter delivered, with his cut-back encouraging Barry to dispatch a left-foot first-time shot beyond Kenneth Vermeer.</p> <p>With Ajax playing neat triangles in midfield and providing evidence of their threat from set pieces when Thomas Vermaelen darted across at the near post to nod Emanuelson's corner beyond Friedel to cancel out Martin Laursen's eighth-minute opener, there was an expectation the Amsterdam side would crank up the pressure on Villa in the second half. O'Neill, however, identified Villa's weakness and by pushing Barry into a more advanced role after the interval he was able to prevent the Ajax midfield from controlling the ball. As a result, the game turned in Villa's favour.</p> <p>\"I am absolutely delighted,\" said the Villa manager. \"I thought we were excellent and that we deserved to win. We should have had a penalty kick; the only two people in the ground who missed it were the referee and the linesman. That would have given us confidence. We were well aware of Ajax's capabilities. They're a very fine passing team and just after the equaliser they had a good spell. But I also thought we were playing too deep and I rectified that in the second half.\"</p> <p>O'Neill singled out Agbonlahor for special praise, the Villa manager describing the forward's performance up front on his own as a \"masterclass\". The England Under-21 international was taken off on a stretcher in the closing minutes after colliding with Vermeer but O'Neill insisted the striker had no more than cuts and bruises across his knees. He might also be running on empty when he is examined the morning after he worked assiduously across the front line to provide a focal point for Villa's attacks.</p> <p>For all that, it was a defender who gave Villa the lead, with Laursen's goal in the eighth minute from Ashley Young's corner suggesting that Ajax had not done their homework on the threat O'Neill's side pose from set pieces. It could be argued that Villa were also negligent in that department, with Vermaelen profiting from a zonal marking system that afforded the Ajax players a free run on goal. In the end, Van Basten was left to lament Klaas-Jan Huntelaar's failure to turn in another Emanuelson corner moments after the equaliser.</p> <p>\"I thought in the first half we played rather well,\" said the Ajax manager. \"It was just a pity that we conceded before the break. In the second half we didn't play football any more. We played long ball and we made Aston Villa stronger and stronger. It was our mistake.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Republican party showed signs of disarray yesterday over the prospect of a Barack Obama presidential victory being matched by sweeping gains on November 4 by the Democrats in Congress on a scale not witnessed since the 1930s.</p> <p>Figures show the Democrats outspending the Republicans 4-1 in congressional races across the country.

  "<p>With all due respect to my esteemed colleague Jonathan Freedland, I feel compelled to contest his theory that the belle of this year's Republican ball <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/23/sarahpalin-uselections2008\">will be back in the presidential chase</a> come 2012.</p> <p>A victory for John McCain would certainly give Palin the chance to rehabilitate her approval ratings and consolidate her appeal to the conservative base in preparation for a future presidential run. But if Barack Obama becomes president next year \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14838.html\">it's a bigger assumption</a> than most liberals would like to think right now \u2013 Palin is going to have a devil of a time making a viable bid for the White House.</p> <p>The first factor holding her back is the same enemy that Palin often decries before her rapt audiences: the media. Every publication from the New Yorker to <a href=\"http://www.fieldandstream.com/article_gallery.jsp?ID=1000022649\">Field and Stream</a> magazine descended on <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/sarah-palin/story/514173.html\">rural Wasilla, Alaska</a> after Palin joined the Republican ticket last month, and the resulting crush of damning press created a string of ready-made attack adverts for any possible opponent in 2012.</p> <p>Imagine if John Edwards, the 2004 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, had emerged victorious as his party's nominee this year. </p> <p>Even if Edwards's infidelity had not become public, Republicans would be subjecting him to a daily re-litigation of the same battles that brought down the Kerry-Edwards ticket four years ago. His campaign would be watched hawkishly for the slightest hint of a reversal on the issues \u2013 and so would Palin's in 2012. </p> <p>Given that the Alaska governor can barely keep her positions straight over a period of weeks on topics as sensitive as military action inside Pakistan and judicial refinancing of mortgages, you'd better believe that Democrats would salivate at the chance to fact-check her four years from now. Not to mention, operatives will be watching to see whether Palin's pricey designer clothes show up at the Salvation Army after the election.</p> <p>The second drag on Palin's political future is her state. Yes, Alaska is certainly remote and offers scant opportunities for national political exposure. But most importantly, it also <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/08/a-look-at-sarah.html\">lacks a substantial fundraising base</a> from which Palin can extract the cold, hard cash necessary to run for president four years from now.</p> <p>Her best chance to build a network over the next four years as governor is courting the major oil companies. But Palin was correct in noting that her independent-minded approach to the Alaska natural gas pipeline turned off Exxon and the other energy giants.<br> Sarah Barracuda is certain to remain in the good graces of Bill Kristol, Fred Barnes and other A-list conservative pundits who are <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/10/27/081027fa_fact_mayer?currentPage=2\">enthralled by her stage presence</a>. (Peggy Noonan, as it happens, is far from a Palin fan these days.)</p> <p>Still, even if Kristol &amp; Co can give her entr\u00e9e to the Washington power elite \u2013 something tells me McCain won't be in the mood to share after a loss this year \u2013 Palin is bound to watch her approval ratings suffer in Alaska as she openly plans another run at the White House.</p> <p>On the subject of approval ratings, they happen to be the third factor imperilling Palin's presidential future. Polling is generally untrustworthy on the details, but Palin's numbers paint a distressing picture: the more voters get to know her, the less they like her.</p> <p>After Palin stormed onto the national stage with her combative convention speech last month, she boasted a <a href=\"http://people-press.org/report/?pageid=1375\">54% positive rating</a>. Five weeks later, her approval rating <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aYI5UQWvIChI&amp;refer=home\">had fallen to 44%</a>, compared with 60% for Democratic No 2 Joe Biden.</p> <p>Voter perceptions of Palin also have suffered back in Alaska, albeit on a smaller scale. Does anyone think the bespectacled governor will be able to return home quietly for two years of fighting environmental regulations? Palin had better start getting used to the pesky media tracking her every move on the local level, particularly her clashes with Alaska critics <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/14/palin-criticized-in-alaska/?pagemode=print\" ?>Andree McLeod</a>, <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/politics/story/497064.html\">Andrew Halcro</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.blogtalkradio.com/2008/09/09/anne-kilkenny-on-blogtalkradio-this-afternoon\">Anne Kilkenny</a>. </p> <p>Four years from now, Palin is unlikely to be enjoying the 80%-plus approval that gilded her emergence this autumn, especially if she faces a difficult re-election fight in 2010. </p> <p>That brings me to the fourth and final reason that Palin 2012 is less of a sure thing than Freedland and others believe. Palin's term expires in 2010, the same month that Republican Lisa Murkowski must defend her Senate seat. </p> <p>Having spectacularly unseated Murkowski's father, Frank, in order to become governor, Palin may well decide that knocking off another Murkowski is her best path to broader power. The Senate would be the best perch for Palin to keep an eye on a potential President Obama if she wants to run in 2012 \u2013 which would surely depend on how vulnerable Obama is to a successful challenge by that point.</p> <p>But wait: Palin would first have to win that Senate seat. And although she energises the conservative base now, she does so largely through prepared talking points, depicting Obama as a \"pal\" of terrorists and McCain as \"the only man\" who can defend America. The next several years will test her ability to delve into the more substantive critiques that are required of both Senate and presidential candidates. </p> <p>Before Palin and her fans in the <a href=\"http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/10/palin_1.php\">media</a>-<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/sarahpalin/3242610/Republicans-considering--Sarah-Palin-2012-presidential-campaign.html\">political</a>-<a href=\"http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_plank/archive/2008/10/22/prediction-palin-in-2012.aspx\">industrial</a> complex get psyched about a 2012 run, she'd do well to bone up on policy.

  "<p>With plenty to prove at home in the league, if Spurs thought salvation would be forthcoming in Europe they were mistaken. Beaten by just two goals, despite being reduced to 10 men, the damage to both their morale and the rest of their season may be of far more consequence.</p> <p>Perhaps the question of which competition Juande Ramos considers the more important \u2014 domestic or Europe \u2014 was answered by the presence of the fragile Ledley King in the starting line-up. Absent against Stoke when expected to play, tonight he started and Spurs' defence benefited from both the level of order he instils and his reading of the game \u2014 though perhaps not to the degree that the manager may have hoped.</p> <p>The Tottenham defence still looks very much a work in progress, but it is perhaps even further back that their problems start. Heurelho Gomes has hardly inspired confidence this season and he was caught flapping at a corner early in the game. Some 20 minutes later, it was his moment of madness that meant Spurs went into the dressing room a goal down at half-time. After miscontrolling a back-pass, he found himself faced with the onrushing Fabio Quagliarella. Rather than send the ball into touch, the goalkeeper wrapped his arms around the attacker, sending him \u2014 albeit theatrically \u2014 sprawling to the ground.</p> <p>The penalty was clear, the resulting yellow card could have been worse, and Antonio Di Natale's assured strike low into the left-hand corner heralded a spell of panic in the Spurs back line. For the following 10 minutes, shots and crosses were fired at Gomes from distance \u2014 each one punched, rather than caught, with increasing unease by the nervous keeper. His only saving grace came midway through the second half when Di Natale raced on to a through ball to find Gomes caught in no man's land. Only frantic back-pedalling before an acrobatic dive prevented the striker's neat chip from doubling Udinese's tally.</p> <p>For the first quarter of an hour, Spurs had ploughed an increasingly productive-looking right-wing furrow. It was from there that Jermaine Jenas ran through the Udinese defence and chipped to an unmarked Darren Bent \u2014 only to see the striker head a ball to the keeper that would have been more appropriate as a back-pass. Minutes later, Gareth Bale worked the same right-hand channel, before Aaron Lennon stung the Udinese keeper Samir Handanovic's palms after racing from the right touchline into the box.</p> <p>Lennon was the prong of many of Tottenham's attacks in the first half. However, when a promising dribble though the middle of pitch ended with the winger tripping over the ball at his feet, it provided an incident that marked both the potential and subsequent farce that has summed up much of Spurs' season.</p> <p>As Tottenham should know by now, it never rains but it pours. When Jamie O'Hara was handed his first yellow card for a poor tackle in the 55th minute, only to lunge into another late tackle on Alexis Sanchez 52 seconds later, Ramos must have known the worst was coming. That the Udinese player tumbled dramatically into touch hardly helped but the referee was in no mood to reward such naivety with leniency.</p> <p>From there, Spurs were reeling. Luka Modric's introduction at half-time became an irrelevance as the midfield became over-run, while Bale's inexperience manifested itself in a series of bad decisions, mis-kicks and errors at the back. His insistence on shooting from the free-kicks with which he was entrusted, rather than finding better-placed players in the area, must have been a particular frustration for his manager.</p> <p>Late in the second half, with only minutes left on the clock, Bent was provided with another chance to head his team into the game. Giovani Dos Santos's good work to provide the cross \u2014 again down the right \u2014 was wasted, though. With men pushed up to chase an equaliser, there was an inevitability about Udinese's second. Finding themselves with four on two, it was simple for the Italian club's strikers to play around the Tottenham defence. The finish, from substitute Simone Pepe, bounced in off the post and with it went Spurs' hopes.</p>",

  "<p>Amid the many conspiracy theories swirling around the US presidential race \u2014 Barack Hussein Obama's Islamist takeover, say, or John \"Bush\" McCain's plans to steal the election \u2014 a truly-sinister confluence of events has largely gone unnoticed.</p> <p>Some see the devil's hand at play in a contest that, whatever its outcome, will see a powerful group regain control of the White House on November 4.</p> <p>Membership of the group extends across the political divide and into US public life, from the media to arts to finance. Apart from both Obama and McCain, it includes the TV mogul Oprah Winfrey, the Nobel peace prize laureate Al Gore, New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and Homer Simpson's neighbour, Ned Flanders.</p> <p>The driving force of the movement is not so much political ideology as dexterity. When President Bush quits the White House in January, America will see a fundamental shift, not from right to left, but from right-handed to left-handed.</p> <p>Both Obama and McCain are sinistral \u2014 lefties to you and me \u2014 in contrast to the present incumbent of the Oval office. One of them will be the fourth left-handed president out of the five past holders of the world's most-powerful office, a fact that has intrigued neurologists and confounded probability theorists. </p> <p>Obama or McCain will become the 44th US president, and within that distinguished company will be the eighth known to be left-handed. The victor will become the sixth leftie out of 12 presidents since the end of the second world war, stretching back to Harry Truman.</p> <p>The other postwar lefties-in-chief are Gerald Ford, the ambidextrous Ronald Reagan, George Bush Sr and Bill Clinton. Since 1974 the only right-handed presidents have been Jimmy Carter and the outgoing Bush. </p> <p>Roughly one in 10 of the population is left-handed, so to have four out of five recent incumbents in the top job drawn from that group is striking: the probability is 0.00009. </p> <p>Some statisticians would say it is just a coincidence that over time will be evened out. Certainly, the prevalence has been lower among the 12 postwar British prime ministers; only two of them, Churchill and Callaghan, were left-handed. But Daniel Geschwind, a professor of human genetics at UCLA, thinks it is beyond coincidence. \"Six out of the past 12 presidents is statistically significant, and probably means something,\" he said.</p> <p>Geschwind points out that there are established differences in brain patterns. The language function lies in the left hemisphere of the brain for 98% of right-handed people, but is on the left for only about 60% of left-handers. About 10% of lefties have their language function on the right hemisphere \u2014 far more than their right-handed brethren \u2014 and about 30% straddle both sides.</p> <p>How these factors play out in practice is only thinly understood, but it may help to explain why there are a disproportionate number of left-handed maths professors at MIT, for instance, as well as artists from Michelangelo to Paul Klee, not to mention Winfrey, Gore and Bloomberg.</p> <p>Left-handed US presidents go back to James Garfield, who, legend has it, could write in Latin with one hand and simultaneously write the same sentence in Greek with the other.</p> <p>The rollcall has not always been a happy one. Garfield was assassinated in 1881 (though the assumption that left-handed people are prone to an early grave has been debunked). Herbert Hoover was the second confirmed left-handed US president, and we know all too well what happened under him.</p> <p>Fidel Castro is also a member of the club, as is Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>Over the centuries, southpaws \u2014 as they have been known since the early days of baseball \u2014 have had a rough ride. Etymology tells the story. \"Sinister\" comes from the Latin word for left, later taking on the connotation of evil or unlucky.</p> <p>According to the Left-Handers Club, a support group based in Surrey, the devil is almost always portrayed as left-handed. The basics of life, from desks to scissors and computer mouses, are geared to the right-handed majority. Which is why Ned Flanders in the TV series The Simpsons set up a shop called the Leftorium.</p> <p>Kristy Ainslie, a biomedical engineer in San Francisco, knows all about these inconveniences from personal experience. Eight months ago she set up a Facebook group, Lefties for Obama, partly as a satire on the way Obama has been depicted as someone outside the mainstream.</p> <p>She thinks there may be something to the presidential cluster of lefties: \"When you are left-handed you have your own unique perspective and have to be -willing to stand out from the crowd. That's not bad training for a president,\" she said.<br><em>Ed Pilkington is right-handed</em></p>",
  "<p>Is it time to \"normalise aid relations\" with Burma's notoriously closed and paranoid military dictatorship? According to the <a href=\"http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=5734&amp;l=1\">International Crisis Group (ICG)</a>, it might be.</p> <p>In a report released this week it says: \"The international community should build on the unprecedented cooperation between the Myanmar government and humanitarian agencies following cyclone Nargis and reverse longstanding, counterproductive aid policies.\" </p> <p>It goes on: \"Donors should end aid restrictions, which have seen Myanmar receiving 20 times less assistance than similar countries \u2013 and which have weakened, not strengthened, the forces for change.\"</p> <p>The initial response of the Burmese government to the cyclone, which hit last May, killing more 100,000, shocked the world. International agencies and local donors were stopped from delivering aid, putting the lives and welfare of 100,000s of people in jeopardy. France's foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, invoked the \"responsibility to protect\" doctrine at the UN, threatening to deliver aid forcibly if necessary. French and US warships moved to the area. Britain's foreign secretary, David Miliband, spoke of sending HMS Westminster and hinted at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/15/hismastersvoice1\">military action</a>. Journalists such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/11/cyclonenargis.burma\">Nick Cohen salivated at the thought of another \"humanitarian war\"</a>.</p> <p>In fact these theatrical gestures were of little practical help for those involved in the relief effort and, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/14/droptheairdrop\">Oxfam's Barbara Stocking pointed out</a> at the time, the call for military action was basically a distraction from the real task of getting the government's permission to allow aid workers into the country.</p> <p>Burma's immediate neighbours, working through the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), gave the lead both in coordinating the international aid effort and in persuading the Junta to drop its restrictions. Visas and travel permits today are easier and faster to get than before. By late July, John Holmes, the UN emergency relief coordinator declared, \"This is now a normal international relief operation\". </p> <p>The ICG's latest report argues that the recent post-cyclone cooperation has proved it is possible to work with the military regime on humanitarian issues and to deliver assistance in an \"effective and accountable way\". John Virgoe, its south-east Asia project director, says: \"Political reform remains vital but withholding aid has done nothing to promote this. Aid is valuable in its own right for alleviating suffering, as well as a potential means of opening up a closed country, improving governance and empowering people to take control of their own lives.\"</p> <p>The ICG is not calling for an end to sanctions against Burma, imposed since the military government cancelled the elections of 1990 and imprisoned the democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi, but it is arguing for an easing of Burma's international isolation. In doing so, it is advocating a significant rethink by pro-democracy campaigners. <a href=\"http://www.burmacampaign.org.uk/\">The Burma Campaign</a>, for example, calls on people to \"increase economic pressure on the regime by discouraging investment and tourism.\" The Lonely Planet travel guide has been the target of protests because it says people should make up their own minds about whether or not to go there.</p> <p>I do not know whether the time has come to end the tourism boycott \u2013 and, although I am generally sceptical about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/apr/24/boycottnomore\">boycotts</a>, I would be prepared to be guided by those more directly working in the country. However, when I met with a group of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/aug/24/toolongasacrifice\">Burmese democracy activists</a> on the Burma-Thai border a couple of years ago, I sensed that they were considering a change of tactics and that \"positive engagement\" by the international community might give them more space within which to work. </p> <p>However, the ICG report has a wider political significance in that this was the organisation that was responsible for developing the concept of the \"responsibility to protect\", which Kouchner and Miliband cited in justification of their bellicose rhetoric. Even the ICG has now noticed such sweeping declarations of political principle may make good slogans, but they are not proving much practical use in actually helping people on the ground.</p>",
  "<p>Reform of the global financial system. Who could disagree with that, especially in times like these? To call for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/21/globaleconomy-g8\">new Bretton Woods</a> conference, though, is the easy bit. It's a call that makes a politician sound statesmanlike, far-sighted, influential \u2014 even visionary. And it is not necessarily an insincere or selfishly motivated call either. In troubled times most political leaders want to do the right thing. But there is a big problem. How would it actually work?</p> <p>Before looking at Bretton Woods II, take a moment to look at Bretton Woods I. The official title of the 1944 conference was imposing \u2014 the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference. The reality was very different. Although 44 nations \u2014 including China and the Soviet Union\u2014 sent a total of 730 delegates to Bretton Woods, this was not a meeting of equals. Some attendees were governments in exile, like France. Some were not in full command of their own territory, like the Philippines. Others were present as colonial possessions, including India. Still others had no intention of subjecting themselves to anything agreed by the conference, notably the Soviet Union. All of them were at war and many of them were represented by people whose nations were going through a traumatic existential challenge. The \"never again\" mood was immense. It played a key role in getting the allies to agree.</p> <p>In practice <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system\">Bretton Woods I</a> was dominated, just as the mythology says, by two nations \u2014 Britain and the United States \u2014 and, in the end, by just one of the two, the US. The British mythology of Bretton Woods stresses the battle between a declining Britain, represented by John Maynard Keynes, which sought to create a global reserve system, and the triumphant US, represented by Harry Dexter White, which wanted a financial system based on the dollar. Inevitably the Americans won, because they were the strongest nation at the table. Bretton Woods I is often compared to a poker game. In reality though it was simply a power battle in which the most powerful country won and the others \u2014 the USSR and its supporters excepted \u2014 were compelled to accept the settlement, because they got more from being part of the US-led system than they did from refusing to be part of it. </p> <p>These principles need to be born in mind when considering any putative Bretton Woods II. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> said the other day that this was a time that called for the best ideas and the best minds. And it is tempting to imagine the great latterday economists \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/22/economy-economics\">Ha-Joon Chang</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/14/economics-creditcrunch\">Paul Krugman</a>, Amartya Sen, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/josephstiglitz\">Joseph Stiglitz</a> and the rest \u2014 all gathering in the New Hampshire mountains 65 years after Keynes and White to hammer out a new ideal framework of banking and credit reform for the world to follow. It would certainly be a fascinating exercise. But the reality is that the first decision about Bretton Woods II would be an entirely geopolitical one: which countries would get a seat at the table? Would it be a G7 gathering? Or a G8 (the G7 plus Russia)? Or a G20 (the G8 plus China, India, Brazil, the EU and several more). Or would it be, as Bretton Woods I was, the members of the then unofficial \"united nations\" \u2014 just 44 of them in 1944 but now an officially equal 192 (last time I looked) today? Put it another way: how can failed international institutions reform themselves?</p> <p>Merely to ask these questions \u2014 each of which would produce a very different conference and communiqu\u00e9 depending on which answer was chosen\u2014 is to realise that it may be much more difficult for the modern nations to do something in peacetime that the allied nations of the second world war were able to achieve under the pressures of potential oblivion. Not the least of the problems is that the very governments that would meet to debate the new order would themselves largely be the selfsame governments that failed to control the old one. There would, to put it mildly, be conflicting interests around the table. One thing that can also be said with absolute certainty is that Bretton Woods II would neither be dominated by the US and Britain (whatever Gordon Brown may want us to imagine) as Bretton Woods I was, nor end in a lasting settlement that centred the global economy on the United States system. Any new system would either be a tinkering with the old one (useful but nowhere approaching the structural radicalism of Bretton Woods I) or would involve radical economic changes that few of the participants, even China and Russia, seem yet to want, much less to agree on.</p> <p>None of this is to say that some sort of radical restructuring of the global banking system will not happen. But if it does, it will happen not because of economics but because of politics. It will happen because the powers simply cannot afford to allow what has happened in 2008 to happen again. Yet even if this were the case, the solution would not be as straightforward as it may seem. We are said to inhabit a post-Westphalian world in which nation states no longer command the globe as they did even in 1944. If that is the case, how can the powers, however united, determined and resolute, mould a 21st century world economy that marches to their collective drum? Looking at the agenda for any such conference it is not hard to see at least one key paradox \u2014 that Bretton Woods II would essentially mark the end of American economic dominance even while President Barack Obama (if he is elected in two weeks) might be the one political leader who might just have the authority to make some of it happen.</p>",
  "<p>Every day brings news of lifelong <a href=\"http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/gophome\">Republicans endorsing Barack Obama</a>. The most recent was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/19/colin-powell-endorses-barack-obama\">Colin Powell</a>, and before him <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/19/fashion/19buckley.html\">Christopher Buckley</a>, son of the founder of the modern conservative movement, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Buckley_Jr.\">William Buckley</a>. Before that there were former Republican members of congress Jim Leach, Douglas Kmiec, Bruce Bartlett, Lincoln Chafee and Rita Hauser. All of them were senior members of the party who served in various previous presidential administrations or Congress. If these Republicans are willing to publicly renounce their party's candidate you can imagine how many other party leaders are unwilling to do so but privately will desert John McCain to vote for Obama.</p> <p>There has even been this <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/opinion/17brooks.html\">extraordinary encomium</a> from New York Times columnist David Brooks, of all people:</p> <blockquote> <p>It is easy to sketch out a scenario in which [Obama] could be a great president. He would be untroubled by self-destructive demons or indiscipline. With that cool manner, he would see reality unfiltered. He could gather - already has gathered - some of the smartest minds in public policy, and, untroubled by intellectual insecurity, he could give them free rein. Though he is young, it is easy to imagine him at the cabinet table, leading a subtle discussion of some long-term problem.</p> </blockquote> <p>When a leading Republican columnist is able to write so enthusiastically about a liberal Democratic presidential candidate, you know it's not just that the Republican candidate has failed to get his point across, but that the Democrat has stolen some serious Republican thunder.</p> <p>Just looking at the electoral map tells you that Obama is either competitive or winning states where the Democrats have historically struggled to succeed: Missouri, North Carolina, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Virginia, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Dakota. The map at <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/maps/obama_vs_mccain/#data\">Real Clear Politics</a> has Obama already winning or leaning in states that would give him 286 electoral votes - 16 more than necessary to win. Another 97 votes are in toss-up states. If Obama gets half of these votes the election will be an absolute rout.</p> <p>So the question becomes: are Republicans only renouncing their candidate and the last eight disastrous years, or has Obama really connected with moderate Republicans and independents in the same way that Ronald Reagan did with hawkish Democrats during his years in office? In addition, have events merely spiraled out of control for the Republicans and in favour of the Democrats with the economic crisis or is Obama's political platform and strategy genuinely appealing to some Republicans? The answer is, I think, a little of both.</p> <p>When I have written before urging Obama to govern from the centre, readers have objected, saying that it is necessary to eradicate all vestiges of previous harmful Republican policies, and that doing so requires a wholesale housecleaning. I'm not so sure. Certainly, the damage must be undone and there will be enough of a Democratic majority in both Houses to do so. But if Democrats govern as George Bush, Dick Cheney and Tom DeLay did, using scorched-earth policies, then they will only be setting themselves up for the same fall the Republicans took in 2006 and are likely to take again this year.</p> <p>A lasting governing majority for Democrats requires co-opting the Republican moderates and drawing in independents. The key to Bill Clinton's success was in doing precisely this. If we learned any lesson from the 2000 election and its aftermath it is that a \"my way or the highway\" approach to governing doesn't work in the long or even medium run.</p>",
  "<p>The language of the new era of official disapproval and control is worth monitoring. \"Disappointing\" was a word applied to many of us at school, and it still contains that note of sorrowful condescension when deployed by politicians, who use it to describe the unworthiness of their subject as well their own moral and intellectual superiority.</p> <p>It appeared on Tuesday in a letter to the Daily Telegraph from the former home secretary David Blunkett who <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/10/22/nosplit/dt2201.xml\">wrote</a>, complaining about the paper's columnist Mary Riddell, \"\u2026 it was disappointing to read her repeating the economically illiterate, but often quoted suggestion that, by abandoning ID cards, there could be massive savings.\"</p> <p>He went on to argue that the bulk of the expenditure for operating an ID card system will be taken care of by the existing plans for biometric visas and passports. This is far from the truth. The ID card will cost us upwards of \u00a35bn, and as taxpayers and individuals we will all benefit when it is scrapped. </p> <p>To use his word, it was disappointing that David Blunkett did not mention in his letter that up until recently he was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/mar/25/uk.idcards\">paid adviser</a> of the US systems company Entrust, which has pitched for the British ID card. </p> <p>And now for the word \"inappropriate\", which appeared in a statement from a Hackney council spokesperson who was explaining why the council had banned the launch of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hackney-That-Rose-Red-Empire-Confidential/dp/0241142164\">Iain Sinclair's new book</a>, Hackney, That Rose Red Empire: A Confidential Report, in Stoke Newington library. \"A decision was taken that it would be inappropriate to launch this book about Hackney in a council owned facility, as we do not wish it to appear that the council condones or shares opinions expressed within the book.\"</p> <p>Sinclair <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/22/hackney-library-book-ban\">points out</a> that the book has not yet been published and the ban appears to stem from his criticism of the destruction caused by Olympics building projects in east London. It follows that is only appropriate for Hackney council to launch a book when it condones or shares of the views of the author. Thus we have an open and shut case of censorship, a small but important ban on free expression, that has been made palatable by the suggestion \u2013 which comes freighted in the word inappropriate \u2013 that Sinclair's critical study of Hackney somehow breaches the bounds of good taste; that it is unseemly. </p> <p>I phoned the council and spent a good deal of time yesterday trying to persuade two spokespeople, who wanted only to talk \"for background\", that this ban did not turn on a matter of taste, or suitability, but was a shameless act of censorship. In short, Hackney officials were, like so many petty tyrants and thought police, taking refuge in the word \"inappropriate\" when their actions and motives were in fact rather sinister and went counter to all our traditions of free expression and debate.</p> <p>It may be appropriate, when Sinclair's book comes out in February, for those who can spare the time to visit <a href=\"http://www.hackney.gov.uk/cl-stoke-newington-main.htm\">Stoke Newington library</a> and read aloud from this great new study of Hackney.</p>",
  "<p>The publication by the Home Office today of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/23/ukcrime-justice\">quarterly crime figures</a> has once again sparked \"shock horror\" headlines. But they are of an unusually arcane type. It was impossible for newspapers to publish the standard stories of catastrophic increases in crime overall, or most types of crime, because these fell or remained stable, according to both the police recorded statistics and the <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/bcs1.html\">British Crime Survey</a>. So they have homed in on the one apparent exception, the 22% increase in \"most serious violence (MSV) against the person\" recorded by the police.</p> <p>But they can't do so in a straightforward way, because the increase is hedged around with technical warnings by the Home Office. Paradoxically, the murky complications are described as resulting from a \"clarification\" to the rules for counting offences. </p> <p>It is hard not to feel sympathy for the government and Home Office over this, not something I've experienced much since Labour became \"New\" by trying to be more Tory than the Tories some 15 years ago. Trying to make the statistics more transparent and congruent with the putative perspective of victims and the public at large, they expanded what previously counted as MSV. A major category of such violence, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodily_harm\">grievous bodily harm</a> (GBH) was expanded in its scope. Cases where there was clearly an intentional attempt to cause GBH, but by some chance this was not in fact inflicted, are now to be counted in the GBH with intent category.</p> <p>The Home Office gives the example of a pub brawl where someone smashed a bottle and slashed at another person with it, but only succeeded in causing minor injury. This change predictably increases the number of recorded GBH cases, even if there is no change in the actual incidence of violence, and the Home Office can have had no interest whatsoever in making this change apart from the commendable one of making the statistics more valid. No spin doctor could have recommended this medicine! It was bound to make their record look bad. Police estimates indicate that this \"clarification\" of the rules \u2013 counter-intuitive, in that it counts as GBH cases where there was no or little actual bodily harm \u2013 accounts for over two-thirds of the increase in GBH cases in the last year. In short, the rise in recorded GBH on the old way of counting was about 7%: not good news, but much less alarming than the headline 22%. </p> <p>This is a repeat of a pattern that has happened twice under New Labour. In the early heady days of commitment to being tough on the causes of crime through evidence-led policymaking, two general changes were introduced in the crime counting rules, taking effect in 1997 and in 2002, both affecting violent crime in particular. The predicted consequence was a sharp rise in recorded violence, which Michael Howard <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/frontpage/4467569.stm\">tried to capitalise on</a> during the 2005 general election campaign. </p> <p>Sympathy for the government must, however, be muted by recognising that this is largely a trap of its own making. Since 1992 New Labour has bought into the narrative framed by the tabloids of defining crime problems in law and order terms, with tough policing and punishment as the only remedy, playing down the deeper roots of crime in the neo-liberal social and economic policies they took over from the Tories \u2013 a Faustian pact, for which they are now paying dearly.</p>",

  "<p>According to reports today the ECB and Sri Lanka Cricket have agreed to postpone Sri Lanka's controversial tour of England in 2009. Though the news has not yet been confirmed it is also expected that the West Indies will step into the gap to play two Tests against England next May. </p> <p>The recent deal between SLC and the Board of Control for Cricket in India - which saw the BCCI pledge $70m in funding in return for the committed presence of Sri Lankan players in the Indian Premier League - meant that the tour of England was always in jeopardy. Sri Lanka's best players had been given the all-clear by their board to appear in the 2009 IPL instead of the Test tour.</p> <p>The ECB were highly reluctant to host a second-rate Sri Lanka XI. Given that the series has been delayed rather than cancelled the ICC is unlikely to intervene. As long as the Tests do take place at a later date then the requirements of Future Tours Programme will be fulfilled. <br> The West Indies also have players in the IPL, but they have no such deal with the BCCI, and their players are expected to put Test cricket first. The two Tests will follow in quick succession from England's four matches in the Caribbean in February and March.</p> <p>The draw for one of the tournaments SLC has committed its players to appear in, the Twenty20 Champions League, was also announced today. England's representatives, Middlesex, have been drawn in a group with Victoria Bushrangers, Pretoria Titans and the Chennai Super Kings.</p> <p>The competition, played in India over the first week in December, features eight teams, two each from the founding board members - Australia, India and South Africa - as well as Middlesex and Pakistan's Sialkot Stallions. Middlesex meet Victoria in the tournament's opening fixture in Mumbai on December 3. They move on to Chennai to play Pretoria two days later and the Super Kings on their home ground on December 6.</p> <p>Group B for the tournament comprises IPL champions Rajasthan Royals, Sialkot, the Natal Dolphins and the Western Warriors. The top two from each group qualify for the semi-finals, with the finalists meeting in Chennai on December 10.</p>",
  "<p>Even as the international community struggles vainly to halt violence in Darfur, another large-scale convulsion is brewing in neighbouring South Kordofan state, a vast region of arid plains and mountains straddling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sudan\">Sudan</a>'s disputed north-south frontier. If not quickly checked, regional experts say the looming battle for territory, resources and oil, pitting Arab and indigenous African tribes against each other, has potential to fracture the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and reignite the Sudanese civil war.</p> <p>South Kordofan includes the oil-rich region of Abyei, scene of renewed north-south violence since 2007, and the Nuba mountains, where memories of the Khartoum government's 1992-3 jihad of mass killing and ethnic cleansing against the Nuba people remain strong. \"Many of the same ingredients exist in South Kordofan that produced Darfur,\" a <a href=\"http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=5738&amp;l=1\">new report by the International Crisis Group</a> says. \"Concrete progress on integration and reform is essential to address the prospect of what could be a devastating new conflict.\"</p> <p>The failure of the two principal signatories to the CPA \u2013 Sudan's ruling National Congress party (NCP) and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) \u2013 to jointly create an efficient, inclusive state government, develop resources (especially adequate water supply), and implement wealth-sharing agreements are blamed for rising tension. Instead the two sides are using proxy forces to assert control in disputed areas ahead of national elections. Meanwhile, the report says hundreds have died this year in clashes over land and grazing rights.</p> <p>The situation in the Nuba mountains is said to be particularly acute. Local people who supported the SPLM in its secessionist war against Khartoum and want greater independence for their own region believe their erstwhile allies have betrayed their cause. According to a study by the <a href=\"http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/\">Small Arms Survey</a>, the formal withdrawal of Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) forces from South Kordofan in January left many communities feeling that they had been delivered into the hands of their enemies.</p> <p>Friction between Arab tribes, mainly Misseriya and Hawazma, and the Nuba and other African groups has since been building. \"It [the withdrawal] increased feelings of insecurity and neglect, and deepened concern that government hardliners in Khartoum are mobilising ethnic militias to manipulate the elections scheduled for 2009,\" the study said.</p> <p>The study highlighted several destabilising developments: \"The Nuba mountains area is highly militarised with both parties [the NCP and the SPLM] recruiting members of armed groups. Khartoum's paramilitary Popular Defence Forces (PDF) is being reorganised on a sharper ethnic basis than in the past. Arabs returning to animal migration routes closed by the war are being armed, with a corresponding mobilisation by some settled tribes.\" Yet despite these trends, the study claimed the <a href=\"http://www.unmis.org/english/en-main.htm\">UN mission in Sudan</a> (Unmis) \"has done little to calm tensions\".</p> <p>According to Hafiz Mohammed of Justice Africa, a new rebellion against Khartoum is already under way in the Nuba mountains, driven by economic grievances and anger that while southern Sudan is due to hold an independence referendum in 2011, no such option is available to the Nuba region. Indeed, if recent north-south boundary proposals are accepted, the Nuba Mountains and Abyei could be cut in two.</p> <p>In testimony to the US Congress, Khataza Gondwe of Christian Solidarity Worldwide said recent events in Abyei \"may yet pale into insignificance in comparison to what will undoubtedly transpire in the Nuba Mountains if urgent intervention does not occur\". Gondwe said Khartoum was encouraging Arab tribes to relocate to the area and was arming and transporting in PDF paramilitaries, Arab supremacist militias and police from Darfur.</p> <p>The kidnapping last week of nine Chinese nationals working in the South Kordofan oilfields has highlighted another key element in this fast-developing saga: the vital importance to both north and south of control of the state's oil resources \u2013 and the exclusion of local people from a share of the resulting wealth. The kidnappers are said to want nothing more than jobs and an end to discriminatory employment practices. </p> <p>British officials monitoring Sudan say they worry that while the surge in fighting in Abyei in May drew international attention \u2013 Britain has donated \u00a35m to support humanitarian efforts there \u2013 the Nuba region has been overlooked. \"We have been concerned for a while about the potential for conflict to take deep root,\" an official said. \"Many Nuba fought with the SPLA but when the CPA was signed, they felt they had been sold down the river.\"</p> <p>Despite these many warnings, the prospect of effective pre-emptive intervention in South Kordofan looks remote. The UN admitted this week that its Darfur mission is still at less than half-strength, attacks on aid workers are rising, and more than 2 million people remain displaced. Sudan's government is meanwhile bitterly resisting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/14/sudan.warcrimes\">efforts to indict President Omar al-Bashir</a> for genocide and war crimes. In this unhappy context, Kordofan may become just another disaster among many.</p>",
  "<p>The teenager bullied into hiding the gun used to kill schoolboy Rhys Jones was unaware that the weapon had been used to commit murder, Liverpool crown court heard today.</p> <p>A youth who cannot be identified was giving evidence in the trial of Sean Mercer, 18, who is accused of shooting 11-year-old Rhys. </p> <p>The jury watched a second day of police interview recordings with the 17-year-old witness, who has been given immunity from prosecution in exchange for his evidence.</p> <p>The witness said he was given the Smith and Wesson .455 revolver by Mercer 20 minutes after Rhys was shot dead in a pub car park on his way home from football practice in August last year. </p> <p>The gun, which was wrapped up in a red and white carrier bag, was then concealed under blankets in the dog kennel at his Croxteth home. </p> <p>But it was only later that night, during conversations in an MSN internet chat room, that he heard about the rival gang shootings at the Fir Tree pub, and realised he might be concealing the murder weapon. </p> <p>\"I started putting things together,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I was thinking that he's give me [the gun] and I wondered if he had fired at them [because they are] from [Norris Green] and he has missed or something.\" </p> <p>Asked why Mercer had chosen him to hide the weapon the witness answered: \"I thought they used me as a safe house or something because I've never been in trouble with the police and I don't go out. I think they thought, 'We'll use him and the police won't have a clue where it is.'\" </p> <p>The witness said he was too frightened to refuse Mercer's demands. \"I was just scared to say no because you think to yourself, 'Well, he might have done that to a little kid so what could he do to me?' He's not going to think twice, like.\" </p> <p>Five days after the killing, one of Mercer's co-accused, Boy K, who is charged with assisting an offender, came to his house and hid the murder weapon in the loft.</p> <p>The next time the witness heard from Mercer was around a month later, after his home had been raided by police, when the murder weapon was recovered. </p> <p>At the time he was abroad and he said Mercer rang his mobile phone and said: \"Your door's been kicked in\". </p> <p>The witness said Mercer continued to phone him but he was too frightened to take his calls.</p> <p>Mercer got through to the witness on Christmas Day and the two had a conversation, which the witness described as surprisingly friendly.</p> <p>\"I thought he was going to be saying things like, 'where do you live now?' and, 'you best not grass on me'. But he wasn't. I don't know whether he was trying to talk nice in case the police could hear the conversation,\" he said.</p> <p>Mercer went on to inquire about the his mother's health and then told the witness \"not to keep looking over [his] shoulder.\" </p> <p>He also tried to reassure the witness, saying: \"Don't think they are following you because they're not.\" </p> <p>Asked why he thought Mercer had been friendly, the witness said: \"I don't know really, I thought he was trying to play the innocent one.\" </p> <p>Sean Mercer denies murder. His six co-accused, James Yates, 20, Nathan Quinn, 18, Gary Kays, 25, Melvin Coy, 24, Boy M, 16, and Boy K, 17, deny assisting an offender.</p>",
  "<p><em>The following is the text of the letter sent today to <a href=\"http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/about-us/corporate-structure-and-management/the-commissioners/sam-younger\">Sam Younger of the Electoral Commission</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/23/george-osborne-oleg-deripaska\">seeking clarification</a> of the commission's interpretation of the law on whether a possible donation from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oleg-deripaska\">Oleg Deripaska</a> to the Conservative party would have broken regulations and whether discussions about such a donation involving the shadow chancellor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne\">George Osborne</a>, may have been illegal.<br></em><br>Dear Mr Younger, </p> <p>I understand that the Electoral Commission has said that no offence had been committed under electoral law in the case of Mr George Osborne MP or Mr Andrew Feldman, the chief executive of the Conservative party, during their time on Corfu in August. I would be grateful therefore for a reasoned explanation of your views on the law, as my reading of it suggests a possible offence under section 61 (1) of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. </p> <p>Under this section \"a person commits an offence if he knowingly does any act in furtherance of any arrangement which facilitates or is likely to facilitate, whether by means of any concealment or disguise or otherwise, the making of donations to a registered party by any person or body other than a permissible donor.\" It seems clear from the act that an offence does not require a donation, but merely \"any arrangement \u2026 likely to facilitate\" donations from an impermissible donor (in this case, Mr Oleg Deripaska, a Russian citizen). Mr Osborne's and Mr Feldman's actions seem to fall into the category of preparing such an arrangement.</p> <p>The evidence that such an offence may have occurred comes from Mr Nat Rothschild, said to be corroborated by Mr James Goodwin. Mr Rothschild, in a statement this week, said: \"Not once in the acres of coverage did you mention that George Osborne, who also accepted my hospitality, found the opportunity of meeting with Mr Deripaska so good that he invited the Conservatives' fundraiser Andrew Feldman, who was staying nearby, to accompany him on to Mr Deripaska's boat to solicit a donation. Since Mr Deripaska is not a British citizen, it was suggested by Mr Feldman, in a subsequent conversation at which Mr Deripaska was not present, that the donation was \"channelled\" through one of Mr Deripaska's British companies.\"</p> <p>I would also be grateful if you would confirm that a donation by a foreign citizen not resident and on the electoral register in the UK \"channelled\" through a conduit such as a UK trading company would be illegal. If so, there is a prima facie case for considering whether Mr Osborne and Mr Feldman have done \"any act in furtherance of any arrangement which facilitates or is likely to facilitate, whether by means of concealment or disguise or otherwise, the making of donations \u2026 by other than a permissible donor\".</p> <p>Given that this offence is punishable by up to a one-year custodial sentence, I am sure you will agree with me on the need to establish quickly whether the law has been broken and clarify your position if you believe that there is no case to answer. You should either open an inquiry into the events on Mr Deripaska's yacht or you should set out clearly your interpretation of the law.</p> <p>You will also be aware that the Conservative party has yet to disclose the full sources of its funding at the last general election, which may have been loans made by people who would now be impermissible donors. There is the strongest possible public interest in full openness about the sources of party political funds, which is why I believe it is so important that this matter is clarified or fully investigated by you. I look forward to your early response.</p> <p>Yours sincerely, <br>Chris Huhne MP <br>(Liberal Democrat Shadow Home Secretary) </p> <p><em>For legal reasons, we regret this thread is not open for comments.<br></em></p>",
  "<p>It is fitting that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/brettonwoods\">a new Bretton Woods</a> is being discussed now. The original Bretton Woods institutions were created after the second world war in recognition of the fact that even developed countries can experience liquidity crises and that global efforts are required for economic development. In the throes of the current, formidable economic crisis, it is appropriate to consider the ways in which the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/3187467/Financial-crisis-is-man-made-catastrophe-says-World-Bank-chief.html\">international economic system can be reformed</a> to govern globalised financial markets and inter-linked economies. <br><br>Although there have been calls for some time for the current international financial institutions (IFIs) to be more representative of emerging economies, it took this financial crisis to underscore the extent to which the global economic structure has changed. Namely, the global imbalances which permitted the west to access cheap credit despite its low saving rates, particularly the US and the UK. The worst banking crisis since the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression\">Great Depression</a> strongly suggests that a global rules-based system is necessary to oversee financial markets and coordinate economic management. The issues are rather different from those of the Bretton Woods era, and would require further development of international economic institutions and laws to govern an increasingly multi-polar world economy.</p> <p>A new Bretton Woods has to be accommodative of the shifting global economic weight toward emerging economies, but also able to act quickly to stabilise financial markets. This would require promulgating international economic law and regulations as well as reforming the current international financial institutions, such as the <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/index.htm\">IMF</a>. </p> <p>The financial crisis has revealed the extent of the inter-linkages among markets, making it apparent that cross-border dealings require regulation. For instance, there should be an international clearing house for financial transactions and also a body to monitor cross-border capital flows. The latter of which could be under the auspices of an institution like the <a href=\"http://www.bis.org/\">Bank for International Settlements</a> (or BIS, which is the central banks' bank) with power to demand greater transparency in financial dealings in all major markets. </p> <p>This need not be more burdensome than what national regulations already require, though clearly reform is needed there as well. The resultant multi-level system of governance could be modelled after federal regulatory systems such as in the US. However, regulation cannot be the entire answer, as active engagement by regulators will always be needed since written rules are unlikely to keep up with innovative markets. In a new Bretton Woods system, there should be regulators operating under the auspices of an international regulatory framework to monitor world markets. </p> <p>Second, banks are indeed global or at least regional, as in Europe, so there should be a coordinated and efficient deposit insurance scheme up to a widely accepted limit so that confidence is assured and bank runs are not a possibility even if there are bank failures, as is the system in the US. </p> <p>Third, the existing international institutions continue to have important roles, but need reform, including expanding their memberships to reflect the shift of global economic power to the east. Even before this crisis, there was much talk about increasing transparency and accountability in the IMF in particular. As a provider of liquidity when countries are in trouble, it is telling that <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5itQzswxi7QzOQgTSZpEYHznhE3wAD93LL6DG0\">Iceland</a> and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/3222412/China-to-bail-out-near-bankrupt-Pakistan.html\">Pakistan</a> were reluctant to seek their assistance and turned instead to the emerging powers of Russia and China, respectively. </p> <p>Similar reforms to strengthen the mandate of the World Bank would also be warranted. Fourth, a likely response to looming national recession is an increase in protectionist sentiment, evidenced in the <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/id/17606.htm\">Smoot-Hawley Act</a> passed in the US in the great depression which had the effect of slowing global trade and worsening the economic downturn. Any new Bretton Woods system should encompass reforms to the <a href=\"http://www.wto.org/\">World Trade Organisation</a> (WTO). The WTO helps to establish a rules-based system for trade and should work to ensure that trade is not disrupted by protectionist tendencies that can arise in times of crisis. Its operation in the past decade suggests that it is a fairly efficient forum for resolving disputes, though the <a href=\"http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news08_e/agric_15oct08_e.htm\">Doha round</a> extending its coverage to more traded goods and services has stalled. Enhancing the WTO should be part of any new system so that rules rather than power (and politics) are the premise of international trade; in other words, the development of international economic law. </p> <p>Finally, an international body or forum cannot force its mandate on sovereign nations, but must appeal to the mutual self-interest of countries in maintaining stability by, for instance, monitoring the development of the so-called global imbalances which led to excess liquidity and mis-priced risk. The onus cannot entirely be on one country, as macroeconomic forces are intertwined, eg if the US didn't consume so much, then China would not be such a significant lender. </p> <p>A new set of Bretton Woods institutions that identified these economic flows and assessed their consequences would help policymakers coordinate responses to try and lean against future asset bubbles. Indeed, the next one could be in emerging economies as cheap currencies and trapped domestic savings fuel housing bubbles even as interest rate cuts to stimulate the west promote global liquidity searching for the next investment opportunity, which will be in Asia in the next couple of years. It is therefore in the interest of all countries to have a system of international economic law and associated institutions, and a new Bretton Woods would be a positive legacy of this financial crisis.</p>",
  "<p>The House of Lords today drew stark attention to the conflict between sharia and UK law, calling the Islamic legal code \"wholly incompatible\" with human rights legislation.</p> <p>The remarks came as the Lords considered the case of a woman who, if she was sent back to Lebanon, would be obliged under sharia law to hand over custody of her 12-year-old son to a man who beat her, threw her off a balcony and, on one occasion, attempted to strangle her. </p> <p>The woman was seeking asylum in the UK to avoid the provisions of sharia law that give fathers or other male family members the exclusive custody of children over seven. </p> <p>In the most high-profile UK criticism of the family law provisions of sharia law so far, the Lords stated that these provisions breached the mother's rights to family life and the right against discrimination and were severely disruptive to the child. </p> <p>The comments followed months of debate over the appropriateness of incorporating sharia courts into the UK's legal system.</p> <p>Such a move has been advocated by figures including the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, and Lord Phillips, the new senior law lord.</p> <p>The minister for community cohesion, Sadiq Khan, a Muslim, said recently that sharia courts risked entrenching unequal bargaining power between the sexes. </p> <p>Sharia courts have been delivering judgments in the UK since last year, and currently operate in London, Birmingham, Bradford, Coventry and Manchester, with plans to expand into Scotland.</p> <p>Formally classified as arbitration tribunals, their decisions are legally binding and can be enforced by county courts and high courts provided that both sides in a case agree to have the matter decided under the sharia system.<br> One of the most controversial areas in which the network of sharia courts is already operating is family law, including divorce and domestic violence.</p> <p>Ruling that the woman should not be returned to Lebanon, Lord Hope said \"the mutual enjoyment by parent and child of each other's company is a fundamental element of family life\".</p> <p>\"The fact is, however, that sharia law as it is applied in Lebanon was created by and for men in a male-dominated society,\" he added. </p> <p>\"The place of the mother in the life of a child under that system is quite different under that law from that which is guaranteed [by the European convention on human rights] ... it is discriminatory, too, because it denies women custody of their children after they have reached the age of custodial transfer simply because they are women.\"</p> <p>Lord Bingham, a former senior law lord, added that, as a result of the provisions, \"women are often constrained to remain in abusive marriages for fear of losing their children\". </p> <p>He criticised the provisions of sharia law for automatically giving custody to \"a father who has inflicted physical violence and psychological injury on the mother\".</p> <p>Although the court, which ruled 5-1 that the woman and her son should be allowed to remain in the UK, said the case was \"exceptional\", it is anticipated that the decision will set a precedent for future cases. </p> <p>The human rights group Liberty, which intervened in the case, said the ruling \"upheld basic protections which must be available to us all\".</p>",
  "<p>The Electoral Commission was today urged to consider launching a full investigation into allegations that George Osborne solicited a donation to the Conservative party from the Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska.</p> <p>Chris Huhne, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, sent a letter to the commission saying that it was important to establish whether the law had been broken.</p> <p>Huhne's intervention came after another Lib Dem MP, Norman Baker, said he would be asking parliament's standards watchdog to rule on whether Osborne should have declared his stay at Nathaniel Rothschild's Corfu villa in the Commons register of members' interests.</p> <p>During the stay Osborne, Rothschild and the Conservative party chief executive, Andrew Feldman, had a conversation about a possible donation from Deripaska. As a foreigner, Deripaska is not allowed to donate to a British political party, although he owns a company based in the UK that would be allowed to make a donation.</p> <p>The talks came to nothing and no money was ever paid to the Conservative party. </p> <p>But this week Osborne has been embroiled in a row with Rothschild, who claims that the two Tories actively solicited a donation and that they contemplated \"channeling\" it through one of Deripaska's British companies. The Tories strongly deny these two aspects of Rothschild's account.</p> <p>After Rothschild made his allegations, in a letter to The Times published on Tuesday, the Electoral Commission said it had not seen any evidence to suggest that the law had been broken. Although accepting a foreign donation is illegal, soliciting one \u2013 which the Tories deny \u2013 is not.</p> <p>But today, in his letter, Huhne said that section 61 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (PPERA) said it was an offence to commit an act \"in furtherance of any arrangement which facilitates or is likely to facilitate, whether by means of any concealment or disguise or otherwise\", the payment of an illegal donation.</p> <p>Huhne said that Rothschild's account suggested that an offence might have been committed.</p> <p>In his letter to the commission's chairman, Sam Younger, Huhne said: \"Given that this offence is punishable by up to a one-year custodial sentence, I am sure you will agree with me on the need to establish quickly whether the law has been broken and clarify your position if you believe that there is no case to answer.\"</p> <p>The commission should either clarify the law, or launch a full investigation, he said.</p> <p>The commission has already considered the section 61 point, which has also been raised publicly by the Labour MP Denis MacShane. It believes that, because no donation was made, section 61 does not apply.</p> <p>A commission spokesman said this afternoon: \"We have received the letter and we will reply in due course. But what we said yesterday, which is that we have seen no evidence of a breach of PPERA, is still our position.\"</p> <p>In a separate move, Baker, a Liberal Democrat MP, said that he would be writing to the parliamentary commissioner for standards to seek clarification because there were strong grounds for believing that the shadow chancellor should have declared the visit to Rothschild's villa in the Commons register of members' interests.</p> <p>Osborne and his family spent a weekend at the villa this summer. </p> <p>Under Commons rules, MPs have to make a declaration if they receive hospitality worth more than 1% of their salary \u2013 around \u00a3610 \u2013 \"which in any way relates to membership of the house\".</p> <p>Osborne was at school with Rothschild and they have been friends for years. According to a Tory source, he did not declare the visit in the register because he believed it was a social visit that had nothing to do with his work as an MP.</p> <p>But Baker said that he felt Osborne should have registered the visit because, as shadow chancellor, he was in a different position from an ordinary backbench MP. He said that the guidance issued to MPs specifically says that decisions to register hospitality are \"a matter of judgment\" and that \"if there is any doubt\" an MP should register.</p> <p>\"I think it's very important you establish the rules, not just for Mr Osborne's case, but also Peter Mandelson and any other MPs who may have been involved in accepting hospitality from a third party,\" Baker told the BBC's World at One.</p> <p>\"Clarity and openness is always the safeguard for individual Members of parliament and I recommend Mr Osborne should register this stay.\"</p> <p>Later Baker said that his letter to the parliamentary commissioner for standards, John Lyon, which he would be writing this afternoon, would not be a formal complaint. Instead it would be a request for clarification.</p> <p>Baker said that he would mention Osborne and Mandelson, who has also enjoyed Rothschild's hospitality. As a peer, Mandelson has to follow House of Lords rules, not the Commons ones enforced by the parliamentary commissioner. But Baker said it would be helpful if Lyon could provide clearer guidelines for ministers as well as for MPs.</p> <p>Baker's intervention came as David Cameron said that the Conservatives would cooperate with any inquiry into the Osborne-Deripaska affair.</p> <p>\"We will obviously cooperate with any investigation that takes place but it's not at all clear what the prime minister was talking about [when he called for an investigation in the Commons yesterday],\" Cameron said.</p> <p>Cameron said that Gordon Brown's own spokesman was unable to say who should carry out an inquiry, or what they should investigate.</p> <p>In a further reference to Brown's comments in the Commons, Cameron said: \"I don't know whether he misspoke or whether he was keeping it going to play politics with it.\"</p>",
  "<p>Children's services directors were today urged to pump money into early intervention projects in schools to ensure all children and young people reach their potential.</p> <p>The children's secretary, Ed Balls, told directors of children's services: \"The future of young children is in all of your hands.\"</p> <p>Speaking at the children's and adults social care conference in Liverpool today, he said: \"On early intervention and prevention, it is so important that we intervene before problems are very difficult to deal with.</p> <p>\"We can only do it if there is a much more integrated service between schools and children's services.\"</p> <p>Since children are only in school for 14% of the time, Balls stressed the importance of supporting stability at home and said there was no \"trade-off\" between schools standards and the wellbeing agenda. </p> <p>If children turn up at school not having had breakfast or not having been home the night before it impairs teachers' ability to teach, he said. </p> <p>\"We've been driving the wellbeing agenda because it is essential if every child's potential is to be reached,\" said Balls.</p> <p>Directors of children's services had a vital role to play in multi-agency dhildren's trusts as a catalyst for driving change and \"removing any barriers\" that prevented children and young people from reaching their potential, he said. </p> <p>Balls was speaking following the introduction today of 12 pilot schemes to replace failing pupil referral units (PRUs) with those run by private companies and charities.</p> <p>\"The reform of alternative provision not only does better by children but brings in the expertise of providers to intervene earlier,\" said Balls. \"The private and voluntary sector and local authorities are trying new ways of doing it.\"</p> <p>The Prince's Trust, Barnardo's, Nacro, Rathbone and Kids Company are among the charities which will run the controversial \u00a326.5m schemes. They include a cadet training centre, a city farm, a work-based learning centre and a therapeutic learning project.</p> <p>Unoco group is one of the private sector providers. In Herefordshire, Hereford Academy is working with the county council to run new-style PRUs.</p> <p>Balls told delegates he would welcome bids from single providers to deliver more projects for children at risk of exclusion and crime to improve their educational attainment and prevent them from entering the criminal justice system or from reoffending. But he promised he would also strengthen councils' powers to step in if a charity or private firm poorly performed.</p> <p>\"There is little power for local authorities to intervene when alternative provision is under performing.

  "<p>I'm an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books\">author</a> (and television producer) with a passion for secret signs \u2013 all the ways that people in the know privately communicate with each other. I love books where something hinges on a sign or a symbol that the protagonist has to decipher. Authors are playful people, too, so I'm always on the lookout for any hidden messages they might have included, in a character's name, for example, or even on the cover. Here are some of my favourites.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780340976487\">Buy Justin's book on secret signs at the Guardian bookshop</a></p> <h2>1. Luke 22: The Last Supper</h2> <p>When disciples Peter and John ask Jesus where their Passover meal will be held, Jesus gives them a secret sign. They are to go into Jerusalem and look for a man carrying a jar of water - a very unusual sight at a time when only women collected water from the well. Follow the man, says Jesus, and when he enters a house, say to the owner: \"The Teacher asks you, Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?\" It was during this Last Supper with his disciples that Judas kissed Jesus as a secret sign, to betray him into the hands of the authorities.</p> <h2>2. The Da Vinci Code</h2> <p>Dan Brown's story begins with a corpse laid out in the Louvre in the pose of Da Vinci's Vetruvian Man, and a pentacle sketched on his stomach in blood. Among the many other hidden signs in the book are anagrams, the letters PS, the Fibonacci sequence, and the letter V formed by Jesus and the figure to his right in da Vinci's Last Supper. The original book jacket was itself full of secret signs, including reverse writing, and latitude and longitude coordinates.</p> <h2>3. The Gladstone Diaries</h2> <p>Despite becoming Prime Minister four times between 1868 and 1894, WE Gladstone was tortured by the conflict between his devout religious feelings and his passion for pornography. To purge himself, he whipped and scourged his body in private, and recorded each beating in the diaries he kept for seventy years, using his own secret symbol: a little whip. The less inhibited scientist Robert Hooke noted his sexual encounters in his diary with a Pisces symbol, while Hans Christian Andersen privately recorded incidents of self-abuse with \"++\".</p> <h2>4. Lewis Carroll's Alice stories</h2> <p>Like Dan Brown, Carroll aka Charles Dodgson was an inveterate puzzler, and his books are full of tricks, anagrams and wordplay. In Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865), the Dodo, for example, was a caricature of Carroll, who had a stutter and tended to introduce himself as Do-Do-Dodgson. In Through the Looking Glass (1871) , the poem A Boat Beneath a Sunny Sky hides an acrostic message: the first letter of each line spells A-L-I-C-E P-L-E-A-S-A-N-C-E L-I-D-D-E-L-L. Disraeli is hidden in Tenniel's illustrations, sitting on a train in a paper hat. </p> <h2>5. Joshua 2: Rahab and the Scarlet Cord</h2> <p>Joshua sends spies into the city of Jericho to check out its military strength. They are lodging at the house of a prostitute, Rahab, when the king's soldiers arrive looking for them. Rahab hides the spies under bundles of flax on her roof, then smuggles them out of the window using a scarlet cord. The spies promise to spare Rahab and her family in the coming attack. The scarlet cord will be the secret sign: if Rahab hangs it in her window, everyone in her house will be spared. According to one theory, the red light of a brothel originated with Rahab's signal. </p> <h2>6. The Name of the Rose</h2> <p>William of Baskerville arrives at a Benedictine abbey in medieval Italy to lay the groundwork for a theological meeting. Instead, there is a gruesome murder, and Baskerville (a pun on Sherlock Holmes), investigates. The plot revolves (and revolves!) around a secret book by Aristotle, hidden in a labyrinthine library. To penetrate the library and its secrets, Baskerville must decode manuscripts, solve riddles and much much more. Umberto Eco's 1980 classic is full of secret signs, from the abbey door to the abbot's ring \u2013 not surprising as Eco is a professor of semiotics, the study of signs and symbols as a form of language.</p> <h2>7. Harry Potter &amp; The Philosopher's Stone</h2> <p>At the start of the first book in the series, dark wizard Lord Voldemort kills Lily and James Potter, and then turns his attention to their one-year-old child, Harry. But thanks to Lily's self-sacrifice, the attack fails, leaving Voldemort's body destroyed and Harry with a lightning bolt scar on his forehead. The scar is both an indelible mark of Harry's past and a sign of how that past will catch up with him. </p> <h2>8. Sherlock Holmes &amp; The Adventure of the Dancing Men (1903)</h2> <p>Holmes comes to the aid of Elsie Cubitt, a young American haunted by messages made up of stick figures. Holmes realises it is a substitution code and uses frequency analysis to crack it. E is the most commonly used letter in English, and the word Elsie is likely to be in the messages. Holmes identifies the \"dancing men\" that represent E, L S and I, breaks the code and then composes his own message to catch the bad guy. Holmes inspired the character Dr Gregory House. As well as the homes/house pun, they both live at 221B, use observation and deduction to solve puzzles, and share an addiction to drugs. And while Holmes's sidekick is Dr John Watson, House's is Dr James Wilson.</p> <h2>9. The Scarlet Pimpernel</h2> <p>In Baroness Orczy's play and novels, The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel is a secret society of English aristocrats, dedicated to rescuing French nobility from the guillotines of the French Revolution. The League is led by the mysterious Scarlet Pimpernel (aka arch-fop Sir Percy Blakeney) who signs his messages with a drawing of the little flower. The plant is itself a secret sign of bad weather, as its petals close up when atmospheric pressure drops.</p> <h2>10. The Secret Seven</h2> <p>The Secret Seven are a gang of children and their spaniel Scamper who investigate mysteries from their secret HQ in the garden shed. Though the stories first appeared only a few years after WW2, Enid Blyton often abbreviated the gang's name to the SS. The letters were painted on the shed door. In Secret Seven on the Trail (1952), we read that at school, the gang \"wore their little badges with 'SS' embroidered on the button. It was fun to see the other children looking enviously at them wishing they could have one too.\" Right.</p>",
  "<p>Public confidence in the national crime statistics has never been high. Opinion polls repeatedly tell us that the public think crime has been rising remorselessly despite the fact that on the best measure that we have available - the British Crime Survey - it has fallen by more than a third since 1995. </p> <p>Indeed when Charles Clarke was home secretary he thought this lack of public trust had got so bad that it was no longer possible to have a grown-up debate about alternative criminal justice policies.</p> <p>The fiasco over the Home Office publication of the latest quarterly crime figures does nothing to repair that damage. On the face of it there were a good set of figures to report. Overall on both the BCS and police recorded crime figures the headline crime rate is down by 6% in the 12 months to June 2008 dispelling fears that the economic downturn had already sent the crime rate soaring.</p> <p>Even on violence the overall picture is encouraging. Murder is down by 10%, gun crime by 6% and the 237,000 offences categorised as violence against the person recorded by the police between April and June this year is down 7% on the year before.</p> <p>Yet this reassuring picture was punctured by the disclosure that the number of offences recorded and categorised by the police as the \"most serious violence against the person\" between April and June this year rose by 22% from 4,038 to 5,073. </p> <p>The Home Office, unusually for the quarterly crime figures, held a journalists' briefing to explain this apparently alarming figure in this violent crime sub-category. So is this a statistical quirk or does it represent a real surge in the most violent crimes in England and Wales and a consistent under recording of most serious violent crime by the police?</p> <p>Professor Paul Wiles, the Home Office's director of research and statistics, explained that the extent of the problem only became clear after an agreed clarification of the counting rules was issued to police forces in April. This said that cases where there was clear evidence of intent to commit grievous bodily harm should be classified as a \"most serious violent offence\" regardless of whether the victim had actually been injured or not.</p> <p>Wiles cited the example of a nightclub fight in which a woman smashes a bottle on a nightclub table and then lunges at her victim but only succeeds in cutting her nose and giving her a nosebleed. It now transpires that many, if not all 43 police forces, in England and Wales had been recorded such incidents in the alternative, and less serious category, of \"other violence against the person with and without injury.\"</p> <p>After the clarification was issued 13 police forces reported that the number of GBH with intent cases they were reporting had almost doubled. The Home Office asked them to do a recount and they estimated that two-thirds of the 22% rise in this category of violent crime was down to the change in interpretation of the counting rules. Only 5% of the rise represented an actual increase in more serious violent offences - about 200 actual assaults out of a total of 237,000 violent crimes. This view was endorsed by the Association of Chief Police Officers.</p> <p>The net result of this recategorisation is a full-scale row about what appears at first sight to be a headline surge in serious violent crime and so undermining, once again, any more balanced picture of the falling crime rate in England and Wales.</p>",
  "<p>The government today faced renewed calls for a joint public inquiry into the fatal Potters Bar and Grayrigg rail crashes after an <a href=\"http://www.raib.gov.uk/cms_resources/23102008_R202008_Grayrigg.pdf\">official report (pdf)</a> criticised the safety regime at Network Rail.</p> <p>The demand for a combined investigation followed the publication of a detailed study into the derailment of a Virgin train on the west coast main line last year, which killed one person and injured 86. </p> <p>The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said a \"number of shortcomings\" in Network Rail's safety management helped cause the accident on the evening of February 23 near Grayrigg, Cumbria.</p> <p>A faulty set of points, which switch trains from one side of a railtrack to another, was allowed to deteriorate and should have been spotted by a track inspection five days before the incident - but local management failed to carry out a scheduled check. The RAIB said an \"incomplete\" understanding of the type of point that caused the Grayrigg crash also contributed to the crash, in which an 84-year-old passenger, Margaret Masson, died.</p> <p>The report has prompted calls from unions and representatives of rail crash victims for a joint public inquiry into Grayrigg and Potters Bar, where seven passengers were killed on May 10 2002 after a poorly maintained set of points derailed a train as it approached Potters Bar station at high speed.</p> <p>\"A public inquiry will take an independent look at what needs to be done. The problems with the maintenance regime are fundamental and systemic. This could happen again,\" said Louise Christian, a solictor representing victims of the Grayrigg and Potters Bar crashes.</p> <p>The RMT union also called for a joint investigation that should include a study of the rail industry's structure, which Network Rail dominates as the owner of the system with sole responsibility for maintenance and engineering work.</p> <p>The transport secretary, Geoff Hoon, today left open the option of a joint public inquiry into Grayrigg and Potters Bar. The inquest into the Potters Bar crash was suspended last year pending the outcome of the investigations into the Grayrigg crash. Hoon said today that he would consult victims and bereaved families from both crashes before making a final decision in the new year.</p> <p>\"I consider it essential to ensure that the way forward is one that will deliver closure to those who were affected, as soon as possible,\" he said. </p> <p>Hoon added that Network Rail had already taken enough steps to prevent a repeat of Grayrigg, following two reports last year including an internal study by Network Rail in which the company was heavily critical of its role in the accident. Following Potters Bar, Network Rail took all maintenance work in house.</p> <p>The Office of Rail Regulation (ORR), which has the power to bring criminal prosecutions over rail safety breaches, said it would consider the report \"carefully\". The RAIB's 29 recommendations included a review of how Network Rail inspects the thousands of points used across the rail system.</p> <p>So far the ORR has ordered Network Rail to make two changes to its maintenance and safety regimes since the Grayrigg crash. The first, which demanded better organisation of track inspections, has been carried out, but the second, that Network Rail should change the design of certain points, is being challenged by Network Rail.</p> <p>The RAIB today condoned the ORR's concerns over so-called groundframe points and ordered Network Rail to modify their design. It added that similar recommendations following Potters Bar were not implemented and could have prevented the Grayrigg crash from happening. </p> <p>The RAIB has also ordered the Rail Safety and Standards Board to review its study into whether safety belts should be installed in trains. The RSSB has concluded that they will make a minimal difference and are too expensive but the RAIB say the circumstances of Grayrigg warrants a re-examination of its conclusions.</p> <p>Iain Coucher, the Network Rail chief executive, said the company was \"devastated\" by its failings over Grayrigg. \"Travel by rail is the safest form of travel and despite Grayrigg, the railways are safer than ever before. It is important that the rail industry seeks ways to make it safer still and this report should help that process,\" he said. </p> <p>A Network Rail employee is still on bail after he was arrested as part of a British Transport police investigation into the crash.</p>",

  "<p>Explaining International Rules football to the uninitiated is a task so knotty and problematical that it would send King Solomon himself off in search of a new job. It's a fast, entertaining, rough 'n' tumble sport, for sure, but it's also difficult to pin down.<br> International Rules is a comparative nightmare, you see, a series of links and similes that eventually metastasise into a referential miasma. And if all that's not enough to give you a migraine, the head-wrecking jersey designs certainly will. The hybrid brings together two games which themselves aren't easily defined if you haven't seen them played. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StcMJkQ80ns\">Gaelic football</a> could very loosely be described as a cross between rugby, soccer and that daft handball thing they play in the Olympics; <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiGoqObb0YQ\">Australian Rules</a> football is like a mixture of Gaelic football, all-in wrestling and, considering the number of blokes involved with matted dirty blond hair involved, the May Day riots.</p> <p>International Rules, thus, is a mixture of the two, which is a mixture of mixtures, which is way too confusing for anyone of normal intelligence. Apparently, only four people fully understand the rules and structures of IR, and three of those are lying.</p> <p>The simple version is this: International Rules pairs the round ball and rectangular field of Gaelic football, with the mark (free kick for a clean catch) and rib-crunching tackle of Aussie Rules. It also utilises the Gaelic crossbar on the goals, and the outside posts and four-quarter timing of Aussie Rules. </p> <p>Though the matches are often fun to watch, in a mindless sort of way, it's all based on an uneasy set of compromises and everybody knows it. This maybe explains why its co-organisers \u2013 the GAA and AFL \u2013 changed the competition's name in the late 90s, from the weedy, hesitant Compromise Rules to the thrusting, dynamic International Rules. Give something a new name and logo and people forget all about its past. Well, it worked for New Labour and Starbar/Moro Peanut.</p> <p>It should be pointed out that International Rules actually has a decent past, unlike many makey-uppy games. It all started in the 60s, when Aussie Rules teams toured Ireland and vice-versa, organising a bit of a Gaelic football kickaround with the natives. Incremental changes were made to the rules until a formal 'Test' match series was organised in 1984, reappearing at sporadic intervals.<br> In 1990 the Compromise Rules experiment was abandoned, floored by the killer one-two of dwindling public interest and rising levels of on-pitch violence. Significantly, the latter was the sole reason given for the termination of the 1998-2006 International Rules era, after the inexhaustible professional Australian hordes kicked seven shades of multicoloured doo-dah out of the amateur Irish weaklings, literally, metaphorically and every other way you can think of. International Rules has now <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIoqXuw1Ls\">tentatively returned</a>, with Tests in Perth tomorrow and Melbourne a week later, with strict guarantees from the Aussies that they would rein in the more, how shall we say, 'confrontational' instincts of their players. From a spectator perspective, though, one has to wonder if this is a smart move.</p> <p>Once all the handwringing, breast-beating and strenuous calls of \"Won't anyone think of the children?\" subside, one enormous question stares us in the face. Could it be that the violence in International Rules wasn't such a big problem because it was exactly that which prompted people to tune in or attend matches in the first place? </p> <p>Let's face it: the sport itself, while enjoyable, is also artificial and silly and pointless, a random, helter-skelter 80 minutes of athletes tearing around in circles like a horde of uncommonly muscular hamsters trapped in an electrified cage.<br> But the prospect of a good rumble is always going to get fans' motors humming. It's the modern-day equivalent of the Coliseum \u2013 we hang out in the stands and have a nice day, while beneath us our blood lust is sated in a healthy, controllable, socially sanctioned manner.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA4U8zEMmLM\">International Rules fights were legendary</a>; indeed, it says something that the running battles lasting for 10 minutes are what many of us remember most clearly, and most fondly, from the series' history. I suppose it brought out all those boneheaded, jingoistic feelings, too, watching these distant cousins have a good old dust-up: the grandsons of convicts and \u2013 what the hell, let's throw in another stereotype \u2013 the fighting Irish, in a raw-knuckle slugfest.<br> Regarding its demise two years ago, I had a sneaking feeling that the GAA, while genuinely concerned about violence, were also embarrassed that the Antipodean novices showed a greater proficiency with the round ball than men who had, almost literally in the case of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Qvnyq88-wU\">Kerry footballers</a>, been suckled on one. The next fortnight will tell us if the Irish lads have improved their shooting and fielding skills, whi ... oh, who cares about any of that? Let's get ready to rumble!</p>",
  "<p>In 1940, an artist who was still in his early 20s embarked on the most ambitious and moving American history paintings of the 20th century. Jacob Lawrence set out to tell the story of the great migration, the movement of black American families from the rural south to the urban north. He tells it as folklore, as if the paintings expressed the psyche of the migrants themselves, poor dirt farmers desperate to get away from the oppressions that refused to budge from the south despite what had turned out to be the false dawn of emancipation. Denied access to education, singled out by the police and law courts, African-Americans chose collectively to vote with their feet, or rather their railway tickets, and head to <a href=\"http://www.phillipscollection.org/lawrence/img_teach/migrationpanel1.jpg\">big industrial cities such as Chicago</a> where things - it was rumoured - were better. </p> <p>New York artist Lawrence, so young, made the bold decision to tell this story in paintings united by their laconic style as much as their theme. They take you not into his mind, but into how he imagines the minds of the migrants: anticipating later novels such as Toni Morrison's Beloved, he tries to re-create the mentality of rural people imagining a northern promised land and setting out in search of it. A still life of a juicy joint of meat and a great hunk of bread embodies their image of a more comfortable life in the big cities; a cartoon-like white judge glares down on black prisoners in a comment on the way legal inequality drove them north. Lawrence shows how even as they tried to get on trains, people were arrested and harried; how when they got to Chicago they saw crowds of cattle waiting to die in the city's infamous stockyards. But he also shows how some things really did prove better in the cities - there was education.</p> <p>It is the style that makes these paintings so enduring. In many ways, the young Lawrence resembles the young Pablo Picasso. Just as, in his teens and early 20s, Picasso painted his blue period scenes of poor and outcast lives in Barcelona, the young Lawrence created this great fable of poverty and migration, desolation and hope. Its style is a brilliant reimagination of Picasso's blue period. There is the same ability to re-create an innocent or naive perspective without either patronising the people he portrays or mocking the seriousness of the suffering he relates. Lawrence's Great Migration paintings are owned by New York's MoMA and other American museum collections \u2014 but why are they not permanently on view at MoMA? Together they constitute one of the modern world's most humane aesthetic documents.</p>",
  "<p>A Lake county, Indiana, superior court judge yesterday ordered early voting sites in heavily Democratic cities Hammond, Gary and East Chicago to remain open in a decision that could affect the presidential election in the battleground state.</p> <p>In her decision, Judge Diane Kavadias Schneider dismissed complaints from local Republican officials trying to block the sites on the grounds they violated local election rules and created a risk for voter fraud.</p> <p>Since local Republicans first sought to close the sites two weeks ago, the case has drawn attention from the presidential campaigns of both John McCain and Barack Obama because Indiana is a swing state.</p> <p>\"This is one of a dozen-plus legal actions that our campaign is paying attention to,\" said Ben Porritt, a spokesman for the McCain-Palin campaign. \"Most importantly, the goal of our campaign is to ensure that all eligible voters have an opportunity to vote, and their votes be counted. We obviously back early polling locations, as long as they are done according to state law. While we disagree with this decision, we will continue to monitor any further legal action that takes place.\"</p> <p>Yesterday's ruling was hailed by Democrats because it means more voters in a heavily Democratic region of Indiana have easier access to the polls. In the past, voters had to go to Crown Point, roughly 24 miles (38.6 kilometres) away from East Chicago, to cast early ballots.</p> <p>\"Early voting has been a great success so far in Lake county. Thanks to Judge Kavadias Schneider's ruling today, thousands of Indiana voters had their rights protected and the opportunity granted to take part in early voting,\" said Jonathan Swain, the Indiana spokesman for Obama's campaign. </p> <p>\"No matter which candidate or which party they are voting for, all Hoosiers who are eligible to vote deserve the right to have their voices heard in this critical election.\"</p> <p>Schneider was appointed by the Indiana supreme court to preside over the case brought by John B Curley, chairman of the Lake County Indiana Republican Central Committee, and Jim B Brown, a member of the Lake county board of elections, and others.</p> <p>The plaintiffs alleged that early voting sites in the three cities should not have been opened because there was no unanimous vote by the Lake county board of elections approving the locations.</p> <p>Attorneys from the other side said no unanimous vote was needed by the election board because the three locations - one in each city - are in government offices and not \"satellite\" voting sites. The election board must give unanimous approval for a satellite voting site. Closing the sites would disenfranchise poor and minority voters, the same attorneys said.</p> <p>\"The decision is a complete victory for voters,\" said Jonathan Weissglass, an attorney who represented some of the groups fighting to keep the sites open. \"People in Gary, Hammond and East Chicago: it's very difficult for them to get to Crown Point. There's not good public transportation. People don't have cars or time to make a trip to Crown Point.\"</p> <p>R Lawrence Steele, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, was not available for comment on yesterday.</p>",

  "<p>Sometimes, perhaps on a sunny morning, the light falls on an object, or a room, or a person in a way that momentarily reveals its unexpected beauty - unexpected in that it might be a simple thing like a cup, or a tree, or a pile of books. That moment of revelation lifts the spirits as we take pleasure from the arrangement of ordinary things. Photographs, however, despite their inherent ability to isolate and elevate, often fail to provide this spontaneous feeling of discovery and pleasure, overburdened by the photographer's need to make an important picture-statement rather than let the picture speak for itself.</p> <p>Since the 1980s, reality has been a subject of concern among photographers. Staged photography and the widespread use of digitisation have meant that what was once assumed to be real is now always in question. Even the snapshot, the last repository of spontaneous emotion in photography, has been co-opted by the art world and interrogated as to its theoretical significance.</p> <p>Navigating these times, certain photographers have maintained a more direct approach. Nigel Shafran is a young British photographer who made his living during the 1990s by working for fashion and architecture magazines while quietly collecting, editing and sequencing photographs he made for himself, including portraits of his partner, Ruth, the places that they lived and the locations he walked or cycled through. Periodically he would put some of these pictures together in a homemade book. </p> <p>An early one contained pictures of urban trees. They were the sort of desperate trees you see everywhere in London: struggling saplings in pavement beds, old planes pollarded within an inch of their lives, posh shrubs intended to soften the hard lines of a new building, once-majestic trees that had been built around, built over, dug up and dumped in skips. Shafran's photographs said a lot about the impoverishment of urban spaces and the decline of our more natural, generous instincts, as we inhabit them. </p> <p>In 1993 Shafran made a calendar for 1994. It had a photograph for each month: some of the urban trees were in there, as was a portrait of Ruth. She is sitting in a bedroom that is being redecorated. There is a stepladder, a mug of tea, a black bin-liner filled with rubbish, a stripped bed and stripped walls with patches of old wallpaper showing through. She is in dungarees and a sweatshirt, at right angles to the camera, looking calmly, if slightly sceptically, into the lens. It is a portrait of domestic chaos made meaningful by being part of the process of building a home with someone you love. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338920660\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2008/10/23/4460.jpg\" alt=\"Photographs by Nigel Shafran\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mirror image ... Ruth by Nigel Shafran</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel Shafran</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1994, at an exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery in north London, Shafran exhibited a different portrait of Ruth. She is standing in the bedroom, bleary-eyed, wearing a blue towelling dressing gown and a man's tweed slippers. There is a swirling patterned carpet on the floor and what looks like a packet of contraceptive pills in her hand. Her expression is solemn, but not in the frozen way that suggests a pose. She looks as if she's on her way to the bathroom and has been asked to stand there for a moment for the picture. A year later Shafran compiled 14 of his photographs of Ruth in a small soft-cover book and published it himself. He called it Ruthbook. Three years later he published another book, Dad's Office, a set of rather bleak photographs taken between 1996 and 1998, of the contents of the abandoned rooms from which his father had once worked. </p> <p>After that there were other sets of pictures: one concentrated on the random arrangements of washing-up piled up on the draining board at home; another was a series of interiors of charity shops - \"the only kind of shop where the goods choose the shop rather than the shop choosing the goods,\" as he said in an interview with the curator Charlotte Cotton. He was drawn to collections of things: stacked, boxed, labelled, piled-up: \"How [we] place things can be telling of how and what we are,\" he said. In 2004 a monograph of his work was published as part of a joint initiative between the Brighton-based organisation Photoworks and the international publishers Steidl. It contained edited sequences of many of his past series and included a new set of pictures called Ruth on the phone (1995\u201326 January 2004); the final date marked the birth of their son, Lev.</p> <p>This year Shafran has produced another small book, in its way a sequel to Ruthbook, though the two are not interdependent, called Flowers For -. It contains pictures made over the past four years, during which the family's home life has been reordered by Lev's arrival. These are not modest pictures, in the sense that they are neither naive nor accidental. What prevents them from being over-romantic, or just too personal, comes from the tension between the scenes of disarray within the pictures and the formal control involved in making and sequencing them. They include small domestic landscapes, still lifes and portraits. We are asked to study the detritus involved in bringing up a small child: piles of washing; stacks of disposable nappies; the familiar collection of cookbooks, mugs, plants, radio, bike helmet and ladder that constitutes a suburban kitchen; the mess left by a two-year-old's dinner. We follow the concurrent development of Lev, the extension to their house and their maturing garden. The portraits of Ruth seem to have deepened emotionally.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338930704\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2008/10/23/ruth460new.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth by Nigel Shafran\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chaos theory ...

  "<p>\"Come with me if you want to live.\" This phrase haunts the Terminator franchise, remaining stable while plot logic, internal chronology and authentic characterisation fluctuate around it. It was first said in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247/\">The Terminator</a> to a clueless Sarah Connor by Kyle Reese, a human resistance fighter sent by rebel leader John Connor from a malicious machine-led future controlled by Skynet. Reese protected Sarah Connor from the Terminator, an unstoppable clanking brute played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, and unknowingly fathered \u2026 John Connor, the rebel leader who \u2026 yes, you get it. </p> <p>The phrase reappears in <a href=\"http://www.filmsite.org/term2.html\">Terminator 2: Judgement Day</a>, coming out of the mouth (sorry, not mouth, metal endoskeleton surrounded by living tissue) of a reprogrammed Arnie springing the transformed, tough Sarah Connor out of a psych ward. The quest is to avoid the upgraded, shape-shiftingly stabtastic T1000 and get the scientist Miles Dyson of Cyberdyne Systems to destroy his research, based on a robot arm and microchip left over from the previous film's final skirmish, before he matches present to future and creates Skynet's software. </p> <p>Let's skip over <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181852/\">Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.</a> Claire Danes was a vet, some guy was John Connor, Arnie was a fat, permatanned old Futurama joke. The \"everybody dies but us two\" ending was unexpectedly fly and Kristanna Loken the Terminatrix was brilliant in human form, but her face peeled back to reveal a slimy, tinny, insubstantial CGI cartoon rather than the detailed mechanics which made the series great.</p> <p>\"Come with me if you want to live\" got its TV debut in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0851851/episodes\">The Sarah Connor Chronicles, season one</a>, set a few years after the events of Terminator 2. It was said to John Connor by the ambiguous robot bodyguard, Cameron, played excellently by Summer Glau. The series jigged the timeline so much that even the ever-proliferating Terminators (sent from a future whose space-time causeways must be getting pretty jammed by now) were looked a little jaded around the eyes. Any plot kinks were explained by saying that something or other happens in the future and that Sarah and John need to (a) pre-empt and negate it, (b) deal with traps laid then for them to encounter now and (c) avoid Skynet's assassins, all the time.</p> <p>I've been a fan of the first two Terminator films since I was a kid, for obvious reasons. The gleaming cyborg hardware and real robotics, the open feminism, the cold black and grey look, Linda Hamilton Mark II. On the small screen, however, Sarah was a shrill demon mommy and John was a sulky, lazy youth. Still, I have high hopes for the <a href=\"http://www.virgin1.co.uk/shows/terminator-the-sarah-connor-chronicles/\">second series</a>, which starts tonight at 9pm and introduces <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1276549/\">Shirley Manson</a>, ex frontwoman of Garbage, as the boss of one of those tech conglomerates that all SF dystopias require by law (think of Omni Consumer Products in Robocop and the Farwan Corporation in <a href=\"http://www.annaguirre.com/\">Ann Aguirre's novels</a>). The threat has been trimmed to one buff-but-ugly Terminator, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromartie_(Terminator)\">Cromartie</a>, who wears the aggrieved air of an unsuccessful underwear model. </p> <p>I look forward to it, but one issue sticks in my throat: the idea that in the future, machines will turn on humans. <a href=\"http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_home_page.html\">Isaac Asimov</a>, the classic robophile, identified two themes when it came to robot narratives. There was the robot-as-menace, as the first Terminator or Hal in <a href=\"http://kubrickfilms.warnerbros.com/video_detail/2001/\">2001: a Space Odyssey</a>. Then there was the robot-as-pathos, like the lonely creatures of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/\">Bladerunner</a> who are sensitive to beauty and don't want to die.</p> <p>The menace notion developed in the late 1930s, prompted by society's fears about technology, computers, weaponry and surveillance. But no machine could ever conceive of a genocide the way humans in power visit genocidal violence upon each other. A machine could technically facilitate murder, if programmed to, but lacking the irrational and addictive emotions of hatred, lacking sadism, lacking the pleasure of contemplating inflicting pain, no computer could \"will\" war, rape and murder into being. The gloating silver skulls and zealously glowing red eyes of the Terminators are deceptive: machines feel no exultation at causing pain.</p> <p>The image of a future in which machines are actively hunting all humans \u2013 as opposed to merely reducing us to iPod-zombies with white stringy headphones trailing from our ears \u2013 is a way for morally cowardly humans to avoid thinking about evil as a specifically human sin.</p>",

I'm healthy, happy, I've had five kids, that's going to be in the medical records.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/republicans\">Republicans</a> had previously hinted that Palin, who gave birth to her fifth child this year at the age of 44, would not open her personal files. McCain, as well as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> on the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/democrats\">Democratic</a> ticket, have all revealed at least portions of their medical history.</p> <p>Palin used the phrase \"if they're released\" at the end of her reply to Williams, giving her campaign room to reverse course on the records despite the candidate's agreement.</p> <p>The NBC interview seemed to indicate tension between McCain and his running mate. In the clips shown last night, the Republican nominee appears reluctant to look directly at Palin, whose expensive wardrobe has set off a flood of negative press.</p> <p>Chuck Todd, the NBC political director, remarked on the \"odd body language\" between the pair and wondered on the air if McCain is \"starting to blame her for things? Blaming himself? Is she blaming him?\".</p> <p>\"I couldn't see chemistry with John McCain and Sarah Palin,\" Todd continued. \"I felt as if we could have grabbed two people and said 'Here, sit next to each other, we're going to conduct an interview'.\"</p> <p>A Washington Post/ABC news poll released yesterday found 52% of voters believed Palin's presence on the Republican ticket reflected negatively on McCain's judgment.</p> <p>While some national polls this week have shown McCain closing the gap with Obama, the Democrat maintains a healthy lead in most swing states 12 days before the election.</p>",
  "<p>I don't like the phone. As well as being a carrier of any number of potentially disfiguring diseases, it encourages yapping; pointless extended conversation in which no detail is too inconsequential to expound upon at obscene length. God, I hate the phone. The only thing I use it for is to make multiple entries in TV quizzes.</p> <p>This is why I am in favour of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocall\">robocalls</a>. Actually it's not the only reason, I like the name too; I think more soulless automated functions should have the prefix \"robo\" applied to them \u2013 things robotoothbrush, robocarparkbarrier and, in my case, <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=robosex\">robosex</a>. It makes it sound like we're in the future, already. But I believe in the principle too, it makes a lot of sense.</p> <p>Which is why some of the furore over in the United S of A this week has gone in one eye and out the other. So John McCain has been using robocalls, recorded messages that, when picked up, bluntly articulate a Republican position before disconnecting. Those messages have upset Colin Powell, who <a href=\"http://www.asiantribune.com/?q=node/13800\">cited them</a> as one of the reasons for his endorsing Obama. They've also upset Sarah Palin, who's <a href=\"http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/10/20/1572424.aspx\">decried them</a> as inimical to Thoreau's ideal of the engaged citizen (pretty much). The Obama campaign, meanwhile, is so upset by McCain's robocalls that they've been forced to condemn his tactics, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-10-22-robocalls_N.htm\">in their own series of robocalls</a>. </p> <p>All this controversy has made me want my own robophone. Or, more specifically, I'm hoping that my mum might buy me one. Times are tight, after all, and it would be in my engagements with her that the device would come in most handy. Each week I am expected to call home to inform my dearest relatives as to my wellbeing, professional standing (it does vary that much) and whether I am coming home for Christmas (a topic for discussion even in April). In return I have to spend half an hour hearing about the machinations of my parents' neighbours and their ongoing attempts to breed a monster strain of <a href=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1131/988751081_af5c3b6a67.jpg\">leylandii</a>. With one simple, automated message I could render the whole thing meaningless.</p> <p>It needn't stop there of course. I could save my favourite order so Peaceable Pizzas (they're organic) receive it at exactly the same time every other night. On alternate days, I could do the same with the local Indian. I could lessen the prospect of the office sussing that I wasn't actually missing work because I had typhoid, by denying me the opportunity to talk to me about it. And, of course, I could set up a religion and advertise it through late-night unsolicited phonecalls. After all, there's no room for <a href=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1131/988751081_af5c3b6a67.jpg\">posters on the bus</a> any more.</p> <p>Anyone who followed Homer Simpson's brief career as the <a href=\"http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Lisa's_Date_With_Density\">Happy Dude</a> will know that robocalls only end in tears. (Interestingly, the device Homer uses in this 1996 episode to solicit a dollar from every resident of Springfield is called an autodialler; that we have upgraded from auto to robo in the past 12 years shows how far we have come). But I'm willing to endure the consequences in return for the brief period of control and freedom that robocalling would bring. If anyone could recommend a good make of dialler, I'd be very grateful.</p>",

  "<p>The debut appearance of Dwain Chambers at the Oxford Union, legendary amphitheatre of august debate (and student whimsy) was a fascinating prospect. Chambers had already cancelled one scheduled spot here at the height of his pre-Olympic notoriety. But on Wednesday night Britain's most compelling reformed drug cheat elite athlete finally granted a private audience to the nation's gilded egg-head youth. </p> <p>In the end it was a surprisingly gripping performance, light on doggerel and cant and heavy on that surprising, goofy charm. This was the naked Dwain, the bare forked athlete: his hopes, his fears, his interminable anecdotes. And if it was also a little awkward at times, a little too close to a form of public group-therapy, then this only added to the spectacle. </p> <p>Even before he entered the Union's oak-panelled library, there was a tangible excitement about the place - and this is a venue well used to heavy hitters. Other guests this term include the Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Britain, Chinese writer Jung Chang, Laurence Llewellyn-Bowen and Keith Chegwin. This is the society that has given a platform to both the Dalai Lama and Kermit the Frog. A blend, then, of international statesmen and muppets. Which one is Chambers? He was sharing the bill with the former chancellor of the exchequer Nigel Lawson, if that's any kind of clue.</p> <p>That excitement, then. With ten minutes still to go they were already turning hopeful punters away as a mild outbreak of Dwazzamania prevailed. Say what you like, this man puts bums on seats. Frowning sporty lads made notes. A troupe of loud, posh women colonised the front three rows. And, thrillingly, Dwain kept us waiting in our seats while he pawed at his blocks, brooding, flexing, visualising his opening joke and generally messing with our heads. </p> <p>He entered to wild applause, albeit looking a little nervous. When he spoke it was in a clear, rich voice. It's a good public speaking voice, perhaps even a little too professional and practised. He kicked off with some well worn biographical stuff, all tinged with the air of the itinerant preacher man, the redemptive confessional. This is the essential Chambers shtick now. \"My heart was always drawn to athletics,\" he says of his early years. \"That was where I learnt my lessons in life.\" But what are those lessons exactly?</p> <p>First up there are a lot of hoary tales. It's not long before we're into \"So I'm sitting there cacking myself before the race ... Maurice is pacing up and down\". The legendary American sprinter Maurice Greene crops up a lot here. He's the sprinting equivalent of \"a certain I T Botham\" in Dwain's world - the hero of all his best stories.\"</p> <p>But essentially we're here to get some feel-good stuff about lessons learnt and making the big choices. Dwain's message sounds simple, but it's still oddly paradoxical and confused. \"If I was told by an athlete who never took drugs not to take them, I wouldn't listen,\" he says, as if this were self-evident (rather than perverse). </p> <p>He regrets his mistake, but is still fascinated by its results. After stopping taking seven different substances under the guidance of Victor Conte, founder of the Balco laboratory, he felt \"like a mere mortal again\". He looks deflated just talking about it. \"When I was on [ie on drugs] I never got tired,\" he remembers, dreamily. \"I was just a machine. I could run and run.\" This kind of stuff makes your spine tingle. </p> <p>There are lyrical touches, too. \"It's like in the Matrix. Neo was left with the red pill and the green pill. I was like that too - I wanted to see how deep the rabbit hole was\". This is a new take: Dwain as psychedelic adventurer, the Timothy Leary of sprint. </p> <p>He gives us some hair-raising insights into the drug cheat industry. The notorious Balco Drug programme is compared to an F1 mechanics team in its intensity. There was mass support, control tests, guinea pig athletes. Dwain still talks almost fondly about \"Victor\". You get the feeling he liked other things about being in the Balco gang besides the drugs: perhaps even the unlikely camaraderie, the feeling of elite corps transgression. </p> <p>There are some hard edges when he talks about his British peers on the track. He's magnanimous about his former relay team-mate Darren Campbell's ongoing hostility (\"I understand his frustrations. I would feel the same\"); but less so about others (\"I'm sure we can develop in the relay - once we get Craig Pickering off the last leg!\" (greeted by unexpected whoops of laughter: Pickering dropped the baton at the Olympics). </p> <p>There's also plenty of unintentional humour. \"I have to be positive, it's in my blood,\" he says later, which could have saved us all lot of time with all that testing and B samples. We hear about a philanthropic project for his retirement: \"I want to go out there and find a white man who can run under 10 seconds,\" he announces, conjuring an image of something involving binoculars and a butterfly net. </p> <p>There's pathos too. We hear about the times he was \"on the floor cramping for over an hour\" at the Commonwealth Games; and the fact that members of his family no longer speak to him. While he was on drugs Chambers eventually stopped running the 200m purely (he says) out of loyalty to British team-mate Christian Malcolm, a good friend: \"I kept destroying him. It was eating me up.\" Of his Olympic exclusion he says simply: \"I wasn't going and that killed me. I still haven't had the chance to cry.\"</p> <p>There are casual revelations. On the botched and comical rugby league try-out at Castleford Tigers: \"really and truly, it was only a PR stunt.\" Although, oddly now he says the high he got from the league fitness regime was the closest natural thing he's ever found to drugs. His training is now \"rugby-based, and hopefully it's going to pay off in my progress next year\". </p> <p>Fascinatingly, he remains convinced he would have won a medal in Beijing. \"I sincerely believe that,\" he says without hesitation. \"Purely because I've had to deal with more pressure than anyone there. I believe I would have done it.\"</p> <p>Still, as he exits to loud applause you can't help feeling a little sad about the terrible waste of talent in all this: Britain's fastest 100m man reduced to the travelling circus of the novelty speaker. You have to remind yourself that Chambers will actually run again. Never mind the seminars and the hug-ins, the most significant thing to have happened to him of late is the public olive branch extended by UK Athletics chief executive Niels De Vos, who last month announced that \"if [Chambers] qualifies and meets the selection criteria he will be available the same as any other athlete\". </p> <p>Chambers is effectively back in the fold now. So what is he doing here? The righteous, prosthletysing tone is the ostensible justification for this kind of jaunt. And the chance to spread that message seems genuinely to excite him. </p> <p>Then there are the peculiar side effects of the drug ban and its attendant publicity. This seems to have created another Dwain Chambers, the public inspirationalist, the autodidact celebrity. At times you feel Chambers is as fascinated by that side of himself as he once was - and apparently still is - by his physical capabilities. </p> <p>Plus, of course, he still owes \u00a3130,000 in falsely awarded race fees. Hence the imminent autobiography, plus the mouthwatering revelation here that \"I've got my eye on boxing next\". As he says, \"I have no sponsors, ultimately you look at where I am now, it wasn't worth it\". </p> <p>It's a slightly deflating note to end on, but a reminder after all the giggles of why we're there in the Oxford Union. Those cramps. The lonely hotel rooms. The freezer full of junk. The shame. The disgust. Dwain, you feel - and perhaps even to his credit - still has a way to go with this.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>&#xa0;</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Preamble: </strong> A warning to everyone out there who thinks telling the truth is a good idea. After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/oct/23/tottenhamhotspur-uefa\">David Bentley told the world that Spurs are way below slightly below average</a> \u2013 which we kind of knew anyway \u2013 Juande Ramos has dropped the maverick whistleblower from the squad. If you don't believe me check these teams out:</p> <p><strong>Udinese:</strong> Handanovic, Motta, Coda, Domizzi, Lukovic, Inler,<br>D'Agostino, Isla, Sanchez, Quagliarella, Di Natale. <strong>Subs:</strong><br>Koprivec, Sala, Ferronetti, Pasquale, Obodo, Pepe, Floro Flores.</p> <p><strong>Tottenham: </strong>Gomes, Hutton, King, Woodgate, Assou-Ekotto, Lennon,<br>Zokora, Jenas, O'Hara, Bale, Bent. <strong>Subs:</strong> Cesar, Dawson,<br>Gilberto, Gunter, Modric, Campbell, Giovani.<br><strong>Referee: </strong>Felix Brych (Germany)</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>It's not going to be easy for Juande tonight: </strong>Udinese are second in Serie A. If they lose it's not going to be a disaster for their Uefa Cup campaign, seeing as you need to lose 698 games before there's the slightest chance of a team missing out on the last 256, but it will put several spiral-galaxy sized holes in what is already a sinking ship. Or a sunk ship.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>1 min: </strong>And we're off. \"If your photo is any evidence, Spurs have experienced men in charge,\" says El Naylor. \"Such men know that in the shark-infested waters of the business of football, it's best to count your fingers regularly.\"</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>3 min: </strong>Ledley King is back by the way and should be around until he suffers a horrific injury from a low-flying moth in the 63rd minute, poor lad. Hutton is unfairly penalised for a friendly tackle, but Udinese can't exploit the free-kick.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>5 min: </strong>This is the Spurs we know and love. They give away another free-kick - just outside the area - and Quagliarella sneaks in to head just wide. As for the marking, it wasn't there.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>8 min: </strong>Sanchez has started to take the pee already: he completes 10 stepovers before floating a cross over that isn't quite accurate enough to trouble Spurs.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>11 min: </strong>\"Easy! Easy!\" chants Mark Walker at no one in particluar, clearly delighted at Spurs canny stifling of their opposition away in Europe. Spurs first moment of threat sees Lennon skipping down the right and delivering a cross that's easily gathered by Handanovic.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>14 min: </strong>Handanovic tries to dish out a bit of charity to Spurs by fluffing his clearance, but throw-ins do not famous European victories make and Udinese clear.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>15 min: </strong>Ha! That throw-in helped out. Bent has a free-ish header about 10-yards out, but heads straight at the keeper.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>17 min: in which I am told where to go: </strong>\"Bentley wasn't dropped for speaking out he was dropped for being rubbish and lacking passion,\" Jerry Thomas. \"Time to give it a chance to players who actually give a toss instead of acting like a big time Charlie.\"</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>20 min: </strong>Spurs aren't playing too badly actually. Lennon is causing plenty of problems down the right and just had a shot which Handanovic had to palm away. \"Just wanted to share with your readers this graph posted in an Icelandic equivalent of The Sun, <a href=\"http://www.dv.is/sport/2008/10/21/gengi-kronunnar-og-tottenham-svipad/\">comparing Spurs fortunes in the league in the last few years with the Icelandic kr\u00f3na's exchange rate</a>,\" says the helpful Kjartan Kjartansson. \"Not surprisingly by their respective current situation they're remarkably similar. Unlike the Spurs fans though, we still have a level of optimism about our future prospects.\"</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>PENALTY! </strong>Gomes pushes over the Udinese player in the area as they vie for the ball. \"As an American, I do not understand the term Hotspur,\" says notorious American Patrick Sullivan. \"In America, it probably refers to a cowboy's byproduct from an hour in a house of ill repute. Please clarify.\" These days, that's not far of what it means in Britain either.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Udinese 1-0 Spurs (Di Natale 23min)</strong> Di Natale strikes it hard and low to Gomes' right. Gomes is capable of incredible saves but he looked suspect when Spurs faced him in Europe last year (even if he did save a few penalties in the shoot out). I thought he was a ridiculous buy then and surprisingly still do now.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>27 min: </strong>The shame for Spurs is that they were playing really well at the start of the game and it looked like this game might, <em>might</em>, be the one to turn things round.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>29 min: </strong>Spurs bring a bit of calm with some interplay in midfield. \"Heurleho Gomes did a decent Paul Robinson impression there,\" chortles George Templeton. \"All he needed to do was whiff on trying to control the ball and have it end up in the back of the net and it would've been spot on.\"</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>33 min: </strong>Lennon launches a stunning counter-attack, sprinting up the field before tripping over himself. You don't like to laugh but well... \"I think I can answer the Hotspur conundrum (min 20),\" chirrups Niall Larkin. \"It's named after Harry Hotspur, a character from Henry V by one W Shakespeare. The spurs players are playing like a bunch of board trodding, costumed, etc etc\".</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>35 min: </strong>Spurs <em>are</em> still attacking. Bale has a free-kick in the edge of the area, which he curls over. Here's satire's Richard Tenser: \"That photo looks like Ramos and Comolli are working out their payoffs, 'number of years times number of millions a year equals how much?! Wow this could turn out to be a great season for us after all!'\"</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>36 min: </strong>King does well to take the ball off Di Natale, and strokes the ball up the pitch ... to an Udinese player. He's not injured yet though.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>38 min: </strong>Since the penalty, Gomes has continued to flap, quiver and punch at anything that comes near him. \"Why doesn't he just catch it?\" wonders the commentator. Because he can't.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>42 min: </strong>Spurs have a few potshots, but when they need to, Udinese control the game. \"Spurs are still talked about as 'underperforming' this season, with the focus recently on Ramos' tactics, the 'lack of passion', and now Bentley's comment. But I'd like to posit a new reason for their poor start - they've just got a rubbish team,\" says Thomas Midlane. \"Look at that midfield: Lennon (no end product), Zokora (no beginning or middle product either), Jenas (God he tries), O' Hara (about 12), and Bale (looks like a member of Busted. And like he might still read the Beano). Add to that a captain made of Balsa wood, and you've got a team so lightweight, you could stand on a windy hillside and fly them in the breeze.\" That's a bit harsh, Bale looks more of a Dandy man.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>43 min: </strong>Lukovic pulls the ball back from the byline after a wee bit of twisting and turning, but there's no one to get the final shot in.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>45min (and half time, you'll get no injury time here): </strong>Hutton blasts a shot way over. That was symbolic of Spurs' half. They've got into plenty of good positions, then either spannered it over, fallen over or had a breakdown. \"Perhaps in that photo Ramos and Comolli are guestimating the number days left before they both get the sack,\" says Richard Whitall. \"In which case they should only have to count to one.\"</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>Half-time summary of half-time summary. </strong>\"I'm loving Ray Houghton's comments on Five,\" writes Jerry Thomas. \"'If they stop letting in goals at the back and score a few they'll be OK.' Thanks for that Ray.\"</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>46 min: </strong>Modric is on Assou-Ekotto. \"I know Ramos banned cola from the Spurs team, but what did he replace it with?\" asks Gavin Hutchinson. \"Gin? I've never seen a team trip over their own feet and generally stumble around like drunkards so much.\" Nah, they'd just be a bit maudlin if it was gin. They've got the look of men on paintstripper to me.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>48 min: </strong>Modric plays a half-decent ball with the outside of his foot, which Jenas ushers out for a throw-in. Hmmm. \"Heurelho Gomes is the Sarah Palin of goalkeepers,\" trumpets Daniel Shalin. I've always seen Sven as more of a Palin character: the glasses, the librarian look brimming over with barely hidden sexuality, the bottling of major campaigns.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>51 min: </strong>Bale and his magical* left-foot lift another free-kick over the bar. Spurs might want to look to another player on deadballs because he has delivered nothing of value tonight. Gomes then palms a shot low to his right. Gomes is good in that kind of position, it's just when he needs to show composure he breaks down.</p> <p>* Actual left-foot may not be magical.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>53 min: </strong>Modric has looked pretty good since he came on and wins a corner after working some space in Udinese's area. For all the Spurs woe at the moment, they are only 1-0 down and 1-1 against a side who are second in Serie A would be a very good result.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>55 min: </strong>Zokora gives the ball away and D'Agostino is closed down by O'Hara as he unleashes a shot. O'Hara's intervention is just to put him off and the ball goes high and wide.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>58 min: </strong><strong>RED CARD!</strong> O'Hara, who was booked a few seconds earlier, flies in to a challenge on Sanchez and gets his second yellow. On a more positive note, Gomes just caught the ball cleanly <em>and</em> saved another.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>62 min: </strong>Lennon, who you may remember from a few promising runs in the first-half almost creates a chance for Spurs. Gomes is then caught out of position after some dreadful defending and Di Natale's lob is saved brilliantly. But Gomes shouldn't have been standing five miles off his line. \"I know Spurs commentary has progressed, appropriately, past critique to ridicule, but as a generous feeling Yankee Gooner, might I politely suggest that losing 90 percent of your goals from one year to the next poses a managerial dilemma that buying Modric and Bentley is not likely to solve,\" says Giles. \"And might I also say that Berbatov is really good and Robbie Keane is a c...\" No you can't.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>64 min: </strong>Giovani is on for Woodgate and nearly slides it past Handanovic.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>66 min: </strong>Bale shins the ball off for a throw: there might of been a Paul Robinson in Croatia-style bobble, but that sums up Spurs night so far.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>70 min: </strong>Udinese play a nice series off passes through midfield. They still haven't scored the killer second goal but unlike the first-half, Spurs are no longer posing any kind of threat going forward.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>73 min: </strong>Oh, Gareth. He runs back to collect a loose ball, but gives away a corner that Udinese can't exploit.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>75 min: </strong>Oh, Heurelho. Gomes juggles the ball comically and Udinese nearly lash the ball in, a free-kick to Spurs is given to save the keeper's blushes. A little bit.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>77 min: </strong>D'Agostino pushes Giovani over and Spurs are in sight of Udinese's goal for the first time in 10 minutes or so. Bale's spectacular form on free-kicks continues as he manages to deliver a set-piece that is cunningly neither a shot nor a cross.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>80 min: </strong>Quagliarella is through on Gomes, but he's clearly offside. Incredibly, Spurs are still in this game.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>83 min: </strong>Modric nearly works an opening in the area, and wins a throw-in in a fairly good position. The fact that an attacking throw in is a cause of excitement for Spurs tell you quite a bit.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>85 min: </strong>That throw-in worked wonders. Giovani surges down the right, crosses and Bent's header is saved well by Handanovic.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Udinese 2-0 Spurs (Pepe 85min)</strong>Udinese catch Spurs on the break, the ball is squared to Pepe and he slams the ball past Gomes.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>89 min: </strong>That header from Bent had the air of a final chance, and so it proved. Udinese have been far from brilliant tonight, but 2-0 is about the right result. Spurs really should have exploited the chances they had in the first-half. Since then: nothing.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>90 min: </strong>Two minutes of extra time for Gomes to negotiate without flapping.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>PEEEP! </strong>Spurs shouldn't be too harshly judged on this match. Gomes' individual error effectively cost them a game they had started well, and an away defeat at a good side isn't exactly a defeat by Stoke. If they lose to Bolton at the weekend though ... well that would be another story.</p>",
  "<p>Next week sees the airing of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/18/horror-channel4\">Dead Set</a>, a five-part zombie thriller set in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/bigbrother\">Big Brother</a> house and penned by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/charliebrooker\">Charlie Brooker</a>. But there's more to zombies than fake blood and prosthetic peeling skin. Reanimation, mind control and zombifying parasites are more real and more terrifying than any horror film. </p> <p>Zombies made their debut in the world's consciousness in 1889 via the pages of Harper's Magazine. A short article by amateur anthropologist Lafcadio Hearn reported stories of the <em>corps cadavres</em> \u2013 \"the walking dead\" \u2013 haunting the Caribbean nation of Haiti. Almost 100 years later, Harvard ethnobotanist Wade Davis travelled to Haiti to investigate. Writing about his experiences in The Serpent and the Rainbow, he claimed that <a href=\"http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/ttx/ttx.htm\">tetrodotoxin</a>, the poison of the deadly <a href=\"http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/fish/pufferfish.html?nav=A-Z\">pufferfish</a>, was the chemical agent responsible. Using this drug, a voodoo priest known as a houngan could induce a death-like state in a victim, from which the victim was then partially revived and made to live as a mindless slave. However, this doesn't match the known pharmacology of tetrodotoxin, and to date there's no hard evidence to support Davis's claim. </p> <p>By the time Davis's book hit the shelves, the CIA had been engaged in its own zombie-creation scheme for over 30 years. The clandestine <a href=\"http://www.michael-robinett.com/declass/c000.htm\">Project MKULTRA</a> was created in 1953 to develop the CIA's interrogation, behaviour-modification and mind-control abilities. This involved dosing unsuspecting subjects with drugs such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temazepam\">temazepam</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mescaline.org/\">mescaline</a>, <a href=\"http://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms.shtml\">psilocybin</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_thiopental\">Sodium Pentothal</a>; more inventive techniques such as hypnosis, sub-aural frequency blasts, and sleep deprivation were also employed. When details of MKULTRA surfaced there was a public outcry; the programme was officially abandoned and all records ordered destroyed. Whether the CIA ever discovered the zombie formula remains unknown. </p> <p>Soviet scientists had their own zombie-themed research, retold in the snappily-titled <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ap1co5ZZHYE\">1940s video Experiments in the Revival of Organisms</a>. Although the veracity of the video is in question, the experiments it depicts \u2013 such as keeping a dog's severed head alive with artificial circulation \u2013 are in keeping with research of the time. This work would go one to inform procedures such as open-heart surgery and organ transplant, though <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/92143/resident.evil\">Resident Evil</a>-style zombie dogs were thankfully confined to the laboratory bench.</p> <p>All this, however, pales in comparison to examples found in nature. Parasitic species outnumber the free-living a mighty four to one, and display high proficiency in infecting and enslaving their hosts. Take for instance the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_cockroach_wasp\">emerald cockroach wasp (<em>Ampulex compressa</em>)</a>. The female preys on cockroaches, driving her sting directly into the brain of the unfortunate insect. The venom destroys the roach's escape reflex; it is then buried alive along with a single wasp egg. Once hatched, the wasp larva burrows into its living host and devours it from the inside. Infamous <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dahmer\">serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer</a> once attempted a similar feat, trepanning one of his victims and injecting acid into their brain to create a zombie, without success.</p> <p>Another parasite, <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma\">Toxoplasma gondii</a></em>, infects rats and mice. In order to reach its final host, a cat, the protozoan reprograms the host's behaviour. The rat becomes bolder, losing its instinctual fear of cats. This foolhardy conduct ends up delivering it to the jaws of a passing cat, and the brain-warping parasite is passed on. <em>T gondii</em> will infect just about any warm-blooded animal, including humans, and recent research shows it can modify our behaviour too. Infected men become more suspicious, women become more outgoing. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12095427\">Infected drivers are more likely to be involved in a car crash</a>. It's estimated that 40% of the world's human population is infected via cat faeces. So if you really want to find a mind-altered zombie, the best place to start looking might be a mirror.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> London. </p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Dan Barrow (drums), Sion Penny (bass), Michael James (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Jon Sheehan (keyboards), John J Cooper (guitar). </p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> Franz Ferdinand have already recorded a collaboration with original punk-funk Scots-popsters Fire Engines, and it was great, while their team-up with Xenomania was less successful and scrapped, but what if they teamed up next with the Fall? They'd probably sound a bit like Burning Pilot, a five-piece from the stable that brought us the Subways, Mystery Jets and Ladyfuzz. Their frontman Michael James doesn't so much sing as intone darkly in a semi-spoken drone, a voice that resembles Mark E Smith at his most inscrutable and irritable, enigmatic and obscure. As for the music, guitars and synthesisers are used with equal gusto, and rhythms are generally of the jerky variety, making a song like Can't Get a Kidder sound like post-punk-era ska given a makeover by an electronica producer. Meanwhile, the air of mystery extends to the pseudonyms used by the five band members, who employ channel numbers instead of names \u2013 eg Ch # 1: drums, Ch # 4: keyboards \u2013 while the keyboard lines, with their shades of the Stranglers circa No More Heroes, add to the sense of menace and justify the recent description of Burning Pilot as \"as threatening as a night out in Coventry in 1979\". <br> Accelerate, the opening track on their debut album Cold Caller, is a misnomer, moving at mid-pace like Franz's Take Me Out in a tussle with a Fall eager not to make too many concessions to commercialism or modernity. What Burning Pilot do is appealing but nothing new: Case History could be any synth-charged new wave band from 1978, although the bass throbs against the snaking, darting keyboard melody to powerful, pleasant effect.

  "<p>The Virgin west coast Pendolino service which left London for Glasgow Central on February 23 last year derailed slightly south of Grayrigg, in Cumbria, at 8.15pm.</p> <p>Passengers described the train starting to rock and sway before they heard a loud bang and the carriages went dark. </p> <p>They told how they heard the shouts and screams of the injured when they were thrown about as all nine carriages derailed.</p> <p>One passenger, 84-year-old Margaret Masson, from Glasgow, died. Many others were hurt when the high-speed train, which was reported to have been travelling at up to 95mph, derailed with 111 passengers and four members of staff on board. </p> <p>A total of 28 passengers, one crew member and the driver, Iain Black, were seriously injured. Fifty other passengers sustained minor injuries.</p> <p>Black was praised for his heroism after staying in his seat to make sure passengers were safe. He was trapped for an hour, and was only able to return to work in May this year.<br> Around 500 rescuers attended the scene but were hampered by rain, darkness and difficult access. </p> <p>In the immediate aftermath, the investigation focused on the condition of points at the crossover known as Lambrigg, with the early indications being that these had been the immediate cause of the derailment.</p> <p>Following fears that the accident had been caused by faulty points, Network Rail checked more than 700 sets of points across the country but found nothing of concern. </p> <p>Two earlier reports into the crash, including an interim report three days after it happened, have been published. </p> <p>In the reports, the Rail Accident Investigation Branch, part of the transport department, said the immediate cause was that points at the site were in a \"degraded and unsafe state\".<br> Investigators said the points were in an unsafe condition through a combination of failures of the three stretcher bars, the lock stretcher bar and their fastenings. </p> <p>Immediately after the interim report was published, Network Rail said it accepted the findings \"in all respects\" and apologised. </p> <p>As part of the investigation by the British Transport police, a 46-year-old Network Rail employee from Preston was arrested on July 11 2007 and released on bail.</p> <p>Two other Network Rail employees, also both from Preston, were arrested in November 2007 and also later released on bail.</p> <p>This month, transport police said two of the rail workers would not face charges. The third has had bail extended to November 3.</p> <p>The Grayrigg derailment followed a long period without accidents on the railways. </p> <p>The last major incident had been at Ufton Nervet, in Berkshire, in November 2004, when a high-speed train hit a car on a level crossing, killing five passengers and the drivers of the car and train. </p> <p>The rail accident branch also examined similarities between Grayrigg and the derailment at Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, which killed seven people in May 2002. </p> <p>There were nuts missing from a set of points at Potters Bar and the lock stretcher bar had fractured. The train derailed after it could not take the correct path across the points.</p>",

  "<p>The Home Office today provoked a major row when it blamed inaccurate police record-keeping for an apparent 22% rise in the number of the most serious violent crimes in England and Wales.</p> <p>Senior Home Office officials said at least 13 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales - possibly as many as 17 - had <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs08/hosb1408.pdf\">previously been undercounting crimes [PDF]</a> that should have been classified as GBH with intent as less serious violent assaults.</p> <p>After officials said the practice could have been going on for years, Humberside police confirmed it was one of the forces involved.</p> <p>The police minister, Vernon Coaker, who would not name the other forces, said he was not embarrassed by the disclosure.</p> <p>\"I would be embarrassed if I wasn't coming forward ... and not trying to draw to public attention something that is important,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I want the statistics to be as accurate as possible. We have every confidence in the crime statistics.\" </p> <p>The row over the impact of counting rules masked a generally impressive set of quarterly crime figures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338926492\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2008/10/23/recorded_crime.gif\" alt=\"Graphic - recorded crime\" width=\"276\" height=\"461\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The data showed offences fell by 6% in the 12 months to June 2008 in both the British crime survey (BCS) and in police crime records.</p> <p>Violent crime remained stable on the BCS figures.

The proportion of those resulting in injury fell by 15%.</p> <p>The dispute over the counting rules has not affected the overall downward picture for all violent crime. It relates to the category of offence in which the 13 forces have classified some serious incidents. </p> <p>Professor Paul Wiles, the director of Home Office research and statistics, said the forces had not been counting violent incidents as GBH if the victim had not actually suffered serious injuries.</p> <p>The counting rules were clarified by the Home Office in April to ensure all cases in which there is clear evidence of intent to commit GBH are included in the more serious category, whether or not there are serious injuries. </p> <p>The Home Office gave the example of somebody who broke a bottle on a table and hit a person in the face with it but only succeeded in cutting their nose.</p> <p>The change in classification led to a doubling of the number of GBH incidents with intent reported by the 13 forces.</p> <p>This month they were asked to revise their figures and reported that two-thirds of the increase was accounted for by the rule change.</p> <p>The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, said the change meant today's figure showing a 22% rise in most serious violent crime against the person was <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/news/statement-crime-stats\">not able to be compared with last year's</a>.</p> <p>\"For most types of violence where the guidance hasn't changed - like homicide, robbery and death by driving - the numbers are down since last year,\" she said.</p> <p>Keith Bristow of the Association of Chief Police Officers said police supported the change in the counting rules and it was not an ethical question for officers.</p> <p>\"The impact of changes made to the way in which some crime is recorded will make uncomfortable reading,\" he said.</p>",

  "<p>In his third Test, his bowling set up a winning position for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/indiacricketteam\">India</a> at a venue where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/westindiescricketteam\">West Indies</a> had lost only twice in six decades. These were the 1990s though, and India simply didn't win overseas Tests, even if they had only 120 to chase. Because of that calamitous collapse to 81 all out, few remember <a href=\"http://www.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/match/63747.html\">Abey Kuruvilla's finest hour</a>.</p> <p>Until the still-growing Ishant Sharma came along, the 6'6\" Kuruvilla, born in Kerala but raised in Mumbai, had been the tallest quick bowler to play for India. He won all of his 10 caps in 1997, either side of his 29th birthday, and then faded from the scene. Ignored when in his prime in the early 1990s, he was merely another example of the stepmotherly treatment given to those that bowled with the new ball.</p> <p>Kuruvilla was a fringe player at best. Javagal Srinath, who finished with more Test wickets than Darren Gough and Andy Caddick, certainly wasn't. In the first half of the '90s when he was at his quickest, Srinath nudged the speed gun as far as Allan Donald did. But while the South Africans built a superb team around the pace of the White Lightning, Srinath continued to be an afterthought in the Indian scheme of things.</p> <p>That strategy revolved around spin-friendly surfaces at home and as many as three spinners in every game. It paid rich dividends at home \u2013 England were thrashed 3-0 in 1993 \u2013 but also contributed greatly to the team's haplessness overseas. Between his debut at the Gabba in November 1991 and a match-winning 6 for 21 against South Africa at Ahmedabad five years later, Srinath played just 20 Tests for India. It's worth noting that Anil Kumble aside, none of the spinners that were part of the decade-long home dominance took even 100 wickets.</p> <p>It just makes you wonder how much Srinath might have achieved if his career hadn't been such a stop-start one, if he'd played more than 67 Tests in 11 seasons. How might he have done with a John Wright or Gary Kirsten as coach, and in an environment where pace bowlers are cherished, rather than viewed as clods to take the shine off the new ball?</p> <p>In a sense, Ishant, Zaheer Khan, Rudra Pratap Singh and Sreesanth are reaping the benefits of the thankless work that Srinath, Kuruvilla and Venkatesh Prasad, the present bowling coach, did. In England in 1996, and again in South Africa a few months later, Srinath and Prasad matched those that took the new ball for the opposition, and reminded everyone that there was more to Indian cricket than wristy batsmen and legendary spin quartets.</p> <p>It's worth remembering that the first two Indian bowlers to make a mark in the international arena were Mohammad Nissar and Amar Singh, neither known for the googly or loopy off break. Nissar, a giant of a man from the Punjab, took 5 for 93 in India's opening Test at Lord's and four years later, Amar Singh had 6 for 35 at the same venue. Wally Hammond, who knew a little bit about the art of batting, was to say that Singh was \"as dangerous an opening bowler as I have ever seen, coming off the pitch like the crack of doom\".</p> <p>In the years that followed though, there was only gloom for Indian pace. Pitches that had as much bounce as a mattress and a mindset that refused to think along the lines of a balanced bowling attack meant that India became the land where opening batsmen took the new ball. Just across the border, things were very different, with Fazal Mahmood, Khan Mohammad, Sarfraz Nawaz and Imran Khan establishing a tradition that has been carried on by the likes of Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and Shoaib Akhtar.</p> <p>When Indian pace did eventually revive, it was because of two men. First, Kapil Dev came along and exploded the myth that you had to be a county trundler to bowl beautiful outswing. Then, in the late 1980s, Ravi Mammen of the Madras Rubber Factory set up the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai. Dennis Lillee was the guru, and TA Sekar, who played two Tests in Pakistan in 1983, the man on the ground overseeing the day-to-day operations.</p> <p>Srinath, Prasad and a subsequent generation of aspiring pace bowlers, all spent time at the Foundation housed on the grounds of a school in Chennai. And despite the barbs directed its way down the years, it continued to work with the finest talent at India's disposal, while also opening its doors to overseas talent that wished to become more au fait with Indian conditions.</p> <p>The seeds planted two decades ago have borne fruit in the new millennium. Indian victories at the WACA, the Adelaide Oval, Trent Bridge and the Wanderers were all inspired by the pace attack. When Mickey Arthur asked for pace and bounce at the Bullring in December 2006, it was South Africa that were routed for 84, with Sreesanth producing as fine an exhibition of quick outswing as you'll ever see.</p> <p>In Perth earlier this year, Ishant had Ricky Ponting fumbling like a teenager on a first date. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/oct/20/india-australia-cricket-second-test\">At Mohali last week, he was just as lethal</a> and Ponting said of his second-innings dismissal: \"That ball would have got me out 95 times out of 100\". A few minutes after Ponting's off stump had been uprooted, Ishant produced more prodigious movement in to see off Shane Watson. I was watching from the ABC commentary box at the time and Glenn Mitchell just shook his head. \"Best fast bowler in the world right now,\" he said. There was no qualifying it with the word 'young'.</p> <p>Zaheer, another MRF product, is bowling better than ever, as dangerous with reverse-swing as Wasim once was, while RP Singh, on the Honours Board at Lord's, and Sreesanth wait patiently in line behind Munaf Patel, who sent England tumbling to defeat on debut. Then there's Irfan Pathan, with a Test hat-trick to his name, and a flotilla of young hopefuls like Sudeep Tyagi, Pradeep Sangwan and Manpreet Gony.</p> <p>Amit Mishra has already shown that rumours of Indian spin's demise are greatly exaggerated and with Ishant of the Medusa hair leading the way, the land of the record-breaking batsmen could soon have a bowling arsenal that's the envy of the world.</p>",
  "<p>In a key scene from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/125819/kidnap\">Kidnap</a>, Imran Khan's second big movie of the year (following his lead role in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/125233/jaane.tu.ya.jaane.na\">Jaane Tu ... Ya Jaane Na</a>), his character grips a phone to his ear as his nemesis, Vikrant Raina, tells him to go to hell.</p> <p>\"Hell is right here, Raina,\" he replies before hanging up.</p> <p>\"No it isn't!\" I wanted to scream. \"It's right here! In this god-forsaken cinema seat, from where I'm watching your lame, life-sapping performance!\" </p> <p>Imran Khan is a big star who's only going to get bigger here. He's very handsome, very well connected (he's related to the star Aamir Khan), and has the boring goody two-shoes appeal that captivates the typical Indian female. These qualities will continue to obscure the fact that he is possibly the most talentless, one-dimensional actor around. Compared with him, the average shop-window dummy is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/robertdeniro\">Robert De Niro</a> at his methodical best. I've seen sideboards give more moving performances than this guy has managed in his first two films, both of which (inexplicably to me) have become hits.</p> <p>Khan plays Kabir Sharma, a man seeking revenge having been imprisoned as an adolescent after he stole a billionaire's classic Mercedes soft-top in order to take his friend to hospital after he fell off a ladder at the orphanage where they both lived. God only knows how drunk the writers were when cooking up this script. In the process, he also unwittingly kidnaps the billionaire's spoilt daughter, Sonia (Minissha Lamba), putting her in a coma when he drives straight into a tree. Traumatised, the billionaire seeks the harshest penalty for him despite the cops' pleas that he's basically a good kid. That billionaire (worth $51.7billion, no less), was Vikrant Raina, played by Sanjay Dutt, upon whom Kabir wreaks the most stupid, most tedious and least plausible vengeance in cinema history.</p> <p>Having suffered all sorts of floggings and stabbings in prison - all relayed in black-and-white animation during the opening credits - Kabir is released only to kidnap Sonia again, this time deliberately, holding her in a hideaway so he can phone Raina and force him to perform various absurd penances, including stealing a business rival's illegal fortune, breaking someone out of jail and finally shooting a stranger in a nightclub. </p> <p>But Kabir's plan is complicated after he gawps at Sonia's trashily displayed cleavage and falls in love with her, and also after Raina hires a top-notch private detective to help catch him. The detective fits a few cameras in the garden, and tells him he's also had caller ID installed on the phone. Raina nods with satisfaction knowing that India's best security expert has kitted him out with a standard BT home package. When the phone loudly rings, the words \"Incoming Call\" duly flash on a laptop and the detective excitedly informs Raina that \"We have an incoming call\". But Kabir thwarts their cunning by deviously switching to an office line. The laptop flashes \"Restricted Number\" and the detective gnashes his teeth, conceding to Raina that \"It's a restricted number\".</p> <p>Equally hilarious is the scene in which Raina has to break Kabir's friend from jail. Raina's beautiful ex-wife (Vidya Malvade), sporting a huge Dolly Parton bouffant, a mini-skirt and high heels, drives a huge lorry to the prison gates in the middle of the night and is stopped by a guard who asks her why she's there. \"I'm a human rights activist,\" she replies, and is ushered in without further ado.</p> <p>To cut a long and very boring story short, Kabir's games with Raina are only a strategy to make him say sorry for putting him inside - which he eventually does. Sonia is returned unharmed, Raina and his ex get back together, and Kabir lands a job in IT - the textbook happy Indian ending. </p> <p>Terrible as it is, the film is moderately redeemed by Sanjay Dutt. One of Bollywood's most charismatic actors, he has an overweight, jaded, vulnerable yet menacing presence akin to John Travolta in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/56612/pulp.fiction\">Pulp Fiction</a> - only better. His face teeters between seeming deeply kind and horribly evil. If <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/quentintarantino\">Tarantino</a> were to do a Bollywood epic (which he should, given his genius for kitsch and hysteria), Dutt is the man to star in it. He was eminently watchable throughout, and the entertaining Punjabi song routine he performs shows he can still move - albeit slower than before.</p> <p>However, replacing Khan with a cardboard cut-out and comic book speech bubbles would have produced a better central performance and would at least have added a broader comedic flavour. If he wants to be more than just a pretty boy Khan needs to watch Dutt and learn a great deal more.</p>",
  "<p>Campaigners failed today in a high court bid to force the government to spend more to end fuel poverty.</p> <p>Mr Justice McCombe, sitting in London, dismissed an application for judicial review brought by Friends of the Earth and Help the Aged to force the government to meet its targets for helping millions of vulnerable citizens who cannot adequately heat their homes.</p> <p>The judge ruled that government departments were not legally obliged to take action \"whatever the cost\".</p> <p>A fuel poverty strategy was introduced under the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000 with the stated intention of doing everything \"reasonably practicable\" to end fuel poverty among vulnerable households in England and Wales by 2010, and in all households by 2016.</p> <p>Households in fuel poverty are defined as those in which more than 10% of income is spent on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/energy\">energy</a>. But far from the numbers falling, the past year has seen a steep increase as gas and electricity bills have rocketed.</p> <p>The latest official figures show that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/oct/02/householdbills.energy\">3.5 million households in the UK were in fuel poverty</a> in 2006, but that figure is though to have risen to around 5 million, and the charities argue that many of these people now face a stark choice of \"heat or eat\".</p> <p>At the hearing earlier this month the charities argued that the government was taking insufficient measures to meet their commitment and that the courts should intervene.</p> <p>But McCombe said the government had taken up the challenge to eliminate fuel poverty by specifying that it would try, so far as reasonably practicable, to achieve the targets.</p> <p>He added: \"In doing so, it imported a statutory duty to make those efforts. It did not assume a statutory duty to achieve the desired results, whatever the cost.\"</p> <p>Campaigners from the two groups said the ruling had exposed \"a huge loophole\" and they would continue to put pressure on the government to revise its \"out of date\" fuel poverty strategy <br> Ed Matthew, head of UK climate at Friends of the Earth, said: \"The high court's decision reveals a huge loophole in the legal protection for people in fuel poverty - big enough for millions of households to fall through. \"The government may have escaped legal reprimand, but it's not off the hook - it still faces the judgment of the 5 million UK households suffering in fuel poverty today.\" </p> <p>Mervyn Kohler, special adviser for Help the Aged, said the government was still obliged to end fuel poverty \"both legally and morally\".<br> He called for crisis payments to be made to low-income families to help them get through the coming winter. </p> <p>\"Although the government has been given a technical let-off, it cannot sit by while the number of people in fuel poverty escalates out of control,\" he said.</p> <p>\"In times of crisis, people look to the government for help - it must throw them a lifeline instead of allowing them to sink further into despair and anxiety. The intention of parliament to end fuel poverty was very clear in legislation - suffering must not be allowed to continue.\"</p> <p>The judge gave Friends of the Earth and Help the Aged permission to take their case to the court of appeal.</p> <p>He also ruled they would not have to meet the government's legal costs because they had brought the case in the public interest.</p>",
  "<p>It's not often that you hear a minister admitting that their government has put respect for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/humanrights\">human rights</a> \"on the back burner\", but that's exactly what <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/lawreports/joshuarozenberg/3236769/Making-people-love-human-rights.html\">Jack Straw did this week</a> .</p> <p>To be fair this admission was, as would be expected from the justice minister, firmly ensconced in a torrent of self-congratulation about Labour's deep-felt commitment to human rights. Straw even used the \"s\" word, proclaiming his fear that if further action is not taken soon, \"the foundation in people's souls for human rights will not be as deep or strong as I would wish\".</p> <p>The issue so threatening our souls is, apparently, the lack of a bill of rights in the UK. There is of course, already a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_Rights_1689\">bill of rights dating from 1689</a>, but that document is concerned with the rights of parliament as opposed to the crown, rather than the \"human rights\" which have become such a feature of the legal landscape in Europe since the second world war .</p> <p>Human rights are now part of UK law through <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/ukpga_19980042_en_1\">the human rights act</a>, which was introduced in 1998 giving courts the obligation to deliver judgments that are compatible with the European convention on human rights. Since then rights such as the right to a private and family life have been used by litigants ranging from the elderly demanding better treatment by care homes or the NHS, to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/20/mosley-privacy\">Max Mosley</a> claiming that he should be protected from media intrusion should he choose to conduct sex sessions with dominatrices.</p> <p>A new bill of rights, Straw says, would \"build\" on the human rights act, adding new rights and introducing responsibilities, requiring the benefit of rights to be \"matched by a culture of duty\". </p> <p>There are several reasons to question this brave new world of rights and responsibilities. It is interesting timing, to say the least, just over a week after the government suffered a resounding defeat to its proposals for 42-day detention without charge, one of the main objections to which was that it would inevitably violate convention rights to liberty and due process. </p> <p>The director of public prosecutions, who has watched more than five years of high-profile terrorism trials, suggested this week that the government had lost its cool in response to the threat of terrorism and that more than simply breaching the human rights act, was at risk of eroding the ancient civil liberties that lie at the heart of the British constitution. There are plenty of other provisions remaining in the new counter-terrorism bill that give good ground for scepticism as to the government's commitment to human rights; including procedures for freezing suspects' assets (including the cash in their pocket and gifts of food from friends) without any form of trial, and post-charge questioning, which gives the police unprecedented access to defendants whilst the trial process is already underway, potentially in breach of the right to a fair trial.</p> <p>Second, the idea that the new bill of rights would make rights conditional upon responsibilities is misleading. Despite the best efforts of some quarters of the press to suggest that the main achievement of the human rights act has been to give prisoners a licence to demand luxuries ranging from fast food to avoiding slopping out duties, rights have always been tied to conditions. There wouldn't be any prisoners, for example, if the right to liberty wasn't qualified by the ability of the state to detain people for a whole range of valid reasons. </p> <p>Some rights, on the other hand, can't be taken away for any reason under the current law; the prohibition of torture and of slavery. Presumably no government, even Cameron's (which continues to proclaim its determination to repeal the human rights act) is suggesting that torture and/or slavery be permitted if people behave irresponsibly. Which prompts the question, if the new bill of rights won't remove the basic rights people currently enjoy by tying them to \"responsible behaviour\", what would it actually add?</p> <p>Symbolism, says Straw. Not all the rights in the new bill will be justiciable \u2013 which means that they won't necessarily be legally enforced, but they will make people feel better. \"Rights can have great symbolic and totemic importance\", he said and should be \"a combination of law, symbolism and aspiration\".</p> <p>Which is all well and good, but maybe the government would do better to take stock of the symbolism already freely flowing from its chequered record on human rights. Despite claiming a moral platitude, with which we comfortably condemn the poor human rights records of other countries, we continue to deport people to countries where we know they are at risk of torture in return for diplomatic assurances, the validity of which the House of Lords is considering today. We already detain terrorist suspects for significantly longer than other comparable democracies, and would have extended this to 42 days, were it not for the actions of our supposedly unrepresentative second chamber, the House of Lords. We subject terrorist suspects to control orders essentially amounting to house arrest, despite lacking sufficient evidence to have them tried before a jury.</p> <p>Terrorist suspects are never going to be the best selling point for human rights, however. It's all about re-balancing the system in favour of the rights of victims and responsible members of society, the government tells us. But there too, is some powerful symbolism, and not necessarily of the type Straw has in mind. Victims of violent crime including rape and sexual abuse as children are routinely having their claims for compensation dismissed for reasons ranging from alcohol consumption (does this count as failing to live up to your responsibilities?), to alleged \"consent\".</p> <p>And last but by no means least, the main reason for this bill of rights and responsibilities, Straw tells us, is because of the increasing diversity of our society. Society today looks very different from the Britain the drafters of the European convention on human rights had in mind in the late 1940s, when minorities were, well \u2013 more minor \u2013 and the predominant threat was the resurgence of facism. But it is far from clear why the inclusion of minority groups in British society automatically amounts to a declining acceptance of responsibilities and shared values.</p> <p>It's heartening to know that Jack Straw is interested in what's going on in our souls but maybe he needs to look a little harder before pronouncing so confidently on what he sees.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Kramnik-Anand, World Championship 2008, game 5, after 28...Rc3. White to move. Can you do better than a world champion?</strong></p> <p>Play through the entire game at <a href=\"http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1510508\"> chessgames.com </a></p> <p><strong>RB</strong> If I were White here I'd be reasonably satisfied. I have to keep an eye on the d-pawn and be aware of threats along the semi-open g-file, especially with the enemy bishop on b7. But my two connected passed pawns on the queenside are potentially promising and the bishop on b5 is well placed. If the black rook moves off the c-file, my rook can go to c1 and then invade the seventh rank. There's also the possible tactic of 29 Nxd4. The knight is immune because after 29...Qxd4 White has 30 Rd1, with a double attack on the knight at d7, when the rook breaks on to the seventh rank. Let's just double-check before we commit. Ah, Black has 30...Nf6, which throws that little tactic into touch. Time to come up with something else.</p> <p><strong>DK</strong> In fact, Kramnik saw one step ahead of Ronan and after 30...Nf6 continued 31 Rxd4 Nxg4 32 Rd7+ Kf6 33 Rxb7, regaining the piece. However, Anand had seen even deeper and played 33...Rc1+ 34 Bf1 Ne3 35 fxe3 fxe3, and Kramnik resigned as he was unable to prevent the e-pawn advancing to the queening square. Starting with 29 Nxd4 this variation is around 14 moves deep, but it is all forced and Kramnik should have been able to calculate through to the finish.</p> <p>What should White play instead? Black threatens to capture with the bishop on f3 doubling the pawns, so the knight should move. 29 Ng5 is outlandish and 29...Ne5 looks a good reply. I prefer 29 Nd2, keeping an eye on Black's advanced d-pawn, but the pawn should advance anyway: 29...d3, opening the queen's path to d4. Ronan says he likes White's two connected passed pawns on the queenside, but at the moment they have little value. To my eyes, the dominant factors in the position are Black's central control and his well-coordinated pieces. By contrast, White's army looks split in two. In many variations the d-pawn can be dangerous and White's king is boxed in.</p> <p>With the score at 4.5-1.5 in his favour at the halfway stage, Anand's match strategy of heading for complex positions is paying off. Kramnik is running short of time calculating and the result is errors such as this.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:chess@theguardian.com\">chess@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Matthew Weaver </p> <p>Several more local authorities are expected to ban speed cameras over the next year, following the lead of Swindon council, which announced it was scrapping them last night.</p> <p>To the alarm of road safety campaigners, Swindon became the first council in the UK to scrap fixed speed cameras over concerns that the government is using them to raise money.</p> <p>The nine-member cabinet of the Tory council voted unanimously in favour of withdrawing from the partnership that operates local safety cameras.</p> <p>The AA motorists' group predicted other councils would use a recent relaxation in transport funding rules to ditch speed cameras in favour of other traffic calming measures. Councils in Portsmouth and North Somerset are known to be considering it.</p> <p>Andrew Howard, the AA's head of road safety, said: \"Other councils will now know they won't be the first, which will make life easier for them if they are thinking about it.\"</p> <p>Asked how many others would follow, he said: \"It's horribly difficult to say, but I would say six or seven.\"</p> <p>Howard welcomed Swindon's decision. \"We are very glad to see there's flexibility in the system and that road safety grant is not only camera money. Cameras are not the only way to skin the road safety problem.\"</p> <p>Brake, the national road safety charity, said it was \"appalled\" at what it called a \"reckless decision\".</p> <p>Its spokeswoman, Jane Whitham, said: \"Swindon Borough Council is entering into a very dangerous experiment with people's lives. Staying well within speed limits is essential for everyone's safety and speed cameras are an important tool in catching drivers who insist on breaking the law and putting lives in danger.\"</p> <p>The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents said today they would be \"monitoring the results\" in Swindon.</p> <p>\"Speed cameras have been shown to reduce casualties,\" said a royal society spokesman.</p> <p>Ditching cameras was championed by Peter Greenhalgh, Swindon's highways councillor, as a way of improving road safety. </p> <p>\"I have never said that speed cameras don't work \u2014 of course they do,\" he told the Swindon Advertiser. \"They are effective in stopping people speeding in a particular spot but they are not effective in stopping people being killed or seriously injured on our roads.\"<br> Greenhalgh's initiative was praised by the Top Gear presenter and pro-motorist columnist Jeremy Clarkson.</p> <p>But Greenhalgh said: \"I did not become a councillor to be hailed as a hero on Top Gear.\" </p> <p>He said police would still use handheld speed cameras in the town and alternative speed-reducing measures were being considered by the council, including education and training for motorists and reduced speed limits in problem areas.</p> <p>David Ainsworth, Wiltshire's deputy chief constable, said police were urging the council to consult them before they \"physically remove any camera\".</p> <p>Swindon MP Anne Snelgrove said: \"I am on the side of Wiltshire police in this debate \u2014 they know more about road safety than Swindon's Conservative councillors.\"</p> <p>Swindon council leader Rod Bluh said: \"Politics is about making policies and it is also about challenging policies if you do not believe they are working. If you think the status quo isn't working then you need to challenge that, however difficult that challenge is.\" </p> <p>Bluh admitted once being banned from driving for speeding. \"I was caught three or four years ago. But I'm a reformed character. I have not speeded since.\"</p> <p>The Department for Transport denied the government was using cameras to raise funds. \"Safety cameras are there to save lives, not make money. To ensure that local partnerships have no incentive to try to raise money from cameras, fines are paid into a central fund rather than directly to those partnerships,\" a spokesman said.</p>",
  "<p>Oh no. If the country wasn't facing enough problems, what with the recession and George Osborne's colourful holidays with Peter Mandelson, the government has chosen today to reform sex education for the tiny tots. It's surely on a hiding to nothing there, I'd wager.</p> <p>Before schools minister Jim Knight unveiled today's details of what he and his capo Ed Balls have in mind, he had already hinted - last week - that a review his department set up had received \"strong recommendations\" for making sex education compulsory in all schools. But it must be done without \"sexualising young people too early\", the minister emphasised.<br><br>In a society as sexualised as ours that's going to be pretty difficult. Ever vigilant, I spotted we were getting confused years ago when Pirelli introduced that calendar with models posing on it in a supposedly sexy way. Car tyres? Car tyres and sex? Sex used to sell car tyres? Had I missed something during the primitive version of sex ed taught in my Cornish grammar school?</p> <p>Anyway, it's got a lot worse than Pirelli. Sexuality, and what passes for it, seems to have seeped into all corners of our lives, together with anxiety about sexuality. Am I too fat? Unlovable? Not sexually active enough for a woman of 83 (or 12)? And why is little Amy sitting on Uncle Arthur's knee eating sweeties? </p> <p>So what should governments do about it? It's certainly not Gordon Brown's job to give us the basic facts of life in a nightly ministerial broadcast, entertainingly oblique though the Broon version might be (\"Not too much boom and bust children, it may distract you from your studies\"). </p> <p>But clearly, in this age of anxiety, the teaching profession requires guidance. When so many parents are irresponsible, neurotic, busy, overprotective, angry, negligent, it must be a minefield for every head and staff.</p> <p>As things stand current rules provide that schoolchildren must be taught the biological facts of reproduction. This usually happens in science classes - in those new-fangled biology classes we had back in 1960, as I recall. Our teacher, Miss Bland, was prone to blushing (so was I) and it was painful. \"My last job was in pest control. It was easier,\" I still recall her saying.</p> <p>But just as every school must have a sex-education policy, there is no statutory requirement for teaching about relationships and the social and emotional side of sexual behaviour. This is the bit Knight hopes to change. </p> <p>There's also a separate report out suggesting better education on drugs and drink. But let's stick to sex and seven-year-olds. As I understand it, they will be told the birds and bees stuff, but not told the rude mechanics of sexual intercourse - which always sounds gross, threatening or screamingly funny (\"You do what with it?\") to anyone not actively engaged in the deed. </p> <p>Kids will only get the details at 11-plus, though girls will be told about periods before they get them - often at 10 nowadays, I'm told. That sounds fair enough. It used to come as a terrible shock to girls not prepared for it, well into my lifetime.</p> <p>Needless to say, partisans on both sides have already been touring the broadcast studios explaining:</p> <p>(a) why international studies suggest that such an informative approach is helpful to young people, especially before puberty.</p> <p>(b) why premature sexualisation of children, the \"safe sex\" doctrine etc have a pretty bad record in Britain, which is still EU champion in the teen pregnancy and sexually-transmitted disease stakes.</p> <p>Needless to say again, both sides have a point. Stories of young girls bullied into it by boys, but thinking they can avoid getting pregnant via all the old wives' tales (young wives too) are heart-breaking. But so are the 10-year-old Lolitas one cannot help but spot in any of our city centres dressed up as if they were on the game. </p> <p>The media message that sex is the answer to whatever the question is (\"What brand of tyre should Daddy buy?\") reinforces society's complicity in this pernicious stuff on countless magazine covers, billboards and TV shows. I swear it, even the gardening programmes show a bit of ankle nowadays. Is nothing sacred, not even next spring's daffs?</p> <p>Having watched my own children and their friends grow up, my own impression is that it's best to install the basics when they're still too young to be very interested, let alone embarrassed. As I recall, Mrs White, who is terrific at this sort of thing, had an illustrated book in which a bearded Dane tackled Mrs Dane in a rather earnest way. It caused much merriment.</p> <p>The trouble is that most kids know at least as much as the teachers by the time they're 12, or think they do. In some cases (Miss Bland?) they're probably right, in others, the ones that reach court, it turns out that teacher has been giving free lessons after school. Sheer self-sacrifice!</p> <p>But Knight is surely right to stress relationships and, I hope, to emphasise mutual respect, the key to it all at 12 or 112. When I was still bookish and virginal, dimly aware it was the 60s, but hopeless at doing anything about it, I clocked a line of Iris Murdoch's that \"the essence of love is the toleration of difference\". It holds up better than the Pirelli calendar of the same year.</p> <p>My first real girlfriend's next boyfriend got her pregnant, so I heard, enviously - though it was a narrow escape. As parents we later found ourselves more permissive than either of us expected about all the usual stuff. It worked out more or less all right, but these matters are always a mixture of luck and judgment.</p> <p>It's hard to avoid the very obvious conclusion: a good example at home is the safest way to inculcate better habits into children; school, which so often gets the blame, can only do so much to correct family failings. </p> <p>So good luck, Jim Knight, but don't expect any gratitude.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2008/apr/14/poker\">A few months ago</a>, I wrote about a world-class fold of trip threes that Marcel Luske (\"the Flying Dutchman\") made against the young German, Ben Kang. It was a situation in which a weak player would raise, a good player would call, but only a wizard could pass. This play was broadcast in this week's heat of the PartyPoker Poker Nations Cup (Tuesday nights, Channel 4) and you can see the video <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2008/oct/22/poker-nations-cup\">here</a> at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/poker\">theguardian.com/sport/poker</a>. Have a look: it is magical poker.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2008/oct/22/poker-nations-cup\">next hand</a> reminds me of what we have been discussing here more recently, about value bets on the river.</p> <p>William Thorson raises to 225 (blinds 50-100) with Kc 10d, and Luske calls from the small blind with As Qh. Marcel checks a flop of Ad Qd 7d, presumably planning a check-raise, but Thorson doesn't fall for it and checks behind. The turn is 3d. Luske now bets 200, and Thorson minimum-raises to 400 with the flush. Luske must call.</p> <p>The river is 10c. Luske checks, and Thorsson bets 475. Many players (fearing Jd, or even a check-raise from Kd) would be relieved to just turn Thorson's hand over. But he wrings value from the situation by betting a third of the pot, hoping for a heroic call from a small diamond or a hand just like Luske's. Luske is too good (or too chip-depleted) to make the call. But Thorsson would often get paid in this spot, and it's an example of what I meant when I said, \"Value-betting the river with a vulnerable but winning hand is one of the most sophisticated moves in poker.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.victoriacoren.com/\">victoriacoren.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The West Bank version of the adage \"<a href=\"http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/2279.html\">Give a man a fish</a> \u2026\" appears to have been remodelled along far more sinister lines of late. Instead, the prevalent attitude is to not only snatch the lion's share for the benefit of the settlers, but also to <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/West-Bank-Olive-Harvest-Disrupted-By-Jewish-Settlers-Who-Target-Palestinian-Farmers/Article/200810315124770?lpos=World_News_News_Your_Way_Region_4&amp;lid=NewsYourWay_ARTICLE_15124770_West_Bank_Olive_Harvest_Disrupted_By_Jewish_Settlers_Who_Target_Palestinian_Farmers\">kick the Palestinians</a> while they're down on their knees scrabbling to glean whatever morsels they can from what's left. </p> <p>The olive harvest is in <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1222017576844&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull\">full swing</a> at the moment; so too are the settlers' clubs and the soldiers' batons, as they do their level best to impede the farmers' attempts to harvest their meagre crops the length and breadth of the Occupied Territories. I went to the tiny hamlet of Izzmut this week, unhappily situated alongside the settlement of Elon Moreh, from whose borders emanate almost daily attacks by settlers hell bent on disrupting the proceedings. </p> <p>\"They come to attack us all the time,\" a landowner named Saed told me. \"The other day they beat an old man who was working with his wife, resulting in his hand being broken. We have 200 olive trees on the other side of their settlement, yet we can't go near them; if we do, both the settlers and soldiers shoot at us, so we don't even try to approach any more.\" </p> <p>He described how the situation has worsened with every passing year, and held little hope for the future of his village. \"There is nothing to discuss with the settlers,\" he explained flatly, \"since they want us out of here, full stop.\" He spoke of the frustration felt by the villagers and their children, whose safety was entirely at the mercy of largely-uncaring Israeli troops. \"If the army do come when we call for help, they always come too late,\" he said; the attackers are never brought to justice, leaving the locals little option but to defend themselves as best they can \"with sticks and stones\". </p> <p>A conservative estimate by the IDF put at 20 the number of <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1222017593631&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull\">violent clashes</a> between settlers and farmers during the latest harvest. While the true number is reported to be far higher, one settler I met on the road to Nablus claimed that most settlers have nothing but love for their fellow man \u2013 be they Jews, Palestinians or anyone else. </p> <p>\"In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/08/feiglinsutopia\">Karnei Shomron</a> [where I live], we have excellent relations with our Palestinian neighbours,\" he assured me, blaming all settler violence on a handful of extremists. He told me that, for his part, he got on famously with his Palestinian employees, though he was quick to assert that were any West Bank land to be handed over to the Palestinian Authority, \"all of Israel would be in danger\". </p> <p>He defended his decision to live in such a contentious area by pointing to the high level of schooling his children received, and the \"lack of drug problems\" that apparently dog Israeli cities on the right side of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967_borders\">Green Line</a>. I put it to him that his self-centred desire to give his children the best education meant effectively destroying the Palestinian society all around his settlement, thanks to the crippling network of checkpoints, Israeli-only roads and army bases that each settler community necessitated. He replied simply, and obliquely, that security measures were essential to prevent terror attacks on Jews, believing \"the hate between Israelis and Arabs will never end\". </p> <p>Driving towards Nablus, it was clear that the measures taken by the army just to protect a handful of settlements will ensure that Palestinian resentment towards Israel continues unabated for years to come. Approaching the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A18597-2004Nov28?language=printer\">Huwara checkpoint</a>, hundreds of Palestinians were crushed like battery hens into metal pens, as indifferent-looking soldiers let them through the bottleneck turnstiles at a snail's pace. Nablus, one of the economic hubs of the West Bank, has been effectively sealed off from the rest of the region, thanks to the \"necklace of settlements draped around it\", <a href=\"http://www.careinternational.org.uk/11702/media-releases/middle-east-quartet-is-failing-warn-aid-agencies.html\">according</a> to Care International's policy adviser, with whom I was travelling.</p> <p>The story was no different for the scores of smaller towns we passed during our journey, including Izzmut itself, which is almost entirely encircled by settler-only roads, with earth mounds and metal gates barring Palestinians from driving up even their own dirt tracks. Compounding the ignominy of having been corralled into such prison-like surroundings, the abuse suffered during the utterly benign and inoffensive act of harvesting their olives only rubs salt into the locals' wounds. </p> <p>In the circumstances, it is amazing that fewer Palestinians take up arms to resist the incessant assaults on them and their property. Bereft of adequate protection by the the IDF \u2013 the only security force allowed to operate in the area \u2013 and unable to fend off the wave after wave of settler attacks, that more Palestinians don't take the law into their own hands is down simply to good fortune as far as ordinary Israelis are concerned. </p> <p>The settlers aren't stupid; they know that their relentless provocation will eventually push the Palestinians too far, and that once a retaliatory attack occurs, it will give the army carte blanche to clamp down even harder on the Palestinians, and turn even more of a blind eye to the expansion of Israeli settlements. In the meantime, on the other side of Elon Moreh, the olive branches sag under the weight of their unpicked fruit, and the longer their owners are prevented from gathering in their crops, the further recede any chances of peaceful resolution to a never-ending war.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/alqaida\">Al-Qaida</a>'s had its chips. In Iraq, Sunni Muslims, the very people the group says it fights for, kicked its fighters out of their neighbourhoods. And here, in Britain, al-Qaida has notched up an impressive list of failures. The only place Osama Bin Laden's fighters have a serious presence is Pakistan's tribal areas and Afghanistan. But even there, locals unhappy about the presence of foreign troops do most of the fighting.</p> <p>If we believe this, a good chunk of taxpayers' money has been well spent. In August, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/26/alqaida.uksecurity\">the Guardian reported</a> a counter-terrorism unit set up by the government had been trying to persuade media organisations to tell everyone that al-Qaida was losing support. </p> <p>Now that we know the government was trying to sell us a line, you have to wonder whether recent reporting on the demise of al-Qaida's brand of extremism succumbed to the persuasive power of spin doctoring. Is it really safe to turn our concern towards the credit crunch?</p> <p>There is now a general feeling among analysts and journalists that al-Qaida has come under pressure from former jihadists and respected Islamic theologians who condemn suicide bombings and the killing of civilians. But the basis of this conclusion is faulty for a number of reasons. </p> <p>Much of the comment on the Islamic ideological backlash against al-Qaida is based upon a treatise written by Sayyid Imam al-Sharif aka Dr Fadl from his prison cell in Egypt. Sharif's work has been hailed as devastating to extremist thinking because he was once the head of an Egyptian terrorist organisation that later joined with al-Qaida. He also wrote a book called the \"jihadist Bible\". (Shouldn't that be \"jihadist Quran?\") However, as his former deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri pointed out in an internet posting: is the power cord of Sherif's computer the same one they use for the torture equipment? Which is about the level of credence and time any serious radical I've spoken to gives it. </p> <p>I spent months with a group of radical (but not violent) young British Muslims earlier this year, at about the same time word first started leaking about Sharif's \"new\" views. The reaction in the study circles of Walthamstow and Luton was: \"And what?\"</p> <p>Not only was the credibility of Sharif's position tainted by the fact he was publishing it from prison, but with a little extra digging it doesn't even seem as if his views were all that new in any case. </p> <p>The pan-Arabic daily newspaper al-Hayat quoted Sharif's son in a 2004 article saying his father had fallen out with Zawahiri over the use of violence as early as 1992. Other sources say Sharif has already printed the views he repeats from the Egyptian prison in a book he had published in London in the early 1990s. The seriously ideologically inspired violent extremists that the analysts thought would be swayed by Sharif's arguments already know this. </p> <p>Also, pinning so much hope on theology to take the wind out of al-Qaida's sails ignores the situation on the ground. Al-Qaida's audience has changed, and is continuing to change. </p> <p>In the 1990s, when I was a teenager, you could get yourself to a training camp in Afghanistan from my local mosque. A good couple of my friends thought it would be a great laugh to run around doing target practice but that they'd have to figure out a way of avoiding the religion stuff. The only people into the \"religion stuff\" were seriously dull, as far as we were concerned. The people who could get you into Afghanistan were accessible, but only the most ideologically zealous, or dense, would want to go.</p> <p>Today, the facilitators are not accessible, but the idea has a whole new cachet of cool. Al-Qaida's image has gained credibility on the country's inner-city streets that wasn't there before 2001. </p> <p>While researching a <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/dispatches/from+jail+to+jihad/2288772\">Dispatches documentary</a> earlier this year, I met vigilantes who had adopted al-Qaida's twisted version of Islam and twisted it even further to justify violent robbery. They raided drug dealers and off licences while going to war with other gangs because, as they said, \"we enjoin the good and forbid the evil\". When I asked them how they saw al-Qaida, the responses were: \"tough, disciplined, principled\" and, my favourite description, \"shadow warriors\". </p> <p>These young men, several of whom had converted to Islam, didn't care about the ideology of faraway sheikhs. The violence was the attraction.</p> <p>If the question is: \"Yes, but are narcissistic criminals actually going to join al-Qaida's global jihad?\" The answer is, it's already happened. For the documentary, I interviewed one young man who had gone from a life of crime and gangs to a training camp in this country. Also, increasing numbers of those arrested in recent terror cases have histories of drug abuse and criminality.</p> <p>Something similar is happening abroad too. In Ain Al Helwe, a Palestinian camp in Lebanon, I saw young al-Qaida fighters returning from Iraq brimming with confidence after taking on American troops. It wasn't difficult to see the fear and awe they aroused among the middle-aged men with decrepit AK47s and tatty uniforms who represented defunct secular Palestinian organisations. </p> <p>Challenging ideology does help. I have met people who have become convinced that violence is not the Islamic way to direct their anger. But there's a growing pool of people who don't care about the intricacies of Islamic ideology. They want to fight because violence for a cause enriches their sense of self. </p> <p>Solving tomorrow's extremism problem, instead of yesterday's, requires dealing with more fundamental issues than playing with perceptions of religion. The longer the delay, the more extremism is going to spread into criminality, gun crime and gang culture. As that process continues, the treatment will become more costly. But as we've learnt from the government's treatment for the credit crunch, you get what you pay for.</p>",

By day, the banter in McCarthy's is dominated by the conundrums of the dairy industry and the cryptic world of horse racing. The pub is the spiritual home of the Coolmore Stud, the most successful thoroughbred stud in the world. McCarthy's possesses a dark and inviting interior, its tobacco-stained walls smothered by images of men clutching trophies, well-toned horses in mid-flight, revolutionaries at play, the Bloody Sunday football team. Rattan stools wait along a counter of solid oak that runs the length of the right-hand wall, broken midway by an arch. McCarthy's has a catchphrase: \"We wine you, dine you and bury you.\" Sure enough, the pub offers both an upmarket restaurant and an acclaimed undertaker service.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Main Street, Fethard, Co Tipperary, +353 52 31149, <a href=\"http://mccarthyshotel.net/\">mccarthyshotel.net</a></p> <h2>2.

The pub is effectively a large wooden cavern, softly lit by lamps that hang from a ceiling held up by metal beams. The room is loosely carved into a warren of snugs and seating areas by dint of wooden partitions and stand-alone walls seemingly crafted from old biscuit tin lids and dismantled clocks. The legendary charm of Morrissey's undoubtedly hails from the incredible collection of old-world goods on display on its dark shelf-lined walls. These shelves are packed with the sort of products that would have abounded in a village grocery half a century ago: huge jars of sweets, an old slicing machine, Boyne Valley cornflakes and Morrissey's own Famous Tea, right beside the scales on which the packs were weighed.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Main Street, Abbeyleix, Co Laois, +353 57 873 1281</p> <h2> 3.

As such, he and his wife Breda have done much to bring the pub back to its original Edwardian state. Clancy's is considered one of the great music pubs of eastern Ireland. Every Thursday night, somewhere between 12 and 15 musicians now congregate here. They play fiddles, bodhr\u00e1ns, flutes and mandolins, and sing songs about long-gone tyrants, rising moons and rose-peppered valleys. The tobacco-stained walls are pasted with scores from songbooks, classical and traditional. The audience sways upon scruffy benches and assorted chairs, tapping their heels on the wide-plank floor and allowing their voices to join in with the repetition of each rousing chorus.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 12 Leinster St, Athy Co, Kildare .</p> <h2>4.

It helps, of course, that the pub is located on one of the busiest streets in a city that is alive all year round with a commotion of students, visitors and citizens alike, the atmosphere kept sharp by the music ringing on the Atlantic breeze.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 17 Cross Street, Galway, +353 91 568820</p> <h2>5.

Timber and glass partitions allow light to flood in while ensuring the spaces remain enclosed and private. The long bar counter rolls up past the snugs and main bar area, curling towards a pot-bellied Romesse stove at the far end.

The mandolin criss-crossed Ireland with Paddy Keenan and the Bothy Band. The fender jazz bass guitar belonged to the late Noel Redding, the former Jimi Hendrix bassist and celebrated resident of Clonakilty. Wherever possible, owners Bobby and Eileen have left the original pub interior intact, including the bar, complete with snug. A dark wooden corridor lined with photographs and posters leads to the purpose-built auditorium where the de Barra Folk Club congregates. And if the bar staff appear to be particularly interested in the tunes, that's because they are all gifted musicians in their own right. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 55 Pearse St, Clonakilty, West Cork, +353 23 33381, <a href=\"http://www.debarra.ie/\">debarra.ie</a></p> <h2>7.

Two special malt barrels he purchased from Edmunds of Dublin in 1912 rest above the bar to this day. Among Annie's intriguing customers are the miscellaneous artists, writers, musicians and other oddities attending nearby <a href=\"http://www.tyroneguthrie.ie/\">Annaghmakerrig</a>, the retreat set up by late theatre director Sir Tyrone Guthrie.

Michael has done much to ensure his pub remains an aesthetic delight. An overhead shelf runs around the room, groaning under the weight of tobacco-stained footballs, whiskey jars, tumblers, brass lamps, ash plane canes and fishing nets. Cheerful green leather stools assemble along the Colombian pine bar and miscellaneous oddities hang from the ceiling.

Nearly 300 years after it was founded, Kelly's manages to find its feet somewhere between everyman drinking pub, political meeting place and historic museum. Folk music is a regular fare at weekends. As the pints and shorts slide across the bar, so the session players gather momentum by a roaring turf fire, a riot of button accordions, banjos, bodhr\u00e1ns, tin whistles, concertinas, flutes and fiddles. Between the reels, the Irish language is heard throughout the bar, used by staff and customers alike.

  "<p>A suspected <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa\">US</a> air strike killed nine people at a religious school in north-west <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan\">Pakistan</a>, intelligence officials said today.</p> <p>It was claimed the school, on the outskirts of Miran Shah, the main town in the North Waziristan region, had links to the Taliban.</p> <p>Four of those killed in the attack were found in the rubble of the school. Two others were injured.</p> <p>The attack is being seen as a sign of US frustration at Pakistan's approach to counter-terrorism.</p> <p>It came within hours of Pakistan's parliament warning against any incursions on Pakistani soil. MPs called for a review of national security, making talks with militants the top priority. </p> <p>Unnamed intelligence officials told the Associated Press that the religious school belonged to a local pro-Taliban cleric who had been linked to the veteran Taliban commander Jalaluddin Haqqani, considered a top target of the US. </p> <p>Militants in the north-west are blamed for rising attacks on US and Nato forces in neighbouring Afghanistan, as well as suicide attacks within Pakistan.</p> <p>Cross-border US missile attacks have angered Pakistan, which sees them as a violation of its sovereignty.</p> <p>Yesterday's parliamentary resolution on security had few details, apparently a result of political compromise after two weeks of debate.</p> <p>It did not directly mention two of the most divisive issues surrounding the terror fight: army offensives in the north-west and calls for unconditional talks with the extremists.</p> <p>The major opposition parties recognise the need for military action against the insurgents, but rarely express it forcefully because they want to maintain support among ordinary Pakistanis who are deeply suspicious of the war.</p> <p>The seven-month-old government hailed the 14-point document as a \"historic moment for the country\". The information minister, Sherry Rehman, said: \"This will definitely help to improve the situation and to rid the country of the menace of terrorism.\"</p> <p>The resolution calls for an \"independent foreign policy\", a sign of wariness of American influence.</p> <p>It states Pakistan will not let its soil be used for terrorist attacks elsewhere \u2014 an apparent acknowledgment of US complaints about militants hiding in north-west Pakistan.</p> <p>The resolution alludes to the US missile attacks, stating that Pakistan \"stands united against any incursions and invasions of the homeland, and calls upon the government to deal with it effectively\".</p> <p>While saying dialogue \"must now be the highest priority,\" it stipulates that talks should be pursued with those elements willing to follow the constitution and the rule of law.</p> <p>Pakistan is in the midst of an economic crisis brought about by high fuel prices, dwindling foreign investment, soaring inflation and militant violence.</p> <p>The government has formally requested financial help from the International Monetary Fund to avoid a possible loan default, a decision that could cost the administration political support at home.</p>",
  "<p>\"I felt like I was stumbling, groping around in the dark. Didn't know where I was going in the next paragraph; didn't know what I was doing in the next chapter. But I somehow found my way.\"</p> <p>Speaking softly and slowly, with the slightest Deep South twang, James Sallis is on the line from Phoenix to discuss his new novel, Salt River. It's the shortest of his increasingly slim tales to date, but took the longest to write. Sallis says he's relying more on improvisation and abandoning \"the certainties with which I began writing\" but external forces also held up the novel: \"An 11-pound tumor was removed from my abdomen. My wife Karyn and I named it Gertrude. One of my writing students offered to knit a little hat and booties for it.\"</p> <p>As Sallis recalls this struggle for direction, he sounds like his lost-as-hell antihero, Turner. He introduced the existential <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/crime\">detective</a> in Cypress Grove, where he fulfils a self-imposed exile in a one-horse town outside Memphis. A sequel, Cripple Creek, followed. Now Salt River completes the Turner trilogy: \"It never occurred to me, during its writing, that Cypress Grove would be anything other than an individual novel. But once I was done, I found myself wanting to know more about this man and his world.\"</p> <p>Sallis presents Turner as a man defined and haunted by what he no longer is: a soldier, a cop and a convict. Episodes from his former lives are scattered through the books as flashbacks. \"Turner is a man whose life has gone through abrupt changes,\" Sallis explains. \"I felt that the novels' structures should reflect the seeming discontinuities of his life.\" It's a technique that is at odds with the thumbnail sketches favoured by crime writers intent on establishing a novel's cast quickly before cracking on with the plot. Turner himself is the mystery instead.</p> <p>If he takes his time when it comes to characterisation \u2013 we don't learn Turner's first name until midway through the second book \u2013 Sallis also has a laidback approach to story. The barely-there storylines in Salt River almost evaporate on the page. You don't get lost in his plots, they tend to lose themselves. \"Plots are a contrivance \u2013 our lives are plotless \u2013 yet they're necessary, I think, to literary form,\" explains Sallis. \"My way of dealing with this has been to move the plot offstage a bit, to write around it.\" Is this why, when I think of Sallis's books, I'm hit by smells of home-brewed coffee and wild magnolia rather than anything that actually happened? \"Those are the parts of the world that we own, what comes back to us about times in our own lives when we think of the past,\" he insists. \"All too often I'm reading this great book with a solid setting, characters that walk right into my own life, then somewhere around the fifth or sixth chapter the plot kicks in \u2013 and all that falls into the background. I want all that stuff, that surround, to remain in the foreground.\"</p> <p>He does that \"surround\" very well, evoking the grit and wit of rural southern life with ease. (Sallis grew up in Helena, a small town on the banks of the Mississippi.) He has an ear for sleepy, porch-front wisdom, with his characters often swapping homilies to the sound of cicadae on long summer nights.</p> <p>\"My grandfather lived across the way from us,\" he tells me. \"I would hear him coming up to the house, reciting these long narrative poems he had learned as a schoolchild. I grew up hearing those, and you just absorb the rhythms of the story.\" Were there books in the house when he was young? \"We're from lower-class, southern stock,\" he says. \"My dad was fairly typical, hard-working, blue-collar \u2013 hunting on weekends, fixing lawnmowers \u2026 My brother and I developed this love for books. The first things I read were science fiction.\"</p> <p>So were the first things Sallis wrote. He began to sell stories to magazines then made a life-changing move to London in his early 20s to edit groundbreaking sci-fi magazine New Worlds with Michael Moorcock at the fag-end of the 60s. Working alongside Moorcock opened Sallis's eyes to hard-boiled crime fiction: \"Mike introduced me to books by Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett, which I had never found here in the States oddly enough.\" When Sallis began to write his own crime novels, critics distinguished him as a supposed rare breed \u2013 the \"literary crime writer\".</p> <p>Sallis finds the tag \"useless and foolish\" but his novels have an undeniable intellectualism that remains rare in the genre. Michael Connelly may well have named his detective after the Dutch painter Hieronymous Bosch, but Sallis goes a step or two further. His novel Long-Legged Fly, the first of a series starring the African-American detective Lew Griffin, takes its title from Yeats. His spy novel Death Will Have Your Eyes borrows lines by Italian poet Cesare Pavese. Sallis has a side career as a translator of works including Raymond Queneau's Saint Glinglin, a novel that unsurprisingly sidelines plot in favour of linguistic games.</p> <p>When it comes to crime fiction, Sallis knows his history. Traditional elements of the PI novel could be detected in the rain-lashed New Orleans streets trodden by Lew Griffin, a bourbon drinker with hate and hurt inside him. Sallis's standalone novel Drive practically distilled pulp fiction.</p> <p>The tale of a movie stunt driver who has criminal connections, it was dedicated to Ed McBain, Donald Westlake and Laurence Block and written with such noir stylists firmly in Sallis's rear-view mirror. The book will soon be a film with Hugh Jackman in the lead role.</p> <p>Several other side careers have informed Sallis's fiction. He was a respiratory therapist in critical care at county hospitals \u2013 \"the places where major trauma is brought, where street people and the poor come for medical attention, where babies found in dumpsters wind up.\" How has the experience shaped his novels? \"For those long 12-hour shifts, I was shoehorned forcibly out of my own head and my own petty concerns into a real life of people with real problems.\"</p> <p>Sallis is also a musician with a taste for blues, Appalachian ballads and Cajun waltzes. \"I write as I play music,\" he says, calling it \"improvisation wound round a core.\" He also finds time to teach literature, which may explain why he is at ease analysing the private business of writing. \"I tell my students that it's as though there's some vague shape or motion in the corner of the room. I catch it out of the corner of my eye, but when I look straight on, it's not there. Then as I write, it begins to take on form, to become more visible, more present. By the time I'm well into the book, I begin to hear it breathing over there.\"</p> <p>What's breathing at the moment? Sallis gives me the skinny on the next novel: \"The major characters are a contract killer who is dying of cancer, a 12-year-old whose parents have disappeared and who goes on living by himself in the family house, and a pair of detectives, with the point of view shifting among them chapter to chapter.\" Sounds, as ever, straightforward in synopsis, but Sallis muddies the waters: \"The killer's mark was attacked by someone else before he had a chance to strike, the detectives are working on this case of attempted murder, and the young man seems to be having the killer's dreams.\"</p> <p>Long-Legged Fly and Cypress Grove started out as standalones, so who knows if this will launch another series. As Sallis says: \"I never know I'm jumping in the river, I always think I'm just sticking my feet in.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Salt River is published on October 23 by No Exit Press</p>",
  "<p><strong>October 22 session</strong></p> <p><strong>Recession</strong></p> <p>The prime minister admitted the financial crisis was \"likely to cause recession\" in the UK. </p> <p>Gordon Brown announced new measures to help hard-pressed homeowners stave off repossession of their homes. </p> <p>The Tory leader, David Cameron, accused him of having \"racked up\" debt during the boom years and getting the stewardship of the economy \"wrong\". </p> <p>He repeatedly challenged the prime minister to admit that he had not, as he had previously claimed, abolished the \"boom and bust\" economic cycle. </p> <p>But Brown sidestepped the question and insisted it was \"right\" to stimulate economic activity by borrowing in a downturn. \"The reason we can afford to borrow is that we have low national debt,\" he told MPs. </p> <p><strong>Energy companies</strong></p> <p>Brown came under mounting pressure to force energy companies to pass on falling gas and oil prices to hard-pressed households. </p> <p>The prime minister said he was willing to look at any \"constructive suggestion\" for ways of helping families keep costs down. He added that he expected falling costs of oil and gas to be \"reflected over time\" in household bills. </p> <p><strong>Market turmoil</strong></p> <p>The government has been slow to react to the financial market turmoil causing the \"deepest imaginable pain\" to businesses throughout the country, Alan Duncan, the shadow business secretary, said. </p> <p>He told MPs there was \"growing anger\" at Brown for declaring he had abolished boom and bust while \"mortgaging this country in the way that bankers have mortgaged their banks\". </p> <p>Ian Pearson, the economic secretary to the Treasury, said in a statement that the government was \"determined to do everything it can\" to help small and medium-sized businesses. </p> <p>Lord Mandelson, the business secretary, making a statement to the Lords hours later, said: \"The importance of the issues I realise are of concern to the whole house and it is important that I should report personally to it. </p> <p>\"I am doing this as soon as the business of the house allows but it is not always easy to synchronise the timetables of business in this house and the Commons.\" </p> <p><strong>Merger</strong></p> <p>The legal obstacle to the merger between ailing bank HBOS and Lloyds TSB was removed. An order amending competition law to allow the deal to proceed was passed by 424 votes to 64, despite a last ditch attempt to block the deal by the SNP. </p> <p>It is now up to Mandelson to decide whether the merger goes ahead if it is approved by shareholders. </p> <p><strong>Oligarch</strong></p> <p>The prime minister, commenting on shadow chancellor George Osborne's dealings with a Russian oligarch, said: \"This is a very serious matter and I hope it is investigated by the authorities.\" </p> <p><strong>Aid worker</strong></p> <p>Brown paid tribute to a British aid worker gunned down by the Taliban in Afghanistan. He said the murder of Gayle Williams was a \"barbaric act\" and that her family should be \"extremely proud\" of the work she was doing to improve the lives of Afghans. </p> <p><strong>Tote</strong></p> <p>The government has shelved plans to sell state-owned bookmaker the Tote, Gerry Sutcliffe said. The sports minister added that market conditions were \"not appropriate\" to pursue a sale and the Tote would be retained in public ownership until they improved. </p> <p><strong>Ex-servicemen</strong></p> <p>The prime minister said that the government had a duty to help ex-servicemen adjust to civilian life as it was claimed veterans make up 10% of the prison population. He said a \"small minority\" of those leaving the armed forces had difficulty coping with life outside the military. </p> <p>Plaid Cymru's leader in Westminster, Elfyn Llwyd, urged Brown to raise the issue with justice and defence ministers so they can \"determine the extent of the problem\" and put in place measures \"to deal with returnees from conflict zones before they commit offences\". </p> <p>The prime minister told Llwyd: \"We are looking at this matter.\" </p> <p><strong>Footballers</strong></p> <p>Brown said England's footballers could play a key role in making the nation's youngsters realise the danger of carrying a knife. He said there needed to be a \"culture change\" in youths to make having a blade as unacceptable as racism on the soccer pitch. </p> <p><strong>Female voters</strong></p> <p>Cameron was mocked for hiring PR experts in a bid to woo female voters. He is reported to have hired marketing consultants Pretty Little Head to broaden his party's appeal to women. </p> <p>Brown said that Tories were \"interested in public relations\" but he was focusing on policy. </p> <p><strong>Abortion</strong></p> <p>MPs reacted angrily after \"shabby\" government tactics prevented a debate on abortion law reform. The timetable allowed only three and a half hours' discussion on amendments to the human fertilisation and embryology bill. New clauses relating to abortion law were never reached. </p> <p>Diane Abbott (Lab, Hackney North and Stoke Newington), leading a move to legalise abortion in Northern Ireland, protested: \"It seems to me that this programme motion and particularly the order of discussion is a shabby manoeuvre by ministers to stop full debate on some very important matters.\" </p> <p>Dawn Primarolo, the health minister, confirmed that the government had \"no plans\" to introduce a bill on abortion. </p> <p>The third reading was backed by 355 votes to 129. Ruth Kelly, the Labour former cabinet minister, was among 16 party rebels. </p> <p><strong>Congestion charge</strong></p> <p>Brown defended the way a referendum on whether motorists should be forced to pay to enter a city centre was being carried out. </p> <p>There has been angry reaction to the question Manchester residents will be asked because it makes no reference to the \"congestion charge\". </p> <p>Graham Stringer, the Labour former minister and MP for Manchester Blackley, urged Brown to scrap the \"divisive\" vote on the \"unfair\" scheme and instead invest in the city's trams. </p> <p>The prime minister insisted the question's wording had been \"approved legally\". </p> <p><strong>UK football team</strong></p> <p>Wayne David, the junior Wales minister, said Brown was \"keen\" on the UK having a football team in the 2012 Olympics \"but clearly there's some work to be done to reassure the Football Associations of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. But you can rest assured we will continue our dialogue in a positive way.\"</p>",

  "<p>For my work, I need to check websites for news and information regularly. And every time I travelled to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">mainland China</a>, I would often do the same, until I saw the blank page or time-out error message on the screen. Not being able to access some sites reminded me of where I was. Last month, when I was back in Hong Kong after a month spent in Beijing reporting the Olympic games, I found I automatically didn't visit those sites, and even when I did, I half-expected a blank screen to pop up.</p> <p>I believe many people who travel frequently to and from China have similar experiences. When I was stationed in Beijing for two years, I found the inability to access information freely often hindered my work. I felt helpless when my manager demanded to know why I hadn't reacted to certain news because, even if the news happened nearby, I had no way of knowing. My journalist colleagues shared the same burden. Eventually our HQ had to accept using material from foreign media to report domestic events in China.</p> <p>Many people in Hong Kong who complain about aspects of their daily lives would recognise that the country provides two fundamental things for ordinary people: security and freedom. People feel secure because they trust law and order and they feel free because information flows freely here.</p> <p>So if a law is used in such a way that it violates the freedom of citizens to access information, then we have the right to question whether that law is necessary, even if we trust the <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/10/05/hong-kong-netizen-against-introduction-of-internet-filtering/\">lawmaker's intention to protect</a>. </p> <p>Earlier this month, the Hong Kong SAR (special administration region) government published a consultation paper on the comprehensive review of the control of obscene and indecent articles ordinance (<a href=\"http://www.coiao.gov.hk/en/welcome.htm\">COIAO</a>). In the section concerning new media, it proposes that ISPs place filtering software to block obscene and indecent materials. It sounds reasonable: a government seeking to protect children and young people from pornographic and violent materials. But the proposal prompts many questions. Who is to decide which contents are pornographic or violent? How do you distinguish between adults and the under-aged? How do you protect adults' freedoms? Most importantly, how do you prevent this power being abused for political motives?</p> <p>The government insists the consultation is transparent and welcomes citizens' input. However, reading the proposal, one can't help but think this is a document giving the administration the power and convenience to establish an order whenever it deems it necessary. </p> <p>What worries people is the government mentality behind this. Clearly, it doesn't trust its own citizens. People fear this attempt to impose regulation on the internet is just the beginning. The government is behaving like a parent who has lost confidence in communication and education, and chosen instead to impose strict rules. At the beginning of the chapter New Forms of Media, the consultation paper claims:</p> <blockquote> <p>Given the emergence of new forms of media, particularly the growing popularity of the Internet, members of the public consider it important that measures are taken to protect youngsters from the dissemination of obscene and indecent materials on such new media systems.</p> </blockquote> <p>Who are the \"members of the public\"? Can the government claim they speak for the public? Do the public, especially children, as the government imagines; need new protection imposed by the authorities, from indecent materials?</p> <p>The authorities would be better advised to surf the internet more often and learn how people in Hong Kong use the web. People can seek and find the real obscene and indecent materials themselves, or through their circles. But do the same materials spread so quickly only because of the existence of the internet? In reality, similar materials are already easily available in Hong Kong. There are special fengyue (erotica) sections in some of the newspapers. There are adult magazines, wrapped in black plastic bags, available in most newsagents. There was no way to avoid them, even before the internet age. If the government wants to protect children and young people, they should equip our youngsters with the ability to make better judgments themselves with the help of communities, parents and schools.</p> <p>As a citizen of Hong Kong, what I don't want to see is, one day, when I click a link to a website, a blank page. We may not like certain sites, but we don't want to give the government the right to decide for us which sites we should and should not visit. If even this right is removed, what is the justification for \"<a href=\"http://www.info.gov.hk/info/sar5/e12.htm\">one country, two systems</a>\"?</p> <p>This article first appeared, in Chinese, <a href=\"http://www.my1510.cn/article.php?f9620646dd4d0953\">here</a>.</p>",

Combined military deaths came to almost 1.5 million, in addition to 500,000 civilians. The story of Vasily Grigoryevich Zaitsev, a sniper from the Urals who personally bagged somewhere between 250 and 500 Nazis, was championed by the Soviet press.</p> <h2>Casting</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338884894\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/10/22/stal1.jpg\" alt=\"Enemy at the Gates\" width=\"140\" height=\"200\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enemy at the Gates.

The film-makers have Law speaking in a mock cockney accent, as if sounding like he's just dropped out of drama school to hang out in Hoxton is going to convince us that he is the salt of the earth. Meanwhile, the senior Red Army officers speak in polished Etonian. Transposing the English class system to the Soviet hierarchy is brain-achingly wrong. Rather than promoting the bourgeoisie, Stalin liquidated them. Most embarrassingly of all, Soviet political commissar Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev's peasant origins are implied by having him played by \u00fcber-cockney Bob Hoskins. Which would be fine, if this was a comedy.</p> <h2>Details</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338884895\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/10/22/stal2.jpg\" alt=\"Enemy at the Gates\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enemy at the Gates.

The real Khrushchev described these in his memoirs as being done out in oak plywood, like Stalin's dachas, and was sniffy about what he considered to be the unnecessary luxury of a flushing toilet. The headquarters soon moved to less cosy surroundings, but in either case the officers' decadent lifestyle as implied in the film is incorrect; as are the early battle sequences, which seem to have been plagiarised from Saving Private Ryan rather than recreating the style of combat at Stalingrad. On the other hand, Khrushchev's filthy language (\"The Nazis are beginning to shit their pants!\") is spot on.</p> <h2>War</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338884896\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/10/22/stal3.jpg\" alt=\"Enemy at the Gates\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enemy at the Gates.

When it looks like K\u00f6nig might have succeeded, Khrushchev yells: \"If it's confirmed that he's dead, we're sunk!\" It seems impossible that the fate of the entire eastern front could have hung on the life of one man, and that's because it is. At most, Zaitsev killed about 0.07% of the Nazi troops who died at Stalingrad. The film's shoot-outs between Zaitsev and K\u00f6nig are pure invention, not least because K\u00f6nig himself probably didn't exist. Furthermore, you could leave the cinema believing that Khrushchev led the Red Army at Stalingrad, because the real commanders \u2013 Vasilevsky, Chuikov and Zhukov \u2013 are nowhere to be seen.</p> <h2>Romance</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338884897\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/10/22/stal6.jpg\" alt=\"Enemy at the Gates\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enemy at the Gates.

We tried so hard to create a society that was equal, where there'd be nothing to envy your neighbour.

  "<p>We're getting quite used to the idea that the market is not as perfect as its ideologues would have us believe. So it wasn't too much of a surprise to hear that the Office of Fair Trading thinks newspaper distribution should <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/oct/22/pressandpublishing-mediabusiness\">continue to be protected from competition law</a>. </p> <p>In its guidance, revealed yesterday after an interminable investigation, the OFT said it did not think it would refer the newspaper and magazine supply system to the Competition Commission. This will upset some independent retailers who are less than delighted with the arrangement that gives wholesalers \"absolute territorial protection\".</p> <p>It means that retailers cannot choose between different wholesalers, who enjoy exclusive rights to distribute within agreed areas. The system could be justified in the case of newspapers, said the OFT, because their time-sensitivity as daily publications, which require rapid and efficient delivery.</p> <p>But magazine sales were not subject to this same pressure, meaning that there was \"greater scope\" for competition between wholesalers. The OFT is now leaving it to publishers, distributors and wholesalers to decide whether the current regime is compliant with competition law. Not retailers, you note.</p> <p>So, unsurprisingly, the <strong>Newspaper Publishers Association</strong> greeted the decision, with its chairman, <strong>Tim Brooks</strong>, saying: \"We welcome the overall approach taken by the OFT. It will help underpin current and future distribution arrangements for newspapers to the benefit of all our readers throughout the UK.\"</p> <p>The magazine industry's trade body, the <strong>Periodical Publishers Association</strong>, was a little less happy. Its chief executive, <strong>Jonathan Shephard</strong>, said the OFT had not fully appreciated \"the value and volume of the highly time-sensitive magazines, including TV listings magazines, classified magazines, celebrity magazines and the many weekly news and women's interests titles.\"</p> <p>I expected this outcome from the OFT inquiry, which has taken far too long. The current system works, as it has done for decades, and it would be folly to tamper with it.</p> <p>However, I also sympathise with those retailers who believe that being in thrall to a single wholesaler is an unfair practice. I imagine it will persuade yet more of them to throw in the towel, reducing still further the trade in newspapers.</p>",
  "<p>Hundreds of people are being held on death row in Nigeria, according to an Amnesty International <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/poverty-and-the-death-penalty-in-nigeria-20081021\">report</a> published this week \u2013 many of whom did not have a fair trail and may be innocent of any crime. </p> <p>Prisoners on death row are held in cells where they can witness executions. \"After a prisoner has been hanged, other death row prisoners are forced to clean the gallows,\" it adds.</p> <p>Co-authored by Amnesty and a Nigerian legal organisation, the <a href=\"http://www.ledapnigeria.org/\">Legal Defence and Assistance Project </a>(Ledap), the report says the country's justice system is \"riddled with corruption, negligence and a nearly criminal lack of resources.\" Amnesty's researcher in Nigeria, Aster van Kregten, writes:</p> <p>\"It is truly horrifying to think of how many innocent people may have been executed and may still be executed. The judicial system is riddled with flaws that can have devastating consequences. For those accused of capital crimes, the effects are obviously deadly and irreversible.\"</p> <p>Death penalty trials can take more than a decade to conclude: some appeals have been pending for up to 24 years, others are never heard because case files go missing. At least 40 of the prisoners on death row were aged between 13 and 17 at the time of their alleged offence, though international law forbids the death penalty for minors. </p> <p>Confessions are often extracted under torture, says Amnesty, and the majority of those on death row were sentenced on the basis of confessions alone. Although it is against Nigerian law, police torture suspects on a daily basis: 80% of prison inmates say they have been beaten, threatened with weapons or tortured by police.</p> <p>Yet Ledap's national co-ordinator Chino Obiagwu points out that confessions obtained \"under pressure, threat or torture\" are inadmissible as evidence under Nigerian law. Although \"judges know that there is widespread torture by the police, they continue to sentence suspects to death based on these confessions.\"</p> <p>The public in Nigeria are, however, largely unmindful of these abuses because the high crime rate puts pressure on police to make quick arrests after a crime is committed. Sometimes, Obiagwu says, \"if the police are unable to find a suspect, they arrest the wife, mother or brother of the suspect instead - or even a witness.\"</p> <p>He adds that those who can pay to stay out of prison do so - whether by hiring a lawyer, bribing the police to properly investigate a case, or buying their way onto a list of those eligible for pardon - leaving the poor to suffer the brunt of the injustice.</p> <p>There is a widespread suspicion in Nigeria that some unfortunate people, usually the very poor, are made scapegoats for crimes (especially armed robbery) that are either committed in collusion with corrupt elements in the police, or by well-heeled criminals who are clever enough to stay several steps ahead of the police. A further complication is that because of delays in the investigation of cases, the public tends to forget the circumstances surrounding particular crimes, and the police can get away with prosecuting the wrong culprits. The judiciary does not help by granting police requests for long adjournments, during which the accused are on remand. Nigerian society needs to grapple with this problem urgently, if the impression is not to remain that it has become so callous that it no longer cares who is punished for such crimes, so long as someone is convicted.</p> <p>Amnesty has called on the Nigerian government to observe \"an immediate moratorium\" on executions in the country. Nigerian administrations are not known for paying attention to the views of outside bodies like Amnesty, which they often regard as \"interfering\" entities that apply the standards of western countries to Nigerian society. But they do seek to cut a good figure for themselves abroad, and if powerful voices in the west, particularly the European Parliament, were to raise the issue at the joint meetings they periodically hold with the African Pacific and Caribbean nations, the Nigerians would take some notice, if only to avoid embarrassment. </p> <p>Nigeria's president, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6187249.stm\">Umaru Musa Yar'Adua</a>, should be particularly embarrassed by Amnesty's report. His elder brother, <a href=\"http://www.africansuccess.org/visuFiche.php?id=268&amp;lang=en\">General Shehu Musa Yar'Adua</a>, died in a Nigerian prison in December 1997. He had been accused of plotting to overthrow the dictator, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1998/06/98/after_abacha/109297.stm\">Sani Abacha</a>, and sentenced to death. He was on death row at Abakaliki prison in Ebonyi state when, according to reports, he was forcibly injected with a poison that killed him.</p> <p>Many Nigerians will wonder how it is that their president, who took office ten years after his brother's death, holds his brother's ghastly death in such poor memory as to tolerate the incarceration of other people's brothers under the same conditions which brought him so much grief.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was updated at 10am with some additional information.</p>",
  "<p>Indian women may be climbing the <a href=\"http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Corporate_Trends/Indra_Nooyi_most_powerful_woman_in_US_business_Fortune/articleshow/3542531.cms\">global power lists</a> but that doesn't stop our top politicos from rapping us on the knuckles for straying from where we belong: home. </p> <p>Earlier this month, Soumya Vishwanathan, a television journalist in Delhi, was killed on her way back from work.

Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit <a href=\"http://www.ibnlive.com/news/cm-sorry-for-journos-death-admits-city-unsafe/74867-3.html\">said</a> she regretted Vishwanathan's death but felt that she should not have been so \"adventurous\". Now she's appealing to employers to ensure safety for female employees. Because, of course, cleaning up the city \u2013 known to be <a href=\"http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/000200810091932.htm\">notoriously unsafe</a> for women \u2013 would take too much work. </p> <p>Vishwanathan's death may not have been related to her gender but the debate on women's safety has been churned up, with many echoing Dikshit's sentiments. This is not new. As Indian women step into new-found freedom, there are frequents attempts to bind our feet. Three years back, when a call centre worker in Bangalore was raped and killed by the driver of the company car, a flurry of voices advised women to avoid night shifts. In Karnataka, <a href=\"http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080925/jsp/nation/story_9884741.jsp\">the law prohibits</a> women from working at night in most industries (media and the IT-enabled services industry are exceptions). </p> <p>Recently, when the Karnataka High Court repealed a ban on female bartenders, the <a href=\"http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1193348&amp;pageid=2\">police cautioned</a> that crimes against women would increase. </p> <p>Feminists protest against such regressive attitudes and laws \u2013 and with good reason. By shifting responsibility from the state to the individual woman, they make society more unsafe in the long run. When something happens to a woman, the kneejerk reaction is to assume that she is the miscreant, the breaker of rules. By curtailing women's freedom and mobility, they impede our ability to compete in an economy that has to keep up with a global clock \u2013 a professional handicap that increases our dependence on men as financial providers. The fear factor makes women physically and psychologically dependent, exacerbates a sense of victimhood and encourages helplessness. It's harder for women to engage in social activities, build support systems or get involved in political or community issues. </p> <p>I'm not advocating that we sacrifice ourselves on the altar of bravado and women's lib but isn't it time to give the blame back where it belongs? Our cities are unsafe. And this is largely due to poor infrastructure (dingy alleys, badly-lit streets, poor public transport) and inadequate or unresponsive policing, as a recent planning commission report said. Funny thing. Because there <em>are</em> occasions when cops swarm the streets. When a political bigwig comes visiting, for example. During public festivals, processions, the rare gay pride march. Clearly, women's safety is not so high on the priority list.</p> <p>Because no matter what the situation is, it's presented as though it is women's fault for not toeing the Cinderella line. It's our fault for not asking employers for special privileges. It's our fault for venturing out in the first place. </p> <p>What Madam Dikshit (and others like her) would do well to remember is that in most Indian cities, stepping out alone <em>anytime</em> after dark constitutes \"adventurousness\" for a woman. Safe streets should be a basic right, not a luxury. It would be heartening if one felt that the government was taking the problem seriously and making some moves in the right direction. But sadly, year after year, all we get is the same old blame game, some sanctimonious advice, a few regressive laws and no promises, not even empty ones. </p>",
