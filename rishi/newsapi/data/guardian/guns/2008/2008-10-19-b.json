  "<p>Marine biologists have warned of significant and serious changes in the seas around Britain after detecting a steep and \"frightening\" fall in the numbers of common seals around the coast.</p> <p>Common seals are one of Britain's largest and most charismatic marine predators and the most likely to be seen by holidaymakers and sailors. But the latest surveys have revealed a dramatic decline in their numbers in Scotland's waters and along eastern England.</p> <p>In the worst affected areas, such as the Orkney islands, the numbers of common seals are falling by 10% a year, and have dropped by as much as half in the past six years. Along the Argyll coast, from Oban to the Mull of Kintyre, the numbers fell by a quarter last year. </p> <p>Ian Boyd, a professor with the sea mammals research unit at St Andrew's University, said it was as if the entire population had stopped breeding. </p> <p>The cause was baffling scientists. \"We just don't know,\" he said. \"Our collective view is that there's some large-scale process going on in the northern North Sea which is driving down seal numbers. We're seeing a massive decline. It's quite a frightening decline because these populations don't change as quickly as that under normal circumstances. </p> <p>\"This is very abnormal. To give you an idea of the level of abnormality, the rates of decline are equivalent to these populations producing no offspring for five or six years.\" </p> <p>The steep declines mirror other crises in the marine environment. Biologists have reported plummeting sea bird populations, with falls of a third in numbers of puffins on the Farne islands off the Northumberland coast, and the Isle of May at the Firth of Forth, as well as declines in food sources for mammals and birds, such as sand eels. At the same time, warmer-water animals from plankton through to large fish are moving north.</p> <p>Boyd said it was too early to say whether climate change was directly connected to the collapse of seal populations. He said his unit and other marine biologists were investigating a number of possibilities, including the theory that common seals - also known as harbour seals - were up against stiff competition from the larger, more robust grey seals for increasingly scarce food supplies.</p> <p>Some studies suggested that killer whales, now hunting in larger numbers around Orkney and Shetland, were killing seals at pupping time. </p> <p>People could be illegally shooting the seals in fish-farming areas and at inshore fishing grounds. But Boyd said these problems were localised and could not explain the UK-wide declines. The causes were likely to be complex.</p> <p>The latest findings will be raised at a conference this month in Edinburgh run by the conservation agency Scottish Natural Heritage, which will give conservationists the chance to debate the challenges of climate change, alien species and conflicts between species, including common and grey seals.</p> <p>All the main environment groups want the Scottish government to use powers under the proposed marine bill for Scotland to legally protect common seals, by abolishing the Seal Conservation Act 1970, which allows salmon farmers and the fishing industry to legally shoot seals that appear to damage their nets. Instead, seals should be a protected species under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, they say. </p> <p>The Guardian has learned that the latest figures show that last year common seal numbers fell from 4,256 to 3,379 in Orkney, from 1,056 to 800 along the eastern coast of the northern Highlands, from 113 to 102 in the north-east, in Grampian, and from 6,702 to 4,732 on the west coast from Oban to the Mull of Kintyre. There was also a fall, from 445 to 215, in Fife, and by nearly half in the smaller populations around Lothian and Dumfries and Galloway. </p> <p>In English waters, smaller populations at the nature reserves at Blakeney Point, in Norfolk, and Donna Nook, in Lincolnshire, also fell sharply. </p> <p>Some areas have shown increases, particularly the Wash, where numbers rose from 1,695 to 2,162 last year. But total numbers across the UK fell by 12% last year at the 13 sites where counts were made over two years - down by 3,120 animals to 23,277, a drop that early figures suggest has continued this year. </p> <p>Boyd said that, by contrast, there had been \"rapid growth\" in the nearest population on the continent, in the Wadden Sea, off the Dutch, German and Danish coasts. \"We ought to be worried because these animals are at the top of the marine food chain and are in a sense bellwethers of what's going on in the marine environment,\" he said. \"Quite apart from the fact that they're charismatic species, they're indicators of the level of robustness that there is within the marine environment, and if we're seeing populations declining rapidly like this, it's got to ring alarm bells.\"</p> <p>John Baxter, a senior marine biologist with Scottish Natural Heritage, said the agency shared was helping investigate the decline. \"These fluctuations are very large, and we've no way of knowing whether there's a natural fluctuation and numbers may recover, or whether there're more serious underlying causes.\"</p>",
  "<p>The emerging pressure from different member states to scale back EU climate policy in the face of economic downturn is a major blow, both to the environment and to the EU economy (Europe's leaders struggle to stop emissions package unravelling, October 17). </p> <p>The French presidency appears to be driving for an agreement based on the lowest common denominator, effectively giving every member state the possibility to beg for special treatment. The aim is clearly to bully the European parliament into accepting an agreement at any cost.</p> <p>The parliament must not and will not succumb. This a la carte approach would rip all substance out of the package, leaving the EU with an empty shell of legislation which makes a mockery of its supposed \"global leadership\".</p> <p>Many of the measures to reduce our emissions are no-brainers for the economy. Improving efficiency - whether of vehicles, industrial production through the emissions trading scheme (ETS), power generation or buildings - will save money. It will reduce our dependence on energy imports and the massive economic instability that this brings. So too will increasing the development of renewable energies, which will also create thousands of jobs. </p> <p>Climate policy offers an opportunity to shift our economies away from the boom-bust cycle of an overexploitative, speculative fossil-fuel-based economy. Failure to grasp it will exacerbate both the economic and the climate crises.<br><strong>Dr Caroline Lucas MEP</strong><br>Leader, Green party</p> <p>The importance of the statement by Europe's leaders to get a deal on the climate change should not be underestimated. There has been intense lobbying by some in industry for months (long before the current financial crisis) to derail the fast-track timetable, which should see Euro-MPs and ministers reach rapid agreement on a package of laws to deliver the 2020 targets. </p> <p>But Thursday's statement by EU leaders, together with the big majorities in the committee stage in the European parliament, provide a solid foundation for future work. The ball is now in the court of the French government, current chair of the EU, to put a negotiating text on the table quickly so that a final agreement can be reached by Christmas. MEPs are ready. Ministers must deliver.<br><strong>Linda McAvan MEP</strong><br>European spokesperson on climate change, Labour party</p> <p>Your article on the Eliasch review regarding forests and climate change (Global fund 'could pay owners to keep rainforests safe', October 14) says Guyana supports a new approach to forest conservation based on carbon trading. What the piece does not mention is that local communities in Guyana have not been properly involved in discussions. Having just returned from Guyana, I can attest that most of those who will be affected have no idea what carbon is, let alone what implications the international carbon market may have for them. In many cases, the land claims by Guyana's indigenous peoples remain unresolved more than 40 years after independence from Britain. If efforts to save the world's forests are to succeed, they must ensure communities' involvement in decision-making. Crucially, the rights of those who depend on the forest must be respected.<br><strong>Tom Griffiths</strong><br>Forest Peoples Programme</p> <p>The Eliasch review is unequivocal that carbon markets offer the best financing mechanism available, measured by efficiency, effectiveness and equity, and that reducing tropical deforestation is essential to stabilising the global climate by mid-century. The figure of $3.7tn, raised as the potential long-term net benefit from halving deforestation, is as much as, if not more than, the amount lost to date in the global financial crisis. </p> <p>Current EU regulation bans forest credits from the EU ETS, thereby effectively preventing investment. The EU parliament environment and industry committees, with cross-party support, have each now proposed amendments to the linking directive to lift this ban. But with the European commission opposed to change, it will be the decision of the council of ministers. If the UK government meant what it said in endorsing the Eliasch review, it should vote in favour of admitting forest-based credits into the scheme from 2013. Ed Miliband may be new to office, but he must seize this opportunity quickly. We urge him to show leadership in Europe. <br><strong>Henry Derwent</strong><br>Chief executive officer, International Emissions Trading Association, <br><strong>Abyd Karmali</strong><br>President, Carbon Markets &amp; Investors Association</p> <p>It's great news that Ed Miliband has started his new role at the Department for Energy and Climate Change by announcing a target of at least 80% emissions cuts by 2050 (Report, October 17). His commitment to a target of 30% cuts by 2020 across Europe is also to be applauded. However, he must also ensure that these two targets are not undermined by the continued building of high-carbon infrastructure while buying in carbon credits from overseas. Building new coal-fired plants completely points in the wrong direction. <br><strong>Sara Shaw</strong><br>Climate change policy adviser, Tearfund</p> <p>An 80% target for reducing carbon emissions will rightfully draw gasps of glee and questions on how to meet it in equal measure. It is an ambitious challenge, and one which cannot be met without carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. </p> <p>If the UK is to stand any chance of meeting this goal it is essential CCS is developed without delay. Despite some opinion, fossil fuels will remain the backbone of the UK's energy mix, and CCS is the only viable way to prevent carbon emissions from entering the atmosphere. It is not the only answer, but CCS must be part of the climate change solution. <br><strong>Dr Jeff Chapman</strong><br>Chief executive, Carbon Capture and Storage Association</p>",
  "<p>Taliban insurgents killed 25 Afghan civilians, including a child, after firing on one bus and seizing control of another in the southern province of Kandahar, a local police chief said yesterday.</p> <p>Violence in the war-torn country has surged this year ,with attacks at their highest level in six years, the UN's senior envoy in Afghanistan said this month. Some 4,000 people have died this year, a third of them civilians.</p> <p>The attack on the buses happened last Thursday in the Maywand district of Kandahar, the spiritual home of the Taliban.</p> <p>The insurgents tried to stop one of the buses, but it carried on driving, said Kandahar's police chief, Matiullah Qateh. The Taliban then fired on the bus, killing one child. They managed to stop the second bus, carrying about 50 passengers, and killed 24 of them, freeing the rest, Qateh said. Although an inquiry was launched on Thursday, the bodies were only found later, some distance from the road, he added.</p> <p>The Afghan Defence Ministry spokesman, Gen. Mohammad Zahir Azimi, said 31 people were killed. Six of the dead were beheaded in a separate area of Maiwand from where the other 25 bodies were found, he said. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Taliban, Qari Muhammad Yousuf, told Reuters they had killed 27 people he said were Afghan soldiers. It was not possible to independently verify any of the casualty figures, due to poor security and lack of access to the area.</p> <p>Azimi dismissed the Taliban claim that 27 soldiers had been killed. \"Our soldiers travel by military convoy, not in civilian buses. And we have military air transportation,\" he said. \"The Taliban want to hide the news that they arrested and killed innocent Afghan civilians,\" Khan said. </p> <p>Taliban militants often launch attacks against Afghan and foreign soldiers, but 80% of their victims are Afghan civilians, security experts say.</p>",
  "<p>Swiss Re, the world's largest reinsurance company, has joined forces with the private equity group CVC in a bid for the Direct Line and Churchill Insurance businesses of Royal Bank of Scotland. The deal is expected to value the operations at \u00a36bn.</p> <p>The CVC-led bid is being directed by RBS's former financial director Fred Watts, who quit the bank in 2005. He had been with RBS for five and a half years and joined CVC last year.</p> <p>It is understood that the deal will see CVC-Swiss Re pay some \u00a33bn to take a 51% stake in RBS's insurance business, which also includes Privilege, Green Flag, UKI Partnerships and NIG. The two sides of the deal are said to be in \"advanced talks\" and CVC has been given up to six weeks to complete the transaction.</p> <p>RBS - which has been torn apart by the credit crisis and is now in line for a capital injection from the UK government that would put the government in control of the Edinburgh-based bank with a 60% stake - has been attempting to sell its insurance operations for six months. It put the division up for sale when it announced plans to raise \u00a312bn from shareholders to bolster its core capital. It now requires another \u00a320bn and its chief executive, Sir Fred Goodwin, and chairman, Sir Tom McKillop, are leaving. Goodwin had always been opposed to a fire sale of the insurance business.</p> <p>The \u00a36bn valuation of the insurance business will be regarded as a good price, although back in the summer the bank had hoped to achieve \u00a37bn. RBS is the second-largest general insurer in the UK and has 18,000 staff. It is the UK's largest insurer of cars, as well as a major player in travel, home and pet insurance. It also provides cover for 2 million motorists overseas and is the biggest direct insurer in Spain.</p> <p>CVC is said to be putting up most of the capital to fund the deal, with Swiss Re underwriting the risk. There is speculation that a third party may also be brought into the consortium.</p> <p>Last night, CVC refused to comment on its talks with RBS, but a deal between the two will be seen as a setback for the US insurer Allstate, which it is thought had been in pole position to buy the entire business, rather than just a majority stake. </p> <p>CVC, which is based in Luxembourg, has 19 offices across Europe and its past investments have included Hozelock, Debenhams, Formula One, the Saga/AA brands and the Belgian postal service. It currently owns 49 companies worldwide, employing some 376,000 people. It has 38 investments in Europe and 14 in Asia.</p> <p>Swiss Re, based in Zurich, operates in 25 countries and provides insurance for insurers, mainly for property and casualty risks, life and health insurance.</p> <p>RBS is also reported to be reviewing the future of its Ulster Bank and First Active offshoots in Ireland. The Irish Independent reported yesterday that the heads of all RBS divisions had been summoned to meetings with their new boss, Stephen Hester, in the coming weeks. Earlier this week Hester said the business was likely to be shrunk and that a list of saleable assets was now likely to get longer.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>Direct Line was founded in 1985 to sell insurance straight to motorists by phone. It was backed with \u00a320m of funding from RBS and created controversy because a pay deal agreed with the insurer's founder, Peter Wood, made him one of the UK's best-paid businessmen. Churchill Insurance was launched in 1989 and acquired by RBS in 2003 for \u00a31.1bn. Churchill's founder, Martin Long, made an estimated \u00a360m in the deal.</p>",
  "<p>'My life has been a series of accidents,\" says Raissa Khan-Panni cheerfully. She's not kidding. The fact that she is a singer comes down to a random encounter with a busker when she was 16. She bagged her first record deal at 21 on the strength of just three songs. Her new band, the Mummers, came together by chance. Unlucky timing meant her two sons, 10 and three, were born just as she was embarking on these separate chapters in her musical career. Their births heightened Khan-Panni's awareness of the need to \"make the most of the accidents when they come along. You have to be prepared.\"</p> <p>She wasn't ready for her first stab at pop fame. Signed to an independent label when she was still studying music in Bristol, she was quickly picked up by Polydor and \"spoiled. I was in a very privileged position, and I wasted time doing nothing.\" That's not quite true: under the name Raissa, she and her two-piece band recorded three albums in quick succession. \"We banged them out,\" she admits. \"I was still finding my way, vocally and musically. I didn't have the vision that I have now.\"</p> <p>The Mummers are \"totally different in every single way\" from the work she did as Raissa. Their debut album, Tale to Tell, is a lushly orchestrated, Technicolor fantasia, inspired by \"marching bands, big bands and fairgrounds\", not to mention Rufus Wainwright. The songs were recorded live in Brighton, with as many local musicians as she could gather together. Now 32, Khan-Panni thinks she was edging towards this \"big, classical\" sound a decade ago - but in 2000, after she had failed to achieve a top 40 hit as Raissa, Polydor dropped her. \"Back at square one, and totally skint,\" with a two-year-old to look after, Khan-Panni got a job as a waitress near her home in south London and tried to work out what to do next. She carried on writing songs, and fell in with the drum'n'bass scene: \"I wanted to experiment with putting vocals on vile, grimy, crusty beats.\"</p> <p>But she knew that wasn't really what she wanted. She had kept in touch with Paul Sandrone, her guitarist from the Raissa days, who had set up his own studio in Brighton. One day in 2005, she visited him to record a few songs. Among them was a cover of Nick Drake's River Man, a tape of which was fortuitously passed to Mark Horwood, a jazz pianist and aspiring film composer. He built an arrangement around her vocal and sent it back to Khan-Panni.</p> <p>The arrangement was \"amazing\", exactly what she had been searching for. There was just one problem: Horwood hadn't given her any contact details, and by the time she tracked him down, he had moved to LA for a year to work on a short film. On his return, she and Sandrone visited Horwood in the treehouse he had built for himself on the outskirts of Brighton. The Mummers started that very day.</p> <p>The treehouse is \"in the middle of the countryside, pine trees all around\", and packed with \"old organs and harmoniums and Indian percussive instruments\" picked up by Horwood while travelling. So it makes sense that the music produced there has a fairy-tale quality. But Khan-Panni says the Mummers' sound is also rooted in her own desire to escape. \"Working in a restaurant, it's a grim slog every day - mundane, tedious, boring. So you create visions just to keep yourself sane.\"</p> <p>She regrets that it has taken so long to realise those visions. \"I'm a bit of a late developer. I live in my own world quite a lot, and I like to dream. I feel life goes too fast for me sometimes.\" Khan-Panni's unorthodox upbringing may have something to do with it. Her father, a political journalist, was born in Hong Kong and grew up in India; her parents met when he was visiting England, and they stayed in London together. Both loved to travel: \"They didn't spend their money on anything, except every couple of years we'd go somewhere brilliant.\" Once, they took Khan-Panni and her younger brother out of school for a three-month trek across India. It had quite an effect on their daughter: \"I always wanted to break out from wherever I was - and when I arrived somewhere, I always wanted to go somewhere else.\"</p> <p>She couldn't abide school, and started bunking off at a young age. She had begun music lessons at five - piano, then oboe - and at 13 she and a friend began busking in Leicester Square. Her parents found out. \"I was shitting it about what Dad would say, but actually his reaction was: 'This is a very good way of earning money.'\" Her father began dropping her off and collecting her from each stint.</p> <p>It was through busking that Khan-Panni discovered she could sing; she was taught by Jocelyn West, a fellow busker and Prince fan. Busking also taught her how to perform. \"You've got to get people's attention,\" she says, \"because you need money, so you learn what works and what doesn't.\" Khan-Panni got to a stage where she could earn \u00a350 an hour.</p> <p>You get the impression she would still be doing it now, if it weren't for \"the busking mafia not letting you play, and constantly being moved on by the police\". It would certainly help to finance the Mummers: since she stopped waitressing to focus on the band, Khan-Panni has effectively been living off credit cards. It's a risky way to live - but she's comfortable with that, because her family has done the same. \"My dad was always taking massive risks. He gave up his job and invested in the stock market just before Black Monday [in 1987]. He lost it all in one day. It was really funny. One day we had a car, and next day we didn't. All of a sudden there was nothing there. I kind of didn't mind: I thought it was liberating.\"</p> <p>For the same reason, she much prefers working independently with the Mummers, without \"a record company breathing down our necks. Even though we don't have any money, we have complete control to build the world we want to build.\"</p> <p>So if a top 40 hit isn't the goal for the Mummers, what is? \"It sounds a bit mad,\" Khan-Panni says, \"but I have one vision in my head. The goal is to have a big band march through Brighton, gathering musicians and people along the way, all the way to London, to the Albert Hall, where we'll do a massive gig. But it won't just be our band playing: because the music is so multilayered, anyone who can tap anything, or play recorder or something, can join in. So if you can get us a gig at the Albert Hall, we can make it all happen\".</p> <p>\u2022 Tale to Tell (Part One) is out now on Big Bass Drum. <strong>The Mummers </strong>play the Hoxton Bar and Kitchen, London N1 (020-7613 0709), on November 11.</p>",
  "<p>Interpol is planning to expand its role into the mass screening of passengers moving around the world by creating a face recognition database to catch wanted suspects.</p> <p>Every year more than 800 million international travellers fail to undergo \"the most basic scrutiny\" to check whether their identity documents have been stolen, the global policing cooperation body has warned. </p> <p>Senior figures want a system that lets immigration officials capture digital images of passengers and immediately cross-check them against a database of pictures of terror suspects, international criminals and fugitives.</p> <p>The UK's first automated face recognition gates - matching passengers to their digital image in the latest generation of passports - began operating at Manchester airport in August.</p> <p>Mark Branchflower, head of Interpol's fingerprint unit, will this week unveil proposals in London for the creation of biometric identification systems that could be linked to such immigration checks. </p> <p>The civil liberties group No2ID, which campaigns against identity cards, expressed alarm at the plans. </p> <p>\"This is a move away from seeking specific persons to GCHQ-style bulk interception of information,\" warned spokesman Michael Parker. </p> <p>\"There's already a fair amount of information collected in terms of passenger records. This is the next step. Law enforcement agencies want the most efficient systems but there has to be a balance between security and privacy.\" The growth of international criminal gangs and the spread of terrorist threats has increased demand for Interpol's services. </p> <p>Last year it carried out 10,000 fingerprint searches; this year the figure will reach 20,000. </p> <p>An automated fingerprint identification system with far greater capacity, known as Metamorpho, will be installed next year. Earlier this month Interpol launched its \"global security initiative\" aimed at raising $1bn (\u00a3577m) to strengthen its law enforcement programmes. It claims to hold the \"names and identifiers\" of 9,000 terrorist suspects.</p> <p>Branchflower will speak at the opening of the Biometrics 2008 conference in Westminster about the possibility of extending its biometric database. </p> <p>Before the conference he said that Interpol wanted to create a face recognition database, to match its fingerprint and DNA records, that could be searched and matched automatically. </p> <p>\"Facial recognition is a step we could go to quite quickly,\" said Branchflower, \"and it's increasingly of use to [all] countries. There's so much data we have but they are in records we can't search.\"</p> <p>If Interpol had been operating a face recognition database linked to national border controls last autumn, he said, it might have picked up a Canadian teacher wanted for child abuse as he entered Thailand. The paedophile was the subject of a high-profile manhunt. </p> <p>\"We could have picked him up the moment he entered Bangkok rather than having to wait another two weeks,\" said Branchflower.\"We need to get our data to the border entry points. There will be such a large role in the future for fingerprints and facial recognition.\"</p>",

  "<p>In a spare half-hour while discussing bailing out American capitalism, the US House of Representatives recently voted through an extraordinary bill with far-reaching implications for Britain's courts. Yet it has received no publicity here and few of Britain's lawyers even know of its existence. </p> <p>By amending the legal code three weeks ago in order to prohibit the recognition and enforcement of foreign defamation judgments in the US, politicians sealed off America's newspaper and book publishers from libel tourism - the use of British libel laws by non-nationals to sue foreign-owned publications such as books, newspapers and magazines that are distributed in Britain, even if only a few copies are involved.</p> <p>Britain's libel laws are widely considered to be among the most severe on publishers - and have been used by people from around the world, and increasingly by Hollywood celebrities, because American defamation laws give publications much greater licence. </p> <p>Steve Cohen, the congressman who drew up the new US legislation, believes it will prevent the exploitation of defamation laws in Britain and other countries that lack the broad protections guaranteed by the US first amendment. </p> <p>His measure is hugely popular in the States. It was passed unanimously, enjoying cross-party support and will now go to the Senate for ratification; it was applauded by the Association of American Publishers, the country's principal book publishing trade body, and greeted enthusiastically by the New York Times on behalf of the newspaper industry. It \"strikes an important blow for free expression\", said a leading article, which noted that people have been getting around America's \"high bar on libel lawsuits\" by \"bringing lawsuits in Britain where libel protections are notoriously weak\". </p> <p>There have been very few voices raised against the measure. Two of the most notable have been a Belfast-based solicitor, Paul Tweed, who has a lengthy record of success acting for US celebrities in libel actions in England and Ireland, and a leading New York lawyer, John J Walsh.</p> <p>\"I have a respect for British jurisprudence and I also esteem responsible journalism,\" Walsh says. \"This bill makes it less likely that people who suffer from irresponsible journalism in publications that appear in Britain will have the chance for redress.\" Walsh believes that the US, by seeking worldwide immunity from court decisions elsewhere, is in effect trying to export its first amendment to the rest of the globe. </p> <p>Tweed, speaking from New York where he is lobbying to appear before the Senate's judiciary committee before it rubber-stamps the bill, said: \"It's disgraceful. Congress is cocking a snook at UK libel law without considering all the implications. I want to give senators a balanced view.\"</p> <p>He knows, however, that he is facing an uphill battle. In an odd twist, the so-called libel tourism bill is the federal offshoot of a law passed by the state of New York that is connected to fears of terrorism.</p> <p>In 2004, the Saudi billionaire Khalid bin Mahfouz launched a libel action against Rachel Ehrenfeld, the author of a book entitled Funding Evil: How Terrorism is Financed and How to Stop it, which alleged that Mahfouz financed al-Qaida in the years leading up to 9/11, a claim that Mahfouz strenuously denied. </p> <p>Even though the book was not published in Britain, a British court agreed to hear the case because some copies were sold online. Ehrenfeld did not appear to defend it, and Mahfouz was awarded substantial damages. </p> <p>Ehrenfeld then sued Mahfouz in New York to obtain a declaration that the judgment would not be enforced in the US because her book was not defamatory under US law. </p> <p>That suit was dismissed and, in response to this judgment, the New York state legislature passed the libel terrorism protection act. Walsh and Tweed believe that the link between libel terrorism and libel tourism has played a large part in convincing politicians to transform the New York law into a federal one. \"It means that people will be denied a way of obtaining recompense for injury to their reputations,\" Tweed says. \"And it is an insult to the British legal system, which was the foundation stone of America's laws too.\"</p> <p>But Tweed's sense of outrage is certainly not shared by every British media lawyer. Mark Stephens, for example, represented Ehrenfeld and advised her not to fight the Mahfouz action in London, predicting that she would lose even if she appeared. He welcomes the new American law. \"It means that libel tourists will not be able to use their wealth and power against people who cannot afford to defend themselves in Britain,\" he says. \"It should be the case that people should sue in the jurisdiction where an alleged libel is published.\" </p> <p>Stephens is also planning to address the Senate judiciary committee - where he says he will point out that Tweed's major concern is that he will lose part of his income from representing US celebrities. </p> <p>I put this to Tweed, who rejects the idea that he is \"the king of libel tourism\". \"People come to me because they want fair play and Britain's libel laws offer a way of achieving it that is not available under American laws. Anyway, the cases I handle for high-profile personalities form only a small proportion of my workload.\"</p> <p>But he acknowledges that he has helped a string of \"personalities\" to win damages against both US-based and British publications by adopting a strategy of suing simultaneously in London, Belfast and Dublin. Among his clients have been Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Colin Farrell and Harrison Ford. He has never lost a case. </p> <p>Though Tweed is far from alone in representing actors in libel tourism cases, his fight in the US has little support from other lawyers who handle similar cases. A leading London-based lawyer who is well-known for representing celebrities in libel cases feels relaxed about it. \"US courts have failed for some time to recognise British libel rulings unless there is clear proof of malice by the offender. This won't change anything,\" he says. </p> <p>But Paul Gilbert, a media lawyer for Finers Stephens Innocent, disagrees. He thinks US organisations sued in London will take heart from the new law and dig in their heels if judgments go against them. Their insurers may well make it as difficult as possible to extract payment. US publishers may also reduce their assets in London to avoid paying damages. </p> <p>The walls of Paul Tweed's Belfast office are lined with framed newspaper articles about his famous clients. It looks very likely that he will not be adding to that collection.</p>",
  "<p>The battle of the nearly men resulted in an ultimately emphatic victory for the Cardiff Blues. Gloucester continue to be handicapped by a propensity to self-destruct, and while key decisions went against them yesterday, they had not complained the previous week when Biarritz left Kingsholm muttering imprecations against Scottish referees.</p> <p>The Blues enjoyed an element of fortune - their last two tries resulted from undetected knock-ons, while James Simpson-Daniel looked to have been tackled before he clutched at a kick in the final minutes - but they were well worth a win which leaves them at the top of the group with maximum points.</p> <p>The Blues played with freedom, expression and skill and Gloucester struggled to breach their blitz defence once Ryan Lamb hobbled off with a hip injury shortly before half-time. The Blues were dangerous in broken play, passing speed and accuracy supplementing clever lines of running.</p> <p>Gloucester have opted for a pragmatic approach this season but yesterday, after fighting back from a 10-point deficit to be up by four as half-time approached, they became loose and lost the lead. They had taken control, dictating the forward exchanges and playing some sublime rugby behind. It made for one of the best halves in this event for many a year. </p> <p>Lamb has in the past been dropped for taking too many risks, but his departure proved the turning point here. Olly Barkley moved to fly-half, with Mike Tindall shifting to inside-centre, Simpson-Daniel swapping the wing for outside-centre and Lesley Vainikolo coming off the bench. One player going off led to four changes, yet on the bench Gloucester had Willie Walker, whose display at No10 last month had inspired a first league victory at Bath.</p> <p>Barkley threw a casual pass as Gloucester moved the ball left on halfway. It bounced in front of Tindall and was knocked into the path of the Blues wing Leigh Halfpenny, who had a free run to the line. A minute later, Olly Morgan pumped up a high ball; it was knocked on a good few yards, but as Gloucester waited for a whistle, Ben Blair went on a slalom run, making 45 yards before feeding Jamie Robinson. The centre took play into Gloucester's 22 and fed Gareth Thomas for a try under the posts and a 27-17 interval lead.</p> <p>The Blues had started in a whirl, Halfpenny finishing off a flowing move in the third minute - Morgan's tackle was not the most robust - and Blair created space every time he had the ball.</p> <p>The Blues were 13-3 up before Morgan squeezed over in the corner. Balshaw then scored the first of his two tries after the Blues had been shoved off their own scrum ball. The home side should have been down to 14 men when the lock Deiniol Jones committed a professional foul on his own line. He escaped; when the visiting hooker, Olivier Azam, committed a less clear-cut offence at a ruck 30 yards from his own line, he saw yellow.</p> <p>The Blues had the game won by then, scoring their bonus-point try through Nicky Robinson after Gareth Thomas had knocked on. Gloucester, who will today announce that the millionaire businessman Martin St Quinton has bought a 25% stake in the club and a seat on the board, had eight minutes to secure two bonus points with a fourth try and conversion. Simpson-Daniel won the race for a chip through and as he went to catch it, he was tackled by Paul Tito and knocked on. </p> <p>\"This has put us on the back foot in the group,\" said Gloucester's head coach, Dean Ryan. The Blues, in contrast, are nearly there.</p> <p><strong>Cardiff Blues:</strong> Blair; Halfpenny, J Robinson (Sweeney, 80), Shanklin (Roberts, 54), G Thomas; N Robinson, Spice (Rees, 72); Jenkins (Morgan, 79), R Thomas (G Williams, 60), G Powell (Filise, 54), Jones, Tito (capt), Molitika, M Williams (Sowden-Taylor, 76), A Powell. </p> <p><strong>Tries:</strong>Halfpenny 2, G Thomas, N Robinson. <strong>Cons:</strong> Blair 4. <br><strong>Pens:</strong>Blair 3.</p> <p><strong>Gloucester:</strong> Morgan (Walker, 44); Balshaw, Tindall (capt), Barkley, Simpson-Daniel; Lamb (Vainikolo, 38), Cooper (R Lawson, 74); Dickinson, Azam, Nieto, Bortolami, Brown, Buxton (Hazell, 54), Strokosch, Narraway (Eustace, 80).</p> <p><strong>Tries:</strong> Balshaw 2, Morgan. <br><strong>Cons: </strong>Barkley 2. <strong>Pen</strong> Barkley. <br><strong>Sin-bin:</strong> Azam, 73</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong>A Rolland (Ireland). <br><strong>Attendance:</strong>27,114.</p>",
  "<p>A year or two ago, if you'd told me that Barack Obama would be leading John McCain by a seemingly comfortable margin with two weeks to go and asked me what, in their desperation, the Republicans would be talking about to try and scare my fellow Americans into voting against him, I'd have said race. After all, Republicans have race-baited in one form or other in most of our presidential contests since Richard Nixon's time, so it would have seemed impossible to me that they'd miss the chance to do so at a time when Democrats had actually gone to the trouble of nominating an African-American candidate.</p> <p>It's true that we're hearing racial-code talk here and there. But the main fear tactic being employed now is something else. It's that Obama and his associates - and for that matter his supporters and even the regions of the country that he's destined to carry - are anti-American.'<br>Last Friday, in North Carolina, Sarah Palin told a rally that she was proud to be \"with all of you hard-working, very patriotic, um, very, um, pro-America areas of this great nation\". She means here of course that there are anti-American areas of America, and they are where the liberals live, and the people there are voting for Mr Anti-America. </p> <p>This was especially interesting coming from a woman whose husband, Todd Palin, was until just six years ago an enrolled member of a rightwing fringe political party that wanted the state of Alaska to secede from the US. But if you understand rightwing logic, then you'd know that Mr Palin had no choice but to join the Alaska Independence party in 1995, because by that time the America he thought he knew and loved had been brought to ruin by the liberals and socialists and America-haters. See?</p> <p>Likewise, earlier this month, Joe McCain, the brother of John, said that Alexandria and Arlington, the two major cities in the northern Virginia suburbs that lie just across the Potomac River from Washington, were \"communist country\" as far as he was concerned. His brother lives in Arlington when in the nation's capital for work, and his brother's campaign is headquartered there as well, but never mind. A McCain spokeswoman offered a wan apology at the time, but lo and behold, just last Saturday a different McCain spokes-woman said on television that while Obama would perform well in northern Virginia, \"the rest of the state - real Virginia if you will - I think will be very responsive to Senator McCain's message\". This did not seem a planned one-liner. The spokeswoman made the fatal error of saying what she actually thinks. Republican Virginia equals real Virginia. Democratic Virginia is alien and impure.</p> <p>Do you folks do this sort of thing in Britain? I know there's something about the chap on the Clapham omnibus who's supposed to represent some kind of middling everyman. And I know you've got your xenophobes just like we do. But trust me. You don't have a right wing that's anything like our right wing.</p> <p>This point was proved most dramatically by a woman named Michele Bachmann, a member of Congress from Minnesota. In an interview last Friday on Hardball, a leading US cable talk show, host Chris Matthews asked Bachmann whether Obama worried her. \"Absolutely. I'm very concerned that he may have anti-American views,\" she said. He asked her what she thought distinguished liberal from hard left from anti-American. If she maintains such distinctions in her mind, she refused to acknowledge them. Then, finally, Matthews - who deftly fed her the rope to hang herself - asked her how many members of the US Congress held, in her view, anti-American views.</p> <p>It's been almost a two-year campaign. There have been moments we've thought of as memorable, only to see the tide of events erase their mark from the sand. Bachmann's answer, however, will live imperishably: \"What I would say - what I would say is that the news media should do a penetrating expos\u00e9 and take a look. I wish they would. I wish the American media would take a great look at the views of the people in Congress and find out, are they pro-America or anti-America? I think people would love to see an expos\u00e9 like that.\"</p> <p>Before we go any further - who is this Bachmann? She's a first-term backbencher from exurban Minneapolis who says the Lord told her to run for Congress. She declared herself \"a fool for Christ\" in 2006 when she announced her candidacy. By all accounts she's down with the whole rightwing Christian package: immigrants bring disease and pestilence, homosexuals want to indoctrinate straight children, and so on. Republican leadership undoubtedly pushed her out on to television because she is, as you Brits say, a looker - at least by the standards of Congress.</p> <p>The call for an investigation into the beliefs of every federal lawmaker, and an expos\u00e9 of those found wanting in their patriotism, certainly takes us into deeply creepy territory. I would not call Bachmann herself a fascist. Odd as it sounds, to do so would be to grant her far too much credit. For one to embrace an -ism, even a repugnant one, one needs to have read a certain amount of history and political philosophy. Bachmann is just an idiot. She wouldn't know Edmund Burke from Billie Burke (she played the good witch in the Wizard of Oz), and she obviously has no idea that, in her rejection of the two bedrock American principles of separation of church and state and freedom of thought, she is the one who is as anti-American as they come.</p> <p>But friends, all is not darkness. Bachmann's appearance caused a national uproar. Colin Powell, in endorsing Obama yesterday, said of Bachmann's comments that \"we have got to stop this kind of nonsense and pull ourselves together\". Her Democratic opponent raised nearly half a million dollars from around the country in just 24 hours, and he now has a chance of beating her.</p> <p>That would be nice. But let's go back to the big contest. With Bachmann, the lid came off the rightwing id. It will happen many more times over these next two weeks. McCain, now openly using the word \"socialist\" to describe Obama's proposals (the week after his friend George W Bush took federal control of nine major banks!), and especially Palin have shown every sign of encouraging it. Their goal is to scare Americans about Obama, but moderate, independent voters might well decide that Obama looks a lot less scary than they do.</p> <p>\u2022Michael Tomasky is editor of Guardian America <br><a href=\"mailto:michael.tomasky@theguardian.com\">michael.tomasky@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Secret files on informers operating in the IRA and other paramilitary groups during the Troubles would be unavailable to a future Sinn F\u00e9in justice minister in Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland security minister has confirmed.</p> <p>Paul Goggins also confirmed that the justice minister would not see all classified intelligence on present counter-terrorist strategy. Goggins said that when policing and justice powers are transferred from Westminster to Belfast, issues of UK national security will remain with ministers in London. </p> <p>His remarks appear to assuage grassroots unionist fears over the prospect of a future Sinn F\u00e9in justice minister being able to pore over secret files relating to the conflict or anti-terrorist security policies.</p> <p>Hardline unionists opposed to the power-sharing deal between the Democratic Unionists and Sinn F\u00e9in claim that a minister from the party that was linked to the IRA could soon have access to high-grade intelligence material on the past and the present, including the identities of state agents.</p> <p>During the Troubles dozens of nationalists, most of them members of the IRA and other republican insurgent groups, were killed for being alleged informers.</p> <p>Pressed on accessibility to information on agents, past and present, Goggins said: \"They [future ministers] would not have direct access to that. There will be no access to past files either.\" He also stressed that any new devolved justice department would not have full control of the Northern Ireland judiciary. Judges, he said, would still be appointed independent of executive government.</p> <p>Goggins warned loyalist paramilitary groups that time was running out over the decommissioning of arms. Unlike the IRA, neither the Ulster Volunteer Force or the Ulster Defence Association has put any weapons beyond use. The minister signalled that an amnesty that allows loyalists to hold weapons meant for decommissioning may be removed, with the prospect of the security forces launching search and arrest operations for arms.</p> <p>\"They [the loyalists] have got about five months,\" he said. \"It [the amnesty order] is subject to annual renewal and the order ends in 2010. If I was going to ask for that law after February 2009, for the third time, I know I will be asked at Westminster ... 'Why are we doing this?' People at Westminster would be asking why I am going back to them again asking for these abnormal powers. So the clock is running down.\"</p> <p>He challenged the loyalists to speed up the process towards disarming.</p> <p>Goggins said he agreed with the International Monitoring Commission's last report that the IRA had ceased to exist as a paramilitary force. </p> <p>The IRA's army council was \"no longer functioning\", he said. On the last report by the body overseeing the status of the paramilitary ceasefires, Goggins said: \"There is a degree of finality about it.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Watts Memorial of Heroic Deeds in London's Postman's Park, which celebrates selfless acts of everyday heroism by ordinary people, has already featured on stage in Patrick Marber's Closer, where the character of Alice takes her name from the plaque to Alice Ayres, who died in 1885 rescuing her master's children from a house fire.</p> <p>It is not just Ayres, but the stories of 53 people whose lives were lost saving others that get an airing here in Lone Twin's piece. It becomes a roll-call of death staged in style recalling Victorian melodrama or the music hall and living tableaux of the era. The result is touchingly comic and oddly moving. \"Ladies and gents. Stay with us. Stay alive,\" exhort our hosts. It is good advice - as the body count rises, life feels fragile, and it becomes clear that Victorian England was a catastrophe of runaway express trains, out-of-control horses and fast-flowing rivers. There is even a pantomime artist burned to death rescuing an actor set ablaze by footlights.</p> <p>As the piece progresses you become aware that what you are witnessing is a celebration of failure. Not only did the protagonists lose their own lives, but in many cases the person or people they were trying to save died, too. Yet the playfulness and freshness of Lone Twin's approach turns the maudlin into a shy affirmation of life and the need to honour heroics whatever the outcome.</p>",
  "<p>The new government minister in charge of a string of vital decisions about Britain's media and technology industries has claimed that the importance of securing their future has increased due to the global financial crisis.</p> <p>Stephen Carter, who was appointed to the new role of minister for communications, technology and broadcasting earlier this month and reports to both the culture secretary, Andy Burnham, and the business secretary, Peter Mandelson, vowed to accelerate decision-making in a number of key areas. </p> <p>\"Whatever is going to happen to the macro-economy, we can all agree that, in the short- and possibly medium-term, the financial services sector is going to take some time to restructure,\" said Carter, in his first interview since taking the job. \"So, from a UK plc perspective, this is an important sector and it becomes relatively an even more important sector.\"</p> <p>Carter, the founding chief executive of the media regulator Ofcom, who most recently spent a turbulent 10 months as Gordon Brown's chief of strategy and principal adviser, will draw together work in existing areas of government and has promised to deliver swift conclusions on a number of pressing issues. These include the future of digital radio, the questions surrounding the next generation of broadband access and mobile phone networks, and the future funding of public-service broadcasting. </p> <p>His report, Digital Britain, will also consider issues around the digital divide and look into whether there should be a guarantee of universal access to broadband for all consumers. He has promised to deliver a set of recommendations by January. </p> <p>Carter said it was a \"unique opportunity\" to set the direction of the broadcasting, technology and communications industries over the next five years. </p> <p>\"While we have a converged regulator, the machinery of government is still separated,\" he said. \"That was the rationale behind having a ministerial responsibility across the brief, and having someone who knows something about it.\" </p> <p>Carter's appointment to the new role was openly welcomed by Ofcom, where executives feel a number of key policy areas have now reached a point where they require urgent government action. </p> <p>But it is likely to be viewed with some trepidation by the BBC, which has been fighting a public battle with the regulator over the idea of potentially using the so-called \"surplus\" licence fee to fund a looming funding crisis among its public-service rivals. </p> <p>\"We're very good at this stuff in this country. The things that drive us mad because the tubes are crowded are actually rather good if you're looking at networks. You've got highly dense populations in a relatively small geography. Network density is a good thing. That's one of the reasons why we have such a rich free-to-air broadcast heritage,\" said Carter, who is also the former UK chief executive of the cable company NTL. </p> <p>\"English is an advantage, let's not underestimate that, and we're a nation of wordsmiths and creative people. We're as good at the poetry as we are at the pipes,\" he said. \"There is an opportunity to take an international lead as the major economy in the world that is seen as a leading powerhouse in and across these industries.\"</p> <p>While he was at Ofcom, broadcasters would sometimes complain that Carter was more concerned with building broadband networks than with safeguarding the future of public-service broadcasting. But he said last week that the two must go hand in hand. </p> <p>\"These are all important questions. But I always think it depends on how you come at them,\" he said. \"If the first question you ask is how to preserve regional news on broadcast television, that feels a pretty narrow way of entering the discussion. But that doesn't mean you can't enter it in a broader way and ask what it means for those things.\" </p> <p>He added: \"I have spent nearly 10 years of my life working in and around this subject. I think broadband is commercially, socially, culturally, economically and politically transforming. </p> <p>\"You have to look at the issues the other way around. We are now at a point where we have to get that right, or we might end up preserving the past.\" </p> <p>Carter said that after years of debate and discussion on issues such as public-service broadcasting, the time had come for decisions to be made. His conclusions will fall into three \"baskets\": some that can be enacted immediately; others that require modest legislation that can be pushed through before a general election, and other longer-term issues that will have to wait until after 2010.</p>",
  "<p>It was more like a battlefield than a football pitch at times as Stoke City subjected Juande Ramos and his players to as uncomfortable an afternoon as it is possible to imagine at this level. Having arrived in search of a remedy for their malaise, Tottenham departed battered and bruised after a compelling encounter which saw the visitors finish with nine men, concede two penalties, suffer a potentially serious injury and, most crucially of all, succumb to another defeat that leaves them anchored to the foot of the table.</p> <p>There was polite applause for Ramos from the travelling fans who had remained behind at the final whistle but so desperate is Tottenham's predicament that it will surely be only a matter of time before sections of the support turn. Encouragement could be taken from the manner in which Spurs responded to the setback of Gareth Bale's dismissal and the spot-kick Danny Higginbotham eventually converted but from the interval onwards Stoke were in total control and deserved their second league win of the season.</p> <p>The margin of victory might even have been more convincing but, after Jonathan Woodgate upended the lively Tom Soares in injury-time, Ricardo Fuller crashed a penalty against both uprights before Rory Delap smashed the rebound against the crossbar. By then, however, there had long been a suspicion that the game was up for Spurs, a belief that was reinforced in the ninth minute of the 11 that were added on when the substitute Michael Dawson recklessly lunged at Mamady Sidibe and received a straight red card. </p> <p>Dawson was the second Spurs central defender to leave the field, with Vedran Corluka having earlier departed on a stretcher after a collision involving his own goalkeeper, Heurelho Gomes, and Fuller. Play was held up for around six minutes before the Croatian was placed in a neck brace, given an oxygen mask and taken to hospital in an ambulance. It was an unfortunate incident that was in keeping with a full-blooded contest as Tony Pulis encouraged his players to bombard the Spurs area through just about any legal means possible.</p> <p>There is no more potent weapon than Rory Delap's long throw-in but, while the tactic threatened to bring reward for Stoke, it was a tap-in at the far post that provided the midfielder with his most vital contribution. Sidibe was the architect, the striker escaping on the right flank, after Stoke had for once resisted the temptation to go route one, before swinging a cross into the six-yard box that Delap, unmarked at the far post after Alan Hutton had been sucked towards the ball, side-footed into the net. </p> <p>There were still 37 minutes of normal time remaining but the zest, determination and courage that accompanied Tottenham's performance in the final half-hour of the first half had now disappeared. Luka Modric blazed over from the edge of the penalty area after Ibrahima Sonko lost his footing at the most inopportune time and Darren Bent, who had earlier equalised after bundling home despite straying into an offside position, enjoyed a brief sight of goal in the 90th minute but these were rare excursions into the Stoke half. </p> <p>In truth the portents had not been promising for Tottenham from as early as the 16th minute when Thomas Sorensen, who had to be withdrawn in the second half after Hutton's late challenge left him requiring stitches above the eye, punted upfield and Bale failed to control Dave Kitson's flick-on. The ball pinballed between the Welshman's legs before Soares stole a yard on the full-back and was brought down as he tore into the penalty area. Lee Mason, the referee, had little option but to show a red card. </p> <p>Higginbotham had the task of inflicting further punishment, something he managed to do but not before the blustery conditions required him to respot the ball four times. Mindful of those circumstances, the former Sunderland defender merited praise for his nerveless execution. Tottenham, however, were galvanised for a period, with Bent's leveller prefacing the visitors' best spell of the game as Stoke, somewhat embarrassingly given their numerical advantage, forlornly chased the ball. </p> <p>Yet half-time proved to be more than just an interruption to proceedings as Spurs lost their way and Stoke found their rhythm. Indeed, when Delap struck Stoke's second, the game had turned on its head and thereafter the question seemed to be not whether Spurs could salvage an equaliser but how long it would be before Stoke added a third. Fuller came the closest, the Jamaican hitting the woodwork twice with his penalty.</p> <p>Not that the Stoke fans were left disappointed. \"You're getting sacked in the morning,\" they taunted as Ramos faced up to a sixth defeat in eight league matches that ensures he has left an indelible mark on Tottenham's history, with the sequence representing the club's worst ever start to a league season. With matches against Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City to come, following Sunday's game against Bolton, there is a sense that things could become worse before they get better. It is quite a thought for Spurs fans to digest. </p> <p><strong>Man of the match:</strong> Tom Soares (Stoke)</p>",

  "<p>Speculation was mounting yesterday about the health of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-il, after two newspapers in Japan reported that the regime was poised to issue an \"important message\".</p> <p>The Sankei Shimbun, a rightwing broadsheet, quoted an unidentified Japanese defence ministry official as saying \"an announcement of important information will be made on October 20\".</p> <p>The report did not provide details, but analysts believe the announcement could pertain to Kim's health, relations with South Korea or even a coup against the \"Dear Leader.\" Others suggested the message could be less dramatic, such as the launch of an economic policy or a reshuffle in the Korean Workers' party.</p> <p>The Yomiuri Shimbun said at the weekend that North Korean diplomats had been instructed not to leave their embassies and to remain on standby for an important announcement. The right-leaning Yomiuri, which quoted multiple unnamed sources, said the instruction had been sent out over the past few days.</p> <p>Speculation that Kim, 66, is seriously ill intensified after he disappeared from public view in mid-August, failing even to attend a parade to mark the country's 60th anniversary on September 9.</p> <p>South Korean and US officials said Kim had suffered a stroke and undergone brain surgery. North Korea, however, insists there is nothing wrong with his health.</p> <p>Earlier this month the Korean Central News Agency, the regime's mouthpiece, released unverified reports that Kim had attended a football match. But doubt has been cast on the authenticity of photographs released last week purporting to show a healthy Kim inspecting a military unit.

  "<p>The mood inside the bus is grave. It is just before 3am. The passengers - burdened with suitcases, cardboard boxes, cloth bundles and flasks of green tea - have the air of prisoners of war being transported to an uncertain fate. </p> <p>\"When you're on the bus, you don't talk with the people you don't know in case they're with the Taliban,\" said 19-year-old Asadullah, an electronic spare parts dealer who, like many Afghans, uses only one name. </p> <p>Asadullah and his fellow 55 passengers are taking a ride along the 483-km highway that many believe is the most dangerous stretch of road on the planet. Linking Kandahar and Kabul - Afghanistan's two largest and most economically vital cities - and completed almost five years ago, the road was meant to open a gateway to economic development and improve the quality of life for Afghans. </p> <p>The US state department touted the $190m (\u00a3110m) project as \"the most visible sign of America's post-war reconstruction\" in Afghanistan. But today the road is a symbol of instability across the country, the failure of government and international security forces to maintain law and order, and the increasing presence of the Taliban. </p> <p>Government and military officials say insurgents and bandits regularly pull travellers from their vehicles, murdering or kidnapping them for ransoms. Corrupt government security forces seek bribes and collaborate with insurgents and robbers. Roadside bombs frequently target Afghan police and military patrols, along with Nato convoys. No one in an official capacity can even quantify the violence. </p> <p>\"I have to take these risks,\" said Asadullah, who makes the treacherous journey between Kabul and Kandahar once a month. \"I have to make money to buy food for my family.\"</p> <p>Afghans unable to afford the $100 one-way airfare between Kabul and Kandahar pay an average of $6 for the bus ride. They hope the bus will be safer than travelling in private vehicles, which are favoured targets of the Taliban and highwaymen. </p> <p>Responsibility for security along the highway initially was handed to Afghanistan's national police, but shortages of men and weaponry, and the recent increase in violence along the road have forced the government to deploy military units as reinforcements. The road is littered with burned-out green police pick-up trucks, 4x4 vehicles, Nato supply trucks and demolished bridges. </p> <p>General Abdul Alim Kohistani, the regional police commander who oversees the territory, said he has 180 men to man the 14 checkpoints along the route. He added that he needs at least 320 more officers and heavier firepower to provide adequate security.</p> <p>\"The Taliban has RPGs [rocket propelled grenades] and mortars. How can we fight them when we only have PKs, AK-47s, and fewer men?\" Kohistani asked, referring to the machine guns and rifles his men carry. \"We want to take control of this highway and show the world and the Afghan people that we are capable of doing this.\" The army now has a base near the midpoint between Kabul and Kandahar and has established 15 checkpoints with at least 40 to 50 soldiers at each one. </p> <p>Defence ministry spokesman General Zaher Azimi said that manning checkpoints on the highway is a policing job and the army is already hard-pressed with other duties. But the military has no alternative because \"instability is increasing day-by-day\". While careful not to criticise the police force, Azimi says if he were in charge of security along the highway he would \"pursue the insurgents into the surrounding areas off the road to capture or push them as far back as possible\". </p> <p>Faizullah, president of Abduli International Transport, said Taliban operatives regularly call his office and ask who has bought tickets. \"They're looking for foreigners and people working with the government,\" Faizullah said. \"We tell them we only sell tickets to normal Afghan civilians.\" That doesn't prevent the Taliban from frequently stopping and boarding buses along the highway, according to drivers and passengers. \"They search and question everyone on the bus,\" said driver Agha Mohammed, 35. \"Sometimes they take two or three people off.\" Drivers tend to hurtle their buses down the narrow two-lane road, rarely voluntarily stopping for passengers. Despite their efforts to keep moving, the drivers said they have no choice when the Taliban appear. </p> <p>\"I must stop or they'll start shooting,\" said 34-year-old Toryalai, who drives between Kabul and Kandahar four times a week for the Abduli bus line and earns the equivalent of about $140 a month. </p> <p>In another show of force, the Taliban have coerced mobile phone companies to shut down their signals along the highway at night after fulfilling threats to start destroying communication towers in the region, according to an employee of one of the firms, Roshan. </p> <p>In a sandy, pockmarked terminal in Kabul later that morning, the relieved group disembarks. \"It was a good trip,\" says Abdul Nabi, 36, a trader who was visiting family, as he whisked away his wife and four children. \"We arrived in one piece.\"</p>",

In fact an arrangement has now been made so that Channel Five will be received in all parts of the UK and S4C in all parts of Wales.</p> <p> </p> <p>The culture secretary, Andy Burnham, has been accused of neglecting 2.5 million households in rural areas after it emerged they would get less than half the number of TV channels broadcast to the rest of Britain after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/digital-switchover\">switch to digital services</a>. </p> <p>Opposition MPs believe the government is discriminating against rural communities because ministers have refused to make sure that all the broadcasters using the digital service Freeview offer a full service for every home, once the analogue television signal is finally switched off in 2012.</p> <p>The problem is most keenly felt in the Borders TV region, which covers southern Scotland, Cumbria and parts of Northumberland. </p> <p>The area will be visited by Burnham next month when it becomes the first region in the UK to lose analogue channels with its main transmitter at Selkirk switched over to Freeview's digital television service.</p> <p>The latest figures from Digital UK, the agency set up to oversee the switchover, show that half of Borders TV viewers will only receive 19 of the 48 free channels otherwise available to nearly every town and city in the UK after switchover. </p> <p>The local Liberal Democrat MP, Michael Moore, said it meant rural viewers were getting \"Freeview lite\" and followed the controversial decision by ITV and Ofcom to cut regional news and current affairs coverage, and allow Border TV's news to merge with Tyne-Tees. </p> <p>\"This is excluding large chunks of the country - it's a very bad principle to establish,\" he said. \"There's a principle here, that people in rural Britain are somehow allowed to be second class citizens. To some people this may seem a relatively small issue but it's symbolic of a wider issue - the neglect of rural Britain by this government.\"</p> <p>The channels these homes will fail to get include all Channel 5 services, FilmFour, Sky News, the entertainment channel Dave, shopping channels, Eurosport, CITV and the Welsh and Gaelic language channels most watched in rural areas. Nor can they sign up for subscription channels UKTV Gold and Setanta Sports.</p> <p>Moore said Ofcom, the broadcasting regulator, had confirmed that about 2.5m homes across the UK would get a reduced service, covering roughly 6 million people. That worsened the sense of discrimination and isolation felt by rural communities which are also losing local post offices, telephone boxes, bank branches and public transport services. </p> <p>Mark Williams, Lib Dem MP for Ceredigion in west Wales, said his Welsh-language constituents would lose S4C, while a few constituents would still receive no terrestrial television service. \"This is a great worry. </p> <p>\"It's a great technological advance, and it's more choice, but let's not kid ourselves, we're going to have a two- or even three-tier service.\" </p> <p>Nearly all rural areas will encounter the same problems when they switch over, because they rely on relay transmitters for their television signal. </p> <p>The broadcasters and ministers argue it is uneconomic to install booster equipment in every relay station, and insist rural communities will still get a strong package of channels by public service broadcasters, including all BBC channels and nearly all ITV and Channel 4 services. In the West Country, Meridian, Wales, Yorkshire and Ulster television regions between 34% and 43% of viewers will get the reduced service, while the national average suggests more than a quarter of homes will not get the complete package. </p> <p>A Digital UK spokesman said this would improve as more transmitters switched off their analogue signals. </p> <p>That would make more spectrum available for digital television signals so eventually 90% of households would get a full service. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport said: \"Digital switchover brings great benefits for viewers in terms of increased choice. After switchover, 98.5% of viewers will have access to around 20 channels from public service broadcasters - this is a substantial increase on those available through terrestrial television. </p> <p>\"It is a commercial matter for the commercial operators whether they extend their coverage beyond 90%, not a matter for government.\"</p> <h2>Not for country folk</h2> <p>Some of the channels rural viewers will miss:</p> <p><strong>FilmFour</strong> - Movies such as Brokeback Mountain; Judge Dredd; Elizabeth</p> <p><strong>Channel Five</strong> - Trisha Goddard (above); Neighbours; Law and Order; Home &amp; Away</p> <p><strong>Sky News </strong>- 24-hour news (below)</p> <p><strong>CITV </strong>- Spongebob Squarepants; Dora the Explorer; Art Attack; Horrid Henry</p> <p><strong>Dave </strong>- re-runs of The Mighty Boosh (left); Top Gear; Have I Got News For You; QI</p> <p><strong>S4C -</strong> Welsh language news and drama</p>",
  "<p>In announcing her plans to move substantial elements of BBC production out of London - Casualty to Wales, Weakest Link to Scotland, Chelsea Flower Show to Birmingham, and religion to Northern Ireland - the director of BBC Vision, Jana Bennett, was keen to stress the fundamental nature of the changes taking place. This was about \"permanently increasing the production and commissioning of programmes in other parts of the country\" and \"changing the very DNA of the BBC\". Bennett was right. This is a genuine attempt to overcome the concentration of BBC creative resources in and around London; originally seen as the source of the corporation's creative prowess, this is now seen as its achilles heel. Reversing this trend is now key to winning a decent settlement in the next licence fee negotiations and, critically, its next charter.</p> <p>Bennett talked of building on existing specialisms, creative renewal and sustainability. But behind the rhetoric are targets which should be read in terms of political and economic impact. By 2016, 50% of BBC production will be out of London; of which 17% will be from the nations, with 9% from Scotland specifically so as to match its share of the UK's population. Wales and Northern Ireland are also slated for shares of licence fee cash to match their relative sizes. And despite Bennett's talk of different centres being based on historic specialisms, all of them have been identified as centres of excellence in drama, factual, comedy and entertainment. It is difficult to avoid the slightly cynical view that for political benefits to flow uninterrupted, no region can be seen as being denied the chance to shine in any of the key programme genres. Whether they do or not, of course, is a completely different question. </p> <p>When it comes to the English regions, the picture is more closely related to existing patterns of network output, with Birmingham's daytime and factual focus and Bristol's drama and natural history. The BBC's hope is that the MediaCity development in Salford - another centre scheduled for pretty much the whole suite of drama, comedy, factual, children's etc - will be enough to keep everyone else quiet. But once you start promoting commissioning and production policies in terms of job creation and economic impact - as both the BBC and Channel 4 do - you run the risk of being pulled hither and thither in order to maintain the political consensus (and a decent licence fee settlement). And surely once the BBC commits \"to spread the licence fee more equitably\", it is only a matter of time before Yorkshire, say, which has a population roughly the size of Scotland's, demands its share.</p> <p>In any case, do Bennett's plans go far enough? The big move to Salford offered a historic opportunity to get to grips with the BBC's London-centricity. But the failure to move a major, mainstream TV channel as part of the package betrays an underlying determination by London-based powerbrokers to hang on to control. </p> <p>Last week Bennett announced \"commissioning executives\" to be created and distributed around the UK - but they will all report to London-based bosses and channel controllers, who are where real power firmly remains. </p> <p>So dispersed production might be enough to spike Alex Salmond's devolutionary guns and create enough of a political consensus to see the BBC through some of the challenges ahead. But political consensus is not the same as public esteem, and if the BBC is not a brilliant broadcaster then no one's going to care where its programmes were made. </p> <p>\u00b7 Steve Hewlett presents The Media Show on Radio 4</p>",
  "<p>The Ospreys were expected to be among the high fliers in the Heineken Cup but they have yet to start flapping, failing to score a try in their first two games.</p> <p>Wales's leading region may mix the bulk of the national side with a supplement of Test players from overseas, but having signed up an array of individual talent, the management keeps banging on about the overriding importance of the team ethic. The directors' programme notes on Saturday were stuffed with corporate jargon, clotted with words such as core, values, transparency, honesty, trust and loyalty.</p> <p>The aim is to establish an esprit de corps, but there is no joie de vivre. Players who are expressive for Wales seem constrained, lacking swagger. There were mitigating factors against Perpignan, with a number of backs injured and opponents happy to concede penalties. But even when they had a man advantage, on three occasions, the Ospreys lacked invention.</p> <p>Like Wales they are run by a New Zealander, but while Warren Gatland is the head coach at national level, Andrew Hore has an overseeing role at the Ospreys and comes from a conditioning background, rather than coaching. He has built a model of rigidity, exemplified in the two-match ban given to Gavin Henson this month for skipping a training session. Henson's ban ended early when he was recalled to the bench on Saturday morning after a back spasm forced out James Hook. The Ospreys did not have another fit and registered back but Henson remained on the sidelines throughoutthe match, even though his side only took the lead for the first time with 11 minutes to go.</p> <p>Perpignan led for 22 minutes either side of half-time, after J\u00e9r\u00f4me Porical kicked his third penalty, despite losing two players to the sin-bin in the third quarter, which reduced them to 13 men for two minutes. In stoppage time Viliami Vaki crossed the line for what would have been the winning try, only to be called back for a forward pass.</p> <p>The Ospreys prop Paul James was fortunate to remain on the field after flooring the Romanian hooker Marius Tincu with a punch, while the home coach, Sean Holley, was concerned at marks around the eyes of some of his players. \"It is the second week in a row this has happened,\" he said, in a reference to the 12-6 defeat at Leicester. \"I am not saying it is eye-gouging, but it is something that has increased in the game in the last year or so.\"</p> <p>At one point, the Ospreys captain, Ryan Jones, pointed at his eyes and looked at the referee after the replacement lock Ian Gough had, as it were, pointed the finger at the flanker Gerrie Britz for skulduggery at a ruck. Was Jones suggesting the referee needed to see an optician or that Gough had been gouged? \"No comment,\" he said, repeatedly.</p> <p>The Ospreys need to pull their collective finger out. Five penalties from the 19-year-old fly-half Dan Biggar secured victory here, but the virtually silent reaction from the crowd at the final whistle told its own story. They have in Holley probably the most enterprising young coach in Wales, but he does not wield the clout of Gatland in a top-heavy region.</p> <p><strong>Ospreys:</strong> Byrne; Vaughton, Bowe, A Bishop, Williams; Biggar, Webb; James (D Jones, 53), Bennett (Hibbard, 75), A Jones, <br>AW Jones (Gough, 72), Evans, R Jones (capt; Smith, 80), Holah, Tiatia.</p> <p><strong>Pens:</strong> Biggar 5.</p> <p><strong>Perpignan</strong> Porical; Plante, Sid, Manas, Candelon; M\u00e9l\u00e9 (Durand, 11), Cusiter; Freshwater (Pulu, 59), Tincu (Guirado, 59), Mas (capt; Freshwater, 70), Olibeau (Guiry, 62), Kairelis (Vilaceca, 59), Perez (Vaki, 73), Britz, Chouly.</p> <p><strong>Pens:</strong> Porical 3.<br><strong>Sin-bin:</strong> Plante, 29; Perez, 40; Vilaceca, 76.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> W Barnes (England). <strong>Attendance:</strong> 10,761.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea\">Chelsea</a> lacked some players, but they brought the full force of their reputation to Teesside. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/middlesbrough\">Middlesbrough</a> quaked, as if their own turf were hostile territory. Victory becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy when the opposition is sure it will be beaten. While Luiz Felipe Scolari's league leaders are a treat to watch, there is also a pragmatic benefit when rivals are incapacitated by the dread of embarrassment.</p> <p>Middlesbrough had beaten Chelsea, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchesterunited\">Manchester United</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal\">Arsenal</a> at the Riverside over the course of the previous three seasons. On Saturday, though, the only side convinced of a tough time to come was Gareth Southgate's. \"I was concerned after three or four minutes because we didn't seem to have the energy and verve to go and chase the ball,\" he said. The booing of some fans following the interval only faded when they walked out early. Southgate called it \"understandable\".</p> <p>It is an immutable law that no player is ever deemed quite so good on the pitch as he is when suspended or injured, but the Middlesbrough manager had reason to pine for Emanuel Pogatetz, Robert Huth, Justin Hoyte and Tuncay Sanli. Southgate had a starting line-up with an average age of 23 that did not have brashness to offset the inexperience.</p> <p>Chelsea, presented with timid opponents, were quite wonderful. When asked if this drubbing sent out a message to rivals, the manager replied that the important statement was the one addressed to him. Those who took the place of the many absentees are intent on staying in the first team.</p> <p>Juliano Belletti, for example, had been outstanding as an attacking midfielder long before he scored the second with a bending 30-yarder. The roll call of unavailable players, including Petr Cech, Ricardo Carvalho and Didier Drogba, sounded like the shortlist for a prestigious award, but they were never missed. If Chelsea do still count on one person it is Frank Lampard.</p> <p>He is running games nowadays, and also kept his goal tally ticking over when heading Chelsea into a 4-0 lead from Salomon Kalou's perfect cross. The Ivorian appears to be flourishing under Scolari's tutelage.</p> <p>The manager could be seen gesturing to Kalou that he must shift to a narrower position on the right, presumably because he would otherwise be in the flightpath of the full-back Jose Bosingwa as he takes off down the wing. Chelsea's movement and interplay is at an uncannily high level.</p> <p>It rests on technique as much as instruction. Players are calling for the ball in tight situations because they know they can complete a pass under pressure. Middlesbrough, like others before them, have been incapable of closing down Scolari's Chelsea because there are far too many opponents to be targeted. \"Even when you try to press them and work them, their individual technical ability allows them to play their way out of trouble,\" said Southgate.</p> <p>The home side were terribly vulnerable on their right, where Jonathan Grounds, a left-back by preference, had to deputise for Hoyte. Wayne Bridge crossed from that flank in the 14th minute and David Wheater's clearing header was indecisive. Belletti's shot then deflected into the path of Kalou, who finished easily.</p> <p>The scorer's other goal came at the heart of a spell in which Chelsea beat Ross Turnbull three times in 12 minutes. Another excellent ball from Bridge was laid back by Florent Malouda and Kalou's drive broke off the chest of a woebegone Wheater en route to the net. The visitors halted the drubbing after the 67th minute, when Turnbull had spilt a Nicolas Anelka attempt on to the post and Malouda tucked in the loose ball.</p> <p>By normal reckoning, Chelsea should be handicapped by shortage of established strikers. Anelka, though, has remained fit and, in addition to five goals in this campaign, his runs have opened gaps for others. Scolari sees some hope of Didier Drogba being available for next Sunday's home match against Liverpool, who are level on points with the leaders.</p> <p>In the past an emphasis has been put on the muscle and height that make him a good target man, but the player also has a broad range of skills and Scolari might release him from stereotypes. Everyone at the club is enjoying a kind of freedom. </p> <p>John Terry normally savours feats of blood-soaked resistance, but he enthuses over Scolari's policy. \"Today,\" said the defender, \"was one of the best displays I have ever seen us put in. He wants us to play from the back.\" For a moment, the centre-back laid down his warrior mentality. Someone mentioned Scolari's claim that the captain would \"die for the cause\". Terry can currently scoff at the macho talk. \"I don't know about that,\" he said. \"My missus wouldn't be too pleased.\"<br><strong><br>Man of the match:</strong> Frank Lampard</p> <p>The England midfielder now seems to have a broader range to his repertoire as he revels in the expansive philosophy of Luiz Felipe Scolari</p> <p><strong>Best moment</strong> He did take time off from controlling the midfield to make one of those well-judged runs that led to him scoring with an angled header</p> <h2>Strength in reserve: Second-choice stars</h2> <p>Chelsea's mauling of Middlesbrough on Saturday was characterised by some particularly impressive performances from some of their less celebrated players</p> <p><strong>Carlo Cudicini </strong></p> <p>The Italian has long been described as a goalkeeper who would be first choice for most other clubs and, while a timid Middlesbrough gave him little to worry about at the Riverside, he produced a blemish-free performance</p> <p><strong>Wayne Bridge </strong></p> <p>Ashley Cole's deputy at left-back has not always had the easiest of times at Chelsea but, buoyed by a winning appearance for England against Belarus in midweek, Bridge played a significant part in two of Chelsea's goals against Boro and revelled in the freedom generated by his side's attacking style </p> <p><strong>Alex </strong></p> <p>The Brazilian was imperious at the centre of Chelsea's defence alongside a still vulnerable John Terry, the captain still recovering from injury. Certainly looked capable of challenging Ricardo Carvalho for his place</p> <p><strong>Juliano Belletti</strong></p> <p>The Brazilian was signed by Chelsea as a full-back but excelled in place of Michael Ballack in midfield at the Riverside, his stunning long-range goal shortly after half-time capping an excellent attacking display. After an indifferent first season at Stamford Bridge, he appears to be growing in stature under Luiz Felipe Scolari</p> <p><strong>Salomon Kalou </strong></p> <p>The Ivorian forward has been used sparingly by Scolari so far but demonstrated his worth in style on Saturday, scoring two goals and setting up another for Frank Lampard, whom he rivalled as man of the match. Another player who looks like he could flourish under the Brazilian manager's more expansive playing methods</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewishamilton\">Lewis Hamilton's</a> win yesterday may not have been one of his most spectacular victories but it was significant in terms of overcoming setbacks and winning the drivers' championship. Seven days on from a disastrous race in Japan, Hamilton's dominant performance in Shanghai was the perfect antidote which sees the McLaren driver go to the final race at Interlagos with a seven-point lead over Ferrari's Felipe Massa. Even if the Brazilian wins his home race on November 2, Hamilton only needs to finish in the top five to secure his first title. \"We know what we have to do,\" said Hamilton. \"We will use a similar approach to this weekend.\"</p> <p>Hamilton had to overcome a barrage of criticism following a first-lap incident in Japan. The Englishman was accused of aggressive driving when a poor start led him to run wide at the first corner and take several drivers with him. He was under pressure not to repeat the mistake yesterday when, once again, he started from pole with the Ferrari of Kimi Raikkonen alongside. </p> <p>Hamilton made a perfect getaway and began to demoralise the pursuing Ferraris by gradually pulling away. As has become the norm, it took the Ferraris longer to get their tyres up to working temperature but, once fully up to speed, Raikkonen could not reduce the six-second gap.</p> <p>\"When my car got better, he [Hamilton] had already pulled away,\" said Raikkonen. \"OK, I lost time in traffic, but we just didn't have the speed today. We were missing a few tenths [of a second] and there was nothing I could do.\"</p> <p>The McLaren-Mercedes had the measure of the Ferraris from the start of practice on Friday, Hamilton making the most of his advantage with another brilliant lap to take pole position, his seventh of the season. Once he had managed his start and safely negotiated the first sequence of corners, Hamilton then focused on producing a succession of near-perfect laps.</p> <p>\"From Friday, we knew we had the pace,\" said Hamilton. \"I was very happy with the balance of the car and I was able to extract the most from the tyres. Both types of tyre were very competitive and consistent. I was able to push when I needed to and it was great to be able to open a gap in the early stages.\"</p> <p>Hamilton led by 6.6 seconds at the first of two pit stops, the McLaren driver extending his advantage to more than 10 seconds as Raikkonen turned his attention to his team-mate. Massa had struggled throughout qualifying and his troubles continued in the race. </p> <p>\"Today was very difficult to follow this guy [Hamilton] and fight with him,\" said Massa. \"Our car works in a different way [from the McLaren]. There was no grip and it was difficult to drive. I had some wheel-spin at the start but I could see that Lewis was stronger. He was able to pull out a couple of tenths [of a second] a lap and that made his race more comfortable. I had to drive on the limit to try and reduce the gap but it just was not possible, Lewis had a better car for the whole weekend. That's the way it seems to be this season. Our car works well on some circuits but not on others and for this race we're not really sure why that was.\"</p> <p>Although team orders are not allowed, Raikkonen had no hesitation in taking the law into his own hands. With eight laps remaining, the Finn repaid Massa who had given up victory in Brazil last year to allow Raikkonen the result he needed to beat Hamilton to the championship by a single point. By moving into second place yesterday, Massa scored eight points instead of six.</p> <p>\"I'm not in a position to challenge for the championship and I know what the team expects from me,\" said Raikkonen. \"I'm happy to achieve the maximum points for the team. It doesn't make any difference to me.\"</p> <p>When asked for his opinion on Raikkonen's assistance, Hamilton said he would expect the same should he find himself in a similar position behind his team-mate, Heikki Kovalainen. The Finn, who had never been in a position to help Hamilton, retired with engine trouble for the second race in succession. McLaren previously had not suffered engine problems since 2006. Hamilton is scheduled to use the same engine for the final race. If McLaren decide to change it in Brazil, Hamilton will receive a 10-place grid penalty.</p> <p>By finishing sixth yesterday, Robert Kubica lost an already slim chance of challenging for the championship, the Polish driver having struggled to make his BMW work. Fernando Alonso, the unexpected winner of the previous two races, finished fourth. Coupled with eighth place for Nelson Piquet, Alonso's recent competitive run has secured fourth place in the constructors' championship for Renault in their battle with Toyota. Timo Glock took seventh place in the sole-surviving Toyota after Jarno Trulli had been eliminated in a first-corner collision with the Toro Rosso of S\u00e9bastien Bourdais, the only incident in a race that was dull for everyone with the exception of the winner. </p> <p>\"All weekend we have had God on our side,\" said Hamilton. \"The team have done a phenomenal job preparing the car and making the steps forward. They made sure the car stayed intact so I could bring it home - and that's what I did.\"</p>",
  "<p>A few weeks ago speculation began as to what might be the novels of the credit crunch. Where was the F Scott Fitzgerald, John Steinbeck or Martin Amis of 2008, the novelist who could speak to this crazily chaotic economic age? On cue last week, Aravind Adiga wins the Booker for The White Tiger. The critics have been sniffy, referring to him with discernible disdain as a former journalist. (He was Asia business correspondent for Time magazine.) But he won precisely because of his ringside seat at globalisation's boom years; he won because, despite its possible shortcomings as a novel, his book nails the myth of a benign US economic hegemony that has \"lifted\" millions out of poverty across Asia. </p> <p>What it portrays in its place is horrific: a world where billions live in what Adiga's lead character describes as the \"Darkness\" - the abject poverty entrenched across swaths of rural and slum-city India. Meanwhile, an elite surfing on a tide of consumerism and cheap credit has been entirely dislocated from the majority of the country. This is a country where Bangalore's IT millionaires grow rich alongside an agrarian crisis characterised by an extraordinary phenomenon, the silent protests of 18,000 indebted farmers committing suicide every year - 200,000 in the past 12 years.</p> <p>Just as Steinbeck stirred the conscience of America with his novels on the dust bowl and the Great Depression, and Charles Dickens challenged the complacencies of Victorian Britain, so Adiga reads as a blistering critique of an economic system that can only be described as grotesque. The Indian economist Jayati Ghosh points out that Mumbai has the second biggest sales globally of Mercedes cars, yet more than half of India lives in poverty without enough to eat.</p> <p>The pertinence of Adiga's win is that India has been the poster boy for the past two decades of globalisation; Bono told me once that he dreamed of sub-Saharan Africa finding a way to emulate India's success. But its model of growth imported from the US was based on credit-fuelled consumerism for a fifth of the population while state investment in health, education, agriculture, infrastructure - crucial components of sustainable development - were cut back. Adiga's novel is a powerful volley in the crisis of legitimacy gripping the west's domination of the global economy. </p> <p>Europe and the US have spent the weekend talking of reform of global capitalism and a Bretton Woods II, but they need to start with a grovelling apology. In recent decades, they have used their power through the IMF to write the rules and impose them across the world by ruthless manipulation and bullying. Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have together more votes in the IMF than China, India and Brazil. </p> <p>In the past month, the US and Europe have been humiliated by the catastrophic failure of their own rules, and have been forced to rip them up. The double standards of western interests have been starkly exposed - their bail-outs are exactly what they have refused, repeatedly, to allow other countries to do in similar crises. </p> <p>Those who will pay the heaviest price for the foolhardiness of deregulated financial capitalism are among those who are least responsible, as Brazil's President Lula angrily pointed out last week. The shockwaves of the west's banking crisis will shipwreck more vulnerable countries. In developing countries, people don't have the resources - welfare provision, savings, insurance - to tide them over a crisis. Instead, they go hungry, homeless - and they die. Across Africa and Asia, countries are bracing themselves for multiple hits, with falls in aid already threatened and a likely decline in the remittances that buoy up their economies - in the UK, the immigration minister Phil Woolas is already signalling a harder line on immigration. Fear of global recession is bringing commodity prices down and will reduce the demand for luxury products such as flowers, green beans and hot holidays. The anger among developing countries will spread. Our worries about jobs and pensions pale in comparison with the fallout on the billions who will not be able to feed or educate their children. </p> <p>The western model of neoliberal financialisation was driven by clear self-interest, argues the Cambridge economist Ha-Joon Chang. The west couldn't compete in manufacturing (its labour costs are too high), so it turned to financial markets and used the cheapest way to make money: it offered loans, not for productive investment (factories, businesses) but to consumers, using their homes as collateral. Credit cards and small loans are particularly lucrative. So the west leaned heavily on countries through the World Trade Organisation and the IMF to open up their financial sectors. The western banks and the advertising companies piled in, and the result is a credit consumer boom. This may make a few people rich, but it is not, by any definition, development.</p> <p>Chang, South Korean by background, saw the bullying graphically illustrated in the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis. Not only did the US and the IMF stop the Asian countries from implementing a state bail-out, they took advantage of the desperate situation to force South Korea and other Asian nations to adopt further financial deregulation. Productive investment in South Korea has since halved and credit has boomed. Now the country is on economists' critical list as its stockmarket plunges. Ironically, it is only the countries lucky enough to have dodged IMF bullying who are relatively safe in the current maelstrom: leftwing political groups in India closed ranks to protect its banking sector from the worst deregulation. </p> <p>For most developing countries, the moral of the 1997-98 Asian crisis was that a primary purpose of financial management was to ensure sufficient capital reserves to avoid ever being vulnerable to the IMF thugs in their pinstripe suits. India, Korea, China: all have huge foreign reserves, often in US treasury bonds. It is the safest form of insurance in a global economy in which the flows of foreign exchange are so huge they can destroy a currency in of hours. But for a developing country to tie up most of its capital abroad is ruinously expensive; this capital should be invested in the country's own development - roads, for example, and schools to produce engineers, scientists and IT technicians. </p> <p>Once again, who benefits from this absurdity of the global financial system? The west - in particular the US, whose current account deficit is funded by the sacrificed futures of millions across Asia. Chang's thesis, in his book Bad Samaritans - Guilty Secrets of Rich Nations and the Threat to Global Prosperity, is that the west has effectively kicked away the ladder that enabled it to achieve prosperity. It denies to developing countries the protection and the investment in industries that were essential to its own development. </p> <p>At its most stark, the analysis is that the west has had a vested interest in keeping wage levels down in developing countries while making money from offering cheap credit. All it had to do was enlist a collaborating elite in each country to implement the deal, which was clearly not in the interests of the bulk of the population. Neoliberal globalisation was a system that ensured the rich got richer and the poor got poorer.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:m.bunting@theguardian.com\">m.bunting@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>On my way to Monte Carlo to interview Max Mosley, people seem very concerned about what is appropriate to wear. Are you wearing boots, a friend asks, as if Mosley, the tabloids' favourite ogre, pervert and owner of Britain's most famous spanked bottom, might leap up and crack a whip at any moment. </p> <p>Since the News of the World's hidden-camera expos\u00e9 of a five-hour sadomasochistic session with five paid women in a flat in Chelsea, Mosley's life has been plagued by the footage that showed him naked, being thrashed and then whipping several women before, still naked, having a cup of tea with them. At 68, the formula one boss and son of the British fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley and Hitler-admirer Diana Mitford, found himself on the front page under the headline \"F1 boss has sick Nazi orgy with 5 hookers\". To everyone's surprise, he went to court for gross invasion of his privacy, braving more details that emerged, including the sensitivity of his bottom and his predilection for having it shaved. The judge found absolutely no elements of a Nazi theme or mocking of the Holocaust, dismissing the suggestion that a head-lice test or striped outfits had concentration-camp overtones. Mosley won a record \u00a360,000 damages, in a ruling that could impact on press freedom. But his media battle has only just begun. </p> <p>Sitting in his Monaco office, with its sweeping seaview, the head of one of the world's most expensive sports looks out over one of the most moneyed places on earth. But Mosley knows that the whole world now is mostly thinking about his buttocks, and he doesn't really mind the jokes. He doesn't look his age, as he reaches to fit his hearing aid: \"I can hear men perfectly but I can't hear women - it's all to do with frequencies.\" He has the calm, smiling resignation of someone who has nowhere left to hide. Occasionally blushing, he is very frank. He has practised sadomasochism all his adult life, sees nothing wrong with it when it's legal and consensual, feels he was born like that and accepts he will never change. But admitting this can never make up for the impact the revelations have had on his wife of 48 years, Jean, a policeman's daughter whom he met and married at Oxford, and their two grown-up sons, who had no idea about his secret life. </p> <p>Over the summer holidays, amid the pain of the family fallout, rather than retreat from the spotlight, he resolved to go further in his \"war\" for justice. Through the European court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, he wants to cement a law on privacy in Britain whereby editors will be forced to contact the subject of their revelations before publishing. Some say this will muzzle journalism. He says it's about curbing the tabloid frenzy to destroy people's lives over eccentric sex. \"The government has got something to answer for, for allowing this Murdoch culture.\" </p> <p>Sadomasochism has been such a regular part of Mosley's life for decades that when he first saw the News of the World's scoop in March, he couldn't at first work out when they had shot the footage. Then he recognised what he prefers to call \"the party\". </p> <p>\"The Nazi element - that to me was barking mad. There was never a thought or a hint of such a thing. And it was never in my mind. I would have found it the opposite end of the scale from erotic, particularly because of my antecedents,\" he says. The alleged SS inspection manual was in fact a page torn out of an exercise book. \"And to talk about it being a concentration camp scenario when the opening words of the woman were, 'Welcome to Chelsea', and she was Officer Smith and I was Mr Barnes ...\" </p> <p>Mosley had already done his soul-searching about his preference for S&amp;M long ago. And although he continued to practise it throughout his years as a working lawyer, his career in motor sport and as part of the formula one governing body, he doesn't think it was in any way reckless. \"I've been doing it for 45 years, I've been extremely careful, I'd never got caught.\" He has known the women at this particular \"party\" for around two to three years. One was German, and he now knows she would have been \"mortally offended\" by any Nazi themes. \"One of the girls ... might easily have been Jewish,\" he adds. He feels the News of the World thought they were \"Lithuanian drug addicts or something of that kind\" but they were all graduates whom he describes as \"intelligent and competent\"; one has nearly finished her PhD. He rented the flat and paid them, but says they took part in administering and receiving beatings because they liked it. </p> <p>The descriptions of them as \"hookers\" or prostitutes is wrong, he feels. \"First of all, all those women sometimes do what they did for nothing, just for the fun of it. And even with me, on at least two or three occasions, they've done it for nothing. It's what they do. Of course, they utterly resent the description of hooker because for them, that [sadomasochism] and sex are two different things. Clearly there's a sexual element, but there's a sexual element when an actress kisses an actor on screen, but she's not a prostitute. It's a different thing: to them it's acting; sex is something different. So they don't see it as prostitution and I agree with them. The legal definition you could argue about, but morally they are not prostitutes.\" </p> <p>He says the details of the scenario were made up by the \"ladies\". He found the inspection for head lice and the medical examination unerotic and quite boring but it would have been rude to stop the game and tell them that. \"You tend to leave it to them. Really, all I'd said beforehand is we'll have one part of the thing with me as what they call 'sub' [submissive] and one part with me 'dom' [dominant]. And they were quite happy with that because they all switch as well, so it just works for everybody. As soon as you stand back from it, it's completely mad, but that's how it worked.\" </p> <p>The prison scenario was quite mundane. \"The reason they did the medical thing on me, they told me afterwards, is that they'd tried it on some sub and he'd found it tremendous. So, you know, they were just being nice.\" </p> <p>Mosley says it's a \"matter of principle\" that people should be allowed to do what they like as long as it's legal and consensual. He doesn't believe in an \"old-fashioned\", puritanical view that someone \"whose sex life isn't quite the same as the majority\" should have to resign from their job. </p> <p>But he kept it private, I say, away from the people who shared his life. \"To anyone who's not into it, it's an absurd activity. Like, for example, being a transvestite is absurd to anybody who's not into it. Therefore if you are into it you keep it secret from people who are not into it, and that could include your family.\"</p> <p>In formula one circles, he has a rule that people are allowed three jokes and that's it, otherwise it goes on and on. \"I mean, in the end, I did it, and it is funny. Sex is funny. Most people's sex lives, if you had the whole detail, would be quite funny. That's the point - why you don't have the detail - because it's not right to laugh at people in that way.</p> <p>\"It is an absurd thing to do, looked at in any rational way. But sex is absurd - it is a very strange, completely animal thing that's not fully understood. And people don't really know why they like what they like, but why worry, as long as you're not hurting anybody? And as long as everybody involved is genuinely consensual, properly consensual, not just doing it for money or whatever.\" That's his argument about the women involved? \"Yes. They do it anyway.\" </p> <p>Hovering over the Mosley expos\u00e9 were the ghosts of his parents. In 1936, Oswald Mosley, Britain's most notorious fascist, married Diana Mitford, one of the famous aristocratic sisters, of whose looks Evelyn Waugh wrote: \"Her beauty ran through a room like a peal of bells.\" The wedding ceremony took place at the Berlin house of the Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels, with Hitler as a guest. Shortly after Max was born, the couple were interned in a London prison as a threat to state security during the second world war, and hounded out of Britain afterwards. They later briefly sent their son to be educated in Germany. Lady Mosley thought Hitler was a good man who meant well. </p> <p>Are Mosley's S&amp;M practices a reaction to his parents? \"I've seen one or two well-meaning articles saying I was exorcising something to do with my parents. It's just complete nonsense. I think most of the people who are into that - and I think most, how should I say it, unusual sexual activity - would say they were hard-wired and it was like that from very early childhood. Certainly, the women all say that. I can't say I've really discussed it much with men. </p> <p>\"I was conscious of that before I had the slightest idea what my parents did or didn't do. The idea that it's because of things that happened to you in your childhood, in my experience at least, is nonsense. I know at least one of the women has said to me the other day that she had an idyllic childhood, nobody ever did anything to her as a child, but she's just been hardwired like that since she was small. And I think this is true also probably of gay people, probably of transvestites, I don't know enough about it, but I suspect. Again, it doesn't matter as long as everybody wants to do it.\"</p> <p>Mosley remembers when he was three and a half being taken to see his parents, who were interned in a shared flat in Holloway prison before being released. \"I can remember the walls, the funny garden, the ash path. I can remember my father bringing a bucket of hot water for the bath.\"</p> <p>What did his parents really think of Hitler? \"My mother really liked Hitler. And my father didn't, for what reasons I don't really know. My father quite liked Mussolini but thought he was a bit over the top. Just as a person. For example, you'd go to his office apparently and it was a massive walk from the door to his desk. I think it's perfectly true to say my mother liked Hitler and would go on saying so until the end of her life. I never met him.\"</p> <p>And his parents view on the Holocaust? \"They were often asked about that and, of course, expressed complete horror. They didn't know about that when they knew him, like nobody did.\" His own view is that \"it's awful beyond dispute\".</p> <p>After the war, his father launched the Union Movement in Britain, campaigning against immigration after the London race riots. Max acted as an election agent for him in Manchester and was once arrested for getting into a fight with an anti-fascist who attacked his father at a London protest. \"I supported my father politically in my late teens and very early 20s and then lost interest. They were my parents so I was fond of them, but that's it.\"</p> <p>Mosley studied physics, became a lawyer and toyed with the idea of running as a Tory, but with his father's name hanging over him in England, he went into international motor sport. \"England is pretty unique in having this idea that it's completely your fault if your father had politics they don't like.\"</p> <p>He has headed formula one's governing body, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), for 15 years. He counts his championing of road safety as one of his biggest achievements. After the News of the World article he called a vote of confidence, despite advice not to, and won. His close friend, Bernie Ecclestone, the formula one commercial-rights holder, first suggested he should go, then accepted that he stay. His latest move is to clamp down on the massive \"unsustainable\" spending on motor sport. He says he will stand down when his term ends in 2009. \"They've all said keep on. I'm not sure yet how much of that is just being kind,\" he says. </p> <p>He was a small donor to New Labour but stopped at the time of the Iraq war, which he thought was illegal and a mistake. Does he see himself as part of the establishment, an English gentleman? \"I never see myself as a gentleman,\" he smiles. </p> <p>Mosley thinks the S&amp;M story was a conspiracy and someone in motor racing stitched him up. He has enlisted the former Met chief John Stevens' investigation company to look into it. \"I think it's undoubtedly related to motor racing, it's just a question of who. I've got some shrewd ideas. I've got my eye on them, let's put it like that.\"</p> <p>But his greatest sense of injustice is against the tabloid culture, for the invasion of privacy that he says devastated his family. \"To live in a society where the rules are made by the [tabloid] editors, I think, would horrify most people. Particularly as it's very one-sided. They never hesitate, for example, to use completely illegal means to get information, such as bribing people with access to the police computer. So they can't talk about morality, they are immoral themselves.\"</p> <p>Mosley has defamation and privacy cases in Germany, Italy and France, some of which are criminal proceedings. At the human rights court in Strasbourg, he is targeting the British government. His proposed law, to force editors to contact a subject before printing, would give them a chance to seek a court injunction to stop publication. \"People say, 'But this will cast a chill on investigative journalism.' Well no, because ... the judge isn't going to suppress that which should not be suppressed. But he will probably suppress the revelation of people's most private lives for no better purpose than to sell newspapers.\" He has set up a fund for less well-off victims of intrusion of privacy to help them bring cases against newspapers.</p> <p>Has he had lots of support and messages from what he calls the S&amp;M \"community\"? \"I've had no interesting offers,\" he smiles. But there has been support from politicians and showbusiness figures. </p> <p>Mosley knows he is an utterly charming old man and I don't find myself judging him at all. The only time he grimaces with embarrassment is when asked about his family, which he says was devastated but is staying together. How? \"I mean, it's just very difficult for my wife, it's very difficult for my sons. But we're all each other have got.\"</p> <p>I wonder if this incident will make him say never again to S&amp;M. He laughs, then looks very serious: \"You can't change how you are,\" he says. \"And I mean, I'd thought it all through donkey's years ago and seen the absurdity and all the rest of it. And I think most people who have that sort of side to their life do. But you will never completely lose interest in that sort of thing. You just don't, to be very honest\".</p> <p>\u2022 Listen to Max Mosley talking to Angelique Chrisa\ufb01s <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/audio\">theguardian.com/audio</a></p>",
  "<p>Voters in key swing states from Colorado to Ohio have been targeted with automated phone calls seeking to portray Barack Obama as an extremist who has befriended terrorists and Hollywood celebrities.</p> <p>Opening with the words, \"Hello. I'm calling for John McCain and the RNC [Republican national committee],\" the \"robocalls\" have kicked off a political storm, with Democrats and some Republicans denouncing the McCain campaign for resorting to a tactic the candidate himself has consistently repudiated.</p> <p>Several versions of the calls, addressing topics from abortion to terrorism, were reported by voters in Ohio, Colorado, New Mexico, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Missouri, North Carolina, Florida, Texas, West Virginia, Maine and Georgia.</p> <p>The call focusing on Republican claims that Obama is close to the 1960s radical William Ayers, states: \"You need to know that Barack Obama has worked closely with terrorist Bill Ayers, whose organisation bombed the US Capitol, the Pentagon, a judge's home, and killed Americans. Democrats will enact an extreme leftist agenda if they take control of Washington.\"</p> <p>Another call states: \"Barack Obama and his fellow Democrats got caught putting Hollywood above America. On the very day our elected leaders gathered in Washington to deal with the financial crisis, Barack Obama spent just 20 minutes with economic advisers, but hours at a celebrity Hollywood fundraiser. Where are the Democrats' priorities?\"</p> <p>A third call reprised an attack used in the final presidential debate: \"You need to know that Barack Obama ... opposed a bill requiring doctors to care for babies born alive after surviving attempted abortions ... Barack Obama and his liberal Democrats are too extreme for America ...\"</p> <p>The Senate Democratic majority leader, Harry Reid, expressed surprise at the \"scummy\" tactics. \"[I] can't believe John McCain knows what's going on.\"</p> <p>\"These kind of tactics have no place in Maine politics,\" a spokesman for the Maine Republican senator, Susan Collins, said. Collins is engaged in a tough re-election battle.</p> <p>Critics of the campaign's use of robocalls noted that McCain's professed opposition to the tactic was underpinned by the belief that his downfall in the 2000 Republican presidential primary campaign was due in part to the use of such tactics by his rival, George Bush. With that race tightening, voters in South Carolina received calls asking: \"Would you be more or less likely to vote for John McCain ... if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate black child?\"</p> <p>Bush won South Carolina after the allegation, a distortion of the McCains' adoption of a daughter from Bangladesh. That campaign was orchestrated in part by a former South Carolina attorney general, Charlie Condon. Earlier this year, Condon was appointed chairman of the McCain campaign in South Carolina.</p> <p>This week's calls were reportedly the work of a company owned by a Republican consultant named Jeff Larson, as were those made against McCain in 2000. At the time, McCain denounced the practice, saying: \"I promise you I have never, and will never, have anything to do with that kind of political tactic.\"</p> <p>Asked on Sunday if he would stop the calls, McCain said that this time was different. \"These are legitimate and truthful and they are far different than the phone calls that were made about my family ... this is dramatically different and either you ... didn't see those things in 2000 ... or you don't know the difference between that and what is a legitimate issue, and that is Senator Obama being truthful with the American people.\"</p> <p>An Obama campaign spokesman told the New York Times that the use of robocalls reminiscent of the 2000 campaign showed \"just how much McCain has changed since then - adopting not only President Bush's policies but his tactics\".</p> <p>A spokesman for the McCain campaign defended the latest calls, telling the New York Times, \"I would argue that much of these calls are based on hardened facts that American voters should consider.\"</p> <p>During this year's Republican primaries, McCain campaign manager Steve Schmidt decried robocalls, saying, \"[It's] a conveyance to introduce new information - and a lot of that information on the phone is slanderous and smearing.\"</p> <p>The robocalls are reported to be part of a $70m get-out-the-vote campaign being waged by the Republican party and the McCain campaign in key battleground states.</p> <p>Although common in the closing stages of a campaign, the calls' effectiveness is open to question, according to Vanderbilt University's John Geer.</p> <p>Robocalls, he told the Washington Post, \"may stimulate turnout, but they would have to be targeted to the right people. It could backfire, and if the attacks get in the mainstream media, the push back, too, could be substantial.\"</p> <p>The Guardian's coast-to-coast team attend a get-out-the-vote rally in Sante Fe and talk to some of the hundreds of Obama supporters lining up to cast their vote ahead of polling day on November 4.

  "<p>On the day Alistair Darling launched his rescue package for the banks, using \u00a3500bn of taxpayers' money, what did the Sun choose for its front-page splash? A picture of some luxury mansion owned by Sir Fred Goodwin, the arrogant chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland? Or one owned by the HBOS chairman and New Labour crony Lord Stevenson?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338791549\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2008/10/20/sun220b.jpg\" alt=\"Sun 'Mother of all council houses' front\" width=\"220\" height=\"288\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sun 'Mother of all council houses' front</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The picture was of a big house all right, apparently valued at \u00a31.2m, though hardly a mansion. The occupant? Why, Toorpaki Saiedi, a woman who presses every newspaper button: Afghan migrant, seven children, no job, no resident male partner and a big house paid for by the local council. OK, the story was a legitimate one, because it exposed an arcane absurdity in the housing allowance system, which led Ealing council in west London to pay a private landlord more than \u00a312,000 a month in rent when it couldn't provide the homeless family with a home of sufficient size. But the cost to the public purse - which the Sun calculated as \u00a3170,000 a year in rent plus benefits - is 0.0000003% of that incurred by the bank rescue. Put another way, you'd need something like 3 million Afghan families living in similar circumstances to match the cost of Darling's bail-out.</p> <p>Within a day of the Sun's report, three council officials had lost their jobs, more rapidly than any top bank executives lost theirs. Problem sorted? Not as far as the press was concerned. The News of the World gave it another splash, plus a spread on pages 4 and 5, having got \"inside \u00a31.2m Scrounger Palace\" to identify a 50in plasma TV, a leather six-piece suite, an iPhone, and \"silk furnishings\". You might think \"Scrounging the jackpot\" (Sunday Times) and \"A story that sums up the howling insanity of modern Britain\" (Daily Mail) would be headlines about bankers and hedge fund traders - until you saw that the bylines below were, respectively, Rod Liddle and Richard Littlejohn.</p> <p>Liddle put the boot into Saiedi's 20-year-old son, Jawad, because he was pictured pointing at the house and grinning. The family came to Britain in 2001 when their homeland was ruled by the Taliban, a regime so odious that the British and Americans insisted they were doing the Afghans a favour by invading them. This elicited scant sympathy from Liddle, who suggested \"the Taliban may have had a point, all things considered\" (such wit!). Littlejohn didn't quite say the Saiedi family was responsible for the financial crisis, but portrayed them as \"luxuriating\" while \"millions worry about the prospect of losing their jobs, their homes, their savings and their pensions\". In the Mirror, Tony Parsons yoked \"City spivs\" and \"that Afghan woman\" together: Saiedi \"looks exactly like the scalded fat cats who are being bailed out from Canary Wharf to Wall Street\".</p> <p>And that takes us to the heart of this matter. Why do papers that have millions of readers on modest incomes get more enraged about poor people receiving state help than about bankers pulling in annual bonuses that exceed, many times over, what their readers earn in a lifetime? The proper Marxist answer is that the corporate-owned press and its lickspittle journalists are trying to direct the workers' anger away from the bourgeoisie towards members of their own class. The depressing truth, however, is that newspapers are giving readers what they want. Sociologists have long debated why wide inequalities do not cause more public anger. The main reason, they believe, is that the super-rich are too remote from the mass of the population to provoke envy. Their children don't attend the same schools, they don't work, shop or play in the same places. Unlike politicians, they don't even appear on TV.</p> <p>As WG Runciman put it more than 40 years ago in Relative Deprivation and Social Justice, \"envy is a difficult emotion to sustain across a broad social distance\". Indeed, concern about inequality is now, if anything, more evident among the upper-middle classes who went to the same schools and universities as the super-rich and aspire to a similar lifestyle. Ordinary folk envy people like themselves, living in the next street and doing a bit better than they are, probably undeservedly. If those people are from an alien culture, so much the worse.</p> <p>If papers needed human interest, they might have tried, as the financial crisis grew, to find detailed examples of lost jobs and lost homes, relating them to the greed and incompetence of the \"fat cats\" in financial services. True, the worst, by general consent, is still ahead. But more than 150,000 jobs went between June and August alone and 18,900 homes were repossessed in the first half of the year. Alas, Paul Lewis's beautifully crafted report on the front page of last Wednesday's Guardian - about a Stoke-on-Trent laboratory manager who had just lost his job - is all too rare. The infrastructure that delivered such stories - the local stringers, the newsrooms of generalists who could spend days outside London - has virtually collapsed since the last recession.</p> <p>I fear, as this recession deepens, the Saiedis will be the first of many scapegoats. Newspapers will be careful not to incite violence explicitly or back extreme rightwing groups. But public anger is all too likely and the mass market papers, more desperate for readers than ever, are helping to create an atmosphere where it will be directed against the wrong targets, with possibly grim consequences.</p> <p><strong>Ritchie picking</strong></p> <p>The redtops are in a frenzy over the divorce of Madonna and Guy Ritchie. Never mind that there doesn't seem to be much dispute over either money or children; according to the Sun, \"this one is shaping up to get dirty\". </p> <p>The paper quoted both sides on its front page. \"She says: 'He's a lazy tightwad' ... He says: 'She's just a domineering control freak ...'\" Neither had said a word; the quotes, as always, came from unnamed \"sources\". As for the Mirror, it is in high dudgeon because when it reported in June that the marriage was ending, the couple denied it. \"We'd ... done the hard work for them by informing the world ... They could've gracefully confirmed it.\" Instead, they \"put on a show of togetherness\". </p> <p>How dare they! I hope the couple have learnt their lesson and will, as their divorce proceeds, ensure their dirty linen is properly displayed in Her Majesty's Redtop Press.</p>",
  "<p>Alex Salmond yesterday blamed Gordon Brown for the economic \"calamity\" that has forced the government to find \u00a3200bn to bail out the UK's banking sector.</p> <p>The Scottish National party leader accused Brown of \"presiding over the biggest economic reverse for a generation\", deriding him as the \"sub-prime minister\". </p> <p>Speaking as he closed the SNP's annual conference in Perth, Salmond also tried to quash doubts - fuelled by Brown last week - over Scottish independence. He rejected repeated claims by the Labour leader and the new Scottish secretary, Jim Murphy, that the banking crises in Iceland, Ireland and Norway were powerful evidence against a separate Scotland. </p> <p>Salmond said that with the exception of Iceland many of northern Europe's smaller nations were expected, according to the International Monetary Fund, to escape recession. But the UK was expected \"to tumble into the economic mire\".</p> <p>Brown had \"almost broken the banking system\" by failing to control hedge funds, by allowing assets to be massively overvalued, and by removing legal controls on the financial sector during his 11 years in Downing Street, Salmond added. The UK government should now press for deeper cuts in interest rates, cut taxes on domestic energy bills, and increase spending on public capital projects to reflate the economy, he said. </p> <p>He accused Brown of overseeing a boom and bust made in London. The Royal Bank of Scotland had had to give the government preference shares of 12%, and HBOS was to be sold to Lloyds TSB. </p> <p>\"The prime minister thinks this is an advert for the union? I would have thought that the condition of the economy, the fears of our people, the state of the financial sector, are a staggering condemnation of the state of the United Kingdom,\" he said. He called on the chancellor, Alistair Darling, to block the sale of HBOS until the government could show why it could not survive on its own with the available emergency funds. </p> <p>\"It does not deserve to be cast aside as a consequence of the age of irresponsibility,\" he said. </p> <p>But Iain Gray, the Scottish Labour party leader, said Salmond had clung to \"the politics of grievance and indulged in a blame game\". He said the SNP leader had \"called for a new age of responsibility, yet he dodged his today\". </p> <p>Yesterday Scotland's first minister appeared to admit his government could not intervene meaningfully and would rely on the government in London to regenerate the economy.</p>",
  "<p>A machine gun invented before the second world war may have brought down a British Hercules plane that crashed in Iraq with the loss of 10 lives, it has emerged.</p> <p>It has been accepted that small arms fire hit the Hercules C130 as it flew at low level near Baghdad in January 2005, causing a deadly explosion in a wing fuel tank. </p> <p>But the inquest of the 10 men, which is due to conclude this week, heard claims of a second possibility, that it may have been hit by a much bigger weapon that has been in use for more than 60 years. </p> <p>The name of the weapon has not been given in open session because of concerns that the information may be useful to Britain's enemies in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. The Guardian knows the identity of the gun as well but it is not naming the weapon for the same reason. </p> <p>However, in open session at the end of last week Bernard Collaery, who is representing Kelly Merrith, widow of navigator Paul Pardoel, gave details of the machine gun he believed had brought down the plane. </p> <p>He said it fired a projectile up to 10cm \"full of phosphorus that burns like a grenade\". Collaery added that it had been used against British troops as long ago as the second world war. </p> <p>The claims are significant because changes to the way the Hercules is defended and how it operates have been made partly on the basis that it was brought down by small arms. Since the tragedy, Hercules only fly low over enemy territory when absolutely necessary.</p> <p>The Wiltshire coroner, David Masters, is due to sum up and give his verdict later this week. He has expressed concern during the hearing that warnings about the fuel tanks' vulnerability were not heeded and is likely to be critical of how safety recommendations were dealt with.</p>",
  "<p>Eddie Thompson, who has died of cancer aged 68, belonged to an increasingly rare species of football club chairmen who are adored by the fellow supporters whom they seek to serve.</p> <p>Though born in Glasgow, he had been a supporter of Dundee United for almost 40 years when he won control of the club in 2002, after a long and bitter battle. By the time of his death, its financial position had been secured; today, United are again a force to be reckoned with in Scottish football, and the supporters' trust that Thompson encouraged is the club's second biggest shareholder, behind his family.</p> <p>At the Scottish league cup final earlier this year, thousands of Dundee United fans - aware that his days were numbered - donned \"One Eddie Thompson\" T-shirts. A stand at Tannadice Park was named in his honour and since news of his death was announced, vast numbers of floral tributes have been deposited at the ground. It is all a far cry from football clubs owned by sheikhs and oligarchs.</p> <p>Thompson made his fortune in the grocery business. Educated at Hyndland secondary school, Glasgow, and trained as an accountant, he moved to Dundee in 1964 with a wholesaleing company, Watson &amp; Philip. He became managing director in 1989, though by this time he had ambitions to develop a chain of convenience stores, often in areas where other retailers would not go.</p> <p>The company he developed, called Morning, Noon and Night, transformed the image of the corner shop in Scotland and created a model that was widely emulated. By the time he sold it to one of the Scottish Co-operative societies in 2004 for \u00a330m, it had more than 50 branches and employed 800 people. He was made an OBE in 2005 in recognition of his skill as a retailer.</p> <p>From the 1980s Thompson was involved with Dundee United as a shirt sponsor. Those were glory days for the Tannadice club and a remarkable era in Scottish football, with the \"new firm\" of Aberdeen under Alex Ferguson and United under Jim McLean vying for supremacy over Celtic and Rangers. Dundee United achieved the astonishing feat in 1984 of reaching the European Cup semi-final, only to be beaten by Roma in a game where the referee was later shown to have been bribed.</p> <p>As the club descended into mediocrity and financial difficulty during the 1990s, the clamour for ownership to be opened to a wider range of shareholders grew. Thompson made repeated efforts to invest and finally, after a four-year battle, bought McLean's shareholding in 2002 for \u00a31m and put in another \u00a34m.</p> <p>For most of his remaining years, Thompson was fighting cancer. Yet he remained an enthusiastic and committed figure in Scottish football. His amiable manner did not stop him being ruthless, particularly in the removal of managers, four of whom came and went during his tenure. The fifth to cross the Tannadice threshold, the former Hearts player Craig Levein, developed a deeply felt personal, as well as professional, relationship with Thompson.

  "<p><strong>Abu Dhabi</strong><br><strong>Media on the map </strong><br>The BBC, Thomson Reuters, CNN International, along with a host of other international media companies, last week committed themselves as partners to the new Abu Dhabi media zone. The scheme - called twofour54, the coordinates of the capital city of United Arab Emirates - is a state-funded attempt to diversify the economy away from its reliance on oil and gas. So how much is it all costing? A \"significant sum\", is the well-worn line from twofour54 - no one is saying how much of Sheikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Al Nahyan's money is in the pot. If the lavish launch, including Duran Duran playing live at a cost of hundreds of thousands, is anything to go by, an astronomical sum. And isn't there a similar project 90 minutes away - Dubai Media City? And other projects in Egypt and Jordan? Well, yes.</p> <p>The Abu Dhabi Media Authority, however, is at pains to highlight the unique selling points and ambition of the zone; to build a media content economy that is both in and for the region. That means film production, television, video game development and news programming that is rich with Arab-created content, and media zones across the region able to work together.</p> <p>The project is part of the UAE's erosion of censorship and move toward a freer media - there is even a proposed law that could end jail terms for press violations. But a quick flick through the local papers or five minutes watching a news broadcast makes it obvious that punches continue to be pulled when it comes to the ruling elites, and there is still strong regulatory control.</p> <p>And as with other bits of Abu Dhabi's economic diversification process, the plans are grand but the buildings are not yet up. Formula one is coming to the city, but the track isn't fully built yet; a spectacular cultural zone is nothing more than a sandy building site, as are a host of other citywide developments which exist only on paper. </p> <p>However, progress can be swift in the region. Former Telegraph editor Martin Newland moved to Abu Dhabi to set up the state-funded newspaper the National last year. At last week's launch, he told MediaGuardian that from the first moves to the presses rolling in April took just eight months, and next month the National will launch a weekend edition. When the Sheikh's involved, it seems, things get moving.<br><strong>Oliver Luft</strong></p> <p><strong>Pakistan</strong><br><strong>Nation's conscience</strong><br>Last year an anchor on the popular Pakistan news channel Geo TV broke down live on air during an army siege of a mosque where religious militants had been holed up. For some it was an embarrassing example of how far television still had to go on impartiality. Pakistan's burgeoning TV industry is increasingly being described as the \"wild west\", with the number of channels beamed out on cable exploding to more than a hundred over the last five years, around a quarter of which are 24-hour news broadcasters - news programmes consistently get more viewers than entertainment across the country. </p> <p>The dilemma for broadcasters is whether television news can avoid turning news into entertainment in an age of terrorism. \"In an effort to win viewers in an increasing competitive market, news channels are turning terrorism into a trivial issue almost like a soap opera,\" says Waseem Mehmood, a British journalist who has been running a large grass-roots anti-terrorism campaign in Pakistan. \"The flames are being fanned by sensationalistic reporting which fails to be either balanced or to address the real issues.\" Open criticism is hard to find, but many Pakistanis privately criticise channels for giving a platform to extremist preachers who call for violence. News presenters and journalists regularly use language that sympathises with hardliners. Amir Zia, director of news and current affairs at Samaa News, says broadcasters are waking up to the huge impact they have across the country. \"News channels have a lot of responsibility in Pakistan.\"</p> <p>One conglomerate, the Jang Group, which has print and television interests, has launched its own anti-terrorism campaign across its outlets. But as one editor noted at Dawn News, the country's only English news channel, all this has little impact if more moderate voices are not given the space to challenge extremist religious groups and even the government. </p> <p>At a time when many Pakistanis fear their country is on the verge of falling apart, its lively news media have been thrust into the unlikely position of acting as the nation's conscience. As one news editor puts it: \"The politicians have never had much credibility. And in the past few years the army, Pakistan's only well organised and stable institution, too has lost a lot of respect. It is left to us in the media to voice people's troubles.\"<br><strong>Sunny Hundal</strong></p> <p><strong>Magazines</strong><br><strong>Seven year itch</strong><br>When Marie O'Riordan announced last week that she would stand down after more than seven years as Marie Claire editor, the official word was that she would be leaving at Christmas to \"explore new opportunities\". After a good innings O'Riordan just wanted a change of scenery (which might explain her quote about \"fresh woods\" - one presumes she's not considering a new career as a tree surgeon).</p> <p>It's a luxurious choice that very few can afford to take. So has O'Riordan, who joined the title in 2001, fallen foul of the mag editor's seven (ish) year itch? She'd be in good company. Mark Frith had a healthy eight-year innings in the chair at Heat magazine before getting itchy feet, leaving and brokering a deal to publish The Celeb Diaries. But compared to a number of her contemporaries on the big titles, O'Riordan's stint makes her a relative spring chicken. </p> <p>At the glossiest of Cond\u00e9 Nast's glossies it seems impossible to get rid of them. Tatler editor Geordie Greig has been in the chair since 1999; and Sarah Miller, launch editor of Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller in 1997, is still in control. Of the chaps, Dylan Jones, editor of British GQ, is coming up for 10 years at the helm with no sign of any imminent departure - although he does have side projects and his pal Dave Cameron to keep him refreshed.</p> <p>But they are mere beginners compared to UK Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman who has been dictating who the fashionistas wear, what colour their drinks are and how 'fierce' their conversation should be, since 1992 - although even that isn't as long as Shulman's counterpart at US Vogue, Anna Wintour, who has been editing the title for two decades now. \"I suppose in the end, in my case, it's more of a question of why would you leave? Editing Vogue is a great job,\" Shulman says. \"It surprises me that the time has gone really quickly and it surprises me that it is so long, but I never feel that I'm doing the same thing ever.\"</p> <p>In any case, it's not unheard of for editors to return to the industry. Chris Hemblade, the former executive editor of Elle, left after three years for a full-time gig at Macmillan Cancer Support as \"VIP +\" celebrity executive. It took three months for him to return to mag-land as a senior contributing editor of Harper's Bazaar.<br><strong>Oliver Luft</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Friday October 24 2008.

  "<p>At the cocktail parties and bistros of Cannes last week, all anyone at the annual Mipcom programme market wanted to talk about was the economy. But the difference between the TV executives on the C\u00f4te d'Azur and the bankers and lawyers having the same conversation elsewhere was the glint of optimism. Sipping champagne, more than one TV executive said that when the economy goes down the pan, people turn to home entertainment to cheer themselves up. </p> <p>\"Depression time is a good time for entertainment programming,\" says Rob Clark, vice-president of worldwide entertainment and production for FremantleMedia, home of The X Factor and Britain's Got Talent. \"People don't want to go home and be clobbered with dreary stuff.\"</p> <p>There is no denying that parts of the TV industry have already found themselves in the mire because of the downturn. A slump in ad revenues has prompted Channel 4 to axe up to 150 jobs and slash its \u00a3600m programme budget by \u00a325m, while ITV is cutting 1,000 posts. </p> <p>But Paul Richards, a media analyst at Numis Securities, says he expects Sky to post a jump of 74,000 subscribers when it reports figures for the latest quarter at the end of the month. \"BSkyB is one of the areas that holds up well in a downturn,\" he says. \"If you are going out less, you are watching TV more.\" The Sex and the City movie DVD shifted nearly 1m copies in its first week of release last month, and rental firm Lovefilm has reported a 40% jump in business since the credit crunch began.</p> <p>There was no apparent slackening in the number of deals being done in Cannes. Indeed, with many broadcasters cutting their budgets for original programming, acquired shows and repeats have suddenly become more important in filling the schedules.</p> <p>Even though there is less money to go round, production companies are still making money on repeats, says Don Taffner Jr, president of My Family producer DLT Entertainment. \"Producers are often losing money on productions because they are producing less shows or budgets are tighter, but we make up for it through broadcasters repeating shows,\" he says.</p> <p>\"That helps mitigate things ... Broadcasters still have to put shows on the air. And there will be more people watching because it is 'free' to do so.\" BBC Worldwide is one of Mipcom's biggest sellers and the division's managing director of sales and distribution, Steve Macallister, says that business has been as good as ever, adding that when broadcasters cut shows, they want to replace them with those of a similar quality. </p> <p>\"We find that even in so-called quiet times like this, we have got an absolutely packed stand,\" he says.\"Broadcasters are being a little bit more cautious, but based on our experience from previous cycles like this, people who cut production budgets are still acquiring programming. People want to buy content which is reliable and is a known and trusted brand.\"</p> <p>While the economic downturn is good news for programme sellers, it seems also to be positive for those making comedy and entertainment shows. British-based firm FremantleMedia, also behind American Idol, has presented a range of entertainment programmes to buyers, including the dating format Take Me Out, picked up as a pilot by C4. A new generation of Japanese gameshows are also high on the agenda following the success of BBC1's Hole in the Wall. All Star Athletics has two teams go head to head in a series of competitive events, while To the Limit features everyday tasks taken to the extreme. British broadcasters are said to have shown interest in both.</p> <p>FremantleMedia's chief executive, Tony Cohen, warned that his firm - responsible for three of the top 10 global TV formats - would \"not be immune\" from a recession but said it had experience of weathering economic downturns, such as the one that followed 9/11 in 2001.</p> <p>During the 2001 downturn, advertising revenues fell steeply until 2003 with programme budgets coming under pressure. However, following that period the industry saw the rise of the \"super-indies\" - firms which grew quickly by snapping up their rivals. Today, it is much more consolidated, but despite the tightening of the credit markets, the big firms haven't yet sated their appetite for expansion. Cohen said the company intended to spend \"a lot more\" money on development as well as investing further in talent.</p> <p>Creating new ideas is the lifeblood of the TV industry. TwoFour Broadcast, which made Noel's HQ for Sky1, has had a pilot commissioned by an unnamed broadcaster based around the downturn. </p> <p>The \"location-based entertainment show\" looks at excess spending in a \"non-preaching kind of way\", says managing director Melanie Leach. \"It is about the fact we have all spent too much money. It just felt like the right idea at the right time. It is our response to the credit crunch.\" Leach adds that the firm pitched the idea when the economy first started to turn and it was enthusiastically greeted by broadcasters. A new genre of programming has emerged - thrift shows, such as Twiggy's Frock Exchange on BBC2, Channel Five's money-saving series It Pays to Watch and C4's Gok Wan's Fashion Fix, which aims to prove \"you don't need a fortune to look fabulous\".</p> <p>But as well as stimulating new ideas, the downturn is making others seem outdated. With house prices collapsing, property shows, such as Channel 4's Property Ladder, increasingly look like a remnant from a distant past. \"I don't think property will ever be off air, but it needs a different approach,\" says Leach. \"Property investment shows are over.\"</p> <p>Maverick TV, the maker of C4's How to Look Good Naked, has just been commissioned by BBC2 to make Brand New Home, about redesigning homes. Other new BBC property shows include Axe the Agent, on the merits of selling property without an estate agent, and Buy It, Sell It, Bank It, which will look at auctions. </p> <p>The producers of Location, Location, Location have had a reality check too - they will air a feature-length special looking at the credit crunch and what homeowners can do about it next month. But the downturn has put paid to a Location, Location, Location property website.</p> <p>The funding of shows is also set to change with the days of plentiful cash now over. \"Broadcasters are looking for more low-cost formats,\" Leach says. \"Two years ago, you couldn't make shows expensive enough - now, everyone wants to know how cheap you can make them. </p> <p>Lee Bartlett, the new managing director of ITV Global Content, the broadcaster's production arm, says he wants to see longer runs of dramas in order to create better efficiences of scale. Bartlett, who is American, previously worked at the US networks ABC and Fox, where 22-episode dramas are the norm. In the UK, making six episodes is more usual. </p> <p>\"UK broadcasters currently commission six episodes and if the show is successful, they commission a second series,\" he says. \"By the time they do that, they've shut down production and have to relaunch production, rehire crews and on-camera talent which costs a lot more than producing 13 episodes continuously. There is also additional market spend so that the audience knows the show is back.\"</p> <p>He says he aims to film drama series much closer to their transmission dates, so that if a show debuts successfully, it can be extended more cheaply. The new model would need star writers to work in teams rather than by themselves as usually happens, but the idea is already understood to have the support of ITV director of television Peter Fincham. \"It's about maintaining quality while making production smarter,\" Bartlett says. \"And if I do that, then to a certain extent I am doing it cheaper at the same time as adding value.\"</p> <p>Long-running BBC1 comedy My Family is one of the few UK shows that uses team writing, but Taffner Jr says he expects the downturn to encourage more production companies to use the model.</p> <p>With less money in the system, new business models for production must be found. One scheme used by the BBC is set to be extended to C4, according to insiders. The initiative sees banks, such as Barclays and the Bank of Ireland, loan the production costs of some shows to producers so they don't appear on the BBC's balance sheet in a particular year. The BBC then pays the loan back in a different financial year, helping to spread its costs.</p> <p>Despite credit drying up for many industries, the fact that TV is seen as a relatively safe bet - particularly the BBC - was reflected in the number of bankers in Cannes wooing producers at champagne parties. Yet the nature of the deals has changed. Programme distributor DCD Rights, part of DCD Media which owns UK companies such as youth producer Done and Dusted, came to Mipcom with a new funding model - a \u00a310m private equity pot to invest in programming. \"The people who used to come to Cannes to invest highly leveraged sums like $200m in big deals are now looking to do smaller deals, because the credit is no longer there,\" says DCD Media chief executive Chris Hunt. \"People...are getting more inventive about how to make their money work.\"</p> <p><strong><br>Re-programming for the credit crunch</strong><br><strong>11am BBC1.

  "<p>Byron wrote that \"I think it great affectation not to quote oneself.\" On that basis, I'd like to quote what I wrote in a piece about the City of London, in the aftermath of the Northern Rock fiasco: \"If our laws are not extended to control the new kinds of super-powerful, super-complex and potentially super-risky investment vehicles, they will one day cause a financial disaster of global-systemic proportions.\"</p> <p>The prediction was right, but the tense was wrong. The disaster had already happened, it just hadn't yet played itself out. It is doing so now, though. The recipe is starting to become well known, but perhaps it's worth spelling it out one more time. Financial institutions in the US lent money to people with poor credit histories. This wasn't a bad thing in itself - indeed it could be seen as an example of capitalism at its most beneficently creative. The invention that made it possible for the lending to become reckless was securitisation: the process by which loans were added together and sold on to other institutions as packages of debt. This had the effect of making the initial lender indifferent to whether or not the loan could be repaid. These packages of debt were then resold in the form of horrendously complex financial instruments, and it is these that are the basis of the global jamming-up of capital markets. The overlapping loans are so complicated that no one knows who owns what underlying debt, and, furthermore, no one knows what these assets are worth. (If you own someone else's debt, it counts as an asset.) The mechanism for assessing the value of these assets is the market: they are worth what someone is prepared to pay. At the moment, because no one is buying, no one has a clue what they're worth, if anything. Because of an accountancy practice called \"mark to market\", requiring that assets be listed at their current values, this fact had to be reflected in the companies' balance sheets - so these balance sheets suddenly looked disastrous. As a result, banks are reluctant to lend to each other, and the entire financial system has ground to a halt: such capital as is moving in the markets is supplied by the central banks, which have to date pumped in hundreds of billions of dollars to generate some liquidity.</p> <p>The scorecard began with Northern Rock, done in by Britain's first bank run in 150 years. The bank was a demutualised former mutual society. It had adopted a groovy, go-go financial strategy: only 27% of its funds came from money deposited by savers; the rest came from short-term borrowing from the international money markets. When they choked up, the Rock sought emergency funding from the Bank of England, which acted too slowly and triggered the run, which led to its nationalisation on February 17.</p> <p>Note that the Rock wasn't destroyed by risky lending. Some of its loans were risky: a banker told me that there was trouble with a \"book\" of mortgage loans for 120% of the value of homes. But what ruined the bank was its exposure to the now malfunctioning money markets.</p> <p>Next to go was the US investment bank Bear Stearns. This bank had too great an exposure to sub-prime debt; investors fled, the share price collapsed, and on 16 March the bank was bought by its competitor JP Morgan, its market value having declined from $20bn to $236m. The US government underwrote the purchase by providing a guarantee of $29bn against the bank's mortgage liabilities, in order to make the rest of the bank viable for purchase. It did so because it was worried about the risk to the the banking system if Bear Stearns collapsed.</p> <p>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were more directly done in by bad loans. These odd institutions are/were a hybrid, with capital drawn from shareholders but underwriting from the US government: their function was to underwrite the mortgages given by other institutions, and to provide liquidity to the mortgage markets. They are \"government sponsored enterprises\" whose deposits are not guaranteed by the government, a fact nobody believed, since it was generally felt certain that if Fannie and Freddie ever got into trouble, the government would have to bail them out. That assumption turned out to be correct. After the collapse in US house prices and the soaring default rate of mortgages, Freddie and Fannie, with mortgage-backed securities worth $5 trillion and debt of $1.6 trillion, were on the verge of going under, and they were taken into \"conservatorship\" by the US government on September 7.</p> <p>The term \"conservatorship\" fails to mask the fact that this was, by cash value, the biggest nationalisation in history. It was followed eight days later by the largest bankruptcy in history, when the investment bank Lehman Brothers went into Chapter 11, the American form of receivership. Lehman had an impressive $613bn of debt, but some parts of its various businesses were viable: it was the holding company that went broke, leaving the subsidiary businesses free to be sold off. The main one, the US investment banking arm, was bought by Barclays for $250m, with another $1.5bn for buildings and data centres. Oh, and $2.5bn in bonuses that would be paid for the bank's New York staff. The previous year, Lehman's bonuses were $5.7bn.</p> <p>If you are wondering how a total of $8,200,000,000 could be paid in bonuses over two years to the great minds whose company went bankrupt, what can I tell you? The bonus question is often seen as a tragicomic footnote to the business of banking, but it may be close to the heart of the problem. Through history, great fortunes have been made by people directly taking risks on their own account. Today, great fortunes are made by employees, doing nothing other than their jobs: jobs which, in the case of bankers, involve taking on risks, usually with other people's borrowed money. To make more money, and earn more bonuses (which are usually 60% of an investment banker's pay), it's simple: you just take on more risk. The upside is the upside, and the downside - well, it increasingly seems that for the bankers themselves, certainly in the case of Lehman New York, there isn't one. This undermines the whole principle of \"moral hazard\", which was the idea behind letting Lehman go under in the first place - the need for companies to face the consequences of their decisions. This principle obviously collapses if the individuals involved don't face any consequences.</p> <p>By allowing Lehman to go under, the US Treasury seemed to be making the point that, where possible, it would allow the market to take its course. The markets reacted with horror. It is now received wisdom that it was the US government's willingness to let Lehman Brothers fail that triggered the meltdown, by causing fear to become panic. The day after the biggest bankruptcy in history saw the biggest bail-out of a private company in history, with the US government taking a 79.9% share in the insurer AIG in return for a loan facility of $85bn. AIG was exposed to a lot of bad loans, and was valuing its mortgage securities at 1.7 to two times as much as Lehman had valued its. So if Lehman was broke, AIG was in an even worse position.</p> <p>The spectacular scale of these implosions masked what would otherwise have been a gigantic story: Merrill Lynch being taken over by the Bank of America on September 14, after a year of huge losses linked to sub-prime mortgages. On September 21, Goldman Sachs, the world's biggest investment bank, and Morgan Stanley converted their legal status from investment banks to holding banks, a change which allowed them access to help from the Federal Reserve in return for a greatly increased level of government supervision. Goldman had done all right in the initial phases of the credit crunch, but the general turn against banking stocks nonetheless did for its status as an investment bank. That means that in the past months the five biggest investment banks in New York - Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley - have ceased to exist as investment banks. On September 25 came the largest bank failure in American history, as Washington Mutual (WaMu) went into receivership following a bank run during which its customers withdrew $16.7bn in 10 days.</p> <p>Taking all these superlatives together, it is easy to see why the Federal Reserve and the US Treasury (run by Hank Paulson, former head of Goldman Sachs) decided to step in. The idea is to buy up the toxic assets which are poisoning the banking system, so that the banks can go back to lending money to each other. They must have known that the initial plan wouldn't pass unamended: it was only three pages long and the only power it didn't grant Paulson was the right to call himself God-King Hank the First. After being knocked back by the House of Representatives, it hit the floor of the Senate at 451 pages, passed, and then was passed in its amended form by the House. It is a strange document, crammed with tax cuts and pork and populist gestures but at its heart allowing Paulson to buy any \"troubled assets\" he likes, at any price he sees fit.</p> <p>It is going to be interesting to see if the bail-out works. The usual model for a crisis of this scale is for the state to take over the troubled institutions, then go through the books separating the good from the bad assets, and selling them off, part one and then part two. The bail-out is an attempt to do part two of that without doing part one, no doubt because the problem is so big that part one would involve the nationalisation of the entire US banking system. The socialisation of US banking would be a hell of a punchline to decades of unfettered liberal capitalism. As it stands, the plan is socialism for the rich.</p> <p>The British and European scorecard seemed, at the start, less spectacular. On 18 September, news of the biggest bank merger - carefully not denominated a takeover - in British history: Lloyds was to buy HBOS, the largest mortgage lender in the UK, with 20% of the market. HBOS had taken on a disproportionate share of the newer, riskier mortgages, and also was only 58% funded by depositors, the rest of its funds coming from the wholesale markets; a much safer ratio than the 27% of depositor funding held by Northern Rock, but still enough for the share price to collapse and induce a takeover. On September 28, the Luxembourg, Belgian and Dutch governments nationalised the bank Fortis, the biggest private employer in Belgium, at a cost of \u20ac11.2bn, after its share price collapsed. </p> <p>On September 29, Bradford &amp; Bingley (another demutualised former building society), which had the largest share of the buy-to-let market, was nationalised, at a cost of \u00a341.3bn, and its branch network sold off to the Spanish bank Santander - the classic part one, part two model. On September 30, the Icelandic government nationalised the country's third largest bank, Giltnir. Iceland's second biggest bank, Landsbanki, followed on October 7 and its biggest, Kaupthing, on October 9. The Icelandic government would not guarantee overseas depositors' money, including nearly \u00a31bn of UK local government cash. This caused the British to use anti-terrorism legislation to freeze Landsbanki's assets in the UK. The German commercial property loan giant Hypo Real Estate was bailed out on 5 October at a cost of \u20ac50bn. At the same time the German government blurted out that it was guaranteeing the deposits of all savers, a bizarre thing to do given that the previous day it had criticised the Irish government for doing the same thing. It became obvious that the absence of a European equivalent of the Fed - able to impose a consistent Eurozone policy - is a huge strategic problem for the EU.</p> <p>The markets went into freefall - especially banking shares. On October 7, HBOS and Lloyds both lost 40% of their value. A total collapse seemed possible. In the early hours of October 8, the British government announced that it was forcing the eight biggest banks to increase their levels of capitalisation, and offering to provide them the money to do that, in return for \"preference shares\". These are a last-in-first-out type of shareholding, without voting rights or a link to the share price. First, though, the object of the exercise is to prevent further systemic meltdown, and, to that end, the government offered another \u00a3200bn of short-term loans: the kind of loan whose absence is at the heart of the current freeze-up. The government is also offering \u00a3250bn of loan guarantees to back loans between the banks. It is a partial form of nationalisation, and constitutes the biggest move ever to shore up the UK banking system. At the same time, six central banks - in the US, UK, EU, Sweden, Switzerland and Canada - cut interest rates by 0.5%, and China cut rates by 0.27%.</p> <p>Will it work? Let's hope so. No other government has, at the time of writing, moved as boldly and systematically as the British, and the government clearly hopes that these huge new moves will bring the market to its senses, and allow us to have a good old-fashioned recession, rather than a full-scale depression. One of the problems is that our big banks aren't just big, they're huge: the four biggest each have a capital value of more than \u00a31 trillion. Add the five biggest together, and the sum is four times the value of Britain's GDP. Our (remaining) banks have less exposure to the famous toxic debt than their US counterparts, but while the wholesale money markets aren't functioning, normal banking life is impossible. They are highly leveraged, too. It was this combination of size and leverage that did for Iceland's banks. The ratio of Barclays' assets to its equity in June hit 61.3 to 1. Imagine that for a moment translated to your own finances, so that you could stretch what you actually own to borrow more than 60 times the amount. (I'd have an island. What about you?) It sounds sensible to reduce that leverage, and indeed it is, except that the process of reducing it is the dreaded \"deleveraging\" that is causing the banking system and the wider economy to grind to a halt. The scale of bank leveraging is one of the things that must be targeted by regulators if/when the crisis has passed; we can't let the banks get this far out of control ever again. There must be a tight limit on the relationship between banks' debt and their equity, and much greater transparency about the nature of banks' \"assets\".</p> <p>So: a huge unregulated boom in which almost all the upside went directly into private hands, followed by a gigantic bust in which the losses were socialised. That is nobody's idea of how the financial system is supposed to work. It is just as much an abomination to the free marketeer as it is to the social democrat or outright leftist. But the alternatives don't seem to be forthcoming: there is a theoretical vacuum where the challenge from the left used to be. Capitalism no longer has a global antagonist, when it has never needed one more - if only to clarify thinking and values, and to provide the chorus of Schadenfreude that at this moment is deeply appropriate. I would be providing it myself if I weren't so frightened.</p> <p>Having fully indulged their greed on the way up, and created the risks, the bankers are now fully indulging their fear on the way down, and allowing the system to seize up. But it wasn't just the banks. One thing that has been lacking in public discourse about the crisis is someone to point out that we did this to ourselves, because we were greedy and stupid. It's not just bankers who have been indulging in greed, short-termism and fantasy economics. In addition to our stretched mortgage borrowing, Britain has half of the total European credit-card debt. We grew obsessed with the price of our houses, felt richer than we should, borrowed money we didn't have, and now that the downturn has happened - as it was bound to do - we want someone else to blame. Bankers are to blame, but we're to blame too. That's just as well, because we're the ones who are going to have to pay.</p> <p>Other than that, it's too early to draw general conclusions from this amazing crisis. What must die is the mystical belief in the power of the markets that has dominated political and economic discourse in most of the western world for the past several decades. The markets have, so flagrantly malfunctioned that we can't go back to the idea of unfettered liberal capitalism as a talisman, template or magic wand. Unquestioned Cityphilia is gone, I hope for ever. Unfortunately, we have no model of where to go from here, apart from a more heavily regulated form of growth-based liberal capitalism. There will be more intrusive regulation, more proactive interference. There may even be (there should be) a new system to control the global flow of capital. That doesn't seem enough, but in the absence of another set of ideas about how the world should work, it may turn out to be what we have to settle for. In the meantime, it's seatbelt sign on, sick bag to hand, and that deep, bitter, prayerful longing for smooth air.</p> <p>\u2022 This is an edited version of an article that appears in the current issue of the London Review of Books (<a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk\">lrb.co.uk</a>)</p>",
  "<p>Asked at what stage his club's targets would start to change this season, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/hullcity\">Hull City</a> manager Phil Brown smiled and prevaricated. \"People talk about bubbles bursting but if we lose, my answer is we'll simply look to blow another,\" he shrugged. As long as their opposition continue to give the impression they have not only under-estimated the Tigers but that they have not bothered to do their homework, Hull will continue to pick up points. </p> <p>That the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a> newcomers continue to disrupt the hegemony of the big four says almost as much about failings, and perhaps attitude, of the teams they have played as it is does about their own undoubted qualities. With Marlon King coming through a fitness test, Brown was able to name the same side, and formation, with Geovanni playing directly behind King and Daniel Cousin, which had been successful at both the Emirates and White Hart Lane. </p> <p>Given that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/westhamunited\">Hammers'</a> front line saw Craig Bellamy and Matthew Etherington featuring on either side of Carlton Cole, it seemed unlikely that the ball would spend too much time in midfield, an impression which proved accurate in an opening quarter during which, if City had the majority of possession, much the better football was played by the visitors.</p> <p>It should have been rewarded after 15 minutes when Bellamy followed a run down the left with a cross which found Cole unmarked eight yards from goal, only for the striker to steer his shot straight at Hull goalkeeper Boaz Myhill, who saved with ease.</p> <p>If City were being out-passed they were still offering an occasional threat. Dean Marney, running from deep on to Cousin's cross from the left, volleyed a few feet wide and a minute later the same player fired a 25-yarder over, but the fact both efforts came from breaks was indicative of West Ham's increasing dominance. </p> <p>Having already put the ball in the net illegitimately, though cleverly, after nipping the ball off Myhill in mid-clearance - and having been booked for his pains - left-back Herita Ilunga timed his run to meet Mark Noble's corner perfectly, only to head wide from little more than six yards. West Ham should still have gone in ahead though, after Cole headed Noble's cross neatly into the path of Bellamy. Not for the first time in his career, the Wales forward failed to keep his head down, shooting wildly over. </p> <p>Strangely flat during the first period, Hull began the second at a different tempo. George Boateng and King both shot wide before they took the lead with a goal - from West Ham's point of view - of depressing simplicity. Andy Dawson swung in a corner from the right and Michael Turner jumped higher than Matthew Upson to head past Robert Green.</p> <p>Turner had scored in the same way in his team's previous outing here, against Everton, but that was a match in which Hull led by two before being pegged back. A solitary goal looked unlikely to be enough yet West Ham continued to spurn chances. Cole followed a muscular run down the left with a cross which Etherington volleyed into the side-netting and Noble's free-kick from 20 yards failed to beat the wall as the visitors struggled to unlock Hull's resilient defence.</p> <p>\"We knew they are dangerous at set-pieces but sometimes very difficult to stop,\" said Gianfranco Zola, the West Ham manager. \"I'm not disappointed about the goal, I'm more disappointed about missing all the chances we created. It can happen in a match like this that you concede from a free-kick or a corner kick but when you create as many chances as we did you need to score. That's what's missing from the team at the moment but I totally trust the players to get it right.\" </p> <p>In the meantime Brown continues to prove himself a more astute tactician than many suspected. \"I thought at half-time we could play more football and because we weren't, we were giving the ball away too cheaply,\" he said. \"Consequently we had to sacrifice Geovanni behind the front two and play him out wide, because whenever you give possession away, your system will fail, simple as that. </p> <p>\"We decided to go more in the faces of the West Ham players higher up the field. I thought we'd dropped off too much, given them a bit too much respect, and as a good football team they were causing us problems. Cousin and King started engaging their centre-halves earlier, and that made it easier for our three in midfield.\"</p> <p>Operating on the right of a three-man midfield, Marney's workrate and distribution were exceptional, driving his team forward and covering in front of the back four<br><strong><br>Man of the match:</strong> Dean Marney</p> <p><strong>Best moment </strong>Unlucky not to score when he volleyed Daniel Cousin's cross wide</p>",
  "<p>Only in the US has the political fallout from the financial meltdown been more visceral than in Scotland. Americans have a presidential election to worry about. But the Scots have two of their biggest, most cherished national institutions at risk: RBS and HBOS. In the 1690s a bank crisis pushed Scotland into union with England. Does 2008's crisis threaten the SNP's vision of renewed independence ?</p> <p>Labour and the SNP are so scornful of each other's analysis that there must be votes at stake. Sure enough, there are. On November 6 six candidates are contesting Labour-held Glenrothes in Fife (Labour majority 10,664), next door to Gordon Brown's seat. It will be the first reality check for the new Brown, or \"Fife man saves world\", as Labour canvassers remind voters on the doorstep.</p> <p>Two soundbites encapsulate the dispute. The SNP has rested much of its case for independence on high prices for Scotland's oil and on the wealth-creating splendour of its two great banks. RBS's HQ near Edinburgh airport looks like a city. </p> <p>Alex Salmond, the first minister, has cited the so-called northern \"arc of prosperity\" - from Ireland to Finland via Iceland and Norway as all small countries doing well: we can too, he says.</p> <p>Now things look different. Iceland has gone bust, Ireland has cut spending and raised taxes to pay for its unilateral bank bail-out. Even Norway's famous oil fund has shrunk as stocks, as well as oil prices, tumble. After a Scots columnist coined the phrase \"arc of insolvency\" Jim Murphy, the new and keen Scottish secretary, adopted it. </p> <p>Gordon Brown weighed in to emphasise how an independent Scotland simply couldn't have done what the UK has done. The \u00a332bn sought by HBOS and RBS exceeds the Salmond government's total budget (\u00a331bn). Scottish banks' share of the overall package is estimated at \u00a3100bn, Scotland's GDP. </p> <p>Salmond (once an RBS economist) tried to blame the crisis on short-selling \"spivs and speculators.\" But everyone knows RBS overreached itself.</p> <p>Salmond is not a man to roll over and expire. He has challenged Brown to debate the economy \"toe to toe\" (knowing he will refuse) and has called for reflation and interest rate cuts.</p> <p>Sensitive to London parochialism, SNP strategists accuse Labour of a patronising reflex which depicts helpless Scots as \"Albanians of the north\". So Scots are leading efforts to save HBOS from merger with Lloyds. </p> <p>As Scottish unemployment rose sharply to 124,000 last week, Platinum Point, another luxury flat project outside Edinburgh, went bust. </p> <p>Brown is determined that Lindsay Roy (head of his old school) holds Glenrothes against Peter Grant, SNP leader of Fife council. </p> <p>He will not stay away as he did when Labour lost Glasgow East in July. Labour voters are coming back, say canvassers. The stakes are high and a lot can happen in a fortnight, especially this one.</p>",
  "<p>Last week the eyes of the financial world turned to Britain as the government announced radical action to restore confidence in our banking system, prevent the failure of some of our most important banks and shore up our financial markets against the worst effects of the global financial crisis.</p> <p>I had joined the government just a week before, as part of the team of Treasury ministers led by Alistair Darling. As a new junior minister with a commercial background, I was asked to support discussions that would shape a deal to recapitalise some of our largest banks, inject liquidity into the system and unfreeze the interbank lending market that feeds mortgages and loans to small business.</p> <p>Much media attention focused on the details of these discussions and the subsequent deal. Little attention has yet been given to the wider arguments for such unprecedented action and what it means for our financial system.</p> <p>Action to support banks is not an end in itself. A sound banking system is an essential part of the everyday lives of every family and every business in the country, and an essential precondition for the long-term health of the economy. Yet over the past few weeks the global banking system in effect ceased to function, with the cost at which banks lend to each other reaching an all-time high and the market effectively frozen. If banks stop lending to each other, it is not just banks but families and homeowners that suffer, and many businesses face failure. If the government hadn't taken significant action, the costs to families and businesses would have been far higher.</p> <p>There are three key elements to what was announced last week. The first and most urgent involves providing short-term funds to the financial system, by expanding the Bank of England's special liquidity scheme to at least \u00a3200bn. Second, to put banks on a more secure footing, we have offered to invest directly. Third, to support the lending between banks that feeds new mortgages and loans to businesses, we are providing a credit guarantee to banks that have agreed to raise their capital to a sufficiently high level. We agreed to make investments in RBS, and upon their successful merger, HBOS and Lloyds TSB, totalling \u00a337bn. Five other banks and building societies have committed to raise over \u00a312bn from other sources.</p> <p>In all of these measures we have been guided by three principles: maintaining stability and restoring confidence to our financial system; protecting savers and depositors; and safeguarding the taxpayers' interests. We will manage our investment in banks on a commercial basis and get a commercial return for our support. Any additional borrowing and debt is in return for assets, charged at commercial rates or in the form of temporary loans. And in return for our investment conditions are attached on dividends and bonuses paid to board members and on maintaining the availability of competitively priced lending to homeowners and small businesses.</p> <p>By taking this action now, we can prevent serious risks to the rest of the economy. But significant global challenges remain. So in implementing these measures the government will do whatever else is necessary to stabilise the system, support the economy through these difficult times, and build a strong and stable system for the future.</p> <p>But no country can solve this global crisis on its own. Other countries are now implementing plans similar to ours. It's no surprise. Since 1997, the UK has been at the forefront of reform and innovation in the international community. We were among the first governments to call for greater international cooperation and an early warning system in international financial risk.</p> <p>Collective action should not be restricted to dealing with the consequences of this global crisis - governments also have to act together to prevent future ones. This will require a comprehensive approach. Last week European leaders backed the proposals put forward by the prime minister based on five principles: transparency in relation to risks in the system; absence of conflicts in the system; responsibility of managers for risks they undertake; sound banking practices with respect to risk and capital adequacy; and coordination across borders in recognition of the increasing global nature of markets. Quick progress is needed on all these.</p> <p>It is clear that the global financial system will emerge from this difficult period much changed. But by taking decisive action domestically, and by leading the debate on a new approach internationally, the UK will remain a world leader in financial services. The fundamentals that underpinned our successes over the last decade have not changed - a talented workforce, world-class infrastructure and an internationalism and openness unmatched by other financial centres. These factors will put us on a stronger footing than ever in the newly shaped world of financial services. As City minister, my priority is to bring stability to the system. My ambition is to keep our banks among the strongest in the world. Our economy will welcome it. It deserves nothing less.</p> <p>\u2022 Paul Myners is City minister and former chairman of Guardian Media Group</p>",
  "<p>An encounter overflowing with incident, including two goals presented to the home side by Marcus Hahnemann, ended with Reading's brothers Stephen and Noel Hunt involved in an altercation with a steward which expresssed the visitors' frustration at leaving Deepdale as losers of a game they had controlled for so long. The pair vehemently argued with and jostled the official until players from both sides stepped in to calm events down.</p> <p>\"[The steward] came on and was a bit aggressive. It was a heat of the moment thing and it is all forgotten about now,\" Noel said before going on to blame Preston's perceived abuse of the multi-ball system as the reason behind the affair. \"We thought the ball should have been thrown back quicker but it was heat of the moment and we were a bit upset. They slowed the game down and it worked.\"</p> <p>Preston's manager, Alan Irvine, was understandably more eager to applaud the victory that ended a four-match losing streak, particularly as it came against a Reading side on a three-game winning run. \"I am delighted because I certainly felt we'd lost a bit of an edge in recent weeks, which in this division is enough to make the difference between winning and losing,\" he said. \"I thought we had our edge back and, if we hadn't, then Reading would certainly have beaten us.\"</p> <p>The Hunts had earlier combined in the 27th minute to give Reading the lead. Noel shimmied his way into the box and after Sean St Ledger made slight contact the referee, Nigel Miller, awarded a generous penalty that Stephen converted. Reading went looking for a second to kill off the contest but, despite their attractive movement, it would not arrive. Noel Hunt hit the post and the Preston goalkeeper, Andy Lonergan, also had to be sharp to the constant threat posed to his goalmouth.</p> <p>After the break Preston again did not look like scoring - so Ivar Ingimarsson generously did it for them. Ten minutes after the restart Hahnemann completely missed a Chris Sedgwick cross and the ball hit the Icelandic defender on the side and bobbled into the net.</p> <p>Preston seized on the mistake and began to take control of the match. Jon Parkin went close with a 25-yard strike which hit the bar and saw a glancing header drift narrowly wide. As the game progressed they continued to press forward and finally found the winner thanks to more altruism from Hahnemann with nine minutes left. The American flapped at a Ross Wallace corner allowing Stephen Elliott, on his first start since moving from Wolves, to poke home from five yards.</p> <p>The action did not end there, though, as Reading had a late penalty appeal rejected, Noel Hunt again hit the post and a last-gasp shot from Liam Rosenior was somehow cleared off the line by Youl Mawene. For Steve Coppell's side it just was not meant to be.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Noel Hunt (Reading)</p>",
  "<p>Sitting in the press room, Wasps' coaches, Ian McGeechan and Shaun Edwards, could hardly have looked more depressed had their side been dumped out of the Heineken Cup. Perhaps they felt that had just happened, for the English champions have given Leinster control of Pool Two. </p> <p>Even if Wasps are back on track by the time these sides meet again, at Twickenham on January 17, they trail Leinster 6-1 on try count. Remarkably, in a very competitive contest on Saturday, Leinster had their bonus point sorted by the hour. Thereafter Wasps collapsed. </p> <p>\"I thought Leinster were by far the more dominant side, particularly in the last half-hour,\" Edwards said. \"I'm a big believer that rugby is a game of momentum and the momentum was with Leinster with those two charged-down tries.\"</p> <p>There was also a try from a straightforward spillage by Tom Palmer to help get Leinster motoring. The Irish side do have injury issues, however: their captain, Leo Cullen, is out with a broken collarbone and Brian O'Driscoll has a knee injury, though it is likely to rule him out only for the game against Glasgow on Friday.</p> <p>O'Driscoll scored twice in the opening half-hour but his side, who dominated the game, only led 15-11 at the break, after failing to take advantage while the Wasps prop Phil Vickery was in the sin-bin for a professional foul.</p> <p>\"At 15-11 there was everything to play for,\" said McGeechan. \"We started the second half with a couple of errors and Leinster finished one on the turnover.

  "<p>A scoreless match will always dress the most thrilling of exchanges in the drabbest of clothes. Yet even though this was entertaining - as far as goalless games go - it was a reminder that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham\">Fulham</a> could face another season of toil beside the river despite their encouraging start.</p> <p>Their manager Roy Hodgson's expression was as forlorn as someone searching the gutter for dog-ends when he attempted to salvage some good news out of this match.At least his players had ended a run of four defeats in all competitions but, with five goals from their seven <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a> games, and only one in their past four, it is not difficult to see where Fulham's problems lie. Brian McBride, with his prodigious jumping and goal-scoring, is remembered more fondly than ever.</p> <p>\"It was important today to put a stop to defeat by the odd goal,\" said Hodgson. \"Each defeat we've had has been by the odd goal and two of them have been 1-0. I think we will be away from the bottom bunch this year. A lot will change in this league. We've played seven out of 38. I think both these clubs have got teams which are better and have more chance of staying in the Premier League than last year.\"</p> <p>Fulham's forward pair of Andrew Johnson and Bobby Zamora gave <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland\">Sunderland</a> few problems, though. \"It's not for want of trying or producing chances,\" said Hodgson. \"You are more concerned when you're not scoring goals and not posing a threat for the opposing defence but that wasn't the case today and it wasn't the case against West Ham. We posed plenty of threat to their goal.\"</p> <p>That threat did not include striking the post twice or being denied by the crossbar as Sunderland managed. Roy Keane's side were unlucky not to take all the points after a second-half free-kick from Kieran Richardson which beat the wall and the goalkeeper was ruled out because of a foul by Pascal Chimbonda.</p> <p>Keane said: \"I knew that playing two up front would put our back four under more pressure than in recent weeks when I've had a player sitting in midfield who has given them a lot of protection.\" With the Fulham forwards out of sorts it was not much of a gamble. \"I am fairly pleased with a point because we could have been out there all night and probably not scored,\" Keane added. </p> <p>Sunderland will go into their match at home against Newcastle on Saturday with some confidence after having the better of the match. \"In these derby games form and whatever goes on in the background goes out the back window,\" Keane added. </p> <p>\"We came unstuck against Newcastle last year and I watched them a couple of weeks ago when they were unlucky not to win. But next Saturday is a chance to beat another Premier League team and give our fans something to shout about. I don't think they will be too disappointed today because they can see the progress we're making. Anybody who knows anything about football can see we've improved a hell of a lot over the past six, 12, 24 months and hopefully that will continue.\"</p> <p>Keane, though, promised more stability. \"I've tended to make lots and lots of changes over the past one or two years. My spending is over, certainly in terms of bringing in six, seven or eight players in every transfer window. I know the players are thinking that it would be nice to have some sort of settled team. They would like to get to know each other.\"</p> <p><strong>Man of the match:</strong> Kieran Richardson (Sunderland)</p>",

  "<p>ING, the Dutch savings bank which has more than a million savers in the UK, is to get a \u20ac10bn capital injection from the Netherlands authorities, the latest bank to be affected by the global credit crisis.</p> <p>ING is the Netherlands' largest listed bank, with 85m customers worldwide, and is one of the world's top 20 financial institutions. It operates under its own name in this country, and recently took control of 180,000 accounts from failed Icelandic banks Kaupthing Singer &amp; Friedlander and Heritable Bank. </p> <p>ING has grown strongly in the UK on the back of its well-received savings products and has become a household name, regularly appearing in best-buy tables. It also took over the failed UK investment bank Barings in the 1990s.</p> <p>At a press conference tonight the Dutch finance minister, Wouter Bos, said the government would get preference shares in ING worth \u20ac10bn in return for the cash injection. The shares will pay the government annual interest of 8.5%. </p> <p>The Dutch government will also appoint two members of the bank's supervisory board - the equivalent of its board of directors. The bank is scrapping its dividend payout to shareholders and its senior executives have agreed to forfeit their annual bonuses and limit their pay-offs to a maximum of one year's salary. </p> <p>ING said it would now review pay packages for the board and senior managers to link incentive schemes \"to long term value creation and risk\"</p> <p>The funds will push up its so-called Tier 1 capital ratio to around 8% from 6.5% now. The Dutch government recently announced it had set aside \u20ac20bn to support Netherlands banks if necessary and ING is the first to apply for aid.</p> <p>The capital injection is similar to those carried out by other governments around the world who have coordinated policy to try and prevent a general collapse of the global banking system. </p> <p>In a statement ING said it \"appreciates the measures the Dutch government is taking to boost confidence and stabillity in the Dutch financial system\".</p> <p>Until recently ING had insisted that its declining profits were mainly a result of losses on its investments in shares, rather than losses related to US sub-prime mortgages. But it has clearly been hit by the general loss of confidence and falling share prices that have affected other banks so deeply.</p> <p>On Friday, ING warned that it expected to post a \u20ac500m loss for the third quarter of the year, its first such loss since being formed in 1991 and one which sent its shares down 27% to a 13-year low.</p> <p>The move could send new tremors through European banking shares when markets open tomorrow, because ING has until now been seen as being more robust than Belgian-Dutch rival Fortis, which was rescued last month by the Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourg governments.</p>",
  "<p>Apropos my vexed post from yesterday about not being able to decide whom to root for as Michigan faced Penn State, my ever-alert sister-in-law, C.K., dropped me an email to remind me that Jay Paterno, Joe's son and the Nittany Lions' quarterbacks coach, came out for Obama last spring. From the <a href=\"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2008/03/republican_joepas_son_backs_ob.html\">Harrisburg Patriot-News last March</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Penn State quarterbacks coach Jay Paterno, a son of head coach Joe Paterno, is backing Democratic Sen. Barack Obama. </p> <p>Joe Paterno is a friend of President Bush, and his son Scott is a Republican who unsuccessfully ran for a congressional seat. </p> <p>\"I brought my kids up to think for themselves since day one,\" Joe Paterno said. \"... It's interesting. I got a son who's a Republican, who ran for Congress, Scott. I'm a Republican. I've got a son, Jay, who's for Obama. I've got a daughter, who I'm pretty sure she's going to be for Hillary. So God bless America.\"</p> <p>Joe Paterno said he thought long and hard before deciding against greeting Bill Clinton when the former president visited the campus on behalf of his wife's presidential campaign.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jay Paterno has been quite open about his Obama fandom. Again, in the interest of even-handedness, I reiterate that I don't think it's such a great idea for sports coaches in particular to be expressing political preferences. Coaches represent programs and universities at the college level in a way players, who will be gone in four years, do not. Fans come in all ideologies, and so I take the general view that sports should be one arena in which we can high-five and embrace people we might otherwise, in a political context, prefer to punch in the mouth. Having said that, I'd imagine that most coaches are pretty right-wing, so I don't mind seeing one who has the cojones to say he's a Democrat.</p> <p>By the way, Penn State won, 46-17. I can't say that the sight of the long face on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Rodriguez\">the Great Satan</a> as time wore down disturbed me any.<br></p>",

  "<p>Alex Salmond today directly blamed Gordon Brown for creating the economic \"calamity\" that has forced the government to find \u00a3200bn to bail-out the UK's banks.</p> <p>The Scottish National party leader ended an uneasy truce between the two leaders during the banking crisis by calling Brown a \"sub-prime minister who was guilty of \"presiding over the biggest economic reverse for a generation\".</p> <p>He called on the chancellor, Alistair Darling, to block the sale of HBOS to Lloyds TSB to see if HBOS could survive on its own, now that the banking sector has been flooded with emergency funds. \"It does not deserve to be cast aside as a consequence of the age of irresponsibility,\" he said.</p> <p>Salmond, speaking to close his party's annual conference in Perth today, also tried to quash growing doubts about the case for Scottish independence, which were fuelled last week by the prime minister.</p> <p>He rejected repeated claims by the Labour leader and the new Scottish secretary, Jim Murphy, that the banking crises in Iceland, Ireland and Norway were powerful evidence against a separate Scotland.</p> <p>With the exception of Iceland, Salmond said, many of northern Europe's smaller nations were projected by the International Monetary Fund to escape a forthcoming recession. In contrast, the UK was expected \"to tumble into the economic mire\".</p> <p>The prime minister had \"almost broken our banking system\" by failing to control the excesses of the hedge funds, by allowing assets to be massively overvalued and removing legal controls on the financial sector during his 11 years in Downing Street.</p> <p>The UK government, Salmond continued, should press for deeper cuts in interest rates, cut taxes on domestic energy bills and increase spending on major public capital projects to reflate the economy.</p> <p>He accused Brown of overseeing a boom and bust made in London, creating a bust which \"almost broke our banks\". Scotland's greatest company \u2013 Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 had been forced to give the UK government preference shares of 12% and allowed HBOS, Scotland's oldest bank, to be bought by Lloyds TSB.</p> <p>\"The prime minister thinks this is an advert for the union?\" he asked. \"I would have thought that the condition of the economy, the fears of our people, the state of the financial sector, are a staggering condemnation of the state of the United Kingdom.\"</p> <p>Iain Gray, the Scottish Labour party leader, retorted that Salmond had shown a \"failure of leadership \u2026 He clung to the politics of grievance and indulged in a blame game. He called for a new age of responsibility. Yet he dodged his today.\"</p> <p>Salmond had himself said an independent Scotland would run the banking system with \"light touch\" regulation, and had last year criticised UK ministers for being too heavy handed with the City.</p> <p>Salmond's speech has come at a crucial time for his government in Edinburgh and his party, with just over two weeks of campaigning left in the Glenrothes byelection \u2013 a seat that borders Brown's own constituency and home town of Kirkcaldy.</p> <p>Labour sources believe the prime minister's recent performance has greatly increased Labour's chances of retaining Glenrothes on November 6, despite a potent campaign by the SNP, which has the equivalent Scottish parliament seat.</p> <p>However, Salmond appeared to admit his government was powerless to meaningfully intervene in the economy and relied instead on the UK government in London to use its powers to regenerate the </p> <p>His only new policy announcement was that a pilot project to help build shared-equity homes for first time buyers would now get \u00a360m a year, and be spread Scotland-wide. </p> <p>In addition, tens of thousands of small businesses would see their rates cut, and ministers would continue to press the UK government to release \u00a31bn in funds held by the Treasury and organisations such as Ofgem. </p> <p>The electricity regulator holds \u00a3120m in Scotland's share of the fossil fuel levy for renewable energy projects, but Treasury rules state that money cannot be used as extra revenue by the Scottish government. This meant new green power projects were being stifled. </p> <p>\"The reason that the SNP is trusted by the people is that they know in good times and in tough times, Scotland's party put Scotland first and will not take no for an answer,\" he said.\"</p>",
  "<p>When the Republic of Korea was established in 1948, Korea was one of the poorest countries in the world. GDP per capita was US$67 in 1953, immediately following the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War\">Korean War</a>, and rose to only US$79 in 1960. At that time, North Korea's economy was much stronger than that of the south. Natural resources were abundant in the north, and even electricity was supplied from north to south. Most industry was located in the north, whereas the south was mainly agricultural. </p> <p>Today, the south's GDP is 40 times larger than that of the north. Comparing the two Korean economies is virtually meaningless. </p> <p>Such disparities do not arise from different historical experiences, because Koreans have shared a history for thousands of years as one nation. The gap, instead, reflects recent historical choices. </p> <p>By persistently adhering to a planned economy and obsolete ideology, North Korea is trapped in a vicious cycle, suffering from unstable food supplies and low, or sometimes negative, economic growth. Nonetheless, North Korea has shown little interest in reform. Instead, it has developed a nuclear weapons program that threatens stability in the region and places a heavy burden on its economy. </p> <p>South Korea, which is enjoying unprecedented prosperity, is becoming increasingly uncomfortable with North Koreans' economic despair. Probably no two neighbouring countries have such a huge economic gap, let alone countries that share the same ethnic and historical background. The danger is that such a discrepancy can become a source of instability and conflict. </p> <p>To overcome its economic deficiencies and attain social stability, the north has no choice but to abandon its nuclear weapons programme and move toward reforms and greater openness. South Korea is trying to persuade the north to make this strategic decision. </p> <p>We in South Korea are more than willing to help the north achieve economic growth, which is almost always the source of peace and security. North Korea's economic recovery is vital for an enduring peace on the Korean peninsula. </p> <p>So, in accordance with the Six-Party Talks (North and South Korea, the United States, Russia, China, and Japan) my government wants to create a Korean Economic Community in collaboration with the north. In cooperation with the international community, we will help North Korea raise its annual per capita income to US$3,000. To this end, we will carry out joint projects in five key areas: education, finance, industrial infrastructure, quality of life, and economic development. But an institutional mechanism is needed to implement this initiative, such as an inter-Korean consultative body. </p> <p>Of course, mere economic assistance or investment is not sufficient for a country to bail itself out of the vicious circle of underdevelopment and poverty. A national economy can take off only when the necessary infrastructure, an adequate level of competition, and reasonable government policies are in place. We know how difficult it is to achieve such conditions, because we had to do it ourselves. Our vision for an inter-Korean economic community is based on sharing our experiences with the north. </p> <p>True, inter-Korean relations have already expanded. But this expansion has not brought fundamental change to the two Koreas' relationship. An incident at Mt Geumgang last July demonstrated the relationship's vulnerable nature. A middle-aged South Korean female tourist was shot to death while walking on the beach, having inadvertently crossed over the boundary of the tourist zone. No North-South dialogue has emerged to investigate the incident, or to prevent a recurrence. </p> <p>Under these circumstances, there are greater calls in South Korea for a new approach towards the North. We now believe that inter-Korean relations should conform to principles and standards that any member of the international community should respect. </p> <p>Another key consideration is to consolidate a sustainable peace structure on the Korean peninsula. This cannot merely be a state of affairs like the current one, in which hostilities are absent. It refers to an enduring peace, which is not easily affected by incidents or accidents and is able to prevent politico-military crises such as that caused by the north's nuclear program. The only way to realise such a peace is by completing North Korea's denuclearisation and establishing a peace regime on the Korean peninsula. </p> <p>As of today, the Six-Party Talks is the principal framework to open up the future of the north. If the north abandons its nuclear weapons programme, many benefits can be gained. Relations between the north and its neighbours can improve, along with a greater probability of forming a Northeast Asia peace and security mechanism. </p> <p>Fortunately, America's removal of North Korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism has re-started the denuclearisation process. But the North's prior threat to resume work at the facilities suggests that this process may be fitful. </p> <p>Moreover, since South Korea's new government took office earlier this year little progress has been made in relations between the two Koreas. But our vision will eventually open up ways to solve North Korea's problems, not only bringing a better future for the north, but also making the Korean peninsula a gateway for peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia. </p> <p>Leaders in the north may mistakenly believe that they can circumvent or outmanoeuvre the south \u2013 the so-called strategy of driving a wedge between the Republic of Korea and the US. But in the end, South Korea is the neighbour whom the north can truly trust and rely on the most. The north should realise this and make a wise choice. </p> <p><em>Han Seung-soo is prime minister of South Korea. </em></p> <p><em>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>/Asia Society, 2008.</em></p>",
  "<p>Voters in key swing states from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/colorado\">Colorado</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ohio\">Ohio</a> have been targeted with automated phone calls seeking to portray Barack Obama as an extremist who has befriended terrorists and Hollywood celebrities.</p> <p>Opening with the words, \"Hello. I'm calling for<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\"> John McCain</a> and the RNC,\" the robocalls have sparked a political storm, with Democrats and some <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/republicans\">Republicans</a> denouncing the McCain campaign for resorting to a tactic the candidate himself has consistently repudiated.</p> <p>Several versions of the calls, addressing topics from abortion to terrorism, were reported by voters in Ohio, Colorado, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/newmexico\">New Mexico</a>, Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/virginia\">Virginia</a>, Missouri, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/northcarolina\">North Carolina</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/florida\">Florida</a>, Texas, West Virginia, Maine and Georgia.</p> <p>One robocall, focusing on Republican allegations that Obama is close to the 1960s radical William Ayers, states: \"You need to know that Barack Obama has worked closely with domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, whose organization bombed the US Capitol, the Pentagon, a judge's home, and killed Americans. And Democrats will enact an extreme leftist agenda if they take control of Washington.\"</p> <p>Ayers, who served on the board of a nonprofit organisation in Chicago with Obama, co-founded the radical leftwing organisation Weather Underground, which was behind a bombing campaign in the late 1960s and 1970s. The only people who were killed in the campaign were three members of the group, who died in a bomb-making accident. Obama has criticised the \"despicable acts\" of the group.</p> <p>Another of the automated Republican calls states: \"Barack Obama and his fellow Democrats got caught putting Hollywood above America. On the very day our elected leaders gathered in Washington to deal with the financial crisis, Barack Obama spent just 20 minutes with economic advisers, but hours at a celebrity Hollywood fundraiser. Where are the Democrats' priorities?\"</p> <p>A third call reprised an attack delivered the day before, in the final presidential debate: \"You need to know that Barack Obama ... opposed a bill requiring doctors to care for babies born alive after surviving attempted abortions ... Barack Obama and his liberal Democrats are too extreme for America.\"</p> <p>The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, expressed his surprise at the \"scummy\" tactics being used by the McCain campaign, saying: \"[I] can't believe John McCain knows what's going on.\"</p> <p>\"These kind of tactics have no place in Maine politics,\" said a spokesman for the Maine Republican senator Susan Collins. \"Senator Collins urges the McCain campaign to stop these calls immediately.\" Collins is engaged in a tough re-election battle in the state.</p> <p>Critics of the McCain campaign's use of robocalls noted McCain's professed opposition to the tactic was underpinned by the belief his defeat in the 2000 Republican presidential primary campaign was due in part to the use of such tactics by his rival, George Bush.</p> <p>While that election was tightening, voters in South Carolina received robocalls asking: \"Would you be more or less likely to vote for John McCain ... if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate black child?\"</p> <p>The allegation, rooted in McCain's adoption of a girl from Bangladesh, paid off and Bush took South Carolina. Bush's campaign was orchestrated in part by the former South Carolina attorney general Charlie Condon. Earlier this year, Condon was appointed chair of McCain's South Carolina campaign.</p> <p>This week's calls, as with those made for the Bush campaign in 2000, were reportedly the work of a company owned by a Republican consultant named Jeff Larson.</p> <p>An Obama campaign spokesman told the New York Times the use of robocalls reminiscent of the 2000 campaign showed, \"just how much Senator McCain has changed since then - adopting not only President Bush's policies but his tactics.\"</p> <p>But a spokesman for the McCain campaign defended the calls, telling the paper, \"I would argue that much of these calls are based on hardened facts that American voters should consider.\"</p> <p>During this year's Republican primary, McCain's campaign manager, Steve Schmidt, decried robocalls. \"So it's a conveyance to introduce new information - and a lot of that information on the phone is slanderous and smearing,\" he said. \"But if not enough about who the person is, or what they're about, is known, is the criteria for it working. When you're a defined entity like [McCain] is now, they have a very minimal effect.\"</p>",
  "<p>David Wallace touched down with 14 minutes remaining to hand the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/heinekencup\">Heineken Cup</a> holders <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/munster\"><strong>Munster</strong></a> victory after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/salesharks\"><strong>Sale Sharks</strong></a> staged a brave second-half fightback in today's pool one encounter. Munster led 13-6 at the break and looked to be in total control but the Sharks hit back and the scores were locked at 16-16 when the Limerick-born flanker crossed in the right corner to edge the visitors back in front.</p> <p>The Magners League outfit were forced to play out the remaining eight the minutes with 14 men after the centre Lifeimi Mafi was sin-binned for a high tackle on Sharks replacement Mathew Tait. That made for a fraught ending but the reigning European champions - who beat Toulouse at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium in last season's final - had the final say when Ronan O'Gara claimed a drop-goal from distance to leave the visitors home and dry.</p> <p>The Irishmen confirmed their pedigree with a stellar first-half display which should have reaped far greater reward than only one try from the full-back Paul Warwick. A 13-6 interval advantage in the visitors' favour did scant justice to their dominance of a Sale side who could not back up their impressive demolition of Clermont Auvergne.</p> <p>The manner of the Sharks' 32-15 success in France last weekend - when they outscored last season's French Championship runners-up 4-0 on tries - was supposed to be a major statement of their title intent. However the Guinness Premiership outfit were second-best throughout the opening 40 minutes and struggled to cope with Munster's marauding backline. O'Gara and Tomas O'Leary dovetailed effectively and their potent half-back partnership offered the likes of Keith Earls and Mafi the opportunity to showcase their running skills from deep.</p> <p>Sale began encouragingly enough - Luke McAlister missed a penalty and then converted one to put his side 3-0 ahead after three minutes - but Munster soon began to move through the gears. A penalty from O'Gara drew them level in the 11th minute and five minutes later they conjured a delightful try with O'Gara finding Alan Quinlan with a neat short offload to his left and he in turn found Warwick who crossed in the corner. O'Gara added the extras and Munster threatened to run riot with a series of outstanding moves from the middle of the park.</p> <p>In the 20th minute, a brilliant long-range drop-goal from Warwick extended their lead and then came close to doing likewise with another similar effort that fell just short. McAlister's second penalty kept Sale in contention at 13-6 at half-time and the in-form Kiwi's brilliant dummy and underarm offload almost put Neil Briggs clear shortly before the break.</p> <p>Another penalty from O'Gara extended Munster's lead shortly after the restart but Sale were undaunted and they drew level by the 57th minute. First, McAlister's third penalty cut the deficit by three points and then excellent work from Chris Jones allowed Dean Schofield to bustle clear for a try which McAlister converted.</p> <p>O'Gara then missed a penalty but he orchestrated the move that Wallace finished off and although O'Gara could not convert the try - and Mafi was sent to the bin in the 72nd minute - Munster held firm.</p> <p>The influential O'Gara claimed a late drop-goal as Munster ended the game strongly in front of a crowd of 10,928 - Sale's biggest-ever attendance.</p> <p>In pool five, the match between <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/bath\">Bath</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/newportdragons\">Newport Gwent Dragons</a></strong> at the Recreation Ground took a while to get going before the home side rallied in the second half to win 13-9. The wing Andrew Higgins came off the bench to rescue Bath's campaign with a 67th-minute try that finally broke the Welsh side's resistance.</p> <p>By any measure it was an extraordinary defensive effort that held the Guinness Premiership leaders at bay for more than an hour, during which the visitors also lost two players to the sin-bin. Two Butch James penalties kept Bath's noses in front throughout the first half but even after Higgins' try, converted by James, the Welsh side came back with two penalties from Shaun Connor to claim a precious bonus point. </p>",
  "<p>It was only last December that Gordon Brown demonstrated his ardour for Europe by signing the Lisbon Treaty in splendid isolation, two hours after his fellow <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu\">EU</a> leaders and behind closed doors. Now the prime minister is managing to get away with presenting himself as being at the heart of Europe, albeit only because in the midst of an economic meltdown that nobody predicted \u2013 least of all him \u2013 his period as chancellor in one of the EU's longest-serving administrations means that he is credited with greater knowledge of the mess than his less-experienced continental counterparts.</p> <p>The nature of Brown's history with the EU has been explored elsewhere (not least recently by my <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2008/10/brown-european-british-blair\">New Statesman colleague James Macintyre</a>). But the perceived new placing of Britain in Europe, however cynical, is of clear domestic advantage to the government when faced by an opposition whose leader has still not fulfilled a party election pledge to withdraw Tory MEPs from the integrationist European People's Party grouping. His hesitancy is understandable, given that the only other grouping feasibly open to his Euro MPs includes such voter-friendly charmers as Robert Kilroy-Silk and Jean-Marie Le Pen. But with <a href=\"http://news.scotsman.com/uk/Inside-Westminster--Tory-MEPs.4555203.jp\">European elections</a> in June, Cameron will have to face \u2013 or fudge \u2013 the issue sooner rather than later.</p> <p>The truth is that all this obfuscation on Europe has suited both major political parties. The less we hear about whether we should join the Euro or not (convenient as we may find it when holidaying cross-Manche) and about treaties that may or may not be constitutions, the better. EU questions cross and divide parties. Remember the Maastricht rebels? Or all that fuss about Brown's five tests? Playing a waiting game, hoping nothing much changes, putting off any firm decisions: that's much safer.</p> <p>Except it's not really safer at all. People are said to find the issue of Europe boring. But I find nothing boring about the fact that EU law now supersedes our own (and in matters of far greater import than the relative curvature of bananas). Nor do I find it boring that one day Britain and France will almost certainly cede their permanent seats on the UN Security Council to the EU; nor that the EU is already beginning to act as a united foreign policy bloc as a member of the quartet, with Russia, the US and UN, in relation to Israel.</p> <p>Despite Labour's historic Euroscepticism (advocating withdrawal from the then EEC in the 1983 general election manifesto, for instance), there is a sense that progressives, being internationalists, should automatically be in favour of ever closer union. However, there are different types of internationalism, and we need to decide whether the pooling of sovereignty involved in making any supranational body effective is something we want to commit to a protectionist, culturally inward-looking EU or to more genuinely international bodies: trying to revive the moribund Commonwealth, perhaps, or attempting to strengthen and reform a UN we should not and cannot give up on. </p> <p>As global power shifts and ebbs inexorably eastwards these are questions of great gravity \u2013 far more so, in fact, than the minutiae of domestic politics with which we preoccupy ourselves. Entertaining though such jousting may be, our long-term relationships, unilateral or EU-mediated, with Russia, India and China are more likely to concern future historians than the precise details of what George Osborne said to Peter Mandelson in a Greek taverna or the vexing subject of whether David Cameron sets a bad example by not always wearing his cycling helmet.</p> <p>Rather than let the EU steadily and stealthily accrete power \u2013 as Europhiles claim that it does not, although the transformation from a European Economic Community to a European Union proves otherwise \u2013 we need to decide what Britain's future will be in this body. We should not be lulled into thinking our European future benign merely because Brown seems temporarily to bestride the continent like some new Metternich.</p> <p>It should be a cause of outrage that Labour reneged on its promise to hold a referendum on the EU constitution that reemerged as the Lisbon Treaty. So too should news that Ireland is likely to be asked to hold a <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12429431\">second referendum</a> next October. The Irish rejected Lisbon in June, but this expression of a people's will was not deemed acceptable by the Eurocrats. What happens if the Irish vote no again \u2013 will they be asked to repeat the exercise until they finally come up with the correct answer? </p> <p>We claim to care deeply about the maintenance and establishment of democracy in other parts of the world. How curious that we appear to be so nonchalant about its practice at home, especially when the very nature of what our home is, who rules it, and what say we will have in its governance, is changing without us, the voters, ever being consulted.</p>",
  "<p>For years, debate about Iran has oscillated between two bad alternatives. Some are convinced that a nuclear Iran is the worst of all possible scenarios, worse even than the fall-out from a pre-emptive strike. But neither a nuclear-armed Iran nor air strikes against it are wise options, certainly not for this region. </p> <p>The repercussions of bombing Iran should be clear: closure of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Hormuz\">Strait of Hormuz</a>, rocketing oil prices, possible retaliation against Israel (regardless of the origin of the attack), and even greater turmoil in Iraq and Afghanistan. Indeed, the only certainty of any pre-emptive strike is irreparable and long-lasting damage to regional security and political and economic stability. </p> <p>Of course, the alternative is no safer. A nuclear-armed Iran would change the entire region's security environment, and, given the enmity between Israel and Iran, two such nuclear powers facing off against each other would pose a threat. </p> <p>The way out of this dilemma is to understand what Iran wants \u2013 and how to accommodate it without jeopardising anyone's security.</p> <p>President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said that Iran wants to develop uranium enrichment technology for industrial use. Everyone agrees that Iran has the right to do so. But the world is split over whether to believe that Iran is actually doing what it says.</p> <p>If, as some argue, Iran is being disingenuous, then once it achieves this first phase \u2013 uranium enrichment for industrial purposes \u2013 it can easily slide into weapons-grade enrichment, leaving the international community out in the cold, with no channels of communication, no observation teams in place, and no monitors ready to sound the whistle. </p> <p>That is why the world must not remain focused on the already-lost first phase. Iran has more than 3,000 centrifuges despite all the international sanctions and threats. Instead, the world must focus on the second phase, because it is weapons potential that is the looming danger, and it is here that internationally-mandated mechanisms for oversight and supervision exist. </p> <p>The Iranians have always said that they will continue to honour their commitments and open their doors to observation as members of the <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/nuke/control/npt/text/npt3.htm\">non-proliferation community</a>. But the international community must be more respectful of Iran's current industrial aims if it wants Iranian cooperation.</p> <p>The first step is to assuage Iran's feeling of being besieged. Fortunately, there are voices in America and elsewhere that advocate engaging Iran at the highest level. But to talk with Iran effectively one must understand Iranian values and thinking.</p> <p>Iranians have a sense of seniority, if not superiority, born of a rich and ancient culture that has survived into modern times. But they also have a historically ingrained sense of insecurity, owing to frequent conquest and domination, which is being aggravated today by the presence of American troops to their west in Iraq and to their east in Afghanistan. Their outlook nowadays is the product of these two worldviews \u2013 suspicious of others' motives and proud of themselves as smart, tough negotiators and not without their own resources.</p> <p>In my meetings with the current and past leaders of Syria and Iran, as well as in my meeting with Saddam Hussein, I heard them all say the same thing: the west is out to get them. Their explanation was that the west is uncomfortable with the motives and behaviour of ideological states _ Syria, Iran, and Iraq under Saddam were states with causes _ Islam, Arab unity, or anti-Zionism. </p> <p>For Iranians, as bearers of faith and national pride, responses that seem to others self-righteous and irrational are, in fact, necessary and acceptable. </p> <p>The case of Saddam's weapons of mass destruction is a historic example of a willingness to go to hell with your head held high. Saddam knew that he didn't have weapons of mass destruction, but he was unwilling to concede the right of inspectors to ask. </p> <p>As in North Korea, Iran's neighbours might provide the right mechanism to create a more transparent relationship between Iran and the world. In the so-called \"six-party talks\", North Korea's neighbours offered tangible incentives to Kim Jong-il's regime to abandon its nuclear programme. The most prominent of these was an end to North Korea's economic isolation.</p> <p>Iran, too, feels besieged, though it is not isolated: it depends heavily on trade, and not just as a seller of oil. Two-thirds of its population is under the age of 30, and unemployment is high; it needs to attract foreign investment for its oil and gas industry, and to finance road construction and other infrastructure projects.</p> <p>Comparisons with neighbouring Turkey are instructive. Before Iran's Islamic revolution, it led Turkey in foreign direct investment, income per head, and GDP growth. Now Turkey has moved ahead, and may even join the European Union.</p> <p>Other regional comparisons further reinforce that trend. The Qataris have outstripped the Iranians in exploiting the huge gas field they share. Tiny Dubai draws in far more foreign investment: Iranians go there for banking, trade, and fun. </p> <p>Iran's neighbours need to convince Iran's rulers that Iranians, too, can participate in the region's growth, and even become regional leaders. Only an open Iran, fully integrated into the regional economy and granted a role commensurate to its size and economic potential, will be able to moderate its siege mentality.</p> <p>Here, a vital step would be for the west to begin to envisage Iran as a potential alternative supplier of gas, by offering to link Iran to the proposed White Stream and Nabucco pipelines that are currently under development to bring Central Asian gas to Europe.</p> <p>The world's judgments about Iran's motives and actions should not be distorted by Iranian pride. We can only understand Iran's real intentions by engaging the Iranians \u2013 not cornering them.</p> <p><em>Vartan Oskanian, Armenia's minister of foreign affairs from 1998 until April 2008, is the founder of the Yerevan-based <a href=\"http://www.civilitasfoundation.org/\">Civilitas Foundation</a>. </em></p> <p><em>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</em></p>",
  "<p>Three years on from the riots that shook France, nothing has changed in French suburbs. During his presidential campaign, Nicolas Sarkozy promised a \"<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6496249.stm\">Marshall Plan</a>\" to reverse the social and economic problems in these troubled areas. However, as the media spotlight has moved away from the plight of the <em>banlieues</em>, Sarkozy and his government appear to be reneging on their promises. As a result, the threat of new violence is still very much a reality.</p> <p>The government's backtracking has not gone unnoticed among local politicians. On October 4, five mayors from some of the suburbs most heavily affected by the 2005 riots wrote an <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=1053411\">open letter</a> to the president in protest at the reform of the Fund for Urban Solidarity and Social Cohesion (DSU-CS). This fund provides much-needed financial support for the development of underprivileged urban areas. However, at the end of September and at the request of Sarkozy, the government unveiled new eligibility criteria for this fund. Consequently, many of the suburbs hit by violence in 2005 will see their funding significantly reduced. But the reform of the DSU-CS is only the tip of the iceberg.</p> <p>In the <em>\"Espoir banlieue\"</em> plan (the irony of the title, \"hope\", will not have gone unnoticed), Fad\u00e9la Amara, promised <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=1053702\">autonomy contracts</a> for the young unemployed. This equated to intensive training for youths in deprived areas, culminating in a state-financed job. However, at the beginning of October only about 100 of the 4,500 contracts promised for 2008, and the 45,000 promised over three years, had been signed.</p> <p>Sarkozy also promised to reduce the social divide that separates the suburbs from the rest of society by improving the mix of social classes. The opposite now appears to be the case as the government attempts to revise elements of a 2000 law obliging communes with more than 3,500 inhabitants to provide social housing to the tune of 20% of their housing plan. A <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2008/07/09/logement-social-le-gouvernement-veut-assouplir-les-criteres-de-la-loi-sru_1068224_823448.html?xtor=RSS-3224\">new law</a> on housing brought before the Senate contains a clause that would incorporate certain private property sales to \"families of modest means\" in the 20%.</p> <p>But above all, developments in relation to policing have exposed the emptiness of Sarkozy's promises to reunite French society. The tense relations between youth and police are a major element contributing to outbreaks of violence in the suburbs. Claims of police discrimination are widespread in these areas. However Sarkozy, a man who has used the theme of insecurity as a stepping-stone to political success, has made nothing more than a token gesture towards improving police-public relations in the suburbs. April saw the launch of the rightwing take on the community police, using a term and a concept <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=979016\">borrowed</a> from the left. The problem is that, essentially, these units will carry out the same functions as other officers. The difference appears to be in name only and nothing of note has been done to tackle the underlying problems. </p> <p>Since he began his presidency, Sarkozy has become known as \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/26/philistineetfier\">bling-bling Sarko</a>\". His <em>modus operandi</em> is based on spectacle and show. The problem is, once the fireworks are over, little seems to remain. The residents of these areas are still waiting to see the direct benefits of the billion-euro package promised by Sarkozy in February. The bottom line is that Sarkozy and his government have done nothing to resolve the fundamental problems facing the suburbs. So although the unprecedented riots of 2005 are slowly fading from memory, make no mistake, the potential for fresh violence of a similar scale still very much alive in the <em>banlieues</em>.</p>",
  "<p>The 43-year-old Bernard Hopkins ended the unbeaten reign of Kelly Pavlik in Atlantic City last night, claiming a unanimous points decision in the light heavyweight bout over the man 17 years his junior. Hopkins dominated his 26-year-old opponent from start to finish at the Boardwalk Hall, ending with scores of 119-106, 118-108 and 117-109 in favour of Hopkins.</p> <p>\"The Executioner\" had lost three of his previous five fights but last night rediscovered some of his best form and was quicker to the punch throughout the bout, landing better combinations and even leaving Pavlik unsteady on his feet on a few occasions. Pavlik (34-1), who is the current WBC and WBO middleweight champion, seemed to have trouble fighting for the first time in the light heavyweight division. He took the fight with Hopkins after struggling to find a quality opponent in his own weight class.</p> <p>\"The Ghost\" struggled to find his range and never had the Philadelphia native in trouble, looking much slower than his opponent despite his age advantage. Hopkins was the 4-1 outsider before the fight but he wobbled Pavlik in the second round with a left uppercut, which caused swelling under the right eye.</p> <p>Continuing to control the pace of the fight, Hopkins avoided Pavlik's jabs and slipped away from the big right hands while scoring with short left hooks. Hopkins again had Pavlik in trouble during the seventh round, scoring with a combination to the head and even showboating while the crowd rose to their feet.</p> <p>The round seemed to cause Pavlik to start doubting himself as he went back to his stool with blood streaming out of his nose. Hopkins finished well, delivering another big combination early in the 12th round, shaking Pavlik again to cap a dominant performance.</p> <p>The final punch statistics had Hopkins landing 32% of his punches (172 of 530), to Pavlik's 23% (108 of 463). Hopkins was even more dominant in the power punch category, connecting on 49% (148 of 304), compared with Pavlik's 26% (55 of 211). Pavlik was taken to a local hospital after the bout to get stitches.</p>",
  "<p>Instead of worshipping the invisible, and usually remote, hand of the market economy (which too often can be caught picking the pockets of the poor), you design an economic system in which resources flow and circulate effectively to serve the invisible heart of the core economy \u2013 made up of family, neighbourhood, community and civil society.</p> <p>One unintended consequence of the current global financial crisis is that it will reveal what some have known for a long time, namely that a new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics\">economics</a> is already emerging. The tragedy is that the crisis-ridden financial system has long since failed to do the basic job required \u2013 underpin the productive economy and the fundamental operating systems upon which we all depend. These have been variously neglected, taken for granted or cannibalised by finance. They include the core economy of family, neighbourhood, community and society, and the natural economy of the biosphere, our oceans forests and fields. <br> That is why, as we aim for recovery, we should not be trying to get back to how things were before. Before was built on an illusion of limitless credit and unlimited natural resources. It was unsustainable for many reasons. Injecting liquidity into the system and looking for signs of recovery in the return of consumer binge-spending on the high street will simply lay the foundations for an even bigger crash in the future. Consumerism is highly addictive, giving a brief high that quickly wears off and is damaging to both the individual and the world around them. For a society like Britain, there is a large and growing literature that shows, fairly conclusively, we have been looking in the wrong place to find greater life satisfaction and measure the economy's success. With most people having most of their basic material needs met, organising society to achieve progress through indiscriminately rising consumption not only doesn't work \u2013 the fall-out from the long hours, throwaway, materialistic, individualistic, status-obsessed culture that accompanies it, is counter-productive, undermining and ultimately destructive.  For a vision of what an alternative might look like, the current edition of <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/home.ns\">New Scientist</a> magazine contains enough economic heresy (but scientific common sense) to choke every finance minister in the northern hemisphere and the whole staff of the International Monetary Fund. Best is the vision for what the country and economy could like in 2020. In it, we have moved from an economy of over-consumption, through-put and waste, and the anachronism of overwork and unemployment, to one which the ecological economist <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicy.umd.edu/facstaff/faculty/Daly.html\">Herman Daly</a> describes as, \"a subtle and complex economics of maintenance, qualitative improvements, sharing, frugality, and adaptation to natural limits. It is an economics of better, not bigger.\"</p> <p>The good thing about such an economy is that it is rich in employment and the thick weave of local, micro-economic relationships that help to create resilient economies and bind communities together. Instead of worshipping the invisible, and usually remote, hand of the market economy (which too often can be caught picking the pockets of the poor), you design an economic system in which resources flow and circulate effectively to serve the invisible heart of the core economy \u2013 made up of family, neighbourhood, community and civil society.</p> <p>It is already happening in place but could quickly move to a much bigger scale. Google tell their staff to spend 10% of their time not doing their job. They're free to get involved with the local community. The company has found that as a result it has made staff more innovative. A lot of research shows that such community involvement also has a very positive payback in terms of life satisfaction. A 10% rule could be introduced across the economy with time credited to the local community. But we could go further. In Britain, the idea of a shorter working week was sullied by the chaos of the 1970s. But again, if people who over-work, worked less, employment could be more equally distributed. Coupled with other innovations to ensure a basic income guaranteeing basic needs, shorter working weeks help turn us from being time-poor, to time-affluent. With more time for family, community and creative learning it makes for happier people and better neighbourhoods.</p> <p>A duty of reciprocity in public services could also help nurture the core economy. People who offer time, as simple as making visits to the elderly and infirm, could earn time credits to use public services like leisure centres at off peak times. </p> <p>Local authorities could use Section 106 (the planning gain law) in negotiations with businesses, to introduce a \"time commitment\" ensuring that they bring some useful service to the local community \u2013 even if only making rooms available for use. <a href=\"http://www.timebanks.co.uk/what_is_timebanking.asp\">Time banking</a> is already working successfully in some health centres. In Wales a time banking system was introduced in which older women provided skills to local schools and were given time credits in return. They cashed them in for bingo sessions during the day and theatre performances in the evening. Their fear of going out at night was solved because the local rugby club was part of the scheme too, and took time credits to accompany them. Then, the women started to lose their fear of going out, and felt secure enough to go alone. There was an upward spiral of personal and communal well-being. Note that these are all low-carbon, relationship building activities. </p> <p>Life satisfaction scores tend to be much higher among people with a more communally oriented set of values than those who are materialistic and individualistic. They are also less driven to consume for its own sake. Kick the addiction. Get time-rich. Be happy.</p>",
  "<p>The states of Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico are key to what has been called Barack Obama's Western strategy. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._presidential_election,_2004\">All three states helped send George W Bush</a> to a second term, but they are all leaning, even if slightly, to Obama. New Mexico shows why these states have been challenging for Democrats and also why Barack Obama might win here.</p> <p>We're now in Colorado. We've been to Nevada and New Mexico, and here is The Nation's Ari Melber talking about Obama's western strategy:</p> <p><strong>Western Democrats, a different breed</strong></p> <p>Politics in these western states is very different than on the coasts. Take Democratic Bill Richardson for example. He touts his support for <a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/Bill_Richardson_Gun_Control.htm\">gun rights and won the endorsement of the National Rifle Association</a>. He has a permit to carry a concealed weapon, said Heath Haussamen who covers politics for the New Mexico Independent.</p> <p>John McCain's message of \"drill, baby, drill\" also plays well in this oil and natural gas producing state, Heath said. The <a href=\"http://www.ewg.org/oil_and_gas/leaseholder.php?cust_id=-199080\">Yates Petroleum Company headquartered here is the largest holder</a> of oil and gas drilling leases on federal land in the West, and it's been an important industry for the state.</p> <p>This is a traditionally Democatic state, but the majority of Democrats are conservative Hispanic Democrats, Heath said, and they supported President Bush on the war longer than many other groups.</p> <p>\"They are pro-drilling, pro-life, big 2nd amendment supporters, but they also believe in welfare and unions. New Mexico voters have tended to send moderate Republicans to Washington, but the state has been trending leftward,\" Heath said.</p> <p><strong>Economic concerns</strong></p> <p>The state is one of the least affected by the housing crisis, and 25% of jobs in the state are for either the state or federal government, said <a href=\"http://joemonahansnewmexico.blogspot.com/\">New Mexico political blogger Joe Monahan</a>. Despite that, as with the rest of the country, the economy is the biggest issue.</p> <p>When I interviewed Joe, he was working on a story about <a href=\"http://joemonahansnewmexico.blogspot.com/2008_10_01_joemonahansnewmexico_archive.html#3508873368368298623#3508873368368298623\">a possible budget crunch in the state</a>, and the state's most populous <a href=\"http://kob.com/article/stories/S623232.shtml?cat=519\">county had just announced a $10m budget shortfall</a>.</p> <p>Heath lives in Las Cruces in the south of the state, and there are $200m in state or federal construction projects in the city alone. \"People are concerned that the government will have to cut back on spending to pay for financial bailout.\"</p> <p>A month ago, New Mexico was a toss-up state, but now, \"the consensus is that Obama has the edge,\" Heath said. RealClearPolitics shows <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/nm/new_mexico_mccain_vs_obama-448.html\">Obama with an average 8.4% lead</a> based on polls in the state.</p> <p>Two things in the last four years that have changed to help Barack Obama, Joe said. \"National security issue is not quite as dominant as an issue, and economic security is.\"</p> <p><strong>Obama's organisation</strong></p> <p>One thing that we're seeing in the states we're driving through is the presence of the Obama campaign and the enthusiasm of his supporters. In New Mexico, Obama has 40 field offices to McCain's 10. That number of field offices is unheard of, Heath said.</p> <p>Barack Obama has also been reaching out to Native American voters, which make up 10% of the state. They have volunteers and paid staff focused on getting out the vote in the native nations. They have held rallies focused on Native voters. \"The Obama campaign isn't taking anything for granted,\" said Trip Jennings, the news editor for the New Mexico Independent.</p> <p>Joe says that it's important not to over-emphasise the advantage in field offices and ground organisation by Democrats because theri voters tend to be less reliable. They have to work harder to get them to the polls. John McCain has run a more traditional campaign relying on phone banks and direct mail. Republicans appeal to a \"more likely voter\" so don't have to put as much effort to get voters out, he said.</p> <p>Also in Obama's favour is that Governor Bill Richardson has also been a strong ally since he decided to endorse him over Hillary Clinton, even though he had served <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Richardson#U.S._Ambassador_to_the_United_Nations\">in Bill Clinton's administration</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/04/02/BAVNVU2PJ.DTL\">setting off the former president's famous anger</a>.</p> <p>Governor Richardson has been a major fundraiser for Obama, bringing in $2m for the presidential campaign at a recent event, and he's helped Obama navigate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/oct/18/uselections2008-race-newmexico\">the unique politics of the state</a>.</p> <p><strong>The final stretch</strong></p> <p>Two weeks before the election, Joe says that Obama doesn't have the kind of lead that assures victory. \"There are a lot of voters who can be influenced by whatever is the last thing they see. While this election looks likes its trending Democrat and Obama, I don't think the margin is enough to rule out some kind of major development that could lead to an upset.\"</p> <p>The campaigns are fighting hard for the state's votes. <a href=\"http://newmexicoindependent.com/5649/biden-rallies-southern-nm-voters-for-obama\">Joe Biden campaigned in southern New Mexico</a> this week, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/oct/18/uselections2008-newmexico\">Sarah Palin is coming to Roswell</a>.</p> <p>A number of people I've spoke to along the way have said that whoever wins the presidential election will actually lose because the problems facing the country are so great, but Joe disagrees.</p> <p>He said: \"The next president is going to have a terrible job, but out of a terrible situation can come often come greatness. You would not have had an FDR without the Depresion. You would not have had a Lincoln with the Civil War. This is really going to test whoever wins the White House.\"</p>",
  "<p>So Gordon Brown is now calling for a 2008 rerun of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/15/economy-gordonbrown1\">1944 Bretton Woods</a> meeting. Is this political posturing or is there a case for a global summit on the financial system? The events of the last year, and especially those of the last few weeks, have reminded us that the financial system can cause widespread damage.</p> <p>Compared to 1944, this capability has been enhanced by globalisation, the abolition of exchange controls almost everywhere and advances in financial engineering. If a framework can be designed which mitigates this risk, then we should attempt to create one. The IMF may have been brilliantly designed in 1944, but its role, funding and political clout have, if anything, diminished in recent times, and so it is likely that a new body with a new charter is what is needed. What are the roles that such a body needs to fill?</p> <p>\u0095 Accident prevention: Financial institutions are central to economic stability in our world. Because of the infectious nature of problems emerging in any one part of the system, it seems important that any global body should have as a central task the maintenance of systemic stability.</p> <p>The central idea here is to protect the system from irrational exuberance. Regulation plays a key role and it would seem logical that the new agency should take over what has hitherto been called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_Accords\">Basle process</a> of bank regulation, along with corresponding initiatives in the insurance sector. This is not to suggest that there should be a global regulator, but simply that the design and implementation of regulation should be coordinated. The new body would set minimum standards and would prescribe a uniform approach to be implemented in all member states with a view to limiting \"regulatory arbitrage\" \u2013 the exploitation of differences in regulatory treatment in different jurisdictions and in different types of entity. Another area where a new agency could promote stability is in striking a balance between those derivative products which are traded and cleared, and those which are dealt with \"over the counter\" on a bilateral basis. The requirement to post margin on cleared transactions, and the discipline of standardised contracts and central credit control which is inherent in cleared markets, has great merit.</p> <p>\u0095 Early warning system: The new body would be an obvious venue for policy coordination in times of stress but, perhaps more importantly, it ought to act as an early warning system. Very recent experience suggests that this is possibly the most important role of all for a couple of reasons. Firstly, had such a body been in place, it would have been in a position to warn central banks and regulators alike about the challenge that financial institutions would have in recycling US budgetary and payments deficits on the one hand, and burgeoning Asian savings on the other. Similarly, such an agency would have been able publicly to comment on the way in which banking systems in certain countries had outgrown the ability of those countries' central banks to act as lenders of last resort. The obvious case in point is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/05/iceland.creditcrunch\">Iceland</a>.</p> <p>\u0095 Lender of last resort: This was the IMF's role but it now neither has the resources nor the mandate to act in this way. Setting up a lender of last resort in 2008 would require a concerted effort from the leading central banks \u2013 the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan and so on \u2013 and could presumably be dealt with through a combination of paid-in capital and stand-by lines.</p> <p>These are just the bones of an outline of an agency that would likely be a \"big boys club\", rather than a financial United Nations. In order to be effective, it would need the wholehearted support of politicians, central banks and regulators. If it got that, the effort would be worthwhile. </p> <p><em>This article was written with the advice and assistance of Stephen Kingsley, director of financial services at <a href=\"http://www.lecg.com/\">LECG</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Road Trip, Day 7. This morning we set off early for a long drive north from Albuquerque to Colorado Springs, where we hope to get a whiff of the famed evangelical Christian fervor the city is famous for, and see Sarah Palin in person at a rally on Monday morning. </p> <p>One hour out, we decided to stop off at a political rally in Santa Fe, where state politicians were supposed to lead locals in an early voting drive to the polls. When we got there the place looked dead, and we decided it was a bust. But one of the team had to find a toilet, and disappeared for the longest time into a building. Finally reappearing, he motioned to us to follow him around the corner. And there were the voters: not 10 or 20, but a good 75, waiting in the sun for as long as 2 hours, with more people joining the line all the time. </p> <p>So here in Santa Fe was first proof of what both Republicans and Democrats fear, though for entirely different reasons: a huge turnout that is certain to favor Obama, but would also swamp the polls and overtax the state's voting system. Brian Egolf, who is running for state representative from Santa Fe, told me he believed the turnout would be an unheard of 85 percent. </p> <p>Emerging from the voting booth in his wheelchair, Joe Parker, a state employee, told me that he had been turned away from voting at the primary and wasn't going to have that happen again. \"I want to be sure there are no problems,\" he said with a tight smile, explaining that ballots in New Mexico had a way of getting \"lost.\" By voting early with a paper ballot, he hoped to ensure that his vote would be actually be counted. Others expressed the same sentiments, fearing for the worst in a state with a wretched recent record of failure at the ballot box.</p> <p>Our researcher Jean Casella, who is tracking voter suppression from state to state as we cross the country, sent me the following rundown of the massive problems that plagued the 2004 election here in New Mexico: </p> <p>The results showed a sky-high rate of \"undervotes\"\u2014ballots that have been cast but do not include a vote in a particular contest. According to the group <a href=\"http://votetrustusa.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=208&amp;Itemid=113\">VoteTrustUSA</a>,<br>New Mexico led the nation in the undervotes with an astonishing one out of every 36 ballots missing a vote for president. The total undervotes came to over 21,000\u2014more than five times the margin of victory in that election, which George W. Bush won by fewer than 4,000 votes. </p> <p>Because New Mexico's five electoral votes would not have changed the outcome of the 2004 race, this massive loss of votes received relatively little attention. But it drove home the risks of electronic voting. An analysis by VotersUnite.org revealed that \"more than 80% of New Mexico's undervotes were recorded (or, more accurately, not recorded)\" on Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) voting machines,\" with no verifiable paper trails. </p> <p>Amid protests and lawsuits, Governor Bill Richardson in 2006 signed a state law banning the machines and requiring paper ballots. He warned other states against the technology, saying, \"One person, one vote is in jeopardy.\" That year's election saw a <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=4193\">huge drop </a>in the undervote rate. </p> <p>With mandated paper ballots, New Mexico is not likely to relive the travesty of 2004. But now there are worries about the <a href=\"http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2007/dec/19/new-mexico-has-no-plans-toss-voting-machines/\">machines that count the paper ballots</a>, as well as about shortages of ballots and of polling places. Once burned, New Mexicans have good reason to be worried about their votes being counted.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Monday October 20 2008. Above we said that New Mexico has four electoral votes, it has five. This has been changed.</p>"
