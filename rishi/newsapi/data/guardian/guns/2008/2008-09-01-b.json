For a supposedly ruthless profession their blood does run pretty milky in the movies. John Cusack's Martin Blank would rather go gooey over Minnie Driver than cause carnage in Grosse Point. Jason Bourne is as interested in finding himself as your average Goan hippy and even Agent blooming 47, out of a film actually called Hitman, is distracted from his true calling by the love of a good Russian.</p> <p>So the question has to be asked as to whether \"Joe\", as played by Nicolas Cage in the remake of the Pang Brothers' 1999 success Bangkok Dangerous, is about to redress the balance. Will he put finally put a touch of dehumanised sadist back into the killer for hire?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337175540\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/09/01/bangkok4.jpg\" alt=\"Bangkok Dangerous\" width=\"220\" height=\"147\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some kind of Nighthawk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>0.10:</strong> The initial signs are good. Joe, just Joe thank you very much, is sat alone in a diner late on, like some kind of Nighthawk. He is gazing into the distance, contemplating the futility of human existence. We presume.</p> <p>\"My job takes me to a lot of places,\" Joe intones. \"The work is steady, the money's good, but it's not for everyone.\"</p> <p>Why's that then? Oh. Is it because you sometimes have to leave what you're doing and, from the top of a tall building, shoot a man dead in the head? That's it, isn't it.</p> <p><strong>0.19:</strong> \"My name is Joe ... This is what I do.\"</p> <p>Yes, that seems clear now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337175541\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/09/01/bangkok5.jpg\" alt=\"Bangkok Dangerous\" width=\"140\" height=\"210\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">We're in the Far East!</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>0.21:</strong> A flash of studio ident and the roar of a jumbo jet signify a jump in the storyline. Joe, it seems, is flying abroad \u2013 probably on a job of killing \u2013 but where precisely is he going?</p> <p>\"Purposs of your bizit to Bangkok, Mr Lincent?\"</p> <p>\"Holiday.\"</p> <p>Ah, thanks, helpful customs official! Your inability to say the letter V has clued us right up. We're in the Far East!</p> <p><strong>0.26:</strong>Now we are treated to a montage. This is to confirm, if there had been any doubt, that this film is called Bangkok Dangerous for a reason. First we see a shot of an alluring, mysterious Asian woman (or young man - we're not prejudicial here); then Joe awkwardly attempting tai chi; and, finally, some kick-boxing. We are in Thailand.</p> <p><strong>0.34:</strong> After a motorbike-based murder that proves once and for all that Joe was not telling the whole truth to the customs official, we are once again in the company of a Thai national with stereotypically poor English. He is setting Joe up with his next target, whom he describes thusly: \"This guy, he fight bad guys, and helps the poor.\"</p> <p>Cue picture of dignitary waving to crowd from seat of convertible like a chubby, Asian JFK.</p> <p>All the while, Joe's eyes are widening. He's realising, with wearisome predictability, that he's not a cold-blooded killing machine. No, he's a man, with a conscience. Damn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337175542\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/09/01/bangkok1.jpg\" alt=\"Bangkok Dangerous\" width=\"220\" height=\"147\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The highly predictable bit</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>0.40:</strong> What follows now is typical; Joe tells his paymasters he's not happy - \"Political assassination wasn't part of the contract\" \u2013 and lots of shooting, blowing up and nervous looks over the shoulder ensue.

It's improvisation like that which has taken Joe to the top of his profession.</p> <p><strong>0.55:</strong> The explosions continue as Joe reveals his four rules for a successful career in assassination:</p> <p>1. Don't ask questions;<br>2. There is no right and wrong;<br>3. Don't take an interest in people outside of work (oops!);<br>4. Know when to get out and walk away rich.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337175543\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/09/01/bangkok3.jpg\" alt=\"Bangkok Dangerous\" width=\"220\" height=\"147\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oops</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The word \"oops\" is appended to rule number 3 because Joe's voiceover is spliced with an image of him sitting alone with a beautiful young woman and looking a little soppy. Unless Joe is trying to lure her into a false sense of security before poisoning her with rare mushrooms, it appears rule 3 has been compromised.</p> <p><strong>1.05:</strong> \"Nothing is deadlier than a hit man who hits back\", reads the tagline, slightly less than convincingly. What about a hitman who isn't compromised by conscience in the first place? Surely they're more dangerous? Or a 50 foot-high lizard that breathes fire?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337175544\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/09/01/bangkok6.jpg\" alt=\"Bangkok Dangerous\" width=\"220\" height=\"119\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Snazzy action sequences</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>1.12:</strong> No answers are proffered, but we do get some snazzy, slow-mo, stylised action sequences, in order to remind us that this is an Asian action movie, remade by the Pang brothers themselves. One of the brothers calls himself Oxide Pang Chun. His mother must be proud.</p> <p><strong>1.25:</strong> \"Well what is your work?\" asks an old lady, who is actually quite good with her Rs.</p> <p>\"Banking\" replies Joe, with an earnest smile. That's the second time in a minute he's done the ironic What's My Line routine. If you extrapolate that to 90 minutes, we'll have 180 inaccurate job descriptions.</p> <p>\"And why are you here at this top secret mafia hideout?\"</p> <p>\"I'm selling buildings insurance\"</p> <p><strong>1.35:</strong> The trailer comes to an end in a fury of late-90s electronica (a bit like Chemical Brothers circa Dig Your Own Hole, music fans) and an original, if bizarre, piece of CGI wizardry: namely a shot that pursues a bullet all the way from a rifle into the skull of our AJFK.</p> <p>It moves fast and the rendering of the scene is convincing. The only thing that's odd is the trajectory of the bullet, which seems to wobble up and down like a new ride at Alton Towers (The Assassin's Bullet). In conclusion, you may not learn much new about the psychology of the hitman, but Bangkok Dangerous promises to be a ballistic bonanza.</p>",

  "<p>It was, we read \"a war Russia had not started, had not provoked and had not sought\". There was \"no other choice but to go to the assistance of those who were being killed\". And regretful as they were, people knew it was right, according to the fascinating supplement, Russia, Beyond the Headlines. \"I am sorry to say this but I think a lot of western people understand nothing about the situation,\" said one contributor. \"Russia is completely right. Only the blind don't see,\" observed another. It is fair enough, of course, that the Russian authorities would want to get their point of view across. And it is fair that Rossiyskaya Gazeta, the publication which produced the supplement and is seen as close to the Kremlin, should help to do it. But one does wonder what the readers of Saturday's Daily Telegraph thought of it all when they found the eight-page, Kremlin-friendly pullout tucked within that morning's paper. Some, no doubt, thought it was all a bit rum, especially as the British government has been so critical of the Russian adventure, but perhaps there were others who gained fresh perspective. The Russians tell us they pay the Telegraph \u00a340,000 each month to distribute Beyond the Headlines. At a time like this, that's money well spent.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>So many interesting things emerged from the National Union of Students' training seminar in York, as we noted last week. One student rep's suggestion that more minorities would also mean more gun and knife crime on campus caught the imagination. Claims that another brandished a Bring Back Slavery sign provided another talking point. An NUS inquiry is under way, but we are told that the students accused, one from the Midlands and the other from London, have yet to fully cooperate. One has the help of a barrister. Some say they might open up a bit now that the matter is being formally investigated by North Yorkshire police. But don't hold your breath.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>We see that Boris Johnson's performance at the Olympic handover continues to dog his mayoralty. There he was, hands in pockets, jacket unbuttoned. Now there is a kerfuffle about his speech. \"Ping pong was invented on the dining tables of England in the 19th century and it was called whiff-whaff,\" he said as the baton was passed. \"There you have the essential difference between us and the rest of the world. The French might look at a dining table and see an opportunity to eat. We looked at it and saw an opportunity to play whiff-whaff.\" But that was historically inaccurate, according to Joe Jaques, whose great-grandfather John replaced the cork ball of the parlour game gossima with a lighter plastic one, and patented the game as ping pong. Whiff-whaff was but a \"cheap imitation\" produced a year later, he claims. \"I watched Mr Johnson's speech and I was appalled,\" an angry Mr Jaques told kentnews.co.uk. \"It's criminal really.\" But it's all the same to Boris. \"I stand by my assertion that whiff-whaff and ping pong are one and the same thing, with the whiffs predating the pongs,\" he says. As ever, the master of detail.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>BBC4's celebration of cop shows past prompts recollections from the team behind the 70s classic The Sweeney. And we are fortunate, for one provides an insight into the legendary Jack Slipper, who famously chased Ronnie Biggs to the beaches of Brazil, even after retirement. Beloved to this day as Slipper of the Yard, he led the Flying Squad. Ian Kennedy Martin, the show's creator, remembers how Slipper, who died in 2005, was told by his bosses to find out what the programme-makers were up to. \"It's quite obvious to me that you've got inside information about how we do things here and I want you to tell me who is talking to you,\" Slipper said. \"I'm not going to reveal my sources,\" the writer replied. \"Well, that's the end of that then; the meeting's over,\" said Slipper. He was tenacious; thorough. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>And finally, a question currently vexing those who set standards at the BBC. Was it a good idea for BBC Radio Suffolk to brand its anti-litter campaign Don't Be A Tosser? Above our pay grade. Let them sort it out.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:diary@theguardian.com\">diary@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown will today launch the first phase of his autumn economic fightback when he unveils a package of measures to revive the ailing housing market targeted at first time buyers and vulnerable families.</p> <p>As the government continued to suffer from the fallout of Alistair Darling's Guardian interview - with the pound falling to a record low against the euro - Brown will try to wrench back control of the political agenda by announcing a three-point plan including a \u00a31bn package to build and acquire more social housing.</p> <p>Downing Street hopes the plan, to be unveiled at No 10, will focus attention on \"real help\" for struggling families after a bruising weekend during which the chancellor warned Britain faced \"arguably the worst\" economic conditions in 60 years.</p> <p>Launching his housing plan with the communities secretary, Hazel Blears, Brown will announce a \u00a31bn three-point plan which will involve:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A new mortgage rescue scheme to help the most vulnerable families at risk from repossession.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A new shared equity scheme aimed at helping first-time buyers, called Home Buy Direct, where government and developers would offer a loan of up to 30%.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Bringing hundreds of millions of pounds forward to allow social landlords and councils to build more affordable homes.</p> <p>The housing announcements are the first of a series to be made this week as part of the government's so-called economic relaunch in what has become a defining month for the prime minister. On Thursday he will use what is being billed as a wide-ranging speech to the Scottish CBI to set out further policies to help \"hard-working families\". September will culminate in a critical speech to Labour's party conference in Manchester.</p> <p>But Brown's fightback has been overshadowed by Darling's warning about the state of the economy. Some Brown supporters indicated yesterday the chancellor could be vulnerable in a forthcoming reshuffle. But the Brown circle moved last night to quash such rumours when Ed Balls, the schools secretary, told ITV News: \"I have no reason to believe there's any prospect in any change of chancellor.\" </p> <p>Darling's comments hit sterling, pushing it to a record low against the euro and to its weakest level against the dollar for more than two years. </p> <p>At one point the pound fell below $1.80 and to 81.40 pence to the euro. Just a month ago the pound would buy $2 and a euro could be bought for 78 pence. Sterling has fallen almost 5% in the past month against a basket of major currencies, and nearly 9% against the dollar.</p> <p>The government's announcement today on housing comes the day after the Royal Institute for Chartered Surveyors (Rics) reported house sales had reached a 30-year low and figures from the Bank of England put new mortgage approvals for July down 71% on last year.</p> <p>The government's housing scheme will give a mortgage rescue package to families assessed by a \"money adviser\" to no longer be able to afford their mortgage repayments. </p> <p>The package may be of three types - \"sale and rent back\" which would see a registered social landlord such as a housing association clearing the debt completely, allowing the homeowner to become a tenant at a level they can afford; shared ownership which would see the landlord buying a share (enabling the purchaser to pay off some of their mortgage) and converting the property to shared ownership; and finally shared equity in which a landlord provides a loan for equity, allowing the householder's mortgage repayments to be reduced.</p> <p>James Rowlands, policy adviser at Rics said that while shared ownership and shared equity schemes were not new, this was the first time the government had allowed the schemes to be offered to those in danger of having their home repossessed.</p>",
  "<p>There's a belief that languages either come naturally to a person, or they don't. But to the late Michel Thomas, the \"world's greatest language master\", there was no such thing as a bad student, only a bad teacher.</p> <p>It's a view that grates with prevailing educational opinion. These days, children's inability to learn is often blamed on a variety of learning disabilities. If teachers are brought into the equation, it is usually by ministers either claiming the workforce is the best trained it has ever been, or declaring that inadequate teachers must be fired.</p> <p>Thomas believed his method, applied faithfully, would work with anyone. Students saw him as a magician. Now, in his new book The Language Revolution, the educational psychologist Jonathan Solity reveals how Thomas set about teaching foreign languages and the psychological principles behind his methods. He thinks they could revolutionise teaching, and help schools meet targets.</p> <p>Thomas's prowess as a language teacher stemmed from his experiences during the second world war. Born Moniek Kroskof in Poland to Jewish parents in 1914, Thomas was driven by anti-Semitic persecution to France, where he joined the French resistance and spent two years in concentration camps during the war. Having survived interrogation and torture by the Gestapo, he went on to work for the US intelligence services after the war ended, helping to liberate Dachau and convict Nazi criminals by securing secret German documents.</p> <p>Learning how to block out pain while being tortured unveiled the potential of the human mind to Thomas and the experience proved instrumental in his life's work. He used it to build his new method of teaching languages and set up an institute in Beverly Hills. He taught the rich and famous - Woody Allen, Grace Kelly and Francois Truffaut among them - for money, and gave public classes for free.</p> <p>Languages were what he chose to teach, but he had more ambitious aims. \"I wanted to demonstrate that anybody can learn. I didn't devise my system to teach languages quickly - I did it to change the world.\" Teaching a language would demonstrate the power of his methods because it was the most \"alien\" thing for a person to learn, he argued.</p> <p>Thomas's background meant he struggled to trust anyone throughout his life. He kept his teaching technique secret right up until a decade ago when, in his 80s, he was persuaded by Hodder Education to record it for posterity.</p> <p>\"The language tapes he used in his school were jealously guarded, and kept locked up in his office, as he thought people would steal and corrupt his method,\" explains Sue Hart, a publisher at Hodder. \"His war experiences made him mistrustful of people a lot of the time. Building up his trust was the most difficult thing. We put in a lot of time.\"</p> <p>The British public first became aware of Thomas through a BBC documentary, The Language Master, in 1997 (<a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ3xvL22hLE\">http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ3xvL22hLE</a>). </p> <p>He astounded staff at a school in north London by teaching a group of teenagers deemed incapable of learning languages. In one week, they learned the amount of French it normally takes five years to acquire. Three years of careful negotiations later, Hart persuaded Thomas to make recordings with students found through an appeal in Education Guardian. The result was the Michel Thomas Method courses, initially in French, German, Italian and Spanish.</p> <p>\"He never committed anything to paper. He taught without any notes at all. It was an act of faith recording him,\" Hart says. It paid off. Over a million copies of the language courses have sold so far. And, since Thomas's death in 2005, Hodder has published seven more based on his method, with the help of Rose Lee Hayden, a trusted teacher from his language school.</p> <p>The tapes are the closest anyone can now get to being taught by Thomas. It is these that Solity has analysed to reveal how Thomas's method works. \"Michel said all learning was down to the quality of the teaching, and the teacher rather than the student,\" he explains. </p> <p>\"He challenged a lot of myths and was absolutely confident his methodology worked not because he was so charismatic - which everyone said he was - but because of the sound psychological principles that underpinned what he was doing. It's likely those principles would extend way beyond teaching foreign languages. This has huge implications for teaching anybody anything.\"</p> <h2>Proper research</h2> <p>Why, if the method was so foolproof, did Thomas not teach teachers how to teach? He was concerned they would mess about with the formula, Solity says, and his early experiences with education researchers scarred him. \"When he was in the States, he did try to negotiate with academics to do some research into his methods. But they weren't willing to do it the way he wanted. He wanted proper scientific research, not the kind where you just go round and ask people what they think works.</p> <p>\"The kind of research that would show why his methods are successful isn't the kind of research educational academics do. They don't compare one method with another, they tend to look at schools that are seen to be effective, and try to pinpoint what it is they have done.</p> <p>\"Even now, in this country, if you think about the literacy and numeracy strategies and all the other initiatives that have been proposed, they've never been piloted in a way that you can say 'this method is more effective than any other'. It's just a kind of hotchpotch of people putting together what they think is a good idea.\"</p> <p>This also explains why the sector hasn't embraced Thomas's methods, according to Solity. \"People tend to attribute how we learn to some kind of natural ability, and learning difficulties are given as an explanation as to why children can't learn, which is the antithesis of what Michel believed,\" he says.</p> <p>Ministers promote teaching that supports the idea that some children have a problem that prevents them from learning, Solity argues. He is convinced Thomas's methods would work in any subject, and improve how all pupils learn. \"People think they are either naturals at languages or not, but that's just not the case. If you didn't learn in the past, it's just as likely to have been the fault of a poor teacher. </p> <p>\"Can you imagine a teacher saying: 'Whether or not you learn is down to me. If you don't learn, I'll go home and revise what I'm doing and try to teach you differently.' It's easier to say that children have a learning difficulty,\" Solity says.</p> <p>So what psychological principles underpin Thomas's method? Solity says: \"Studying in little bits every day is really very powerful, and so is interleaved learning, where you mix the old and the new. It's the idea of teaching a small, core amount of information that's really useful and generalisable. The problem comes when you think teaching more is better - you introduce confusion and that undermines people's capacity to learn.\"</p> <p>With Thomas's teaching, students learn comparatively little vocabulary, but do understand how a language is structured. \"Michel teaches phrases you wouldn't necessarily use conversationally, but you learn how to put any sentence together. His approach was to learn step by step, very much as we learn English.\"</p> <p>Children using the Thomas method are taken to a point where they can retain what they've learned, apply it, and generalise it to other examples. At school, there rarely seems to be time to wait for learning to be embedded in all pupils before moving on. \"Thomas's students learned without being aware they were doing so, because of the way he structured knowledge,\" Solity explains. \"He wasn't a Svengali-like figure who seduced them into doing things they wouldn't normally be able to do. He just incorporated these psychological principles.\"</p> <h2>Transplant sceptic</h2> <p>Chris Husbands, professor of education at the Institute of Education, agrees with the importance of structuring learning. But he's sceptical about transplanting one particular teaching method into all schools. \"There's a great desire to find out what works in teaching, but one of the problems with schools and teaching is that almost anything works somewhere. There's a long history of education innovations, which have the power to transform.</p> <p>\"What you typically find is that at the pilot stage, when you have well-trained and enthusiastic pioneers, you get very good results. But when you take it mainstream, you get a wash-out of the effect. Replicating a formula across the whole education system is difficult to sustain, because of the multiple competing goals of education, and the complexity of students and classrooms. If 50 teachers were trained in the Michel Thomas method, you would see a return, but the point at which you get up to 400,000 teachers, you would see a wash-out effect.\"</p> <p>Critics suggest that the Thomas's method worked purely because of his personality. Hart hopes the book will prove them wrong. \"When Michel taught, he was in his element. It was fascinating to watch. But he used to get very angry when people said it purely because he was so charismatic. We've proved that it was the method that worked.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> To order Michel Thomas Method products at special prices, visit <a href=\"http://www.pressoffers.co.uk/michelthomas\">www.pressoffers.co.uk/michelthomas</a> or call 0870 7552122 and quote offer code HOD222</p>",
  "<p>An advice booklet telling parents how to spot whether their children are involved in a gang and detailing the practical steps they can take is to be published today by the home secretary, Jacqui Smith.</p> <p>It coincides with the launch of a victim support charity, the New Year Shooting Memorial Trust, set up by Beverley Thomas and Marcia Shakespeare, whose teenage daughters were killed in a drive-by shooting in Birmingham in 2003.</p> <p>An initial print run of 30,000 copies of the booklet, Gangs: You and Your Child, are to be distributed to inner-city parents in London, Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham. The initiative comes as the new chief constable of Greater Manchester, Peter Fahy, said he was prepared to use \"high-risk tactics\" including bringing rival gang members together for face-to-face mediation talks to tackle gun crime. </p> <p>The relentless pace of gun and knife murders shows no signs of slacking, with two teenage boys, Luke Howard and Shaquille Smith, stabbed to death in Liverpool and Hackney over the weekend. A week before, a young man, Dimitri Foskin, aged 24, was shot dead in Birmingham in the latest in a series of gang-related incidents. </p> <p>The Home Office booklet for parents contains some apparently obvious signs of gang membership such as finding a weapon hidden among a child's possessions, unexplained physical injuries and withdrawal from family or school life.</p> <p>More controversial warning signs include wearing a bandana, using a new nickname, using new or unusual slang words or hand signs, and graffiti-style \"tags\" on possessions, walls or buildings. \"Be aware that almost all of [these signs] are normal teenage behaviours and may not indicate gang involvement at all. However, where many of these signs are present, you should take action,\" says the booklet, drawn up with the help of the Association of Chief Police Officers, parenting organisations and community groups such as Mothers Against Violence.</p> <p>Parents are advised to be involved in their children's lives, to know their friends and their friends' families, and to encourage them to get involved in positive pastimes and activities.</p> <p>It reminds parents that girls can be involved too and tells them to be aware of their child's online habits as gangs will often use social networking websites. For those who believe their children are already involved, it recommends seeking help from community organisations that can offer mentoring, mediation, exit programmes and other ways to help them leave the gang.</p> <p>The home secretary said: \"All parents worry about keeping their children safe - and need support to help them to do it. They need to know how to spot if their child is involved in a gang and where to turn to if they are concerned.\"</p> <p>Fahy, who was sworn in yesterday as Greater Manchester chief constable, said he was prepared to use imaginative and high-risk tactics to tackle gun crime, with mediation for rival gang members, similar to a scheme in the West Midlands. \"You are talking about a group of people who are on the far edge of society and if you are to impact on them you have to be prepared to use imaginative and what may seem high-risk approaches in enforcing the law and dealing with the underlying causes,\" Fahy said. </p> <p>He revealed how he had been in danger of straying towards a life of crime as a young man growing up in the East End of London, but had been saved by his inspirational schoolteachers. \"If it had not been for one or two teachers I would have been stealing cars.\"</p>",
  "<p>Japan's beleaguered prime minister, Yasuo Fukuda, resigned yesterday, less than a year after taking office, in a move that threatens to plunge the world's second-biggest economy into political turmoil.</p> <p>Faced with poor poll ratings, policy deadlock and mounting economic problems, a grim-faced Fukuda said he had decided several days ago to step down to avoid creating a \"political vacuum\".</p> <p>Fukuda's resignation leaves the door open for Taro Aso, an outspoken right-winger whom Fukuda made secretary general of the ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) in last month's reshuffle.</p> <p>At a hastily arranged press conference in Tokyo, Fukuda conceded that a recent cabinet reshuffle and the announcement last week of $107bn (\u00a359bn) in extra spending and tax cuts had failed to boost support for his administration.</p> <p>Faced with an upper house controlled by opposition parties, Fukuda has failed to push through key legislation since he took office last September. Opposition parties, led by the Democrats, have blocked government bills and appointments, including Fukuda's preferred candidate for Bank of Japan governor. </p> <p>\"The power struggle in parliament has caused me many headaches,\" Fukuda said. \"I've tried to talk things through with the opposition, but they have voted against every single important government bill.\"</p> <p>Speculation that Fukuda would resign mounted after it became clear that his authority had been badly shaken in a row over the timing of the next parliamentary session. He had wanted parliament to meet last month to vote on the Afghanistan refuelling mission but was opposed by members of his party and the LDP's junior partner, New Komeito, who feared the debate would further damage the coalition's standing.</p> <p>The government has also been rocked by widespread anger over health insurance reforms that have forced many patients aged over 75 to pay more for medical treatment.</p> <p>Fukuda's departure promises to bring yet more political instability to Japan. His predecessor, Shinzo Abe, stepped down a year after taking office because of sagging popularity and poor health. Fukuda said: \"We can't allow progress to be stalled further, we must not create a political vacuum. Policy must be allowed to move forward so I have decided to step down as prime minister. The Japanese economy and Japanese people's livelihoods are at stake.\" Fukuda added that he decided to resign before the next parliamentary session begins on September 12. </p> <p>Despite opposition calls for a snap election, some observers expect the new leader to attempt to rebuild the party's popularity before the next general election is due in September 2009.</p>",
  "<p>A toddler who was accidentally shot in the head with an airgun by his five-year-old sister died in hospital yesterday.</p> <p>Rashid Ullah had been in a critical condition since the accident on August 24, when the 18-month-old's sister is understood to have shot him with a gun belonging to their father, Bakht Zaman. Zaman, 29, a handyman, had been using the weapon for target practice in their garden in Washwood Heath, Birmingham.</p> <p>Moments before the fatal accident, he is believed to have reloaded the air gun and turned his back on his children to answer his mobile phone. The children's grandfather, Bakht Rammand, later said that Rashid's sister then took the weapon, pointed it at her brother and shot him.</p> <p>\"Rashid's sister got hold of the gun and pointed it at her brother,\" he said at the time. \"He was on the high ground and she was on the low ground. It hit him right in the middle of the back of his head. Everybody's in shock.\"</p> <p>Bakht Zaman and his wife, Fazelat, had been keeping a bedside vigil at Birmingham Children's hospital when their son died. </p> <p>West Midlands police, who are treating the incident as a \"tragic accident\", said in a statement last night: \"Unfortunately 18-month-old Rashid Ullah died this afternoon as a result of his injuries. Rashid was hurt after he sustained a pellet wound in his head from an air weapon while he was in his garden in Washwood Heath on Sunday.\" </p> <p>Rashid's family were too upset to speak last night, but in a statement issued three days after the accident said: \"We hope that anyone who has an air weapon realises how dangerous these guns can be and what serious injuries they can cause.\"</p> <p>Rashid's death is likely to prompt more calls from campaigners for tighter gun controls. Rammand, 48, has supported the calls. \"We are devastated. I am not angry at my son but I am angry that he had this gun in his house,\" he said after the shooting. \"[Rashid's] little sister is too young to know what she has done but she is still very upset and is asking me where her little brother is.</p> <p>\"I think there should be tighter control on guns because it is too easy to buy these airguns.\"</p> <p>Most airguns do not require a firearms certificate but since October 2007 it has been illegal to sell an airgun to anyone under 18 and it is an offence to carry an airgun in a public place.</p> <p>In the aftermath of his shooting, the Gun Control Network, which campaigns for tighter controls on guns of all types, said: \"The tragic shooting of the toddler highlights once again the terrible consequences of the 'boys' toys' culture surrounding airgun ownership.</p> <p>\"This culture results in easy access, casual regard and non-accountability. Because airguns are not treated as real weapons they are not thought worthy of registration or regulation.</p> <p>\"They are not taken seriously. The adults who own these guns are rarely held to account. There is no law requiring them to store their weapons safely, nor is there any record of ownership.\"</p> <p>The group claimed that airguns were responsible for half of all firearms offences and caused more than a quarter of all serious firearms injuries.</p> <p>\"The government cannot hide behind recent changes in legislation, which failed to take the airgun problem seriously enough and make owners responsible for storing their weapons safely,\" said Andrew Picken, father of 12-year-old Mitchel Picken, who was killed in 2006 as his friends played with an air weapon. \"Airguns and their owners could be registered, and they should be.\"</p>",
  "<p>Greenpeace climate change activists who scaled one of Britain's tallest power station chimneys, causing \u00a330,000 damage, were accused in court yesterday of crossing the line of acceptable protest. </p> <p>Five activists, with food and water to stay four days, climbed the 200-metre chimney at Kingsnorth coal-fired power station near Hoo, Kent, last October. They had planned to daub \"Gordon, bin it\" on the outside of the chimney, but only got as far as painting the name \"Gordon\" before they came down after 30 hours, a jury at Maidstone crown court heard yesterday.</p> <p>Huw Williams, 41, from Nottingham; Ben Stewart, 34, from Lyminge, Kent; Kevin Drake, 44, from Westbury, Wiltshire; Will Rose, 29, from London; and Emily Hall, 34, from New Zealand are all charged with criminal damage to the chimney. Tim Hewke, 48, from Ulcombe, Kent, who the prosecution says helped organise the protest from the ground, is also charged with criminal damage. None of them deny causing the damage and they also accept the estimated costs of repairing the damage. </p> <p>The legality of causing the damage in the first place would be the central issue of the case, said John Price, prosecuting. \"These defendants maintain that they had a lawful excuse for damaging the chimney for the protection of other property. Other property, you will hear, in Kent and all around the world. Property said to be at the risk of more serious damage threatened by climate change which is caused by the substantial increase in greenhouse gases of which it is said coal-burning power stations make a large contribution.\" </p> <p>But he said the acts committed by the protesters were \"not capable of being lawful\". He told the jury of nine men and three women that the case was not a prosecution of free speech or legitimate political protest but a prosecution for crossing the line of acceptable protest. </p> <p>\"There are things you can lawfully do in making a protest, but there's a line which has to be drawn,\" he said. </p> <p>The activists, who begin their defence today, are expected to argue that they acted to prevent lives being lost and damage being done to properties around the world by global warming. It will be the first time that such a climate change defence has been used in a British court.</p> <p>The environment group is expected to call leading international climate change academics, researchers and environmentalists as witnesses.</p> <p>Greenpeace was in a similar situation in 1999 when Lord Melchett, its director at the time, along with others destroyed a field of GM crops in Norfolk. They said in court they were acting to prevent wider environmental damage. The not guilty verdict sent a message to environmental activists that they would not necessarily be punished under the law if they caused damage to property.</p> <p>The case, which is expected to run a further five days, has extra significance because of public opposition to Kingsnorth power station, and many people have pledged to disobey the law if a coal-fired station is built. More than 2,500 people demonstrated against it last month. </p> <p>Gordon Brown is expected to give approval to Kingsnorth in the next few months, making it the first new coal-fired station for 30 years. The case continues.</p>",
  "<p><br>Manchester City supporters reacted with a characteristic blend of cynicism and optimism to yesterday's extraordinary developments at Eastlands, with the overriding emotion one of relief that the controversial tenure of Thaksin Shinawatra was drawing to a close. </p> <p>Confirmation of the Abu Dhabi United Group's \u00a3200m takeover of City, followed swiftly by an astonishing \u00a334m bid for the long-time Manchester United target Dimitar Berbatov, Valencia's David Villa and Stuttgart's Mario G\u00f3mez, did not take only the manager Mark Hughes by surprise. City supporters, having spent this summer fretting over the club's financial future and tiring of Thaksin's attempts to flee corruption charges in Thailand, were similarly astounded at their involvement in the most dramatic transfer of deadline day. </p> <p>Kevin Parker, the general secretary of the Manchester City supporters' club, said: \"The takeover sounds very positive and it appears they have very, very deep pockets. While we don't know a great deal about the guy who's fronting the deal, and I suppose we should be cautious after everything that's happened, the reality is he cannot possibly have a past as chequered as the previous owner. </p> <p>\"We all knew the situation surrounding Dr Thaksin and, while I get the impression he'll be involved in the new setup in some capacity, maybe as president, there has been too much bad press about the club recently and it will just be good to get on the back pages again. The fans are happy with what's happening on the field at the moment under Mark Hughes. On the field has been good but it's been a nightmare off it.\" </p> <p>Parker believes the Abu Dhabi group will provide the \"stability and security\" that has been conspicuous by its absence at City recently, with the attempt to steal Berbatov from under the noses of their rivals an impressive statement of intent. \"If we get Berbatov, when everyone thought he was going to United, then it could be the most memorable day in the club's history,\" he added. \"Regardless, it has been an unbelievable day. There are no negative feelings about this at all. There are already some supporters down at the stadium dressed as Arabs.\" </p> <p>Others, however, had reservations about City remaining under foreign control after a turbulent 14 months under Thaksin. The editor of the King of the Kippax fanzine, Dave Wallace, admitted: \"Are we happy about it? The majority of supporters are only concerned with what happens on the pitch. Personally I don't like the idea of Manchester City being owned by Arabs or a former Thai prime minister but that's the way football is at the moment and what the Premier League has allowed to happen.</p> <p>\"Clubs that are owned by one person and heavily in debt wouldn't be allowed in Germany, for instance, but [Roman] Abramovich, the Glazers and now what is happening at City is what the Premier League is about. The traditional fan might not like it but as there are no shareholders at City any more there is nothing we can do about it.\"</p> <h2>How the day unfolded at Eastlands</h2> <p>9.45am Vedran Corluka waves goodbye to Eastlands as he signs for Tottenham Hotspur</p> <p>9.59am Arabian Business magazine reports Abu Dhabi United Group for Development and Investment have tied up a deal to buy City</p> <p>11.02am Abu Dhabi United Group says it has bought City.

  "<p>It must be unique for a billionaire's takeover to endear a club to people throughout the land. With the exception of Old Trafford devotees, however, no one could help but smirk yesterday at the thought, which was absurd until mid-morning, of Manchester City attempting to outbid United for Dimitar Berbatov. They would have been beaming in the White Hart Lane boardroom as a yearned-for auction became active at last.</p> <p>The advent of someone with Sulaiman Al Fahim's resources must also answer the prayers of the City fans, as it would for followers of most other clubs. A trend can seem irresistible and City were already among the nine Premier League members in foreign hands. Of the quartet who usually comprise the top four at the close of each campaign Arsenal are the sole club with a traditional air. Their supporters may now be more unsure than ever about the existing directors, share pact or not, keeping Alisher Usmanov or Stan Kroenke at bay.</p> <p>The contribution of new proprietors can of course be illusory. Manchester United's means have not, for example, been transformed by the Glazers, who put much of the debt they had incurred on the club's books.</p> <p>Those who scarcely need to keep track of their money are rare. So far as England is concerned, Roman Abramovich had hitherto been in a category of his own. He may class the money he bestows on Chelsea as loans but, in contrast to the Glazers, the oligarch shows no immediate craving to force the operation to run at a profit. </p> <p>Abramovich, in addition, was smart because he had identified a club already going places who were relatively cheap to acquire. Shortly before he bought out Ken Bates in 2003, Chelsea had ensured they would be entering the Champions League for a second time.</p> <p>There is no parallel with City, who have not laid hands on a major honour since the League Cup in 1976. Against such a grey backdrop, the disquieting note yesterday was the emphasis on landing a berth in next season's Champions League. The naming of that target risked instability. That pursuit of Berbatov was meant as a declaration of intent and an indication of the speed at which City would move.</p> <p>Al Fahim may be courting disappointment in the process. For all the exertions yesterday, hardly anyone can see the existing squad as the equal of Liverpool and Arsenal, let alone Manchester United or Chelsea. No matter what marvels are accomplished in the January transfer window it may be too late to make up lost ground. Any feeling of anticlimax would be ridiculous, but it might still be a cause of turbulence.</p> <p>Any manager who predates a proprietor typically has grim career prospects, and Mark Hughes will be all the more vulnerable if the expectations of him are steep. It would be terrible for City if he were treated as an element of the old regime that needed to be purged.</p> <p>Al Fahim, in the manner of Alan Sugar, has his own reality-TV show in which teams of businessmen compete against one another. With luck, that experience will assist him in detecting how impressive the current manager truly is. Over Hughes's three full seasons at Ewood Park, Blackburn Rovers came sixth, 10th and seventh in the Premier League. That was uncanny for a club who attract about 25,000 for the glamorous fixtures. In addition to his control of the side, he achieved that through keen wheeler-dealing and a gimlet eye for a footballer. David Bentley and the Paraguay striker Roque Santa Cruz were foremost among the extraordinary bargains.</p> <p>From the start, Hughes had shown that he makes outstanding use of whatever resources are placed in his hands. His first managerial post was with Wales and in that five-year spell a 2-1 win over Italy at the Millennium Stadium helped get the national team as far as a play-off with Russia for a berth at Euro 2004.</p> <p>In view of the results, the rise of Hughes has been slower than it ought to have been but he has had time to hone his approach. City's respectable start, six points from nine, reflects his talent at least as much as Thaksin Shinawatra's funding of signings. Last month Hughes conveyed strength of character when speculation swirled that there would be a fire sale of players, but he also stopped well short of suggesting that he was at war with the club's then owner. He was measured and imposing.</p> <p>It must be Al Fahim's wish to make City unrecognisable in their new prominence, but to do so he should ensure that the manager continues to be a familiar face.</p>",

  "<p>When the Beatles landed in New York for the first time in February 1964, they were met by 5,000 screaming teenage fans and Jack Hutton. As editor of the Melody Maker, Hutton - who has died aged 80 after a long illness - was in the city to listen to jazz and interview American musicians. His on-the-spot position enabled him to direct the paper's lavish coverage of the first wave of what became known as the British invasion, a phenomenon that was to revolutionise popular music in the US and around the world.</p> <p>A few weeks earlier Hutton had led a minor revolution of his own, supervising a redesign of the Melody Maker and its simultaneous transfer from the old hot metal production process to the new web offset technology. The new look, brighter and more dynamic, suited the changing mood of the 1960s and helped Hutton in his fight to modernise the paper. He and his reporters had already embraced the arrival of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and those who followed in their wake with an enthusiasm that gave them an advantage in their circulation battle against the market-leading New Musical Express.</p> <p>Founded in 1926, the Melody Maker had become known as \"the musicians' bible\", and Hutton's bold redesign enabled it to brush away the cobwebs lingering from its origins as the house journal of dance bands and crooners. But it was a background in jazz and blues, which Hutton shared with most of his staff, that enabled the paper to establish a strong rapport with the new generation. \"You can talk sense to them,\" Paul McCartney said in 1964.</p> <p>Among musicians, Hutton's friends and acquaintances were legion. He was able to interview many of those he admired, such as Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Pee Wee Russell and Sidney Bechet, and among his many stories was the one about taking Billie Holiday on a shopping trip to Marks &amp; Spencer where, upon reaching the front of the queue to pay for her purchases, she amazed the assistants and customers by hoisting up her skirt to retrieve a roll of banknotes from her undergarments. He was with the Stones in the Chess studios in Chicago when they recorded It's All Over Now, their first No 1 hit, in 1964.</p> <p>In later years he became a successful publisher, co-founding a company, Spotlight Publications, that launched several successful music periodicals, including Sounds, Popswap and Kerrang!, during his period as editorial director and later as managing director.</p> <p>Like most of those with whom he shared the Melody Maker's offices in the 1960s, Hutton had a background in regional newspapers. Born in Sydney, Australia, while his mother and his father, a ship's engineer, were en route home to Scotland, he was brought up in Dundee and joined the powerful locally based publishing firm of DC Thomson at the age of 15. There he worked on the company's highly successful series of weekly comics, including Dandy, Beano and Hotspur. National service with the RAF, where he heard the recordings of the veteran New Orleans trumpeter Bunk Johnson and began a lifelong interest in jazz, was followed by a period back in his home city on the Sunday Post, where he and his fiancee, Joyce Fisker, founded the Dundee Jazz Society.</p> <p>He and Joyce were married by the time they moved to London in 1954, where he had the choice of jobs with the Daily Sketch, the Evening Standard and the Melody Maker. Accepting the lowest of the three salaries on offer, he began work as a writer and layout subeditor on the music weekly, where the arrival of a shortlived but intense British craze for trad jazz, a simplified form of the New Orleans music that had originally inspired him, brought him into contact with the likes of Acker Bilk, Chris Barber, Kenny Ball, Humphrey Lyttelton, Alex Welsh and Sandy Brown. Hutton had taken up the trumpet during his national service years and played in various amateur bands, often using a cornet given him by Welsh, until illness took hold in his mid-70s.</p> <p>Taking over as the paper's editor from the long-serving Pat Brand in 1962, he accepted the challenge of attacking the NME on the pop front while maintaining the coverage of jazz, folk and blues that gave the MM a greater credibility among musicians. Thanks to his redesign, and to the careful nurturing of a stable of contributors that included such young pop writers as Nick Jones, Chris Welch and Tony Wilson alongside the jazz critics Max Jones, Bob Dawbarn, Val Wilmer and Bob Houston, the foundations were laid for a campaign that would bear fruit a decade later, when the paper, under his former deputy, Ray Coleman, overtook its chief rival while passing the 200,000 circulation mark.</p> <p>In 1970, however, with the paper in the ascendant, Hutton and the MM's circulation director, Peter Wilkinson, announced their departure from IPC, the paper's owners, to start a new company with financial backing from City Magazines, owned by the young Rupert Murdoch. The first project was Sounds, a weekly paper devoted to progressive rock and described by Hutton, to those he was attempting to recruit from his former publication, as \"a leftwing Melody Maker\".</p> <p>With such writers as Penny Valentine, Steve Peacock and Jerry Gilbert, the paper gradually established itself. The growth proved too slow for Murdoch, however, and Hutton and Wilkinson forged an alliance with Morgan Grampian that was to prove more enduring, allowing them to undertake a number of initiatives. Hutton supervised the fortunes of Music Week, Eve, Over 21 and many other publications until his retirement in 1987.</p> <p>Sounds closed in 1991, followed into oblivion nine years later by the Melody Maker. But Hutton had left an enduring mark on a singularly exciting period in the history of popular music and on the careers of many young journalists whose talents he encouraged. He became ill in 2003 with tubercular meningitis and died after suffering a chest infection.</p> <p><strong>Val Wilmer writes: </strong>Jack Hutton was a reassuring presence at Melody Maker, which had already been publishing my music photographs. When I began writing about jazz as well as taking photographs it must have been quite a shock to some on the staff. Hutton's friendly paternalism and the encouragement of his fellow Scot Bob Houston helped dampen the worst of the banter.</p> <p>Hutton hired Penny Valentine to write for Disc, then took her with him to Sounds, using my photographs for its dummy edition. When they were stolen in a burglary targeted at securing such archive material, to reappear as copy-prints sold in Soho, he was very supportive.</p> <p>In 2003, although clearly unwell himself, he attended Valentine's funeral. \"Got to be here for Penny,\" he insisted, his decency reminding me of another traditional value that existed in Fleet Street back in the day.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jack Hutton, journalist and publisher, born April 17 1928; died August 24 2008</p>",
  "<p>Iraqi security forces took control of Sunni Anbar province from the US military yesterday, a milestone in moves to wind down the American presence in a key area that was an insurgent stronghold.</p> <p>Iraqi troops paraded with flags flying at a formal handover ceremony in the provincial capital Ramadi, once a byword for vicious fighting, though underlying political tensions are yet to be resolved.</p> <p>\"This war is not quite over, but it's being won and primarily by the people of Anbar,\" declared the US commander, Marine Major General John Kelly. \"Al-Qaida has not been entirely defeated in Anbar, but their end is near and they know it. What Anbar needs now, what will end this conflict and prevent al-Qaida from ever coming back, is economic development, reconstruction and funds for compensation.\"</p> <p>In Washington President George Bush praised the achievement, saying that the province had been \"transformed and reclaimed by the Iraqi people\".</p> <p>Anbar, which is mostly desert, extends from the western outskirts of Baghdad to the borders of Syria, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. It saw some of the bloodiest fighting after the 2003 invasion, including two assaults by US forces on Falluja.</p> <p>About one third of US fatalities in Iraq, 1,305 troops, have been in Anbar, more than 40% of them by improvised explosive devices.</p> <p>It is the 11th of Iraq's 18 provinces but the first majority Sunni one to be handed over to the Shia-led Baghdad government.</p> <p>US forces are to remain but in a limited \"overwatch\" role in which they will cut back on security patrols and focus on training Iraq's army and police. The US has 28,000 soldiers in Anbar, down from 37,000 in February, while the number of Iraqi soldiers and police has grown to 37,000 from 5,000 three years ago.</p> <p>The handover is expected to help the US cut troop levels in Iraq at a time when there is pressure to boost forces in Afghanistan, where violence is now worse.</p> <p>\"We would not have even imagined this in our wildest dreams three or four years ago,\" said the Iraqi national security adviser, Mowaffaq al-Rubaie. </p> <p>\"If we had said we were going to hand over security responsibility from foreign troops to civilian authority people would laugh at us.\"</p> <p>The handover had been scheduled for June but was delayed by a row between local leaders and a bomb attack in Ramadi. Anbar was the bastion of al-Qaida in Iraq and its renegade Jordanian leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who used the area as a staging-ground for attacks in Baghdad until he was killed in a 2006 US airstrike. Two years ago a US intelligence report concluded that al-Qaida had made such inroads that the war was lost in Anbar. </p> <p>The tide began to turn in late 2006, when Sunni tribal leaders alienated by al-Qaida atrocities changed sides, forming US-funded \"awakening councils\" that became a model for grassroots guard units across the country.</p> <p>Security progress after the US troop surge has not been matched by internal political reconciliation. The Iraqi parliament has yet to pass a controversial election law that has been delayed by a dispute over the oil-rich northern province of Kirkuk. </p> <p>Provincial elections - seen by both Washington and Baghdad as a key development - can be held this year only if agreement can be reached in the next two weeks.</p>",
  "<p>Undoubtedly the media must take a large share of the blame for the MMR debacle (MMR was the biggest science story in years - and a hoax, August 30), but the biggest culprit must surely be the government. Confronted with the sudden publicity for Andrew Wakefield's research, the response of any sensible authority would be to acknowledge that it raised issues of concern to all parents, to announce that further research would be put in hand as a matter of urgency and to promise that, in spite of having the utmost confidence in the triple vaccination, it would offer the option of single jabs if parents wished. This would almost certainly have meant that the story would have been forgotten within a few weeks.</p> <p>However, the government's panic reaction was to rubbish the findings and, more especially, to try to smear Dr Wakefield. It then compounded its errors by refusing to make separate vaccinations available. Hence, the public, spurred on by the media, assumed that there was indeed something to hide, with the resultant disastrous reduction in the take-up of vaccination.<br><strong>Simon R Hill</strong><br>London</p> <p>Being the grandfather of an autistic child, I read Ben Goldacre's article with interest. I've witnessed the huge strain this condition puts on family life and it's not surprising that MMR became such an emotive issue.</p> <p>Yes, you rightly apportion a lot of the blame to the media. But you don't say anything in defence of Dr Wakefield, who eventually became a figure of hate. I am convinced that he is a sincere, honest man, and that he has been unfairly vilified. And I'm not entirely convinced that he was wrong. You try persuading my wife that our little granddaughter would now be autistic if her mother had not been bullied into giving her the MMR vaccine.<br><strong>Philip Pendered</strong><br>Tonbridge, Kent</p> <p>Ben Goldacre is right - the media are responsible for some terrible and harmful public health scares. But journalists from an arts rather than science background - as so many are - are not stupid. Is it simply that they do not understand the complexity of the arguments and blunder carelessly into hurting innocent victims? I doubt it. Is it not more likely that using one of their own perfectly respectable academic models, like literary criticism, they truly believe they are doing the right thing in weighing the opinions of individual voices, especially charismatic or \"interesting\" ones? Is that not the best way to decide a debate and conclude upon accepted wisdom? More knowledge of scientific method is urgently required, not more finger-pointing. Humility on all sides (and an apology from the Blairs) would help. <br><strong>Stephen Singleton</strong><br>Newcastle upon Tyne</p> <p>The media may be the prime culprit but what of the National Autistic Society, who sat on the fence as this one ran and ran? It seems it still cannot acknowledge the harm done by Wakefield and any cronies he may have had within the NAS establishment to science and public health.<br><strong>Michael Baron</strong><br>Chair, NAS 1962-1967</p> <p>Ben Goldacre is right to say that \"individuals like Wakefield must be free to have bad ideas\". The Lancet acknowledged this by publishing his original article with an editorial pointing out its scientific flaws. But Wakefield alone was responsible for calling a press conference at the Royal Free, coinciding with this publication, to call for the abandonment of the triple vaccine before any proper research had been done. Well aware of the scientific ignorance of the media, he still chose to light the fuse.<br><strong>Steve Thorn</strong><br>Coylton, Devon</p> <p>The article on MMR was very interesting, but unfortunately your picture editor got the photo of Ben Goldacre wrong. I know for a fact that Goldacre is a man-monster, 150 years old, with a head bulging with brains. The handsome young man in the picture probably works in your reception.<br><strong>Elizabeth Sisupalan</strong><br>London</p>",
  "<p>Forensic scientists were last night studying the remains of a third body found in the burnt-out Shropshire mansion of the millionaire businessman Christopher Foster. The remains were discovered across the hall in the main part of Osbaston House from the gutted front room, where teeth and bone fragments of Jill Foster, 49, and an unidentified man were found at the weekend close to a 0.22 rifle.</p> <p>Detectives have upgraded the original arson investigation into a murder inquiry, but are not yet confirming that Christopher Foster, 50, and his 15-year-old daughter, Kirstie, are the two unknown victims at the isolated house near Maesbrook hamlet. A round-the-clock search is continuing.</p> <p>The family was last seen returning to the 15-acre estate after a barbecue at a Shropshire car dealer's home a week last night. Friends of Kirstie, who was due to return to her boarding school at nearby Ellesmere this week, said she had abruptly left an internet chat in the early hours.</p> <p>Foster's oil rig insulation business faced debts of more than \u00a31m. His flamboyant lifestyle, with two Porsches and an Aston Martin in the ruined stableblock, went with business practices which a high court judge described this year as \"bereft of the basic instincts of commercial morality\".</p> <p>West Mercia police, which has more than 100 officers on the case, said it could not confirm reports that court bailiffs had arrived at the house on Tuesday morning to find it devastated and sealed off. County courts at Oswestry, five miles away, and Birmingham had no comment on the claim.</p> <p>Detective Superintendent Jon Groves said removal of the third set of remains would \"take time because of its position\". Identification of the man's remains and cause of death is also proceeding slowly.</p> <p>\"We had the [third set of] remains confirmed as human late last night by a Home Office pathologist and we are hoping to get the body out by the end of Monday, with a postmortem taking place either Monday night or Tuesday,\" he said. \"A forensic archaeologist is due to visit the site to offer specialist advice.\"</p> <p>Officers are having to work gingerly beneath shored-up walls stripped of plaster by the fire. The site has had to be evacuated several times after further debris fell.</p> <p>Detectives have established that Mrs Foster, whose 4x4 with the number plate JILL40 was also destroyed, was shot through the head. Autopsies have been carried out on the remains of Kirstie's three horses, Scrumpy Jack, Breezy and Bramble, which she described on the internet site Bebo as central to her life. They had been shot, along with the family's four dogs.</p> <p>Friends of the family visited the edge of the garden at Osbaston House yesterday to leave flowers. Fiona Bray, whose daughter Megan clung to her tightly as they passed the police cordon in a single-track lane, said: \"We have heard things said about the Fosters that are just not true. We have come to pay our respects because Megan went to school with Kirstie and we were very close to the family. They were a lovely bunch of people.\" </p> <p>Police are still examining the remains of a CCTV security system found at the house and what is left of two computers. Spent and unspent gun cartridges found in the grounds are also being checked and fingerprint and DNA specialists are working on the family's horsebox, which was left with its tyres punctured in front of the main electronic gates.</p> <p>Kirstie's headmaster, Brendan Wignall, said everyone at her school was \"deeply concerned\" by the discovery of the third body. He said: \"Despite the obvious speculation, I feel that it would be inappropriate to comment further but we are all deeply concerned about this latest development in the ongoing investigation.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"It's time to take off our Republican hats and put on our American hats,\" John McCain told his party at the weekend, which must have come as a shock to many, as ridiculous hats are the main point of US political conventions. Despite McCain's admonition, several pieces of red-white-and-blue headgear were spotted in St Paul yesterday, including two that bore the single, rousing word that inspires Republicans everywhere: not \"hope\", or \"change\", but \"drill!\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Nonetheless, the change of tone is detectable. The convention party originally called Political Chicks A Go-Go! has been turned into a sombre fundraiser. \"Tonight we will bring together our peers who are in Minnesota and make plans to respond as a community and a movement accordingly,\" the organisers announced, which doesn't sound very A Go-Go! \"The Democratic party is about making sure everybody has a good time, has drinks, has cocktail parties,\" a Republican operative at a typically low-key party explained to one journalist. \"The Republican party is about making sure everybody has a place to live. A place to be safe.\" The operative reportedly \"swayed slightly\" as he spoke. But that was presumably just because he was overcome with empathy.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The worst omen for the McCainiacs is surely that the news anchors are fleeing St Paul, bound for the hurricane zone - or, in the case of MSBNC's Keith Olbermann, returning to New York to coordinate coverage, which sounds rather like an excuse for going home early. At the Mall of America in nearby Minneapolis - America's second-biggest shopping centre, which features an integrated amusement park - there was nobody at all in the \"reporters' retreat\", a media centre set up to lure the cameras into using the mall as a backdrop for their reports. Not that the mall's shopkeepers were helping add to the convention buzz either: one store selling Republican convention merchandise felt compelled to display a sign explaining that this didn't mean the owners backed McCain. The official convention hotels, meanwhile, are greeting guests with enormous red signs reading: \"Welcome!\" - and in letters so small you have to peer closely to make them out: \"Republican National Convention\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Most people know little about McCain's running-mate, Sarah Palin: a recent USA Today poll suggested that 51% of American voters had never heard of her. Troublingly, even Palin's mother-in-law seems in the dark about her qualities. \"I'm not sure what she brings to the ticket other than she's a woman and a conservative,\" Faye Palin said. \"Well, she's a better speaker than McCain.\" Clearly, Faye missed Cindy McCain's weekend interview with ABC, in which she explained that Alaska is \"the closest part of our continent to Russia\", and that Palin \"was a member of the PTA\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Another compelling reason to rally behind John McCain in this time of crisis, rather than, say, Barack Obama: Obama will steal the food from your plate. At a restaurant in the minuscule town of Hamilton, amid the soybean fields of Indiana, local woman Luanna Gearhart stepped away from her seat for a few minutes; when she returned she was taken aback to find the Democratic candidate for president sitting in it, eating her food. \"He's eating our appetizers,\" she observed. \"But God's made it this way.\" Every time someone says something like this, a member of John McCain's campaign team dies.</p>",
  "<p>The School-Home Support Service is an independent charity that provides support workers in schools across the UK. I'm based in a secondary, but also work with the feeder primaries, supporting families where there are issues that are getting in the way of children's learning. </p> <p>Often teachers might identify that there is something going on at home, but where they don't have the time to investigate it, I can. It might be domestic violence, housing, behaviour, debt - the whole range of issues. </p> <p>Because we are not part of social services and we're independent of the school, parents are often more open to talking to us and trust us more. We are all about early intervention, so we work with families who probably don't meet the threshold for social services. We have the time to spend listening to parents, and we have the knowledge and background to signpost organisations and services within the borough. </p> <p>Part of our role is meeting parents in the playground, running coffee mornings and parenting classes. Parents often self-refer, or a teacher will ask if they would like us to ring. I spend some of my days doing home visits and I give parents the option to meet at home or at school or even in a caf\u00e9, somewhere neutral - not everyone wants me popping round. If they meet me at school and get to know me, then they may invite me round. </p> <p>The best bit of my job is building relationships with parents and getting to know them and their children. It can be a very empowering experience for parents. When you first meet they may not have that much confidence, but after a few sessions, or after coming to parenting classes, they are brimming with it: some have gone on to university or back to work. And those sorts of things make a big difference to families. </p> <p></p>",
  "<p>It's no good, I have to come clean. I felt guilty the moment I wrote it down, and now I need to put things right. In an earlier column (June 3), I wrote \"the most common number of readers for academic papers, once published, is zero\". This was subsequently quoted on the letters page (June 7). Well, I have always considered myself a bit of a purist about statistics, and keep a very high horse for times when I need to look down on other people's misuse. So, with great regret, I have to clamber into the saddle to pour scorn on myself.</p> <p>In partial defence, I did say that this is something I had heard, and didn't know whether it is true, or how it was possible to tell. But in fact it is almost certainly true, and we can know so without even doing any studies. Most people will have come away with the impression that I was suggesting that more papers go unread rather than read. My confession is that all along I knew that what I said doesn't mean this at all. </p> <p>Let me explain. Of all the papers ever published, some will have been read perhaps tens of thousands of times, others thousands, and all the way down the scale to zero. Maybe you can see where this is heading. It seems unlikely that the most common number of readers is going to be, say, 1,352. Small numbers are likely to come up more often, and the most likely of all is probably zero, even if that is only a tiny fraction of all papers. So the most common number of readers may be none. Big deal.</p> <p>So continueth today's lesson, on the ambiguity of the concept of \"average\". Remember that it used to be said that the average family in the UK had 2.4 children? That made us all giggle (especially those of us who thought we knew someone who could be counted as 0.4). But of course this was the average in the sense of the mean: take the total number of children in all families and divide it by the number of families. QED.</p> <p>But there are other concepts of average, too, the median and the mode. The median is \"the one in the middle\". So the median number of children in families in the UK now is probably two. If you line up all families, with those with no children at one end, and those with loads and loads at the other end, the family in the middle probably has two.</p> <p>The mode means \"most common\" number. Looking at these families again, it may well be that the most common number of children is two, but then it might be one or zero (as in the case of the journal papers). So averages are tricky and shifty. When the mean, mode and median come apart, don't risk your money.</p> <p>And there are so many examples. A while ago I heard it reported that 90% of men thought that they were of above-average athletic ability. What typical male vanity! How can more than 50% of people be above-average anything? Well, very easily, actually, if by average we mean \"mean\" rather than \"median\". Ask yourself: what is the mean number of legs possessed by human beings? Bearing in mind that, very sadly, a small number of people have a single leg, or none at all, the answer is something like 1.9999. Therefore, almost everyone has an above-average number of legs.</p> <p>In Lake Wobegon, so Garrison Keillor told us, the women are strong, the men are good-looking, and the children are all above average. A wonderful joke, but rather spoilt if you realise that it can almost be true (one rather dim child and all the others at the same level). Indeed, boringly, it could be literally true if the reference class is all children, and not just those in Lake Wobegon.</p> <p>So let me end on a warm, comforting and positive note. If it is true that the (modal) average number of readers of academic papers is zero, then it is also true that almost all academic papers have an above-average number of readers. I knew that would cheer you up.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Jonathan Wolff is professor of philosophy at University College London</p>",
  "<p>Industrial disputes are hardly welcome news but the authors of a new report on the changing status of further education lecturers could be forgiven some grim satisfaction over battles brewing at two colleges.</p> <p>The University and College Union is bracing itself for a scrap at Bishop Auckland College in county Durham, where the management says a looming financial crisis is forcing it to seek a change in contracts for all teaching staff.</p> <p>And at Coleg Menai in north Wales, lecturers have voted to take part in industrial action in a dispute over class sizes and teaching hours, which UCU is billing as a defence of educational quality and professional standards.</p> <p>Whatever the rights and wrongs in these situations, each surely chimes with the core thesis of the report by three academics specialising in industrial relations and management, that the increasingly market-oriented approach in further education demanded by government has diminished the professional status of teachers in colleges.</p> <p>Nowhere in the public sector has the pace of change been more rapid than in further education, triggered by the \"incorporation\" of colleges in 1993 and their independence from local authorities, argue Kim Mather, Les Worrall and Roger Seifert.</p> <p>The result, they say, is that teaching in further education has been degraded and deskilled. Lecturers are increasingly directed by managers who are as interested in achieving efficiency as in the education of students.</p> <p>Although concepts such as inspirational leadership and empowerment are talked up in management literature, the reality for further education lecturers appears to be \"increased centralised control, reduced autonomy, job degradation, cost reduction and strategies to improve productivity by intensifying the utilisation of labour\", say the report's authors, all senior academics at Midlands universities.</p> <p>Lecturers' ability to decide what they teach and how has been eroded. In some cases management has started to see lecturers almost as interchangeable units. At one Midlands college where the authors conducted their research they found a philosophy lecturer timetabled to teach basic skills to trainee hairdressers.</p> <p>Lecturers forced into such situations complain of little time to prepare for unfamiliar subjects. They resent teaching from \"instructor packs\" and using materials that they have had no hand in designing.</p> <p>But perhaps the most undermining aspect of being shoved from subject to subject is, they feel, the lack of regard for their expertise in their own discipline. One theory considered by the report is that further education lecturers have been particularly vulnerable to reform. They have lacked professional recognition historically, partly because they are such a diverse bunch with such a wide range of prior professional experience, particularly among those teaching vocational subjects. </p> <p>But it is not all the managers' fault. Some lecturers blame government for an approach that puts business efficiency over education and regards students as customers. \"FE management is not about helping students learn - it is about obeying the threats of a series of governments, which have neither understood, nor loved, FE,\" one lecturer told the authors. And here there is probably common ground between lecturers and management. </p> <p>Bishop Auckland College has been forced to seek changes in contracts with 305 teaching and support staff because dramatic funding changes brought in by government have helped push up staffing costs to an unsustainable level, says its principal Joanna Tait. According to a regional UCU official, Joyce McAndrew, the college is trying to force its staff to accept inferior working conditions without proper negotiations. Tait says she has \"absolutely no intention of changing terms and conditions without full and proper consultation\". </p> <p>The government's insistence on colleges competing for ever more of their funding is putting more pressure on management, she says. Colleges are like hospitals, which lose so many beds in the name of efficiency that they are no longer able to cope with major crises.</p> <p>\"The tension we have to live with is that we are supposed to be infinitely flexible - dropping everything to do something tomorrow - but at the same time we need to have some steady core,\" she says.</p> <p>\"I am very much opposed to the introduction of market values into the management of FE because I don't think it fits at all well, but we have to live in a system where we are being asked to promote ourselves in this way.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> The Changing Locus of Workplace Control in the English Further Education sector, by Kim Mather, Les Worrall &amp; Roger Seifert, will be published in Employee Relations journal</p>",
  "<p>Their patches back on to each other, divided by a difference in postcode - B6 and B21 - and the A34 Birchfield Road. Catch yourself on one side of the dividing line and you are in Burger Bar Boy turf, step across it and suddenly you are in the Johnston Gang's manor. Transgress into the wrong territory, get spotted and you could be history. </p> <p>This is the reality on the troubled streets of Birmingham's Lozells, Handsworth, Newtown and Aston areas, thickly populated, socially deprived inner city estates that have been peppered by the bullets of gang warfare for more than a decade. The killing of Dimitri Foskin, 24, last month near his home in Newtown brought Birmingham and its gangs attention not seen since two young women, Letisha Shakespeare, 17, and Charlene Ellis, 18, were killed in the crossfire at a party outside an Aston hairdresser's early on New Year's Day 2003. In the year that they had just celebrated passing, the war between the Burgers and the Johnstons claimed 27 young lives. </p> <p>In the last month in Birmingham, there have been two drive-by shootings, a fatal stabbing and the killing of Foskin. Now police and community activists are trying to piece these events together and see if they have a common thread: of revenge and retaliation. Kirk Dawes, a former police officer who now runs the West Midlands Mediation and Transformation Service, said: \"We try to conflict-map it, find out what was the catalyst for this behaviour, find out whether it goes back all the way. What happened in the past is the issue and that is what's going to drive it. It's a nonsense that they are killing to move up the ranks or earn stripes within their gang. It's because 'they did it to my friend or my brother or whatever'. Within the black community, issues of respect play a fantastic part in all of this. Something happens and they think 'we have got to back him' and it causes gang warfare.\"</p> <p>Where the gangs began in Birmingham is open to debate, but in the 1990s the biggest networks were the Burgers (named after the burger joint they hung out in in Soho Road) and the Johnstons, aka Johnnies and JC, (named similarly after a cafe, in Heathfield Road). Aside from bullets, the gangs dealt in crack cocaine and created a kind of carnage the city had never seen. Soon enough, they had smaller crews affiliated to them - the Badder Bar Crew, the Bang Bang Crew, the Cash or Slash Money Crew and the Raiders, to name just four. Dawes said the groups could be based on postcode. \"When you have one violent incident after another, people feel the need to take sides. That's what we are seeing now.\"</p> <p>The New Year's Day killings - which can be traced back to the murder of Yohanne Martin, a key Burger, in December 2002 - led to the conviction of a number of gang \"kingpins\" and many of the more senior members moved into the shadows. This, say some, has created a vacuum into which younger, more chaotic, less disciplined gang members have moved, though Dawes says there are still 400 proper gang players in Birmingham. </p> <p>Dr Derrick Campbell, chair of the National Independent Advisory Group on Criminal Use of Firearms, which liaises with the Home Office, said: \"When the individual leaders were taken out of the system we had a lot of splinters. Now there is a lack structure, people are trying to find their own way forward and they are jockeying for position. </p> <p>\"You have people walking around with bulletproof vests and guns wanting to exact revenge. There is no sense of management and control. That's what makes it even more scary.\" Campbell says this has been made worse by cuts in grants for agencies working to tackle the roots of the problem.</p> <p>\"Evidence shows that organisations that have been delivering a very good service, engaging the confidence and trust of young people, and black young people in particular, those organisations have lost funding and those young people have gone back into criminal activity.\" </p> <p>A rapper named Witness, born Adrian Burke, who uses his lyrics to tackle issues such as gun crime and sits on the Birmingham Reducing Gang Violence Group says gangs attract young black men who have mostly grown up in fatherless households and are looking for identity and significance.</p> <p>\"They seem to have some sort of loving there in the gangs. What is scary now is that children as young as five and six are talking to me and what they have seen in their brother's bedroom is not porn, it's guns. They are telling me about gangs. It's becoming a culture, with young kids at junior school representing their gangs, 10-year-olds pledging allegiance to gangs who can tell you in intimate detail what's going on in the street, talking about Glocks and semi-automatic hand pistols,\" he said. </p> <p>\"These kids suffer from mental health issues, low self-esteem, trauma from seeing people being shot in front of them. And the younger the lieutenants get, the more dangerous it is going to get. It's moved from behaviour to culture. I have been nervous before, but it is starting again. And it's scary.\"</p>",

  "<p>Gordon Brown's inner circle moved last night to close ranks in support of Alistair Darling after signs of a fall-out between 10 and 11 Downing Street prompted a dramatic fall in the value of the pound.</p> <p>Hours after authoritative government sources indicated Darling could be vulnerable in the next reshuffle, the PM's closest cabinet ally indicated that the chancellor's position was safe. Ed Balls, the schools secretary, told ITV News: \"I have no reason to believe there's any prospect in any change in the chancellor ... I think it would be the wrong thing to do.\"</p> <p>But Balls indicated continuing irritation with David Miliband, weeks after the foreign secretary sparked speculation about his leadership intentions with a Guardian article on how Labour should launch a fightback. Balls observed cabinet convention by saying that Miliband was not challenging the prime minister, but he pointedly warned that to do so would be \"crazy, destructive and divisive\".</p> <p>The former chief economist at the Treasury, Brown's closest aide until he stood for parliament in 2005, spoke as the fallout from Darling's Guardian interview over the weekend was in danger of spiralling out of control. Brown's deep irritation over Darling's gloomy take on economic conditions was reflected in an authoritative briefing in yesterday's Times that the chancellor was \"wrong\" and had damaged his position. Darling told the Guardian that some people had their eye on his job or were actively trying to do it, which some saw as a veiled reference to Balls.</p> <p>But last night Balls said: \"I don't want his job. What I want to do is get on with the job I'm doing. We've got rising primary and secondary school standards.\"</p> <p>But he highlighted one area where Brown was particularly irritated by the reporting of Darling's interview: the suggestion Britain alone was suffering the worst economic conditions in 60 years. Downing Street accepts Darling made clear to the Guardian that he was warning that the world is facing economic downturn, though they believe the chancellor was not clear enough. Balls said: \"It's important to get the balance of that message.\"</p> <p>The intervention by Balls shows the balance of power in the cabinet has changed in the wake of Darling's interview. The chancellor is weakened in the eyes of the Brown circle but the fallout from his interview means it would be difficult, if not impossible, to remove him. The Tories say they would accuse the Brown of \"sacking the chancellor for telling the truth.\"</p> <p>The appearance of a rift in Downing Street will strengthen the hands of ministers and backbenchers who believe the prime minister needs to go. A tiny group, dubbed the Blairite Taliban, want Brown to go immediately. But a broader group believes he should be given a clear run until parliament returns next month, after the party conferences, to revive his premiership. If he fails to dent the Tory poll lead by winter, then they expect him to face intense pressure.</p> <p>A senior Labour MP said there could be an \"orderly\" move against Brown involving one or more members of the cabinet. Failing that, it would be \"disorderly\", with a revolt from those backbenchers most anxious about losing their seats.</p> <h2>What next for the PM?</h2> <p><strong>Cabinet </strong>Brown will want to show that he commands the confidence of and is wholly supportive of his cabinet. </p> <p><strong>Labour conference </strong>The prime minister will need to persuade a sceptical party and public that he is capable of leading them out of the economic and political crisis. His performance over the next month is likely to determine whether he survives.</p> <p><strong>Byelection</strong> The death of John MacDougall, MP for Glenrothes, means the PM faces another difficult byelection. Labour last night selected the headteacher of Brown's former school, Lindsay Roy, 59, to fight the seat. No 10 is expected to wait until after Labour's conference before defending the seat.</p> <p><strong>Economy</strong> Alistair Darling is expected to deliver his pre-budget report earlier than expected in an attempt to show the government is focusing on measures to help people through the downturn.</p>",

  "<p>Sterling tumbled to a record low against the euro yesterday and to its weakest level against the dollar for over two years after Alistair Darling's weekend comments about the economy facing its biggest challenge for 60 years.</p> <p>Although Treasury officials stressed that the chancellor was talking about the credit crunch and high oil and food prices facing the world economy more generally, traders sold the pound heavily, pushing it to less than $1.80 at one point and to 81.4p to the euro.</p> <p>A month ago the pound would buy $2 and a euro could be bought for 78p. Bank of England data show that sterling has fallen almost 5% in the past month against a basket of major currencies, pummelled by a string of weak economic data, suggesting growth had ground to a halt in the second quarter of the year. The pound fell 8.6% against the dollar in August, its worst monthly performance since October 1992, when it came out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.</p> <p>Figures yesterday from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply showed that the manufacturing sector had suffered its fourth monthly output decline in August. Along with further weakness in mortgage approvals, the data seemed to back up what Darling had been talking about and reinforced the selling of sterling. \"Investors saw it as an easy opportunity to have a go at a wounded animal,\" said Maurice Pomery, senior strategist at IDEAglobal.</p> <p>Royal Bank of Scotland analyst Paul Robson said: \"The data shows no sign of improving and while that continues people will bring forward the possible timing of the first Bank of England rate cut.\"</p> <p>The Bank of England has left interest rates steady at 5% despite the deteriorating economic outlook because it is concerned about rising inflation, which is at 4.4%, the highest for 16 years and more than double the Bank's government-set target of 2%.</p> <p>The fall in the value of the pound, stressed Stephen Lewis, economist at Insinger de Beaufort, should be good news for the ailing British economy.</p> <p>\"Sterling's slide will boost UK import costs but should improve UK exporters' international competitiveness,\" he said. \"It is a development that should help the re-balancing of the UK economy towards exports, provided the Bank of England and the Treasury keep tight control over domestic demand.\"</p> <p>Oil prices also fell sharply yesterday, dropping more than $4 a barrel to a four-month low of $110.60 for US light crude futures after it became apparent that the Gulf storm would cause less damage than expected. Fears that the credit crisis is damaging growth across the world and thereby hampering global demand for crude are also holding back oil prices.</p> <p>\"Worries about an economic slowdown spreading to the eurozone and worries that oil demand growth in emerging markets may slow later this year are creating the bearish sentiment in the oil market,\" Singapore-based energy analyst Victor Shum said.</p> <p>Falling oil prices also weighed on leading shares, dragging the FTSE 100 down 34 points, or 0.6%, to close at 5,602.8. Cairn Energy, Tullow Oil, BG Group and Royal Dutch Shell all shed between 2% and 5.6%. Mining stocks such as Anglo American and BHP Billiton fell between 4% and 6%.</p>",
  "<p>Children start their new schools this week for the 12th year under Labour. Who could have predicted that more pupils than ever will be going to religious schools this term, as the churches boasted gleefully? Pews empty but faith schools multiply.</p> <p>There are about 14,000 non-religious schools, and nearly 7,000 faith schools. This year the figure has risen again as new academies open: a third are faith-run - and religions have taken over some community schools. Next year 13 more new faith schools open, mostly Christian with three Muslim. This risks being among the most indelibly damaging of Tony Blair's social legacies, his permanent bequest to his own beliefs.</p> <p>Yesterday a new campaign was launched to oppose segregating children by faith. The Accord coalition brings together surprisingly disparate interests, with some teaching unions, the British Humanist Association (of which I am president) and Ekklesia, the Christian theological thinktank. No sooner was the new group made public than its chair, Rabbi Jonathan Romain, minister of Maidenhead synagogue, paid for his outspoken bravery with a savage personal assault from the Jewish Chronicle. Ekklesia can expect similar fury from Christian denominations. Meanwhile secularists are suffering a backlash from the faiths, as if books by Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens and AC Grayling were any match for the mysterious bully power that religions hold over government.</p> <p>Accord wants faith schools to abide by the same admissions criteria as other state schools, with no selection by belief. Teachers should be employed for their skills, not for their faith. It opposes Labour's new rules for faith schools, which came into law yesterday, allowing them to keep all jobs for the faithful. Teaching assistants, dinner ladies and caretakers may need to get on their knees to keep their jobs from now on. </p> <p>Official policy says it's up to local communities to decide the kind of schools they want. In practice, the academy programme encourages widespread faith takeovers, though in future they must offer half their places to outsiders. Years of Labour handwringing over community cohesion hardly squares with dividing children by religion. Ask why and here's the doublethink answer: religious academies now have a \"duty to promote community cohesion\".</p> <p>Look no further than evidence from Northern Ireland to see how much worse divisions grow when 95% of children meet no one from outside their sectarian schools. There, a majority tell pollsters they would prefer mixed schools, but politicians ignore it. A Guardian/ICM poll showed 64% across Britain oppose religious schools - which is also ignored. Odd that Christian and Muslim schools are on the increase just as we are warned that faith wars are now so much more threatening than either the cold war or IRA bombs that habeas corpus must be suspended for 42 days. </p> <p>David Blunkett once said he wanted to \"bottle the magic\" of Christian schools, but their mystery is often their social class. Anxious parents who get on their knees to get a church school place are not to blame. If prayer is what the government demands to win a place in its more selective state schools, that's what parents must do. These schools would be near empty if they admitted only genuine believers.</p> <p>Research from the London School of Economics tells the story. In the capital, where admissions are most fraught, faith school pupils are \"significantly more affluent\" than average for their area. Only 17% of faith pupils are eligible for free school meals, compared with 25% in non-religious schools. Faith schools take fewer than a fifth of lowest ability children, compared with a third across London - and they take many more high achievers. Only 1% of Pakistani or Bangladeshi children are in faith schools, though they often need most help. In Muslim schools, the numbers go into equally damaging social reverse: 34% are on free school meals. </p> <p>Yesterday the schools adjudicator, Philip Hunter, handed in his report on admissions: soon we shall see if faith schools breach the admissions code. A furore followed Ed Balls' revelation that in three sample areas, faith schools illegally interviewed parents, demanded extra fees and asked questions about social background. Just a little screening can make a big difference to a school's \"ethos\" if it deposits difficult families in next-door schools. This matters because the OECD finds the countries with schools that segregate least according to class and ability do best overall: Britain lags behind partly because of its many forms of segregation. </p> <p>Brighton this year has shown what can be done. Appeals by parents over admissions rose this year nationally but the proportion fell in Brighton, due to its first year of a lottery for oversubscribed schools. It was devised by the previous Labour council and supported by the present Conservatives. Eight secondaries were grouped together and where there was oversubscription names were picked from a hat. The result was that free-school-meals children are becoming more evenly spread. Knowing that abilities and social classes are a bit more fairly mixed than before has benefited everyone. Sadly however, the one Catholic school could not be included.</p> <p>Class, ethnic and faith segregation are the most damaging reasons why the Accord coalition needs to prevail. But consider too the craziness of creationism now taught in many more schools than before. Homophobic bullying is worse in faith schools - hardly surprising since most sects preach that gay sex is sin, in Islam one punishable by death. Stonewall found 23% fewer gay pupils able to tell anyone about their sexuality, and least sex education in faith schools. All religions were founded on women's inferiority. In Islam what women wear is a battle-flag of identity, in Catholicism governing women's fertility is the die-in-the-ditch issue. The state can't protect children from pernicious views and doctrines at home - but it has a duty to protect them in state schools. </p> <p>More religious schools open this week, more still next year, all covertly. Labour MPs were never told a third of academies would be faith-run. Yet again, we who were deceived by those who said Gordon Brown would do things differently, were wrong. He may not have Blair's God in his ear, but on every issue his impulse is to pay any price to avoid a fight with any powerful interest group. Result? Loss of respect from just about everyone.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The last of the paper cups had scarcely been swept up after the Democratic convention when American liberals got the bad news. While they had been celebrating Barack Obama's steamroller ride to the Democratic nomination their candidate's lead over his Republican rival had evaporated, leaving John McCain five points ahead in Reuters/Zogby polls. </p> <p>Meanwhile McCain's popularity in the red-state heartland took another jump with his selection of the moose-shooting ex-beauty queen, Alaskan governor Sarah Palin, as his vice-presidential running mate. The war hero and gun advocate \"hockey mom\" are obviously reaching American heartlanders: at some point the left is going to have to learn to reach the same people, especially in the swing states. And to do that they are going to have to learn to speak redneck. </p> <p>A third of Americans live in the geographic \"redneck\" south and more than 50% in the cultural south - in places with white southern Scots-Irish values such as western Pennsylvania, central Missouri and southern Illinois, eastern Connecticut, northern New Hampshire, and others never seen as southern. When you look at people in what has come to be called the red-state heartland, most of their values are traditional white Scots-Irish values.</p> <p>They hold the key to any national election, yet the liberal and alternative media never speak to, or for, them. Progressives dominate the internet, politically speaking, but use it to talk to one another in a closed, politically correct conversation that by definition excludes others, particularly rednecks. I had an editor once, an old-school shot-and-a-beer newsman, who told me: \"Joe, don't become a stenographer for the powerful, regardless of their politics or party.\" I still believe that. It's humanity and a nation we're obligated to, not political junkyism or political correctness.</p> <p>Especially political correctness that excludes millions who do not see the world in terms of social politics. For instance, if I say on National Public Radio that \"rednecks don't vote in their own interests because they are misled by the gun lobby\", liberal middle-class America agrees with me. Proof is in the sales of my book. It's been normal practice so long that we rednecks are immune to it, and have come to take a certain defiant pride in the label. </p> <p>I am an Appalachian native who grew up dirt-eating poor. Yet I have managed to live a couple of decades in the middle class as a news reporter, magazine editor and publishing executive. I know the liberal middle class is condescending to working-class redneck culture - which is insulting, but not a crime. The real crime is the way corporate conservatives lie to my people, screw us blind, kill us in wars and keep us in economic serfdom.</p> <p>The good news is that many lower working-class people are starting to figure that out. If we bothered to cover redneck culture we'd be surprised to find how many progressive rednecks, what I call leftnecks, are out there. America's media caste, however, is put off by the way these folks look and sound, and by their unpredictable opinions. It's happy to deal with the rural red-state working class as long as it remains out there somewhere in \"the heartland\", a place to be polled and surveyed by Gallup to fuel self-absorbed political punditry. </p> <p>Those in the media are granted entitlement to be the one voice, defining America to the many. And they keep that entitlement as long as they maintain false objectivity and keep working-class people politically in the dark. That is not difficult. Every daily newspaper has a business section, but none has a labour section. My European friends, this is no accident.

  "<p>When photographer Laura Peters talks about the \"death industry\", she doesn't mean to sound morbid or macabre. On the contrary, she holds those who staff our mortuaries, funeral parlours and crematoria with respect, having closely observed them at work through the lens of her camera. Her exhibition, Behind the Last Closed Door, opens at Wolverhampton's Lighthouse Gallery this week, offering a glimpse into what lies just beyond when we \"shuffle off this mortal coil\".<br> It seems an odd subject in a society where increasing life expectancy and decreasing religious faith have made many of us value the here and now rather than contemplate a remote and uncertain eternity. \"A century ago it would have been very different,\" she muses. \"Death was part of life and had to be confronted.\"</p> <p>Peters, 24, has had to confront it herself. For five years, she was the registered carer for her grandmother. Having begun training as a nurse before switching to photography at Birmingham City University, she had no qualms about laying out the body and washing it. What she found more difficult was to assuage the grief that she felt for a woman 60 years her senior. \"Doing this project helped,\" she says. \"I found it therapeutic to go back to the sort of places where her body had gone to.\" </p> <p>The last that most of us see of our nearest and dearest is the coffin sliding slowly along the crematorium plinth. But Peters' pictures also take us behind the plush curtains to see what it's like on the other side of that conveyor belt of bodily remains. In a little room to the right is what looks suspiciously like a CCTV screen. Surely the camera's not trained on the congregation?</p> <p>\"No, only on the pulpit, so that the person in the control room knows when to start the music,\" Peters confirms. Her own camera has also delved into what's left when the ashes finally cool \u2013 here a slightly rusting prosthetic hip, there a Sikh ceremonial dagger. \"The Co-op has a whole section for Sikh and Muslim funerals,\" she says. Indeed one of her pictures shows a Hessian sack being sewn up to meet the wishes of a deceased Muslim that his remains should be sent back to Pakistan.</p> <p>\"No matter how many bodies they deal with, undertakers always show respect, blending into the background at funerals,\" Peters maintains. As if to emphasise their lack of obtrusiveness, one of her shots is of two almost ghostly figures reflected in the gleaming rear window of a hearse \u2013 almost the last closed door. <br> \u0095 Behind the Last Closed Door is at the Lighthouse Gallery, Wolverhampton, until September 18</p>",

  "<p>It's over a year away, but with the new term starting, now's the time to get everything in gear for completing that 2009 university application. It may feel it's far too early to be bothering with this, but the truth is that an early application can reap the desired reward. And Ucas is already accepting applications for 2009 entry. </p> <p>Choice of course and university are the most important considerations. But one thing that is guaranteed to cause much angst is the dreaded personal statement. It's very easy for both the student and their teacher/adviser to become obsessed with it. </p> <p>First, what exactly is it? It's a blank space that allows you to do a serious bit of personal marketing - your chance to persuade a university admissions tutor that you are a suitable, committed, informed and motivated student. You have somewhere between 500 and 600 words usually. Put simply: justify why you want to study this particular subject. Remember two things here: one, it's quite likely that you won't be interviewed, and two, each of your five choices sees the same personal statement. So it's best to take it seriously. </p> <p>What to include? Three main areas: </p> <p><strong>1. </strong>Explain your interest in your chosen course especially if it's a new discipline for you. Show you've done your research. This could take up to half of the whole statement. </p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Present evidence to show you are a keen and well motivated student now. </p> <p><strong>3. </strong>Portray you - the whole applicant. This can include your outside interests and longer-term career aims, as well as things from outside your studies demonstrating what makes you tick. Also bring in university visits/conferences/summer schools as well as part-time/voluntary work experience, gap-year plans if relevant and any other background facts that make you unique. </p> <p>But how to start? First, make a list of things to include, then develop these into sentences using the above structure. There is no right and wrong way of doing this, but material from all three areas should be in there. The whole thing should flow but it will take several drafts before you get there. </p> <p>What part does the personal statement play in the admissions process? This is a moot point. If you are applying for a vocational degree (say, medicine or architecture), there's a good chance it will be looked at. Likewise if it's a very popular course such as law. However, for many courses it will not play a crucial role. Your academic profile will almost certainly be scrutinised initially. </p> <p>Ten dos and don'ts: </p> <p><strong>1.</strong> Be truthful and accurate. </p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Don't underestimate your achievements. </p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Construct as a word document, spell check and save before cutting and pasting onto the online form. </p> <p><strong>4.</strong> Get guidance and advice. </p> <p><strong>5.</strong> Avoid \"I like reading\", \"I like socialising\" - everyone does.<br> <strong>6.</strong> Don't plagiarise - Ucas can and will suss you out and inform the unis. </p> <p><strong>7. </strong>No waffling. </p> <p><strong>8.</strong> No text speak or colloquialisms. </p> <p><strong>9.</strong> Avoid repetition. </p> <p><strong>10. </strong>Be positive. </p> <p>One final point: probably 90% of all personal statements are solid and conventional but lack that spark of uniqueness and individuality. Something eye-catching but not off-putting or controversial can be a definite plus. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> John Beckett is a higher education adviser at City &amp; Islington Sixth-Form College</p>",

The Victoria County History series, launched in 1899, aims to provide a detailed general and topographical account of each English county. </p> <p>Ray's attitude to work and morality was influenced by his nonconformist background. Born in Highbridge, Somerset, he was the son of a Methodist minister; after his mother's death, when he was six, his father married again - to the daughter of another Methodist minister, at least three of whose descendants also became Methodist ministers. Ray won a scholarship to study history at Merton College, Oxford, in 1939, but volunteered for the RAF before completing the course. Until demobilisation he served as a radar operator and instructor in Britain, west Africa, Belgium and Germany. After resuming his studies and graduating, he obtained a post as an assistant editor of the Victoria County History series, then being revived with local authority finance.</p> <p>Ray initially worked on Wiltshire, but when the Essex committee was established in 1951 he was appointed as its editor. The Essex files, containing slips in parish envelopes, had been stored in the basement of the National Central Library (now part of the British Library), which had been bombed during the war. To separate them from the records of other counties and cope with the problems of dust, leaking pipes and inadequate lighting was no easy task. However, the Essex Record Office was already collecting a steady flow of previously unseen documents, which provided an abundance of new information.</p> <p>Ray now planned a series of new volumes, and recruited the help of Essex Record Office employees, local historians and committed volunteers to produce them. Vol IV, on the Ongar Hundred, appeared in 1956, the first bibliography in 1959, and Vol III, on Roman Essex, in 1963. Volumes covering metropolitan Essex, including West Ham, East Ham, Barking and Dagenham, Walthamstow, Leyton, Chingford and Ilford followed. Havering (including Romford), Epping, and Harlow and District, came next. A second bibliography volume appeared in 1987, just after Ray retired. </p> <p>Over the next 22 years, he produced an authoritative biography of the brilliant but quarrelsome Essex historian John Horace Round, a series of other studies, and a total of 53 articles. He also produced a number of short books, including Keir Hardie in West Ham, and wrote for the Essex Journal, the English Historical Review, the Pipe Roll Series, Archives, the Antiquaries Journal, as well as the Transactions of the Essex Society for Archaeology &amp; History.</p> <p>A fellow of the Royal Historical Society, he served as president and in other capacities in the Essex Society for Archaeology &amp; History. He was also a very active secretary of the Essex branch of the Historical Association.</p> <p>He married Avril Johnson in 1942 and she survives him. A scholar in her own right, she worked with him on several projects, including a second edition of A Medieval Farming Glossary of Latin and English Words. He is also survived by three children and six grandchildren.</p>",
  "<p>When some people want to raise money for a worthy cause, they might call in some donations from their friends to be sold at a jumble sale and hope to raise, at most, \u00a3100 or so. When you're Sadie Frost and known more for your famous friends than anything else, you can probably count on a bit more. </p> <p>Yesterday, Frost launched a silent auction on the Selfridges website to raise money for Breast Cancer Care. After flicking through her address book, Frost called in donations from her closest friends, including a pair of Christian Louboutin stilettos from and signed by her best friend, Kate Moss; the Martin Margiela suit worn by Frost's ex-husband, Jude Law, in the film Alfie; a signed guitar from Liam Gallagher; and a drawing by Jake Chapman entitled, with just a touch of sarcasm, Another Nice Etching from Jake and Dinos Chapman. In short, a little more impressive than some handmade jumpers and a tray of jam tarts. The auction will run until September 25 and all the items can be viewed in the Oxford Street store in London. </p> <p>Breast cancer is the second biggest cause of death for women in the UK, trumped only by lung cancer. Approximately 44,600 are diagnosed with breast cancer each year. Frost said that she and her sisters decided to organise a charity auction after their aunt was diagnosed with the disease. She said she was \"thrilled\" by the generosity of her friends. Christine Watts, of Selfridges, said she was \"so pleased to be working with Sadie on this unique collaboration. We hope customers will enjoy bidding for the chance to own iconic pieces.\"</p>",
  "<p>GDF Suez, the new French energy group, yesterday posted a 20% leap in first-half earnings as it reaffirmed it had no interest in buying British Energy, the UK's main nuclear power operator.</p> <p>G\u00e9rard Mestrallet, the chief executive, did, however, confirm that GDF Suez was keen to be a player in Britain's nuclear energy market, where the government is courting French rival EDF to buy British Energy.</p> <p>Announcing first-half results in Paris, Mestrallet said pre-tax profits rose to \u20ac8.1bn (\u00a36.5bn) on sales up 17% to \u20ac43bn on the back of soaring demand and high prices.</p> <p>The group was forged in late July from the \u20ac93bn merger of state-owned gas company GDF with Franco-Belgian utility Suez and reasserted its target of 10% annual earnings growth to \u20ac17bn by 2010.</p> <p>Mestrallet said the group aimed to invest \u20ac30bn by the end of 2010 and to achieve annual savings of \u20ac1bn by 2013, and help lift GDF Suez shares.</p> <p>The new cash-rich group said it would pay its first interim dividend of 80 cents or \u20ac1.7bn in late November and aims to increase the annual pay-out by up to 15% a year by 2010 when it would reach more than half of net income. </p> <p>It announced a \u20ac1bn share buy-back before the end of 2008.</p> <p>GDF Suez, which is building a 1.9 gigawatt power station on Teesside, has made plain it wants to operate at least two of the new-generation nuclear power plants planned by the UK government. It already operates seven nuclear stations in Belgium, where it is the biggest energy supplier, trading as Electrabel, and recently sold off a 25.1% stake in Belgian supplier SPE to Centrica, the owner of British Gas. Centrica is still a potential partner of EDF and/or GDF Suez in the UK's new nuclear power programme and now has majority control of SPE.</p> <p>The French group, which has 11% of its power capacity in nuclear, has also signalled it could take part in building the second new-generation EPR reactor planned by President Nicolas Sarkozy. It is also investing heavily in renewable energy, including wind and hydro.</p> <p>But Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cirelli, deputy chief executive and former head of GDF, said a government cap on gas prices had cost it almost \u20ac180m in the first half and more than \u20ac1bn since 2004.</p> <p>He insisted that the group was not experiencing gas supply problems with Russia despite the country's exacerbated political tensions with the EU. Shares in the group bucked the falling trend on France's main market, rising about 2%.</p>",

  "<p>European leaders launched a \"crucial\" mission last night to mediate with the Kremlin over the Caucasus crisis, saying that relations between the EU and Russia were at a crossroads and freezing talks on a strategic pact with Russia until Moscow observes the terms of a ceasefire in Georgia agreed three weeks ago.</p> <p>An emergency summit of 27 EU leaders in Brussels delivered a strong signal of support for Georgia and demanded that no country follows Russia in recognising the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. \"That decision is unacceptable,\" the leaders said and condemned Russia for failing to keep promises it made when signing the French-brokered ceasefire.</p> <p>Nicolas Sarkozy, the French and current EU president who convened the summit, said Moscow's relations with the west were at stake in the Caucasus and that he would go to Moscow next week, along with the European commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, and the EU foreign policy head, Javier Solana, to mediate over Georgia but also to gauge Russia's commitment to a values-based relationship with Europe.</p> <p>\"The question is what does Russia want,\" Sarkozy said of the Kremlin's decision to invade and partition Georgia. \"It takes two to tango. The meeting [in Moscow] on September 8 will be crucial for relations between Russia and the EU.\"</p> <p>The summit called on Russia \"not to isolate itself\" and shelved negotiations, scheduled for a fortnight's time, on the new strategic partnership unless Moscow pulls back its forces in Georgia to pre-conflict positions.</p> <p>\"Relations between the EU and Russia have reached a crossroads,\" a summit statement said last night, announcing that \"the various aspects of EU-Russia relations\" would be subjected to \"a careful in-depth examination\" during an EU-Russia summit scheduled in November.</p> <p>Gordon Brown had insisted on the suspension of negotiations on the accord with Moscow but that was resisted by some EU governments who cautioned against \"the situation spiralling out of control\", according to a European diplomat.</p> <p>However, Germany, the Scandinavian countries and the central Europeans backed Britain's demand. Brown also successfully lobbied for the summit statement to pledge Europe to reducing its dependence on Russian energy supplies.</p> <p>The meeting condemned Russia's redrawing of Georgia's borders and said Georgia was entitled to resist Russian pressure and to freely determine which \"alliances\" to join.</p> <p>\"We cannot go back to the age of spheres of influence. Yalta is dead,\" said Sarkozy of the 1945 agreement between the victors of the second world war.</p> <p>\"Russia has shown its true face,\" said one EU foreign minister. \"The problem for us is how are we going to respond.\"</p> <p>The EU is reluctant to punish the world's biggest energy supplier at a time of record prices. But the leaders agreed to send dozens of EU military ceasefire monitors to Georgia. EU leaders had previously floated the idea of European armed peacekeepers but that option was ditched.</p> <p>The decision to freeze the strategic partnership negotiations provoked an angry Russian response. \"Any attempt to punish another country is counter-productive or illegal. We need to resolve our problems in a civilised way, through dialogue,\" said Andrei Nesterenko, Russia's foreign ministry spokesman. The move could also be seen as counter-productive since the EU is keener than Russia on the new pact. The negotiations had been frozen for almost two years on the European side until July, with Poland and Lithuania vetoing talks.</p>",
  "<p>First day at school. Stomach sinks. Tears well up. Bottom lip trembles - and you're just the parent. First-time parents get more anxious than their little darlings, so let's spare a thought for them and those others new to school this week - the newly qualified teachers.</p> <p>As with every \"ordeal\", the waiting is worse. Parents, awake since 6am, look with adoration and apprehension at little darling's new clothes and shiny shoes laid out ready. </p> <p>Meanwhile, new teacher, shiny of shoe, has been in the school car park since 6am and is desperate for the loo, but the school is not open yet. Among the bewildering plethora of educational acronyms, will she know her ARs from her EWO (annual reviews and educational welfare officer).</p> <p>Little darling, hair brushed and looking too angelic for school, sits down to a bowl of his favourite Wheatyoatypoppypuffybangs. Parent too anxious to eat.</p> <p>In the staff room, new teacher inadvertently uses Miss Bagshott's cherished George Michael mug. Other staff are wide-eyed at this transgression. Miss Bagshott explains with curled lip that she only ever imbibes summer hedgerow infusion (decaf) and will have to have the mug reglazed so as not to taste any of your nasty Nescafe. </p> <p>Breakfast is a must for new teachers and pupils alike. The first few weeks are very tiring and you need fuel. The school will have induction programmes for NQTs and new children designed to ensure a smooth and successful start. New teacher will also have an experienced member of staff as induction tutor. Be aware of staffroom foibles and inform your induction tutor of any difficulties with colleagues. </p> <h2>Panic sets in</h2> <p>New teacher smiles bravely to mask the panic as 30 children breeze in. Can I do this? How will I learn their names?</p> <p>Yes, you can. In today's competitive climate, you would not have been employed otherwise. Smiling is a great way to welcome your class. You will get to know their names much more quickly than the adults with whom you work, though it's not a good idea still to address the head as \"mate\" after a couple of weeks.</p> <p>The little darlings arrive and are shown their name and shiny picture on their coat hooks. First-time parents' major worry is that little darling will be too distraught to leave them.</p> <p>With lots of pre-visits to school, careful induction and regular communication, schools generally avoid such scenarios, but occasionally a child will pick up on parents' anxiety and become a limpet. In severe cases, the teacher will gently peel him off your leg, and you need to exit, quick. Even while you are blubbering distraught at the gates, he is already happily finger painting and wondering whether red or yellow will look most dashing smeared on his new blue top. For major hysterics - heaving sobs, which convince anxious parent that airway collapse is imminent - most schools will ring or text you to let you know all is calm. </p> <p>Some parents can find it hard if their child settles quickly - running into school without even saying goodbye.</p> <p>Parents worry their child will get told off. New teachers worry if they'll ever be able to control up to 30 children. Children quickly learn what is acceptable, and positive behaviour is rewarded. Schools will work closely with parents. New teachers - follow the school guidelines and set a firm, fair and consistent pattern from the off. If lessons are interesting, the children won't want to misbehave.</p> <p>Parents get anxious about sport. They recall from their own school days a psychopathic bully employed as PE teacher to take out their anger on children. Rest assured, in 2008 that's no longer the case. Those are secondary school PE teachers. </p> <p>There is a particular group of pupils who find it hard to get changed for PE. In education we refer to them as \"boys\". They are the ones who just stand looking at their clothes with their arms out waiting for someone to dress them. The first few sessions of PE are spent on which clothes to take off (and which to leave on). </p> <h2>New friends</h2> <p>What if my child doesn't make friends? Much of the first few weeks in foundation stage are about learning to share, cooperate and collaborate with others. This is much the same for new teachers, who need to get the most from colleagues' experience but also pace themselves and try to hold on to a work-life balance. Things do get easier after the first year. Playgrounds can be noisy, crowded and intimidating, but teachers will organise things so every new child has someone to play with. Don't let your heart skip a beat every time you hear an ambulance siren - your child is safe.</p> <p>Some children find lunchtimes hard. Some are very slow eaters, some are fussy eaters and some are just so sociable they are too distracted to eat. Dinner ladies will let teacher know if a child isn't eating. </p> <p>New teacher has palled up with a colleague and ordered school dinners hoping for a Jamie Oliver classic, but gets pizza and wedges. </p> <p>Some children have idiosyncratic toilet habits. Part of the problem lies in expectations. Gervaise Phinn, author and educationist, tells of a new boy at school who turns up at the staffroom, trousers round ankles, to enquire belligerently, \"Oo wipes the arses round 'ere?\" The answer is \"Not us.\" School supervises the first few visits to ensure all is well and will have spare clothes in case of accidents.</p> <p>Some children refuse to go home. We always have someone who just wants to stay at school and mum ends up coming in red-faced to try to remove them. Look on the bright side - your child is a natural academic!</p> <p>Children will find lots about school easy. They will make new friends, join in with new activities and enjoy talking about home and anything else that is important to them. Most of all, they will love asking questions and will be excited and enthusiastic about anything and everything. Which is great news for new teacher, who will also gain valued new friends - workload notwithstanding, teachers know how to party.</p> <p>Finally, as a first-time parent, when you've stopped straining to hear ambulance sirens and filling the bin with tear-stained tissues, think of how you can enjoy filling your new spare time. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Kevin Harcombe is headteacher of Redlands primary school, Fareham</p>",
  "<p>Who would have thought that Dame Helen Mirren would have such confusing views? In a surprisingly frank interview with GQ magazine, she said she had been date-raped a \"couple of times\". How would the harsh Justice of Helen deal with these offences? According to Mirren, if you end up in bed with a man, and then say \"no\" to full sex, but are forced into it anyway, then yes, that is rape (cheers, sister). However, she added that \"I don't think she can have that man into court under those circumstances. I guess it is one of the many subtle parts of the men-women relationship that has to be negotiated and worked out between them.\" </p> <p>Just out of interest, in case I ever become Sex Ombudsman, how exactly do you get yourself unraped, through negotiation?</p> <p>But let's not mire ourselves in that, when there's worse to come: \"It's such a tricky area, isn't it? Especially if there's no violence. I mean, look at Mike Tyson. I don't think he was a rapist.\"</p> <p>To recap on the Tyson case: in 1992, he was indicted for the rape of Desiree Washington. Of course it was Washington's word against Tyson's, but corroborative evidence includes the hospital emergency room doctor who examined Washington and found \"abrasions consistent with forced or very hard intercourse\", and the chauffeur who saw Washington directly after the violation \"dazed, disoriented ... scared\" and \"in a state of shock\". </p> <p>One of the key points of Tyson's defence and attempted appeal was that he didn't use a weapon. (Washington, incidentally, weighed 7st. But of course, if she were a bona fide rape victim, she should have been able to fight a gunless Tyson off with thumbs and panache.) It is true that Washington suffered no other serious physical injuries, but if we require women to be beaten to a pulp before a rape conviction can be upheld, why even bother having a law against rape? Why not just file it all under GBH?</p> <p>Tyson, incidentally, emerged from the three years served of his six-year sentence having converted to Islam, and yet was not so filled with the spirit of Godly peace that he didn't say this: \"I just hate her guts. She put me in that state where, I don't know, I really wish I did now. Now I really do want to rape her.\" </p> <p>Subtle? Negotiated? Between a man and a woman? Come on. Mirren's views are not controversial, they are senseless.</p>",
  "<p><strong>March 2008</strong> \"Does the defence wish to say anything, Mr Mason?\" the judge asked.</p> <p>\"Only that Julian Trent is a nasty piece of work and I was only defending him because I had to,\" I replied. \"I would much rather have been riding my horse at Cheltenham.\"</p> <p>\"Quite so. I'm sending you to prison for eight years, Mr Trent.\"</p> <p>Little did I realise I would be seeing a great deal more of him much sooner than that. Though every reader did, given the utter predictability of this formula intro.</p> <p><strong>November 2008</strong> My father had wanted me to follow him into the family law firm as a country solicitor, but I had always resisted. \"What schmuck wants to take on his dad's franchise?\" I had told him. \"Next you'll be suggesting I write thrillers.\"</p> <p>I had fallen in love with steeplechasing as a teenager (cut and paste in \"the thrill of half a tonne of animal thundering along at 30mph\" from dad's 43 other books) and I had tried to make a career as a jockey. But I was too clever for that, so I decided to become a barrister after someone pointed out that jockeys wore silk and barristers took silk so they were quite similar really.</p> <p>My father had also told me it was important that an action hero should be single at the beginning of a book in order to allow for some love interest, so my wife had conveniently died seven and a half years ago (tell them she was eight months pregnant at the time, it adds pathos - Dad, x) and I didn't have any thoughts of romance. Honestly! Though you couldn't have blamed me if I had.</p> <p>The phone rang. It was top jockey, Steve Mitchell. \"I've been accused of killing top jockey, Scot Barlow, by sticking some of my betting slips on to a pitchfork to show everyone it was me and then stabbing him with it,\" he said. \"Will you defend me?\"</p> <p>\"Have you heard that Julian Trent has been let out?\" my clerk said. \"He intimidated three jurors and got them to change their mind about the verdict.\"</p> <p>\"That's ridiculous,\" I laughed. \"Even a moron would find that totally implausible.\"</p> <p>\"Well it's true,\" Trent snarled, beating me with a baseball bat. \"And you'd better make sure Mitchell goes down. Or I'll kill your dad. And your girlfriend when you get one.\"</p> <p>Why didn't I realise there were already too many coincidences? Why didn't I tell the police? Or just give up and tell the publishers this was going nowhere?</p> <p>\"Everyone thinks I'm guilty,\" Mitchell said, \"and I did have a chequered past with Barlow, what with the betting and me having an affair with his sister and her committing suicide. But I never killed him.\"</p> <p>\"I know,\" I replied, \"because I'm the only person who has noticed that a photograph of Barlow's sister with Peninsula, the Derby winner, as a foal has gone missing.\"</p> <p>\"Hello,\" said Eleanor the vet. </p> <p>\"You must be my future girlfriend.\"</p> <p>\"Yes. But let's take things slow for a few chapters. Why don't you keep your regulars happy by getting in some riding action first? You could be brought down by another horse when you were winning and be an injured hero. Then we could shag.\"</p> <p><strong>May 2009</strong> \"You'd better make sure Mitchell goes down,\" Trent snarled. I'd had enough of him threatening little people like the jurors. It was time to give them back their self-respect and remember Magna Carta.</p> <p>\"The defence is calling Roger Radcliffe, Peninsula's owner,\" I said. \"Radcliffe, I accuse you of being Julian Trent's godfather and killing both Barlow and Barlow's sister because they were blackmailing you as they knew Peninsula was really a four-year-old when he won the Derby and therefore shouldn't have been allowed to enter the race.\"</p> <p>\"Damn you, Mason,\" said Radcliffe.</p> <p>\"This is getting more absurd by the minute,\" said the judge. \"Book dismissed.\"</p> <p>\"My hero,\" Eleanor sighed.</p> <p>\"Just hang on a tick while I tie up the loose ends by coshing Trent to death and I'll be with you.\"</p> <p><strong>The digested read, digested: </strong>Synthetic silks.</p>",
  "<h2>The religious right</h2> <p>John McCain has taken a lot of heat for naming Sarah Palin as his running mate - having met her only once - but with one core Republican constituency, previously tepid if not outright hostile to McCain, the move has proved to be inspired. America's Christian conservatives instantly fell in love with her. </p> <p>Until last week, they were holding back their volunteer hours - and their money - from the McCain campaign. Many on the Christian right had never forgiven the candidate for a speech during his 2000 presidential run, in which he denounced some evangelical leaders as \"agents of intolerance\".</p> <p>After that, no matter how solid his anti-abortion position, McCain was never regarded as \"one of us\".</p> <p>That has all changed with his pick of Palin, who is a mission statement of Christian conservativism in human form. She's not just pro-gun, she shoots grizzly bears. She's not just anti-abortion, she has had five children, giving birth to her fifth, who has Down's syndrome, earlier this year. She supports teaching creationism alongside evolution in science classes at state schools.</p> <p>As of Sunday, $7m in donations had flowed into the McCain coffers in the 48 hours since Palin had been named, most of that cash assumed to have come from evangelicals thrilled - and amazed - to find one of their own on the Republican ticket. Some said their prayers had been answered.</p> <p>Rush Limbaugh, the enormously influential conservative talk show host, told <a href=\"http://www.Politico.com\">Politico.com</a> that Palin had electrified the religious right, who were greeting the pick as a \"home f***ing run\". He added in an email, \"Palin = Guns, Babies, Jesus,\" the holy trinity of Republican rightist politics. Limbaugh contrasted Palin's life story with Barack Obama's statement earlier in the year that some poor white voters were \"bitter\" - \"clinging\" to their faith or their guns out of fear. \"Obama just lost blue-collar, white Democratic voters in Pennsylvania and other states,\" predicted Limbaugh.</p> <p>It's worth remembering that the key to George W Bush's victory in 2004, despite a surge in Democratic support, was the mobilisation of the evangelical right. If Palin succeeds in exciting that crucial bloc - getting them to organise and to turn out on November 4 - picking Palin could prove to have been a smarter move by McCain than most have given him credit for. <br><strong>Jonathan Freedland </strong></p> <h2>The hockey moms</h2> <p>She's a mother of five. She's married to a native Yup'ik Inuit. She claims she can balance \"the BlackBerries and the breast pump\". It's fair to say there's never before been a vice-presidential candidate like Sarah Palin, and John McCain must have knelt down and thanked his lucky stars when he found her, along with her recipes for moose stew. </p> <p>But this image of a wholesome, apple pie \"hockey mom\", as she describes herself, crossed with a hearty pioneer, becomes a little cracked on closer inspection. </p> <p>Her husband, Todd, was her high school boyfriend, a four-times champion snow mobiler and a judge in this year's Miss Alaska pageant. He left his job at BP Oil earlier this year after his wife was elected governor of the state last year to avoid accusations of conflict of loyalties, but quickly returned, saying his family \"needed the money\". </p> <p>Family loyalty has caused Palin other troubles, too: she is currently facing an investigation for putting improper pressure on a safety commissioner to fire a certain state trooper who just happened to be going through a divorce with Palin's sister. After the Bushes and the Clintons, most Americans are wary of politicians who are accused of using family connections for personal or political gain.</p> <p>Her children have also attracted attention, having already inspired a Facebook group: \"What's your favourite Palin child name?\" appeared on the website mere moments after McCain announced her as his vice-presidential candidate. Trig Paxon Van Palin is currently the front runner, although the others - Track (named in honour of her mother's love of track and field events), Bristol, Willow and Piper - give it a good run for its money. In truth, American voters will probably give more attention to the fact that her oldest, Track, is in the army and about to be sent to Iraq, meaning that both Obama and McCain have chosen running mates who will have a child in the armed forces in Iraq (Joe Biden's son, Beau, is going in October).</p> <p>Her most recent pregnancy certainly got the conspiracy theorists going. When Palin told her colleagues she was soon to give birth, some months ago, they were astonished and claimed her bump was \"barely perceptible\". The internet was soon awash with rumours about Trig, now four months old, with many bloggers claiming he is actually her grandson. Yet, to scupper this rumour, Palin yesterday announced that, actually, Bristol, her 17-year-old and unmarried daughter who some suggested was Trig's mother, is five months pregnant. This means that, yes, she can't be Trig's real mother, but this will hardly be a preferable state of affairs to rightwing Republican voters. The timing is even worse as Bristol will be about to give birth when voters go to the polling station, come November.</p> <p>Ultimately, Palin comes across like a composite of various American TV characters: Bree, the uptight woman in Desperate Housewives who adopts her daughter's baby, crossed with a rootin' shootin' type from Northern Exposure - which might not be quite the everywoman image the Republican party is hoping for. <br><strong>Hadley Freeman </strong></p> <h2>Feminists</h2> <p>Take a partial view of Sarah Palin - one that omits the trifling detail of her policies and beliefs - and there is much that might appeal to feminists. Her physical strength, for instance. Speaking to Time earlier this year she said that she grew up in \"a family where gender wasn't going to be an issue ... You're out there hunting and fishing ... I knew that as a woman I could do whatever the men were doing\"; in high school she won the nickname \"Sarah Barracuda\" for her tenacity on the basketball court; more recently she has run a marathon.</p> <p>And she isn't just physically tough. Palin's rise to become the first female governor of Alaska - a feminist milestone in itself - involved taking on the state party and unseating the Republican incumbent. Then there's the way that she juggles her family life and career. While many staunchly Republican mothers of five might be expected to stay at home while their kids are growing up - and to preach this as the only acceptable option - Palin offers up a very different model. Her husband took time off to be a stay-at-home father, while she returned to work three days after having her fifth child. Not everyone will envy or even admire this, but plenty of women will empathise with someone who has a tonne on her plate and is tackling it head-on. As one of only two women who has ever run on the Republican or Democrat ticket for the US presidency, Palin should be an incredibly potent feminist symbol.</p> <p>She even calls herself a feminist - why wouldn't feminists support her? The problem is that Palin's version of feminism isn't one that many people would recognise. Most notably, she is a member of the anti-abortion organisation Feminists for Life and is so fervently against a woman's right to choose that, as Kim Gandy, president of the National Organisation for Women (the biggest feminist group in the US) has pointed out \"in a gubernatorial debate, Palin stated emphatically ... that even if her teenage daughter was impregnated by a rapist, she would 'choose life' - meaning apparently that she would not permit her daughter to have an abortion.\" Such views, says feminist writer Jessica Valenti, make Palin \"a terrible choice for women. I don't really know what argument one could make that she's good for women - unless you think that having any woman candidate is good for us.\"</p> <p>\"The sad fact,\" Valenti continues, \"is that when it comes to the Republicans, the women who tend to get access to power are explicitly anti-feminist, and anti-women, because it's the only way that they're able to rise through the ranks. The party is strategically coughing up women who won't rock the boat, who won't rock male structures of power.\"</p> <p>Many feminists agree that Palin's appointment seems cynical - an attempt to win both the women's vote and the extreme rightwing vote by opting for a vice-presidential candidate who offers up the most ugly, antiquated Republican views in a glossy, young, female package. Thankfully, women don't seem to be falling for it - the first polls after McCain announced his pick showed that Palin was being received much more enthusiastically by men than by women - with more than half of all those women surveyed saying that she was unqualified to be president.</p> <p>As Margaret Thatcher taught British feminists, for all the positive symbolism that accompanies a woman crashing through the glass ceiling, it's all for nought if said woman isn't actually on our side. <br><strong>Kira Cochrane </strong></p> <h2>Republican women</h2> <p>Kay Bailey Hutchinson, the most senior Republican woman in the Senate, an authority on foreign policy, and an ordinarily serene and composed television prescence, was actually flustered. Asked what she thought of McCain's pick of Palin as his running mate, Hutchinston stuttered a bit. \"Well, it certainly ... it is bold,\" she settled on after a lengthy pause. \"It is a breath of fresh air. It is going to take everyone by surprise,\" she told MSNBC. </p> <p>Was Palin ready to step in as commander-in-chief, Hutchinson was asked. Hutchinson dodged: \"I think the fact that she was outside the Beltway [America's political centre] had to have been a decisive factor for John McCain.\" Hutchinson's obvious discomfort was in part a product of the fact that she, like so many Republicans, does not know Palin - and the Alaskan politician had not widely been considered in the running as a potential vice-president. </p> <p>That list of women McCain could have chosen was well established. It was headed by Condoleezza Rice, the secretary of state - although she was earlier rumoured to have been considering a run for the White House herself. But Rice took herself out of the running last April. Then there were McCain's main economic advisers: the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, Carly Fiorna, who has been a constant presence on television during his campaign and the founder of eBay, Meg Whitman. Among Republican women in the Senate, Hutchinson and Olympia Snowe were seen as the most likely contenders. The White House Project, which supports women in politics, put both senators on its shortlist of potential presidential candidates.</p> <p>Hutchinson, 65 and a Texan, is the most senior Republican woman in the Senate. She is a solid conservative, but she supports abortion rights - which would have disqualified her among the evangelicals McCain is trying to win over. Hutchinson is also one of Hillary Clinton's best friends in the Senate. Clinton hosted a baby shower for Hutchinson when she adopted twins. Snowe, 61, who is from Maine, campaigned for McCain in neighbouring New Hampshire. She is one of the most popular figures in the Senate. She is ordinarily hawkish, but not conservative enough for the Republican right. She is a member of Republicans for Choice, which supports abortion rights, and supports stem cell research and gay rights. If there is a backlash among Republican women for choosing Palin over more experienced candidates, it is likely to be offset by the enthusiasm for her candidacy among evangelical voters. <br><strong>Suzanne Goldenberg </strong></p> <h2>Non-Alaskans</h2> <p>To most Americans the strangest thing about Palin is the state she calls home: Alaska. There is a much-viewed YouTube video of Palin handling an automatic rifle during a trip to Kuwait. As Palin looses off a few rounds, a US Army instructor can be heard telling her approvingly: \"You're pretty much hitting it dead centre.\" But her handiness with a gun shouldn't be a surprise - Palin and her father would regularly rise at 3am to go hunting: \"I grew up hunting and fishing in Alaska, and I am proud to raise my children with this same uniquely Alaskan heritage.\"</p> <p>In Alaska, where Palin grew up after her family moved from Idaho, that isn't seen as unusual. And neither is Palin's lifetime membership of the National Rifle Association, the powerful lobby group dedicated to fighting any restrictions on gun ownership.</p> <p>With its population of just 680,000 people living on the fringes of a vast wilderness, Alaska has only a little more than one person for each of its 572,000 square miles. Being separated from the US mainland, it is a place few other Americans ever visit, since it's quicker for those on America's east coast to fly to Europe.</p> <p>As a result, Alaska remains a mysterious place to Palin's compatriots. Most know that the state was bought off Russia in 1867 for $7.2m, regarded at the time as an astounding act of folly. But that was before a barrel of oil cost $100.</p> <p>Now Alaska's livelihood is sustained by oil and natural gas production - and each man, woman and child in Alaska receives an annual cheque from the state's oil royalty dividend. This year, thanks to rising oil prices, each Alaskan will receive close to $3,000 apiece.</p> <p>Naturally, Palin is a vocal supporter of drilling for oil in the protected Alaska National Wildlife Reserve, a cause of controversy inside and outside the state. Many remember that Alaska suffered the huge Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, when the tanker ran aground and released 42m litres of oil that affected 1,300 miles of Alaska's coastline.</p> <p>Palin's nomination is not the only time Alaska has figured in a US presidential election. In 1960 a candidate pledged to visit all 50 states - but his travel to Alaska took up three vital days in a nail-biting campaign. His name was Richard Nixon, and he was beaten by John F Kennedy. Sarah Palin will hope she's a better omen. <br><strong>Richard Adams</strong></p> <h2>The media</h2> <p>There are many things you can say about John McCain but one thing's for sure: the man likes to be around beauty queens. His second wife, Cindy, was the Junior Rodeo Queen of Arizona and now his chosen running mate came second in a Miss Alaska pageant and, allegedly thanks to her flute playing, won Miss Congeniality, a title heretofore associated more with an anodyne Sandra Bullock film than a highly conservative vice-presidential candidate. </p> <p>There is something strikingly familiar about Palin's appearance, but that might just be because, as American political satirist Jon Stewart was quick to point out, she looks oddly, and simultaneously, like American comedian Tina Fey, Will &amp; Grace actor Megan Mullally and a fantasy sexy librarian. </p> <p>She also evokes another comparison that American voters may well find even more comforting. When she stands next to the elder statesman McCain, the two of them look like the conventional newscasting team: the white-haired man and the pretty but sensible (never underestimate the power of a pair of glasses) younger woman. You expect them to start shuffling papers and bantering about the local baseball team any minute. </p> <p>In fact, Palin was a newscaster back in the 80s, with the big hair and earrings to match. And while there is much to snigger over in the YouTube footage of the young Palin reading out basketball scores, it does show that she has spent nearly a lifetime in front of the camera, so although she has not had an enormous amount of political experience, she certainly has media experience and, in today's climate, that might well be just as important. </p> <p>Perhaps even more problematic to the Democrats is Palin herself - the Republicans have managed to find someone with an even more extraordinary story than Obama's. As US comedian Bill Maher put it, \"How can you not love her?\" Well, some might not, but for an election-weary media and, more importantly, public, it's impossible not to be fascinated by her. <br><strong>Hadley Freeman</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 In pictures:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2008/sep/01/republicans2008.palin?picture=337165827\">Sarah Palin: the gun-toting governor</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday September 11 2008.

  "<p>Wayne Mosley, a member of the Georgia delegation to the Republican convention, surveyed the quiet main hall of the Xcel Energy Centre, in downtown St Paul, a few hours before yesterday's much-curtailed order of business began. \"I think we're probably naturally just more subdued people,\" he said. \"That doesn't mean we're any less passionate about our candidate.\"</p> <p>It was hard not to feel that he was putting a brave face on things. By most standards - not just by comparison with the Democratic convention - the auditorium seemed desolate, although it became busier as the day progressed. On the podium from which George Bush and Dick Cheney were no longer to address the audience, a handful of party operatives milled around aimlessly, now and then poking the stage with the toes of their shoes, as if to check its solidity. Behind them, on a huge plasma screen, the stars and stripes flapped silently.</p> <p>Anti-war demonstrations went ahead. But many of the roads en route to the convention centre were completely empty of people. A garish van, bearing a complicated message about abortion and the slogan \"Republicans Repent\", was parked on a back street; outside the venue, a solitary seller of red-white-and-blue hats sat on a collapsible chair with her arms folded, staring grumpily at the space where her customers ought to have been lining up.</p> <p>The Republicans' decision to scale back the opening day of their convention is not without potential advantages for the McCain campaign. The absence of Bush and Cheney spares them the awkwardness of accommodating a president who is loved and distrusted in equal measure by different wings of the party, and disdained in the US at large. It also enables McCain to portray himself as a compassionate and bipartisan candidate, rising above politics. </p> <p>Several scheduled parties in St Paul have already been changed into Hurricane Gustav fundraisers, and at a rock concert in the city on Sunday night the former Van Halen guitarist Sammy Hagar, a Republican, sought to rouse the crowd to donate, with little success.</p> <p>The few delegates inside the Xcel Centre, though, had no time for the argument that the disruption might benefit their party. \"I just don't think there's that much strategy involved in it,\" Mosley said - a sentiment shared by Randy Pullen, head of the delegation from McCain's home state of Arizona. \"Everything's just more sombre. It's clear that every delegate is concerned about what's happening in the gulf,\" he said. \"That's number one on our minds.\" Republicans simply wanted to do what was right, he said. \"If Obama can talk about Katrina, McCain can start talking about Gustav.\"</p> <p>The hall itself, though, had been almost entirely stripped of any sign of partisanship. The convention's theme, \"Country First\", appears on every part of the hall that can be seen by television cameras - though areas visible to delegates, but not the main cameras, had the enormous words \"McCain 08\", to which a maintenance team was busy adding the word \"Palin\".</p> <p>\"It's not a problem,\" said a large man who identified himself only as a friend of the rightwing talkshow host Rush Limbaugh, referring to the change of schedule. \"None of this is a problem. McCain will win, and it won't even be close. Obama's just an empty suit. The more he talks, the less people like him.\"</p> <p>Christopher Harvey, from Texas, dressed like the rest of his delegation in denim shirt and cowboy hat, seemed similarly confident. \"It's early in the convention yet,\" he said. \"Just wait.\"</p>",
  "<p>In Neal Lawson and Robert Philpot's debate on the future direction of Labour, Philpot claims the party is \"giving greater control over public services to those who use them\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/08/labour.thinktanks\">Battle for the soul of the Labour party</a>, August 9). This extraordinary assertion requires a challenge - particularly when it comes to the NHS.</p> <p>When Labour came to power community health councils had been in place for more than 20 years. They held the health service to account and had strong local loyalty. Many NHS innovations were pioneered by CHCs - advocacy, surveys, community development projects, patient support groups. They had statutory powers to obtain information, and to visit hospitals and other institutions, and had access to health authorities and their senior officers. CHCs were not afraid to criticise government policies but - while useful to Labour in opposition - they were a potential obstacle to the implementation of the new government's reforms. In 1997 moves began to get rid of them. CHCs were abolished, not without a struggle, in 2003, and replaced by a series of increasingly weak structures. </p> <p>Philpot says: \"It's so important that, as we shift power out of Whitehall, we place it in the hands of individual citizens.\" However, as Lawson says, \"[while] people want more control over public services ... this should happen collectively\". Individuals acting alone are weaker than accountable community organisations, which can genuinely \"achieve a transformation of lives and society\", to use Lawson's phrase.</p> <p>Philpot claims that empowering such accountable organisations, rather than individual citizens, \"is a sure-fire route to ensuring that the sharp-elbowed middle classes get their way at the expense of the disadvantaged\". In fact it is the most sure-fire route to ensuring that everyone gets the best public services possible.</p> <p>Primary care trusts (PCTs), responsible for healthcare at a local level, are not accountable to the local population, They are unelected, forming the basis of a democratic deficit that runs through the NHS, where the only elected person in the hierarchy is the secretary of state.</p> <p>While the government will claim that it holds public consultations, at these events leading questions are asked and information is withheld. And plans for polyclinics were going ahead while the \"consultation\" was still in progress. The key issue of what kind of organisation will provide a proposed new service or take over an existing one - NHS, private or voluntary sector - will not be subject to consultation. In Camden, thousands of patients signed petitions condemning the PCT's decision to award local GP practices to United Healthcare; the PCT, well aware of local anger, hastened to sign off the contract. When the BMA collected over a million signatures in two weeks in support of GP surgeries, the government labelled the campaign \"mendacious\". It seems ministers only want to listen to patients who agree with their policies.</p> <p>Despite Philpot's claims of \"greater control\", the ability of patients to influence the direction of healthcare reforms under New Labour has been inversely proportional to the government's rhetoric on the subject. Powerful, locally accountable organisations have been replaced by the fragmented voices of \"individual citizens\", which the government has either cynically manipulated or ignored.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jacky Davis is an executive member of the Keep Our NHS Public campaign <a href=\"http://www.keepournhspublic.com\">keepournhspublic.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The zeitgeist of this damp and uneasy summer might have been split between Beijing, Tskhinvali and Southwold, but we should also spare a thought for the Cretan town of Malia. By way of a counterpoint to the high achievers in China, its streets have formed the backdrop to a story not just devoured by the UK press, but in the New York Times, which maligned this country as \"the largest exporter of inebriated hooligans in Europe\". The evidence: thousands of rampaging young Britons, drawn by such local attractions as the \"Headfucker\", a terrifying cocktail served - of course - in a goldfish bowl. </p> <p>Earlier this month, the Police Federation reported a surge in violent crime perpetrated by young women that was at least partly traceable to drink. The recent controversy about compensation for rape victims being cut in cases involving alcohol might have involved the outrage of people who smelled the old \"asking for it\" myth, but it also highlighted the fact that so many people - of both sexes - routinely render themselves vulnerable to all kinds of Saturday-night horrors. A few weeks ago, the Foreign Office revealed the number of Britons arrested at 15 selected holiday resorts was up year-on-year by over 16%, and publicised an elegant government campaign built around the slogan \"Don't be a Dick\". </p> <p>A government inquiry into the UK alcohol trade that reported in July said undercover teams had discovered \"a disturbing level of irresponsible and harmful practice in significant sections of the industry\". Their findings were not revelatory: in bars and clubs they found \"low-price offers, inducements by DJs to consume greater quantities, and glamorisation through links with sexual imagery\". Supermarkets, meanwhile, offered \"significant financial incentives to bulk purchase\", with mouthwatering offers \"displayed at point-of-sale, or prominently by the door\".</p> <p>In response, something faintly amazing has happened: the government has departed from its long-standing belief in \"self-regulation\", and apparently set itself on what the health minister Dawn Primarolo calls \"a far tougher approach to the alcohol industry\". Or maybe not: according to her Home Office colleagues, legislation to make standards mandatory will only be introduced \"if necessary\". Such hesitance isn't a surprise: these are the same people who recently commissioned the University of Sheffield to look into the link between the historically low price of booze and rising levels of binge-drinking.</p> <p>Holding forth about all this isn't easy, not least because the national weakness for alcohol has been as firmly built into my consciousness as anyone else's. What has changed since my teenage cider binges, however, is the behaviour of an industry that seems to know no limits. In my native Manchester, the late 1990s saw the capacity of licensed premises increase by a mind-boggling 242%, thanks chiefly to those great urban sheds where rapid intoxication is ensured by the absence of seating. Perhaps most remarkably, supermarkets now offer help to those who want to imbibe at the lowest possible cost. In my local Morrisons, a 24-can slab of Carlsberg sells for \u00a310.98 - 45p per 440ml can; had those prices been around when I was a student, me and most of my friends would have sat our finals and then taken the 12 steps.</p> <p>So what can be done? The government continues to emphasise the need for more consultation, but when I phoned a handful of alcohol industry spokespeople, their responses made for a predictable mess of spin and buck-passing. Despite evidence to the contrary, drinks producers claimed a positive record on social responsibility and pointed the finger at shops, bars, pubs and clubs. </p> <p>The man from the British Beer and Pub Association, whose voluntary code of practice on bar promotions was recently abandoned on advice that it contravened European law, claimed such matters were too complex for Westminster diktat, and got in a lather about the supermarkets. Morrisons, meanwhile, declined to comment on the aforementioned lager price, blandly claiming to \"take our responsibility with regard to selling alcohol very seriously\". </p> <p>In fairness to the health department, at least some of what it says cuts through such cant and points in roughly the right direction: it now admits there is \"no strong evidence\" that strengthening self-regulation would arrest our descent into soused dysfunction (according to its figures, over the past four years, drink-related hospital admissions have risen by an amazing 70%), so one draws the inevitable conclusion: that the argument for the solid thwack of state intervention is unanswerable. </p> <p>There are already rumblings about a move against \"vertical drinking establishments\" and forcing supermarkets to sell booze separately \u00e0 la cigarettes, but much more could be done. England and Wales could follow Scotland's example, and its proposals to make 21 the legal age for buying booze in shops. Certainly, time needs to be called on the big retail chains using cut-price drink as a loss leader, and on this score there is no alternative to the clunking legislative fist: as the government's own bumf says, UK competition law rules out voluntary agreements on price, thus inviting \"a separate statutory requirement\".</p> <p>Not so long ago, an anguished minister told me the key to a resurrection of Gordon Brown's prospects lay in a revival of the moral certainty glimpsed in the cancellation of the Manchester supercasino. Here is an obvious opportunity: the make-or-break conference speech he is set to make in that city next month. Surrounded by streets that reflect the booze trade's absence of restraint as much as any Greek resort, he could take aim at the supermarkets, bar chains and fly-by-night club owners, and use the kind of words that usually elude him - not \"we are in the midst of a review\", but something altogether more simple: \"This is wrong.\"</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:john.harris@theguardian.com\">john.harris@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The first thing that strikes you about Emmanuel Ledesma is that he is very much a reflection of the Queens Park Rangers team, in the way he plays the game and the positions he takes up. It is very difficult to identify the role he is playing: a mix between right wing, right midfield, tucked in right-sided or wide right in a front three.</p> <p>The same could be said of QPR's team shape as they have one or two players who play just about anywhere. With this in mind it was no surprise that they beat Doncaster, a side who keep the ball on the ground, 2-0, yet lost 3-0 at Sheffield United, a more physical side. Revealingly, Ledesma was criticised in the defeat and praised in the win. </p> <p>He is the type that is extremely easy on the eye for supporters but may on occasion need to put in more of a shift when QPR find the going tougher than against Carlisle, whom I watched them play last week. </p> <p>On the night, Ledesma was fantastic, scoring a brilliant hat-trick and making each goal look ridiculously easy, when in reality they would have been little more than half-chances against different opposition. He is neat and tidy in possession, due to having two good feet. He is mainly left-footed, playing on the right, although he can look lightweight at times and will have to get used to the physical side of the game - because of the position he played when he received the ball, he was often tightly marked. </p> <p>He tended to drift in and out of the game, and because of this sometimes his marker switched off. Ledesma was very quick to exploit this, once with a superbly-timed run in between the two centre-halves. He received the ball on the run and in one movement brought it down and was unlucky with a half-volley not to lob the onrushing keeper.</p> <p>Occasionally Ledesma tracked back, although this seemed to be done more through personal choice than team orders. When he did this on the whole he stayed with his man to the end, seeing the danger out. Initially, I wondered why he wasn't involved in dead-balls: QPR had a free-kick and corner from the left and he stayed on the edge of the attacking box, but this was quickly rectified after a terrific run in which he showed real pace in possession, forcing a corner down the right from which he then whipped in a fantastic near-post ball for his centre-half to score.</p> <p>It was then that he took centre stage with his goals, but at the same time it was good that he didn't try to do too much on the ball, keeping passes short and simple. But unless you give him possession with plenty of service, there is a danger he could be a little peripheral without the ball.</p> <p>QPR and Ledesma are both a work in progress - his sending-off for two yellow cards on Saturday at Bristol City showed that - and while I'm sure both the team and the player will provide the fans with plenty of entertainment, whether the balance within his game and QPR's as a team is the right one to get success at this stage I'm not entirely convinced.</p> <p><strong>Age </strong>20</p> <p><strong>Born</strong> Buenos Aires, Argentina</p> <p><strong>Position </strong>Midfield</p> <p><strong>Height </strong>5ft 11in </p> <p><strong>Weight</strong> 12st 2lb</p> <p><strong>From </strong>Genoa</p> <p><strong>Pace </strong>8/10</p> <p><strong>Shooting </strong>9/10</p> <p><strong>Crossing </strong>9/10</p> <p><strong>Heading </strong>7/10</p> <p><strong>Team responsibility</strong> 7/10</p> <p><strong>Valuation</strong> \u00a3750,000</p>",
  "<p>Anyone slightly above driving age will have realised the title of this column is a tug of the forelock to Alex Cox's <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/kurtodrome/drome.html\">Moviedrome</a> TV series - a selection of cult movies that ran on BBC2 in the late 80s and early 90s. (If you've ever watched Cox's movies, you'll know why it featured titles like A Bullet for the General, Kiss Me Deadly and Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia.) Cox has just published his film-making memoirs <a href=\"http://www.ibtauris.com/display.asp?ISB=9781845115661\">X Films: True Confessions of a Radical Film-Maker</a>, and as well as offering much detailed insight into the apparently-thankless task of being an independent film director, it also motivated me to have another look at what now emerges as his rather impressive central American trilogy.</p> <p>As a film-maker, of course, Cox is rather hamstrung by the fact that his first two films - Repo Man and Sid &amp; Nancy - remain his most successful and most enduring. They are also official \"punk\" films, and like his pals the Clash, Cox found the lure of mid-80s revolutionary movements in Nicaragua, Guatemala et al impossible to resist. The 1987 film <a href=\"http://www.alexcox.com/dir_walker.htm\">Walker</a> was his <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandinista!\">Sandanista!</a>, a real triple-album of a movie, starring Ed Harris as US freebooter William Walker, who invaded Nicaragua in the 1850s and set himself up as president - before being executed by firing squad in Honduras in 1860. </p> <p>It's amazingly ambitious for a Hollywood film (for Hollywood it was), and also something of a career suicide note for Cox - but he's still fantastically proud of it, describing it in his book as \"my best, my most expensive, and my least-seen film\". </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337136721\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/30/pulverwalker460.jpg\" alt=\"The Walker\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Looking at it now, it's extraordinary that a film on this subject could get off the ground on such a large scale, and since its revolutionary sentiments ran so counter to the current of the times it's hardly a surprise it was such a commercial failure. Cox's fondness for agit-prop magic realism probably didn't help, with lots of spaghetti-western-style gore and self-consciously anachronistic interpolations. But I'd urge you to dig it out again and have a look.</p> <p>For his second central American film, Cox went to the source, actually shooting in Spanish with a Mexican cast for his 1991 film <a href=\"http://www.alexcox.com/dir_highwaypatrolman.htm\">El Patrullero </a>(Highway Patrolman). I remember going to see it when it came out, and basically being a bit baffled as to what the Repo Man guy was up to - but now El Patrullero looks great, filmed with masterly long takes (a method called \"plano secuencia\" that Cox learned from Arturo Ripstein). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337136722\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/30/pulver2460.jpg\" alt=\"Highway Patrolman\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Highway Patrolman is a beautifully observed, morally intelligent film about what Cox calls \"the impossibility of imposing good on people\", and Cox found a great lead actor in Roberto Sosa - though he <a href=\"http://us.imdb.com/media/rm372019200/nm0554929\">looks a bit different now</a>.</p> <p>Following that, Cox went back to Mexico in 1992 to make an adaptation of a Jorge Luis Borges story, <a href=\"http://www.alexcox.com/dir_deathandcompass.htm\">Death &amp; the Compass</a>. Originally a BBC commission, Death &amp; the Compass was a much less happy affair. Cox's book goes into detail as to exactly how it devastated him financially (as well as telling a very funny story about Alan Yentob sleeping through a personal screening); suffice to say, Cox was forced to take a despised job-for-hire to see himself through. (That film, The Winner, barely gets a sniff in X Films.) </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337136723\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/30/pulverdeathcompas460.jpg\" alt=\"Death & the Compass\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Being a paid-up entrepreneur, Cox has held on to the rights for as many of his films as possible, so the feature version of Death &amp; the Compass <a href=\"http://filmstore.bfi.org.uk/acatalog/info_144.html\">hasn't disappeared from view</a>. The most obvious thing about it is that Cox was making the most of much-reduced budgets; like all his films since, the expansive horizons of Highway Patrolman and Walker are nowhere to be found. But Cox makes up for it with creatively imagined cinematography, luridly coloured and weirdly shot - no doubt intended to complement Borges' intricate prose. Whether Borges is in fact remotely suitable for cinematic adaptation is another question entirely \u2014 lots of reviewers hated the film (Variety called it a \"wretched... bleary-eyed fever dream\"; the LA Times \"a frustrating ... exercise in tedium and pretentiousness). But if you stick with it, and perhaps gen up on the story beforehand, it's strong, impressive stuff, and is very much a forerunner, stylistically speaking, to the rather more sedate Revengers Tragedy. </p> <p>Since Death &amp; the Compass, Cox's output has become somewhat erratic, as the chill winds of film finance dictate. He used to live in Liverpool, and has since relocated to Oregon (which presumably motivated him to make the not-too-far-away Searchers 2.0). But his Latin American product has always been special; let's hope he gets back there soon.</p>",

Anyway, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/dragonsden/\">Dragons' Den</a> is back tonight from <strong>9pm</strong> on <strong>BBC2</strong>, and I'll be here to savour the delights of Episode Seven.</p> <p>Feel free to join in by leaving your thoughts in the box below, and don't forget to press refresh every now and then to see updates and new comments. </p> <p>Tonight we are promised all manner of weirdness, including fat-free curry sauces, which could be quite interesting - remember the Reggae Reggae Sauce Man? Now to be found in a Subway near you (the sandwich shop, not the underpass), and doing rather splendidly by all accounts. And some blinds, and jewellery boxes, and something to do with antiques, and radiators. I'm guessing at least one idea will be fabulous and investable, and the rest will be shot down in dragony flames.</p> <p>On the subject of which, my random thought for today was \"if the dragons in Dragons' Den were actual dragons (i.e from films/TV, rather than ACTUAL dragons, which as far as I'm aware aren't real, apart from the Komodo ones, which are just big lizards, surely?), who would each den dragon be?\" Unfortunately my musings ran out of steam when around about the time I ran out of dragons, which was after Puff The Magic, Pete's Dragon (Theo, definitely), the one in Lord of the Rings and various quite scary examples in shit 80s cartoon Dungeons and Dragons. Oh, and the ones in Harry Potter 4, in which case Peter Jones is definitely a Hungarian Horntail. Feel free to add to this scintillating debate.</p> <p>Back at 9!</p> <p><strong>21:00</strong>: Dragons striding down a cobbled street, all self-made millionaires, retail magnates, flag bearers for capitalists everywhere blah blah etc.</p> <p>First up, 3 entrepreneurs called Dominic, Simeon and Janice from London who want \u00a340k for 15% share of Blindsinabox - instant paper blinds that come in a box. As opposed to the kind that come nailed to the back of a dolphin.</p> <p>They are looking to supply the athlete's village at the 2012 olympics. What, to shield our eyes from all the inevitable blazing sunshine, or to protect our corneas from being seared by the horror of Boris Johnson's wardrobe?</p> <p>Basically it's some folded paper, with a sticky strip at the top which costs \u00a345 at retail. Oh, that's for 6. In a box. They have pitched to one retailer, which James Caan is not very impressed with. It was a strategic decision, says Dominic. Well it was a crap one, says James, grumpily.</p> <p>Theo is out - he isn't happy about the fact that there is no patent, so anyone could make it. Actually I think I could make it, to be fair. Peter doesn't even think they are fit for caravans, not that he's an unbearble snob or anything. James Caan, despite his original miseryguts-ness, has cheered up and decided to offer them the whole lot for 50% of the business.</p> <p>Duncan is also interested, if James will share the deal. The team don't want to give away 50% because there are three of them, which would leave them with about \u00a32.50 each. They agree to go down to 40% if the team meet their sales projections, so they have a deal.</p> <p>My goodness, money being spent this early on! I foresee more cash-waving by the end of this episode.</p> <p>Next up, a husband and wife Simon and Gaby (Myleene Klass's mum?) who have an 'eponymous' auction business that they want to take online. I have no idea what that means, but Simon has lost \u00a3350k of his parent's money in that last 2.5 years. Yeah, bye.</p> <p><strong>21:21:</strong> Into the den comes Tiny Deol, who claims to have produced the world's first fat and cholesterol free curry sauces, but has waved a magic curry wand that means they keep the flavour. Which sounds like rather good idea if you ask me, and she's doing a cracking pitch. She wants \u00a342k for 15% of her business.</p> <p>She sold tons on QVC, we hear. Hey, don't knock QVC, I used to sell stuff on there. Theo hates the label, it's got too many messages and looks a mess. She lost \u00a370k last year, and her various businesses are starting to look a bit murky, and it's all going a bit wrong. Peter thinks Tiny's chances of success are tiny - what a wag. James Caan is happy to introduce her to a friend in the ethnic foods business (aww, how nice), but all the dragons are out.</p> <p><strong>21:30:</strong> Ooh, it's two chaps with an online recruitment firm called The Career Mole, which is very interesting. To me anyway, because when I'm not doing this liveblogging business I work in recruitment. You probably don't give a shit, to be fair. I have no idea how this works, it's got something to do with moles in businesses promoting their company. They get kicked out (small hurrah from me, my day job is saved).</p> <p>Now it's Granny Elizabeth Pimm, who has come up with an idea for something called a BabyGo, which is a single set of everything you need to change a baby's nappy when you're out and about. Rather than, say, placing all the individual items you need in a bag before leaving the house. Which is cheaper, and more sensible, no? Bye, Granny Pimm.</p> <p>Next up is Martin Wadsworth, has developed a radiator that looks like a skirting board, because normal radiators convect rather than radiate, apparently. I see nowhere for me to hang my knickers though - do you, Martin? Get out, you're fired.</p> <p>He wants \u00a3150k for 10% of his business. The dragons are quite interested, including Deborah, who clearly doesn't need anywhere to hang her frillies. Duncan has concerns about the cost of retro-fitting these, and asks lots of questions about Martin's finances. He's put \u00a3400k of his own money in the business so far, and isn't making any money. Hmm.</p> <p>Peter knows nothing about radiators, and clearly doesn't care, so he's out. Deborah is worried about the cost, so she's out too. They are dropping like the flies behind my radiators.</p> <p>Duncan comes up with his method of pipes and fascias, and Martin throws out a few withering put-downs that puts the little goblin-man in his place. I like him, as do the dragons, but they're not giving him any money.</p> <p><strong>21:46:</strong> Next up, two blokes called Paul and John who have come up with an idea for over-packaged pre-scooped ice cream, presumably for lazy people who are too fat to wield a spoon. Which is quite possibly the stupidest idea EVER. Next.</p> <p>Father and son John and Gerald have a shelf that plugs into an electrical socket or shaver point. I'm not sure what the point is - is it a travel shelf, for all your on-the-go shelving needs? It requires a screwdriver, which means I'm out. Theo goes and breaks it, just for fun.</p> <p>Next up Christian &amp; Rachel, who have a business called the Tiny Box Company, a gift packaging company that makes jewellery boxes etc. out of recycled packaging. They want \u00a353k for 20% of their business.</p> <p><strong>21:53:</strong> Duncan wants to know if her interest in recycled packaging is a crusade. He calls her 'pathetic', which is nice. Rude bastard.</p> <p>Rachel has weird hair, and I'm finding it hard to concentrate on anything else. I fear she may look like Crystal Tips usually but has gone a bit mad with the straighteners. None of the dragons seem to like her ethical packaging idea, because they are all evil capitalists.</p> <p>Theo probes their background - Christian used to be a DJ on Kiss 100 FM, before he was forced to play 'Seven Days' by Craig David one time too many and ended up in rehab. OK I made that bit up, but he definitely met Rachel on a Monday, took her for a drink on Tuesday, and was running a business with her by Wednesday.</p> <p>God, I wish this blog had a laughter track. All I hear are tumbleweeds and the voices in my head.</p> <p>Rachel was something in sales for a software house, then went into hospital for an appendectomy, got a killer virus (as you do) and lost her job, her house and everything. Never mind jewellery boxes, has no-one interviewed this woman for <em>Closer</em>?</p> <p>Peter likes their story, and suddenly they are investable. Umm, why?</p> <p>He offers them \u00a360k for 40%, if Theo goes in with them. Theo is not sure if they aren't deeply flaky, but goes for it anyway.</p> <p>So it would seem that the way to get investment is to talk rehab and near-death experiences. Get the ice cream blokes back in, one of them must be going through a horrible divorce.</p> <p>And that's it for this week - thanks for joining (we were few in numbers but high in specialness this evening) - I'll be back next Monday for the final episode of the series. Which will pull out some big guns, surely? Ooh, I'm almost excited. G'night all!</p>",
  "<p>European leaders launched a \"crucial\" mission to mediate with the Kremlin over the Caucasus crisis today, saying relations between the EU and Russia were at a crossroads.</p> <p>An emergency summit in Brussels of 27 EU government chiefs delivered a strong signal of support for Georgia, freezing talks on a new strategic pact with Russia until Moscow observed the terms of a ceasefire agreed three weeks ago.</p> <p>The leaders demanded that no country follow Russia in recognising the independence of Georgia's two breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p> <p>\"That decision is unacceptable,\" the summit leaders said, condemning the Russians for failing to keep promises they made when signing the French-brokered ceasefire.</p> <p>Nicolas Sarkozy, the French and current EU president who called the emergency summit, said Moscow's relations with the west were at stake in the Caucasus. He will go to Moscow next week, along with the European Commission chief, Jose Manuel Barroso, and the EU foreign policy supremo, Javier Solana, to mediate over Georgia and more broadly to gauge Russia's commitment to a values-based relationship with Europe.</p> <p>\"The question is what does Russia want,\" Sarkozy said of the Kremlin's decision to invade and partition Georgia. \"It takes two to tango. The meeting [in Moscow] on September 8 will be crucial for relations between Russia and the EU.\"</p> <p>The summit statement called on Russia \"not to isolate itself\" and shelved negotiations scheduled for a fortnight's time on the new strategic partnership unless the Russians pulled back their forces in Georgia to positions before the conflict erupted on August 7.</p> <p>\"Relations between the EU and Russia have reached a crossroads,\" a summit statement said last night, announcing that \"the various aspects of EU-Russia relations\" would be subjected to \"a careful in-depth examination\" by a scheduled Europe-Russia summit in November in Nice, southern France.</p> <p>Gordon Brown insisted on the suspension of the negotiations on the new accord with Moscow and ran into stiff resistance from EU governments who cautioned against \"the situation spiralling out of control\", according to a European diplomat.</p> <p>But Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, the Scandinavians, and the central Europeans backed the British demand. Brown also successfully lobbied for the summit statement to pledge Europe to reducing its dependence on Russian energy supplies.</p> <p>The meeting strongly condemned Russia's redrawing of Georgia's borders and affirmed that Georgia was entitled to resist Russian pressure and to freely determine its own foreign policy and which \"alliances\" to join.</p> <p>\"We cannot go back to the age of spheres of influence. Yalta is dead,\" said Sarkozy of the 1945 agreement between the victors of the second world war that launched the cold war and erected an \"iron curtain\", splitting Europe in two.</p> <p>\"Russia has shown its true face,\" said a European foreign minister. \"The problem for us is how are we going to respond.\" </p> <p>The European leaders, divided themselves over attitudes to Russia and reluctant to punish the world's biggest energy supplier at a time of record energy prices, have limited options for getting tough with Russia, and instead concentrated on helping and supporting Georgia. </p> <p>The summit agreed that EU states would send dozens of military ceasefire monitors to Georgia and would also dispatch a \"factfinding mission\" to explore the utility of an EU observer mission in Georgia. EU leaders had previously floated the idea of European armed peacekeepers. That option was ditched.\"There was no support for it among member states,\" said a diplomat.</p> <p>But the decision to freeze the negotiations due in two weeks' time invited an angry Russian response. \"Any attempt to punish another country is counter-productive or illegal. We need to resolve our problems in a civilised way, through dialogue,\" said Andrei Nesterenko, Russia's foreign ministry spokesman.</p> <p>The move could however be seen as counter-productive, since the EU is keener than Russia on the new pact. The negotiations had been frozen for almost two years on the European side until July, with first Poland and then Lithuania vetoing the talks with Russia. </p> <p>While Germany and other key EU states were keen to get the negotiations going, Moscow was unfazed. </p> <p>Earlier, Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, bluntly warned the west not to support Georgia's current leadership, saying this would be a mistake of \"truly historic proportions\".</p> <p>He said Moscow wanted the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, deposed. He also called for an arms embargo on Georgia, saying this was necessary until \"new\" leaders had taken over in Tbilisi and turned it into a 'normal state'.</p> <p>Lavrov reserved his harshest criticism for the US administration. \"The spectre of a great game is in the Caucasus again,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>So now Palin says h<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/us/international-usa-politics-palin.html?ei=5070&amp;emc=eta1\">er daughter is pregnant </a>\u2013 right now, five months. Click through and read the NYT story for the background on this if you're unfamiliar.<br> I doubt this is the end of this story. The McCain team has now opened up this can of worms. Very atypical, and bad message discipline. But it tells you they're frightened of something. And seeing as how this is the kind of story that's of interest to the supermarket tabloids as well as the blogs, whatever facts exist are sure to be unearthed.  Obviously many of the wingers who love Palin will rally around her in the face of this despicable assault by the Godless liberal media. But some number will surely be bothered that she raised a daughter who did this. Remember how Rove said Bush's DUI, revealed the Friday before the election, cost him three or four points with evangelicals in 2000? There's bound to be a similar effect here.</p>",
  "<p>The danger posed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hurricanegustav\">Hurricane Gustav</a> to the people in the heart of New Orleans is not as great as it was during Katrina, because the storm surge is coming from a different direction. But there is still danger. With no electricity, there are no services.</p> <p>Most people are frightened to death. Many left days before the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/31/us/31orleans.html?ref=todayspaper\">official evacuation</a> began Sunday morning. People know, down to the tiniest detail, the ramifications of catastrophic flooding <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2008/sep/01/climatechange.hurricanegustav\">should the levees not hold</a>.</p> <p>My family evacuated to my sister-in-law's condo in Baton Rouge, driving from New Orleans on back roads to avoid the crowded interstate. For the time being, there is still electricity, though power is now out at my home in uptown New Orleans, in the university area.</p> <p>New Orleans residents have hope, but they also did all the things responsible people do: sharing contact information with family and friends, boarding up houses, paying bills, buying supplies for power outages, turning off the gas, completely emptying out their refrigerators and freezers, parking cars on high ground, putting valuables up high or on the second floor, packing for weeks instead of days. Folks have all known since Monday last week exactly where they would evacuate. It was the talk of the town.</p> <p>In the minds of New Orleanians, the tragedy of Katrina was not the failed response. The tragedy was how, when Katrina barrelled through, New Orleans was overly vulnerable to storm surge, and that should never have happened. </p> <p>What happened during Katrina was engineering failure, not natural disaster.</p> <p>New Orleanians are not afraid of Gustav. They fear the failure of the federal levees. And design and construction of the levees is - by federal mandate in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_Control_Act_of_1965\">Flood Control Act of 1965</a> - the sole responsibility of the US Army Corps of Engineers.</p>",
  "<p>Another Premier League season, another little heard of Arab takeover looms into view. In echoes of the protracted love triangle between Tom Hicks, George Gillette and DIC over the ownership and future of Liverpool, another rich consortium on the banks of the Persian Gulf has dipped its toe into the waters of Premiership club ownership. This time, though, the Abu Dhabi United Group for Investment and Development [Adug], has met with markedly less resistance.</p> <p>Thaksin Shinawatra, the controversial ex-PM of Thailand who has been at Manchester City's helm for little more than a year, clearly thought it in the best interests of his club to step aside. With $3bn worth of assets still frozen by the Thai government, anti-Thaksin protests crippling Bangkok and a member of the Man City board having to throw in the odd \u00a32m loan to make sure the tea lady got her wages on time, it was clear his financial muscle had been curtailed. This is not a problem that Adug is ever likely to experience if, as expected, Man City's accounts are in order and it takes control of the club in two weeks time. But what do we know about the new owners?</p> <p>Initially, it appeared that the bid came from an offshoot of Abu Dhabi's huge sovereign investment fund, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. The United Arab Emirates is made up of seven small emirates, each run by its own absolute monarch. But Abu Dhabi is the biggest and most powerful of the seven, bigger even than Dubai. It is the seat of power, the nation's capital and also the emirate where almost all of the country's vast oil reserves, estimated at almost 10% of known oil worldwide, resides. It is thought that the Emir, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al Nahyan, owns the richest sovereign fund in the world. Yet the Adug consortium has initially denied that the deal is connected to the government. According to Sulaiman Al Fahim, who brokered the deal and sits on Adug's board, it is merely a group of \"prestigious businessmen\". But in a society where patronage and royal decree are the driving forces behind business success, those closer to the deal suspect differently.</p> <p>\"This is all the Abu Dhabi royal family,\" explained Anil Bhoyrul, the former Mirror journalist who broke the story for his Dubai-based magazine Arabian Business. \"This [Adug] is essentially an investment vehicle set up for Man City and funded by sheikhs in the royal family. It's not exactly clear which sheikhs it is yet but this is the Abu Dhabi royal family.\" It is no surprise either that the deal has followed on the heels of DIC's attempts to buy Liverpool. Since the country's creation in 1971 \u2013 a move driven by Sheikh Khalifa's father, the revered late Sheikh Zayed \u2013 Dubai and Abu Dhabi have competed against each other for the world's affections, a rivalry that has gone into overdrive since the turn of the century.</p> <p>When Dubai built its own seven-star hotel, the Burj Al Arab, Abu Dhabi responded with its own, the Emirates Palace. When Dubai embarked on huge, glamorous construction projects that stole headlines across the world, Abu Dhabi followed suit with plans to build a Guggenheim and a Louvre. Even sporting events have witnessed this economic one-upmanship, with Abu Dhabi setting up a rival to Dubai's PGA tour golf event and tennis tournament.<br>From the outside, it appeared that Abu Dhabi resented the success of its glamorous neighbour. Dubai's royal family had been so successful in branding the emirate that many assumed that it, and not Abu Dhabi, was the capital of the UAE. So when DIC, itself an investment arm of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's sovereign fund, tried and failed to buy a Premier League club, Abu Dhabi just had to keep up with the Joneses. Well, the Maktoums.</p> <p>\"DIC was actually looking at Man City, and then the Abu Dhabi people came in,\" explains Bhoyrul. \"Apparently they were told by Man City that they couldn't deal with them at first as they were already dealing with someone from Dubai! But that changed when they explained they were from Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi is competing with Dubai to be a global player. There is a huge rivalry between the two.\" Man City fans have already come to terms with the fast-paced life of being a petrodollar plaything: a top-four finish this season has been promised with Champions League football to follow. And if Dimitar Berbatov's move goes through before the deadline it will represent only the start of a huge recruitment drive. Already a list of six players has been drawn up to be targeted in the January transfer window. The list, Bhoyrul says, will \"make Berbatov's signing pale in comparison\".</p> <p>Of course, rich sugar daddies have come in before with their smooth moves, making grand promises and wooing us with some intoxicated lovelorn chat only to sneak out in the morning with the family silver while we're still sleeping. But there are signs that this investment has a stronger footing than, say, Hicks and Gillette's investment in Liverpool. The aim of any business is to turn a profit, but there are far more important forces at work. The motivation here has a tinge of nationalism. Buying Man City is as much about putting Abu Dhabi's flag in the sand. The emirate wants to be a global sports hub, and there's no better way of fast-tracking that than buying one of the grande dames of English football. It is also ample evidence that the world's financial power base is shifting eastwards. But more importantly than that, the capture of Man City gets one over on Abu Dhabi's glamorous neighbours over their Eastern border. And that, they will conclude, is worth any price.</p> <p><em>When Friday Comes: Football in the War Zone (Mainstream), by James Montague, is out now</em></p>",
  "<p>An 18-month-old boy shot in the head with an airgun in the garden of his home last week died of his injuries today, police said. </p> <p>Rashid Ullah, who had been in a critical condition since the shooting on August 24, died this afternoon at Birmingham Children's Hospital, West Midlands police said. </p> <p>Officers are treating the incident, which happened in the garden of Rashid's home in Washwood Heath, Birmingham, as a tragic accident.</p> <p>The boy's grandfather has said that Rashid was accidentally shot by his five-year-old sister as they played with their father in the garden of their home. </p> <p>The exact circumstances of how the weapon came to be discharged are still being investigated, but it is thought that Rashid's father, Bakht Zaman, was using the gun moments before the accident, which happened shortly before 7pm.</p> <p>In a short statement, a police spokeswoman confirmed that Rashid had died of injuries in hospital. The boy's family had previously urged anyone in possession of airguns to be wary of the possible consequences of injuries caused by them. </p> <p>In a statement issued three days after the shooting, the toddler's family said: \"We hope that anyone who has an air weapon realises how dangerous these guns can be and what serious injuries they can cause. </p> <p>\"We do not wish to add anything further at this difficult time for our family and would ask the media to respect our privacy.\"</p>",
  "<p>Simon Barrow's attack on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/01/religion.faithschools\">faith schools</a> is also an attack on parents. I don't want to argue that parents are, or should be, the sole arbiters of what or how their children learn but, neither can they be entirely excluded from the process, and this is where his proposals lead.</p> <p>The crucial sentence comes very high up: \" ... good schooling is not about achievement at any cost. It is also about building educational bridges between children from different communities for the sake of a common future.\"</p> <p>To argue like this is to concede that some children will have to achieve less than they otherwise might for the sake of social harmony. I don't think that's politically workable unless the children who will lose are a very small minority with uninfluential parents; nor is it a self-evidently moral course of action. If Barrow concedes, as he does right there at the beginning, that faith schools as they currently exist are delivering greater achievement than their alternatives, he has lost the argument straight away. You can sell more egalitarian and more homogenous educational systems to the public in a democracy, providing it appears that everyone wins by them (is this the moment to point out that my daughter has just got into Cambridge from a comprehensive school?) But you cannot openly demand that parents sacrifice their own children's educational advantages for the benefit of other people's children \u2013 or if you do you will not be elected.</p> <p>It would be wrong to stop with that point, which makes the argument appear to be one between high-minded social reformers and grubby, selfish materialists who want the world to keep on getting worse. The grubby selfish materialists are actually rather more unselfish in real life.</p> <p>There are two serious points at issue here underneath the rhetoric. One is the collapse of the state education system in many parts of many cities, especially visible in <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23490243-details/More+schools+in+London+are+failing+Ofsted+inspections/article.do\">London</a>. If it weren't widely believed, with lots of evidence, that some state schools deliver nothing that their children need, either in the way of formal skills or informal rules of conduct, then the argument about faith schools wouldn't be nearly so inflamed. This isn't necessarily to blame the teachers in the failing schools: no doubt they are doing their best and most would do much better in better schools.</p> <p>They are being asked to solve the insoluble problems dumped on them by a much wider society. But the fact remains that a sufficiently large minority of children who bring their problems to school with them can destroy it for everyone else. Once that happens, parents who have a choice will do anything to exercise it and get their children somewhere else and in the big cities most of the better alternatives are faith schools. That's not the fault of religious belief.</p> <p>The second problem, of course, is Islam. It makes no sense at all to suppose that people who worry about \"sectional interests\" being given priority over our children's shared future are afraid of disaffected and ghettoised youth emerging from Church of England primary schools. But the question here is whether social cohesion is better promoted by recognising Islamic schools within a system which can quite tightly control what is taught there and how, or attempting to suppress them altogether.</p> <p>Now, the <a href=\"http://www.accordcoalition.org.uk/index.php/our-members/\">Accord</a> proposals are quite simply a mess here. The demand for an \"objective, fair and balanced syllabus\" is one that no one could object to without clear examples of what these words mean; the demand for a single inspection for controversial subjects like religious education, personal, social, health education (PSHE) and citizenship is obviously aimed at controlling the possible excesses of fundamentalism and a good thing too. But to demand \"Inclusive, inspiring and stimulating assemblies\" is just to move piety out of school and into policy documents \u2013 not a huge improvement. And it is entirely unreasonable to demand that teaching staff, and especially headteachers, be hired without discrimination as to their ideals or beliefs. Pluralism demands that people we don't like should get jobs; in the end, if that is that other parents want, they are entitled to it, on any principles of equity and fairness.</p>",
  "<p>Further thoughts on the GOP and Gustav. There was a lot of hand-wringing on the blogs yesterday about how the GOP was going to turn this calamity to its great advantage. That is still possible, but as I wrote yesterday, I don't buy it. When I wrote it yesterday I was writing mostly on gut instinct, but now I have given the matter a little actual thought.</p> <p>Gustav is an external event of the sort that happens during campaigns all the time, large and small. One party or the other usually takes advantage of them or benefits from them. But which one, and how is that decided?</p> <p>Now: in America, the images of the two parties are deeply hard-wired into people's brains, even the brains of people who don't pay much attention to politics. Walk down the street in any town in America and ask average people what the two parties stand for. Unless you get highly opinionated partisans \u2013 \"Republicans are crypto-fascists,\" \"Democrats hate America,\" etc. \u2013 I would bet you'll hear remarkably consistent answers from people. </p> <p>Democrats care more about the poor, they're more for minorities, they back unions, they're not big on throwing America's weight around and they're softer on criminals would probably be about the main five identifiers. Republicans are for the rich, they're for business over unions, they're tougher on crime, they do like throwing the US's weight around and they talk a lot more about Jesus would be the about the main five GOP identifiers.</p> <p>These traits have existed for at least 30 years (Jesus), maybe 40 years (the soft power-hard power foreign policy divide, which dates to Vietnam) and up to 70 years (the economic traits, which date to the New Deal). They are so deep in the American psyche that practically nothing can dislodge them. Hypothetically, President Obama could get into office and start a war with Russia, and I bet even that wouldn't suddenly make average Americans believe the Democrats were now the hard-power party.</p> <p>Major externalities, when they occur, feed into the deeply held preconceptions of what each party is about. The Russia-Georgia crisis played well for McCain because Americans are just conditioned to think that the GOP is more likely to take care of business when it comes to Russia. </p> <p>In reality, McCain's views and those of his advisors are extreme and dangerous. But alas that isn't what matters here. What matters is the information the American people bring to the situation: the Republicans have always been tougher on Russia, a Republican president defeated the USSR (yes, extremely simplistic and US-centric; I'm not endorsing, just explaining), McCain is a tough guy and the Repubican, ergo QED.</p> <p>Now consider a flood, especially in the aftermath of Katrina, and especially a flood hitting an urban area, a situation that finds many African American people being interviewed on television, as is the case today. Your average American is not going to bring information to this picture that will make her conclude that the Republicans are the party to handle this. She will think, without even really knowing that she's thinking it, that this is a matter for the Democrats to take care of \u2013 that the Democrats will handle this situation with more empathy and, post-Katrina, more competence.</p> <p>I'm trying to think back over major external events in recent presidential campaigns. There actually haven't been many (and I don't think this will end up being a major one). The bin Laden video that surfaced in October 2004 surely helped Bush as it reminded people that he was still out there and probably made most of them think that we still needed the tough-guy party (the tough-guy party had failed to track him down, but remembering that requires taking an extra logical step that requires intellect instead of feeling, and most people don't take that step). </p> <p>The biggest fairly recent event I can remember was the Rodney King rioting of 1992. Those riots helped Clinton, I think. Now you might suppose at first blush that images of rioting black people would help the law-and-order party. But the incidents that sparked the rioting \u2013 the beating of King by LA cops and the subsequent acquittals of three of the four officers \u2013 were so overwhelmingly unjust to average people (even average white people) that the rioting was, in some sense, understandable to many people. The black residents of Los Angeles needed empathy and the country needed reconciliation. Those are things Democrats do.</p> <p>So \u2013 who trusts Republicans to make sure that poor people harmed by an act of God are going to get a fair shake? That's a tough one for them. They'll spin it that way, and many cable hosts will play along. But cable hosts have less power over the process that goes on in people's minds than these historical identifiers. So unless they come up with some blindingly brilliant manipulation that's beyond my imagining, I can't see the GOP winning the Gustav spin war. </p>",
  "<p><br>The bullish, combative and lengendary Art Blakey ... a bandleader with an uncanny talent-spotting ability. Photograph: Bill Spilka/Getty</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.clarktracey.com\">Clark Tracey</a>, the British jazz drummer, staged a four-night party to celebrate his 30-year career at Soho's Pizza Express Jazz Club last week. But it was a mini-season with a difference - Tracey didn't just set the shows up as workouts for his current band, but as reunions for three powerful groups he's led over a busy career since his famous pianist father Stan hauled him onstage as a nervous 17-year-old back in 1978.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guybarker.co.uk\">Guy Barker</a>, the now internationally acclaimed British trumpeter/composer, was a comparative unknown when he started out in one of Clark Tracey's early groups, and played at the first of the reunion gigs. During the interval, Barker reminded me of the influence the legendary Pittsburgh musician Art Blakey had had on Tracey, both as a drummer and as a bandleader whose signature quality was uncanny talent-spotting, coupled with the realism to understand that young talent quickly moves on.</p> <p>The informal youth-opportunities scheme of Blakey's earthy and thrilling Jazz Messengers group saw everyone from Wayne Shorter to a teenage Wynton Marsalis passing through the ranks. In hiring Guy Barker in the 1980s, and such innovative pianists as former Perrier Award-winner <a href=\"http://www.zoerahman.com\">Zoe Rahman</a> and Empirical's intriguing <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/kitsmusic\">Kit Downes</a>, Tracey has been doing Blakey's job - and with broadly similar musical materials - for the UK scene.</p> <p>Catalysts like Tracey and Blakey - who died in 1990, after having launched new jazz stars for over 30 years - provide crucial exposure for unknowns. Today, with conservatoires turning out scores of highly-trained and eager jazz musicians for whom there are precious few gigs, the role is growing in importance.</p> <p>The two men could hardly have had more contrasting personalities. Tracey is a selfless ensemble drummer, and a modestly broadminded individual who declares his amazement at the ideas his partners bring to the bandstand, and his hope that they'll force him to change his musical habits. Blakey was combative, bullish, and a very tough taskmaster from an old showbiz school. Legend had it that he was a pianist once, but a gangster promoter who already had a pianist invited Blakey to take up drums by pointing a gun at him.</p> <p>At a BBC show in the 80s, he refused to share a dressing-room with his band (\"I ain't sittin' in here with these mothers\") because it was a sign of disrespect not to give the boss his own room. When I interviewed him for the show, he was a nightmare in the run-through (\"You don't know nuthin' about our music\") and a breeze on the real take, having made his point that he was a man the media should step aside for.</p> <p>But on a bandstand, when it counted, Art Blakey was generous and open in what he did, rather than what he said. He wanted to help the music grow, as it always must. That's the way Clark Tracey views it too - and since he passes on that baton to the young players he recruits (Guy Barker is a prime example), jazz is going to be around for very a long time.</p>",
  "<p>Around a year ago the world was greeted with another file for the testosterone-fuelled archives of Vladimir Putin: the then Russian president as fisherman, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/gallery/2007/aug/14/russia.internationalnews?picture=330565632\">all bare-chested and muscles rippling </a>as he pulled trout from the Khemchik river in Siberia.</p> <p>Today the former-KGB officer and current Russian prime minister was out and about in another action-man guise, this time equipped in combat boots and camoflage fatigues on a tiger rescue mission. </p> <p>While Sarkozy, Brown, et al attempted to work out what to do in relation to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/01/russia.foreignpolicy\">Russian aggression towards Georgia in Brussels</a>, Putin was apparently busy rescuing a group of scientists and TV crew from an escaped tiger in the Far East.</p> <p>The incident was unfortunately not captured on film. The resulting measuring of teeth and checking of the animals tracking device/collar, however, can be seen here. </p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337180502\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>While on a visit to a national park to observe how the animals are monitored, a rare Ussuri tiger broke free threatening those in its immediate vicinity. But Putin reportedly leapt to action and shot the creature with a tranquiliser gun.</p> <p>According to the Interfax news agency, the camera crew from state TV channel Vesti realised the five-year-old tiger had become untied and were rescued by Putin.</p> <p>\"Thanks to the agile and timely action the tiger was immobilised,\" Interfax said.</p> <p>Afterwards, Putin was said to have stroked the animal's cheek, adding: \"She'll remember us.\"</p> <p>Of course, this is not the first time the Russian press have reported on their tough guy leader. Included in his macho moments are the Russian fighter jet look, and the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdXwu2MXR_s\"> judo-suit</a> on a Japanese visit.</p> <p>And in a neat conclusion to today's incident, after weeks of criticising the west over Georgia, Putin today offered some praise to the US \u2013 for its efforts in trying to save the endangered Ussuri from extinction.</p>",
  "<p>Today is the first day of Ramadan, the month of fasting, prayer, generosity and charity. Or is it?</p> <p>The Middle East may start the holy month as one, but Pakistan is often out of kilter. Muslims living as minorities in India, Europe and the Americas, without centralised religious authorities, are frequently left in confusion.</p> <p>The problem is that Ramadan, like all lunar months, begins the day after the first sighting of the sliver-thin new crescent moon, visible by up to an hour after sunset on the appropriate evening. The orbit of the moon around the earth is such that it can take up to three days for the whole world to actually see the crescent for the first time each month, even after clouds have cleared. But in an age of super-computer calculation and instant telecommunication, should this present such a problem? </p> <p>It is extremely ironic, not to say embarrassing, that the Muslim people, who led the world for a millennium in every scientific discipline, developed the scientific method itself and taught it to the west, are still in a state of chaos over a relatively simple matter of science and religion, ie the lunar calendar. </p> <p>A millennium ago, the Persian scientist and philosopher <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Biruni\">al-Bayruni</a> calculated the circumference of the earth with over 99% accuracy. Even earlier, the astronomers of the caliph at Baghdad had first measured the tilt of the earth's axis as being 23.5 degrees. Most of the major stars in the sky still carry Arabic names, for the Muslim civilisation took the Greco-Roman constellations and added invididual star names as part of their development of the knowledge of the ancient world before transmitting it to the modern one. Ptolemy's great works of astronomy, like the philosophical ones of Plato and Aristotle, largely reached Europe through Arabic translations.</p> <p>There are many factors contributing to this confusion. Apart from religious and political disunity, perhaps the biggest reasons are the gulf between science and shariah and the simplistic, literalist approach to shariah that characterises much of Muslim religious discourse and ignores the magnificent theory of <em>maqasid al-shariah,</em> or the higher objectives and spirit of the sacred law of Islam.</p> <p>Muslim scientists and experts in law (shariah) need to understand each other's disciplines, and we need more individuals who are well-versed in both areas, as we had for centuries. For example, the 14th-century theologian <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Taymiyyah\">Ibn Taymiyyah</a> was an expert in the astronomy of his age, effortlessly discussing difficult and technical astronomical terms such as conjunction, the \"arc of light\" and the \"arc of vision\" as well as factors affecting the visibility of the new moon such as the angles between moon and sun, moon and earth and even factors such as atmospheric humidity. All this, of course, in addition to his renowned expertise in the traditional Islamic sciences. </p> <p>This great scholar, writing seven centuries ago, correctly concluded that astronomical calculations could not be used to replace naked-eye sighting of the moon because, during his lifetime, no one could calculate the visibility of the new moon accurately. However, 700 years later, many traditionalists erroneously and anachronistically cling to the view of this great authority, or that of earlier expert astronomer-jurists, whilst ignoring the fact that science has progressed exponentially since then and that we are now able to confidently predict the visibility of the new moon with great precision.</p> <p>Experts in the <em>maqasid al-shariah,</em> the theory of the holistic intent of Islamic law, agree that calculations can obviously be used to replace and confirm naked-eye sightings of the new moon, and to reject impossible claimed sightings. One leading Islamic scholar, Ahmad Shakir, argued this as far back as 1939, except that he advocated using conjunction (the birth of the moon) instead of crescent-visibility as the starting-point of the new lunar month: visibility calculations were not accurate enough in his time, and have only become extremely precise over the last few decades. </p> <p>Contemporary experts in progressive interpretations of shariah agree that calculations of crescent-visibility can now be used to replace naked-eye sightings of the new moon. Those who disagree with this are unfortunately stuck in literalist approaches to shariah and the classical schools of Islamic law, arguing over individual texts from the Qur'an, Hadith and mediaeval books of Islamic law while forgetting the bigger picture, the holistic approach to the subject embodied in Maqasid theory and developed by the great scholars such as Ghazzali, Ibn Taymiyyah and Shatibi.</p> <p>The problem may be illustrated with the the Prophet's teaching (peace be upon him), \"Begin fasting when you see the new moon, and end fasting when you see the new moon.\" The opponents of calculation rigidly stick to a literalist interpretation of this instruction, insisting on physical sighting even when official declarations of moon-sighting are known to be flawed in many Muslim countries and when calculations give us a much more precise answer. They also forget that their mode of reasoning could equally be applied to the verse of the Qur'an (The Cow, 2:187) about fasting: \"Eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes apparent to you from the black thread [of night].\" Clearly, dawn only \"becomes apparent\" to us by physical sighting and therefore it could be argued that one cannot use calculations to determine prayer-times. Amazingly, it is not uncommon to see people going by clocks and timetables for prayers all year round, yet becoming extremely animated about rejecting calculations for the dates of Ramadan. </p> <p>Although it is true that physically seeing the dawn, sunset, new moon and other astronomical phenomena helps to keep us connected to the signs of God in nature, insisting upon this for everyone is not realistic in the modern world and does not offer practical, pragmatic solutions for modern societies dominated by clocks and calendars. The literal meaning of the above-mentioned prophetic teaching would still apply to people wishing to remain as connected as possible to natural cycles, while its interpretation from a <em>maqasid</em> viewpoint in modern society, especially for governments and religious authorities, would be, \"Base your worldwide, calculated lunar calendar on the visibility of the new moon.\"</p> <p>Bringing shariah into line with modernity and science using intrinsic Islamic principles of interpretation is an urgent need of our times. From human rights, especially those of workers and women in the Muslim world, to the place of faith and religion in modern societies, much progress can be made if we move away from literalist interpretations that fail to understand the nature of the modern world. As a symbol of Islam, the crescent moon is probably apt at the moment: it inspires chaos and disunity. But the good news is that moves to harmonise religion and reason, the sacred and the secular, are gaining momentum in the Muslim world. We can only hope that the clouds of confusion continue to clear and that the crescent moon will once again symbolise, not chaos and fragmentation, but enlightened Islamic contributions to humanity.<br></p>",
  "<p>Under-fives who play in the sandpit and recite nursery rhymes are to be assessed under a new government-enforced national curriculum that comes into force today. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/earlyyearseducation\">early years</a> foundation stage means that all childcare providers who are registered with and inspected by Ofsted \u2013 including nurseries and childminders - must monitor children's progress and record their performance against 69 government-set \"early learning goals\".</p> <p>When children enter compulsory schooling, they should be able to interact with others, negotiate plans and take turns in conversation, recite the alphabet, count to 10 and write simple letters, according to the targets.</p> <p>At five, each child will be assessed against 13 scales based on the learning goals put forward. Their score will result in an early years profile that must be passed to the Department for Children, Schools and Families.</p> <p>The new \"toddler curriculum\" will replace non-statutory guidance already in place and is aimed at providing the same standards of early learning across all areas of England. </p> <p>While care providers can choose to opt out of these new requirements, for example if they favour an alternative educational philosophy that introduces reading and writing at a later stage, they will have to apply for an exemption and run the risk of losing state funding. </p> <p>The Department for Children, Schools and Families' legal framework has come under attack by a group of education experts who feel that the curriculum is flawed, arbitrary and could have unforeseen negative effects on a child's development. </p> <p>\"The goals in this curriculum are just inappropriate for young children,\" said Kim Simpson, a Montessori practitioner and member of the Open Eye campaign against the new curriculum. \"If they are required by law to achieve certain goals when they are not ready, it could totally destroy their enthusiasm for learning.\"</p> <p>The experts emphasise the need to build a child's sense of self in their early years and object to the new curriculum being compulsory, as well as its emphasis on reading and writing at a young age. </p> <p>Government officials say the framework is a way of ensuring high standards of early education, and said the curriculum that has been based on research from top experts in the field.</p> <p>\"The EYFS will help make sure that all young children have the chance to engage in stimulating play and hear and respond to rich and varied language,\" said the children's secretary, Ed Balls, and children's minister Beverley Hughes in a joint letter to the managers of the country's 3000 children's centres. \"Children's centre staff will be able to use it to engage mothers and fathers, to make sure these experiences are built on at home.\"</p> <p>They added that children will not be tested and are expected to reach these goals at different ages so will not be deemed to have failed if they do not reach them.</p> <p>Balls said extra funding will be available to provide 15 hours of free childcare and early learning for the 25% most disadvantaged three and four year olds, a year before their peers receive the same entitlement. </p> <p>\"I am driven by a determination to make sure that the most disadvantaged children get the very best start in life,\" said Balls. \"We want to give all children a level playing field and help all parents get the best care and support for their children.\" <br> While the National Day Nurseries Association says that while it embraces the ideas behind the curriculum, it is concerned about the practicalities. \"We wouldn't want it to be a move to more paperwork and it is important for us that the approach remains flexible to each individual child,\" said a spokeswoman for the association. \"It continues the idea of a single national framework that is consistent, which is a development of what we had before.\"</p>",
  "<p>If one man stands between the EU and a lasting resolution of the Caucasus crisis, that man is Vladimir Putin. As Europe's leaders struggled to agree a response to Georgia's enforced partition ahead of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/01/russia.foreignpolicy\">today's emergency summit</a> in Brussels, Russia's <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/2658077/Vladimir-Putin-the-hero-saves-TV-crew-from-tiger-attack.html\">gun-toting prime minister</a> was pictured strutting across the Siberian taiga, wearing camouflage and a tough expression, doing his familiar \"Action Man\" impersonation.</p> <p>Putin's controlling hand has been in evidence since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">fighting erupted</a> last month. He flew immediately from Beijing to visit Russian invasion troops at staging areas on the Georgian border. It was Putin who muddied the waters with talk of legitimate Russian peacekeeping operations and unsubstantiated claims of genocide and \"ethnic cleansing\". It is Putin who now mocks talk of EU sanctions and hints at diverting Russian oil and gas from Europe to China.</p> <p>But for the most part Putin has used his hand-picked presidential successor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/03/russia\">Dmitri Medvedev</a>, as front man in fielding international outrage. While Medvedev dealt with French president Nicolas Sarkozy's frantic mediation efforts, fought the PR battle through stage-managed media interviews, and took the flak for Moscow's recognition of South Ossetian and Abkhazian independence, Putin deftly pulled the strings.</p> <p>Medvedev's stand-up role as a sort of home-grown \"useful idiot\" seems to have freed Putin from the constraints normally facing a head of state, allowing him greater freedom of action. Backroom manipulation appears to suit the former KGB spy. But he has developed a taste for personal headline-grabbing, too, as shown by his Siberian tiger shoot and his black arts propaganda skills in <a href=\"http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/LT666072.htm\">turning the tables</a> on the Bush administration.</p> <p>\"We know there were a lot of US advisers in Georgia. But (they) should be on firing ranges and teaching centres \u2013 but where were they? They were in the zone of military operations,\" Putin told German television at the weekend. \"That pushes one to the conclusion that the US leadership knew about the action that was being prepared and morever probably took part in it.</p> <p>\"If the US leadership has sanctioned that, then I have the suspicion that it was done specially to organise a small victorious war. And if that didn't work, then to create from Russia the appearance of an enemy and unite the (US) electorate around one presidential candidate.\"</p> <p>Putin went on: \"In a significant way the crisis was provoked, including by our American friends in the course of the elections struggle \u2026 This was the use of administrative resources in a deplorable way to provide advantage to one of the candidates, in the current case from the ruling (Republican) party.\"</p> <p>That the man who between 2000 and 2008 emasculated Russia's democratic institutions, silenced media and business critics, and eradicated independent centres of political and civil power should complain about \"administrative abuses\" will strike many as ironic. But that is not the main point at issue.</p> <p>The idea that Washington neocon warriors were somehow responsible for a full-scale Russian military invasion by land, air and sea of a tiny neighbour appeals greatly to western apologists, whose voices have grown shrill in recent weeks. More generally it plays on anti-American sentiment in Europe. That was Putin's calculated aim.</p> <p>While there is no evidence to support such a convoluted conspiracy theory, his words sent a chill. They revealed how implacable his hostility has become to what he perceives as Washington's quasi-imperial unipolarism, expressed most obviously through Nato's eastwards expansion. Putin's utter determination, aggressive style and deep cynicism suggest a comfortable, or even a mutually tolerant relationship between Russia on the one hand and the US and European allies such as Britain on the other is improbable as long as he wields back-seat-driver power.</p> <p>This may come as no surprise to those, such as journalist Alan Cowell, who have followed Putin's rise and rise from the apartment block bombings and the second Chechen war in 1999 to the murder in London in 2006 of Kremlin foe Alexander Litvineneko. Cowell's new book about Litvinenko, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/30/crime\">The Terminal Spy</a>, is written against a backdrop of Putin's ruthless rise to an unassailable position at the head of a power structure he remodelled to suit himself.</p> <p>Putin would probably never have become a friend. But his enmity might have been avoided if western leaders had listened more carefully at the beginning. Speaking at the Genoa G8 summit in 2001, Putin said Russia would defend its strategic independence but neither did it pose a threat. He urged the US to maintain the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty and forego missile defence and cooperate instead on constructing new, post-cold war global security structures.</p> <p>Nato's expansion was fuelling insecurity on Europe's edges, he said. Specifically he called for a \"single security and defence space\" in Europe to be created either by replacing Nato or having Russia join it as a full member.</p> <p>He was ignored. And although this in theory is still Russia's position, with Putin and his US counterparts no longer on speaking terms and relations with the west under severe strain, the chance for collaboration has been missed. In Washington a new leader may bring a new approach. But Putin and Putinism, part Bush era collateral damage, part Russian dysfunction, seem set to go on indefinitely.</p>",
  "<p>GDF Suez, the new French energy group, today posted a 20% leap in first-half earnings as it reaffirmed that it had no interest in buying British Energy, the UK's main nuclear power operator.</p> <p>G\u00e9rard Mestrallet, the chief executive, said GDF Suez was keen to be a player in the British nuclear energy market, where the government has been desperately courting another French firm, EDF, to buy British Energy.</p> <p>Announcing pro forma first-half results in Paris, Mestrallet said pre-tax profits rose to \u20ac8.1bn on sales up 17% to \u20ac43bn on the back of soaring demand and high prices.</p> <p>The group, forged in late July from the \u20ac93bn merger of the state-owned gas company GDF with the Franco-Belgian utility Suez, reasserted its target of 10% annual earnings growth to \u20ac17bn by 2010.</p> <p>Mestrallet said the group aimed to invest \u20ac30bn by the end of 2010 and to secure annual cost savings of \u20ac1bn by 2013.</p> <p>The cash-rich group said it would pay its first interim dividend of 80 eurocents, totalling \u20ac1.7bn, in late November and aimed to increase the annual payout by up to 15% a year by 2010, when it would reach more than half of net income. It announced a \u20ac1bn share buyback before the end of 2008.</p> <p>GDF Suez, which is building a 1.9-gigawatt power station on Teesside, has made plain that it wants to operate at least two of the new-generation nuclear power plants planned by the UK government.</p> <p>It already operates seven nuclear stations in Belgium, where it is the biggest energy supplier, trading as Electrabel, and recently sold off a 25.1% stake in rival SPE to Centrica.

  "<p>This week, thousands of children will put on new school uniforms and start their school years in reception. While the children may cope, the new term can be a worrying time for both parents and teachers. Here we offer some advice on how to survive the first day of term.</p> <p><strong>For teachers</strong></p> <p>Know your children. Pupils and parents should have visited the school last term to get an idea of what to expect in reception, and if it's your first year teaching this year group, you should have done too. From these short visits you will have caught a glimpse of the children's likes and dislikes, and picked up on some personality traits. So, come the first day of term you'll have thought of how to distract the child who is likely to cry when mum leaves, and know what will keep the interest of the child who loves building things.</p> <p>Make sure your classroom is set out the way you want it before the class arrives. Make sure all pegs are labelled with a child's name and that you know where everything can be found. Label all your drawers, so pupils know where they can find pens and paper. And know how you are going to group your pupils.</p> <p>Know who should be in your class. Before the first day, check to see if you've any additional pupils who have been assigned a place over the summer, that way you won't be surprised if you have an extra pupil at the start of term, and they won't feel left out if they don't have a peg with their name on.</p> <p>Read all the information that you should have received about your pupils from their pre-school records, to get an idea of how your children work and play with others and if they have any special needs. Speak to professionals who have worked with the children before.</p> <p>Don't flounder - ask for help. It can be daunting when 30 eager little faces are staring up at you in expectation, so if you're feeling the strain, tell someone - speak to your foundation and key stage 1 leader, or your headteacher, who will have been in your shoes and know the pressures.</p> <p>Set up your classroom so it looks like a fun place to be, with bright, lively displays that reflect pupils' interests.</p> <p>Don't be concerned if a child doesn't speak to you on their first day \u2013 they're just sizing you up and will talk to you when they are ready.</p> <p>Expect some pupils to sit with their backs to you when they sit on the carpet, and don't expect them to line up neatly when you take them to assembly for the first time. It's all new to them, so you'll need a little patience.</p> <p>Expect to be asked every five minutes when it will be lunchtime or when they can go home.</p> <p>Don't tell pupils their mums or dads will be back to collect them in five minutes if it's only 9.30am and they won't be collected until lunchtime. Honesty is the best policy, and it will stop them asking why their parents haven't turned up.</p> <p>Make yourself available to parents. Chances are you will have met at least some of your new pupils' parents before the start of term, perhaps when they brought their child into class before the summer break to have a look at what goes on in reception. Often parents are more anxious about the start of school then their children, so you may need to reassure them that their child will be/is happy in class. Be approachable and listen to any concerns parents might have.</p> <p>Get a pet. Not all headteachers are fans, but a pet has proved a useful addition in some classrooms. Not only does a pet offer a much needed distraction to an upset child who doesn't much fancy being at school that day, it also gives children who are unable to have one of their own at home the chance to care for an animal. Two years ago, Clare, a foundation stage and key stage 1 leader at a north London school, brought Ed, a dwarf rabbit, into her reception class. He has proved a hit with her pupils and has calmed disruptive pupils. Year 6 pupils regularly clear out his hutch, the school cook gives him spare cabbages and carrots and parents even buy him snacks from pet shops.</p> <p>Enjoy your class. It's going to be hard work, but make sure you enjoy spending time with the children and make school an enjoyable experience for pupils.</p> <p>Give them until Christmas. It takes a while before all things fall into place, so don't worry if it takes time for children to get used to school.</p> <p><strong>For parents</strong></p> <p>Trust the teachers \u2013 although it will be your child's first time in the classroom, it won't be the first time for their teachers \u2013 including newly qualified teachers, who will have spent a considerable amount of time in class while training - or teaching assistants.</p> <p>Don't spend too long settling your child in. Most schools are happy for parents to come into the classroom to help their child find their coat peg and register, but staying too long may actually unsettle your child or upset those whose parents have already left.</p> <p>Most children will be perfectly happy on their first day of term, so even if you're anxious, try not to let it show, as children can pick up on your feelings.</p> <p>Of course you want to take pictures of your little one dressed in their new school uniform, but try to snap them before or after the school day, rather than as they walk into class. Not only will it be distracting to other pupils, but possibly nerve-wracking for your child who has to pose in front of his or her new classmates.</p> <p>Label everything - 30 grey jumpers look the same, which can make trying to find the one your child has lost difficult if it doesn't have their name written inside.</p> <p>Make sure you pick your child up on time. They may have had a blast on their first day, but they will still want to go home, especially if they see their classmates starting to leave.</p>",

  "<p>Japan's beleaguered prime minister, Yasuo Fukuda, resigned today less than a year after taking office in a shock move that threatens to plunge the world's second-biggest economy into a new round of political turmoil.</p> <p>Faced with poor poll ratings, policy deadlock and mounting economic problems, a grim-faced Fukuda said he had decided several days ago to step down to avoid creating a \"political vacuum\".</p> <p>Fukuda's resignation leaves the door open for Taro Aso, an outspoken rightwinger whom Fukuda made secretary general of the ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) in last month's cabinet reshuffle.</p> <p>At a hastily arranged press conference in Tokyo, Fukuda conceded the reshuffle and the announcement last week of $107bn (\u00a360bn) in extra spending and tax cuts had failed to boost support for his deeply unpopular administration.</p> <p>Faced with an upper house controlled by opposition parties, Fukuda failed to push through key legislation since taking office last September.</p> <p>Opposition parties in the upper house, led by the Democrats, blocked government bills and appointments, including Fukuda's preferred candidate to be governor of the Bank of Japan.</p> <p>Last November, Japanese ships were forced to temporarily withdraw from a refuelling mission in support of US-led forces in Afghanistan after the upper house refused to extend it.</p> <p>After several failed attempts to compromise with the Democrats' leader, Ichiro Ozawa, Fukuda appeared to have lost the stomach for another fight with his former LDP colleague-turned political nemesis.</p> <p>\"The power struggle in parliament has caused me many headaches,\" said Fukuda. \"I have tried to talk things through with the opposition, but they have voted against every single important government bill.</p> <p>\"I want to tell Mr Ozawa that he needs to put the country first, that it would have been better had he and I engaged in an honest dialogue.\"</p> <p>Ozawa, who in June orchestrated a censure motion against Fukuda in the upper house, said this week he would stand for a third term as the Democrats' leader later this month.</p> <p>Speculation that Fukuda would resign mounted after his authority was badly shaken in a row over the timing of the next parliamentary session. He had wanted parliament to meet last month to vote on the Afghanistan refuelling mission. But this was opposed by members of his own party and the LDP's junior partner, New Komeito, who feared the debate would further damage the coalition's standing.</p> <p>The government was also rocked by widespread anger over health insurance reforms that have forced many patients over 75 to pay more for medical treatment.</p> <p>Fukuda's resignation promises to bring yet more political instability to the world's second-biggest economy. His predecessor, Shinzo Abe, resigned one year after taking office due to sagging popularity and poor health.</p> <p>\"We can't allow progress to be stalled further, we must not create a political vacuum,\" he said. \"Policy must be allowed to move forward so I have decided to step down as prime minister. I believe that now is the appropriate time as it will not inconvenience the Japanese people. The Japanese economy and Japanese people's livelihoods are at stake.\"</p> <p>Fukuda admitted depressing poll figures had been a factor in his decision to resign before the next parliamentary session begins on September 12. \"The cabinet's approval rating is an issue. I felt we were on the brink of a political vacuum and, if that were to occur, that it would be very damaging to the Japanese people.\"</p> <p>Despite repeated opposition calls for a snap election, some observers expect the new leader to attempt to rebuild the party's popularity before the next general election is due in September 2009.</p> <p>Analysts said Fukuda had created the very vacuum he was so desperate to avoid. \"This is two prime ministers in a row... the political vacuum will be at least two weeks, more like a month,\" said Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University.</p> <p>\"Nothing will get done. It is quite likely that there will be pressure for the LDP to call an election as soon as possible. Certainly, this is not anything that can be condoned. It is unheard of, even by Japan's standards.\"</p> <p>An opinion poll today showed support for the government was at 29%, despite the launch of the economic stimulus package only days earlier. The same poll said Aso \u2013 the gaffe-prone former foreign minister \u2013 was the most popular choice to be next leader with 26% naming him, compared with just 5% for Fukuda and 8% for Ozawa.</p>",
  "<p>Georgia has admitted dropping cluster bombs during its attempt to regain control of its breakaway province of South Ossetia, a human rights group said today.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch said it had received a letter from the Georgian defence ministry acknowledging the use of M85 cluster bombs near the Roki tunnel that connects South Ossetia with Russia. </p> <p>Georgia launched its ill-fated campaign to retake South Ossetia last month, prompting Russia to invade Georgia and occupy Georgian territory. Human Rights Watch has <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/08/14/georgi19625.htm\">accused Russia of using cluster bombs</a> in populated areas in Georgia, killing at least 11 civilians and injuring dozens.</p> <p>The New York-based group last month called on Russia to immediately stop using cluster bombs, which 100 countries recently agreed to ban.</p> <p>\"Cluster bombs are indiscriminate killers that most nations have agreed to outlaw. Russia's use of this weapon is not only deadly to civilians, but also an insult to international efforts to avoid a global humanitarian disaster of the kind caused by landmines,\" Marc Garlasco, a senior military analyst at Human Rights Watch, said recently.</p> <p>The South Ossetia conflict was the first time cluster bombs were deployed since the Lebanon war in 2006, when M85s were used extensively by Israel against Hizbullah.</p> <p>Cluster munitions, which contain dozens or hundreds of smaller submunitions or bomblets, have been condemned because of their capacity to kill and maim civilians. Many do not immediately explode, causing civilian casualties for months or years to come. </p> <p>In May, 107 nations agreed to a total ban on cluster munitions, but Russia did not take part in the talks. Russia was not part of the Oslo process launched in February 2007 to develop a new international treaty banning cluster munitions. </p> <p>The convention on cluster munitions agreed in May comprehensively bans the use, production, trade and stockpiling of the weapon. It will be open for signature in Oslo on December 3.</p>",
  "<h2>1. Camping with chickens</h2> <p>\"Would you like to come camping with us, Granny?\" Would I like ... just hand me the tent peg. J packs for all contingencies, everything but the laptop. We squashed ourselves and the overflowing bags of toys, food, wine, rugs, blankets and tea lights (with lamps) into the car and set off.<br> Luckily, we weren't going far. Manor Court Farm is on the A264 just west of the village of Stone Cross on the edge of the High Weald and is a well-appointed campsite with one small field and a number of individual sites. Ours was chosen for the setting sun because L said they would need all the light they could get to pitch their new tent. It took them a long time as they hadn't had a practice run. It is the biggest tent I've ever seen, probably bigger than the old army tents I remember from my Girl Guide days. I probably should have agreed to them buying me inflatable mattress, the ageing bones groaned a bit I must admit, but fresh air is the best sedative. It was all so beautifully bucolic to dusty townies like us. Our chosen location alongside the imposing Kent barn really belonged to the chickens and they spent all day scratching around. We were all a little disconcerted by the profligacy of the males. \"He's just a bully,\" we explained to E as the Buff Orpington had his cocky way three times in as many minutes. But we loved them all the same.  One evening L and I were collecting kindling for the campfire. A roe deer emerged from the wood, less than ten metres away. As he spotted us he bolted across the wheatfield closely followed by his dark little mate. Wildlife watching was mandatory after that.</p> <p>There were tart little Morello cherries on the adjacent site. When the neighbours went off for the day we would climb over the fence and gorge ourselves. E picked immature apples but she's only seven; I had no excuse to pick cobnuts which should have been left on the tree to ripen.<br> I managed to record the chickens on my phone before we left and now have a raucous reminder of the trip as my ringtone. I'm going to buy an inflatable bed for the next trip.</p> <p><strong>Carmen Davies, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire </strong></p> <h2>2. A tale of two valleys: wild camping in the Lake District</h2> <p>Every weekend between April and October, people swarm to the Lake District and its myriad attractions. Campsites book up months in advance, spilling over with families, dogs, barbecues and guy ropes; crossing the field to join a toilet queue becomes an SAS-style mission. Fortunately, there are endless opportunities for wild camping \u2013 pitching your tent in the wilderness, miles from anyone else. Determined to watch the sun set without a Frisbee flying across it, I stuffed my rucksack with noodles and cereal bars and headed for Troutbeck Valley.</p> <p>My train arrives at Windermere late afternoon, when most walkers are trudging down from the summits. This is a well-known wild camping trick; just 30 minutes later on Orrest Head (an easy 238m ascent), there is no one to disturb the views across Windermere and the golds and russets of the fells provide the perfect backdrop for people enjoying England's largest natural lake from their rowing boats. </p> <p>Heading deeper into Troutbeck Valley along the Garburn track, the trickle of evening walkers dries up completely. As dusk settles, I pitch my brand new tent on the grassy flanks of Ill Bell alone \u2013 the Lake District to myself at last. Some inquisitive sheep wander over to see what's happening, unused to intruders disturbing their peace at this time of day. The setting sun sends soft purple shadows across the silent valley, and the scent of wild grass and bracken just overpowers the smell of damp boots. </p> <p>By 7am the next morning, I'm heading north towards Stony Cove Pike. The plan is to head towards Helvellyn and wild camp near Red Tarn. Three glorious hours pass before meeting the first walker of the day. By mid morning, the crowds are out in force, jockeying for position around the famous Fairfield horseshoe. And ever more they come; on Helvellyn, after the 200th \"hello\" of the day, my good spirits are in dangerously short supply \u2013 the solitude of a wild camp can't come soon enough.</p> <p>'Closing Time' syndrome strikes again as the sun goes down, and the fells are soon deserted apart from a few stragglers carefully descending Swirral Edge. Dark clouds are gathering, though, and neither my new tent nor tired limbs fancy a cold, soggy night on higher ground, so I head into Grisedale Valley to look for shelter. Some hope. As the winds pick up and the clouds explode, the tent starts playing games \u2013 there hadn't been this many poles last night, surely? </p> <p>But 10 minutes later, the stove is bubbling and the boots are off. I sit in the small porch to watch the storm unleash its fury on Patterdale and Ullswater. And there's no better way to enjoy the Lake District than sheltered by canvas with a whole valley to yourself, whether it's lit up by lightning or a sunset. </p> <p><strong>Tim Woods, Brighton </strong></p> <h2>3. Roughing it in the Highlands</h2> <p>Outside our tent, beside a river in the thick of Abernethy Forest, I caught my tentmate in the act of city-slicking. \"I thought we were roughing it,\" I said. He swirled his razor in the river and replied, \"Shaving in freezing water is pretty rough.\" Shaving while camping? He packed up his toiletries, each in a separate Tupperware, and carried his pack from our ensuite river to our self-catering fire ring, to unpack a camping stove. \"I thought we were packing light,\" I said, but I had lost him to a tin of rice pudding.</p> <p>I had imagined that we would somehow not be modern consumers. Highlanders would eat their oatmeal cold, carried in sporrans around their waists, and held in their fists under water until it was soft. In the distance, in the Cairngorm mountains, I saw the clouds were climbing up the west of one Munro and falling down the east of another. Through the smog of midges, I saw the orange branches of a Scots pine, catching the morning light and putting it to work in sugar factories inside its needles. Nature was opening for business, and I wondered what my business in it was. </p> <p>Horrified, my tentmate asked, \"Are you wearing mascara?\" My face was covered in Deet, but my eyes were an open target, and many a midge had apparently died, trying to get into them. Their corpses were piling up in my eyelashes, lining my eyes like mascara. I suddenly felt grateful for the Deet, and I settled into a tin of cooked breakfast, accepting my place in all this as a modern consumer.</p> <p>Good thing I did, because guilt will not preserve the wildernesses of the world, but our enjoyment of them could do. Having given up my guilt, I got to see what I had come to see \u2014 the beauty of the native Caledonian pinewoods. Walking underneath their blue-green needles, through diffuse and purple light, did not disappoint.</p> <p>From Aviemore, a local bus gets you to Glenmore, where you either settle at the friendly youth hostel (if the sky is being pouty) or else at the densely packed, manicured campsite, across the road. Or, you walk to Abernethy Forest or into the pinewoods, and there you camp wild, because (unlike the rest of Britain) wild camping is legal in Scotland. </p> <p>Oh, and you know how, wherever you travel, they tell you not to drink the water? Well, I was suffering under the weight of a bottle of store-bought, when a ranger waylaid me to recommend I empty it, because the water of the lochs and wee burns is potable. Potable? I bet animals pee in those lochs and wee burns, but still it seemed an antidote to city-slicking, and so I drank. The runs and I have not crossed paths.</p> <p><strong>Gorm Shackelford, Camberwell, London</strong></p> <h2>4) Climbing Suilven, Scotland</h2> <p>\"But you know I hate water!\" stormed Mac. Too late to tell me that now. We were halfway across an enormous loch, the water black and jumpy with aggressive waves, which threw spray into our faces and fear into our stomachs. Inexperienced canoeists both, we were headed for the elusive mountain of Suilven, invisible over hills to our left, and were only half an hour into a challenging - some might say foolhardy - two-day journey.<br> In the back of the car was some ill-assorted camping gear, along with an inflatable canoe - until this point used solely for messing around on the canal on a calm summer's day. Suilven, our mythical destination, rises from the Coigach peninsula, in the far north-west of Scotland, sheer and improbable, like the helmet of an old-fashioned bobby, from a flat and watery landscape. Dominating the surrounding lochs and moorland, the mountain seems to shape-change and colour-change at will, occasionally a surprising pink, often disappearing completely.</p> <p>This was our chance to get closer. Earlier that morning, after a brackeny night in a one-and-a-quarter-man tent, we had pushed off from the shore, our rucksacks between our knees. Paddling hard into a sharp wind, out into the vastness of the open water, the panic reached its peak, but just when it all began to seem like a hideous, life-threatening mistake, we rounded an island and found ourselves in calmer water.<br> The midges attacked, till we masochistically rubbed sand into our skin, abandoned the canoe, demolished the chocolate and started inland, wading through hip-high heather, jumping streams and glimpsing the occasional backside of a deer. Hours later we pitched the tent on a patch of close-cropped grass. I heated some glutinous soup, Mac triumphantly produced a bottle of red wine, and we contemplated the enormous, people-less landscape around us. Then, astonishingly, the clouds thinned and Suilven appeared, immense above us, so that we had to strain our necks to look up at it. We slept well that night, under the mountain, warmed by Rioja and our exertions.</p> <p>In the morning we scrambled up the steep slope and edged along the jagged ridge. Between veils of cloud, the landscape lay below us like a map, and we traced the journey we'd made. Quinag was there, and Canisp, and in the north the headlands stacked up towards Cape Wrath. But the weather was closing in. Unceremoniously I slid down the scree on the seat of my trousers.</p> <p>By the time we'd made it back, we were too knackered to even mutter. But a few miles down the single-track road was the <a href=\"http://www.summerisleshotel.co.uk\">Summer Isles Hotel</a> in Achiltibuie. Pitching our tent haphazardly on the beach outside, we made for the bar where, dazedly and delightedly, feeling like strangers to civilisation, we ordered celebratory plates of seafood while the feeling coursed back into our toes.</p> <p><strong>Natasha Lewer, London</strong></p> <h2>Monarch of the Glencoe campsite, Scotland</h2> <p>\"Right Pop, this is what I want to do for my 40th.\"</p> <p>\"Oh?\" I said, ready to flinch, used as I am to my son's madcap schemes.</p> <p>\"I want to go to Glencoe \u2013 camping. I fancy doing Aonach Eagach.\"</p> <p>I breathed a sigh of relief. I had many fond memories of that part of the world; most recently a cycle tour with my wife and many years ago as a 17-year-old just before my A levels.</p> <p>\"Fantastic.\"</p> <p>So over a weekend in August myself, my son Pev (don't ask), his partner Sheila and their four-month-old son, Tom, along with 20-something of his friends from around the country converged on the Red Squirrel campsite just outside the village of Glencoe.</p> <p>We set up camp and, without any reference to Ray Mears, prioritised tasks. Saturday evening came, the camp was complete and, as twilight gathered, the first fire of the holiday was lit. People drifted from their tents to sit around; some with blankets and food ready for the long haul, some with candles or incense sticks; some came ready for anything, armed with a bottle of whiskey and a Swiss Army knife.</p> <p>Then, by the warm flickering light, when all was quiet except for the crackle of the fire and the murmur of conversation, Luke, on harmonica, and Nick and Liam on guitar struck up. Choruses rose and fell from the glowing circle of people. The night was clear and starlit, with the occasional shooting star, and the overall effect was nothing short of magical.</p> <p>I could go on to describe how, owing to the fickleness of the British weather, the site turned into a swamp the following day; or to complain about the mighty Scottish midge; or to tell you how we laughed when Jim fell into a raging torrent. And I could \u2013 but no, on second thoughts, I couldn't - describe and do justice to the grandeur, the sheer beauty of this place. But the special joy of the whole weekend lies in those times around the camp \u2013 the camaraderie, the sharing, the pleasure in old friendships renewed, the laughter and for me, the happiness of sharing it all with my eldest son.</p> <p><strong>Frank Evans</strong></p>",
  "<p>Now you can take that round-the-world trip from the comfort of your home, and see not just the obvious tourist sites but people having parties or playing with their kids in the back garden. All you need is a web browser and <a href=\"http://www.earthalbum.com/\">Earth Album \u2013 an online photo album that covers the whole world</a>. </p> <p>Earth Album doesn't actually have any of its own photos, of course: it takes them from Flickr, the popular photo-sharing website. Nor does it have a map of the world: it uses Google Maps with a hybrid satellite view. What Earth Album does is take these two giant internet properties and link them together in what's called a mashup.</p> <p>It's easy to use. You start with a map of the world and zoom in on the area you want. Earth Album takes any Flickr photos associated with that place \u2013 perhaps by geotagging \u2013 and displays them in a scrolling strip across the screen. You can click on any photo to see a larger version, along with its caption, if it has one.</p> <p>The results vary according to what's available. If you focus on a small or desolate region you may not find anything. Zooming out increases the chance of finding at least a few images, and the country-level views have some stunning images. The major cities and tourist spots are well covered, as you'd expect, but some areas are very badly served. Google Maps' coverage of Georgia, for example, is poor, and it can be hard to find many photos except for Tbilisi.</p> <p>There are shortcuts, and you can find a place by typing in the name or entering an address. If you want London Ontario, Paris Texas or Boston Lincs, you have to be specific. Curiously, York takes you to New York instead of the city in Yorkshire.</p> <p>You can also search by keywords and find things like mountains and sunsets. In this case, Earth Album seems to be picking up cues from titles and captions.</p> <p>There are one or two annoyances. The main one for me is the scrolling of the picture selection. This works well as you go from right to left, bringing up more photos, but clicking the left arrow takes you right back to the beginning. This seems bizarre on a site that has been around for two years.</p> <p>A very minor complaint is that there should be a more obvious way to jump from any photo to its home on Flickr (clicking the title works). Flickr often gives you the background to a picture, and access to a stream of related images. </p> <p>Earth Album's results may seem somewhat voyeuristic, because they can include personal snaps taken at parties and weddings, at work, at home or in pubs. On the other hand, it's interesting to see the same sort of snaps from Santiago, Singapore, Sapporo and similar places. In the end, Earth Album is giving us the chance to see and share our common humanity, and that must be a force for good.</p>",

  "<p><br>Not much anarchy in the UK... the punk movement has moved to pastures new. Photograph: Getty</p> <p>Hang out at a UK punk gig today and you'd be hard pushed to describe what you see as anything other than some good old harmless fun in a genre that long since became another subsidiary of rock 'n' roll.</p> <p>While punk has produced its fair share of careerists, traditionalists and spotty herberts, let's not forget it has produced a few genuinely provocative bands, from the MC5 and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPIpputRkJU&amp;feature=related\">Crass</a> to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGJFWirQ3ks&amp;feature=related\">Fugazi</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqVL3FeIvno\">Refused</a>. But that was then, this is now and it's easy to forget that punk still means something - and I don't mean your drunk Uncle Terry or that bloke who still hangs around the town centre in his Angelic Upstarts T-shirts. Instead, the spirit of punk as an anti-establishment force lives on today. You're just not likely to find it in the UK or the US. </p> <p>Instead, punk is kept alive in places like Cuba where simply criticising the communist regime can get your ass thrown in jail. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/cuba.humanrights\">As has been reported</a>, that's what has happened to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gr4QyjwgMNU\">Gorki \u00c1guila Carrasco</a>, leader singer of <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/PornoparaRicardo\">Porno para Ricardo</a>, currently facing four years in prison for \"peligrosidad\" - literally meaning the dangerousness of his music - specifically for dismissing the ruling Castro brothers as \"geriatrics\". It's hardly <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/music/2008/05/does_rock_get_any_more_extreme.html\">GG Allin</a> is it? Maybe it was their vaguely wacky song 'El Comandante' that upset, um, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro\">El Comandante</a>.</p> <p>Elsewhere the appetite for punk rock grows unabated. Readers of Marjane Satrapi's graphic novel Persepolis or its <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znSU-cNIJ2A\">film adaptation</a> will know the type of trouble faced when caught with contraband punk music under the theocratic tyranny of Islamist fundamentalists in post-revolution Iran. And indeed, how that hunger for anti-social sounds merely grows when challenged. The Sex Pistols might be a joke today, but for millions of oppressed youth they still represent a signpost to freedom.</p> <p>The perceived controversial nature of punk bands merely highlights the conservative world we're living in, where fundamentalist religious regimes or paranoid governments still perceive punk bands as threatening. Just ask Canadian punk band <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/428064\">The Suicide Pilots</a>, who have a government file on them for their name alone. Or ask leading Chinese punk band Hang On The Box, who have previously been denied visas to travel abroad after their government deemed their music an \"inappropriate\" export. Punk scenes exist in China, but bands have to tread carefully and make sure not to criticise their government. \"We are good citizens who obey the law and love our country,\" said Li Qing of Chinese punk band Snapline, when asked about governmental intervention when <a href=\"http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?Itemid=34&amp;id=459&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view\">interviewed in 2007</a>. And do you know how hard it is locating a Gang Of Four record in North Korea?</p> <p>Even UK punks aren't immune - when Mike Devine, guitarist with a Clash tribute band, texted his friend some lyrics from The Clash's 'Tommy Gun' the father of two was <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/3773349.stm\">paid a visit</a> by the Avon &amp; Somerset Special Branch.</p> <p>Ultimately, though, Western punk has got soft and largely apolitical thanks to us living in one of the freest countries in the world. Punk in America and Britain is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRIHr63QOuY\">John Lydon selling computer games</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSJNSHJOroE\">Green Day filling stadiums</a>. But if you think punk - the spirit of punk - is dead, go to South America, go to Russia, go to Eastern Europe and see what the young punk fans there have to say about it.</p>",
  "<p>The MDC's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/27/zimbabwe\">booing and jeering</a> of Robert Mugabe as he gave his opening address at parliament was ill-advised. Sure, it will have delighted the western media, but it made the MDC look like boozers' league rejects, rather than a supposed government-in-waiting.</p> <p>It could be argued that Mugabe has earned the right to his public barracking. But, as we watched the MDC performance, one thought ran through every Zimbabwean's mind; if this is how they behave now, what would they be like in power? Certainly, Mugabe was humiliated, but so too was the new speaker of the house of assembly, the MDC's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/26/zimbabwe\">Lovemore Moyo</a>, whose fundamental task is to preserve the dignity of parliament, and create an enabling environment for serious discussion.</p> <p>Tuesday's noise factory could have consequences. First, it will give plentiful ammunition to Zanu-PF hardliners. They have been insisting that Mugabe must retain executive power in any deal with the opposition MDC. Now they will be saying that the MDC is an immature opposition, and will pressure Mugabe to form a cabinet as quickly as possible. Second, it will give the hard men another excuse to crack down, and unleash the eager, voracious predators from within the war veterans, Central Intelligence Organisation, police and army. There will likely be a new wave of arrests and beatings as they try to avenge their humiliation, and prevent MDC MPs from taking their seats, particularly when there is debate over major legislation. Third, it will make the speaker's job that much harder. Zanu-PF will not believe that Moyo was not part of the heckling, and he will have a real task on his hands to maintain order in the house when parliament reconvenes in October.</p> <p>This parliament could be the most important since <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1998/12/98/zimbabwe/226542.stm\">independence</a>. The combination of the MDC's slight majority in the lower house and ownership of the speaker's chair, means that should Mugabe fully <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/27/zimbabwe1\">form a cabinet</a>, it will not be done with parliamentary approval, and it will be impossible for Zanu-PF, and President Mbeki, to \"sell\" any new cabinet as the legitimate representatives of the Zimbabwean people.</p> <p>But Zanu-PF will fire all manner of legal salvoes in its determination to retain legitimacy; and for the state, the much-abused constitution is always the heavy artillery. According to the constitution, 180 days is the maximum period allowed between official sittings of parliament \u2013 hence the reopening of parliament. Furthermore, once parliament is in session, a cabinet must be formed as soon as possible. Zanu-PF also insists that the <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200807230758.html\">memorandum of understanding</a>, which explicitly forbids the reconvening of parliament and the appointment of a new cabinet without the approval of all the negotiatory parties, is not a binding contract. The legal tussles between the parties will run and run. However, the perennial questions about MDC strategy remain: for them to petition Mbeki on the illegality of the current parliament, whilst participating in that same parliament, is nonsensical. You cannot have your <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadza\">sadza</a> and eat it. If they are really opposed to this sitting of parliament, then they should have boycotted the proceedings entirely.</p> <p>The real significance of this parliament is that it could revive the meaning of that institution. It usually rubber-stamps ruling-party legislation, but Zimbabwe's parliament is far from being a broken institution. Even post-2000, there have been serious legislative debates. The expectation is that, at the very least, the new parliament will provide a forum for robust debate, and reintroduce the principle of executive accountability. Having a speaker in the lower house will empower the MDC there; the senate president is from Zanu-PF, and it will dominate the upper house. So, there will likely be a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/12/zimbabwe.africanunion\">zero-sum game in parliament</a>, as each side tries to block the other. The great danger for the MDC is that it will be tempted to block everything. This would backfire, because Zanu-PF would retaliate in kind. The MDC must grasp, and quickly, that this is its chance to show that it is serious. If it wants to be seen as credible, then it must oppose the seductions of a perennial \"no\". Sometimes, it will need to flirt with \"yes\".</p> <p>Ultimately, the two sides will have to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/17/zimbabwe\">work together</a>. The constitution has been used and abused by Zanu-PF, and there have been highly repressive amendments and new bills passed. The opposition should scrutinise all legislation, but it should never forget its duty of care to the Zimbabwean people. Not all the legislation passed in parliament has been villainous, and whilst the MDC should oppose repressive legislation, it should work with Zanu-PF to pass constructive bills. The public finance management bill, the energy laws amendment bill, the older persons bill, the education bill; and the construction industry council bill, all of which are to be tabled in the new parliament, are actually of sound intent. These may be bills on which all sides can do business. The <a href=\"http://kubatana.net/html/archive/legisl/070925ieebamd.asp?sector=LEGISL&amp;year=0&amp;range_start=1\">national indigenisation and empowerment bill</a>, on the other hand, will be highly contentious. The ministerial budgets will become major battlegrounds, as will the constitution itself.</p> <p>There's the possibility that Mugabe may close parliament and rule by decree. Assuming that parliament does remain open for business, the danger is that it will become nihilistic, with no cooperation at all between the parties, and even the good legislation being buried along with the bad. If the political antagonists are mature, they will not allow the stalled political negotiations to contaminate parliament; indeed it is all the more imperative that parliament functions. The battles for power between and within Zanu-PF, and the two MDCs (and possible breakaway groups) will continue.</p> <p>There will be all kinds of political horse-trading, making and breaking of deals, and crossing the floor, in this session of parliament. That is to be expected; but millions of suffering Zimbabweans also expect results, and apart from being an arena of political jousting, parliament should now enable constructive legislation which benefits ordinary Zimbabweans. The MDC needs to drop its \"Parliament is illegal \u2013 we want no part of it\" whinging and get on with the job of delivering the constructive change they have promised. Zanu-PF also has to realise that the days of a rubber-stamp parliament and getting legislation passed through the back-door are over.</p>",
  "<p>Scandal - and not for the first time - in <strong>Wikipedia</strong>land, where freshly minted <strong>Republican</strong> party vice-presidential candidate <strong>Sarah Palin</strong> had some very flattering edits made to her <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_palin\">profile</a> in the 24 hours before she was nominated.</p> <p><br><br>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/notionscapital/2811062657/\">Mike Licht, NotionsCapital.com</a> on Flickr. Some <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en_GB\">rights reserved</a>.</p> <p>Someone using the handle <strong>YoungTrigg</strong> - perhaps not coincidentally the name of the youngest of her five children - made 30 mostly edits to the page, including that she \"would sometimes wake at 3 a.m. to hunt moose before school\" and that, as Alaskan governor, she had \"kept her campaign promises, reducing her own salary, as well as reducing property taxes 60%.\"<br></p> <p>Most of the information was taken from a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Sarah-Hockey-Alaskas-Political-Establishment/dp/0979047080/ref=/ref=cm_cd_f_pb_i\">recent biography</a>, but the sceptical among you might wonder how this supporter managed such a timely and flattering update of Palin's profile before the world knew she was <strong>John McCain</strong>'s running mate. Is YoungTrigg a Republican campaigner?</p> <p>On the night before the announcement, another editor changed Palin's profile to say she was McCain's candidate. YoungTrigg posted a note saying: \"Where did you hear that Palin was the VP nominee? I can't find anything online.\" The conspiracy theorists think that was a red herring.<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/01/technology/01link.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;adxnnlx=1220259707-EF5e165pZYyZb8u877rEuA\">New York Times</a> spoke to an anonymous lawyer and regular Wikipedia editor who had gone over YoungTrigg's entries and toning down partial material.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"A lot of stuff was useful -- like citing a biography of her,\" he said in a telephone interview, speaking under condition of anonymity to avoid tipping off his clients that he spends time on Wikipedia. \"Some was questionable stuff.\" In general, he said, the editing \"indicates a very close familiarity with Governor Palin.\"</p> <p>\"The lawyer said that when YoungTrigg linked to government documents on a government Web site related to the trooper case, it seemed like this editor was not exactly a political na\u00eff.</p> <p>\"But, he says, this person may be Wikipedically na\u00efve. \"They didn't quite know what they were getting into -- they got a lot of conflict-of-interest notes,\" he said. And much of that original, flattering material has been overwritten.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>As of today, YoungTrigg is on Wikipedia's list of users to be checked. The Wikipedia <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser#youngtrigg\">log</a> says:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"This is a new user since August 28, 2008 who has edited only the Sarah Palin page. Sarah Palin was selected by McCain as his VP the next day after the entry was gone over and sanitized. The edits have a partisan POV and are extensive. The edits evidence some familiarity with wikipedia, more than might be expected for a new user. The discussion of the edits is currently a recommended diary on the Daily KOS. If this user turns out to be someone connected to Sarah Palin it violates Wikipedia's conflict of interest rules.\"<br></p> </blockquote> <p>But we may never know; YoungTrigg's user information has now disappeared from Wikipedia, following a short spell with the label 'retired' next to his or her profile.

(co-written with Chris Langham) - an eight-hour epic based on an American sci-fi trilogy - was the first production in the National Theatre's Cottesloe auditorium, with a prologue spoken by John Gielgud. His official posts included a brief spell as artistic director of the Liverpool Everyman in 1980 and a professorship in ventriloquism at Rada.</p> <p>He was first renowned in the early 1970s for the Ken Campbell Road Show, in which a company including Bob Hoskins, Jane Wood, Andy Andrews, Dave Hill and Sylvester McCoy (\"The Human Bomb\") enacted barroom tales of sexual and psychic mayhem while banging nails up their noses and stuffing ferrets down their trousers.</p> <p>Even more remarkable than Illuminatus! was his 10-play (22-hour) hippy extravaganza, The Warp (1979), a sort of acid Archers co-written with the poet Neil Oram. The protagonist's search for his own female consciousness took him from 15th-century Bavaria to a flying-saucer conference in 1968. Bill Nighy and Jim Broadbent were among the cast of unknowns; characters included Turkish policemen, Chinese officials, Buckminster Fuller, clowns, fire-eaters, military art enthusiasts, a raging landlord (\"I don't have any friends; just different classes of enemy\") and a comic postman.</p> <p>The Warp - subsequently revived as a rave-music production near London Bridge by Ken's daughter, Daisy Campbell - was followed in 1980 with a magnificent hoax which seemed to encapsulate the challenge of \"What next?\" The theatre world was flooded with invitations from Trevor Nunn to come aboard the newly formed Royal Dickens Company in the wake of the RSC's hugely successful Nicholas Nickleby; Shakespeare was being dropped for Dickens, and offers were made on meticulously reproduced company notepaper, all apparently signed by Nunn (\"Love, Trev\").</p> <p>Nunn's embarrassment was compounded by the fact that a lot of people had written back to him refusing, or even more disconcertingly, accepting his gushing \"offers\" of work on Snoo Wilson's Little Dorrit or Michael Bogdanov's equally specious Sketches By Boz. After a couple of weeks of panic and speculation in the press, Campbell owned up.<br>There have been few stranger people in Britain, let alone the theatre, than Campbell. Living in a Swiss chalet in Epping Forest, he trained his three black crossbreed dogs - Max, Gertie and Bear - to win prizes, made art work from the random droppings of a parrot called Doris and entertained his visitors with the films of Jackie Chan, the martial arts film star whom he regarded as the greatest living actor.</p> <p>This irrepressibly jovial elf, with a thin streak of malicious devilry about him - he was Puck, hobgoblin - was in recent years most widely known for his own wild and wonderful one-man shows, which embodied the quality of \"friskajolly younkerkins\" that Kenneth Tynan, quoting the Tudor poet John Skelton, ascribed to Ralph Richardson's famously hedonistic, twinkling postwar Falstaff. He gave up \"serious\" acting when he realised he was enjoying what everyone else was doing too much, although he did appear in a takeover cast in Yasmina Reza's Art at the Wyndham's theatre in 2000.</p> <p>On television he appeared memorably as a bent lawyer in GF Newman's Law and Order series (1978) and in one episode of Fawlty Towers. He was Warren Mitchell's neighbour, Fred Johnson, in the sitcom In Sickness and in Health. He popped up bizarrely in films such as A Fish Called Wanda (1988) and Derek Jarman's The Tempest (1979), very much the same persona, bursting at the confines of a role and never quite fitting another scheme of show business.</p> <p>With a gimlet eye and a pair of bushy eyebrows that had lately outgrown even Denis Healey's and acquired advanced canopy status, Campbell was a perennial reminder of the rough-house origins of the best of British theatre, from Shakespeare, music hall and Joan Littlewood to the fringe before it became fashionable, tame and subsidised.</p> <p>When Richard Eyre presented Campbell's Bendigo, a raucous vaudeville about a legendary prizefighter, at the Nottingham Playhouse in 1976, he thought it was one of the most enjoyable things he had ever seen in a theatre (so did I). \"Most of Campbell's capers,\" said Eyre, \"look as if they are going to be follies and turn out to be inspired gestures of showmanship.\"</p> <p>He had pursued improvisation as a goal in itself in recent years, and had just returned from the Edinburgh Fringe, where he supervised the fleshing out in performance of shows that had no existence whatsoever except in the columns of fictitious reviews written by critics on national newspapers.</p> <p>I saw an example of this style of riotous work in Cambridge in 2005, when I watched Campbell conduct an inspired improvisational contest in the English faculty between a group of undergraduates and a quartet of visiting Liverpudlian actors. In a sort of Whose Line Is It Anyway? format, Campbell set the tasks, or took suggestions from the audience. We had cod Shakespeare, the Eurovision song contest, enemies seeing each other in a museum, simultaneous singing and \"German\" acting.<br>Ken Campbell was born in Ilford, Essex, the only son of Colin Campbell, a Liverpudlian Irishman who worked for ITT, the commercial cable company, and his wife Elsie. He was educated at Gearies primary school in Barkingside and Chigwell school. While at Rada he also appeared with the renowned Renegades, an amateur group in Ilford run by one of Campbell's earliest heroes, James Cooper, who also played the leading roles, painted the sets, manned the box office and talked a lot about No\u00ebl Coward.</p> <p>He was hired by the comedian Dick Emery as his stooge on tour and had a pot of coffee tipped into his lap for daring to gain an unscripted laugh. \"I'm the comedian around here,\" said an incensed Emery, as he poured it. In 1964 he was understudying Warren Mitchell in the West End and showed him a script called Events of an Average Bath Night. Mitchell arranged for a performance, in which he appeared, at Rada. This started him off as playwright, and his Old King Cole (1967) for Peter Cheeseman - another early champion - at Stoke has proved a children's classic.</p> <p>A chance encounter with Lindsay Anderson led to his key, reactive association with the Royal Court in 1969. He tasted failure as a junior director and decided to change tack completely. He heard that a benefactor at the Bolton Octagon was sponsoring a small \"road show\" team to spread the good word of the theatre locally. He put in for the job, got it, then broke away from the Octagon. The Road Show brought him back to the Court (Anderson invited them into the Theatre Upstairs) and established his place on the fringe at the first peak of its creativity in the early 1970s.</p> <p>With another eccentric self-dramatiser, Ion Alexis Will, he wrote The Great Caper (1974), about a search across Europe and the Lapland tundra for the Perfect Woman. The practitioners he now most admired were not the career directors of the day but the liberated, liberating American companies like the Living Theatre, who had appeared at the Roundhouse, and the improvisational group Theatre Machine, whose work was based on the teaching of Keith Johnstone, an assistant director at the Court.</p> <p>When Eyre took over the Nottingham Playhouse, Campbell wrote not only Bendigo but also Walking Like Geoffrey, an inspired piece of vaudevillian hokum based on the local legend of people disporting themselves in a lunatic fashion in order to avoid paying taxes. Eyre also cast Campbell as Knock'em the horse-courser in Bartholomew Fair and Subtle in The Alchemist; never was an actor more perfectly equipped for the wild excesses and linguistic relish in rare Ben Jonson.</p> <p>By the end of the 1980s, Campbell's interests in trepanning, teleportation, synchronicity and the Jungian concept of archetypes were fuelling a new career as a solo artist, stitched into a dizzyingly seductive form of theatrical monologue that he delivered in his trademark nasal whine, rocking dangerously on the balls of his feet.</p> <p>Campbell's three monodramas \u2013 Recollections of a Furtive Nudist, Pigspurt and Jamais Vu at the National in 1993 \u2014 were subtitled \"The Bald Trilogy\" because the (David) Hare trilogy was playing next door in the larger Olivier auditorium. They contain some of the most exciting and entertaining writing for the stage in the past 30 years, on a par with many sections of The Warp, and they won the Evening Standard Best Comedy Award.</p> <p>He was gloriously on form again in I'm Not Mad: I've Just Read Different Books! (2005), a multiple adventure of some time-travelling cave-dwellers near Turin, a visit to Jeremy Beadle's library, his career as a speaker at pet funerals in Ilford, and a demonstration of real \"gastromantic\" acting (this involves a lot of arse, as opposed to voice, projection; what Judi Dench does, apparently, is merely \"dramatic portrayal\"). His heroes included the sci-fi writer Philip K Dick, the Hollywood script fixer Robert McKee and Ken Dodd. His enthusiasms were legion and unshakeable; a maniacal telephone call in the small hours was both a dread and a joy for many of his friends.</p> <p>Campbell met his wife, the actor Prunella Gee, when she appeared in Illuminatus! They married in 1978, and although they subsequently divorced, they remained close. He is survived by Gee, their daughter Daisy, a writer and director, and two grandchildren, Dixie and Django.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ken Campbell, writer, director and actor, born December 10 1941; died August 31 2008</p>",
  "<p><br> Utter authenticity ... a scene from Barbet Schroeder's Inju, the Beast in the Shadow</p> <p>Many in Japan are appalled by the way that westerners have portrayed geishas in movies. Apparently, Rob Marshall's Memoirs of a Geisha is considered the absolute nadir, not least because it cast a Chinese actress in one of the leading roles. \"It is a real offence to them because they (the Japanese) are very proud of that heritage,\" says film-maker Barbet Schroeder. \"The idea that someone comes along and doesn't even try to understand that heritage and hires Chinese people ...\"</p> <p>Schroeder (whose new Japanese-set thriller Inju, the Beast in the Shadow has just premiered at the Venice festival) was determined to portray geisha culture in his film as exactly as possible. With this in mind, in the run-up to production, he spent as much time meeting geishas as possible.</p> <p>\"Of course, before this movie, I couldn't afford to meet with a geisha because it is extremely difficult and expensive. They don't accept just anybody coming in,\" Schroeder (whose other credits include Reversal of Fortune, Single White Female and Terror's Advocate) notes. Apparently, the going rate for an evening in a geisha's company is between five and ten thousand dollars - more than even a filmmaker of Schroeder's stature can normally afford.</p> <p>The first geisha Schroeder met was a 60-year-old who was running a teahouse in Kanzawa and instructing young would-be geishas. \"She was interesting because she was not part of the central [geisha] tradition which is in Kyoto. She had ways that were a little different. She was very human, very simple and I could relate to her wonderfully although we were communicating through an interpreter.\"</p> <p>Schroeder compares her to a Buddhist monk - \"somebody with this wonderful presence in the moment, this wonderful smile. You feel it right away that she is somebody completely with you in the moment. She was past 60 but she was still beautiful, with an extreme elegance and a lightness in speaking. She talked about life and death but always with irony and lightness.\"</p> <p>Put it to Schroeder that geishas are exploited and that they lead often forlorn lives (an impression that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenji_Mizoguchi\">Mizoguchi's films</a> certainly give) and the director demurs. \"It is not really a sad life. It is a society of women who are in control of their destiny,\" Schroeder says. \"These are people who are living cultural monuments.\"</p> <p>Inju, the Beast in the Shadow is a bold but arguably misguided affair. Adapted from a novel by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rampo_Edogawa\">Edogawa Rampo</a> (the Edgar Allan Poe of Japanese literature), it is pitched somewhere between a B-thriller and Nagisa Oshima's In the Realm of the Senses. Corny plot twists, transgressive sex and self-reflexive asides about cinema sit side by side. Many in Venice found it preposterous and it was given a rough ride by the volatile Italian press. Nonetheless, there is one level on which it was beyond criticism. Schroeder is adamant that he has represented geisha culture (or, as the Japanese prefer to call it, \"geiko\" culture) in a way that no Japanese audience can find fault with.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> London. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> James Yuill (voice, guitar, computer).<br> <strong>The background:</strong> There is a joke about two acts comprising a scene and three constituting a movement. We don't actually know the joke but we do know there is a group of young singer-songwriters out there using acoustic guitars as well as computer technology to express themselves and convey their heartfelt messages. We can even name names: Jeremy Warmsley, Dan Deacon, Ben Esser, Rod Thomas and now James Yuill are combining a love of acoustic balladeering and digital beats, of the wan and the Warp label, to form this new generation of laptop troubadours. But what to call this movement? Balladisco? Songtronica? Bleepadour? Whatever, the blend of the synthetic and organic is immensely appealing when it's done well, and James Yuill is a superb exponent of such melancholy electronica. <br> His debut album is called Turning Down Water for Air, the title a metaphor for rejecting one essential thing for another, and it could almost be about Yuill's own schizoid impulses. On most of his songs the disparate elements are fused quite beautifully, but live he is prone to distinguishing the two approaches, even on occasion doing separate acoustic and electronic shows. But it's when he merges the two that he's most interesting. His best songs really are like Nick Drake given a machine pulse by New Order, such as Over the Hills, which has the sort of lovely chord changes and childlike reminiscences that Bernard Sumner once called his own. Left Handed Girl sounds like an Aphex Twin tune being played by a busker. And No Pins Allowed, a former single, is soft and sensitive but has an Italian house piano break and a fuzzy synthbass surge that makes it sound like Justice crashing the forlorn folkie sing-song. To ram the point home he's even recorded a version of Radiohead's Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box.  The 27-year-old used to work for a company that picked out music for TV adverts. His hardest job was once having to convince a client not to use a Libertines song called Arbeit Macht Frei, a phrase which the Nazis used to hang as signs over their concentration camps. Not appropriate. Now his toughest task is working out how to dovetail most seamlessly his plaintive melodies with his digital rhythms. And when he's not working on his own music he's applying his knowledge of beat science to other artists, like his hero Aphex Twin adopting an alias, Hunger/Thirst, to remix the likes of Tilly &amp; the Wall, the Answering Machine and Au Revoir Simone. What else? He recently did the music for and gave a talk at a music conference, Meet the Millennials, where his burgeoning career was studied by industry experts keen to know how to build an audience and make money from music in this download age. Oh, and he likes Guinness, and he sounds like he's intoxicated by his own sweet sorrow, which is why he's gotta dance to keep from crying. Or something.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Why can't all singer-songwriters be this imaginative? Lusciously sad laptop folk with a dancefloor pulse.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> He even looks like the speccy lank-haired one from the Chemical Brothers\u2026<br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Love the snow when it falls in winter. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Appreciate being called a synther-songwriter.<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Turning Down Water for Air is released by Moshi Moshi on October 13, preceded one week by the single This Sweet Love.

  "<p>Andrew Adonis' recent <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/education/2616177/City-academies-to-take-over-primary-schools.html\">announcement</a> that he is committed to a massive expansion of the privately-sponsored city academies programme from its present 83 schools to well over 400, was accompanied by strong rhetoric about improving standards and extending choice. But is the current direction of government policy in education, including the wider emphasis on selective <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/nov/14/schools.uk2\">faith schools</a>, the best way to achieve this?</p> <p>Today sees the launch of a new coalition, <a href=\"http://www.accordcoalition.org.uk/\">Accord</a>, which is bringing together people from a wide range of backgrounds to argue that good schooling is not about achievement at any cost. It is also about building educational bridges between children from different communities for the sake of a common future.</p> <p>The social, cultural and belief mix made possible by truly inclusive schools is vital if we are to challenge the divisions and inequalities that exist in our society, and if we are to build understanding and encourage encounters between pupils and families who otherwise live in quite different spheres.</p> <p>The government says that its vision for the future of schooling in Britain is based on partnership between public money and investment from the worlds of business, religion and private philanthropy. But to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/20/thetruthaboutchurchschools\">many</a> parents, teachers and civic-minded people, it appears that the current system tends to be as much about <a href=\"http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/6925\">string pulling</a> as pulling together.</p> <p>Faith schools are a particular focus of Accord's concern. Government legislation has given increasing freedom to religious organisations in running state-maintained faith schools, while reducing their corresponding financial commitment. These schools receive up to 90% of their capital costs and 100% of their running costs from the general taxpayer. Yet they are able to impose their own religious restrictions on admissions, employment, curriculum content and compulsory worship.</p> <p>Today, for example, section 37 of the <a href=\"http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/publications/educationandinspectionsact/\">Education and Inspections Act 2006</a> comes into force. This makes it legal for voluntary-controlled schools to reserve the headship for those of one belief only, and for voluntary-aided schools to discriminate against non-teaching staff on the basis of their beliefs.</p> <p>Accord's supporters (which includes Christian clergy, rabbis, secular humanists, teachers, academics and public figures \u2013 those of different religions and of no religion) are united in the conviction that this is wrong. Granting privileges and exemptions to any one group builds barriers rather than bridges.</p> <p>In particular, Accord believes that all schools, irrespective of how they are constituted, should operate admissions and employment policies that do not discriminate on the basis of religion or belief. It also argues that they should follow an objective, fair and balanced syllabus (whether determined by their local authority or by any future national syllabus or curriculum for religious education); should be accountable under a single inspection regime for RE, personal, social, health education (PSHE) and citizenship; and should offer pupils inclusive, inspiring and stimulating assemblies in place of compulsory acts of worship.</p> <p>Such reforms, based on common principles of fairness and equality, would change the landscape of schooling policy in an undoubtedly positive direction \u2013 moving us away from a fruitlessly polarised debate where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jul/28/comment.schools\">some</a> argue that faith schools can do no right and <a href=\"http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/wholeschool/faithschools/\">others</a> that they can do no wrong. The reality is undoubtedly more complex than that, but the current framework is nevertheless rooted in <a href=\"http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/5709\">practices</a> of privilege and discrimination that are clearly unacceptable in a plural society.</p> <p>As a Christian, I am particularly offended when I meet people who have to mask their true beliefs to get their kids into a church school, or when injustices and special favours on behalf of a few (religious or demographic) are justified in the name of a \"church ethos\". As Oxford theologian Professor Chris Rowland puts it, in taking the gospel message seriously:</p> <blockquote> <p>Churches should be championing social justice and equality for all in education, not privileging their own.</p> </blockquote> <p>For some involved in Accord, the logic of community-wide education says that faith schools per se are an unacceptable anomaly in the publicly-funded sector. For others, like <a href=\"http://www.atl.org.uk/\">Association of Teachers and Lecturers</a> and the religion and society think-tank <a href=\"http://www.ekklesia.co.uk\">Ekklesia</a>, the key issue is policies and practices that enshrine fairness for all, rather than a straightforward \"pro\" or \"anti\" principle.</p> <p>As well as a campaign seeking direct engagement with government policy and public debate, Accord will therefore also create a positive conversation between people who may not have exactly the same views but who recognise that institutional discrimination is deeply corrosive in the education system. It will help give voice to the concerns of the significant majority of people who, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/aug/23/schools.faithschools\">polling</a> repeatedly shows, do not want sectional interests to be given priority over our children's shared future.</p>",
  "<p>A third body has been found in the burnt-out Shropshire home of the millionaire businessman Christopher Foster, detectives said today.</p> <p>West Mercia police said the remains were found in the main section of Osbaston House in Maesbrook, Shropshire, last night.</p> <p>A Home Office pathologist attended the scene and confirmed that the remains were human.</p> <p>Two bodies were discovered in the wreckage of the mansion, on the Welsh borders, at the weekend.

His wife acted as company secretary for the family business.</p> <p>Yesterday, people gathered to say prayers for the family at nearby St John's church.</p> <p>Addressing the congregation, the Reverend Prebendary David Austerberry said residents had been left \"bewildered and stunned\" by the tragedy.</p> <p>\"It is hard to grasp exactly what has happened, and it is clearly going to be some time before everything is revealed, but today we pray for the Fosters and their family and friends who must be devastated by the events of early last Tuesday morning,\" he said.</p>",

  "<p>Despite the deep rift between many sections of the worldwide Muslim and Jewish communities, the two religions share a great deal, in terms of their joint heritage and approach to making the world a better place. The arena of altruism is a good example of the common ground between adherents of both faiths, with Jew and Muslim alike required to apportion significant amounts of their incomes to charitable causes. </p> <p>Jews are bound to <a href=\"http://www.jewfaq.org/tzedakah.htm\">donate</a> 10% of their earnings to help those less fortunate than themselves, whilst Muslims are compelled to give under a similar framework (<a href=\"http://www.brevardmasjid.com/zakat/index.html\">zakat</a>). With this in mind, a group of British Jews and Muslims have formed a joint venture, the Jerusalem interest-free microfinance fund (<a href=\"http://www.jerusalemmicrofinance.com\">JIMF</a>), with the intention of freeing both Jewish and Arab residents of the holy city from the shackles of poverty. </p> <p>On top of the immediate benefits to the recipients of the fund's no-interest loans, JIMF's trustees hope to make an impact on a larger scale in terms of the Israel-Palestine conflict. Those who receive JIMF's assistance will, it is hoped, be brought together by their common need, and \"realise that their common interests, such as feeding their families, are greater than the things that divide them\", according to trustee Michael Pollak. </p> <p>Loans of between $5,000 and $10,000 will be granted to suitable candidates, who are expected to come in the main from orthodox Jewish and Muslim communities; sectors of society prevented by religious law from entering into interest-paying contracts. The project is the brainchild of Pollak and his partner Donald Franklin, a British-Jewish academic who has been involved in cross-communal initiatives in the UK for several years. </p> <p>Another trustee is Liberal Democrat councillor <a href=\"http://fiyazmughal.org.uk/\">Fiyaz Mughal</a>, who spoke of his delight at the project's successful establishment. \"The fund is a really good idea, especially in an area which is usually portrayed in a very negative way\", he said. He pointed out that the fund will do its best to avoid granting loans in contentious circumstances where possible, such as supporting the creation of Jewish businesses in disputed areas across the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Line_(Israel)\">Green Line</a>. </p> <p>JIMF are taking this approach for pragmatic reasons as well as political, so as to avoid upsetting the sensibilities of potential donors. \"Muslims in the UK are not averse to helping Jews in general\", said Mughal, \"but it is more about which specific areas the money is going to\". He said that British Muslims are aware that \"they have to move beyond just supporting Arab communities\", and that there was a realisation that JIMF's work was a much-needed countering of the sectarian divisiveness so prevalent in the region. </p> <p>However, to date the only money raised has come from the Jewish community, who have contributed around $200,000 to the cause. Mughal hopes that Muslim donors will soon appear on the scene, but admitted that it could be \"a one to two year\" timescale on that front. At the same time, despite having raised a significant amount from British Jewry, Pollak remarked that there had been some heated opposition to the fund's work from within Jewish circles. </p> <p>\"People get very proprietorial when it comes to Israel\", he said. \"They think that it's 'our' money going to 'them', when they hear that we will be supporting Arab citizens in need\". He remains undeterred by the abuse, however, and strongly believes that JIMF's work will be to the benefit of all residents of the region. \"By helping these people start their own businesses and stand on their own two feet, we will help draw them into the democratic process\", he said. </p> <p>\"Once people own a stake in the economy, and once their businesses are up and running, they will have an interest in the stability of the country\", he explained, \"and be less likely to [become extremists]\". He hopes that those assisted by the fund will eventually come into contact with their fellow recipients from the other side of the societal divide, via joint training days run by JIMF to teach them the requisite skills to manage their own companies. </p> <p>JIMF has the ability to provide scores of families with a way out of poverty, and in a city with a large percentage of the population living below the poverty line, there will be no end of suitable contenders for their assistance. However, at the other end of the spectrum, there is the potential to encourage less insularity on the part of both Muslim and Jewish philanthropists. For all that charity is said to begin at home, such an approach does nothing to promote cross-communal awareness, nor build bridges between the two camps.</p> <p>That the likes of Pollak, Mughal, and their fellow trustees, are committed to causes beyond their immediate communities is a shot in the arm for anyone looking for a glimmer of hope in this troubled region. In the upper echelons of Israeli and Palestinian politics, stalemate is the order of the day, and has been for years. Down at street level, on the other hand, at least there are some pockets of resistance to the deadlock that has paralysed the two peoples for so long.</p>",

  "<p>Did you like the idea of getting 2GB of free storage from BT when you signed up for its broadband service? Seems some people did. We're not sure who - we <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2006/oct/26/comment.guardianweeklytechnologysection\">comprehensively rubbished it</a> when it launched in October 2006 - but nevertheless there must have been some people, perhaps egged on by that BT advert. You know, the one with the bloke who was <strike> Nathan Barley </strike>.. in My Family <em>(thanks CSClark in the comments)</em>.</p> <p>As we warned: \"But hang on. BT will, in effect, be holding your stuff to ransom. What happens if you decide to stop coughing up? Will the jerky videos of the cat be lost forever?\"</p> <p>Now the broadband behemoth has decided either that there are so many people doing it who rely on it so heavily that they can be turned into paying customers, or that the free game's not worth the candle. (Or both.)</p> <p>It has sent out an email pointing out that people who sign up with BT now no longer get the free service; and also pointing out that if you want your data to survive, you'll have to cough up:</p> <blockquote> <p>We wanted to let you know we will be withdrawing the BT Digital Vault Basic (2GB) product shortly. This means you'll need to upgrade to BT Digital Vault Plus within the next 60 days to access, upload or share your stored files.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Upgrade to BT Digital Vault Plus for only \u00a34.99 a month...We'll switch off your BT Digital Vault 2GB service on the 30th October 2008, so make sure you upgrade now to get continuous protection for all your precious photos, files and more.</p> </blockquote> <p>(Got to love that \"we wanted to let you know\". It as though they're telling you your shoelace was undone or something.)</p> <p>Except it's not as simple as that, as Chris Edwards (a regular contributor to the Technology section - have you read XXX yet? - <a href=\"http://blog.hackingcough.com/2008/08/bt_continues_ho.htm\">points out</a>. More BT emailery:</p> <p>\"We'd like to assure you that any data you currently hold in your vault will continue to be stored safely. Your free Digital Vault Basic (2GB) account will be converted to a free 1GB Digital Vault Basic account automatically in the next 60 days.\"</p> <p>Er, right, so if you've got more than 1GB up there?</p> <blockquote> <p>\"You can continue to access all your stored files from your free 1GB Digital Vault Basic, however you won't be able to upload any new files until your total usage falls below 1GB or if you are a BT Total Broadband customer you can upgrade to Digital Vault (5GB) at no extra cost.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Still not clear about what happens to the amount that's above 1GB. Is it visible? Does it get chopped off at the knees, and if so on what basis? Oldest? Newest? Largest? Smallest?</p> <p>As Chris says, \"If BT customers weren't confused, they probably will be now. I don't know why the company couldn't just come out and say: 'Sorry, we messed up. It was a bad idea to offer a free service and then just kill it, so we've changed our minds about switching off the 2GB service. Here's 1GB as a consolation prize.'\"</p> <p>This doesn't though answer the question of what BT thought the value of the Digital Vault was to it. If it's halving the free space, then it's decided that the Vault isn't sufficient a come-on to people to make them consider changing their provider. (Unsurprising, really, since anyone changing provider might by now have heard of companies called \"Google\", \"Microsoft\" and \"Yahoo\", each of which offers forms of online cloud-based storage for free. There's also Apple, but its online storage is costly and, of late, flaky.</p> <p>We'll put a call in to BT, but thought you might all want to rush out and buy memory sticks or similar to store those 2GB on. I think a fiver would about cover it. Carry them - password-protected or encrypted, please - around in a pocket. It's as effective as BT's service, and you won't have to wrestle with confusing marketing ads.</p> <p>I think this one generally falls under <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/jul/10/it.security\">Schofield's Second Law of Computing</a>: <em>data doesn't really exist unless you have at least two copies of it.</em> If you've got more than 1GB in that free BT Digital Vault account, there's no telling which part of it is really safe. (Pedants note: yes, data should be plural there, but the word is fast becoming a plural singular.)</p> <p>Thanks to Chris Edwards for the pointer. As he puts it, \"<a href=\"http://blog.hackingcough.com/2008/08/bt_continues_ho.htm\">BT continues hopeless search for a clue</a>\".</p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> Chris Edwards asked BT, which <a href=\"http://twitter.com/chrised/statuses/905589819\">told him</a> that the purpose was to get people to upgrade - though it wasn't clear about why the 1GB difference would make that happen. BT <a href=\"http://twitter.com/chrised/statuses/905590048\">insists</a> that \"We're not running out of space, it's just a question of how we allocate it.\" In a pricey manner, if you ask me.</p>",
  "<p>It took only six days for Katrina to build up from a tropical depression over the Bahamas to a hurricane that devastated the city of New Orleans on August 29 2005 with the loss of nearly 2,000 lives. </p> <p>The aftermath, with severe criticism of the way the federal government dealt with the emergency, became one of the defining moments in the fading popularity of President Bush. </p> <p>The cost in reconstruction \u2013 still going on - was the highest in the country's hurricane history at more than $100bn (\u00a350bn). Tens of thousands of people left the city, never to return. </p> <p>As Katrina gathered strength and moved towards the Florida Panhandle, Bush declared a state of emergency in parts of Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi but crucially, at that stage, not in any of Louisiana's coastal parishes. </p> <p>Although local emergency plans were put into operation, and the National Guard mobilised, it was not until a day before the disaster that the city's mayor ordered the <a href=\"http://archive.dmz.gnl/verity/index.htm\">mandatory evacuation</a>. </p> <p>The storm surge caused by Katrina's 125mph winds overwhelmed New Orleans' defences against the sea, breaching many of the levees or dykes and flooding nearly 80% of the city. People reported seeing bodies lying for several days in the waters. </p> <p>The most graphic images to come out of New Orleans in the days after Katrina spent her energies up near the Great Lakes, were the desperate <a href=\"http://cms.guprod.gnl/59997/images/link.gif\">refugees in the Louisiana Superdome</a> and the New Orleans Civic Centre. </p> <p>Around 26,000 people were stuck in the Superdome amid reports of deaths from thirst, exhaustion and violence. As most were black there were criticisms of racism in the government's response to the danger and to the weakness of the relief efforts. </p> <p>Within a week Michael D Brown, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, who was directed to order the federal emergency response, was replaced and then resigned in spite of having famously received praise from Bush with the phrase, \"Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job\".</p> <p>Three years later, thousands of displaced residents in Mississippi and Louisiana were still living in trailers. In February 2006 the final <a href=\"www.gpoacess.gov/congress/index/html \">report</a> of a bipartisan congressional committee \"to investigate the preparation for and response to Hurricane Katrina\" was pointedly entitled \"A Failure of Initiative.\" </p> <p>The committee on homeland security followed this with special report called <a href=\"http://www.gpoaccess.gov/serialset/creports/katrinanation.html\">\"Hurricane Katrina: A Nation Still Unprepared\"</a>. </p> <p>A <a href=\"www.pubs.asce.org\">June 2007 report</a> released by the American Society of Civil Engineers said that the failures of the federally built levees in New Orleans were found to be primarily the result of system design flaws. The US Army Corps of Engineers who is responsible for the design and construction of the region's flood-control system failed to pay sufficient attention to public safety, it said. </p> <p>The wider effects across the region were a massive blow to the US economy. Thirty oil platforms were damaged or destroyed and nine refineries were closed. About a quarter of the <a href=\"http://archive.dmz.gnl/verity/index.htm\">oil production from the Gulf of Mexico</a> was shut down. </p> <p>The repercussions live on with funding disputes over the remaining levee improvements. In February, the Bush administration requested that the state of Louisiana pay about $1.5bn of an estimated $7.2bn for Army Corps of Engineers levee work, a proposal which angered many Louisiana leaders.</p> <p>In May Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal used a speech to The National Press Club to request that Bush free up money to complete work on the levees. Bush promised to include the funding in his 2009 budget.</p>",
  "<p>Bad artists of Britain, beware. Jack Straw's Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 seems to be creating a lot of unintentional collateral damage out in the tackier fringes of the art world. The <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2008/ukpga_20080004_en_9#pt5-pb1\">act</a> outlaws \"extreme pornography\" in which a woman or man's life appears to be in danger, as presented for the titillation of the viewer. As such, it also unwittingly includes much art and fashion photography, music video imagery and any other image in which a person (usually, in reality, a woman) is made the object of mortal threat. So it seems that we will no longer get to see any marvellous hipster pics of objectified female meat in danger. What a loss for the world of culture. </p> <p>One of the victims of the act is a photographer, Ben Westwood, son of Dame Vivienne \u2013 no, I hadn't heard of him, either \u2013 whose book of erotic photography, Fuck Fashion, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/columnists/pandora/pandora-westwood-jnr-sweats-over-governments-pornography-clampdown-910761.html \">may be banned</a> when the act comes into effect next January. Furthermore, anyone in possession of it could find themselves in prison, explaining to their cellmate the startling story of their transformation from Soho fashionista to Pentonville porn convict. Displaying the same linguistic vulgarity which went into the titling of his magnum opus, Ben Westwood has said that \"Jack Straw and the home secretary Jacqui Smith need to be bound up together and gagged\" \u2013 just the kind of act that the act opposes, of course. </p> <p>Westwood's personal crudeness aside, the crux of the issue is that the act does not distinguish between types of medium or artistic context. It does not discriminate between cases whether this mortal danger is made visually beautiful, as in fashion photography, or presented raw and gloating as in snuff pornography. I am glad of this lack of distinction, because the fetishisation of female pain is misogynistic regardless of its trappings, regardless of whether it was styled by a couture house, regardless of whether it comes with a poppin' soundtrack and shot by a cool guy director or some coercing creep with a videocam. </p> <p>In seeing how many projects are theoretically affected by the act, we see just how anti-woman contemporary culture really is, how ubiquitous the images of exposed, objecitified women \u2013 and how accepted this is. Thus Westwood can angrily bellow that his \"human rights\" are being violated, ignoring the endemic exploitation of women in the fashion and beauty industries as a whole. I feel feminist contempt for those pseudo-artists who think that sexy glossy naughty photos of near death experiences are in any way interesting. Recall the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/mar/27/broadcasting.comment \">notorious</a> America's Top Model episode where \"the girls\" had to pretend to be dead and were judged by their photogenic deathliness. That'd be punished by the act too, and the people (of both sexes) who devised the shoot would struggle to justify themselves. </p> <p>The legislation seeks to confront the violence of certain types of pornography, but it also shows us how far the pornification of general culture has progressed. Both, of course, are anti-woman. If sexist male artists and anti-feminist female artists are penalised for brainlessly fetishing female pain, then that's all to the good. Let them squirm.</p>",
  "<p>Howl farewell to the dog days of August. They were mostly damp and drab, not to mention marking the beginning of a 100-month countdown to the world entering a new, more perilous phase of global warming. Not everything, though, can be blamed directly on climate change. For the record, weather varies enormously due to short-term atmospheric changes. The climate system, however, changes in response to the complex push and pull of many spheres, from solar radiation to ice cover and greenhouse gas levels. Weather is a subset of climate, whose long-term patterns will nevertheless change as the climate system alters.</p> <p>One month ago, writing in the Guardian, we said that the world had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/01/climatechange.carbonemissions\">100 months to go</a> before it stood to cross a threshold, after which we will all be playing a game of climate roulette. Runaway global warming is the bullet in the chamber. With all the work and words expended on the issue, still, we thought, a reality check was needed. Unlike other issues demanding a political solution, climate change is on a ticking clock. We either do, or we don't, avert runaway warming.</p> <p>The response to pointing this out was astonishing.</p> <p>In just the first three weeks, via <a href=\"http://www.onehundredmonths.org/\">the website</a>, more than 135,000 people from more than 130 countries signed either themselves up to take regular monthly actions on climate change, or were directly asked to do so by friends. One man in New Zealand printed out the Guardian article and posted it to all 121 members of his national parliament. Rap star P Diddy reportedly grounded his airplane, although, just possibly, this might have had something more to do with the cost of fuel.</p> <p>Many worried that in drawing attention to such a stark reality, the consequence would be a disabling sense of powerlessness. If you see someone crossing the road in front of a runaway truck, the balance has to be struck between shouting so loud that they freeze in their tracks, and closing your eyes to pretend it's not happening. Al Gore's team in the US has struggled with it. One of his campaign psychological advisors (this is the US, remember, they have such things) got in touch to say that the One Hundred Months initiative was just right, in terms of facing the inconvenient truth and leaving people with a sense that they can act to make every month count.</p> <p>The countdown also came to the attention of the world's most important figure on climate change, the Nobel Prize-winning chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, <a href=\"http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2007/ipcc-lecture_en.html\">R K Pachauri</a>. He wrote to us commenting that: \"It speaks highly of the effectiveness of this effort that so many people have signed themselves up for regular monthly campaigns over the next 100 months. This is most heartening, and it is efforts such as these that can make a difference to stabilize the earth's climate and in moving human society on the path of sustainable development.\"</p> <p>From the <a href=\"http://www.thewi.org.uk/\">Women's Institute</a> in the UK, to the Green Belt movement in Kenya (led by <a href=\"http://www.greenbeltmovement.org/w.php?id=3\">Wangari Maathai</a>, another Nobel Prize winner), groups have been signing up to push for accelerated action over the next 100 months.</p> <p>New research from the <a href=\"http://www.tyndall.ac.uk/\">Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research</a> at Manchester University added extra urgency in the last month. Targets for tackling global warming often leave out vital greenhouse gas emissions, such as those stemming from international transport and the environmental domino effects referred to by scientists as \"carbon cycle feedbacks\". Tyndall's research director, Kevin Anderson, concludes that when these things are taken into account, the UK's emissions must peak by the year 2012 and then decline by at least 6 to 9 per cent annually. It is misleading to talk, as the government does, about long-term targets for the year 2050, because what matters is how greenhouse gases accumulate on a yearly basis. Our only option, he says, it to \"radically and urgently curtail ... demand for energy\".</p> <p>The howling question then, with which to leave the British summer behind, is how to provide security to people in fuel poverty, and pay for the rapid transition to a low carbon economy?</p> <p>Step forward the suddenly popular <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree+politics/taxandspending\">windfall tax</a>. In October 2006, we proposed a recurrent additional tax on UK fossil fuel companies to pay into what we called an Oil Legacy Fund. It was to follow the fantastically successful Norwegian example which, over years, built up a financial safety net for future generations that was worth, at the last count, around 260bn euros (\u00a3198bn), or 75,000 euros (\u00a357,000) for every man, woman and child in the country.</p> <p>Revived by a combination of MPs, the regulator Ofgem and Labour activists in the Compass group, a powerful case is now being made in the face of high oil prices and Labour's current political difficulties.</p> <p>Just three companies \u2013 BP, Centrica and Shell \u2013 together made \u00a31,000 profit per second over the first six months of 2008. At the same time, every second, mankind overall is emitting 1,000 tonnes of CO2. As the climate clock keeps ticking, possibly the most important challenge is to end a system that allows vast profits to be made at the cost of undermining the climatic foundations of civilisation. A recurrent windfall tax would do that.</p> <p>As Winston Churchill said in parliament in November 1936, \"The era of procrastination, of half measures, of soothing and baffling expedients, of delays, is coming to its close. In its place, we are entering a period of consequences ... I never would have believed that we should have been allowed to go on getting into this plight, month by month ...\"</p> <p>On the climate clock, it is now 99 months, and counting.</p> <p><em>To be part of the solution go to <a href=\"http://onehundredmonths.org/\">www.onehundredmonths.org</a> \u2013 and tell your friends.</em></p>",
  "<p>Artificial clouds to reflect away sunlight, creating colossal blooms of oceanic algae and the global use of synthetic carbon-neutral transport fuels are just three of the climate transforming technologies in need of urgent investigation, according to leading scientists. The eminent group argue that, with governments failing to grasp the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/01/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange2\">urgent need for measures to combat dangerous climate change</a>, radical \u2013 and possibly dangerous \u2013 solutions must now be seriously considered.</p> <p>The idea of engineering on a planetary scale in a bid to control climate has been around for more than 50 years but, to date, has remained on the fringes. The potential for dramatic and beneficial change has hitherto been outweighed by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/01/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange1\">risk of unexpected side-effects in the complex climate system, with global consequences</a>. Now, in a special edition of the journal <a href=\"http://publishing.royalsociety.org/\">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</a>, climate scientists and engineers have brought together the latest research and issued a call for a far-reaching assessment of a raft of geo-engineering techniques.</p> <p>\"We are now, or soon will be, confronting issues of whether, when and how to engineer a climate that is more to our liking,\" argues Ken Caldeira, a leading climate scientist based at the <a href=\"http://www.ciw.edu/\">Carnegie Institution</a> in Stanford, California. If a decision is made to move ahead with climate engineering, he says, then it will be essential to understand the point at which the risks and costs of geo-engineering outweigh the impacts of global warming. </p> <p>Not everyone is so unequivocally positive, however, including <a href=\"http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/\">Stephen Schneider of Stanford University</a>. In an overall assessment of the geo-engineering challenge, he notes that critics ask whether it is socially feasible to expect the many centuries of international political stability and co-operation that would be needed to operate global scale schemes. He adds that the potential also exists for conflicts between nations if geo-engineering projects go wrong. </p> <h2>Air</h2> <p>Some of the most extreme ideas for climate engineering involve reducing the sunlight falling on the Earth's surface, as a way to offset the increase in temperatures caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Caldeira calculates that reflecting just 2% of the Sun's light from the right places on Earth (mainly the Arctic) would be enough to counteract the warming effect from a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</p> <p>One approach is to insert \"scatterers\" into the stratosphere. Caldeira cites an idea to deploy jumbo jets into the upper atmosphere and deposit clouds of tiny particles there, such as sulphur dioxide. Dispersing around 1m tonnes of sulphur dioxide per year across 10m square kilometres of the atmosphere would be enough to reflect away sufficient amounts of sunlight. </p> <p>In a separate study, <a href=\"http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/harvieb/salter.html\">Stephen Salter of the University of Edinburgh</a> proposes building 300-tonne ships that could spray micrometre-sized drops of seawater into the air under stratocumulus clouds. \"The method is not intended to make new clouds. It will just make existing clouds whiter,\" he wrote. The ships would drag turbines in their wake, which would provide the power needed to spray the water.</p> <h2>Ocean</h2> <p>The growth of marine algae and other phytoplankton captures vast quantities of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but growth is often limited by a lack of essential nutrients. Adding such nutrients, such as iron or nitrates, to stimulate growth was studied by a team led by <a href=\"http://www.noc.soton.ac.uk/obe/index.php?action=staff_entry&amp;SID=234\">Richard Lampitt of the National Oceanography Centre</a> in Southampton. The organisms incorporate atmospheric CO2 as they grow and, when they die, sink to the bottom of the ocean, taking the carbon with them.</p> <p>Lampitt argues for a large-scale experiments of an area of ocean measuring 100km by 100km and monitored by an independent team of scientists. \"Once this research has been carried out, it will be the responsibility of the science community to perform appropriate cost-benefit-risk analyses in order to inform policy.\"</p> <p>However, there is at present a moratorium around the world on iron-seeding experiments. \"The idea is unpopular with the public because it is perceived as meddling with nature,\" writes Victor Smetacek of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany and Wajih Naqvi of the National Institute of Oceanography in India. But they say rejecting seeding is premature as there have been no experiments to date that fully test the concept and the counter-arguments are based on worst-case scenarios.</p> <h2>Transport</h2> <p>More a fifth of the world's human-induced emissions of carbon dioxide come from transport. While technical fixes for these emissions might not count as geo-engineering by the strictest definition, their global effect means they can be considered alongside other options to reduce the CO2 in the atmosphere. In the long term, experts believe people should be driving electric or hydrogen-fueled cars but those technologies will take too long to arrive for Frank Zeman of Columbia University and David Keith of the University of Calgary. </p> <p>They propose the development of synthetic fuels called carbon-neutral hydrocarbons (CNHC) as a near-term alternative to petrol and diesel. Made by reacting together carbon dioxide and hydrogen, these fuels can be used in cars without the need for major modification of either vehicles or infrastructure. More importantly, burning them would not contribute to global warming, provided the component ingredients have been manufactured in a carbon-neutral way. The CO2 could come directly from the air, from plants or else from coal-fired power stations using carbon capture and storage technology (CCS). The latter method could also reduce the potential problems of the planned worldwide increase in the number of fossil-fuel power stations. The <a href=\"http://www.iea.org/\">International Energy Agency</a> predicts the world's use of power will increase by 50% by 2030, with 77% of that coming from fossil fuels; CCS holds the promise of preventing up to 90% of the carbon emissions from a power station escaping into the atmosphere.</p> <h2>Wild Card</h2> <p>Other ideas considered by scientists, though not in the papers published today, include scrubbing carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. Klaus Lackner of Columbia University has designed a machine that could, if built to full scale, take up the CO2 emissions of 15,000 cars. With around 250,000 such machines, it would be possible to remove as much CO2 from the atmosphere as the world is currently pumping into it. The gas could then be stored underground or used in a manufacturing process.</p> <p>An idea further into the realms of the fantastic involves using shiny spacecraft to block sunlight. Scientists have suggested launching a constellation of free-flying craft that would sit between the Sun and Earth forming a cylindrical cloud around half the Earth's diameter and 10 times longer. \"Approximately 10% of the sunlight passing through the 60,000 mile length of the cloud, pointing lengthwise between the Earth and the Sun would be diverted away from the Earth, which would uniformly reduce sunlight over the planet by approximately 2%,\" writes Stephen Schneider of Stanford University. The cost would be a dazzling $100bn (\u00a355.5bn) a year.</p>",
  "<p>Forget maternity leave. What happens to the women who disappear from the world of work for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2008/sep/01/workandcareers.women\">years on end</a>? Do they ever have a chance to get back to where they were? And what is the longest they can leave it?</p> <p>These women are the subject of New York novelist Meg Wolitzer's funny, clever new book The Ten Year Nap. It analyses the mixed feelings of four friends who all had babies at the same time and found themselves drifting gradually away from their careers in law, art, banking and film. Ten years on they fear they are running out of excuses to stay at home.<br><br>As Wolitzer puts it: </p> <blockquote> <p>The rest of the world doesn't fall away when you have children. But your priorities are with your family. You're not exactly asleep but you're in the dream of family life. </p> </blockquote> <p>The book has proved provocative - not least because anyone who looks after children for any amount of time knows that it is not much of a \"nap\". </p> <p>In the US, \"re-launching\" - going back to work after a break of several years - is the subject of heated debate. It's a bigger social issue than it is in the UK or elsewhere in Europe because maternity provision and childcare are so poor in America. </p> <p>As Wolitzer argues, many educated, middle-class American women feel pushed out of their careers; they love their family life but they want something to go back to eventually. Often their anxieties are overlooked because they are considered privileged. Many working mothers (and fathers) would love to have the agony of choice.</p> <p>The problem exists on a smaller scale in the UK: many stay-at-home mothers feel completely excluded once they have spent as little as a year out of the workplace. And getting back into a particular career can be almost impossible. It would seem that once you're out of the job market for two years or more it takes an average of two years to get rehired.</p> <p>But the more we talk about the problems of \"napping\" long term and discuss strategies of getting back into work, the easier it will get. Anyone know any shortcuts? And if it's so difficult, is it worth going back at all?</p>",
  "<p>Some might call it a lesson in the law of unintended consequences. For others, however, the bitter aftertaste of Tony Blair's saccharine-coated \"<a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page1297\">doctrine of the international community</a>\" was all too obvious when he outlined it nearly a decade ago. </p> <p>The reheated cold warriors who've fulminated over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/georgia\">events in the Caucasus</a> this month would do well to go back to that speech at the Chicago Economics Club in 1999. <br> Nato bombs were raining on Belgrade, eviscerating TV make-up women and destroying civilian infrastructure. Shamelessly, Blair posed as the stoic British prime minister who had voyaged across the Atlantic to remind America of its world historic role at the hour of Europe's need. </p> <p>\"On its 50th birthday Nato must prevail,\" he said, \"Success is the only exit strategy I am prepared to consider.\"</p> <p>He went on to locate the Kosovo war in the context of the then fashionable cliches of globalising capitalism and the changing roles of states and international alliances. The war's salience lay in recognising that the advance of the global free market depended on the preparedness of an undefined \"international community\" to, as he would put it two years later, \"reorder this world\" by force when necessary. </p> <p>Thus, according to Blair in his address to Chicago neo-liberals, \"The most pressing foreign policy problem we face is to identify the circumstances in which we should get actively involved in other people's conflicts\".</p> <p>That meant riding roughshod over the doctrine of the sovereignty of nation states dating from the peace of Westphalia \u2013 clearly his urge to modernise outdated notions had burst beyond such trifles as the welfare state and the Labour party. </p> <p>Those of us who protested were castigated and calumniated against as the real dyed in the wool conservatives who had not understood that the world had moved on. In fact, our concern was that the Kosovo intervention and its justification were taking the world back. The sovereignty of nations was never an inviolable and faultless principle \u2013 and none of us on the left had said otherwise. But Blair's humanitarian interventionism, his 21st century civilising mission, was no advance on it. </p> <p>It was a throwback to the Gladstonian liberal imperialism of the 1880s, which also was born with ballyhoo about Balkan atrocities, at that time Bulgarian. Two consequences flowed at the end of the 19th century. </p> <p>First, peoples across the globe rapidly came to suffer murder and mayhem far worse and more extensive than any visited by one Balkan nationality upon another. The carnage in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australasia still evades the North American and European imaginations because, quite simply, the victims were not white and the perpetrators were. </p> <p>Second, as other states decided that they too had a duty to civilise, the scramble for Africa, China and elsewhere brought the European powers first into diplomatic conflict and skirmish, and then, when conquests in neither the east nor the west had filled their maw, into a cataclysmic clash on their own continent. </p> <p>It's worth recalling the scorn heaped on those of us who raised these points nine years ago, warning of the vicious circle interventionist wars would unleash, and then turning to events today in the Black Sea's own Balkans. </p> <p>Perhaps the mandarins of King Charles Street have a manual on how to hold a straight face and keep talking when all around are gasping incredulously. Maybe there's an <em>homage</em> to Kipling along those lines. Or maybe it's just the way our current foreign secretary is eerily adopting the tics and mannerisms of our former prime minister. Either way, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/davidmiliband.ukraine\">David Miliband's performance over Georgia</a> has been a spectacle to behold.</p> <p>There was the bluster about the territorial integrity of small nations \u2013 this from a government that had only months previously proclaimed its support for ripping out Kosovo from what is left of Yugoslavia. The recognition by Washington and London of Kosovo's secession prompted a warning from Moscow, which, thanks to many years of Russian weakness and US triumphalism, was predictably ignored. </p> <p>There are other nations besides Kosovo that might want to secede elsewhere and with greater claim, said the Kremlin, and if you recognise Kosovo against our wishes, don't be surprised if we end up recognising other secessionists against yours. </p> <p>The frothing from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/29/russia.georgia1\">Miliband</a> and Condoleezza Rice when Russia did just that exposes the hypocrisy at the heart of western policy as outlined by Blair. When it comes down to it, for all the talk of universal moral objectives in international affairs, the right to pursue them turns out not to be universal, but to be vested in particular powers, and, it seems, some nations' rights are more inviolable than others. </p> <p>They call it the international community, but it is not even the community of the permanent members of the UN Security Council, still less the UN General Assembly. It is, as with Kosovo, a community that is coterminous with the biggest military alliance on the planet, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which has strayed very far indeed from the Atlantic. </p> <p>For more than a decade, successive British and US governments could get away with this sleight of hand. Russia was enfeebled, robbed blind by foreign-domiciled billionaires. China was just a manufactured-in stamp piled high in the pound shop. </p> <p>Not now. The unipolar future turns out to have been a moment in the past. And that makes the hubris that led from Kosovo through Iraq to today's missile shields and Cold War rhetoric all the more dangerous. One of the \"collateral casualties\" of the Kosovo war was the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. The result of a similar air strike in \"rogue\" capitals today doesn't bear thinking about. Nor do the consequences that would have flowed had Georgia been a member of Nato with its mutual military obligations. </p> <p>The Russian action in Georgia has underscored the limits of US power, but Anglo-US arrogance is unabated. For the US \u2013 despite the dying days of the Bush administration \u2013 there is a logic. It is a global power, still the only true global power. However dangerous the game, it's not difficult to see why the US establishment, and not merely the Bush regime, plays it. </p> <p>But why should Britain? Maybe it was the gap between western bombast and Russian facts on the ground, but there was something truly ridiculous about Miliband travelling to Ukraine to shake his fist at the east. He preached extending Nato membership to a country where two thirds of the people are not in favour of it and which is already ruptured by east/west tensions and internal conflicts that make Georgia look like Switzerland. </p> <p>The Labour government in London again managed to outflank to the right Nicolas Sarkozy, Angela Merkel and even Silvio Berlusconi \u2013 but for what? To share this time not in foolish, short-lived triumph in the Middle East, but in Bush's humiliation. </p> <p>The world is at that most dangerous of places: where one way of ordering states and systems is giving way to another. That usually doesn't happen without some major rupture and frequently with attendant violence. The worst place to be in such circumstances is as some ersatz power, an imperial hangover not of yesterday, but of the last century, busy threatening rising or renewing powers with the armies belonging to an ailing one. </p> <p>Georgia's hapless president, the New York lawyer Mikheil Saakashvili, has just learnt what it means to plunge into dangerous waters on the ebb tide. It's a lesson that Britain's political elite would do well to heed.</p>",

It's rumoured that the bid would be a British transfer record (\u00a337m, since you ask).</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>1.52pm: </strong>Midfielder Blerim Dzemaili, who made just one appearance for Bolton last season, will have to wait awhile before making another. Torino have signed the 22-year-old on a one-year loan deal. Meanwhile, Berbatov apparently legged it from Spurs training this morning - pausing only for a quick fag, one would imagine - to board a plane from Stansted to Manchester. But whereabouts in Manchester? Meanwhile, Arno Onink - who probably has to spell his name to people down the phone as frequently as yours truly - asks: \"Is that minute-by-minute application run by BAA?\" Very probably.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>2.02pm: </strong>West Ham defender George McCartney is having a medical at Sunderland. Meanwhile, Spurs boss Juande Ramos says of the Berbatov saga: \"One way or another, I hope it's finalised today.\" And so say all of us.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>2.06pm: </strong>\"A big good afternoon and welcome to you too, Les,\" says a cheery Hugh Watson. \"Or should it be Roop?\" No, Hugh, it most certainly should not. \"And if so, is that pronounced like Co-op?\" I have no idea. \"Why can't David Moyes get anyone to sign for Everton?\" asks Hugh, suddenly coming over all sensible. \"I mean, he must be a reasonably good manager because they're always finishing far higher than they deserve to, given their dreadfully thin squad. And they're not a small club, really \u2013 with a fair bit of tradition. You'd have thought there would be a queue half way up Gwladys Street. It's a mystery, that's what it is.\" Well Hugh, they signed Lars Christian Jacobsen and Segundo Castillo last week - the real problem seems to be finding quality. How Moyes could do with a marquee player to appease the fans.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>2.14pm: </strong>\"Wouldn't it be delicious,\" says Tom Hopkins, \"if - after all his whining about going to a bigger, better club in Manchester - Berbatov got shipped out to Man City? God surely does have a sense of humour after all.\" I'm saying nothing, Tom.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>2.20pm: </strong>\"Julian Gray is apparently around the Fulham area having gone up for a medical ahead of a move,\" writes Donald Cox, kindly pointing me in the direction of <a href=\"http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/coventry-city-fc/coventry-city-fc-news/2008/09/01/julian-gray-set-to-join-fulham-92746-21649147/\">this</a> snippet from the Coventry Telegraph. \"As a Coventry fan, this makes me love Roy Hodgson even more than before,\" says Donald, shattering the fond illusions of Fulham fans everywhere.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>2.27pm: </strong>\"It would be all the more delicious,\" says Robert Jones in response to Tom Hopkins (<strong>2.14pm</strong>), \"if in addition to your Berbatov theory Wenger stepped in and took Robinho on loan.\" Now you're talking. Sadly, however, the reality is rather more mundane: Hull are hoping to seal a loan move for Rangers striker Daniel Cousin.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>2.32pm: </strong>The grinding of the Manchester rumour mill continues unabated. Mark Hughes has reportedly confirmed that City's bid for Dimitar Berbatov is genuine, and says that he is set to meet the broody Bulgarian for talks later today. What's more, he might even tear himself away from the golf course to do so.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>2.34pm: </strong>\"Is it me, or does Mark Hughes have a fantastic sense of humour?\" asks Gareth Bourne. \"His main activity today is scuppering his city rivals from getting the player they have coveted for a year. Berbatov won't want to go to City, though, because they are not in Big Cup - and Tottenham won't sell to United for a lesser amount if they have had a higher offer elsewhere.\" Fair point.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>2.39pm: </strong>\"Why do these super rich types only buy clubs who play in blue?\" muses Simon Martin. \"Is it that red was traditionally the colour of communists, and they are concerned that if they bought such a club their money could be used to purchase tractors which are then distributed to the poor of the parish?\" Any billionaires contemplating the bucking of that trend should address their enquiries to Mr R. Parry, Chief Executive, Anfield Road, Liverpool L4 0TH ...</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>2.45pm: </strong>While we're on the subject of Merseyside, Everton fans may be relieved to hear that Louis Saha has signed a two-year deal, with the option of a third, after passing his medical. Or they may not. Meanwhile, Stoke have apparently tabled a \u00a35m bid for Cardiff midfielder Joe Ledley. Tony Pulis also has a beady eye on Liverpool winger Jermaine Pennant, who would command a similar price.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>2.54pm: </strong>\"Chelsea defender Paolo Ferreira is currently talking to West Ham about a move down the table but in the starting XI,\" writes Pascal Hofmann, thoughtfully saving me the bother.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>2.59pm: </strong>\"Wigan Athletic's third choice keeper, Carlo Nash, looks set to become Everton's second choice keeper if the Liverpool Daily Post is to be believed,\" points out Adam Leier, continuing the good work begun by Pascal while even going one better by pointing me in the direction of <a href=\"http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/everton-fc/everton-fc-news/2008/09/01/everton-on-verge-of-signing-carlo-nash-from-wigan-athletic-64375-21649152/\">this piece from the Liverpool Daily Post</a>.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>3.04pm: </strong>If you Google 'Victor Nsofor Obinna', the following Wikipedia link tops the list: \"Victor Roger Charlie Zulu Nsofor Obinna (born March 25, 1987 in Jos, Nigeria) is a Nigerian footballer who plays as a striker for Everton.\" He doesn't. And he won't. Obinna's work permit application has been declined, scuppering a projected loan move to Goodison Park.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>3.08pm: </strong>Alex Walsh wins the award for the afternoon's first Louis Saha gag: \"Apparently Saha has broken his wrist signing the Everton contract this afternoon. He is expected to be out for the next four weeks.\" If Saha weren't so injury prone, would United fans - given the speculation surrounding Berbatov - be ruing Fergie's decision to bundle the French striker off to Goodison?</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>3.17pm: </strong>Unsurprisingly, the transfer antics of a certain Bulgarian are dominating your email contributions right now. A selection: \"If Man City are to sign Berbatov, how much of his decision to eschew the bright lights of the other side of Manchester might be attributed to the presence (and presumably persuasion) of Martin Petrov?\" (Stewart Airey); \"Wouldn't Spurs be shooting themselves in the foot by selling Berbatov to City? After all, it's much more likely that City are going to be their closest rivals this year - for UEFA cup, league position etc\" (Ben Wilkie); \"As a Spurs fan I would like to see Berbs sod off, and it would be funny if he went to Man City. Not only would we get more money, but Man Utd wouldn't get him. As long as the sulker goes - we've all had enough\" (Will Bouma - presumably not the Aston Villa model).</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>3.26pm: </strong>Moving lightly on, Giles Page wants to know \"if any<br>kind billionaires have decided to take over another club in blue - chiefly, Brighton? Any more transfers?\" Sadly for Seagulls fans, no. But watch this space, Giles, because boss Micky Adams had this to say after Saturday's goalless draw with Leyton Orient: \"After performances like that you have to consider every option. Maybe we will sit down and have a little think about things.\" Best get a move on, Mr Adams.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>3.35pm: </strong> BREAKING NEWS!!!! Manchester City's bid for Dimitar Berbatov is \u00a334m - not \u00a337m, \u00a330m-plus, or even \u00a37m more than the offer tabled by United. You heard it here first. Meanwhile, Mark Hughes has had this to say: \"We've made an offer and now it's about the boy making a decision. We're very excited about what's going on.\" Well, there's no accounting for taste.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>3.39pm: </strong>Stoke have agreed a fee to re-sign Danny Higginbotham, who left the Britannia Stadium for Sunderland last summer. Meanwhile, this tantalising snippet from Stephen Connelly: \"My brother-in-law, who works in a supermarket in Airdrie, has just phoned to tell me that Wayne Bridge was in his shop looking for the Hoops. He duly showed him the aisle where the spaghetti hoops are kept, but it was the green and white hoops of Celtic he was after. A one-year loan deal, I'm reliably told by Meat Counter Manager Mick Cronin.\" Don't you just love transfer deadline day?</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>3.44pm: </strong>... and here's another transfer gem, this time from Nicholas Cendrowicz: \"Apparently Steve Finnan has been transferred to Espanyol. That's what Marca is saying!\" Heady times, Nicholas; heady times.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>3.49pm: </strong>After making just one appearance for Wigan since his arrival from Sparta Rotterdam last summer, Dutch winger Rachid Bouaouzan if off to warm the bench at Eredivisie side NEC Nijmegen instead. Meanwhile, some well-earned gloating from David Hendry: \"Remember at <strong>11.40</strong> when you (your colleague) called my Berbatov to City story \"right old Bunkum\"? Well look at you all now!!! Ahahahahaaahhhaaahahahaa (Evil Mr Burns-esque crazed laugh of power).\" Fair dos, David.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>3.55pm: </strong>\"Hey, Roop,\" writes Alan Cooper, continuing a disturbing trend, \"how can you have missed the utterly thrilling news that Ipswich have signed Jon Stead on loan from Sheffield Utd? At least it has actually happened (unlike the Berbatov nonsense).\" How indeed? For the record, the deal will run until January and a fee has already been agreed should Ipswich boss Jim Magilton see fit to make the move permanent.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>4.05pm: </strong>Berbatov? Pah! \"Miguel \u00c1ngel Llera to the MK Dons - wow!\" enthuses Michael Garton. The Spanish defender joins from Spanish Second Division side Hercules CF. At least he will if he can successfully negotiate the 6,497 roundabouts that stand between the M1 and stadium:mk. Meanwhile, Zenit St Petersburg have declared - categorically, finally and irrevocably - that Andrei Arshavin will not be moving in this transfer window. Don't rejoice too soon, though: it simply means we'll have to revisit the whole wretched saga again come January.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>4.10pm: </strong>Steve Finnan's move to Espanyol has been confirmed. You wonder how that will go down with Liverpool fans - is Arbeloa really a better bet for the right-back slot than the classy Republic of Ireland international?</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>4.20pm: </strong>Interesting question from Liam Walsh, who writes: \"I was just wondering if Manchester City can actually make any signings today. Are they not bound by the 'due diligence' stuff that happens when someone takes over a club? Or did I miss all of that?\" Good point, Liam. City will indeed be bound by due diligence, but presumably there's nothing to stop the new owners injecting cash into the club up-front should they so wish.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>4.22pm: </strong>This just in from the increasingly indispensable Pascal Hofmann: \"Collins John is joining Bouaouzan in moving to NEC Nijmegen. The 22-year-old is on a free transfer from Fulham, pending a medical.\"</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>4.29pm: </strong>Remember Arsenal? Christiaan Hartsuiker does. \"So far only uninteresting clubs have signed uninteresting players, and all the hype has made the Berbatov transfer saga equally uninteresting, so all that I can think of being interesting is the potential totally out-of-the-blue signing Arsene Wenger will make today,\" writes a clearly uninterested Christian. In more interesting news - well, marginally - Bristol City have signed John Akinde from Ebbsfleet (or Gravesend and Northfleet, as some of us traditionalists still prefer to think of them). Akinde's switch makes a little piece of transfer history: it's the first to be decided by a club's support. 82.3% of Ebbsfleet's owners, myfootballclub.co.uk, voted in favour of letting the 19-year-old head for Ashton Gate.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>4.36pm: </strong>Ye gods and little fishes, as my fearsome sixth-form teacher used to say in primary school, what is going on with this Berbatov transfer? Oh, sorry - I'm meant to be telling you, aren't I? Well, I can tell you this: Berbatov has apparently been spotted at Manchester United's Carrington training ground. Looks like Mark Hughes can remain focussed on his golf after all.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>4.41pm: </strong> Liverpool's car-boot sale continues as Andriy Voronin packs his lead-lined strikers' boots and heads back to the Bundesliga. Hertha Berlin have agreed to take the Ukrainian on a season-long loan.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>4.45pm: </strong>\"Yes! Great news for Liverpool fans!\" purrs Alistair Cubbon, happily conceding that his undisguised delight over Voronin's departure does \"nothing for Anglo-German relations.\" Meanwhile, Southampton manager Jan Poortvliet has signed 21-year old attacker Romain Gasmi from RC Strasbourg. \"The midfielder currently has a broken foot but should still be more useful than Rudi Skacel,\" sighs Tony Lehrle-Fry.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>4.50pm: </strong>BREAKING NEWS!!! Reports are emerging from Spain that Real Madrid have made a \u00a336.5m bid for - cue drum roll - Dimitar Berbatov.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>4.54pm: </strong>I'm still trying to get my head round the latest twist in the Berbatov story. Still, let's be grateful for small mercies: at least this stultifying saga - in it's latest, three-headed format, at any rate - has been compressed into a few hours. \"Howdy The Roop/Rooper/El Rooperino (if you're not into the whole brevity thing),\" writes Michael Friel - who, I would venture, is a good deal less amusing than he might imagine - \"with Madrid now sticking their oar in the question has to be asked - is Berbatov that good? I mean, REALLY?\"</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>5.04pm: </strong>\"This transfer window has been horrendous for us,\" writes Liverpool fan Chris Marshall, still reeling from the sale of Steve Finnan. \"We've wasted weeks chasing a midfielder who isn't better than we already have, miserably failed to strengthen properly by buying players we actually need - like wingers - spanked \u00a320m on a very over-rated Irishman, and now just got rid of a very under-rated Irishman for sod all. Rafa is really testing our faith.\" What is it they say up your way, Chris? In Rafa we trust? For the sake of a competitive league, if nothing else, let's hope Benitez is a man with a plan.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>5.09pm: </strong>Tottenham are set to replace Dimitar Berbatov with ... Emile Heskey!!! And in a further twist, Dr Sulaiman Al-Fahim, the prospective new owner of Manchester City, has apparently revealed that - never mind Berbatov - the club have registered bids for Valencia's David Villa and Stuttgart's Mario Gomez.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>5.15pm: </strong>Goalkeeper Mark Bunn has joined Blackburn from Northampton for an undisclosed fee. Bunn, who has signed a four-year deal, was apparently whisked out of the reckoning for Northampton's weekend clash with Tranmere Rovers and told to head for Lancashire pronto. \"I'm absolutely delighted to be here,\" said Bunn. \"It is a dream come true really.\" Meanwhile, apropos of Berbatov's alleged presence at Carrington, David Savage wants to know: \"Was this just before Elvis arrived, or just after?\"</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>5.25pm: </strong>David Hendry, who first opened the can of worms containing a certain Mr Berbatov at <strong>11.40</strong> this morning, has stuck his head gingerly above the parapet to plead for forgiveness. \"I agree with Michael,\" says David, \"he isn't that good, and I thoroughly regret bringing everyone's attention to the article in the first place. Apologies.\" No need to be sorry, David - particularly given that Tottenham have apparently accepted City's offer.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>5.33pm: </strong>\"Heskey to replace Berba?\" stammers an incredulous Andres Tomlin. \"Please say it ain't so!! Surely with the additional \u00a310m in euros being thrown in our lap we can afford to make Zenit an offer they'd be daft to refuse.\" Apparently not, Andres - word is Zenit won't be allowing Arshavin to move until January at the earliest (see below, <strong>4.05pm</strong>).</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>5.36pm: </strong>\"Best transfer window news for Southend fans, watch us take League One!\" enthuses Paul Napper after learning - from <a href=\"http://www.thisiscroydontoday.co.uk/latestsport/Freedman-verge-Shrimpers-switch/article-300489-detail/article.html\">the Croydon Advertiser, no less</a> - that Crystal Palace striker Dougie Freedman is set to sign a two-year deal with the Shrimpers.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>5.44pm: </strong> Liverpool have confirmed the signing of winger Albert Riera from Espanyol on a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee. And Porto winger Ricardo Quaresma is now Inter Milan winger Ricardo Quaresma after signing a five-year deal with the Serie A champions; Pele - no, not that one - has headed in the opposite direction. \"Roopster,\" writes David Henry - whom I hold personally responsible for the fact that I've just received an email from a certain someone containing the words \"Roop-di-doo\" - \"does Mark Hughes know about any of <a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester_city/s/1064963_city_bid_for_villa_and_gomez\">this</a> or is he still playing golf?\" Who knows, Henry, who knows?</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>5.51pm: </strong>Liverpool fans may have their reservations about the Riera deal, but they aren't shared by Rafael Benitez. \"\"Riera has the qualities we were looking for,\" said Benitez following confirmation of the midfielder's arrival. \"He's a left footer who normally plays on the left wing, he's good in the air, strong, powerful and a good crosser of the ball. He's the kind of player we have been talking about. He can beat players and get good deliveries into the area for our strikers.\"</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>5.55pm: </strong>West Brom have confirmed the loan signing of Ryan Donk, the AZ Alkmaar defender. Joey Barton is apparently being pursued by a top-10 Premier League club. And Tom Soares, the Crystal Palace midfielder, is on his way to Stoke to discuss personal terms after the two clubs agreed a fee.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>6.04pm: </strong>Jonathan Grounds, the Middlesbrough defender, has joined Norwich on a three-month loan. Joel Shippey, however, has more pressing matters on his mind. \"Is no one else worried by Rafa's statement that Riera 'normally' plays on the left wing?\" he wonders. \"Given his track record recently, I expect to see Riera at right-back next week.\"</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>6.11pm: </strong>Marca claim that Diego Milito has returned to Genoa from Real Zaragoza, who have also reportedly signed Palermo's Bosko Jankovic on loan. Not that Paul Moser cares. \"In the absence of any top rated footballers here in Paris (including all of the PSG team), I've been reduced to looking up what 'roop' means. It is to make a hoarse sound. And 'narine' means nostril in French. Need I go on?\" Thanks all the same, Paul, but I think we'd best leave it there.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>6.18pm: </strong>\"For Berbatov, a fitness-test consists of visiting as many teams as possible in one day,\" quips Ian Copestake. Latest word is that Berbatov has met with Lord Fergie at Carrington - despite the fact that he doesn't have permission to do so, Tottenham having only agreed a fee with Man City.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>6.25pm: </strong>\"Liverpool are so desperate for a left-winger I'd be happy if they signed Michael Foot,\" sighs Nath Jones. Jonathan Norman, however, is more worried about Andriy Voronin's departure from Anfield. \"I don't see how getting rid of Voronin is a good thing for Liverpool if he isn't replaced,\" says Jonathan. \"He really wasn't that bad a backup and we now have only a 19-year-old Frenchman, barely out of his football diapers, as replacement for Torres, who is currently injured. I remain unconvinced.\"</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>6.34pm: </strong>It's not just Liverpool fans who are disillusioned with the day's transfer dealings. \"On Saturday's showing, Dougie Freedman would have to average three to four goals a game for us to stay up,\" laments Southend fan Bryan Pugs. \"And after the unbearable drabness of the summer transfer window, wouldn't it be better to condense the whole thing into one day?\" It feels like they did, Bryan.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>6.41pm: </strong>Birmingham midfielder Sone Aluko is heading north after Aberdeen secured a deal to bring the 19-year-old, who spent last season on loan at the club, back to Pittodrie. \"Hello there Roop Doggy-dog,\" writes Tim Travers, the latest man to push his luck when it comes to naming names. \"I see that after the City farce Thaksin Shinawatra is to remain at the club as honorary president. Given his record isn't that a bit like Newcastle making Joey Barton their goodwill ambassador?\"</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>6.55pm: </strong>Arsenal fans desperate for news of a last-minute signing can forget about Gokhan Inler. The Swiss international has signed a contract extension with Udinese that should keep him at the club until the end of the 2012/13 campaign. \"I never had any doubts,\" said Inler. \"From the first day I was certain I would remain at Udinese.\" He might have said so sooner.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>7.10pm:</strong> As the technical gremlins with which we began this epic return, last word goes to Archi Campbell: \"We could call you Lord Rhoop, after the crazed Narnian nobleman found by the voyagers of the dawntreader in the land where nightmares come true. Which is how you could end up if Man City keep distorting the laws of reality like this.\" Not too sure about the first point, Archi, but the second I'll give you. Which is why I'm now going to hand my rough and all unable pen to Josh Widdicombe, who is neither rough or unable and will guide you through the remaining few hours before the transfer window slams shut.

There are players considering moving clubs that aren't called Robinho or Dimitar Berbatov. No, really. Cristian Ionita, confirms it: \"You should know that Steaua Bucharest signed George Ogararu (Ajax Amsterdam, RB) and Antonio Semedo (CFR Cluj, FW). About a million euros each. Isn't this a lot more interesting than the Real-ManCity-ManUtd jibber-jabber?\" It certainly is, particularly because you have listed the players as if they are on Championship Manager, Cristian.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>7.49pm</strong> An email from a disgruntled Evertonian (no not Naylor): \"Everton had NINE senior pros fit on Saturday,\" writes Pierluigi Orlandini. \"So far we've signed an injured striker and a pensionable goalkeeper, yet we finished fifth in the League, semis of the Carling Cup and decent run in UEFA. What is the Board and manager playing at?\" Don't worry Pierluigi, I bring news of a bid, one of \u00a33.5m for Stephen Hunt. Let's overlook that it was rejected shall we?</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>7.54pm</strong> Hibernian have re-signed Derek Riordan, Hearts dropped out of the race about half an hour ago. let's be honest, they knew they had no chance but were just saving face, like when Andy Cole retired from international football. We have a eBay description for Berbatov from the ever-reliable George Templeton: \"Prime goal-scorer with big forehead available. Sometimes prone to moodswings and the occasional sulk, cured by huge piles of cash. Starting price \u00a325 million.\"</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>8.01pm</strong> It was a three-year contract for Riordan is anyone was wondering, someone must have been. \"Joey Barton is being pursued by a top 10 Premier League club (5.55pm) - Is it Arsenal, with big sticks?\" Arfs Hugh Macguire.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>8.04pm</strong> Guess who Man City have been linked with now? Robinho. You couldn't make it up, though Real Madrid mouthpiece Marca just have. No really, they are reporting it on Sky.

'Offered: one piece of striking furniture. Very elegant but possibly unreliable legs. New owner must collect,'\" writes Jack Lee. Is having a report at the Tottenham training ground really going to help Sky break any news on Berbatov at all? It is dark and everyone has clearly gone home. I have a feel Berbatov's not going to return there anytime soon.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>8.14pm</strong> Two potential deals for Hull today and here we go with confirmation on them ... Daniel Cousin has signed from Rangers on a three-year deal.

Yes, signed him, actual news, I knew such a thing existed. \"As one person who was interested, thank you for the Riordan info,\" writes Derek Adamson. No worries Derek, all part of the service, anything else you wanted to discuss? \"Yes Josh, any news on Ashton to Villa though?\" Nope.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>8.22pm</strong> Burnley have signed Steve Thompson from Cardiff for free. Talking of cheap ... \"I've just transferred \u00a375 from my savings to my current account to see me through until my payday which is 2 weeks off,\" boom booms Kevin Rainey, who theguardian.com's Alan Gardner has just described as a frugal miser for such cheap living antics.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>8.25pm</strong> According to Sky Joey Barton is at St James' Park \"thrashing out his future\". Surely that is not the most responsible verb to use when discussing Barton.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>8.29pm</strong> If anyone is enjoying this wonderful day of dealing too much, then here is the email for you: \"Seems like the last days of Rome, what with a global economic crisis, the premier league are looking to collectively spank 100s of millions on overrated, overvalued ball-kickers - must make hard up fans really happy to hand over \u00a340 a match,\" writes Rich Holman over strains of Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>8.36pm</strong> NON-TRANSFER NEWS: Kevin Bond has been sacked by Bournmouth. But what does that mean for Dimitar Berbatov? Nothing. Meanwhile, Mark Hughes has spent his day playing golf while Alex Ferguson picked Berbatov up from the airport. I just can't work out who he is going to join. In class-war news, Kevin Rainey is not taking Alan Gardner's abuse lying down: \"Guilty as charged ... unfortunately I'm not paid the vast sums available to the sandle wearing brigade at Guardian Towers, meaning it beans on toast from here on out (thats baked beans not mung beans by the way),\" he writes.

No time wasters\" while Peter Richards goes with: \"Bulgarian import, well rested, guaranteed to demand attention.\" I think we should call an end to this Berbatov chat, I hereby refuse to write his name again until something actually happens.</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>8.55pm</strong> According to Sky's man on the ground the body language at the Britannia Stadium hints that they aren't signing Jermaine Pennant (no, I have no idea either). However, they are signing Danny Higginbottom and Tom Soares has just turned up. Meanwhile, the wonderful Plymouth Argyle are close to signing Glen Whelan from them. It's all gone there. And here is more news from Sky's man at the Britannia, Emile Heskey is possibly moving to Aston Villa (Once again, no, I have no idea either).</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>9pm</strong> Ok, Man City news. It's from good sources. Forget Villa and Gomez, they have not made bids for them. But a bid has been made for a certain Bulgarian and Robinho. Is that news? It'll have to be, it's all I have.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>9.05pm</strong> Many emails about when Berbatov Deadline Day actually ends. Jut to be clear it is midnight, when he will turn into a pumpkin, or perhaps sign for a Manchester club (perhaps not Stockport). One further complication: \"Do you realize that in some parts of the world it is tomorrow already and all this is over,\" writes Mark Judd. If any of you readers live in any of these places can you just email me to tell me where Berbatov went and then we can all go home. Cheers.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>9.07pm</strong> Apparently there are rumours now that Michael Owen is going to ... guess who? Manchester City. Well, after telling me that Sky have just told me it's rubbish. Why tell me in the first place then? In Heskey news, we are all still clueless. Clueless!</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>9.12pm</strong> Stoke have signed Danny Higginbottom. Confirmed. Pop those champagne corks Potters fans, it's all true. And here is some more news from a certain sport based TV channel, Martin O'Neill's phone is going straight to answer phone. No, really. What a day to forget to charge your mobile, nightmare. I can however confirm he is pushing through the Emile Heskey deal via Facebook chat.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>9.18pm</strong> Tony Pullis is going transfer mad, Joe Ledley hoping to become their 48th transfer of the day. Meanwhile there is a new face in the Berbatov race: \"We've had a whip-round in the lab,\" writes Dave Booth of the Derpartment of Physiology at the University of Liverpool (shouldn't he be doing some research or something). \"We've got a bid of 9.56 ... er ... pounds, 47 Polish Zlotys, half a pack of chocolate Hob-Nobs and a cactus named Rex. We're looking for a one-in one-out deal for our own eastern European who's no-so good in the air. Take it or leave it Spurs, the Hob-Nobs aren't getting any fresher.\" Well, I have heard Berbatov has been spotted in the north-west, that I can confirm. The plot thickens.</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>9.27pm</strong> Everton have signed Carlo Nash. Message ends.</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>9.32pm</strong> \"Surely Martin O'Neill's phone might just be engaged?\" Says Eddie Robson and he might be right. There is only one way to sort this out, does any have Martin O'Neill's number?</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>9.36pm</strong> Berbatov has arrived at Old Trafford, I think he might be about to sign for them. Maybe. \"Any fool knows that the real game is now called Football Manager after the makers of the original CM, SI Games lost the rights to the name. The game known as Championship Manager these days is but a pale imitation,\" writes Jeff Black. I gave up after the 97/98 version, Jeff. The pinnacle of management simulation and no transfer deadline until March in those days.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>9.45pm</strong> The next person who emails me to say they have seen Berbatov in an amusing place and that he is now signing for someone unlikely is going to get a strongly worded reply. Though a special mention for Stewart Harper for an excellent joke about Bulgarian cigarettes.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>9.51pm</strong> I will be honest, we are in a lull. Where is Tony Pullis when you need him? Nothing, absolutely nothing, is happening.</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>9.53pm</strong> \"I recall that in CM 97/98 edition (I agree; undoubtedly the pinnacle of football management games) you could bid as much as you wanted for a player, then when the club inevitably accepted your \u00a320 million offer, you could revise it down to \u00a30 and get the player for free,\" writes Ed Bayling. \"Perhaps this is strategy Citeh are following today?\" We'll never know, it looks like they won't be signing anyone at this rate.</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>10pm</strong> Just TWO HOURS to go now. And as we speak Sir Alex Ferguson and Dimitar Berbatov are in conversation, presumably about him signing for them but that is only speculation. But here we go, this is the big one, a deal has been AGREED for Robinho to move to Manchester City, \u00a332m. Wow, what you going to do about that Chelsea?</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>10.05pm</strong> So, the big news is Robinho is moving to Manchester City. The credit for this must go to the emaillers who all sent me the link to the Spanish site that reported this, sadly I can't speak Spanish so that is why i was a bit slow on the uptake.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>10.08pm</strong> To those that have asked for me to clear up the Berbatov cigarette joke from Stewart Harper earlier. I can't, it is not website-ready. It is very funny though. In terms of Championship Manager 97/98, the real story of the day, \"Two words. Ibrahima. Bakayoko,\" writes Paul Ansorge. \"It was always rumoured that Walter Smith only signed him because of how good he was in 97/98.\"</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>10.12pm</strong> There is a rumour that Frazier Campbell will be heading to Tottenham in part exchange for a certain person. Surely not. Meanwhile Stoke have upped their bid for for Joe Ledley to \u00a36m. That is a lot of honk for a Championship player.</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>10.15pm</strong> Joey Barton is staying at Newcastle, his move to \"a top ten Premier League club\" fell at the final hurdle.</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>10.17pm</strong> Richard Jeffries has sent me this brilliant link: <a href=\"http://www.manutd.com/publish.sps?pagegid=%7BFE60904B-C2A8-4E60-9B05-700DBBC29BBC%7D&amp;teamid=443&amp;section=playerProfile&amp;bioid=4130\">here</a></p> <p>I have no idea if it is fake? But I can confirm the big news, he will be wearing number nine.</p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>10.22pm</strong> More link fun, for those that requested a Spanish article on Robinho going to City, here you are: <a href=\"http://www.as.com/futbol/articulo/robinho-manchester-city/dasftb/20080901dasdasftb_28/Tes\">link</a></p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>10.25pm</strong> Don't forget that it is easy to fake these kind of <a href=\"http://www.manutd.com/publish.sps?pagegid=%7BFE60904B-C2A8-4E60-9B05-700DBBC29BBC%7D&amp;teamid=443&amp;section=playerProfile&amp;bioid=4299\">pages</a>. in conclusion we know no more than we did this morning. In other news Alexei Smertin has had his contract terminated with just 95 minutes to find a new club.</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>10.30pm</strong> So it looks like that site was a fake then, how embarrassing. I have received around 400 emails of other examples of players there are pages for. My favourite, Marlon Brooms. He was excellent in Champ Man 97/98 coincidently.</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>10.35pm</strong> For those questioning the Spanish link for the Robinho story, they are all over it on Sky Sports too. So believe. News from Richard Graveling, \"Norwich have signed Antoine Sibierski on loan from Wigan, it's on the club website. That's the big one! I can go to bed now,\" night Richard.</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>10.39pm</strong> You know what I told you about Daniel Cousin moving to Hull earlier, it was true. All t's crossed and i's dotted etc. By the way, ignore that Spanish article, as has been pointed out by many, many, many people they still think Sven Goran-Eriksson is the Manchester City manager. Robinho is still City bound though.</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>10.44pm</strong> \"If the link Spanish-speakers are sending is by notoriously unreliable AS newspaper, said news story says that he is going to Sven Goran Eriksson's City ... which I assume is Cancun, Mexico ... \" boom booms Duncan Bishop.</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>10.49pm</strong> Joey Barton has apparently texted into Sky to say he wanted to stay at Newcastle all along. The age we live in, huh? I have yet to receive a text myself, but then he hasn't got my number.</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>10.55pm</strong> Transfer news from Holland via Pascal Hofmann: \"Ooijer and AZ Alkmaar. Well, it's official, that deal is off. And, Danny Blind is keeping his (and my) word and will still not be selling Huntelaar, even though \"astronomic offers\" have been made, according to NOS.nl.\" See, I have contacts!</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>10.59pm</strong> \"Unattached players can be signed after the window closes so you needn't worry about Alexei Smertin, not that I suspect anyone was,\" writes James Hudson. Phew. So, only an hour left, what will happen?</p> <!-- Block 134 --> <p><strong>11.02pm</strong> Julian Gray has moved from Coventry to Fulham. Elsewhere, fans ourside the City of Stadium are singing \"we've got Robinho, we've got Robinho etc\". That is evidence enough for me. As for Berbatov, it is just a matter of time as we all know.</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>11.06pm</strong> News from Spain: \"Spanish TV have the Robinho story, to city for 40 million euros. And Calderon saying it is best for both the player and the club,\" writes Brad in Valencia. While Pablo Requejo writes: \"Real Madrid\u00b4s president is now speaking and he has said than Robinho has been sold to Manchester City. Transfer made by \u20ac42m. He said that Cristiano Ronaldo maybe could land in Real Madrid next year.\" Let's not even get into that one.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>11.10pm</strong> Robinho news: \"We have agreed to sell the player for human reasons, and for footballing reasons and for an important quantity of money,\" Real president Ramon Calderon told Spanish television station VEO. \"After consulting with the technical staff we have decided it was the best decision for the group and the club.\" But who has he been sold to?</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>11.12pm</strong> REAL MADRID HAVE CONFIRMED THEY HAVE AGREED TO SELL ROBINHO TO MAN CITY. I didn't think I'd be writing that when I woke up this morning.</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>11.16pm</strong> Some more transfers not containing Robinho and Berbatov, a change is as good as a rest. \"Two Belgian sites are now saying it's a done deal for Fellaini to go to Goodison \u2013 The first decent bit of progress for us toffees all day,\" writes Hugh Watson, who loses marks for referring to me as Widdyroo. \"There are some rumours over here in Sweden that Ola Toivonens agent, former player Martin Dahlin, is closing in on transfer deal with Stoke,\" writes Go22at, which might not be his real name but an email pseudonym.</p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>11.19pm</strong> Berbatov will wear the number nine shirt, didn't I tell you.</p> <!-- Block 140 --> <p><strong>11.23pm</strong> Frazier Campbell is on his way to Spurs, so says <a href=\"http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/sportpreview/Breaking-news-Fraizer-Campbell-Tottenham-Hull-City/article-301068-detail/article.html\">this</a>. Thanks to Gary Robinson for that, excellent work.</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>11.25pm</strong> Poor old Arsenal, Mike Johnson sums up the mood of the emails I have received from Gooners tonight: \"Why haven't you written anything about Arsenal signing anyone better than Abou Diaby. Why? I'm going to fly to London from Philadelphia and fight Arsene Wenger if nothing happens in the next 40 minutes.\" think about your carbon footprint Mike, it's not worth it.</p> <!-- Block 142 --> <p><strong>11.30pm</strong> News from Wolves, via the very helpful Tom Bason: \"Why no mention of the transfer goings on at Molineux? George Friend (there must be a pun in there for you somewhere!!) signs from Exeter and Matt Hill and Stephen Elliott switch clubs in two allegedly completely unrelated transfers. It's a hotbed of activity- how many other clubs have signed no fewer than three defenders today?\" And as I type that ROBINHO HAS SIGNED FOR MANCHESTER CITY.</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>11.33pm</strong> \"Does nobody else realise that Police Academy 1 is on right now?\" Asks Anthony Browne.</p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>11.34pm</strong> In my attempts to make this website appeal to football fans from outside the Greater Manchester area, here is some news from Stoke. They probably won't get Joe Ledley, they might get Tom Soares or even Michael Tonge though. And ... and ... they may add Henry Camara to that. Come on Pullis, get a move on.</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>11.39pm</strong> And not sure how true this is but it is a transfer free-for-all now in my email inbox. \"Aston Villa have sealed a deal with Swedish team Malmo FF over Ola Toivonen and the price is believed to be around 1.6\u00a3 million. They hijacked him in a last minute bid, infront of Stoke who have been interested. Ola Toivonen have played in the same clubs as the Swedish internationals Olof Mellberg (Degerfors)and Markus Allback (\u00d6rgryte)who probably have told him good things about the club.

I'm loving all the Man City stories from out here in Sydney. What? Eh? Oh \u2026 \" writes Gavin Hudson, somewhat predictably. I'll be honest, we're playing out time now, time for one more big transfer?</p> <!-- Block 147 --> <p><strong>11.48pm</strong> I'm waiting ... only 12 minutes to sign that deal</p> <!-- Block 148 --> <p><strong>11.50pm:</strong> The latest Frazier Who? news: \"Despite the BBC having the Campbell to Spurs story as well (we had it first). Sky seem to think its Hull may still sign him. Mind you the reporter did start referring to Frazier Richardson halfway through his report. Is this Richardson any good?

I don't expect him to cause much of an impact Gary.</p> <!-- Block 149 --> <p><strong>11.53pm</strong> \"Reports on the radio here in Melbourne, that Everton have signed Green Gully (Australian A league) striker, John Markovski,\" writes Gavin Knight.

I'll be here until about 1am.</p> <!-- Block 155 --> <p><strong>12.10am</strong> Not much happening though.</p> <!-- Block 156 --> <p><strong>12.13am</strong> I'm just going to join Dimitar Berbatov in a cigarette for five minutes while everyone chews over these words from Mark Hughes: \"I am absolutely delighted to get the opportunity to work with such an incredible talent like Robinho. I have said that in order to compete with the best teams in the Premier League we have to be in the market for players of this calibre, and Robinho is undoubtedly one of the best players in the world. I am really looking forward to introducing him to the rest of the squad, and to the City fans at the earliest opportunity. This is a real statement of intent as to the ambitions of Manchester City Football Club\"</p> <!-- Block 157 --> <p><strong>12.25am</strong> Me again. Just to confirm there is no actual statement on Berbatov, but we are pretty sure he has signed on the say so of people more in the know than us. And here is some news for Newcastle fans, striker Xisco has signed from Deportivo on a five-year deal. He's a Spanish under-21 striker for those who have never heard of him.</p> <!-- Block 158 --> <p><strong>12.30am</strong> Stoke have failed with Joe Ledley and Henri Camara but they have signed Tom Soares from Crystal Palace and Michael Tonge from Sheffield United. Not a bad hit rate, better than Chelsea's.</p> <!-- Block 159 --> <p><strong>12.36am</strong> Nothing official on Berbatov, but he has left in a car from Old Trafford and here is some news ... Frazier Campbell has gone to Spurs on a season-long loan and BERBATOV HAS SIGNED FOR MANCHESTER UNITED FOR \u00a330.7m. At last.</p> <!-- Block 160 --> <p><strong>12.40am</strong> And I think just about brings an end to this wonderful evening of gossip and dealing.

  "<p>In <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaedrus\">Phaedrus</a>'s well-known fable of the wolf and the lamb, the wolf could easily have eaten the lamb without a word, but prefers to set out his \"reasons\". First, he scolds the lamb for muddying his drinking water (even though the wolf was upstream). Then he argues that last year the lamb had called him bad names (but the lamb was only six months old). The wolf then snarls that if it was not the lamb, it was his father; after that, he immediately moves into action. </p> <p>The wolf's \"justifications\" for his evil action were a luxury that he allowed himself. At present, the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/\">United Nations Charter</a> legally binds wolf-states \u2013 that is, the Great Powers \u2013 to offer justifications for their use of armed violence. This is all the more necessary for the Security Council's five permanent members because, aside from condemnation by public opinion, no sanctions are available against them for any serious breach of the charter. </p> <p>Russia has set forth various reasons to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/26/davidcameron.georgia\">justify</a> its armed intervention in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/26/davidcameron.georgia\">Georgia</a> where the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia are nonetheless under Georgian sovereignty. Russia argues that its invasion was aimed at (1) stopping Georgia's aggression against South Ossetians; (2) ending ethnic cleansing, genocide, and war crimes committed by Georgia there; (3) protecting Russian nationals; and (4) defending South Ossetians on the basis of the peace-keeping agreement signed by Boris Yeltsin and Eduard Shevardnadze in 1992. </p> <p>None of these legal grounds holds water. By sending its troops to South Ossetia, Georgia no doubt was politically reckless, but it did not breach any international rule, however nominal its sovereignty may be. Nor do genocide or ethnic cleansing seem to have occurred; if war crimes were perpetrated, they do not justify a military invasion. Moreover, South Ossetians have Russian nationality only because Russia recently bestowed it on them unilaterally. Finally, the <a href=\"http://rfe.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/2/4F5D153D-4136-43DC-8559-68570797C994.html\">1992 agreement</a> authorises only monitoring of internal tensions, not massive use of military force. </p> <p>Hence, as in Phaedrus's fable, the Kremlin's \"justifications\" are empty. Russia has breached Article 2 of the UN Charter, which enjoins member states to \"refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.\" </p> <p>There are several morals to the tale. First, when a lamb like Georgia gets smart and requests the protection of another wolf \u2013 in this case Nato \u2013 he must be careful, for every wolf guards his territory and is bent on \"protecting\" all those lambs that fall under his \"jurisdiction\".<br> Second, although Great Powers are de facto unbound by international rules on the use of force, they abide by a sort of unwritten \"agreement between scoundrels\" to behave similarly. The west violated that agreement in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/apr/18/balkans3\">1999 in Kosovo</a>: Nato powers first attacked Kosovo and Belgrade, in breach of the UN Charter (although they were morally justified to do so, because there was a need to stop the serious atrocities underway); the west then promoted and blessed Kosovo's secession. As a result of that perilous precedent, Russia no longer feels bound by the unwritten agreement. </p> <p>Finally, because it is mostly civilians that have suffered and are still suffering in Georgia, it is imperative for the world community to promote a lasting solution, as is stipulated in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/16/georgia.russia2\">agreement promoted by French President Nicolas Sarkozy</a>. But a lasting solution is nowhere in sight, because Russian forces, in blatant breach of that agreement \u2013 and of international customary law \u2013 remain in many parts of Georgia beyond Abkhazia and South Ossetia. These two regions have now proclaimed their independence, and Moscow has given its blessing to a secession that is likely to be the stepping stone to incorporation by Russia. </p> <p>Georgia has taken the path that lambs (small countries) normally choose when facing wolves (major powers), brandishing law as a weapon. It has instituted <a href=\"http://www.unpo.org/content/view/8521/236/\">legal proceedings against Russia</a> before both the International Court of Justice for alleged violations of the UN Convention on Racial Discrimination and the European Court of Human Rights for alleged breaches of Articles 2 (right to life) and 3 (prohibiting inhuman and degrading treatment) of the European Convention on Human Rights. Because Georgia is a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, it could have requested the ICC Prosecutor to investigate Russia's allegations of war crimes and genocide as well as its own allegations of Russian crimes. Strangely, it has not done so, though, fortunately, the ICC Prosecutor has announced that he is keeping the situation in Georgia \"under analysis\".<br> Plainly, by itself the law may not be able to offer the right solution in such a complex and dangerous situation. Only politics and diplomacy can offer a lasting solution. Nevertheless, with both sides claiming the mantle of international law, authoritative legal decisions about these issues might perhaps push the parties to reach a lasting agreement. </p> <p><em>Antonio Cassese, the first President of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and later the chairperson of the United Nations' International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur, teaches law at the University of Florence. </em></p> <p><strong>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</strong></p>",
  "<p>As the red carpet is readied for the 17th anniversary of Uzbekistan's independence from the Soviet Union on September 1, for the majority of the population the euphoria of the freedom celebrations is countered by the ruthless suppression of citizen and civil society freedoms.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.umid.uz/Main/Uzbekistan/Constitution/constitution.html\">constitution of Uzbekistan</a> emphatically guarantees citizens the right to engage in public life by holding rallies, meetings and demonstrations. In practice, however, any attempts by citizens to peacefully gather to express opinions on public affairs are consistently met with stiff official resistance and hurriedly dispersed by government troops. Democratic dissent is countered by official intimidation and harassment including arbitrary detention. Activist Mutabar Tojiboyeva, who was awarded this year's Martin Ennals award for human rights, was forced to spend nearly <a href=\"http://us.oneworld.net/article/release-ailing-uzbek-rights-activist-demanded\">three years in prison</a> because she dared to question the tragic <a href=\"http://www.iansa.org/regions/scasia/andijan.htm\">2005 massacre</a> of over 500 protestors by security forces in Andijan. To date, no officials have been held responsible for the widespread loss of life. Mutabar was providing support to the victims and their family members at the time of her arrest. She was ill-treated and subject to constant torture in prison. As a result, her health deteriorated significantly. Mutabar was finally released in March this year after considerable international pressure. Although she continues to serve a suspended sentence, she remains firm in her resolve to continue to speak out against official excesses. </p> <p>At the time of writing, another civil society voice, poet and thinker Yusuf Juma, who had the courage to protest peacefully against the controversial re-election of President Karimov in December 2007, is currently serving a four-year prison term. Juma's family alleges that he has been <a href=\"http://www.frontlinedefenders.org/node/1381\">tortured severely</a>. His 22-year-old son, who was also arrested by the authorities, is missing. The official version is that he escaped. The family fears much worse.<br> The extent of suppression of civil liberties in Uzbekistan can be gauged by the restrictive Rules of Holding Mass Events brought into force in 2003 to regulate the freedom of assembly. The rules avoid any mention of the constitutional freedom to organise street marches, pickets and demonstrations. Instead, the definition of mass events is limited to \"theatrical entertainment, concert, sport, advertising and other entertaining programmes, along with the celebration of national, religious and professional events\". As a result, the legislation fails to recognise legitimate forms of public protest that are both regionally and internationally accepted. In addition, organisers are required to obtain permission from the authorities to hold any event at least one month in advance. The application is then passed through various government departments in a complicated and time-consuming approval process. Even if an event is allowed, representatives from the secret service and the Ministry of the Interior then maintain constant surveillance during the proceedings for possible threats to \"social order and safety\". They are allowed to summarily call off an event at any time. Additionally, to keep public assemblies under constant surveillance, organisers of mass events are required to allocate a minimum of 10 seats in each section and a seat in each row for members of the territorial organs of the internal security services and the national security service. </p> <p>Moreover, there are severe restrictions on the freedom to associate and carry out civil society activities. NGOs must compulsorily register before being allowed to function. Permission to register is often subjectively denied, particularly to those organisations that are likely to offer independent views and legitimate criticism of official policies. For instance, pickets and demonstrations organised by the unregistered Human Rights Defenders Alliance of Uzbekistan in the last three years have been constantly disbanded by the police and national security service troops, followed by arrests and physical assaults on participants. After each weekly protest, these <a href=\"http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR620132005?open&amp;of=ENG-UZB\">human rights defenders</a> are detained for periods ranging from hours to several days. Their homes are under constant surveillance. Random searches and administrative penalties are routine occurrences. Aside from NGOs, faith-based groups and professional associations also undergo extensive scrutiny and harassment. Between 2003 to 2007, there were 300 confirmed <a href=\"http://www.groundreport.com/Arts_and_Culture/NGO-Numbers-Wane-in-Uzbekistan\">closures of civil society organisations</a>. </p> <p>Given the prevailing environment, independence day celebrations ring hollow.

  "<p><br>A bathtub full of disco paste ... Italo-disco duo Sebastian Muravchik and Ali Renault, AKA Heartbreak</p> <p>When I think of Italo-disco my mind conjures up images of suave men in cream suits, with big fake-gold medallions floating in a sea of swarthy chest hair, playboys smoking cigars in ornate hot tubs in the Italian Alps, and white tigers chained to Ferraris. But that's just me.</p> <p>What's genuinely strange and intriguing though, is to find that the genre has been having something of a renaissance of late, in the dingy pubs and run-down clubs of Dalston and Hackney.</p> <p>Dalston club nights <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/discobloodbathdisco\">Disco Bloodbath</a> and <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/latenightaudio\">Late Night Audio</a> are playing their part, but the night which initiated the Italo revival is Cocadisco, run by two very un-Italian chaps called Piers Martin and Rodaidh McDonald. After quite a long hiatus, <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=21325549845&amp;ref=mf\">Cocadisco</a> started up again last November in a pub in Hackney called the Dolphin. I was at some of the first few nights and initially it was quite a low-key affair - the pool table pushed to one side, covered with a board, but still with more than enough room to play pool. Word soon got around.</p> <p>As the office workers leave the City behind and head to Shoreditch to \"let off steam\" by running up and down Brick Lane in Borat mankinis and fairy wings at 4am screaming at the top of their lungs, the kids are all heading up to Dalston and Hackney. And one place many of them settled was Cocadisco. A few months into the Hackney residency, the place was heaving. I remember standing in the smoking area on more than one occasion (I don't smoke, but it was uncomfortably busy inside) and seeing people sweep down off the top of the 10ft-high perimeter wall like clumsy ninjas, desperate to beat the hour-long queue.</p> <p>The night moved this summer to a dilapidated basement club in Dalston called Visions. But it still remains as popular as ever - such as the event taking place this Friday, September 5 with special guest David Vunk - and the setting is much more fun.</p> <p>Italo-disco began in the early 1980s when producers like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHaszuleTu8&amp;feature=related\">Casco</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eML6_RZao-w\">Kano (not the Kate Nash-collaborating grime MC, unfortunately)</a> began making poppy futuristic disco with melancholy melodies, weird sounds and unorthodox production techniques.</p> <p>\"I'd say Italo was mainly about creating an illusion, one of raw and passionate fantasy, of wealth, fun, romance and sorrow - all the essential attributes of brilliant pop music,\" explains Cocadisco's Piers Martin.</p> <p>Early mass-produced drum machines and synths were used to make quite experimental music, but with a classic-pop sensibility. Producers and singers in places like Milan and Verona would work in studios like charismatic battery hens, bashing out what they hoped would be hits played for the kids at the local nightclubs. These songs were then pressed up and distributed by the <a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/label/Discomagic+Records\">Discomagic</a> company in Milan.</p> <p>It was probably quite a dull job for the artists, but nowadays the fans and collectors romanticise these records and pay hundreds of pounds for 12-inch singles from the halcyon era of 1983-4.</p> <p>The term Italo-disco wasn't coined until around 1985, when a German called Bernhard Mikulski, who ran the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZYX_Music\">ZYX label</a>, decided there should be a name to market this type of music. By 1988, it had disfigured mainly into Eurodance, Hi-NRG and Italo-house.</p> <p>Italo's influence can be heard in the music of groups like the Pet Shop Boys, New Order and Erasure, but it never really made it big the UK. That might be about to change though. London-based duo <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/heartbreak1\">Heartbreak</a> - comprising of singer Sebastian Muravchik and producer Ali Renault - are set to release their debut album, Lies, on Lex Records later this month.</p> <p>If an album that sounds like being transported to 1984 Rimini inside a hand-scuplted marble bath tub filled with a mixture of uncut Bolivian cocaine and Veuve Clicquot Champagne (AKA \"disco paste\") is your kind of thing, you should check it out.</p>"
