  "<p>It's a superpower confrontation in a region criss-crossed with oil pipelines vital to the west. So why, amid normally feverish speculation on London and New York markets, did the oil price continue its fall despite Russia's army marching through Georgia?</p> <p>Over the past month, the price of Brent crude has fallen 24%. Meanwhile shares in banks, shattered over the past year by the credit crunch, have started recovering. Barclays and HSBC have jumped 30%-40% from lows. Even housebuilder Barratt has tripled in price in three weeks afer an initial battering from falling house prices.</p> <p>What's going on? Is the great credit crunch trade - in which shares in energy, commodity and emerging market stocks have soared while financials and western consumer stocks have sunk - now over? Will, as some predict, the oil price now track back below $100? Or is this a blip before we stagger into credit crunch part two, as Europe follows the US into recession?</p> <p>According to Merrill Lynch's monthly fund manager survey, a closely-watched barometer of sentiment among the people who really control the London stockmarket, a tectonic shift is happening.</p> <p>The net number of fund managers who were overweight in oil and gas fell sharply in July from 52% to 11%. Meanwhile the number underweight in banks pulled back from 57% to 40%.</p> <p>Bill Mott, of Psigma Income, is a leading fund manager who in July, days before oil started falling and banks started rising, declared we were at the biggest \"inflection point\" in markets for 25 years.</p> <p>But unlike Merrill Lynch, which thinks the swing back to bank stocks is overdone, Mott believes UK consumer and financial stocks represent fundamental value, while the commodity/emerging market theme is history.</p> <p>\"The bullish argument from those still buying into commodity stocks is that long-term demand for natural resources from emerging markets (e.g. China and India) is going to drive up endlessly the price of those commodities. However, it is also the potential case that these price rises will put pressure on inflation rates everywhere and, with western central banks hawkish on inflation, that will cause over-indebted western economies to be plunged into recession or stagflation.</p> <p>\"The mindset is almost as extreme as 'companies which are close to the consumer in the UK, US and Europe etc will never be able to make decent returns again.' Meanwhile, natural resource stocks make up close to 40% of the weighting in the FTSE All Share Index. Tracker funds are becoming pseudo-natural resources funds. The performance of UK equity income funds has been dominated by how much the fund manager has dared to have in natural resources.\"</p> <p>It's an argument that has won Mott a significant backing from investors who have poured more than \u00a3400m into his Psigma fund over the past year. Critics point out Mott first started telling investors banks were cheap last September, since when most have halved in value despite a recent bounce.</p> <p>Britain's most successful \"value\" investor, Neil Woodford of Invesco Perpetual (who runs more than \u00a312bn in his Income and High Income funds), isn't impressed by the arguments for banks. He says: \"I do not feel impelled to dive into the bank sector at all because there is much more value on offer elsewhere in the market.\"</p> <p>Woodford believes we are at the start of a significant economic correction in the UK as we stumble through the aftermath of over-indebted consumers and a bloated housing market. For now he remains heavily invested in energy stocks such as BP and BG, with the best value to be found in health stocks such as GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca.</p> <p>At Jupiter, Philip Gibbs runs the \u00a3715m Financial Opportunities fund. But although he watches bank stocks constantly, he barely has a positive word to say about them.</p> <p>A famously contrarian investor, he accurately spotted the start of the credit crunch and today his fund remains 60% invested in ultra-safe cash-like instruments. Banks may look superficially attractive on traditional measures such as price/earnings ratios, but he is pessimistic whether those earnings will come through.</p> <p>The unwinding of the property bubble in Britain and America will continue to wreck profits, further hampered by the reluctance of central banks to reduce interest rates in the face of an inflationary threat.</p> <p>So where does this leave small investors? Mark Dampier of Hargreaves Lansdown, Britain's biggest fund advisers, says many are sensibly leaving much of their portfolios in cash.</p> <p>\"I don't disagree with the long-term view of Bill Mott, but what we are currently going through looks more like a blip than a new trend. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the big names in the City come back from holidays in September and we'll then see the market re-testing its former lows,\" he says.</p> <p>\"A lot of our clients are in cash, and you can understand that when bonds are paying a fantastic 7%.\" He expects the economy to slide through 2009 and even into 2010, but that the stockmarket will recover before then. The key, he says, is to place your money with fund managers who have significantly outperformed in good times and bad.</p> <p>\"You've just got to stick with the blokes who have been through this before, who are good solid stockpickers ... that means people like Invesco Perpetual's Woodford and Jupiter's Gibbs. Gibbs may be Dr Doom right now but history has shown how good he is at market timing and making money in bear markets.</p> <p>\"Trust these individuals rather than trying to take decisions yourself.\"</p>",
  "<h2>A domino trick</h2> <p><strong>Through mental ability, concentration and special powers, you can choose the exact domino needed to complete a circle!</strong></p> <p>Ask your volunteer to spread all the dominoes out on the floor, number side up. While they are doing this, ask lots of silly questions (\"Would you rather be a dog or an alien?\" is a good one!)</p> <p>Tell your volunteer you will now choose a domino based on what you have learned about them. Look hard at all the different pieces, pretending to think carefully about which one to choose (it doesn't actually doesn't matter which one you pick, as the trick will always work). Leave this domino to the side, but still in view.</p> <p>Ask your volunteer to lay out the dominoes in a circle, in the usual way (one dot touching one dot, six dots touching six dots, and double numbers turned sideways, etc). When it comes to completing the circle, it turns out that the piece you chose was exactly the piece they need.

  "<p>Our nearly-five-year old turns to me and says: \"Dad,when I'm big, will I be like you?\" Now \"big\", in my family, is a relative term. The chances of anyone descended from me exceeding 5ft7in in height are small, which allows me to respond to my son's question with the chuckle that parents use when they don't know the big answers. But behind my knowing smile, I'm rattled. Hmm, I think \u2014 I don't know, son. Will you be like me? Will you, too, wake up every morning with the uneasy feeling that you should have studied finance or law instead of psychology, but that it will all be all right if you can somehow just make it through to 7pm and fix yourself a drink? Is that the question? When I was five, my own father took me aside and told me there are three things a man must be able to do: swim a length without armbands, ride a bicycle without stabilisers and roll a cigarette in one hand while rounding-up cattle on horseback. (I'm pleased to report that my dad can do all three.) I remember nodding gravely, adopting an expression of seriousness appropriate to the moment. I felt I was being handed the keys to the kingdom; that I had been singled out to receive esoteric knowledge. My dad laughed and patted me on the back, and said we could just start with the bicycle if I liked.</p> <p>Thirty years on from that first man-to-man chat, I'm still wondering when I'm going to get the stabilisers off . My front crawl looks as if I learned it on a dude ranch in Wyoming, while my hand-rolled cigarettes seem to have been crafted in the deep end of the local pool. And here is my son asking me: \"Dad, when I'm big, will I be like you?\" (No, son, not if you're really lucky and you work very hard on your stroke.) Meanwhile, my own dad can sail across oceans, explain the biochemistry behind brewing the perfect pint of Guinness and ring a complete peal of changes on a set of eight church bells. The problem with fathers is that they are born one step ahead. You learn judo, but they have already moved onto snake-style kung fu. So you learn kung fu, but now they favour conflict resolution through dialogue. Finally, you learn diplomacy, but your old man just smiles and shows you how to disarm an opponent with a single well aimed Rizla, thrown at a gallop. It's nouse \u2014 the only thing my generation of men can do that our fathers can't is configure the internet access on Mum's computer. (This is how she can email us to say thanks for the technical support, son, and by the way, your father has been shortlisted for the Nobel prize for manliness.) My relative inadequacy would be much easier to explain if I could claim that my father was simply more genetically gifted. Unfortunately, the evidence against this is overwhelming. The old man and I are physically identical and my sons seem to be following suit. The male Cleaves are not so much a bloodline as a refutation of Mendel; a genetic anomaly of reproduction without variation.</p> <p>In my parents' attic, I find black-and-white photographs of myself astride a palomino, rolling perfect cigarettes against the pommel of my saddle. It isn't until I recall my inability to sit on a horse that I realise that the man with my face is my father. I find him looking like me in a biochemistry lab, resembling me in the church bell tower, reminding me of me at the helm of a boat in an Atlantic storm I never sailed through. He's been everywhere, done everything and kept his sense of humour. My dad is me with rodeo skills and a 28-year headstart. Having figured this out, I turn to my five-year-old and I say to him: \"I don't think you'll be like me. I think you'll be more like your grandad.\" And my son thinks about this for a moment and then nods gravely, as if he has been singled out for esoteric knowledge, as if he has been given the keys to the kingdom.</p>",
  "<h2>Northern exposure: Jennifer Davies</h2> <p>After 20 hours' travelling on three different planes, I was finally nearing my destination. From up in the air I searched for any sign of civilisation in the hundreds of miles of lakes and trees. I nearly missed Aklavik, which from the plane looked the size of my thumbnail.</p> <p>It was here in Aklavik, a remote village in the Canadian Arctic Circle, with its 350 inhabitants, one grocery store and the snowy, bitter-cold wilderness as the only distraction, that I first became interested in medicine.</p> <p>I had won a place on a gap-year programme to help out at the local school. The village of Aklavik is surrounded by breathtaking beauty, but is plagued by high levels of unemployment and by drug and alcohol abuse. As a teaching assistant, my job was to help out with everything from science to PE lessons, but in practice I found myself teaching. I also offered one-to-one tutoring for students with special needs. Many are suffering from the effects of foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), a big problem within the Inuit and Gwich'in community. Foetal alcohol syndrome is the name given to the physical and mental damage caused to babies when women drink during pregnancy. The high unemployment rate here leads many people to turn to alcohol and drugs, and their children are affected.</p> <p>I tutored one girl who had the condition quite severely. At 13, she had a reading age of just six. I worked with her on practical skills such as cookery, finance skills and sewing. She was amazing. It was rewarding to watch her grow, but sad to see how something that could be prevented continued to affect people throughout their lives.</p> <p>During that year I learned a lot about the community and their way of life, but also about myself. The town offered little entertainment, so we would read, play guitar and play board games. We went for walks. You only had to walk for five minutes and it felt like you were at the end of the world. The simple life is one of the best.</p> <p>Since I didnt have the right A-levels to apply for a medicine course, at the end of my gap year I applied to do a law degree. But something inside me knew it was the wrong move and I changed my mind. I went back home to Wales and spent a year doing a chemistry A-level, therefore opening the doors to a career in medicine.</p> <p>In Aklavik I learned to be more versatile and resilient. The small things dont bother me anymore because I know there are bigger problems. It's my dream to go back to Aklavik and work as a doctor.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jennifer Davies is from Tregaron, Ceredigion, and is just about to go into the second year of a degree in medicine at St George's, University of London</p> <h2>Our man in Iran: Christopher Dobbing</h2> <p>The gap year is essentially a 14-month break in the warm, fuzzy space between education and the real world. After the obligatory crummy jobs, and scrimping and saving for months, I'd got enough together for a 90-day round- the-world trip, including 10 days crossing Iran.</p> <p>I was travelling alone on the regular overland bus service between London and Sydney, Ozbus. The three-month journey crosses 18 countries and every imaginable terrain. For me, though, Iran was the appeal. I'm fascinated by the place. It's one of the cradles of civilisation. President Ahmadinejad has put the country at the centre of world politics, and I went to see what all the fuss is about.</p> <p>After leaving Turkey, the bus took us from Tabriz in the north-west to Bam in the south-east. I was overwhelmed by how different everything was from my expectations. Everywhere the streets are buzzing. Everyone seemed contented and cheerful, and those who spoke any English often came up for a chat. It gave the country a brilliant, friendly feel. My solitary wander through Irans third largest city, Isfahan, did not reveal any nuclear weapons factories or fundamentalist Muslims hunting for westerners to kidnap. I felt safe and welcomed.</p> <p>As I gazed at a shop window one day at a magnificent array of silver trinkets, I was approached by a young Iranian guy of about my age, who introduced himself as Ali. We chatted for a while. He playfully came out with a load of cockney rhyming slang he learned from some Brits who had passed through a couple of months before. Impressed, I ask what he did for a living. He pulled a face. \"If I tell you, you'll run away.\" I cautiously promised not to. Ali looked at me, grinned and declared: \"I'm a carpet seller.\" I burst into laughter, and so did he. He took me to his shop, gave me tea and we talked about the country. Not once did he mention buying a carpet. From my conversations with him I got the impression that politics was very detached from the streets, the upcoming elections were of little interest to Ali or any of his family or friends; they were disenfranchised.</p> <p>One day, Ali explained, he would like to go to Australia and start a business there, but he would never get a passport. To be granted permission to leave the country, Iranian citizens must do two years' national service, something that he refused to do. My British passport was burning a hole in my pocket at this point, and I felt guilty for my right to travel wherever the whim took me.</p> <p>The trip gave me a new respect for the freedoms afforded me, an appreciation of our multicultural and liberal way of life, and experience of doing my own laundry. I'd recommend a gap year to anyone.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Christopher Dobbing, from Sutton Courtenay, Oxfordshire, will be going to Pembroke College, Cambridge, in October, to read social and political sciences</p> <h2>Hong Kong fooey: Sonya Arratoon</h2> <p>It was our first Christmas away from our families in the Midlands and we were a month into a job at Mad Dogs Pub in Kowloon, Hong Kong. Hong Kong was the first stop on our round-the-world ticket. My friend Katie took the bar job and I worked the floor. We were 18.</p> <p>The themed basement English pub was just a stone's throw from the harbour front. It was adjacent to an alleyway that led to some small stalls selling naked figures and watches for tourists. We commuted daily from our 12th-floor flat in Kowloon Tong to the bustling pavements of Tsim Sha Tsui in Kowloon. The pub's opening night was a success and we soon felt part of the Kowloon scene living, working and socialising there.</p> <p>Mad Dogs was the sort of place where the owners had time to talk to the staff. In this case they were chatty Scots who already had a themed pub across the harbour on the island. They talked about shopping trips to England to choose the pictures, nostalgia and antiques decorating the walls.</p> <p>We served English breakfasts and fish and chips by day to a passing trade of hungry tourists from all over. By night we were a pub, with a cocktail menu. The food was prepared by a small team of Chinese cooks. The kitchen doubled as the locker/changing room, and wasnt much bigger than a London cab.</p> <p>The cooks were young and smiley and prepared their own food. One day I stood and grappled with my first cooked chicken claw in between serving customers. After work, socialising with the international staff was compulsory, and as the only 18-year olds in the group, we were taken under their wing.</p> <p>One night, a few days before Christmas, there was an almighty scene in the middle of the usual busy evening service. Half a dozen Chinese faces stormed noisily down the steps across the floor shouting in Chinese. Some hurled and scattered chairs and tables. One made for the middle of the long wooden bar with a meat cleaver. Customers screamed and backed up against the walls. It was pure shock and panic . The cleaver landed in the wooden bar, but there only seemed to be seconds between the arrival of the gang, the realisation there wasnt an exit and the arrival of the uniformed police. The rest was a blur. The next day we got the explanation: we had been raided by the triads as the owners hadnt paid protection money for their new business. The triads had wanted to make their presence felt.</p> <p>Looking back on the whole gap year, I think it was an exciting life experience, full of firsts and adventure. Hong Kong was the perfect first stop on the journey as it was a great sensory overload. It also gave me a bug to travel in Asia.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Sonya Arratoon is from London and teaches English as a second language in a further education college</p> <h2>In a pickle in Italy: Duncan Robinson</h2> <p>In Rome, after three weeks of navigating Italy by myself perfectly have a break and a Coke at a cafe, I went to get some cash out of an ATM. I punched in my pin code. Once. Twice. Something, I should have realised, was amiss. Instead, I put the code in again. With a horrifying bleep, my card was sucked into the machine.</p> <p>I looked in my wallet. I had approximately two euros in change. I had no back-up credit card; no travellers' cheques. All I had was 20 in sterling, for some reason left in my rucksack.</p> <p>I tried to explain the situation to a bank manager. It was 3pm and he was knocking off for the day. \"Domani! Domani!\" he said. Fortunately, my youth hostel in Rome had already been paid for. So had my next one ... but it was in Naples, and somehow I had to get there.</p> <p>I exchanged my 20. My fare to Naples obliterated this. That night, I scrounged some sandwiches off some Australians in my hostel.</p> <p>In Naples the next day, a helpful hostel owner allowed me to stay without paying up front. I asked him where I could find a Moneygram service so I could get some cash my parents had agreed to send. \"Che?\"</p> <p>I strolled into the city and started asking strangers: \"Dove il Moneygram?\" After six hours of walking, I found a post office that offered Moneygram transfers on the other side of the city.</p> <p>The money, however, had not arrived. \"Domani! Domani!\" cried the cashier. I didnt have enough money for the metro, and so I walked for two hours back to the hostel.</p> <p>With the bit of change I had, I managed to buy some pasta, but couldnt stretch to anything to go with it. In the hostel kitchen I found some olive oil. I gave my noodles a liberal dousing, only then to discover I had misread the bottle. It was white wine vinegar.</p> <p>I returned to the post office the next day and got my money. All that was left was to walk through Italy's notoriously crime-infested city with \u20ac500 in my pocket. I was practically skipping.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Duncan Robinson, from Northallerton, north Yorkshire, is going into his second year studying history at the University of Sheffield competently, something went wrong.

  "<p>Pity Georgia's bedraggled first infantry brigade. And its second. And its hapless navy.</p> <p>For the past few evenings in the foothills of the Southern Caucasus on the outskirts of Joseph Stalin's hometown of Gori, reconnaissance units of Russia's 58th army have been raking through the spoils of war at what was the Georgian army's pride and joy, a shiny new military base inaugurated only last January for the first infantry, the army engineers, and an artillery brigade.</p> <p>A couple of hours to the west, in the town of Senaki, it's the same picture. A flagship military base, home to the second infantry brigade, is in Russian hands. And down on the Black Sea coast, the radars and installations for Georgia's sole naval base at Poti have been scrupulously pinpointed by the Russians and destroyed.</p> <p>Gori and Senaki are not ramshackle relics of the old Red Army of the type that litter the landscape of eastern Europe. \"These bases have only recently been upgraded to Nato standard,\" said Matthew Clements, Eurasia analyst at Jane's Information Group. \"They have been operationally targeted to seriously degrade the Georgian military.\"</p> <p>\"There is a presence of our armed forces near Gori and Senaki. We make no secret of it,\" said the general staff in Moscow. \"They are there to defuse an enormous arsenal of weapons and military hardware which have been discovered in the vicinity of Gori and Senaki without any guard whatsoever.\"</p> <p>The \"enormous arsenals\" are American-made or American-supplied. American money, know-how, planning, and equipment built these bases as part of Washington's drive to bring Nato membership to a small country that is Russia's underbelly.</p> <p>The American \"train and equip\" mission for the Georgian military is six years old. It has been destroyed in as many days. And with it, Georgia's Nato ambitions. \"There are a few countries that will say 'told you so'\" about the need to get Georgia into Nato,\" said Andrew Wilson, Russia expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \"But many more will want to walk away from the problem. And for the next few years, Georgia will be far too busy trying to pick itself up.\"</p> <p>If Georgia and Nato are the principal casualties of this week's ruthless display of brute power by Vladimir Putin, the consequences are bigger still, the fallout immense, if uncertain. The regional and the global balance of power looks to have tilted, against the west and in favour of the rising or resurgent players of the east.</p> <p>In a seminal speech in Munich last year, Putin confidently warned the west that he would not tolerate the age of American hyperpower. Seven years in office at the time and at the height of his powers, he delivered his most anti-western tirade </p> <p><strong>Pernicious</strong></p> <p>To an audience that included John McCain, the White House contender, and Robert Gates, the US defence secretary and ex-Kremlinologist, he served notice: \"What is a unipolar world? It refers to one type of situation, one centre of authority, one centre of force, one centre of decision-making. It is world in which there is one master, one sovereign. This is pernicious ... unacceptable ... impossible.\"</p> <p>This week, he turned those words into action, demonstrating the limits of US power with his rout of Georgia. His forces roamed at will along the roads of the Southern Caucasus, beyond Russia's borders for the first time since the disastrous Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s.</p> <p>As the Russian officers sat on the American stockpiles of machine guns, ammunition, and equipment in Gori, they were savouring a highly unusual scenario. Not since the Afghan war had the Russians seized vast caches of US weaponry. \"People are sick to the stomach in Washington,\" said a former Pentagon official. And the Russians are giddy with success.</p> <p>Celebrating the biggest victory in eight years of what might be termed Putinism, the dogged pursuit by whatever means to avenge a long period of Russian humiliation and to deploy his limited range of levers - oil, gas, or brute force - to make the world listen to Moscow, the Russian prime minister has redrawn the geopolitical map.</p> <p>In less than a week, Putin has invaded another country, effectively partitioned Georgia in a lightning campaign, weakened his arch-enemy, President Mikheil Saakashvili, divided the west, and presented a fait accompli. The impact - locally, regionally, and globally - is huge.</p> <p>\"The war in Georgia has put the European order in question,\" said Alexander Rahr, one of Germany's leading Russia experts and a Putin biographer. \"The times are past when you can punish Russia.\"</p> <p>That seems to be the view among leading European policymakers who have been scrambling all week to arrange and shore up a fragile ceasefire, risking charges of appeasing the Kremlin.</p> <p>\"Don't ask us who's good and who's bad here,\" said Bernard Kouchner, the French foreign minister, after shuttling between Tbilisi and Moscow to try to halt the violence. \"We shouldn't make any moral judgments on this war. Stopping the war, that's what we're interested in.\"</p> <p>His boss, President Nicolas Sarkozy, went to the Kremlin to negotiate a ceasefire and parade as a peacemaker. Critics said he acted as Moscow's messenger, noting Putin's terms then taking them to Tbilisi to persuade </p> <p>Saakashvili to capitulate. Germany also refused to take sides while Italy warned against building an \"anti-Moscow coalition\".</p> <p>That contrasted with Gordon Brown's and David Milliband's talk of Russian \"aggression\" and Condoleezza Rice's arrival in Tbilisi yesterday to rally \"the free world behind a free Georgia\".</p> <p>The effects of Putin's coup are first felt locally and around Russia's rim. \"My view is that the Russians, and I would say principally prime minister Putin, is interested in reasserting Russia's, not only Russia's great power or superpower status, but in reasserting Russia's traditional spheres of influence,\" said Gates. \"My guess is that everyone is going to be looking at Russia through a different set of lenses as we look ahead.\" </p> <p>In Kiev certainly. Ukraine's pro-western prime minister, Viktor Yushchenko, Saaksahvili's fellow colour-revolutionary, is chastened and wary. His firebrand anti-Russian prime minister, Yuliya Tymoshenko, has gone uncharacteristically quiet.</p> <p><strong>Invasion</strong></p> <p>\"An invasion of Ukraine by 'peacekeeping tanks' is just a question of time,\" wrote Aleksandr Sushko, director of Kiev's Institute of Euro-Atlantic Cooperation. \"Weimar Russia is completing its transformation into something else. If Russia wins this war, a new order will take shape in Europe which will have no place for Ukraine as a sovereign state.\"</p> <p>All around Russia's rim, the former Soviet \"captive states\" are trembling. Even Belarus, the slavishly loyal \"last dictatorship in Europe\", went strangely silent, taking days before the regime offered Moscow its support. \"Everybody's nervous,\" said Wilson.</p> <p>The EU states of the Baltic and Poland are drumming up support for Georgia, with the Polish president Lech Kaczynski declaring that Russia has revealed \"its true face\". That divides the EU since the French and the Germans refuse to take sides and are scornful of east European \"hysteria\" towards Russia. Rahr in Berlin says the German and French governments are striving to keep the Poles and the Baltic states well away from any EU-led peace negotiations. It was the Germans and the French who, in April, blunted George Bush's drive to get Georgia into Nato. They will also resist potential US moves to kick Russia out of the G8 or other international bodies.</p> <p>There are many who argue that Putin's gamble will backfire, that he has bitten off more than he can chew, that Russia remains weak, a \"Saudi Arabia with trees\" in the words of Robert Hunter, the former US ambassador to Nato.</p> <p>Compared to the other rising powers of China, India or even Brazil - the companions referred to as the BRIC - Russia does indeed appear weak. Its economy struggles to develop goods or services, depends on raw material exports and on European consumption and the price of oil for its current wealth.</p> <p><strong>Resources</strong></p> <p>But Putin's talent is for playing a weak hand well, maximising and concentrating his limited resources, and creating facts on the ground while the west dithers.</p> <p>\"There is a lack of a clear and unified European policy towards Russia,\" said Clements. In the crucial contest over energy \"the Russian strategy of keeping control of exports and supply is outpacing any European response\".</p> <p>Putin may now calculate he can call off the dogs of war, having achieved his aims and able to pocket his gains very cheaply. The Georgia campaign becomes the triumphant climax of Putinism.</p> <p>\"In politics, it is very important to know one's measure,\" wrote Aleksey Arbatov, director of Moscow's International Security Centre. \"If Russia continues to inflict strikes on Georgian territory, on facilities, on population centres, we may lose the moral supremacy we have today.\"</p> <p>But Wilson and many in eastern Europe worry that rather than being the climax of Putinism, the Russians in Georgia signal the start of something else. \"This may not be a culmination, but only step one,\" said Wilson. \"If you don't stop this kind of behaviour, it escalates.\"</p>",
  "<p>With his New York legalese, motormouth soundbites and ubiquity on the American networks, Mikheil Saakashvili is never lost for words. The beleaguered Georgian president is so omnipresent on Larry King, on BBC World, in tele-conferences for reporters, editors, and columnists worldwide, that is hard to see where he finds the time to fight a war or run a country.</p> <p>But the week-old Russia-Georgia conflict highlights the mores and methods of modern warfare. Propaganda and black radio have always been essential tools of the warmonger. What's new in the Caucasus is the battle between the PR agencies taking the warmongers' shilling and competing for airtime and column inches on behalf of their clients.</p> <p>Saakashvili might have lost the war against Russia, but, scant consolation perhaps, he is widely seen to have won the propaganda battle. Big bad Russia against plucky little Georgia. Accurate or nonsense, thanks to \"Misha's\" Brussels-based PR men, it is the picture that's dominating the world media.</p> <p>Last year Saakashvili paid a reported \u20ac500,000 to engage Brussels' Aspect Consulting to brand Georgia as a western wannabe, a Nato and European Union aspirant, emphasising everything from its fabulous food and drink to its liberties and democratic politics.</p> <p>The PR campaign went into overdrive last week when Georgia found itself on the receiving end of post-Soviet Russia's first ever invasion of another country. Reporters covering the conflict have been showered daily with emails providing news, contact details, mobile phone numbers of officials, video footage, background material, and tele-conference access to Georgians from Saakashvili down. Highly efficient, highly effective, usually punctual.</p> <p>The Kremlin's account is held by another Brussels agency, GPlus, which has been working for the Russian presidency for more than two years. It insists it is not in the business of peddling propaganda, far less falsehoods, but merely facilitates international media access to Russian policy-makers and advises the Russians on their media strategies. \"We give them logistical support,\" said Tim Price of GPlus.</p> <p>Even the Russians are complaining that their side is losing in the publicity stakes. \"You can't fail to notice that Russian leaders are ignoring the opportunity to convey their point of view to the world,\" wrote the Moscow pundit, Aleksei Arbatov. \"Saakashvili is really never off American TV screens. I suspect that if [Russian president] Medvedev decided to talk to foreign journalists, they would, of course, respond.\"</p> <p>The success of the Georgia PR campaign has made it to the cover this week of the trade magazine PR Week, where Aspect is taking the war to the opposition. \"I'm on the side of the angels,\" Aspect's founding partner, James Hunt, told the magazine. He held his nose at the thought of GPlus.</p> <p>\"There are agencies that work for Russia. But I don't know how they can be comfortable about that.\"</p>",
  "<p>Merrill Lynch could avoid paying tax in the UK for decades thanks to $29bn (\u00a316bn) of losses made on its toxic investments through its London subsidiary.</p> <p>The impact on the Treasury's coffers is the latest illustration of the impact the credit crunch is having on the wider economy and has led to concerns about the reduction in tax receipts on the government's fragile finances.</p> <p>Banks are a crucial contributor to the public finances. National Audit Office data for the 2005-06 financial year - the most recent available - show that banks were the biggest payers of corporation tax, at \u00a37bn. Contributors included the high street banks and UK operations of Wall Street firms now hit by the credit crunch.</p> <p>The impact of shrinking bank profits on tax receipts may become apparent in the pre-budget report this autumn when the Treasury publishes estimates of the public finances.</p> <p>Bill Dodwell, head of tax policy at accountants Deliotte, said: \"The good news is they have been collecting more corporation tax from the oil sector, but who knows if that is going to compensate for the losses by the banks?\"</p> <p>In the first half of the year, the profits of the high street banks listed in London were down \u00a314bn on the same period in 2007, which will affect their tax bills, set at the end of the financial year. For the first six months of last year the banks expected to pay taxes of more than \u00a35bn, but their latest figures indicate that will be \u00a31bn. </p> <p>Under UK law, a loss can be carried forward indefinitely until the company has made as much in profit as it has losses. According to accounts filed at Companies House this month, Merrill Lynch made \u00a37.4bn of losses in the year to end-December, compared with a profit of \u00a3393m the previous year. </p> <p>After the financial year end, the accounts show the firm recorded exceptional write-downs of \u00a35.5bn related to investments that have turned toxic in the credit crunch, taking the total loss to almost \u00a313bn. Further losses are revealed in a US regulatory filing, taking the total loss to \u00a316bn. Merrill could record further losses on the collateralised debt obligations - complex instruments at the core of its losses - which will also be booked through London.</p> <p>Merrill Lynch yesterday took steps to attempt to return to profitability by announcing a hiring freeze. In a memo from New York head office signed by Gregory Fleming, president and chief operating officer, and Thomas Sanzone, chief administrative officer, the bank said only financial advisers were immune from the ruling on headcount.</p> <p>\"A global hiring freeze will be in place for the remainder of the year. This freeze covers any incremental hires including previously approved budgeted hires and replacement hires. This policy does not apply to financial advisers or client associates who the firm will continue to recruit and hire in line with business plans.</p> <p>\"Typically, the majority of the firm's hiring occurs during the first and second quarters of the year with the third and fourth quarters progressively tapering off,\" the memo said.</p>",

  "<p>Gap years advertised in glossy brochures are now so passe, it seems. These days a growing number of students are deciding they want to do something more useful with their time out than sleeping on the beach in Goa. They might volunteer for a charity, or use the year to turn an idea into a business venture, or simply get work experience that will dress up their CV and benefit their own long-term future. But a growing number of people go even further: they want an adventure without the selfish, carefree connotations of backpacking. So they set up their own charity adventure. </p> <p>Going it alone adds a bit of unpredictability. Becoming a \"chad\" - or charity adventurer - means inventing your own trip and raising money for your favourite cause. Chads devise their own trip or challenge and then set about attracting publicity. Tom Griffiths, founder of <a href=\"http://www.gapyear.com\">gapyear.com</a>, says chads are \"modern-day adventurers who take on exciting and often dangerous trips for the benefit of others\". In fact, you've probably had an email from a chad asking you to donate to a trip that has made you want to leave the office and board a plane pronto. With the internet, it's now easier than ever to tell thousands about what you are doing and, with sites like <a href=\"http://www.justgiving.com\">justgiving.com</a>, it's simple to collect the money, too. Should you give it a go?</p> <p>\"You'll stand out from the other graduates. If you organised your own trip, advertised what you were doing and thought up something really different, you are bound to impress employers,\" Griffiths says. Charity adventures are the last bastion of raw travel adventure, he adds.</p> <h2>Steve Fabes: spent a year cycling in Chile</h2> <p>Steve Fabes left for a gap year cycling from Punta Arenas in southern Chile to Arica, Chile's northernmost city, with his brother, Ronan, in 2000. Fabes, then 19, and Ronan, then 17, planned the five month trip on their own.</p> <p>\"The idea was appealing because the country crosses so many different terrains. There's Patagonia in the south, then the middle is Mediterranean in climate and the north is dry. We literally got a map and pointed, and said: 'We'll go from there to there',\" he says. </p> <p>\"We were a bit naive when we started out. We had to take the pedals off our bikes to get them on the plane and we put them back on wrongly and had to find someone to sort our bikes out as soon as we got there. We were very confident travellers by the end, though.\" </p> <p>At the start of their trip, they would cycle for days without seeing other vehicles. \"We realised that our bikes were ill equipped for the terrain, although they were new. Then the Patagonian wind whipped everything off the bikes, so we'd be chasing around for our sleeping bags and tents.\" Central Chile was easier. The pair were fitter by then and used to cycling 100km to 120km a day. They biked past vineyards.<br> \"We would meet quite a few long distance cyclists on our route, which was fun. One of the main things we got to appreciate was how fantastic it was to cycle everywhere. You get invited to sleep in people's homes, in churches and in schools. It was the best way to see somewhere and it was cheap.\" </p> <p>The pair raised \u00a37,000 for cystic fibrosis on their trip. \"It cost us less than \u00a32,000 together in flights, bikes and living costs,\" says Fabes. </p> <p>\"We got great satisfaction from planning the adventure ourselves. But I made sure I spoke to plenty of experts. We asked long-distance cyclists, one of whom literally turned up on my doorstep, to tell me his tips. I emailed people I found who had done similar things.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Steve Fabes is a doctor in London, having graduated from Liverpool University's medical school </p> <h2>Richard Offland: worked with injured wildlife in South Africa</h2> <p>Richard Offland knew he wanted a gap year in South Africa working with animals. But the 18-year-old from Cheshire wasn't going to go with an organised group; he'd sort it out himself.</p> <p>He came across the Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds in Cape Town on an internet search last year, after his A-levels. </p> <p>It looked just the ticket. He'd be helping injured penguins until they were healthy enough to go back into the ocean.</p> <p>Offland phoned the charity and arranged his accommodation nearby. He then set about fundraising. He was being sponsored by Worldwide Volunteering and had to pay \u00a3900 to volunteer at the conservation centre for eight weeks.</p> <p>He held car boot sales, put up a display in his local supermarket and sold Easter eggs at school that he'd bought at a discount at a cash and carry. And it was all worth it.</p> <p>\"It was a tremendous experience,\" he says. \"The penguins moult like dogs and it was breeding season, so all the chicks were hatching. The penguins couldn't go into the sea while they moulted so they couldn't get food to feed their chicks. We rescued hundreds of chicks and gave them a health check.</p> <p>\"We'd force-feed the injured penguins. One, Stumpy, had stitches on his belly because he had been attacked by a seal. We'd often get in birds that were so ill, they had lost weight. We would chop up a formula of catfood, fish and vitamins and tube it into them. We disinfected the penguins' pool and their dry area.</p> <p>\"We were invited to release the birds back into the sea when they had been rehabilitated.</p> <p>Offland was the youngest of the volunteers, and loved working with graduates and postgraduates. </p> <p>\"I went on my own and met people out there. I wanted to organise my gap-year adventure myself. Inventing your own itinerary and planning your year yourself gives you a sense of independence. It was also a lot cheaper that way.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Richard Offland is going to Aberdeen University next month to study zoology </p> <h2>Rob Gauntlett and James Hooper: serial fundraisers</h2> <p>When school friends Rob Gauntlett and James Hooper finished their A-levels three years ago, they went on a seven-week, 3,000-mile cycle from Bilbao to Istanbul. It was their first adventure to raise money for Cancer Research UK and the Prince's Trust, which helps disadvantaged young people. And, although challenging by most people's standards, it was a walk in the park compared to what the pair would later do.</p> <p>Their next mission was to climb Ama Dablam, a mountain in the Himalayan range of eastern Nepal, which is 6,812m high at its main peak. They were hungry for more, and returned to their homes in Sussex and Somerset determined to climb Everest.</p> <p>After fundraising for four months and training in Scotland and the Alps, they set off. The pair, then aged 19, reached the summit from the north side - 8,848m - in May and raised \u00a325,000. \"We had lost three stone each and it took about five to six weeks to recover,\" says Gauntlett. \"Above 8,000m, your body starts to break down and the cells don't replace themselves. I looked like an eight-year-old.\" </p> <p>Instead of feeling elated, they felt low. \"We had a focal point and then it was all over, leaving us feeling awful,\" he says. \"We had to plan something else.\" This would not mean just another charity adventure, it would mean another gap year at least, because to organise their adventure would take at least 18 months. </p> <p>They were going to cycle, ski and sail from the north pole to the south pole. In under a year, they had done it. But only just. At one point Gauntlett fell through ice in Greenland and nearly died. He had dropped his glove and gone back to pick it up. The ice was thin and he fell face-down into -2C water, where he was stuck for a few minutes. He remained unconscious for four hours. Had Hooper not wrapped him in protective clothing and called for an emergency helicopter on the satellite phone, Gauntlett would have died.</p> <p>Once they had recovered, the pair insisted on continuing their trip, against the wishes of friends, family and sponsors. They completed it and collected tens of thousands of pounds from sponsors. Now Gauntlett has a place to study geography at Edinburgh University and Hooper has one to study archaeology at Sheffield University. But after their adventures, the 21-year-olds are not sure they are going to take them up.</p> <p>They are writing a book about their expedition from pole to pole. They give talks at schools on climate change, having seen it first-hand, and in Gauntlett's case, from frighteningly close quarters. \"Years ago, I wouldn't have fallen through the ice because it wouldn't have been so thin,\" he says. They also give talks encouraging pupils to aim high and fulfil their dreams.</p> <h2>How to set up your own charity challenge</h2> <p><strong>Use the web</strong><br>You can read about thousands of other people's trips online, but also, you can build your own website, making it easy for sponsors to donate. Gapyear.com founder Tom Griffiths suggests \"gappers\" invent a name that is short and encapsulates their adventure, such as \"Cycle Chile\". Make that your website address, and put a photo of you doing the activity you are trying to raise money for on the home page. </p> <p><strong>Sort the fundraising</strong><br>Griffiths also advises joining <a href=\"http://www.justgiving.com\">justgiving.com</a>, which looks after thousands of fundraising pages. If you have a personal interest in the charity you are raising money for, write about it on the site. He suggests choosing a local charity. \"You might be more likely to get sponsorship and you might get local press coverage.\" </p> <p>Be prepared to face rejection if you seek sponsorship from big firms, says Steve Fabes. He thinks it is probably better to ask friends and family. \"The big corporates get approached by so many people. I sent 150 letters and I got two hits,\" he says. Think of a nice big PR stunt, too, like sitting in a bath of cat food. \"Don't be deterred by people's cynicism,\" says Fabes. \"I had to work hard to convince people I was passionate about the charity; they thought I just wanted to do the trip and should pay for it myself.\" </p> <p><strong>Safety first</strong><br>Most important is your safety. Griffiths recommends the Expedition Advisory Centre. The Foreign Office site, <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk\">fco.gov.uk</a>, is a must to check that your route is safe, while the Lonely Planet's website is useful for reading up on the cultural mores. It's a good idea to learn first aid and to enrol on a safety course with objectivegapyear.com. Make sure you have insurance, that you have had your jabs and have malaria medication. </p> <p><strong>Be prepared</strong><br>Don't be too ambitious, advises Griffiths. It's great to challenge yourself, but don't go overboard. \"It's the quirky element that is important.\" Last, immerse yourself in books about adventures to get you fired up: something by Sir Ranulph Fiennes or Alastair Humphreys should do the trick.</p>",
  "<p>In a Greenwich Village bookstore, a window is filled with a poster that replays a familiar image. A boy and girl are walking down a snow-covered street, arm in arm, lost in some private paradise. He is hunched against the cold. Their heads are together. She is laughing. The photograph was taken 45 years ago, a stone's throw from where the shop stands. It went around the world, touching countless young lives. And now it has come back home.</p> <p>Bob Dylan and Suze Rotolo had been together for 18 months when the photographer Don Hunstein captured them for the cover of The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan. This album, Dylan's second, was the one that lifted him out of the tight little folk scene and broadcast his talent to a generation of eager young listeners. It was the one with \"Blowin' in the Wind\", \"Masters of War\", \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\" and \"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\", songs of social conscience, political awareness and a precocious sensitivity to the nuances and contradictions of love. The cover image, its intimacy and informality so far removed from the airbrushed self-presentation of most performers, was the perfect calling card.</p> <p>Sitting in a cafe in New York's East Village, where she now lives, Rotolo laughs at the pitfalls of memory. She and the photographer, she says, recently disagreed on exactly where they were on that cold February day in 1963. A few shots had been taken in the West 4th Street apartment she shared with Dylan. Then they all went outside, into the snow. Dylan, conscious of being in the process of creating an image for himself, pulled on a thin suede jerkin and shivered. Rotolo chose a thick sweater and a favourite loden-green winter coat, more suited to the conditions. Wrapped around each other, they walked through the slush towards the camera. Hunstein says they were on Cornelia Street. Rotolo is convinced it was Jones Street, one block closer to the apartment. \"So that's just going to have to remain a mystery for all those Dylanologists,\" she says, with a note of mischievous delight.</p> <p>Other mysteries are laid bare, and a few quietly preserved, in her new book, A Freewheelin' Time, subtitled A Memoir of Greenwich Village in the Sixties. Of all the unwritten books on Dylan, the most thoroughly documented musician of his era, this is perhaps the one most desired by his fans. As he has readily acknowledged, Rotolo played a vital role in his evolution; she was also the inspiration, or so it has always been assumed, for many of his most important early songs. Now a slender, elegant 64-year-old artist, she talks of finally overcoming her lifelong shyness and discretion to give us her commentary on that remarkable time.</p> <p>For many years she kept up her defences against those anxious for revelations about her former boyfriend, but an interview she contributed to No Direction Home, Martin Scorsese's much-praised biographical film on Dylan, helped her to overcome the fear, in a phrase she frequently employs, of \"feeding the beast\". She liked the way the film depicted the broader context: the people, the places, the politics. The first volume of Chronicles, Dylan's own autobiography, was another turn of the key that unlocked her memories. Then she met a Random House editor who suggested that she might write a book along the lines of Joyce Johnson's Minor Characters, an evocation of the author's life as Jack Kerouac's girlfriend in an earlier New York bohemia. It happened to be among Rotolo's favourites.</p> <p>\"My reflex action was to say, 'Thank you very much, but no.' It had been so many years that I'd shut the door. But the way he presented it was, what was it like as a young girl to come from the family I came from and end up in the Village and be in this place and observe it through my own eyes? That was something to think about. Then my son said, 'People have been writing a version of you for years. It's time you told the real one.' It suddenly made sense.\"</p> <p>The book is full of quick, deft sketches of key characters and others more peripheral. There is space for stories that have little or nothing to do with Dylan, such as Rotolo's extraordinary trip to Cuba with a group of students in 1964, breaking the US travel embargo and incurring the government's wrath. Inevitably, however, the narrative is driven by the story of their love affair, from its beginning in 1961 to its end three years later.</p> <p>She first saw him performing in a Village club in the spring of 1961. At the time she was working for Core, the Congress of Racial Equality, and already had many friends within the interlinked scenes of folk music and the civil rights movement. They came face to face a few weeks later, during an all-day session broadcast live from the Riverside Church, high up on the West Side, to raise funds for a radio station. Dylan took the stage mid-afternoon and drew laughter - much of it from women, as a bootleg recording attests - for his protracted comic fumblings with a recalcitrant harmonica holder.</p> <p>\"When he started out as a performer he was playful, a combination of Woody Guthrie and Harpo Marx, with a good dose of himself as a binding ingredient,\" Rotolo remembers. \"He used that playfulness to draw the audience in. With the passing of time, the technique was no longer required. The audience was with him the minute he stepped on stage. A sense of humour, however, was always his strong suit.\"</p> <p>Later that night they went on to a party together. \"Right from the start I couldn't take my eyes off her,\" Dylan wrote in Chronicles. \"She was the most erotic thing I'd ever seen. She was fair skinned and golden haired, full-blood Italian . . . We started talking and my head started to spin . . . She was just my type.\"</p> <p>She was also only 17, to his 21. She had already left the family home, but subterfuges were necessary until she turned 18 that November and they could legally live together in the two-room flat he had found for $60 a month on the top floor of 161 West 4th Street. It was only then, when they returned home after a night's drinking and his wallet fell out of his pocket, that she saw his draft card and discovered that his real name was not Dylan but Zimmerman: an early warning of his penchant for self-mythologising.</p> <p>She took him to art galleries, and introduced him to her favourite poets and playwrights. Through her he discovered Picasso and C\u00e9zanne, the French symbolist poets (\"Situations have ended sad / Relationships have all been bad / Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud,\" he wrote years later), Brecht and the politics of dissent, all of which he could stir together with the cultural influences he had brought with him from Minnesota - Kerouac, Guthrie, Robert Johnson. He looked on as she sketched constantly, and picked up the habit.</p> <p>Her parents, the children of Italian immigrants, were active communists with a strong artistic bent. \"I was always an artist,\" she says. \"I came from a family where art was important.\" Her father supplied occasional illustrations to the New York Times, but preferred to pursue a vocation as a union organiser until his death from a heart attack when Suze was 14. Her mother worked for a communist newspaper; her older sister, Carla, was an assistant to Alan Lomax, the celebrated musicologist.</p> <p>At that stage Dylan didn't even have a recording contract, and her book describes the mounting exhilaration as he took his first steps to fame. In the summer of 1962, however, she decided to accept an invitation from her mother and her new stepfather to accompany them on a trip to Europe, and to revive an earlier plan for her to study art in Perugia. Her friends were divided. Dylan said it was up to her, but he'd much rather she stayed. He waved from the docks as her ship pulled out, before going back to the apartment to write the first of many airmail letters. \"Everybody is waiting for the cooler weather,\" he wrote after she had settled into her student existence, \"and I am just waiting for you.\"</p> <p>While in Umbria she read Fran\u00e7oise Gilot's Life with Picasso and felt a shock of recognition. \"I felt I was reading a book of revelations, lessons, warnings,\" she writes. \"Even though Picasso was a much older man than Bob and had experienced a lot more, their personalities were so similar that it was astounding.\" Her doubts about living in the shadow of such a man contributed to her decision to extend her stay from four to six months; on her return, she discovered that she had incurred the disapproval of Dylan's inner circle for leaving him so bereft.</p> <p>Nevertheless, they resumed their relationship, and she moved back into the apartment while working at a variety of jobs that included designing folk-club posters, working for small theatre companies and waitressing. She invited him to a rehearsal of George Tabori's Brecht on Brecht at the Sheridan Square Playhouse, and in one of the most vivid passages of Chronicles he describes how hearing the performance of Kurt Weill's \"Pirate Jenny\" provoked a fundamental change in his approach to songwriting. Rotolo, too, remembers the moment. \"He sat still and quiet. Didn't even jiggle his leg.\"</p> <p>Nowadays she doesn't care to listen to the songs of parting and loss he wrote while she was away - \"Don't Think Twice\", \"One Too Many Mornings\", \"Tomorrow is a Long Time\" - even though, like their composer, she firmly resists literal interpretations. \"People ask, 'Was this song written for you?' Well, I could say this and that. I could make a list. But if you really listen to those songs, they're somewhat like fiction - he's written something coming from his life, but he sets it in a fiction, maybe using another character's voice. </p> <p>\"I can recognise things. It's like looking at a diary. It brings it all back. And what's hard is that you remember being unsure of how life was going to go - his, mine, anybody's. So, from the perspective of an older person looking back, you enjoy them, but also think of them as the pain of youth, the loneliness and the struggle that youth is, or may be.\"</p> <p>There was certainly plenty of pain. She describes the strains imposed by her mother's and sister's dislike of Dylan, by his gathering celebrity and by her need to assert the right to an independent existence. Her background made it easy for her to cope with his creative needs (\"I could see that he was an artist at work\"), but in those days there was little vocabulary to cope with the world's insistence that the girlfriend should sit quietly in the background.</p> <p>\"I was a young girl of my time. I was shy and timid, and I would be envious of men who could go to a cafe and sit and draw and read or write songs or do whatever they could do. If a girl did that it would mean that she was alone, she wasn't with somebody, she was an easy woman. It would take a lot of courage to do it, and when you did it, you took a chance.\"</p> <p>In one of her book's many memorable phrases, she describes Dylan as \"a beacon and a black hole\". \"He had this intensity about him, and you got sucked in,\" she says. \"I certainly felt that, as his girlfriend, I disappeared and became a nonentity. Even if he didn't see me that way, that's what happened. That was always a struggle.</p> <p>\"There are people who say that he was not a good guy - he was manipulative, he was this, that and the other. I tend to see it as, you are what you are. He could be a shit, like anybody else. But a lot of it had to do with being given permission to say and do whatever you wanted, because nobody was in a position to tell you no. Everybody's yessing you, and everybody wants a piece of you. So what do you do?\"</p> <p>A particularly large piece was claimed by Joan Baez, who arrived on the Dylan scene in the summer of 1963. Already a star, she performed his songs and began inviting him on stage to sing with her. He stayed at her home in California and soon the rumours got back to New York. When Baez joined Dylan on his own tour, however, she found him unwilling to return the favour. They had served each other's purposes, but the casualty was Rotolo.</p> <p>\"It's a very long time ago,\" she says, \"and there are no residual hurt feelings. I think she's an example of a woman who really knew what she wanted and how to get it, and to everybody else, the hell with you. Which men could do easily. She went out and got what she wanted, and then he in turn did it for her and then he didn't. That was him going after what he wanted, with no baggage. He never looked back. He just kept going.\"</p> <p>The book's unvarnished description of their slow break-up - \"He avoided responsibility . . . I was difficult and unreasonable\" - makes a poignant contrast with the famous image of the carefree lovers. A climactic row was followed by the discovery of her pregnancy, an illegal abortion, a brief reunion and her breakdown. \"It was the hardest thing to write about. I was young and vulnerable and insecure. There were pressures from all around and I couldn't find my place any more. I didn't feel I had anybody I could turn to. That makes you really fall apart. And that's how I felt.\"</p> <p>She escaped to Italy for a while, and in 1970 married Enzo Bartoliocci, whom she had met during her student days in Perugia. Now her husband is a film editor at the UN; their son, Luca, was born 28 years ago and is a luthier: \"Only four people in New York know what that means. He makes guitars.\" </p> <p>Inevitably, after such a hurtful parting, she and Dylan lost contact for a while. But when many of her possessions - including the loden-green coat and his old Gibson guitar - were lost in a fire in her apartment a few years later, he helped her out. In occasional touch, they remain respectful of each other and of their shared history. When she describes the episodic, overlapping structure of her book, and the effort to recall long-spent emotions, she could almost be him, talking about a song. \"It isn't factual,\" she says, \"but it's true. So it doesn't go from page to page. But the emotion that I managed to find is true.\"</p>",
  "<p>'Can you just hold the pose?\" grins the photographer. \"Sorry, I'm used to trying to make normal people look good.\" And it's true. From the moment Tuuli Shipster stepped in front of the camera which had been set up in Storm Models' glamorous little vestibule, it has been difficult for her to remember she is not at work.</p> <p>Staring directly into the lens, as her little dog Tombi waits patiently on the floor, she composes herself instinctively into confident posture number 48 with half-smile. And when the camera snaps, and its burst of light subsides, there she is again, this time in pouting posture 17. It is the jerky dance of fashion photography, half-ridiculous when seen in the flesh - like someone playing musical statues to a broken record - and yet no one standing here now could be in any doubt that they were watching a professional. </p> <p>\"It's very hard work,\" Shipster agrees. \"It takes a long time to get the particular shot that really works ... People perceive it as: you're pretty enough, you're tall enough, you've got the right figure, you stand in front of the camera, boom, boom, boom. Hooray, you've got the shot! But really, it's actually much harder than that. And that surprised me, I think. It surprises everyone that you really have to give it your all, otherwise you just get really boring, awful photos. And you don't get booked again.\"</p> <p>We leave the vestibule, and make our way towards a small meeting room inside the office, past a row of sofas where a constantly replenished line of beautiful children is waiting, arms around their portfolios, hoping to be picked for stardom. \"I got spotted by another agency when I was 16,\" Shipster explains. It is a story she sounds accustomed to explaining. \"I was quite a nervous, quiet, shy teenager anyway, and I was just standing there in Topshop going, 'Oh? What? What are you saying to me?'... I remember being by myself and I felt quite confused, because I'd never really thought about it. They were very nice, but I think I was quite taken aback.\"</p> <p>In truth, it had been obvious for some time to Shipster's family that she might grow up to be model material. \"My mother had always said, 'Oh, you've got cheekbones,'\" she remembers, acting out the voice. \"And I think even my godfather said that I had a 'freakishly long lower leg'. I thought that was quite strange. I was more concerned that I wore glasses, my ears stuck out and I was quite flat-chested when I was younger.\"</p> <p>Somewhat stunned by her Topshop experience, Shipster did not take up the scout's invitation. And yet the idea fermented in her memory until one afternoon, when she had a few hours to spare in London, she dropped into Storm to see what would happen. She had a go in front of the camera, went to a few castings during the holidays, and quickly discovered that she loved it.</p> <p>But what was the \"it\"? I want to know. What exactly about posing for a photographer did she love? \"You get to dress up and be someone else,\" she says, smiling. \"You play a part in front of the camera. It's funny: when you see your hair and makeup being done, it directs you as to what kind of person you get to be for the day - I don't know if that's just me. It's like wearing a mask. You get to play a part without the vulnerability, and that's what I like about it - or liked about it then.\"</p> <p>Subsequently, of course, she began to enjoy the model's life as well. \"In my gap year, I really started to work quite a lot,\" she explains, \"and I found I really enjoyed it. Travelling, meeting everybody - I think that's why I continued to do it.\" The gap year, needless to say, became a gap decade.</p> <p>Nevertheless, from the very beginning, Shipster found that her exciting new career was not always an easy thing to talk about. \"People react very differently when you say you are a model,\" she says. \"I think it's the same with other jobs that are perceived as being glamorous, or anything like that.\" At school, in particular, she recalls encountering hostility from classmates who resented her presumptuousness in believing she was a suitable subject for photographers.</p> <p>\"I think people see that as being quite arrogant in a way,\" she says. \"I remember there was this guy in my maths class who was really down on me for being a model. And at the end of my gap year I was walking into Storm ... and he was there.\" Her voice curls delightedly into a squeak. \"I was like, 'Oh! Er, hi ...' He didn't get taken on.\"</p> <p>Shipster's career, however, flourished. And her breakthrough came when she won the Pretty Polly underwear campaign. \"I think that was the first big thing,\" she says, \"and [it] taught me that I could do underwear, which I'd never really thought of doing before.\" It was also a valuable lesson in the importance, for any successful model, of being versatile.</p> <p>Besides doing underwear jobs for billboards and magazines, Shipster also works on catalogues and television commercials, and currently has a contract with the French leather label Jitrois. She also does \"showroom\" work, \"which is when you go to a designer when they're selling their collections to various shops, and you're literally putting on all the clothes\".</p> <p>Comfortable with her body, she also recently posed naked (with thong) for the cover image on the new James Bond novel Devil May Care. \"The best bit about the whole job,\" she remembers, \"was that on the day that they launched it I got to go down the Thames in a red leather catsuit with the first seven copies, with the navy ... and helicopters. Then I got to hand them over and got a Bentley for the day. It was like, 'This is a really good job!' The next day I was on the bus going to work, and I was like, 'Where's my Bentley?'\"</p> <p>One place where she has not triumphed, however, is on the catwalk. \"I've done it a couple of times, but I'm not that tall - 5ft 9in,\" she explains apologetically, \"Girls on the catwalk tend to be 5ft 10in or 5ft 11in.\" And I'm just not that good at it, if I'm really brutally honest. My walk isn't brilliant. I never was completely right for it, I think.\" Even so, there have been exceptions. Just the other day, for instance, she did a catwalk show in Vienna for Agent Provocateur - and enjoyed it. \"It's quite liberating when you walk out in front of 45,000 people in your underwear,\" she grins.</p> <p>For advertising jobs, Shipster can earn \u00a3500 a day or more. But like all but the most famous models, she also works occasionally for free, or very little, on magazine spreads. \"You want different photos,\" she explains, \"because there's a limited amount of clients and a limitless amount of models. If I go in and I've got the same photos [in my portfolio] that I had last year, then it looks like I haven't done anything.\"</p> <p>After we finish, for instance, she is off to spend several days in Amsterdam being shot by 10 different photographers for a special issue of Blend magazine. \"I'm getting paid nothing for it,\" she adds with some pride. \"But for me it's a great project, and also I'm getting great photos for my book.\"</p> <p>Besides keeping her portfolio looking good, of course, Shipster must also work hard to maintain her main asset - her body. \"You have to eat healthily,\" she says. \"It's not about weight so much, because you have to fit into a sample size, which is a size 10, and I'm a size 8 to 10. It's actually that you've got to look healthy. If I was eating too much horrible stuff, or not eating anything, then I don't think I'd have the energy to do what I do. I really do eat what I want, but I do exercise. I think that's a healthier way round. If you start denying yourself you get miserable.\"</p> <p>Ultimately, time - and ageing - will become Shipster's enemy. Absurd as it may sound, at the age of 25 she is already an industry veteran. \"I went to a job,\" she tells me, by way of an example, \"and this young 18-year-old male model asked me how old I was. I said 25, and he said, 'Oh, you're almost done then?' And I was like, 'Really, I'm really not.'\"</p> <p>She will be done one day - and long before retiring age. At which point various other careers, including acting, appeal to her. \"It's a complete cliche, model-turned-actress,\" she says. \"But it's a cliche for a reason, because you have to have a certain amount of confidence and be very aware of your body.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, there is work to be done, and she has a plane to catch. She has also been very busy recently with jobs for Macallan and Baileys. \"You have to be 25 years old to advertise alcohol,\" she says with a grin, as Tombi stirs herself in the corner, \"so I've got a whole new lease of life.\"</p> <h2>Curriculum vitae</h2> <p><strong>Pay </strong>\"In a good year, maybe \u00a330,000-40,000.\"</p> <p><strong>Hours </strong>Very unpredictable. \"You can turn up at 10am and be done by 12pm. But when I was shooting a commercial in Argentina, I got up at 4am and shot until midday, then got up at 2am and shot another day like that. There's no such thing as an average day.\"</p> <p><strong>Best thing </strong>\"The variety and the travelling. The idea that something really interesting can happen today, and you just don't know.\"</p> <p><strong>Worst thing </strong>\"The unpredictability. I'll say to my mum, 'I'll come to the theatre with you that night.' And then I won't because my shoot will overrun. Sometimes you have no control over the hours and therefore let people down.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the late 1980s, when Richard Price had started to make serious money as a novelist and screenwriter, he moved with his wife and two young daughters into a newly renovated loft apartment in rapidly gentrifying lower Manhattan. All four of his grandparents had arrived in the Lower East Side as immigrants to America in the early years of the century, before fanning out to Brooklyn and the Bronx in the 1920s and 30s. As for many Jewish Americans, the area was part of his childhood mythology and so, when he moved into his new home, Price was keen to show it off to his grandfather. \"So I asked him to come down there,\" he recalls, \"and he really thought I was mocking him. He told me how he'd spent his life trying to get out of this place. And now here was his grandson, his rich, successful, American grandson, paying a huge amount of money to go back.\" </p> <p>The publication next month of Price's eighth novel, Lush Life, marks his long-delayed fictional excavation of the Lower East Side. He says ever since he started out as a novelist he'd wanted to write about the area. His debut, The Wanderers, published in 1974 when he was just 24, drew heavily on his own 1960s Bronx adolescence. With subsequent novels set in and around New York City, he has built a reputation as a supreme exponent of sharp-witted crime stories, delivered in a highly charged prose that casts a light on the lives and motivations of the people who live and work in the murkier corners of inner-city America. </p> <p>The area of lower Manhattan bounded by the East River should have been perfect Price territory. \"But what could I say that was new?\" he shrugs, exuding both a restless nervous energy and laid-back deadpan comic timing. \"It's the most written about place in the world. The first job anyone ever had getting off a boat was as a trouser cutter in a Lower East Side sweatshop. The second job was writing a novel about being a trouser cutter in a Lower East Side sweatshop. The literature could fill a library, but while it was my story, it also wasn't my story, so I sort of left it alone and it has taken me a long time to come back to it.\" </p> <p>Price's own story is an equally strong American archetype. The precocious talent evident from The Wanderers attracted an eclectic group of eminent admirers. William Burroughs declared it a \"deeply moving account of confused and spiritually underprivileged youth\". On this side of the Atlantic, perhaps less predictably, John Fowles claimed not to have read \"a better fictional account of the dark side of the American dream in years\". Price followed up with three more autobiographical books before being enticed to write for Hollywood.</p> <p>At first it seemed Price was following the template of so many great writers - Fitzgerald, Faulkner, Chandler, the list goes on - drowning their talent in a lake of Hollywood excess. His cocaine use got out of hand, he didn't produce a novel for nearly a decade, but he did earn a fortune writing the script for the 16-minute version of Michael Jackson's \"Bad\" video. Looking back, however, it's clear that Price pulled off the trick that Fitzgerald and the rest had so much difficulty with. For a start, he wrote some very good films: Martin Scorsese's Hustler update The Color of Money (1986), for which he received an Oscar nomination; \"Life Lessons\", Scorsese's segment of the 1989 New York Stories trilogy; and the Al Pacino thriller Sea of Love (1989). Still a sought-after screenwriter, he has contributed several episodes of the extravagantly acclaimed crime saga The Wire and is currently adapting Tom Rob Smith's surprise Booker-longlisted thriller, Child 44, for Ridley Scott.</p> <p>And the film money he earned hasn't all been spent on desirable property - although he and his wife, artist Judith Hudson, do live in a large, art-filled townhouse near Gramercy Park, as well as having a place in Montauk on Long Island. He now also has the time, as the theory goes but the practice so often doesn't, to write critically and commercially successful fiction. His \"comeback\" novel was Clockers in 1992, in which he moved his location to Dempsy, a lightly fictionalised Jersey City, as crack cocaine began to infiltrate urban America. James Lee Burke says today that it is still \"probably the best novel written on the dope culture in inner-city America. Price is both an artist and consummate pro.\"</p> <p>Since Clockers, the arrival of a Price novel has become a literary event. When Lush Life was published in America , the New York Times fiction critic Michiko Kakutani opened her review by stating that \"No one writes better dialogue than Richard Price - not Elmore Leonard, not David Mamet, not even [Sopranos creator] David Chase.\" The novelist Michael Chabon effused about a \"descriptive eye as acute as his moral one - for no American writer has ever written with such consistent power as Price on the subject of shame, of the failure of good intentions, of life as lived in the gap between Intention and Act.\"</p> <p>Price says he was prompted to take a closer look at the Lower East Side when his own teenage children began hanging out in its bars and boutiques - \"if you'd said the word 'boutique' to my grandfather, he'd have assumed it was a French word for a whore or something\". But while he knew he would find middle-class kids and the ghosts of his, and their, ancestors, \"I didn't know there were still housing projects filled with black and Hispanic people. Tenements untouched by the rehab craze, orthodox Jews, old hippies who came down in the 60s, and the biggest chunk of undocumented Chinese workers in the country. They live like the Jews did in 1890 with overcrowded rooms, every penny they make going either to the smuggler who brought them in or the family in the old country.\"</p> <p>A story from a cop contact further piqued his interest: after the suicide of a Chinese man, the police went to his address in a \"beat-up tenement on Orchard St\", where they found a luxuriously rehabbed apartment occupied by two young, white middle-class professionals. Then they rang the bell next door. \"And behind the identical fa\u00e7ade were the creaky wooden staircases, the rats running round, and dozens of rooms in which Chinese guys rent a plank of wood as wide as a library shelf on which they sleep. That was the Lower East Side. Worlds literally inches away from each other and yet entirely separate. I wanted to write about how these different groups of people occupy the same physical space, but seem not to even see each other.\"</p> <p>His way into the story was via two highly publicised murders of bar-hopping middle-class kids in muggings that went wrong. \"I was aware that these were very rare events. It's happened twice in 10 years. But when there's a gun, there has to be a conversation. And then the investigation can legitimately enter all the worlds down there to come to a conclusion. It gave me access.\" The primary character, apart from the Lower East Side itself, is Eric Cash, a thirtysomething who still, just, calls himself a writer - he once had a short story published in a now defunct magazine - but actually earns his living by bar work. \"And there, but for the grace of God, go I,\" says Price. \"If I hadn't got published at 24, I really don't know whether I would have stuck at it into my 30s. I was the first college graduate in my family, and the last thing they would have understood was their child saying I want to be a dancer. Would I have stuck at telemarketing or driving a cab to support my writing habit while my Cornell friends were lawyers? I really don't know. Thank God it's hypothetical.\"</p> <p>Price was born in the Bronx in 1949 and grew up in a \"blue-collar, racially mixed, punch-on-the-nose-at-worst housing project. Just as the Lower East Side was a starter kit for the new world, so public housing was a starter kit for a respectable working-class life. It was affordable rents for not-so-bad apartments, so people spent all their money on getting the next generation to college. And it worked pretty well as a launching pad until well into the 1960s, when for many reasons the projects stopped being seen as a step up.\"</p> <p>There were books at home and a certain respect for literature. His factory-worker grandfather wrote poems in Russian Yiddish that Price would see in pamphlets from the Young Men's Hebrew Association. \"I remember being a kid in his house in Brooklyn and seeing his name at the end of a poem, which I knew was a poem only because the lines seemed to end arbitrarily. And I saw my father looking at his father with real reverence. Writing was something I wanted to do.\"</p> <p>Price won a place at Cornell - \"some parts of Cornell are easier to get into than others\" - where he studied labour relations. \"I didn't give a damn about any of it, but in retrospect I'm glad I wasn't an English major. Spending all day talking about Tolstoy and then going home to write your 19-year-old crap - it would be demoralising.\" After graduating he applied to seven writing programmes and was rejected by six. \"My parents had a hosiery store in the Bronx. They wanted me to go to law school or anywhere that my degree would end in a job interview. And there was I Hamlet-ing around saying I don't know what to do. Finally my father said 'go to your goddamn writing programme. If it doesn't work out you can go to law school.\" It worked out. \"When I published The Wanderers, the only other 24-year-old to publish a novel was Martin Amis with The Rachel Papers. The median age for a first-time novelist in America was about 40. Which made far more sense. At least they had a life to write about.\"</p> <p>In fact, Price's life so far provided plenty of material, and he says he wrote the book knowing he \"had moved on and my Bronx existed only in as much as I could remember it. I had this real urge to crystallise it and keep it from evaporating.\" Chabon described the book as \"a loose-knit Bronx myth cycle . . . that reads like a bunch of twice-told tales honed and crafted to wow upstaters\" and includes a blend of \"the preposterous with deadeye detail\". Price acknowledges, despite many critics insisting on his documentary verisimilitude, an attempt to produce a heightened style. \"I wanted to capture the tone of a group of friends getting together 15 years after the event, having a drink and saying 'remember when'. Everything was a little more linear than it actually was, a little more exaggerated and a little more heroic.\"</p> <p>Of all the overwhelmingly positive responses, the most gratifying for Price came from Hubert Selby Jr in the New York Times, who praised a \"superbly written book\" and Price as someone who \"respects his art and his subject, and illuminates our daily world with insights that allow us - at times force us - to feel closer to other human beings whether we like and approve of them or not\". </p> <p>Coming across Selby's Last Exit to Brooklyn in his late teens was the most important literary discovery of Price's life. \"It was the first time I'd read a book with concrete in it. I'd read and enjoyed Dickens and Steinbeck, Shakespeare, Jane Austen and the rest of the public-school canon. But I couldn't place myself in any of it. My childhood was a lot less dire than Selby's world of pill-heads and junkies and transvestites and working-class guys going on strike. But I heard every voice in the book as if they were standing next to me. I actually called him up to say thank you and he picked up the phone and spoke in this high-pitched nasal Brooklyn voice which came as a shock to me. I don't know why I thought he might speak like Sir John Gielgud.\" </p> <p>Price followed up his debut with three more autobiographical novels before finding himself, aged just 32, having \"written about my life up to last night. And I'd become bored with myself.\" So he took up some of the increasingly frequent offers to write screenplays. \"Even at best,\" he says, \"it's like being the mechanical draughtsman rather than the architect of a building.\" Yet \"the good thing about that period was that I continued to write, I made money and it forced me out of autobiography. I learned that I could go to other places and you're not required by law to write about the place you grew up in, or what creeps your parents were, or how great your parents were.\"</p> <p>Clockers led to two more Dempsy novels, Freedomland (1998), in which racial tensions skew the search for a missing child, and Samaritan (2003), about a TV scriptwriter volunteering to teach at an inner-city school, as Price has done. Clockers also, indirectly, led to The Wire, with Price's friend and Wire creator David Simon citing it as a prime source for his much-acclaimed series. When Simon asked him to write some episodes, Price was at first daunted. \"Something like Clockers doesn't go above ground level. It was all about front-line troops, junkies and cops. These Wire guys took it right up to City Hall and corrupt congressmen. That hadn't been what I did.\"</p> <p>Price is adamant about the status of his work as fiction - not documentary or journalism - and says he retains the view that \"if you want to send a message, go to Western Union\". But he does admit to having some wider social purpose in his treatment of the Lower East Side in Lush Life. As Simon has noted, there were more murders on the Law &amp; Order TV shows last year than there were real murders in Manhattan. The Lower East Side in particular has been utterly transformed in a generation.</p> <p>\"And now many people in New York seem to be nostalgic for places that looked like shit-holes. Do I want lines of heroin addicts queuing round the block? No. But I did want to deal with the fact that real estate is violence. You have a neighbourhood that has been a certain way and then somebody makes a cappuccino. The realtors smell that and it becomes a gold mine. A lot of people are uprooted and for every person who gets in the papers for committing a crime, there are 25 people who never did anything wrong in their lives. The thing I really relate to is the changing character of the place. The Lower East Side is now nearly like everywhere else. I know this could sound very liberal and sentimental, but it really isn't about 'poor people good', 'rich people bad'. It's just that a bit of history has been lost.\"</p> <h2>Price on Price</h2> <p>\"Restless, they finally pull out to honeycomb the narrow streets for an hour of endless tight right turns: falafel joint, jazz joint, gyro joint, corner. Schoolyard, cr\u00eaperie, realtor, corner. Tenement, tenement, tenement museum, corner. Pink Pony, Blind Tiger, muffin boutique, corner. Sex shop, tea shop, synagogue, corner. Boulangerie, bar, hat boutique, corner. Iglesia, gelateria, matzo shop, corner. Bollywood, Buddha, botanica, corner. Leather outlet, leather outlet, leather outlet, corner. Bar, school, bar, school, People's Park, corner. Tyson mural, Celia Cruz mural, Lady Di mural, corner. Bling shop, barbershop, car service, corner. And then finally, on a sooty stretch of Eldridge, something with potential: a weary-faced Fujianese in a thin Members Only windbreaker, cigarette hanging, plastic bags dangling from crooked fingers like full waterbuckets, trudging up the dark, narrow street followed by a limping black kid half a block behind.\"</p> <p>I actually don't like to write so I have to work myself up. This was me trying to get something going about these cops riding round the Lower East Side in a bogus taxi. I wanted this quality of them making right turn after right turn for hours on end all night, so I started this incantatory chant of the properties they were passing. And reading it back it seemed to say something about what this place was and what it had once been. Sometimes you have to jump up and down on a motorcycle pedal 10 times. This was the moment when it caught and it became like an overture to the book.</p>",

  "<p>For environmental campaigners who are also republicans, the Prince of Wales is a bit of a thorn in the flesh. He's involved in just about all the principal issues - championing organic agriculture, supporting local produce, rainforest campaigning, and sounding off about GM foods. Whereas in the past it might have been possible to ignore him as an eccentric fellow traveller, these days his views often sound so like those of the leading environmental NGOs, that increasingly they are having to ask themselves: does he know what he's talking about? Is he an asset or a liability? </p> <p>This questioning is likely to become more insistent over the coming year. Prince Charles turns 60 in November and some people will ask more loudly than before: what is an ageing prince for? Insofar as he asks himself the same question, it seems that focussing on the environment is the answer. Last year he set up Rainforests Project, giving himself a year to come up with action to save the rainforests. The man, whose main role was ticking off politicians and newspaper editors in letters written in green ink, seems to be finally settling on a role as the environmental conscience of the nation.</p> <p>It is easy to mock Prince Charles - and large sections of the media have done so in the wake of his latest outburst, earlier this week, on GM food. He has a strange, strangulated, plummy accent. He tends towards hyperbole, on this occasion describing GM crops as \"the biggest disaster, environmentally, of all time\". He often looks and sounds silly, as when he sung the praises of \"wibbly wobbly carrots\", while dressed in ancient tweeds and carrying a shepherd's crook. And he famously loses his temper, becoming more and more like his irascible father with every passing year. According to Jeff Randall, the Daily Telegraph journalist who interviewed him on this occasion, Prince Charles \"jabbed\" at him with his finger and was \"bouncing in his chair\" while setting out \"his nightmare vision\", a world in which millions of small farmers \"are driven off their land [by global conglomerates] into unsustainable, unmanageable, degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness\". Out of context, that statement rivals his views on nanotechnology a few years ago - comments which came to be known as his \"grey goo\" moment after he apparently spoke of the horror of such technology turning the world to grey goo.</p> <p>But even though many newspapers wheeled out scientists to denounce Prince Charles as \"unscientific\", he has garnered significant support. Several commentators noted that in fact the scientific community was far from united in support of GM crops, while Patrick Holden, the director of the Soil Association, rallied to support his seriousness and expertise. The Daily Mail, consistent in its hostility to GM \"Frankenstein foods\", said Prince Charles had \"put forward serious arguments that need to be heard and struck a resounding chord with the public\". </p> <p>\"His comments are being misrepresented,\" says journalist Felicity Lawrence. \"He was actually talking at the time about how to support local food producers in Scotland, something he knows a lot about. I suspect his explosion about farmers going to live in horrible cities wasn't like his denunciation of the modern UK city along the lines of his 'hideous carbuncle' speech, it was addressing how, if you pursue further industrialisation of agriculture, it inevitably means growers are displaced from the land and will end up in mega slums. This isn't wild fantasy. It's describing what is happening.\" </p> <p>No one doubts Prince Charles's commitment to the environment. It has been a lifelong passion - sometimes derided, as when he famously announced that he always talked to his plants, but often prescient. He set up a natural filter bed and water recycling system at Highgrove in Gloucestershire long before most people were aware of the need to conserve water. His Rainforests Project makes explicit his desire to make an impact in his 60th year on what he considers the world's most pressing problem: deforestation. But the cause to which he remains closest is promoting organic food production and small-scale local farming. He's been an organic farmer since the 1980's, and set up the highly profitable Duchy Originals in 1992. An organic food company, it helps small farmers find new markets for their goods while promoting more sustainable production. </p> <p>\"He has many interests,\" says Paddy Harverson, his communications secretary. \"But farming is right at the top not least because he's a farmer. He spends a lot of time on Home Farm in Gloucestershire and takes an immense interest in contemporary farming. This year he is Patron of the Year of Food and Farming and most small farmers would see him as a friend and advocate.</p> <p>\"The Daily Telegraph interview was given to highlight The North Highland Initiative. That's one of the four or five initiatives he has set up to help farmers' products become more competitive by using imaginative marketing solutions.\"</p> <p>The prince's interest in food and food production is one of the main reasons he is once again mired in political controversy. The current food crisis, say critics of the food industry, has allowed the supporters of GM to come rushing back into government circles offering biotechnology as a solution. His spokespeople are keen to insist that debating issues of food production and food security are not political but social and environmental. But as the global food crisis moves centre stage and politicians position themselves, that distinction will be harder to maintain. Could Prince Charles become more than a royal mascot for the greens? His seriousness is not in dispute but does he have the depth of understanding to be a spokesman environmentalists would be happy to line up behind? </p> <p>\"Was he talking nonsense?\" says Andrew Simms, the policy director at the New Economics Foundation. \"No, but I think he was overstating it. If someone asked me what was the most serious issue affecting the environment at the moment I'd say climate change rather than biotechnology. Biotechnology is a very important issue. There are lots of scientific and health issues connected with it that are still unanswered. But the most important issue about biotechnology is that the vast majority of applications which have come out of research into GM have had nothing to solving the problems of poverty, hunger and food security and everything to do with extending the control which agri-business has over the food chain.\" </p> <p>According to Simms, tackling food security and hunger necessarily entail issues of social justice and redistribution. \"If you do ask how to go about solving those issues, biotechnology would be quite low down. Higher up would be solutions such as giving people more entitlement to the land, land reform, redirecting agricultural extension services to small farmers, and looking at a wide range of sustainable farming techniques which don't rely on invasive high technology approaches but build on farmers' existing knowledge.\" </p> <p>And if the real solutions to food security and sustainable food production entail equitable redistribution, where does Prince Charles - a person of immense, almost unimaginable privilege, stand on these issues? \"What is really interesting\" says Lawrence, \"is that he's talking about corporate control and its effect on agriculture. It's not exactly leftwing but it is radical. I would place him in that tradition of philanthropic, experimental landowners like Robert Owen, who does things in a patriarchal and paternalistic way but genuinely wants to leave the world a better place.\" </p> <p>There are other examples of this kind of paternalistic philanthropy in Britain, including around food production. Mac Fisheries was set up by William Hesketh Lever, one of the Lever Brothers, in the early 1920s as an attempt to guarantee work for the fishing community on and around the Isle of Harris. </p> <p>It may also be the case that environmental issues are recasting the old left/right divisions. Figures such as Zac Goldsmith, Peter Melchett, Jonathan Porritt and even David Cameron - people who might all fit the description \"radical toffs\" - are involved in causes which could easily bring them into conflict with the activities of big corporations. But even if old alignments are changing there is a long way to go to overcome most people's ambivalence about embracing Prince Charles as a green superhero or even as a spokesman. </p> <p>\"He says he's concerned,\" says Simms. \"But he doesn't strike me as being too concerned about poverty and poverty reduction.\" Others would be harsher. Ken Wharfe, the former royal protection officer for Princess Diana who had the opportunity to observe the prince at first hand, says: \"The point is that Charles, for all his current 'voice of the people' role, is someone whose life is wrapped in cotton wool, where every whim is catered for and not challenged. </p> <p>\"I remember leaving Balmoral one evening with the Prince of Wales in a convoy of four vehicles, suddenly to be instructed to return immediately to the castle. Fearing a real emergency I asked why, he told me that he had left an electric light on, and not to turn it off would be a terrible waste of electricity. So the whole convoy returned to extinguish the light. I don't begrudge the Prince of Wales his reed and lily bed for the natural recycling of liquid waste. It's just that no one seems to notice how totally at odds it is with all the devotion to detail and excess which is the hallmark of his life at Highgrove.\"</p> <p>\"Prince Charles is who he is and says what he says. And that's fine\" adds Simms. \"But I don't think he should stand as a spokesperson for the broader environmental and social justice system. The trouble is we are trapped in a celebrity culture and royalty is part of that. There are many voices out there possibly more suited to speak - people who know more about the issues in greater depth and from the perspective of global justice. But it's a celebrity system and celebrities crowd out more informed voices.\"</p>",
  "<p>A hot midday on a hillside overlooking Ramallah, a blue sky with some bashful, short-lived clouds and Palestinian flags everywhere, side by side with his photo - and the voice of Mahmoud Darwish reciting his own poetry came pure and powerful through the huge loudspeakers and covered the whole landscape. In the middle of the courtyard of Ramallah's Cultural Palace, where he'd given his last poetry reading a few weeks ago (at which he read \"The Dice Player\"), the empty grave was waiting for the body of the poet. The roads up the hill carried wave after wave of people of all ages and affiliations, all trying hard to get as close as possible to the grave to say goodbye to their poet. As the coffin was lowered into the ground, a small regiment of Palestinian security officers had to restrain a crowd struggling to look at the grave, and another fired 21 shots in salute. </p> <p>We circled around the grave, and I found myself next to his mother, Houria, aged 92 - who was brought from Galilee in an ambulance and brought on a wheelchair to have a last glance at her boy, whose most famous line is \"I yearn for my mother's bread and my mother's coffee\" - and his two brothers, Ahmad and Zaki. I saw his sisters only after the ceremony was over. The family was almost apologetic for their presence among those thousands of mourners; his mother, in her feeble, broken voice, said: \"He is the son of all of you.\" This was the first time I had seen his mother. She does not travel, and I am not allowed to go to Galilee.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, just before 10am, Darwish's body arrived on a flight from the United States in Amman, Jordan. After a short ceremony the casket was loaded on to a Jordanian military helicopter, which flew to Ramallah, landing at noon. Far from Ramallah, a procession left the Ahihud junction, east of Acre, heading towards the former village of Al-Birweh, where Darwish was born. A symbolic funeral was held there, as youths recited Darwish's poems. What an embarrassment to those who accuse the Palestinians of all sorts of evil. Now you have thousands and thousands of Palestinians with poems and roses in their hands, going out to honour a poet whose lines are full of butterflies, doves, bees, ancient mythology and biblical allusions. They are out for beautiful verse, and that's it. This is praise for them and also for their poet, who proved to them only through his aesthetic experiments the value of art and its charms. Those are the same people who filled halls and theatres and auditoriums to listen to him. Many more people like them in most of the Arab countries were no less enthusiastic. In 2002, an audience of 25,000 Lebanese and Palestinians living in the refugee camps of Lebanon filled a football stadium in Beirut to listen for three hours to his fascinating words. Occupation and dictatorship do everything possible to suppress their victims' desire for any kind of self-expression. But the victims do express themselves: they do it politically, through acts of resistance, and culturally, through songs, folk dances, handicrafts, memoirs and poems. By self-expression they achieve self-assertion, and this makes them stronger and guards them against self-pity and sentimentality. This explains the precious unwritten contract between Palestinian and Arab writers, as masters of expression, and their audience.</p> <p>Darwish gave them this without sacrificing his self-imposed aesthetic ambitions and rules. I think it is safe to say that this is what distinguished him among Arab poets. But Darwish did not come out of nowhere, and his absence will not be the end of excellent Palestinian poetry. This land needs its poets and will always have them.</p> <p>Long ago Darwish had walked out of professional politics, out of his literary quarterly Al Karmil, out of two very brief, almost unpublicised, childless marriages. From August 9 2008, Mahmoud, as we used to call him, will live among us as pure poetry, exactly as he'd always wished.</p> <p>I phoned him from Cairo just before what turned out to be his final trip, and he told me he knew the risks of failed surgery in his case: paralysis or death. \"I can accept death,\" he said. Now his famous shyness will not prevent him from accepting our invitation to stay with us a bit longer; he will walk freely in our reading hours and our bedrooms. </p> <p>The story of the Palestinian people since their nakba is a story of unfulfilled desires: the desire for normal life, for justice, for national independence and freedom, but even Mahmoud had to come to this cheerless conclusion: \"I thought poetry could change everything, could change history and could humanise, and I think that the illusion is very necessary to push poets to be involved and to believe. But now I think that poetry changes only the poet.\"</p> <p>This time he was wrong. This man's poetry has changed the language of Arabic writing and shifted readers' conceptions of resistance poetry. The drums receded to give way to the harp and the flute. Single-coloured khaki poems full of slogans gave way to rainbow-intertwined shades. Even the physical image of the victimised and the oppressed had to give way to Mahmoud's unmatched elegance in dress and in daily conversation alike.</p> <p>As a poet, he had that overwhelming presence of an elderly figure, while as a person he was like the beloved youngest son in the family, a polite and vulnerable grandson, for whom you are tempted to do anything to protect him from harm. In this world of polluted international political language, where the word \"freedom\" is abused in every manner, referring to everything from capitalism to the occupation of Iraq, Mahmoud's poetry and life were an attempt to give it back its meaning. This was his destiny because he was a poet, and also because he was an Arab and a Palestinian. </p> <p>Born in Al-Birweh, a Palestinian village in northern Galilee that was completely destroyed by the Zionist militias that built the state of Israel in 1948, he fled the country with his family, only to return in secret to live in an adjacent Arab village that had escaped destruction. Like those Arab Palestinians who stayed in the state of Israel, he lived under military rule, confiscation of lands and constraints on movement until 1966. He therefore joined the only non-Zionist political party in Israel, the Israeli Communist party. For many Arabs, their class and national identities were congruent; they were poor and oppressed, because they were Arabs. </p> <p>Belonging to a political party, however, brings its own constraints. The choice offered to Mahmoud, like that historically offered to many of his people, is a choice between shackles and shackles: a choice between the shackles of occupation and the shackles of resisting it. In the early 1970s he decided to leave. He went to Egypt and then to Lebanon. In a press conference in Cairo, he said: \"I changed my place, but not my position.\" He left Palestine, to join the Palestine Liberation Organisation.</p> <p>Here is another paradox that Mahmoud shares with his people: in the Arab world, Palestinians are in exile, but they are not strangers. Mahmoud's life in Egypt, and later in Lebanon, was not a disconnection from Palestine - rather, it made him more of a pan-Arab poet, which in turn made him more of a Palestinian one. </p> <p>Mahmoud was at the centre of Arab culture in the 20th century because he was a poet, and a Palestinian. Poetry lies at the centre of all Arab arts, and Palestine at the centre of Arab collective consciousness. A poem about Palestine was therefore a poem to all Arabs.</p> <p>Among the many arts that the Arabs have produced without interruption over 15 centuries of their history, poetry is still the most celebrated. Arab cultural identity revolves around language. The eloquence of the Qur'an was the proof of its divinity. The beauty of a line of poetry turned it into a proverb with all the moral authority of law or tradition. The role of poetry in creating collective identity among Arabs is well known. It is no coincidence that the prophet of the Arabs was called by some a poet, and that three centuries later Al-Mutanabbi, the greatest poet in medieval Arab history, called himself a prophet.</p> <p>Among the Palestinians this passion for poetry is heightened, because their collective identity is negated by their enemies and the rulers of the world. Poetry becomes a means of collective self-expression and hence of collective self-assertion. As such, it is safe to say that Mahmoud's poetry was never dissociated from Palestine and the Palestinian struggle for freedom. However, being an Arab Palestinian poet made him a spokesman for the Palestinian and Arab struggles for freedom, and that in itself was a heavier constraint on his freedom of writing and style.</p> <p>Mahmoud's later poetry was a continuous attempt to break free from the shackle-like crown bestowed on him by his people. Nonetheless, in his writing, these intentional attempts to make the struggle absent only made it all the more present, for one cannot intend to forget without remembering the very thing that one wants to forget.</p> <p>The paradoxical tension between freedom and its shackles was reflected in Mahmoud's relations with his friends, foes and political authority. He was close to the Palestinian leadership, whether in the phase of the PLO or the Palestinian Authority after Oslo. Nonetheless, he maintained a distance. Palestine had chosen his comrades for him, and he did not always like the choice. He once told me that, were it not for \"the struggle\", \"I would not have returned a good morning to many of those who now say they are my friends\". </p> <p>Like a kind of scientist, Mahmoud spent his life concocting Palestinian national identity, though its links to the land, and to the Arabic language and culture, were established long before him. In his poetry he tried to link that identity to a humanist global culture, to pre-Arab and pre-Islamic cultures of the Middle East, and to those details of human life that are beautiful in any culture or place. In doing so, he was not only asserting the humanity of the Palestinians, so often denied by Zionist discourse, but he was also humanising humanism to his people. To them and to Arabs, humanism was the discourse of a colonial invader who spoke about freedom and human rights, but gave them the state of Israel and military occupation and the prison at Abu Ghraib. In his poetry Mahmoud was trying to strengthen the ever-thinning thread between the Arabs and western culture, of which they have had very bad experiences. Already entrenched in his Arab culture and language, he started visiting other traditions in writing, style and content.</p> <p>It was certainly a sad moment on the hillside overlooking the city of Ramallah, just 16km from the prohibited Jerusalem, suffocated by the apartheid wall and military checkpoints. It was even a tragic moment for Mahmoud Darwish to die, leaving his people in this unprecedented vulnerability caused by the mistakes of their political leadership and the bloody and absurd fratricidal divisions that have emerged between the leading Palestinian factions over an illusory and ridiculous power. The nationwide grief for the loss of Mahmoud is partly a grass-roots protest against those worthless politicians on both sides of the divide. </p> <p>Darwish's complex legacy cannot be understood without reference to the political role he played, or was persuaded to play, however short or interrupted that was, but it would always be wise to place it in the context of the wider Palestinian question, which only becomes more complicated as time goes by, instead of reaching a just solution. On the hillside overlooking Ramallah, the Palestinian leadership intended to stage a funeral for a member of the PLO, while the people, who came out in their thousands with lines of his poems in their hands and on their shirts, and who were continuing a line of verse before he'd finished reading it, made it a poet's funeral. Mahmoud Darwish had once been a member of the PLO executive committee, but he resigned a very long time ago, and he finally emerged as one of the great Arab poets of modern times. The PLO wanted to celebrate his past. People celebrated his future. They were sure, and I am sure, that a real poet is one who never takes his future with him when he is laid to rest.</p> <h2> from The Dice Player</h2> <p>. . .

  "<p>Joey Barton was described as \"a model professional\" by Kevin Keegan yesterday, but the Newcastle United midfielder cannot escape his less than angelic past. It emerged yesterday that he is facing a civil legal action for allegedly ruining the career of Jason Tandy, a former team-mate at Manchester City.</p> <p>Barton - recently released from prison after serving 74 days of a six-month sentence for an assault in Liverpool city centre last December - allegedly stubbed a lit cigar in the face of Tandy, then a City youth player, at the team's Christmas party in 2004. No police action was taken at the time but the midfielder was fined by his former club.</p> <p>Tandy's legal representatives have confirmed that the 23-year-old is pursuing a civil claim for damages against Barton. He claimed he suffered a \"major psychiatric deterioration\" following the cigar incident, which he said ultimately forced him out of the game at the top level.</p> <p>Matthew Clayton, of Manchester-based law firm Ralli, said: \"Mr Tandy is a client of ours and we are in the process of launching civil proceedings. As a result of the assault by Joey Barton our client has suffered a major psychiatric deterioration in his health that has destroyed any chance he may have had of playing professional football at a high level.\"</p> <p>Coincidentally Keegan, Barton's current manager at Newcastle, was in charge of City in December 2004 and yesterday he defended a player also currently facing a potential 15-match Football Association ban for his training-ground attack on Ousmane Dabo, another former City team-mate, in May 2007. The Dabo assault became the subject of a criminal action and, after pleading guilty to it earlier this summer, Barton received a four-month suspended prison sentence.</p> <p>\"Since I have been here Joey has been a model pro,\" stressed Keegan. \"He deserves another chance, call it a last chance if you like but he deserves one. \"</p> <p>Tandy was released by City after he broke his leg while playing on loan with a Danish club. He is understood to be on the verge of joining non-league Hyde United on semi-professional terms.</p>",

It is believed the ceremony took place at St John the Evangelist Church, in Cilybebyll, where they married on July 12.</p> <p>The family said plans were being made for a funeral service to allow extended family members, friends and colleagues to pay their respects later this month.</p> <p>They requested no flowers and said details of a memorial fund would be announced in due course.</p> <p>Swansea coroner Philip Rogers released the bodies for burial as he opened and adjourned an inquest into the couple's deaths on Tuesday.</p> <p>The coroner was told that Mrs Mullany, a 31-year-old doctor, died instantly in the shooting and Mr Mullany, a 31-year-old trainee physiotherapist, died a week later at Morriston Hospital in Swansea.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Jill Tunstall, 46</strong><br>Cards on the table? I've always felt that today's parents are a pampered breed. Legislation for this, time off for that, allocated parking spaces in Tesco ... I mean, how hard can it be? </p> <p>I arrive, after leaving two pages of detailed notes about my cat, my house and my library books, to find Alice halfway out of the door. \"Hero needs to be at her music lesson in an hour and she'd like her hair cut,\" are the only two instructions I get before she leaves with almost indecent haste.</p> <p>Suddenly, I am in charge of two kids, a huge B&amp;B, 15 guests (not the eight I was promised), an alsatian, two cats, three chickens and a hamster.</p> <p>It couldn't be further from my own life. At 46, and by choice, I live and work alone in a modest house on the North Wales coast, my only responsibilities a mortgage and an elderly cat. Instead of assuming more responsibilities with age, I am living the life of a carefree thirtysomething.</p> <p>Yet here I am in charge of what could, potentially, become the domestic version of the Titanic during my captaincy.</p> <p>But there is no time to contemplate my incarceration as I realise that we need to get cracking to make the music lesson. \"Get your shoes on,\" I instruct the children. Ten minutes later, I discover that neither has taken a bit of notice. </p> <p>We finally get there - 10 minutes late - and I realise Tybalt is wearing his mother's walking boots and two pairs of trousers. While his sister Hero, nine, performs her scales, I take Tybalt, my godson, to the outdoor shop. He wants everything, especially penknives. We leave with a pair of slippers, three sizes too big, that he insists he will grow into. </p> <p>An hour in and I'm already the victim of pester power. I've earned a coffee, I reckon, and head for a cafe where I tell the children to grab the sofas. Tybalt orders a chocolate cone with double choc-chip chocolate ice cream, a chocolate flake and a fudge stick. As I hand it to him, Hero tells me Tybalt sometimes has to go to his bedroom when he has too much chocolate. </p> <p>Later - at the end of the swap and by then far too late - I also discover that shandy with their pub supper, lemonade with breakfast and coffee at any time are also not allowed. </p> <p>I get them home and realise the chicken won't be cooked until 8pm - their bedtime. I bang it in the oven as the children start chasing each other round and round the kitchen in a sugar-fuelled frenzy. Just as I begin to get really, really tired of it all, they stop squabbling and agree to peel and chop the carrots. I feel like Supernanny. </p> <p>I wake at 7am to the full horror of having to meet and greet 15 people, plus get the children ready for the day. How? </p> <p>If I started every day like this I'd have a nervous breakdown within a week. In my life it begins about 9am with coffee and newspapers. </p> <p>Then Hero arrives in the middle of breakfast in her pyjamas demanding that I straighten her hair, the toilet blocks and, as I pull on rubber gloves, the cat brings a dead mouse into the breakfast room.</p> <p>\"Are you really 52?\" asks Tybalt. No, I'm really not but I feel much, much older right at this minute, I tell him. And, I wonder, how does Alice manage this on a day-to-day basis, let alone with PMT, flu or a broken heart? I try to book the children into a skiing session so that I can tackle the B&amp;B ironing but the children scream so much I cannot hear a thing. I scream back: \"Shut up!\"</p> <p>Their eyes pop out on stalks but my position of supremacy crumbles when two B&amp;B guests walk in and I have to apologise.</p> <p>I fall into bed each night without a shower or a proper meal, and not realising that the children haven't washed, cleaned their teeth or done their homework. I'm craving solitude or a full-on night out with adults who speak my language. And my maternal instinct is as dormant as ever.</p> <p>Days later Alice returns with blow-dried hair, San Tropez tan, red dress and heels. I want to cry. I am in a tea-stained T-shirt and have just spent an hour mopping floors. \"That's how I feel when you turn up looking glamorous,\" she confides, which makes me feel quite guilty.</p> <p>But at least I'm finally free again. I say goodbye to the kids, who seem rather relieved to have their mother back, and drive away, stopping at a cafe to relish the freedom of not having to think for anybody else.</p> <p>I feel a small stab of pride at having survived Alice's life. Strangely though, the chairs opposite me do seem sadly empty and I find myself wondering if I will have anyone to mourn me when I'm gone, especially as the Tunstall line ends with me.</p> <p>Why is that important, I muse? When I'm gone, I'm gone. And then it occurs to me that all this lineage stuff is just an emotional burden heaped on women over the years to keep them busy bearing children.</p> <p>My child-free state was never a decision I took. I just never wanted them. I used to wonder whether I'd wake up one day with the over- whelming urge to create new life that other women, including my sisters, talk about - but it never happened. </p> <p>Recently it cost me a long-term relationship with my partner.</p> <p>So there was no epiphany after being at Alice's, just a realisation of what it takes if your hormones do tell you that you cannot live without children. </p> <p>Oh, and a grudging concession that, OK, maybe those supermarket parking spaces are deserved, after all. I may have a bit further to walk in the rain but, having seen the alternative, I'll take that any day of the week ...</p> <p><strong>Alice Douglas, 43</strong><br>Jill is my childless best friend. All overworked, over-achieving mothers have a childless best friend. They serve, for the mother, a dual role. On the one hand they allow us to pretend that we would be as well-dressed, well-organised, healthy, thin, successful and independent, not to mention politically informed, as they are, were it not for the fact that we are mothers. </p> <p>On the other, when we are feeling in need of some reassurance that our lives are not simply a round of spare tyres, sleeplessness and dirty hair, we can flip things over and affirm ourselves by feeling sorry for them because they haven't got children. (This works despite the fact that I know that Jill never wanted kids in the first place.)</p> <p>Even Jill's front door is calm. Not like mine, scuffed in mud from being kicked in impatience by my children as I fumble to open it. This front door is battle-scar free, spotless. I open it slowly, fearful of spoiling its pristine facade, but not slowly enough to stop Flinty, the decrepit cat, from making her getaway. </p> <p>The next thing to greet me is a tidy hallway. As if to offer a taste of the shocking comparisons to come, the image of my own front porch flashes before me. I have always dreamed of a tidy porch like this. But then I'd have to sort the hundreds of pairs of out-grown, scuffed shoes and bits of mud-splattered kit - and who knows what horrors lurk beneath.</p> <p>I tried to pacify myself. Smugness usually works, I thought. My porch-way is, after all, the stuff of life, of living - a full life. A life of children. Poor Jill, I think, smiling Madonna-like to myself.</p> <p>Despite the fact that Jill has been a patient observer for years, I have played down the chaos that is my life. The last thing I want is for her to pull the rug on my first opportunity for peace and order in nine years.</p> <p>For my part, I am looking at a glorious spell off the treadmill. Bliss. I won't even go into the deal that Jill is staring in the face.</p> <p>I slump on the sofa and stare at the order around me. I breathe a relaxed sigh. Then it begins. Solitude. Terror of my youth. I hoick up Flinty, the cat, against her will, on to the sofa beside me and begin to stroke her frantically. </p> <p>It is a little like a phobia, this long-lost enemy. Before, I was always afraid when my life wasn't filled to the brim, but I had so many fears in those days that life was one long round of running away from them. I thought that children had cured that, but now sitting alone in the delicious tranquillity of Jill's house I begin to ask myself whether, in fact, I hadn't been running all the time. How would I now cope with being forced to stop and smell the roses? Flinty, I think, Flinty will be my friend.</p> <p>I also turn to my most reliable form of diversion from complicated thoughts and started to feel peckish. As mothers know, when all else fails, eat. I decide to check out the kitchen. </p> <p>The first thing I find (and the guilt, bearing in mind that I have left nothing for Jill, is acute) are two pages of meticulous instructions. How to water the plants, how to feed the cat, how to take a library book back. That will certainly be a new experience. I shall very much enjoy the gentle five-minute walk to the library, unencumbered by children and shopping. Yes, this library book will certainly go back.</p> <p>The next thing I find - to my utter dismay - is that apart from a jar of gherkins, half a packet of oatcakes and a tin of olives, the cupboard is, as they say, absolutely bare. Jill told me later that she thought that I would enjoy the pleasure of shopping alone, for just me. The thought doesn't even occur to me. It's not that I don't know how to shop - after all, shopping in our house is usually a two-trolley, \u00a3400 affair. It's just that left with the thought of \"just me\" I am utterly lost. Thank goodness for the booze! </p> <p>As I climb up the stairs with a glass of white wine and my little plate of titbits I start to worry. How will Jill cope? What if she forgets to lock the doors or the place catches fire? What if she doesn't shut up the chickens for the night or check that we have enough sausages for breakfast? How will she manage 15 B&amp;B guests? </p> <p>Then I miss my children and the guilt starts. </p> <p>But then I remember Jill, who she is. She will cope, of course, and we will laugh about it. And life opens up. It's amazing how the hours pass with a glass of wine, a bit of peace and a telephone. And then there is Jill's fantastic library. I'll be able to read more than 10 lines without falling asleep. Perhaps solitude isn't so bad.</p> <p>In the morning, the number nine etches itself out before my eyes on the digital clock - 9am, a full 14 hours sleep. Oh, joy! </p> <p>Putting on Jill's Mindfulness CD, I gently saunter to my breakfast and to Desert Island Discs on Radio 4. This can't be true. The whole programme uninterrupted. </p> <p>The days follow serenely. I hum to myself as I water plants. I even tell my son Tybalt to stop ringing all the time. Over-anxious Mum seems to have gone on holiday too. Perhaps I realise that I might just as well worry about the sky falling down or the planet spinning off its axis as worry about the kids incessantly. </p> <p>Experiencing Jill's environment showed me that she lives her life, while my life lives me. She chose her child-free state for well thought out reasons, while I jumped into my fantasy of a big family and a welter of people coming and going without a shadow of deliberation. </p> <p>This life swap experience forced me to deal with the present in a way I never do. I usually have no time to savour the moment because I am too busy preparing for the one to come. I have promised myself that I'm going to take better care of myself. More aromatherapy baths, less toxic food. More sauvignon blanc. And more books. Jill has such lovely books.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Think top-to-toe</strong> </p> <p>Your entire body needs to be strong for tennis - for example, 50% of the power of a forehand comes from the legs and trunk - so if you're complementing tennis with weights, work on the legs, core and back, as well as arms and shoulders. </p> <p><strong>Adapt your game </strong></p> <p>As equipment has got more technical, the game has got faster. \"To cope with this power have two types of swing - a full one and an abbreviated one,\" says Simon Jones, top performance coach at the National Tennis Centre. \"The shorter swing allows you to react to fast, powerful shots. Swing fully at every ball and you'll either miss or hit it badly - you should always be hitting it when it's in front of your body.\"</p> <p><strong>Get evaluated </strong></p> <p>If you suffer repetitive injuries, ask a coach to look at your technique. For example, according to the US Tennis Association, if your hips don't rotate when you serve, it puts 28% more load on the elbow to achieve the same ball velocity.</p> <p><strong>Work all your systems </strong></p> <p>\"Tennis recruits a variety of energy systems, not just aerobic,\" Jones says. \"To get better at the fast, anaerobic sprints needed, exercises such as shuttle running or sprints down the lines on a court will boost the explosive power in your muscles.\" </p> <p><strong>Don't try this at home</strong></p> <p>If Wimbledon fever gripped you, be warned: \"Don't try to emulate Rafael Nadal - he's unique in the power he produces,\" Jones says. \"Try to hit as hard as he does and you're unlikely to control the ball. Tennis is a game of timing first, power second, so use the pace of your opponent's ball to send it back - you don't necessarily need to add speed.\"</p>",
  "<p>Police yesterday continued to search addresses across the north-west after arresting three men for alleged terrorism offences. Two men from Blackburn were arrested at Manchester airport on Thursday and a third man was detained in the Accrington area of Lancashire.</p> <p>Detectives continued to question all three men after arresting them under terrorism legislation, but would not say under which sections they were detained. The allegations relate to suspected offences committed abroad and were described as being at the \"less serious\" end of the scale.</p> <p>The men, of Asian origin, are aged 21, 22 and 23.</p> <p>The investigation is being led by the Lancashire Constabulary, with help from the Greater Manchester Police's counter-terrorism unit.</p> <p>Ibrahim Master, the former chair of the Lancashire council of mosques, said: \"The action is surprising. The community in Blackburn is mainstream. Any act of terrorism, not only does it give a bad name to Islam and Muslims, it has an adverse reaction on race relations.\"</p> <p>Police say the searches will take up to five days. Ch Supt Andy Rhodes said: \"These arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity and carried out as quickly as possible to ensure minimum impact on the three areas concerned. However, these types of enquiries can be complex and may take time to resolve. I would ask local residents to be patient with us.\"</p> <p>Martin Clough, 32, a local resident, said: \"It's quite disturbing. It's a small street and everyone gets on with everybody. For this to happen here is quite shocking.\" Clough described the family of one of the men arrested: \"They keep themselves to themselves. They don't speak. The father speaks but the sons don't.\"</p> <p>Another local resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said the family had lived there for many years, and the children had attended Islamic schools. He said: \"They were quite a law-abiding family. They've never been in trouble whatsoever. They're normal, everyday lads.\"</p>",
  "<p>Few athletes can ever have described breaking the Olympic record as a \"formality\" but Bradley Wiggins is among that select group. Yesterday, having shaved 0.134sec off his own time from Athens 2004 in beginning his defence of the 4,000m pursuit title, the 28-year-old Londoner added that he was surprised the opposition had not offered more of a challenge. </p> <p>Worryingly for Hayden Roulston, the New Zealander who looks likely to be his opponent in the final phases today, Wiggins was saving his strength.</p> <p>\"It was a formality, really, a formality,\" said Wiggins after qualifying nearly four seconds faster than Roulston. The Briton and his coaches had originally scheduled for a 4min 13sec ride - a cool two seconds under the Olympic record - but had decided to take it conservatively when his potential opponents did not go as fast as had been expected.</p> <p>\"When we saw the other times we thought we would throttle back a bit. I'm a bit surprised that no one is closer,\" Wiggins added. \"This is the Olympics after all, and I thought everyone would up their game a bit. I've worked my nuts off for this and I'd have thought everyone would have a bit more than that.\"</p> <p>The reigning world champion across his three disciplines, the Briton is aiming to take three Olympic golds in the five days of track competition beginning with the individual pursuit today, continuing with the team event tomorrow and Monday and then contesting the madison with Mark Cavendish on Tuesday.</p> <p>In his qualifier Wiggins was up against the world championship bronze medallist, Alexei Markov of Russia, the pair starting on opposite sides of the track and \"pursuing\" each other for the distance. Wiggins started steadily but was the fastest man on the track after two kilometres, by which time it was clear that he was within Olympic record pace.</p> <p>Riding with the implacable rhythm of a metronome, Wiggins never faltered and, as the third kilometre approached, he had Markov in his sights. By the finish they were in the same straight and the Briton was in total control. </p> <p>Wiggins will face the slowest qualifier, Alexander Serov of Russia, in today's second round, which will in turn decide the line-ups for the finals - with the fastest four going through to ride-offs for gold and silver, bronze and fourth.</p> <p>Steven Burke, Wiggins's 20-year-old team-mate, made his Olympic debut in fine style, catching his opponent Carlos Alzate of Colombia with two laps remaining to finish in 4min 22.26sec, knocking nine seconds off his personal best for the distance. He qualified in fifth place and will race Volodymyr Dyudya of the Ukraine this morning. For a youngster who was supposed to be merely back-up in the team pursuit, it is heady stuff. \"The ride of the day for us,\" said the performance manager, Shane Sutton</p> <p>In the biggest upset of the evening the silver medallist at the Manchester world championships, Jenning Huizenga of the Netherlands, was overhauled in the third kilometre by Roulston, finishing in a surprisingly slow 4min 37.097sec in spite of using a curious aerodynamic position, with his hands up in front of his face.</p> <p>Wiggins was not the only British pursuiter to take a starring role yesterday. The world champion, Rebecca Romero, and her team-mate, Wendy Houvenaghel, dominated the qualifying round in the women's 3,000m, both breaking the 3min 30sec barrier and finishing within a fifth of a second of each other, with Houvenaghel marginally the faster in 3min 28.443sec.</p> <p>Both dominated doughty opponents: Houvenaghel, fourth to Romero at the World Championships in Manchester, was up against the American Sarah Hammer, the silver medallist in Manchester and \"a future Olympic champion\", according to her website. Romero faced the bronze medallist, Katie Mactier. In both cases the outcome was the same: each gained implacably, with Romero blasting past the Australian in the final straight to scotch rumours that she may be below par.</p> <p>Their only opponent on yesterday's form looks to be the Ukrainian Lesya Kalitovska, more than three seconds behind, which bodes well for a weekend when they will race the second round today to decide the line-ups for tomorrow's finals. \"The two girls came up trumps,\" said Sutton, \"and Brad is back on it after a little bit of illness last week.\"</p> <p>There is certainly more to come from Wiggins. He has not even put on the afterburners yet,\" said his coach, Matt Parker, while, even if Romero and Houvenaghel are already at their very best, that should be good enough for two more medals tomorrow.</p>",
  "<p>Paula Radcliffe will wake up at 3.30am tomorrow here to seek redemption with the Olympic Games. It is a love affair that has lasted for 24 years and six days. It began with tears, and the last instalment ended the same way. What lies ahead is anyone's guess, but set your clocks for the drama - just as a budding 10-year-old Bedford runner did on August 11, 1984 when she rose in the middle of the night to watch the 3,000 metres from Los Angeles, the classic duel between Mary Decker and Zola Budd.</p> <p>\"My first Olympic memory is that race,\" says Radcliffe. \"I sat on my mum and dad's bed. They had a small television and I remember going in to see it.\" A quick resum\u00e9: Budd, the controversial South Africa-born Briton, was blamed for tripping the American heroine Decker and sending her spinning off the track and into the arms of her husband, who carried her away as she cried her eyes out. </p> <p>The last the Olympic Games saw of Radcliffe was in a similar vein. Four years ago, with three miles left of the marathon on a day of unbearable heat in Athens, the world record-holder could go on no longer. Infamously, she stopped. She sat on a kerb. She could not control her emotions. Everything that she had spent a career working towards had come to a halt on that Sunday afternoon on the most famous course of all. </p> <p>When Radcliffe takes to the start line tomorrow in Beijing - a miracle in itself, as only 12 weeks ago leading medical opinion said it would be a mission impossible because of the stress fracture of her left femur - she will not be thinking back to 2004. But maybe 1984. Not to that specific race between Decker and Budd, but to the hold the Games has had on her. She arrives here with only one race in nine months and with only one week of proper running in three months. If this was the world championships she would be a spectator.</p> <p>\"I could have done with more time when your biggest week of running is two weeks before the race,\" says Radcliffe, 34. \"It's not an ideal preparation and it's not what you would risk going into any other race. But the Olympic Games is not a race I ever want to watch on television and think what I could have done in there. I've seen all the Coe-Ovett races from 1980. It is not about a particular race but the whole aura and ethos of the Olympics.\" </p> <p>This will be the fourth time Radcliffe has run at the Games. In 1996, as a relative unknown, she finished fifth in the 5,000m final and in Sydney in 2000 she was fourth in the 10,000m after leading almost all the way. And then there was Athens. </p> <p>An unkind friend, the Olympics, to a woman who has held the lure of this greatest sporting gathering so close to her heart. But this time, whatever happens, will she finish come what may? When she stopped in Athens, she came in for serious criticism for the only time in her career. \"I could not run any further when I got to where I got to in Athens,\" she says. \"If I had run an absolutely perfect race, it would not have been any different. That is the problem. I was ill going into it.</p> <p>\"This year I am in a better situation than in Athens because I am healthy. I was not healthy going into it there. I did a lot more training and I was in better shape. Two weeks before that race in Athens, I was in outstanding shape, but it did not work out on the day.</p> <p>\"I know it's going to be tough and I am going to fight harder than I have ever fought, but I am looking forward to it. I have fought harder than ever to get to this point, so I just want to go in there and do everyone justice. There has always been a big support team around me but this time there has been hundreds of people really weighing in to help get me here.\"</p> <p>Radcliffe's last race was her victory in the New York marathon in November. It was another stirring, edge-of-the-seat performance when she held off the challenge of Gete Wami, her long-time Ethiopian rival. Wami will be back tomorrow, as will her team-mate Berhane Adere, the Kenyan world champion Catherine Ndereba, and Chunxiu Zhou, of China, who won the 2007 London marathon.</p> <p>The weather is the other opponent. Yesterday in Beijing was the clearest day since the Games began and there was not a hint of smog. Even with the race starting at 7.30am, four hours after Radcliffe's alarm call, it will be hot. But the type of rain seen over the past few days could work in her favour, and might even prompt her to charge away. The Briton has held the world record of 2hr 15min 25sec since 2003, but no Olympic women's marathon has been won quicker than when Naoko Takahashi of Japan, in Sydney, clocked 2:23:14. </p> <p>Radcliffe has been preparing at the British Olympic Association's camp in Macau, near Hong Kong, since the start of last week, but since May the majority of her training has been on a ski-machine or in the pool. She did not add up the miles she ran last week.</p> <p>\"I have generally adapted to the humidity,\" she says. \"If you are not in the race, you cannot win the race, but by getting myself to this point I have put myself in as good a position as I could have done. If I look back over the last 12 weeks, I don't think there was any point where I could have done any more.\" </p> <p>It should be fascinating and thrilling. No one knows if Radcliffe's leg will hold up, but she is such a fighter that victory cannot be ruled out, a result that would surely eclipse any other British gold at these Olympics. \"I am glad I pushed it at every opportunity, but in the time limit it was really hard and [just] having got this far gives me a mental lift going into the race,\" she says.</p> <p>\"It's important for me to go out there and run well, but I do not think it's the defining moment of my career. There have been other things in my career which will define it, hopefully there are other things I am going on to achieve.\" But they do not come bigger than the Olympic Games. If they did, you would not get up in the middle of the night to watch them.</p> <h2>Paula's highs and lows</h2> <p><strong>1992</strong></p> <p><strong>Junior champion</strong></p> <p>Radcliffe shows her potential when she wins the junior title at the world cross-country championships in Boston, but the foot injury that sidelines her throughout the 1994 season offers a warning of her frailty</p> <p><strong>1996</strong></p> <p><strong>A bigger stage</strong></p> <p>Makes her Olympic debut in Atlanta, coming fifth in the 5,000m.

Its official air pollution index stood at 17: the lowest since the games began.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Thousands of Mongolians celebrated yesterday after Tuvshinbayar Naidan won the country's first ever gold. Fireworks exploded above Ulan Bator after the judo triumph. In June, President Nambaryn Enkhbayar declared a state of emergency after protests over election results turned into violent riots. But after the win he shook hands with the chairman of the opposition Mongolian Democratic party and the two joined revellers in the city's central square.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Beijing aimed to teach 90,000 taxi drivers English as part of its pre-Olympic campaign to improve the welcome given to foreign visitors. But the drivers themselves acknowledge that language remains a stumbling block. \"We learned English: Beijing English,\" said one, in Chinese. \"Foreigners don't understand it - and neither do we.\"</p>",
  "<p>I've just been watching coverage of the Olympic dressage and I must say I'm absolutely baffled. In case you haven't seen it, let me explain what happens: people dressed in a sort of funereal version of fox-hunting gear take it in turns to go into a large sandy arena riding horses that seem to have been driven mad. The horses behave like the deranged dancing bears in those charity adverts, doing weird fidgety fastidious things that clearly aren't natural to them: they hop from foot to foot, they walk on the spot, they stand still for a bit, quivering, before turning round in awkward timorous circles and walking diagonally across the arena.</p> <p>Quite what treatment these creatures have been put through to get them to be this odd I dread to think, but it gets stranger: sometimes the horse and rider's obsessive antics are condemned by the commentators and judges as disappointing and sloppy, while behaviour no more or less insane is hailed as excellent and just the thing, and indeed quite the spectacle to behold. </p> <p>I wonder if any of these people saw the opening ceremony? For their sakes I hope not; if they find watching a horse getting the shakes in a sand-pit spectacular, the sight of those fireworks would have exploded their minds.</p> <p>Now I know there must be rules to dressage. It's not really just craziness arbitrarily scored, like a sort of tortured horse version of Mornington Crescent, but the fact that brilliance and incompetence are indistinguishable to all but the dressage cognoscenti does not speak well of the sport. </p> <p>I couldn't watch it for long without the question \"Why is doing this in any way good?\" springing to mind. I'm perfectly willing to admit that it must be very difficult to make horses do that, but what's the point?</p> <p>Obviously I'm straying into dangerous territory asking what's the point of a sport - you can argue that almost any leisure activity is pointless, but most sports involve at least something accomplished or exciting enough to make it clear why the activity is pursued. But with dressage, I'm not sure. I completely understand why it's good to make horses run fast or jump over things - but what is the satisfaction in this tuneless dance, this effortful yet unentertaining capering about?</p> <p>I must admit that my feelings against dressage are intensified by the fact that it's one of the sports that is scored by judges. I don't like that. I accept that some sort of judging is involved in all Olympic events - whether it's a referee in a hockey match or a line judge in the tennis - but the judging involved in gymnastics, diving and dressage is on a completely different level. They're not just deciding whether or not a goal has been scored, but what a goal actually is. The spectre of artistic impression hangs over them all in a way that makes me suspect that, skilful and worthwhile though gymnastics and diving may be, they should be put in the same category as dancing rather than the shot put: they're not, essentially, proper sports.</p> <p>A proper sport has a clearly defined aim: \"Get to that line first\", \"Throw that object the furthest\", \"Kick that round thing into that gap more times than them\". It doesn't matter how inelegantly these things are done, the winner is clear; indeed, as sports develop, what is effective in the achievement of the stated aim is what comes to look elegant.</p> <p>Sports that involve a judging panel have much fuzzier aims - a combination of electing to do difficult things while not being seen to have made any mistakes - and so you need several people's opinions to determine the extent to which the competitor has succeeded. If such subjectivity is permissible in determining victory or defeat, then why not open up the Olympics to ballroom dancing (after all, ice dancing is in the Winter Olympics), flower arranging or amateur dramatics? You might say that not all of those activities require peak physical fitness, but then neither do archery or shooting.</p> <p>The distinction between proper and judged sports is at its clearest when you compare ski jumping in the Winter Olympics with the long jump. In ski jumping points are determined by various factors including \"style\" whereas the long jump is entirely about how far you jump, no matter how much of a gangly fool you look while you do it.</p> <p>Surely the aim of ski jumping should be to jump as far or high as possible and then land safely? Why should style have anything to do with it if it doesn't help you jump further? If it was discovered that an airborne attempt at the hokey cokey added yards to the jump distance, surely that's what the jumpers should do - but they wouldn't because they'd lose points for style.</p> <p>Of course the scoring problem is less easily fixed when it comes to gymnastics and diving, and I'm not really saying that the Olympics would be better without them. The fact that they are Olympic sports encourages people to get involved. And, within those sports, there's undoubtedly a clear sense of what excellence is.</p> <p>But I'd nix the dressage in a heartbeat - and bring in snooker instead. It should be at least a couple of Olympiads before the Chinese and the Germans are better at that than us.</p>",
  "<p>If you want an idea of how China is watching its Games, forget the live venues. Only 40% of the tickets were available to the domestic public, with the other 60% kept back in order that various relatives of IOC dignitaries might shop, or take long lunches, or whatever it is they are doing that is keeping them from occupying the vast swaths of empty seats in every arena. </p> <p>Much better to settle down with a remote control and the fine state broadcast service that is China Central Television - somewhat unfortunately abbreviated to CCTV. How to give you a flavour of its news values? Yesterday two protesters, Philip Kirk and Nicole Rycroft, climbed up the back of one of the large Olympics billboards sited outside China's state television news headquarters - that breathtaking, Mobius strip-like glass structure in Beijing's financial district - and rappelled down the billboard's front after unrolling a vast \"Free Tibet\" banner. Police spent up to an hour getting them down, yet the incident was not referred to, much less shown, on any of CCTV's 18 channels. In fairness it is always difficult when a story breaks as far as two feet from your watercooler, so let us assume it was simply unable to get any reporters or cameramen outside in time.</p> <p>Then again it seems that every day is a good day to bury bad news here, what with CCTV having to meet its obligations to play the official Olympic song, Beijing Welcomes You, at least 987 times in any news cycle. </p> <p>Beijing Welcomes You comes complete with a video comparable to the BBC's Perfect Day promo, with 100 of China's best-known celebrities positioned either at famous cultural landmarks, or Olympic venues, or engaged in traditional crafts. Each of them sings a couple of the song's lines, every one of which seems to be \"Beijing welcomes you\".</p> <p>\"Beijing welcomes you!\" bellows Jackie Chan, flinging open his arms atop the Great Wall. \"We've opened up our world to you!\" Cut to a shot of Peking duck spinning round on a lazy Susan. \"Beijing welcomes you!\" sing a boyband, as if they have never meant a lyric more.</p> <p>In duration it is slightly longer than the sort of experimental album track a self-indulgent prog-rock band might lay down at their most narcotically addled. This lot have not welcomed you to Beijing until you are lying down and begging for mercy. Hear it twice and it will never leave your internal jukebox.</p> <p>It does, however, contrive to be less irksome than Beijing I Love You, which also comes around at least once an hour on every channel and features a torch-bearing singer accompanied by a cast of thousands. The lyrics are subtitled, presumably so the Chinese can join in the rapture from the comfort of their own sofa. Often one of these follows the other, giving the viewer a glimpse of what it would be like to pass eternity in China's most on-message choral society. </p> <p>But what of the sport? The thing that strikes you most is that the state broadcaster is interested in Olympics but not Olympians. Not for CCTV the looks at individual athletes' backstories which are commonplace to those who watch sport in the west. The focus is heavily Chinese, of course - but then all nations ladle on the patriotism at the Olympics. However, whereas Brits will by now know an awful lot more about Nicole Cooke than they did a fortnight ago, the Chinese are not presented with the athlete's journey to gold. It is as if the only narrative that matters is that of China's. Hence endless focus on the medal table.</p> <p>The approach would appear to tally with one of 21 edicts on Olympic coverage, issued by China's propaganda bureau, which decrees \"don't overhype gold medals\". Chinese athletes are celebrated but, typically, all together, in one giant Team China montage. </p> <p>That said, they certainly get the airtime. Hell, they even get the dead airtime and so it is that the camera will focus on a Chinese gymnast waiting minutes for a score to come up, ignoring the competition continuing elsewhere. </p> <p>Notably absent, too, are the slo-mo shots of athletes wiping out, those montages of noble failure that British broadcasters are given to setting to Cast's Walk Away - the official soundtrack of sporting disappointment. CCTV does only smiles and winners.</p> <p>And it is not a question of not having the space. CCTV has turned most of its channels over to the Olympics, meaning a channel like CCTV7, which is the military and agricultural channel, was yesterday showing Venus Williams' quarter-final defeat by China's Li Na. CCTV2, the business channel, was all over the fencing, though heaven forbid you would learn anything about the masked athletes. Breaks in the action were taken up with a CGI demonstration of the rules. Coming up next: women's weightlifting.</p> <p>Most aggressively relentless, though, are the adverts and the promos. CCTV's Olympic coverage makes half-time during a Champions League game on ITV look like an uninterrupted expanse of sport. A call to a local resident confirms that such high-production values and expensive international products are a marked contrast to some of CCTV's usual advertisers. </p> <p>Who are they? He says something about local wig-makers but it is a little difficult to hear, as those unmistakable opening chords can mean only one thing: Beijing is threatening to welcome me again.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Saturday 18 April 2009. We said that five protesters had abseiled down the China Central Television building in Beijing and had unfurled a banner, which said \"Free Tibet\" in Chinese and English. Two campaigners, Philip Kirk and Nicole Rycroft, climbed up the back of one of the large Olympics billboards sited outside China's state television news headquarters and rappelled down the billboard's front after unrolling the banner. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>In the anarchic world we politely term international relations, there was little surprising or unusual about the Russian aggressions into South Ossetia and Abkhazia. A great power was in a fierce quarrel with a small neighbour about that most commonplace cause of war - who should be boss when mixed ethnic groups claim the same lands and straddle international borders. Eventually the larger nation savagely spanked the smaller one, chiefly to impose its own solution on the problem but partly also to remind onlookers of that age-old truth: \"the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must\". Big boys still rule. </p> <p>Yet if there are no surprises, there certainly are many intriguing implications. As diplomatic historians well know, a relatively small incident in foreign affairs can have an importance well beyond the region in which the clash takes place - because of the responses of the larger powers, because it reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the available international machinery, and because it reminds us of the political realities and priorities of the age. Yet crises that seemed serious at the time - say, the Anglo-French confrontation over Fashoda in 1898 - have faded into the dustiest textbooks. A somewhat later crisis, such as Munich in 1938, is continually thrown up as a \"lesson\" for our present age.</p> <p>More often than not, a sudden confrontation can catch a great power in a state of some confusion. It would be fascinating, for instance, to know how the Chinese politburo is regarding the events in Ossetia. At present, clearly, its chief concern is the Olympics, and there must surely be irritation with both Georgia and Russia for pushing their quarrel into open shooting now. There must also be concern about revived Russian assertiveness and nationalism - although there is no fear in Beijing, for the Chinese know the canny Putin wouldn't push things against them: China is strong, and doesn't mind taking losses, so don't mess with it. More upsetting, Russia has breached that clause of the UN charter China holds most important of all: no interference in the internal affairs of a member nation.</p> <p>On the other hand, the Han Chinese cannot but like the idea of dissident ethnic minorities along a troublesome border being firmly spanked. Georgia's fate is not a matter of direct concern to Beijing. And Putin's roughing of Mikheil Saakashvili's government is a blow to American prestige and influence in Asia, always a congenial thought to China. So, while never, ever trusting the Russians, China can see that the Ossetian mess is nothing to get upset about.</p> <p>This is certainly not the feeling in Nato and the EU, or in the major capitals of Europe. Here, above all in France and Germany (Gordon Brown seems beset by his own regional difficulties, in Scotland), there is concern that Russian military actions and political toughness portend a fading away of the post-1991 \"new European order\" - that it is a sort of latter-day Rhineland crisis of 1936, heralding the end of Versailles treaty Europe. Friendship with Russia cannot wear the bullying and blackmail of western companies like BP, the attempted intimidation of Russian dissidents in the west, the re-entry of the KGB into foreign countries - in sum, the plain fact that Russia is not \"normal\". It is not Poland, it is not Hungary; it never knew the Enlightenment. </p> <p>And it is scary in other ways. First, Russia is terrifying to all those east European states that sought eagerly to flee the bear's grasp at the first opportunity following 1989 and 1991: to states, therefore, to whom Europe extended not only the economic and cultural ties of the EU but the security ties of Nato, with all its frightening implications. Right now, Georgia is not a Nato member, despite the Bush administration's urgings. This must be a cause for massive, nervous relief in Brussels and Washington. But what if a border dispute arises between Estonia (now in Nato) and Russia? Are the Portuguese and Danish armies prepared to march east? Are the Germans? Secondly, how will western and central Europe handle its heavy dependence on Russian natural gas, and its awful capacity for being blackmailed by Moscow? Things have come a long way since the wall crashed down in November 1989.</p> <p>As for the US, the possible implications of the last week are many and serious. Consider the challenge facing Washington: how on earth to make a coherent policy in response to a distant, fast-exploding ethno-linguistic conflict, contested borders, a risk-prone Georgian ally, an increasingly assertive Russia with a new energy trump card, a confused EU and a paralysed security council? All at a time when other areas of the world have sucked in US military resources, as if its own politicians were not already preoccupied enough by the nonsenses of presidential campaigning. We don't have the big stick. Moscow does, at least in this area of the world. You can only push western influence so far eastwards into Eurasia. Napoleon learned that, Hitler learned that: George Bush's time has come.</p> <p>This brings us to the larger geopolitical meaning of the Georgian scrap - namely, the measure of US power in today's fast-changing world. It could be better. It has been brought lower during the past eight years by inconsiderate and sometimes arrogant diplomacy, by an obsession with \"the war on terror\" and reckless fiscal policies. The post-1991 decade of the US's position as unchallenged number one - in Charles Krauthammer's memorable phrase, \"the unipolar moment\" - is over. To later historians, the pace of this shift will seem astounding. In the early 1990s, the elder George Bush, James Baker and other foreign policy veterans were wondering how to prevent Russia collapsing. Now the concern is about excessive Russian power.</p> <p>To other scholars, the Caucasian struggles may appear as a storm in a teacup. The real challenge to the US in the future - and perhaps to the west more generally - is the steady rise of Asia and, in particular, China. Putin's muscle-flexing against pesky small neighbours is a mischievous distraction. </p> <p>At the end of the day (but when is that?), it is probably Putin's hard-knuckled Russia that will be the loser. He may look tough and confident now, but his deck of cards is not so strong for the future. His strength rests on two supports: energy supplies and Russian nationalism. Those oil and natural-gas resources may evaporate sooner than he thinks. And Russian nationalism provokes enormous fear, enmity and resistance. Around the vast, open frontiers of the present Russian republic, and among the 100 ethnic minorities within the borders, no one loves the Russians. That has to be a geopolitical drag.</p> <p>So the Ossetian scrap is important, though it should not be exaggerated out of proportion. But it tells us a lot about our present, delicate, international system of states. We have interesting times ahead.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Paul Kennedy is Dilworth professor of history and director of international security studies at Yale University.

  "<p>Nigel Williams' Class Enemy was premiered at the Royal Court in 1978 and depicted life in a run-down, south London comprehensive where the children were out of control. When, at one lesson, the teacher fails to make an appearance, the boys take matters into their own hands and each takes it in turn to tell the other students about subjects ranging from instructions on how to make bread and butter pudding to one of the lads' experiences with his drunken father. East West Theatre Company now performs a version of the play which has transferred the action to contemporary, postwar Sarajevo.

  "<p>Appearing this time (mostly) without partner Ratchet, Clank graduates from comedy sidekick to leading robot. Sporting a Bond-style dinner suit and an increasing collection of gadgets, Clank's mission departs from previous outings in that shooting takes a back seat to that dreaded sapper of fun: stealth. Combat, when it does appear, is hampered by a too-closely-zoomed-in camera and weaponry that's just a bit too apologetic for its own good. Platform sections prove irritating, although generous continue points and the fundamentally mechanical nature of its challenges mean you rarely struggle for long. The levels played as Clank's little Gadgebots work nicely and when Ratchet does appear it's usually to do plenty of shooting, but you're left feeling this patchwork of a game does itself few favours by trying to mash in so many playing styles. And stealth: please, no more.</p>",
  "<p>Kate Atkinson threw her readers a curveball a few books back. Starting her career with a bang by winning the Whitbread Book of the Year for her first novel, Behind the Scenes at the Museum, Atkinson had seemed to set out a stall for smart, playful yet astringent novels in which the traditional family saga was cheerfully blown to pieces. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-454647739\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2015/1/15/1421328268739/When-Will-There-Be-Good-News.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Atkinson, When Will There Be Good News?\" width=\"140\" height=\"215\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Atkinson, When Will There Be Good News?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Behind the Scenes began, like Tristram Shandy, with the conception of its narrator, and then ploughed through the rest of her life with tremendous energy and subversive humour. Atkinson's next two novels, Human Croquet and especially Emotionally Weird, covered similar material (with some swipes at academia woven in) but were increasingly formally complex, and not always happily so. She began twisting her plots into ever more elaborate shapes and playing games with literary in-jokes, varying fonts and pages of blackness. Depending on how you chose to look at it, she was either breaking the rules of narrative in the grand tradition of Sterne or writing herself into a meta-fictional corner.</p> <p>And then came the switch. A Literary writer with a capital L (though one with a nicely disreputable sense of fun), Atkinson unexpectedly turned to crime fiction. Perhaps she wanted to see if the limitations of genre were paradoxically liberating, or perhaps she just wanted to play literary pranks of a more subtle variety. Frankly, it's hard to care when the results are this good. The three novels featuring retired police inspector Jackson Brodie - Case Histories, One Good Turn and now When Will There Be Good News? - are delightful evidence of an author unbound. Swiping a polished dagger through her Gordian knot, Atkinson began tackling life and death and fate and love with a freedom and fluency unseen in her earlier novels. By becoming a crime writer, she has - in a way that other \"literary\" types may wish to note - become a better literary writer than ever: funny, bracingly intelligent and delightfully prickly.</p> <p>When Will There Be Good News? opens with an act of shocking violence. Six-year-old Joanna is out walking with sister Jessica, baby brother Joseph and mother Gabrielle when they're suddenly attacked by Andrew Decker, a complete stranger. Joanna hides in the long grass and is saved, but her brother, sister and mother are stabbed to death.</p> <p>Thirty years later, Joanna is now Dr Joanna Hunter, a successful GP in Edinburgh with a baby, married to Neil, a local businessman. For a nanny, Joanna hires 16-year-old Reggie, whose mother has recently drowned on holiday and who is taking private tutoring for her Greek and Latin A-levels from terminally ill born-again Christian Ms MacDonald. Reggie has no experience with small children (\"What was there to know? They were small, they were helpless, they were confused, and Reggie could identify with all of that\"), but the fit is a comfortable one for both her and Dr Hunter, despite Reggie's need to keep drug-dealing brother Billy away from her working life.</p> <p>Brodie, meanwhile, is in Yorkshire, stealing a strand of hair from a two-year-old boy. At first we think he's investigating a kidnapping, but it turns out that the boy may be Jackson's own son; his mother is ex-girlfriend Julia from the previous novels, now estranged from Jackson and claiming he isn't the father. Hair in his possession, Jackson tries to return to his new home in London. This turns out to be surprisingly difficult.</p> <p>Back in Edinburgh, Detective Chief Inspector Louise Monroe, who nearly had a romantic connection with Brodie in One Good Turn, is now happily if surprisingly married to jolly orthopaedic surgeon Patrick (\"He was Irish, which always helped\"). Monroe is the one who has to alert Dr Hunter that Decker has served his full sentence and is about to be released. Coincidentally (in a book filled with them), she's back at the same house the next day, interviewing Neil Hunter, whose arcade has burned down in a suspicious fire.</p> <p>Events ramp up at considerable speed. There is a surprising train crash which, again coincidentally, happens in Ms MacDonald's backyard while Reggie is house-sitting. The train crash is, in fact, caused by Ms MacDonald losing control of her car, and Reggie rushes out into the night to look for survivors, saving the life of none other than Brodie, who really, really got on the wrong train. </p> <p>Reggie is also alarmed at the sudden disappearance of Dr Hunter, and pesters DCI Monroe to investigate, even though her husband swears she's only gone off to visit a sick aunt. Is this true? Has the reappearance of Decker caused her to flee? Or is there something even worse going on? </p> <p>Lovers of the crime genre have given Atkinson a hard time for her use of coincidence, and truth be told, the first half of When Will There Be Good News? can be a little hard to swallow. There are a lot of characters with similar backgrounds to keep track of, and they all keep running into each other in increasingly unlikely ways. There was even a point halfway through - when the ID of one character turned up in the pocket of another - when I groaned audibly. </p> <p>But if authors weren't allowed to use coincidence, then there'd be no EM Forster (there'd certainly be no Howards End). The ID issue is resolved, and you begin to see that Atkinson has larger issues in mind. By putting coincidence so firmly in control of her plot - all the way through to its very last page, where two protagonists are revealed to have an even deeper connection - she starts to raise larger questions of destiny and fate, much as Paul Thomas Anderson does in his great film Magnolia</p> <p>Both works acknowledge archly that we are participating in a work of fiction and that the rules are different here, but they're also working towards a greater truth than simple realism allows: how intertwined are we, as family, as lovers, as humans? How much are we governed by circumstances beyond our control? It is impossible, Atkinson argues, to take any action in a vacuum, to live your own life not completely bound up in the lives of others. \"A coincidence,\" Brodie says more than once, \"is just an explanation waiting to happen.\" </p> <p>Atkinson's writing continues to be wonderful. A group of 12-year-old girls is \"all fruity lipgloss and incredibly tedious secrets\". Young Joanna's father, a famous novelist, is \"'the Howard Mason' (or sometimes, not smiling, 'that Howard Mason', which was different although Joanna wasn't sure how)\". \"I have no idea how to love another human being,\" Louise Monroe says, \"unless it's by tearing them to pieces and eating them.\" </p> <p>The literary references are funnier, too, with chapter titles such as \"She Would Get the Flowers Herself\", or Monroe realising, in a lovely moment, that in her marriage she's \"the golden bowl\" and \"sooner or later the crack would show\". And Atkinson takes no prisoners as she heads towards a defiantly feel-bad ending, in which the noblest characters are capable of questionable actions and even the happiest are surrounded by unease.</p> <p>Kate Atkinson is that rarest of beasts, a genuinely surprising novelist. In the best possible way, I have no idea what she might write next. Only that I'll certainly want to read it.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Patrick Ness's The Knife of Never Letting Go is published by Walker Books.</p>",
  "<p>I had high hopes for the Mercedes Coupe. These hopes, it should be acknowledged, rested on nothing more tangible than the phrase \"Mercedes Coupe\". But in the car business, where armies of publicists are working full time to uncouple meaning from language, those two words still carry some convincingly romantic connotations.</p> <p>They seem to evoke evening jaunts along the Corniche of the C\u00f4te d'Azur, two lovers driving towards a golden sunset. In my mind's eye, I saw something sophisticated and sleek, urbane but not urban, cool rather than attention-seeking. If it was possible to drive a pair of words then I wanted to drive that sublime handful of syllables all the way to my destiny. And then they were delivered in vehicular form.</p> <p>\"Where is it?\" I asked the guy who came to my door.</p> <p>\"There,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Where?\"</p> <p>\"There.\"</p> <p>\"What,\" I asked, somewhat bemused, \"there?\"</p> <p>I was staring directly at the humdrum boot of a chunky-arsed hatchback. Mercedes describes the CLC, one of its \"C-class\" cars, as \"entry-level\" and, surveying its expansive backside, you realise that it's vital that the entry is front-on. This is not a car in which you'd want to have to make a memorable first impression in reverse gear.</p> <p>The only thing about the rear that says \"Mercedes\" is the famous badge. It's rather as if someone had prised it from a real Mercedes and, when no one was looking, stuck it on the back of a Fiat Brava.</p> <p>In fact, the CLC is an update - though not a noticeable one - on the Mercedes Sports Coupe. The company says that it's replaced or changed 1,100 components. Who even knew there were 1,100 components in any car? It seems an awful lot of effort to make a design seem so similar to its predecessor.</p> <p>If someone spent a fortune on plastic surgery and looked unchanged afterwards, we might wonder at their appreciation of aesthetics, not to mention economics. But in the car world things are different, which is to say the same is always different.</p> <p>Happily, the front, with its handsome signature grill, does look like a Merc. And that, after all, is surely the point. A large part of the reason for buying a Mercedes is because it is a \"Mercedes\". The whole idea of brands is that you're purchasing not just the design and engineering but also the status. So why pay for a brand name when it doesn't look like the brand? In fashion, designers got round that by introducing \"diffusion\" lines: essentially a pretentious description of cheap gear sold at inflated prices.</p> <p>On first drive, that was what I thought of the CLC. It seemed rudimentary and unresponsive, almost cumbersome. But after a period of readjustment, during which I banished thoughts of the fictional coupe on the Corniche, I began to enjoy its stripped-down style, exemplified by the simple, unfussy control panel. I even got used to the slightly awkward steering.</p> <p>There was something appealingly retro about the experience, vaguely reminiscent of a 1970s Ford Capri. That's probably not the image Mercedes was thinking of, though it may well be an improvement on a Fiat Brava. Does it, however, say Mercedes? In the manual, yes, but not, alas, in the imagination.</p> <h2>Mercedes-Benz CLC 200 CDI</h2> <p><strong>Price</strong> \u00a321,015<br><strong>Top speed</strong> 129mph<br><strong>Acceleration</strong> 0-62 in 11.3 seconds<br><strong>Average consumption</strong> 48.7mpg<br><strong>CO\u00b2 emissions</strong> 152g/km<br><strong>Eco rating</strong> 7/10<br><strong>At the wheel</strong> Dwain Chambers<br><strong>Bound for</strong> Ramsgate<br><strong>In a word</strong> Disappointing</p>",
  "<p><strong>Day 1: The trial begins</strong></p> <p>I'm running a little experiment - I'm stripping the whole problem of slugs and snails down to a few techniques based on an understanding of their habits. When it's dry, they don't like coming out. They're unlikely to bother plants in a veg patch free of weeds (where they hang out waiting to attack when it's wet enough). </p> <p>Rather than create a fortress round my plot, I'm leaving piles of cut comfrey at the edges as a diversion. Slugs and snails will congregate there like party-goers in a kitchen; then I can remove them easily. I've left a strip of bare soil a foot wide around the edge of my vegetable bed. This is a kind of no man's land along which frogs, toads and slowworms will pick off slugs if they do head towards the plot. I've also got my compost bin nearby and the slugs and snails love hanging out there.</p> <p>A few nights ago we had a very humid, wet night. I watched the slugs and snails eating the comfrey; one headed towards the veggie plot but seemed to get bored and turned back. This morning I found the edge of a leaf on one of my bean plants had been eaten. There was no damage to the hundreds of other seedlings. </p> <p><strong>Day 2: The drama continues</strong></p> <p>At the plot last night, the offending slug was back on my bean. Doesn't it know what it's supposed to do? Get with the programme, slugface.</p> <p><strong>Day 3: No more damage</strong></p> <p>What I really need to test my theory is a few wet nights in a row. </p> <p><strong>Day 4: More drama</strong></p> <p>Hit the sack at about 1.30am and couldn't sleep. Then I remembered I hadn't gone on slug patrol. I slipped back into my clothes and clambered up the slope to the garden. The piles of comfrey were alive with slugs and across the border, bingo, a toad. But there, back on the same bean, was a solitary slug. With a flick of the wrist it was propelled to safe quarters. </p> <p><strong>Day 6: No new developments</strong></p> <p>Another dry night. This is getting boring. Slugs keeping a low profile.</p> <p><strong>Day 8: The slugs in rain stay mainly on the comfrey</strong></p> <p>Last night it rained. I went up to the garden in some agitation but I had nothing to fear. The comfrey was fresh and the slugs and snails were crawling over it. Panning the torch across the vegetable beds, I found no slugs or snails at all. The comfrey method seems to be working.</p> <p><strong>Day 10: Nothing happened</strong></p> <p>There's no slug damage to report. I want some lone slug renegade to challenge my theory but they all seem to be happy eating the comfrey.</p> <p><strong>Day 14: Split splat</strong></p> <p>The Met Office has issued a severe weather warning for Snowdonia - the first prolonged wet test. This sort of experiment is not exact. To do it properly you'd have to have one experiment without comfrey, one using other techniques, a rainy year, a sunny year, a control bed. Who knows - the slug and snail numbers might have been kept down by the lack of moisture so far this year. </p> <p><strong>Day 17: Be careful what you wish for</strong></p> <p>I asked for rain. I asked for slugs. I asked for snails. I got them all. Last night was clear and cold; droplets of water clung to the tips of leaves like pearls pinned to a forest tapestry. Ah, the magic of the slug hunt. </p> <p>I didn't go up to the patch the night before and I paid the price. In the morning I found a slug walking away from two small, now even smaller, defoliated poppies. </p> <p><strong>Day 18: Quick update</strong></p> <p>Went up to the garden at 1am and removed 15 slugs and snails. The heavy rain has made conditions more hospitable for the slugs.</p> <p><strong>Day 20: I've made up a new word </strong></p> <p>Slugduggery: using one's guile against garden molluscs. I've been wondering what to call the underhand, unscrupulous but necessary pursuit of gastropods. Now I know. </p> <p><strong>Day 30: My slugs and other animals</strong></p> <p>The last couple of nights I've been having a poke around in the undergrowth and there are quite a few slugs mooching about. I've begun to feel self-conscious, going up to the plot with my torch. I'm probably mad.</p> <p><strong>Day 33: Things get serious</strong></p> <p>At this time of year, when you can hardly see the ground for foliage, the slugs and snails are more active; the comfrey is less good as a trap. What I really need is a bank of Wallace and Gromit-style infrared cameras, alarms and a catchy theme tune to hum whenever I go into action. Then the transformation into obsession would be complete. </p> <p><strong>Slug Watch: The end?</strong></p> <p>Will I be back next year, torch in one hand, sticky slug bucket in the other? Almost certainly, yes. Each time I go, I think of more questions. What if it had been wetter earlier in the year when my plants were more vulnerable? The irony is, it turns out I was looking for the wrong pest all along. The creature that has done the most damage this year was a mouse.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Go to <a href=\"http://www.allanshepherd.com\">allanshepherd.com</a> for more slug struggles.

  "<p>Bathrooms tend to go two ways: matching white units, or hotel-style wet rooms. But there is a third way - vintage. Quirky, and ecologically and economically sensible, the junk-shop look works well in the bathroom: think distressed walls wooden floors and an eclectic selection of freestanding furniture, accessories and industrial lighting. </p> <p>Look everywhere: secondhand shops, vintage and salvage specialists, high street stores (for reproductions). And be creative. \"Use coarse old linen as bath mats and wooden washing dollies as loo roll holders,\" says Sally Bailey, from vintage store Baileys Home And Garden. </p> <p>\"Many old fittings are better quality than new and will outlast them,\" says Thornton Kay, founder of salvage directory Salvo. \"And old kit will hold its price better: if you fit a \u00a35,000 new bathroom it will depreciate, whereas an old bathroom done well will go up in value. And reuse is very sensible - we throw away more sanitary ware now than ever before.\"</p> <p>There are downsides: vintage plumbing is often incompatible with modern systems and, while evidence of wear and tear is part of the look's appeal, you need to be sure you're looking at charming distress rather than actual damage. </p> <p>One way to avoid the pitfalls is to buy from a specialist dealer, who will refurbish pieces. Prices vary considerably but, according to Archie Mackie, bathroom manager of reclamation store Lassco, you should be prepared to pay more than \u00a31,000 for a restored vintage bath, basin or loo. Which isn't cheap (especially when you can pick up an unrestored kit for next to nothing) but skimping on the refit is a false economy. A vintage bath cheaply restored looks scruffy rather than chic and might leave you with expensive problems ranging from flaking enamel to leaks. </p> <p>Whichever look you go for, do your research first. We've put together a quick guide to get you started.</p> <h2>Eight-step plan</h2> <p><strong>1</strong> Start with the bath - it's the focal point of the room.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Plan ahead: with freestanding, mismatched furniture, make sure you have all the dimensions before work starts, so they can be incorporated into design plans early on. </p> <p><strong>3</strong> Antique earthenware and cast-iron baths are extremely heavy, especially when they're full of water, so make sure your ceilings can take the weight before making any purchase.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Ask whether or not vintage taps have been refurbished and tested. Unrestored taps may be cheap but it could you cost several hundred pounds to have them reconditioned before you can use them. And check they fit the holes in your basin or bath, and that the spout fits comfortably over the edge.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Don't forget that old sanitary ware doesn't come with manuals, so always employ a vintage-friendly plumber and before you start tell him/her that you're planning to use old fixtures and fittings. </p> <p><strong>6 </strong>Consider a wooden floor - if the boards aren't worth restoring, then paint them (try Farrow &amp; Ball's Hardwick White or Blue Gray floor paint, 01202 876141, <a href=\"http://www.farrow-ball.com\">farrow-ball.com</a>).</p> <p><strong>7</strong> Check for cracks and crazing. Crazed vitreous china is fine but steer clear of crazed earthenware and anything resembling a proper crack. </p> <p><strong>8</strong> Don't use acidic or citrus-based cleaning products on old enamelled bathware. Astonish, a putty-based cleaner, is a good alternative (\u00a31.50/500g tub, from Lakeland, 015394 88100, <a href=\"http://www.lakeland.co.uk\">lakeland.co.uk</a>).</p> <h2>Where to source Vintage</h2> <p><strong>Antique Bathrooms of Ivybridge</strong>, Devon, 01752 698250 (<a href=\"http://www.antiquebaths.com\">antiquebaths.com</a>).

  "<p>The government was yesterday accused of building a national DNA database by stealth after the Home Office admitted that it had kept DNA profiles of almost 40,000 children tested by police. </p> <p>Junior minister Meg Hillier said that profiles taken from 39,095 10- to 17-year-olds had been retained, although the individuals had not been cautioned or charged.</p> <p>By law, police can take DNA samples from anyone who is been arrested for a recordable offence. The profiles are permanently stored on the database, even if the person is acquitted. </p> <p>Hillier said figures from the National DNA Database (NDNAD) and Police National Computer (PNC) showed there were 349,934 DNA profiles relating to under-18s; the figure was equivalent to around 303,393 individuals because some profiles were replicated. Of those, 87.1% had a conviction, caution, reprimand or had received a final warning, she said. The remainder were innocent.</p> <p>Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said: \"These startling figures show that the government is building a national DNA database by stealth. There can be no excuse for storing the DNA of innocent adults, let alone children, who are entirely blameless.\"</p> <p>The Home Office argues that maintaining records of such people has helped solve crimes later. But last month a government-appointed advisory body said there should be a more straightforward system for innocent people to have their profiles removed. The Ethics Group said samples obtained by police should be destroyed at the end of an inquiry.</p> <p>Britain's DNA database is the largest in the world, with more than 4m samples.</p>",
  "<p>The Chelsea hotel, in New York. A hot day in summer. On the pavement outside, a grizzled blonde swills gin from a paper bag. In the lobby, a self-consciously hip young couple are having a domestic. At the front desk, a man with silvery hair stands with a pigeon on his shoulder. They are all regular guests.</p> <p>The Chelsea, a landmark on Manhattan's West 23rd Street, has for decades been a mecca for bohemians - poets, painters and punks who lived and died in its rooms. Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin all once called it home. Edie Sedgwick set fire to it. Sid Vicious was charged with stabbing his girlfriend to death in room 100. In short, it's not what most people would call a great environment for families. </p> <p>But try telling that to Joseph O'Neill, Sally Singer and their three children. O'Neill, an Irish writer whose new novel Netherland is hotly tipped to win this year's Man Booker prize, and Singer, a fashion journalist at Vogue, have set up an elegant, kitschy home in the hotel that describes itself as \"a rest stop for rare individuals\".</p> <p>Saturday morning breakfast at the O'Neills' is a chaotic affair. When I visit, we sit over takeaway coffee and croissants in the tiny retro-chic kitchen as a flurry of small, screaming boys dash around us. The cat, Lola, a tawny, green-eyed queen with a powder-puff tail, swishes in and out of the room. O'Neill, dressed in cricket gear for his weekly game, is gracious and chatty. </p> <p>\"They like the Chelsea,\" he says, referring to the children, because despite the sensationalised stories, \"There's a strong sense of community and it's one of the last fragments of a counter-cultural, unselfconscious place.\"</p> <p>Singer enjoys the perverse glamour of living in a hotel. \"I like that there are transients coming in every night,\" she says. \"I love the continual stream of people to look at. I don't want to live in my own closed-off space. People just drop by and knock on your door. I want to open my door and let the world in - and let my kids out.\"</p> <p>Their cosy, light-filled, three- bedroom suite, sparsely decorated with a mix of modern and antique pieces, seamlessly blends glamour and domesticity. In the living room, the white walls are filled with family photographs, while moody silkscreen images of Sid Vicious take pride of place above a curvy white sofa. </p> <p>The children have their own brightly wallpapered two-room suite - one room for sleeping and the other for playing. Tucked away beyond the playroom, stretching along the entire length of the wall, cubby-hole shelves sparkle with a vast clutter of women's shoes. (O'Neill reveals that \"Sally confessed only after we were together for a while that she was a fashion addict.\") </p> <p>The couple arrived in Manhattan in 1998, having emigrated from London with their two cats. \"Sally was offered a job at Elle,\" says O'Neill, \"so we crossed the ocean out of curiosity.\" He had no credit history and Singer, who is American, had virtually lost hers as a consequence of living abroad. So they ended up at the Chelsea with its bordello-like atmosphere, rock'n'roll ghosts and luminaries past and present. Since they have lived there, Deborah Harry, Ethan Hawke and the singer-songwriters Ryan Adams and Rufus Wainwright have taken up residence at various times.</p> <p>Previously little known, O'Neill, 44, is this year's sensation for his novel Netherland. Hailed as the \"King of New York\" by New York Magazine, he's been compared to an array of literary greats from F Scott Fitzgerald to VS Naipaul. The New York Times Book Review praised Netherland as \"the wittiest, angriest, most exacting and desolate work of fiction written about life in post 9/11 New York\". Much of his racy thriller is set in the Chelsea itself. The narrator, Dutch exile Hans van der Broek, adrift after his wife leaves him, observes that at the Chelsea, \"the furtiveness and ornamental diversity reminds him of the population of an aquarium he kept as a child\". </p> <p>For the O'Neill boys, too, the hotel is vivid and otherworldly, like the inside of a genie bottle, teeming with magical possibilities and exotic creatures. They race their bikes and skateboards along the white marble corridors past drag queens, mad old ladies, ageing rockers and men with angel wings and tiaras. For them, as their father says, every day is Halloween. Their mother thinks it's a good, stimulating environment for children.</p> <p>\"Come talk about why you live here,\" Singer asks her eight-year-old son, Malachy, as he shows his new comic book, one of a series that he wrote, coloured and stapled, scattered around the flat. </p> <p>\"Because I was born here,\" he snaps.</p> <p>\"What do you like about the hotel?\" she persists. </p> <p>\"I like the guy who lived in the bathroom.\"</p> <p>This gentleman, she explains, was \"squatting in the communal bathroom. They had to kick him out one morning and he went crazy.\" </p> <p>Does Malachy think any of the people are strange? \"Mrs Bolow. The woman who lies in bed all day,\" he says after a while. \"And the ghost who threw your platform shoe at me while I was sleeping.\" As for his younger brothers, they like living at the hotel \"because you get to climb stuff\". </p> <p>What do their family and friends think about bringing up children in a hotel? \"Most of our friends don't think it is strange,\" says O'Neill. \"I'm not sure how my parents feel. I imagine the Chelsea is not what they had in mind, but that it's no big deal. It's not as if we're living in a yurt.\" </p> <p>\"I know there are many people who wouldn't dream of bringing up their children in a hotel, where a large proportion of the people are checking in for the night,\" adds Singer. \"I know some people like to control the environment that children live in. They find comfort in predictability because the city is unexpected enough. But if you want to live in a sheltered world, where there's a doorman and no rogue element, you don't check into a hotel. What makes you persist, even when it doesn't make economic sense, is that people who live here deeply connect with it and don't think about things in a traditional way.\" </p> <p>Singer considers the hotel to be an eclectic, multi-generational village. \"There are grandparents whose grandchildren come and visit them and the teenagers next door, who we've known since they were kids, are our babysitters. There are other families in the building so the boys have friends here. They go to the local primary school and take part in the usual round of sleepovers, parties and adventures in the hallways. We also have eccentrics of every description and everyone tolerates it. There's that old-fashioned communal attitude here.\" </p> <p>O'Neill claims he's not one for nostalgia but \"the whole place is magic. But it's not a theme park. It's authentic, an organic village in the middle of the city, where the people are friendly and fascinating.\" It's also a place where you quickly learn to integrate the extraordinary into the everyday - the stream of fashion and film shoots and cocktail parties in the lobby. One of O'Neill's fondest memories is when he and Malachy, then a baby, were invited over for dinner by the late playwright Arnold Weinstein, who lived across the hall, and they ended up spending the evening with Arthur Miller, his photographer wife Inge Morath and friends. Their daughter, Rebecca Miller, the writer and filmmaker, was raised here for part of her childhood, in room 614, where Henri Cartier-Bresson sometimes read her bedtime stories and the Grateful Dead lived next door, smoking pot and having three-day-long parties with bus-loads of groupies.</p> <p>When Singer, 43, was growing up in Oakland, California, in the 1970s, \"with the surrealism of hippie culture, the violence of the Manson Family killings and the SLA [Symbionese Liberation Army] and Patty Hearst kidnapping happening in our backyard,\" she lost herself in fashion magazines. Seduced by the myths of Studio 54 and the Factory, she \"wanted to work for Warhol's Interview magazine and wrote him letters. I love that whole world - the beat Generation, Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso. I was absorbed by the fabulousness of it,\" she says. \"So it was inevitable that this is where I should live.\" </p> <p>\"Actually, it was my idea to come to the Chelsea,\" O'Neill says, throwing his wife a knowing glance. \"Sally made it happen. I had the outsider's sense of possibility.\" </p> <p>O'Neill met Singer in 1991 when she was his editor at the publisher Farrar, Straus and Giroux on his first book, This Is the Life, shortly after graduating in law from Cambridge. They lived in Stockwell, south London, and upgraded to Soho while he worked as a barrister, mainly defending death-row prisoners in the Commonwealth. She worked for the London Review of Books and later British Vogue. Moving to New York, they expected to stay briefly and rented a seventh-floor, one-bedroom apartment in the Chelsea, shifting to a bigger place upstairs when Malachy was born in 1999.</p> <p>After two more sons followed - Pascal, now seven, and Oscar, five - they left the hotel. \"You know, some people leave because of the mice, some because of the cockroaches and others because of the people in the elevator,\" says O'Neill. \"For us, it was sheer practicality. We thought our life had to assume a more adult size.\" So they bought \"an adult-size, eight-bedroom Victorian\" in Flatbush, one of the not-so-fashionable parts of Brooklyn, and spent months renovating it. </p> <p>O'Neill \"liked the light, the summer roses, the horse chestnuts\" and melting-pot neighbourhood. The boys and the cat enjoyed \"having a garden, lots of stairs and rooms to run and hide in. They loved the ice-cream truck that went down the street.\" But Singer was miserable and felt isolated from her Manhattan friends.</p> <p>\"I thought I was living the life that my parents hoped for,\" she says. \"but when I showed them the house they were disappointed. They're so used to coming to see me in seedy neighbourhoods with two rooms and a bed that pulls out of the wall. I know many English people think children need gardens, country houses to escape to. I don't want that. I think there's too much stuff in the world. You're not light on your feet and can't go at any moment.\"</p> <p>Within months, Singer was desperate to return. O'Neill reluctantly agreed. \"Well, you know,\" he sighs good-naturedly, \"if your wife says to you, 'I don't want to live here any more,' what are the options?\" After 18 months, they sold the house and returned to their old flat, knocking together an adjacent studio to create a three-bedroom apartment, for which they pay $5,000 (\u00a32,600) a month in rent. </p> <p>\"It surprised me how attached I am to the Chelsea,\" says Singer. I cried for days when we left. It's a village that I feel at home in. The residents feel they live in a sprawling extended house. We often have dinner with our neighbours. Last Thanksgiving, she \"made a feast for 30. We cooked here and moved upstairs to my friend Susan's for dinner. Then we went up to Gerald's top-floor apartment, which has a roof garden, for drinks.\" </p> <p>Some thrive on the buzz of communal living. Others come here to disappear. O'Neill and Singer are drawn by the diversity of the Chelsea hotel, which is like New York itself - dark, crumbling and colourful - a microcosm of Manhattan, where everyone has a story. </p> <p>\"These days, to rent and not buy is a radical act. We chose to rent this place instead of buying an apartment elsewhere and we don't have anything to show for it. A lot of people find that unacceptable,\" says O'Neill.</p> <p>But don't they love their life here? \"Yeah, exactly,\" he beams. \"How do you place a value on happiness? You'll never have a conversation about real estate in this hotel. And that's because the owner, Stanley Bard, has created this extraordinary community that reflects his whimsies and his peculiar, rather crazed priorities.\"</p> <p>They speak of Bard with warmth and frustration. He was ousted by his two partners last year after running the hotel for 50 years, helping many brilliant artists along the way. The change in management, stream of evictions and public disputes have left many residents worried that the Chelsea will be turned into just another boutique hotel. \"It's a fake war,\" O'Neill says philosophically. \"We just have to ride it out.\"</p> <p>In a world where imitation is celebrated, the Chelsea is a bulwark against conformity. As Arthur Miller wrote, \"This hotel does not belong to America. There are no vacuum cleaners, no rules and no shame.\"</p> <p>\"It's a grounding place and it defines my existence in New York,\" says Singer. She describes how Hiroya, a Japanese artist who paid his way through life with his paintings, left several works of art to the hotel before dying of a heroin overdose a few years ago. One of his paintings, which hangs between the seventh and eighth floors, has writing scrawled across it that translates as: \"From here, it's heaven.\" \"That's how we feel,\" she adds. \"I can't imagine living anywhere else.\"</p>",
  "<p>Newspaper coverage of the 2008 American election has been dominated by the rise of Barack Obama, but in the political literature published this summer the recurrent figure is, perhaps surprisingly, Richard M Nixon. The only American leader to have resigned is being remembered in non-fiction - Rick Perlstein's Nixonland - and fiction: invented characters interact with Tricky Dick in Ethan Canin's recent novel America America and, now, the new thriller by Stephen L Carter.</p> <p>A phrase from Perlstein's subtitle - The Fracturing of America - explains the reason for this sudden emphasis: these writers indict Nixon for the division of American politics into mutually uncomprehending tribes of left and right, and for the use of ruthless tactics in the conduct of campaigns and elections that saw off Al Gore and John Kerry, and may yet keep a white man in the White House for another four years.</p> <p>Carter is a law professor at Yale and his novels (the previous two were The Emperor of Ocean Park and New England White) take place in the overlap between the legal and political worlds, with particular attention to the African-American elite. His special subject is the black upper class, a section of American society generally ignored, for understandable reasons, by authors charting the poverty and racism that have been the more general experience of what Carter, through all his books, calls \"the darker nation\".</p> <p>Palace Council attributes this striking phrase to Eddie Wesley, a fictional young literary star whom the book places in the group of Negro (as the word then was) authors who gathered around Langston Hughes in the 1940s and 1950s. Hughes appears in the novel, as does Nixon, the span of the narrative stretching from his election to the vice-presidency in 1952, to President Ford's pardon for his disgraced predecessor in September 1974.</p> <p>In the time of Vice-President Nixon, after a smart party in Harlem to celebrate the engagement between the children of two members of the Negro \"aristocracy\", Wesley stumbles upon the dead body of a white lawyer, Phil Castle, a big Republican party fundraiser and adviser to President Eisenhower. Wesley is admitted to these circles both through literary success and through his connection via marriage to the Garlands, the first family of the darker nation, later generations of which feature in Carter's earlier novels.</p> <p>The dead man in Harlem is holding a cross in his hand and is soon established to have been part of a cabal that may be the underground government of America. These hints of a religious conspiracy are another example of the way in which almost all crime and thriller fiction now feels obliged to flutter its eyelids hopefully at the Da Vinci Code readership. The murdered lawyer, it turns out, has written a testament, a kind of alternative American constitution, which has mysteriously disappeared.</p> <p>But whereas Dan Brown used secrets and codes to dramatise fatuous impossibilities, Carter employs conspiratorial and paranoid plotting to highlight the reality of American political division: the Vietnam war, racial conflict and the rise of underground revolutionaries such as the Weathermen are all cleverly incorporated into the struggle between two competing visions of America which, as always in Carter's fiction, can not be neatly categorised as white and black.</p> <p>In another blessed distinction from Brown, Carter's prose is slow and methodical, full of well-researched detail such as the times and places where a black American could hope to be picked up by a cab-driver in the New York of the 1950s and 1960s. He is skilled at injecting pace and tension through canny use of foreshadowing: we know within a few pages that Eddie Wesley will ultimately \"help to topple a president\", while another character is introduced with the news that \"his murder was still 30 months away\".</p> <p>Even by the lax standards of the genre of faction, Palace Council has a slippery attitude to history: as the writer cheerfully confesses in an afterword, quite important events - the trial of the physicist J Robert Oppenheimer, and even Ford's pardon of Nixon - are nudged across the calendar to suit the story. This book, then, should not be read by dead-eyed pedants, but others will enjoy a historical thriller that efficiently delivers both thrills and history, especially in the still under-developed chronicles of black America.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mark Lawson's Enough is Enough is published by Picador.</p>",
  "<p>Many European cities are built around water, but in Stockholm there's more of it - everything is built on islands. There are a lot of pretty buildings - it's a bit like Prague, but not as grandiose. There's the same type of architecture, mainly 16th-18th century, plus little pockets of modernist building - most of the square houses you see were built in the 1930s and 40s. </p> <p>I live on a little island called Reimersholme which has no through traffic - it's one of the quietest places in Stockholm. I always like to live in areas that attract lots of retired people, because it's calm and relaxed. I've been here for about four years, but recently more young people have been moving in. The nearby Hornstull area is classically \"hip\", where you'll find a lot of the younger cool kids, cafes and stuff. So I live really close to that, but I live with retired people. Perfect!</p> <p>It's fantastic living in a city where you only have to travel 50m to take a swim. You can basically get into the water from anywhere. Just jump and you'll be in the sea! In summer everyone hangs about outside, in boats, with some wine and a book, or they go swimming. And then later on, we go get drunk in a bar. In late summer the water is warmer and the sunsets are particularly beautiful. </p> <h2>Where to eat</h2> <p>If you want to eat proper Swedish food you should go to a place called <strong>Prinsen</strong> (M\u00e4ster Samuelsgatan 4, <a href=\"http://www.restaurangprinsen.com/se/Index.php\">restaurangprinsen.com</a>, 0046 8 611 1331) and have the best Swedish meatballs on earth. Everyone claims their momma's meatballs are the best, but these are better than everybody's momma's. They are super delicious. There's some secret sauce thing going on. The best Italian food in town is at a place called<strong> Mancini</strong> (H\u00f6rnet Tunnelgatan 1/Luntmakargatan 12, <a href=\"http://www.mancini.nu/index.php\">mancini.nu</a>, +8 215 310), in a really, really super boring part of town - it's the only reason to go to that area but worth it. It's right by where the prime minister Olof Palme got shot in 1986. </p> <h2>Where to drink</h2> <p>My favourite bars are owned by a Polish guy called Jacob. One is called <strong>Indigo</strong> (G\u00f6tgatan 19, +8 643 5859) in S\u00f6ldermalm and the other is <strong>Babylon</strong> (Bj\u00f6rns Tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rds 4, +8 640 8083); the latter is outdoors so it's only open in the summer - it's a good place to people watch. Indigo is the year-round place. It's pretty small, but there's always good music, some pretty cool Polish food, and some super bizarre interior decorations. It was designed by a Spanish guy and has a crazy colour scheme with purple velvet and orange, all kind of kitsch. </p> <p>There's also a cool bar called <strong>Br\u00f6derna Olssons Garlic &amp; Shots </strong>(Folkungagatan 84, <a href=\"http://www.garlicandshots.com/\">garlicandshots.com</a>, +8 640 8446). They have one in London too [on Frith Street] but when I went to that one I noticed that it's mostly goths that hang out there. The one in Stockholm holds some great club nights. </p> <h2>Where to buy second-hand clothes</h2> <p><strong>Judits</strong> (Hornsgatan 75, <a href=\"http://www.judits.se/judits.html\">judits.se</a>) is a consignment shop with both men's and women's clothes. They're good, pretty selective. </p> <h2>Where to buy records</h2> <p>My local second-hand vinyl store, <strong>Mickes</strong> (L\u00e5ngholmsgatan 20) in Hornstull, has been there forever and stays open until whenever they feel like being there, sometimes 11pm - that's pretty neat because very few things in Stockholm are open late. And then there's <strong>Pet Sounds</strong> (Sk\u00e5negatan 53) in S\u00f6dermalm. While most record stores are dying or down-scaling, they've just made theirs a lot bigger - three times as big as it used to be. And that has to be good. You can actually ask the staff what's worth trying and they'll have a good opinion on it. They also do special orders. </p> <h2>Where to see gigs</h2> <p>The classic place to see bands is <strong>Debaser</strong> (Karl Johans Torgatan 1, +8 305 620, <a href=\"http://www.debaser.nu\">debaser.nu</a>). There are two now, but the one by the water, the original, is the best. It only holds 300-400 people. The other (Medborgarplatsen 8, +8 694 1900) holds 800-900 people. Also, two brothers, who run a magazine and label called Savage (<a href=\"http://www.savage.se\">savage.se</a>), put on \"secret\" punk shows on a boat called <strong>Vieille Montagne</strong>.

  "<p>Haji Juma Khan leads something of a charmed existence. A towering tribesman from Afghanistan's border badlands, Khan uses the title \"Haji\" because he has completed the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, Islam's holiest shrine. But piety is not his sole concern: he is also one of about 20 men who run Afghanistan's \u00a32bn heroin trade. Business is good. Last year the country's fields of pretty pink poppies produced a record harvest, sending drug production soaring to new heights, funding the Taliban and thrusting Afghanistan into ever greater chaos. And despite the best efforts of western counter-narcotics specialists - who have spent six years and more than \u00a31.7bn in fighting the heroin trade - Khan is free as a bird. </p> <p>His empire is centred on Baramcha, a scruffy town in the Chagai Hills on the Pakistani border. Khan, an ethnic Baluch, seized control of this parched area in the dying days of Taliban rule in late 2001 and turned it into a bustling hub of smuggling and gun running. It is dotted with heroin labs: rough shacks where turbaned men, tutored by imported chemists from Iran and elsewhere, use chemicals and vats of boiling water to refine bars of sticky brown opium into bags of powdery white or brown heroin. The drug departs on convoys of high-speed jeeps, bristling with weaponry, that dash across the desert towards the Iranian border. It is then sold to criminal gangs who push the heroin to its end customers: addicts in Europe and Russia. </p> <p>The town is also a springboard for Taliban attacks. Insurgents pass through training camps and madrasas in the town on their way north into Helmand, where 8,000 British troops are based. Opium flows in the opposite direction. The vast, unruly province provides Khan with a bountiful supply of raw drugs. Last year Helmand produced 53% of the Afghan poppy crop, making it the world's single greatest source of illicit drugs, producing more than Colombia, Mexico and Burma combined. Impressive for a province with just 2.5 million people. </p> <p>Khan makes the law in Baramcha and brooks no dissent. The last time the provincial government dispatched a team of border police to the town, three years ago, 11 officers were captured and reportedly beheaded. More recently, Khan's operations have been raided by Commando Force 333, an Afghan paramilitary unit trained by the (British) Special Boat Service. Afghan soldiers swoop in armoured helicopters, forcing their way into the drug labs and arresting whomever they find. Their British mentors usually come, too. The latest raid on Baramcha, in June, netted five tonnes of opium; 13 smugglers, including four Iranians, were arrested. </p> <p>Commando Force 333, operating under great secrecy from a fort south of Kabul, is considered a success in the war on drugs. But it has never come close to Khan. He is more likely to be found in the port cities of the United Arab Emirates - Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah - where, money-laundering experts say, much of Afghanistan's dirty cash ultimately ends up. Khan has snapped up property and a small fleet of cargo ships, based in Sharjah, which according to reports he has used for smuggling heroin out of Pakistan. His wealth is conservatively estimated in the tens of millions of pounds - money that may also be funding bloodshed: counter-narcotics officials have evidence of a meeting between Khan and insurgents including senior Taliban figures and lieutenants of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, an al-Qaida sympathiser fighting US forces in Afghanistan's mountainous east. </p> <p>The Taliban appears to have lost its aversion to drugs since 2001, when the black-turbaned fighters banned the poppy crop at gunpoint. Now they tax farmers who grow poppies at a rate of 10% and, in some places, protect drug-smuggling convoys, also for a slice of the profits. This lucrative sideline earns the fighters at least \u00a350m a year, according to the UN; others put the figure higher. Men such as Khan are key to their success. </p> <p>The world's leading counter-narcotics agencies - America's Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Britain's Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) - are trying to keep tabs on him from their Kabul embassies. Yet they cannot lay a glove on him. Instead Khan flits with ease between the UAE, Baramcha, Quetta in western Pakistan, and Kabul. \"He's everywhere, just doing his thing,\" one official admits. </p> <p>Ironically, the authorities once had him in their grasp. In late 2001 US soldiers picked up an elderly, pious-looking Baluch tribesman near the southern city of Kandahar. They identified him as Khan, Time magazine later reported, but their objective was Osama bin Laden and the Taliban leader Mullah Omar. Border rogues were low on their list of priorities. And so the soldiers let him go. </p> <p>It was a costly error. In the years since, it has become clear that the fight to save Afghanistan - from the Taliban and from debilitating corruption - is unlikely to be won without getting the better of men such as Khan. </p> <p>The project of rebuilding Afghanistan, so heartily promised by President Bush after his troops invaded in 2001, is in grave peril. The country is in terrible shape. A resurgent Taliban has swept the southern and eastern provinces, destabilising the countryside and knocking at the gates of Kabul. Britain has so far lost 114 soldiers; the past two months were the deadliest ever for American troops there. The other, less visible, threat is equally ominous. Drug-related corruption has infected every level of government, crippling governance programmes and dangerously undermining Afghan leaders in the eyes of their own people. Policemen, parliamentarians, governors and probably several ministers are on the drug networks' payroll. President Hamid Karzai has been forced repeatedly to deny allegations that members of his own family are involved. Among western allies, patience is fraying. Thomas Schweich, a former senior US official, launched a scathing attack on Karzai last month, accusing him of sheltering the drug lords. \"He was playing us like a fiddle,\" he wrote in the New York Times. </p> <p>The war on drugs is about much more than money. In other countries drugs are a criminal activity driven by greed. In Afghanistan, battered by three decades of conflict, they are a tool of political power. \"Afghanistan isn't like anything anyone has worked on before from a drug perspective,\" says Doug Wankel, a veteran counter-narcotics officer. \"This is not Burma or Thailand or Mexico or Colombia. This is a fledgling nation that is just starting to stand up again after 30 years of disarray and destruction. It's so fragile, and corruption is such an issue, that this whole drug thing can play into the other ills of the country, destroying this government and pushing the nation into big-time civil disorder. Why? Because you have so many people who can get so many weapons. It's entirely different, I'm telling you.\"</p> <p>Wankel, a 62-year-old American, has long experience of Afghanistan's drug wars. His career began in 1970 when, as a Missouri law student, he saw a TV ad for the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, predecessor of the DEA. \"I'm sitting there thinking James Bond and women and adventure. So I called the toll-free number,\" he recalls. They sent him to Detroit, then the murder capital of America, where his job was to buy drugs: cocaine and PCP (phencyclidine) in well-to-do white neighbourhoods and heroin in the run-down black areas. Wankel, skinny as a rake, passed for a junkie. The experience blew his mind. \"You remember Shaft?\" he says. \"You actually had these guys on the streets, wearing their big-brimmed hats and fancy long coats, and driving those pimpmobiles with the white walls. It was amazing, just like you see on TV.\"</p> <p>Eight years later, seeking a fresh adventure, the young DEA officer had himself transferred to Kabul. It was a pivotal moment. Three months on, the dictator Muhammad Daud was overthrown in a communist coup. At the end of the following year, in December 1979, 100,000 Soviet troops rolled in. The Red Army occupation triggered a bloody 10-year war between the Soviets and CIA-funded fighters known as the mujahideen. The jihad, as they called it, also marked the start of the heroin era. For 150 years Afghan farmers had grown small amounts of poppy, mostly in Badakhshan province in the north. After jihad erupted, the business got serious. Shinwari tribesmen in eastern Nangarhar and their tribal cousins, the Afridis in Pakistan's Khyber Agency, started to process opium into heroin (10kg of opium makes about 1kg of heroin). Profits multiplied, and by the mid 1980s Afghanistan was supplying one third of the world's heroin. </p> <p>By then Wankel had left - the Soviets had accused him of spying - and moved on to operations in Pakistan, Colombia and Peru, rising to the number three position in the DEA. In 2004 he was called back to Afghanistan to coordinate counter-narcotics policy, and now works as a private consultant. He is frustrated at how the west has mishandled the drugs war. \"From the beginning the military thought they could do security and leave narcotics and corruption for later. They were wrong,\" he says. \"There's got to be a comprehensive strategy that also involves rule of law, corruption and drugs. Otherwise you can forget it.\"</p> <p>The more the west has poured money into fighting drugs in Afghanistan, the more heroin has poured out of the country. Since 2002 the UK, which coordinates the international effort, has spent \u00a3262m on training soldiers, police, investigators and judges, and building a new drugs court. The US has given \u00a31bn. In addition the two countries have blown a total of \u00a3420m on \"alternative livelihoods\" - rural development projects to persuade poppy farmers to switch crops. Over the same period the poppy crop has exploded, hitting a record high of 193,000 hectares last year - enough to carpet Greater London and the Isle of Wight. (This year's crop figures are due later this month.) Nor is all of this produce exported: driven by much misery and an abundance of cheap heroin, Afghanistan's own addict population is rising fast. The last survey, three years ago, recorded 920,000 users; the number is almost certainly higher now, a flood of drug-using refugees having since returned from Pakistan and Iran. </p> <p>These failures have caused bewilderment and a bad-tempered debate about how to combat drug production in Afghanistan. None of those involved - Karzai, western diplomats, Nato generals, many self-styled counter-narcotics experts - seems able to agree on the answer. The Senlis Council, a pugnacious NGO, favours legalising the poppy crop. Others, chiefly in America, press for wholesale destruction. Last year the US spent \u00a388m on an eradication programme run by DynCorp, a company that employs many retired American special forces soldiers. Over the harvesting season, DynCorp led hundreds of Afghan workers through the fields of Helmand and Uruzgan, thrashing down poppies with tractors and sticks. Fired at by angry farmers and opportunistic insurgents, and obstructed by bent local officials, the eradicators managed to destroy just 3,000 hectares. This seemed a bad deal. It would have been 10 times cheaper - and less bloody, since three eradicators were shot - to have simply bought the farmers' opium. But that solution doesn't work, either, as the British discovered five years ago when a buy-back scheme collapsed after officials realised it simply encouraged farmers to grow more poppies the next year. They turned up at the Kabul embassy demanding payment from embarrassed British officials. In diplomatic circles, the episode has been politely forgotten.</p> <p>The other big idea is aerial spraying. The US favours dispatching armoured crop-duster planes loaded with the weedkiller Roundup to spray the poppy fields; British and Afghan officials are opposed to the idea, saying it would enrage already hostile farmers. The US ambassador William Wood, who was formerly posted to Colombia, has tried to convince Afghan officials worried about the safety implications of the herbicide, saying he would even take a shower in it. A British official retorted: \"It's Roundup. My dad puts it on his weeds. It doesn't mean he uses it for his tea or to bathe in.\" </p> <p>But the focus on farmers, who are often poor and indebted, seems unfair. According to the UN, the average southern poppy farmer made \u00a31,658 from last year's harvest. That's about one third more than he would have earned growing wheat, enough to clothe his children and send them to the local school - assuming the Taliban hadn't torched it. By contrast, the 20 top traffickers pulled in profits of \u00a31.5bn. It's time to switch focus, says Christina Oguz, head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in Kabul. \"We are looking too much at cultivation and not enough at the top of the drug networks,\" she says.</p> <p>A 96-cell high security jail for high-level drug traffickers has been built, with \u00a31.1m of British money; it was handed over to the Afghan justice ministry last June. As no drug lords have been captured, however, it is likely to be filled with Taliban commanders. The heads of the drug networks, meanwhile, live freely, openly flaunting their great wealth. A raid by DEA agents on the home of a major trafficker in Nangarhar last November gives a sense of the sums involved: meticulously kept account books detailed heroin shipments worth \u00a381m over a nine-month period. In a broken, poverty-stricken country such as Afghanistan, these gangsters' main difficulty is spending the money. Status demands a few essentials. A fleet of Lexus Land Cruisers - hulking 4x4s with tinted windows, video entertainment systems and usually no licence plate - is de rigueur, as are gangly mansions in Sherpur, a new Kabul neighbourhood known for \"narcotecture\" - a gaudy style with sweeping balustrades, wedding-cake plasterwork and blue mirrored windows. The label may be unfair - some Sherpur residents surely earn their money honestly - but in a country in which drugs account for one third of gross domestic product, and the competing exports are carpets, fruit and nuts, many Afghans have a different idea. \"The owners are the ones who killed our people and drank our blood,\" construction worker Hussain told me three years ago outside a mansion he was building. \"But at least it is providing us with work.\"</p> <p>Most of the drug loot goes abroad. \"There are a lot of wealthy people in Afghanistan but the money is not here,\" says Nick Lockwood, a former drugs adviser at the British embassy. \"It's in Dubai.\" Traffickers wire their profits to the UAE using hawala, the age-old informal money transfer system that is cheap, fast and, best of all, leaves no paper trail. When it lands there are few questions asked: along with the Russian mob and Colombian cartels, Afghan drug lords are among Dubai's big investors.</p> <p>One \"big fish\", as Afghans call them, has been netted - in rare circumstances. In 2005, American agents lured Haji Bashir Noorzai, leader of a major smuggling clan in Kandahar, to New York. Noorzai thought he was there to curry favour with the Americans by providing intelligence on the Taliban. He was put up in a smart Manhattan hotel not far from the site of the destroyed Twin Towers, and interrogated, in a friendly way, for more than a week. But on the 13th day, the agents clapped him in handcuffs and brought him before a judge. The DEA later described him as the \"Pablo Escobar of Afghanistan\"; Noorzai's lawyer says he was a victim of entrapment. His trial is due to start shortly. </p> <p>That ruse is unlikely to work a second time. So the latest western scheme is to improve - in fact, build from scratch - Afghanistan's own justice system. It is a gargantuan task. The necessary institutions are rotten: the police are poorly trained and corrupt; so are the judges. Most honest, educated officials have fled the country. In the rare instances when Afghan courts have sent major drug traffickers to jail, they have almost invariably been released within weeks - on the orders of senior government officials. Oguz of the UNODC calls this \"telephone justice\".</p> <p>Undaunted, Britain and America are training the police. A dedicated counter-narcotics force has been set up; Soca and DEA agents are currently teaching a new \"special investigations unit\" the arts of phone-tapping, running informers and gathering evidence. Recruits to this force must pass lie detector and urine analysis tests, and not all make it: drug addiction levels among police are said to be extremely high.</p> <p>In an effort to evade Afghanistan's flawed courts, these donors have set up a special drugs court on the edge of Kabul. Western lawyers train its prosecutors. Judges are paid 10 times more than the going rate in the hope of keeping them honest. This appears to be working: last year the court scored 278 convictions, up from 182 in 2006. Sentences are stiff, with a minimum jail term of 10 years. Yet this system is not perfect: prosecutors are markedly better funded and prepared than defence briefs. \"It's very questionable,\" Oguz says. \"Getting evidence is not just about putting the big guys in, it's about making sure innocent people are not in prison.\" And none of those big guys has appeared before this court. </p> <p>The big problem, in almost every counter-narcotics scheme, is corruption. Allegations of covert drug trafficking swirl around many of the leading Afghan officials in the key ministries. Some may be explained as malicious gossip; others are based on hard evidence. One afternoon I visited General Kamal Sadat, who until last year headed the counter-narcotics police. Now, after failing a Soca lie detector test, he is unemployed. British officials asked if he had ever taken a bribe and, he told me angrily, \"I told them the truth.\" But instead of blaming the British, Sadat attributed his downfall to the machinations of his rival - and former colleague - General Muhammad Daud, the deputy interior minister for counter-narcotics. \"It was just a way for him to get me out,\" he spat. </p> <p>Daud is certainly a controversial figure. A former militia leader under the warlord Ahmed Shah Masood, he is a personable man with a taste for dapper suits. Investigations by the Los Angeles Times and other papers have linked the minister and his family to narcotics. Last year one of his senior aides was sentenced to 12 years for trying to sell drugs confiscated by the police. Daud, who harbours ambitions for higher political office, brushes the charges off with a laugh. But two years ago the British took them so seriously, they tried to have him fired; he survived thanks to support from Karzai and the US embassy. Now the British have learned to live with him: in June, Daud visited London on a police training course. </p> <p>Counter-narcotics officials acknowledge that they must work with people who are modestly - or \"acceptably\" - corrupt. After 30 years of war, few Afghan politicians have a clean slate, Wankel says. \"None of us would be able to survive under the circumstances these people have been through in the past 30 years. They obviously did what they had to do. Americans want to think black and white. But you gotta throw that out the window when you come to Afghanistan. Everything here is a shade of grey.\" </p> <p>There's less moral wiggle room for President Karzai. With an election looming next year, he stands accused of going slow on the drugs war to avoid annoying powerful supporters. How things change: in 2004 I attended a conference in the heavily-guarded presidential palace where Karzai declared a \"jihad\" on drugs. Foreign counter-narcotics officials now deride this as a bad joke. The president has not even made symbolic sacrifices: many point to the fact that his anti-corruption tsar, Izzatullah Wasifi, is a convicted drug dealer who served nearly four years in a US jail after being caught selling heroin in a Las Vegas hotel. \"I was a youngster,\" Wasifi told me with a shrug. More troubling allegations centre on Karzai's younger half-brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, head of the Kandahar provincial council and reputed to be involved in the drugs trade. \"This is really a lot of rubbish,\" Karzai told Der Spiegel in June. \"I have thoroughly investigated all these accusations, and of course none of them are true.\" But the rumours persist.</p> <p>Karzai's relations with the British are strained. In early 2006, under pressure from Britain, Karzai dismissed Sher Muhammad Akhunzada, the long-standing governor of Helmand province and an alleged drug smuggler. The evidence was persuasive: in a raid on the governor's office a few months earlier, DEA officials had found nine tonnes of opium in the basement. (Akhunzada claimed he'd seized the consignment from a smuggler and was about to turn it over to the police.) The head of the DEA, Karen Tandy, later testified to America's Congress that this was the largest stash her agents had seized in Afghanistan. But Karzai, who has family ties with Akhunzada stretching back to the mujahideen war, did not punish him. Instead he rewarded the ex-governor with a seat in the upper house of Afghanistan's parliament. </p> <p>In April I went to see Senator Akhunzada at his Kabul house. For an alleged druglord, it was disappointingly sparse. Sure, a black Land Cruiser was parked in the driveway, but the carpets were mangy and soiled, the ceiling was blotched with damp and the television was an old-fashioned cathode ray tube model - not even a plasma screen. Gently stroking his beard and puffing on a Marlboro Light, Akhunzada lamented the worsening insurgency in his home province. \"Every day more killing and injuries,\" he said, shaking his head. \"Another attack on a police station today. Seven dead.\" In his view, he alone could end the violence. \"If only the British would listen, I could help,\" he sighed, \"but we do not have good relations. If I was governor, the Taliban would not have captured even five inches of land. Now they have five districts.\" He may be right that he could bring change - British officials believe his powerful militia is still running drugs. </p> <p>In a farewell act of chutzpah, Akhunzada handed me a sheaf of paper with his own prescriptions for the drug crisis. It was titled \"Preventation [sic] of poppy cultivation\". The fourth point read: \"The government should make one exact list of smugglers.\" </p> <p>For one such smuggler, Haji Juma Khan, these are interesting times. The Baluch from Baramcha is trying to go legit. According to several officials, Khan has made the government an offer: in return for an amnesty, he will quit the drugs business and invest his money in Afghanistan. \"Think of The Godfather Part III,\" says one source, referring to the movie in which Al Pacino's Michael Corleone tries to go straight. In the film it all goes wrong for Corleone. He ends up a lonely and broken man, slouched on the balcony of a Sicilian villa. The final act of Khan's career, however, has yet to be written.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Wednesday June 4: The Clifton pub, St John's Wood, London</strong></p> <p>I find Rhys Ifans and Dafydd \"Daf\" Ieuan hiding behind their sunglasses in a London pub's beer garden, working their way through some bottles of cider. Would Ifans like some crisps or anything? \"Oh no,\" he replies quickly. \"No, no. No solids.\" The Welsh pair - not shy about their enjoyment of drink or drugs - are here to talk about the band they've formed with eight sometime musicians, mostly from Cardiff. They are called The Peth, which means \"thing\" in Welsh. It is also in-band slang for cocaine. </p> <p>Ieuan's normal source of employment is as the drummer in Super Furry Animals. Ifans is an actor, the scruffily charismatic star of Notting Hill and Enduring Love. They're a bit fuzzy on exactly how long they've known each other, but they think it's around 25 years, their friendship dating back to a Cardiff flat-share in the very early days of the Super Furry Animals, and a good few years before Ifans made his big-screen debut in 1997's Twin Town, a film routinely described as \"the Welsh Trainspotting\". </p> <p>\"I was kind of homeless at the time,\" says Ifans, \"so Daf offered that I sleep in his studio.\" Briefly, Ifans sang with an embryonic incarnation of the Super Furries, and they attempted to record some demos. \"But we passed out, didn't we?\" recalls Ieuan. \"And we had to stop recording.\"</p> <p>Ieuan went on to make eight studio albums with the Welsh indie-psychedelic band; Ifans has just finished shooting the latest film from Richard Curtis, The Boat That Rocked, about British pirate radio. After The Peth's autumn tour he's playing the title role in an adaptation of Welsh drug-smuggler Howard Marks's bestselling autobiography Mr Nice. \"There's gonna be a lot of dope smoking,\" the actor says with a grin. \"That's gonna stretch me!\"</p> <p>But, through the years, their friendship remained firm. When Ieuan began writing songs for an album, a collection called The Golden Mile that hymns the praises of a stretch of Cardiff road where you can buy all your store-cupboard staples (\"Food, beer, plectrums, strings, drugs, whatever\"), he decided to ask Ifans if he'd like to sing them. Who better to front a set of beery but tuneful songs that evoke the best bits of Oasis, Happy Mondays and the Super Furries than the man commonly referred to as \"Britain's most rock'n'roll actor\"? The album's lead single says it all. It's called Let's Go Fucking Mental.</p> <p>Which brings us to the other reason Ifans is hiding out at the back of a quiet pub this afternoon. The off-duty behaviour - boozing, partying, gobbing at the paparazzi - of this fully paid-up member of the Primrose Hill set often propels him into the pages of the tabloids. But Ifans' value to the red-tops has rocketed since he began going out with Sienna Miller in mid-2007. And since they split up, it's zoomed higher still. With unfortunate timing, the news that Miller, 26, reportedly dumped Ifans, 40, by telephone has appeared in The Sun this very morning. She, it is said, caught him going through her texts; he, apparently, was suspicious of her friendship with Matthew Rhys, her co-star in The Edge Of Love; she, allegedly, couldn't cope with his jealousy.</p> <p>Mucky and deeply personal stuff for sure, and it goes some way to explaining Ifans' wobbly demeanour and slurred diction, if not the fact that he's turned up to the interview without any shoes. </p> <p><strong>Wednesday July 2: Portmeirion Town Hall, Portmeirion, Wales </strong></p> <p>We are in Sir Clough Williams-Ellis's model village. The Peth are playing their first-ever gig in the town hall, the opening leg of a five-date tour of the Welsh hinterlands. In the foyer the merchandise stall is selling T-shirts that say \"Pwy Ffwc Di'r Peth?\" (\"Who The Fuck Are The Peth?\").</p> <p>Underneath a vaulted 17th-century ceiling depicting the labours of Hercules, the band pile through their 50-minute set. Ifan clutches a can of Fosters and hangs on to the microphone stand for dear life. Behind the singers, Ieuan plays a Fender Telecaster; it's the first time he's played guitar in public. He, like Ifans, is wearing shades. A couple of the musicians he's recruited appear to be playing little more than their knees. For Last Man Standing, The Peth are joined by an eleventh musician, on banjo. They sing Let's Go Fucking Mental, which they describe as a \"beer chucker\" anthem, with Ifans screaming the word \"mental!\" 27 times as the song clatters to a halt. All told, it should be a disaster. In fact, it's brilliant. Like the Happy Mondays, the band have a shambolic magnetism, the sheer strength of their tunes providing a centre of gravity in all the chaos.</p> <p>In the pub in London I had asked Ifans about the lyrics to Last Man Standing, which, melody-wise, is a breezy pop song: \"If I only had my crack pipe it just might have kept me sane\", it begins, \"instead of picking up the toaster and toasting half my brain.\" Can he remember how those lyrics came up?</p> <p>\"Uh, I can, yeah...\" begins Ifans. \"It was during the time when I was hanging out with Pete Doh...\" He stops and scratches his Worzel Gummidge hair. \"It was... It came...\"</p> <p>Was it inspired by the environment you were in at the time?</p> <p>\"No, it was inspired by the cult...\" He tails off again.</p> <p>The cult of Pete Doherty?</p> <p>\"No, the cult, the culture of that time... That whole obsession with... The crack pipe has never kept anyone sane. There's a lot of stuff in there that is very raw, lyrically. And there's a lot of stuff that is just complete and utter situationist mischief.\"</p> <p>What category does that line fall into?</p> <p>\"Em...\" Ifans pauses. \"Mischief,\" he says finally, twice. \"We had this debate when we were writing lyrics: are we swearing too much? Not because we think swearing is wrong, but is it lazy?\" In the end, The Peth's attitude to lyrics can be summed up as \"Oh, just keep it in. We're not Radiohead,\" says Ifans with his lazy, vulpine smile. \"We're not poets.\"</p> <p>The day after Portmeirion, The Peth hit the small town of Bala. And Bala hits them back: Rhys Ifans gets in a fight with a local chip-shop owner, while two other members of the band are visited in their hotel room by the local constabulary. There is, as Ifans later describes it, \"claret all over the room.\" The police tell The Peth to \"have some breakfast, have a drink, and get out of town.\"</p> <p><strong>Thursday July 10: Blossom Street Studios and Hoxton Square Bar &amp; Kitchen, Shoreditch, London</strong></p> <p>The Peth straggle into a studio for the Weekend photoshoot. Rhys Ifans is wearing many of the same clothes he had on the previous week. But his T-shirt is new. With evident pride he says that a couple of fans made it for him. \"Ccadw Dy Fw*in Fish\" (\"Stuff Your Fucking Fish\"), it says, which is what - according to the papers - \"jilted star\" Ifans shouted at the Bala chip-shop owner.</p> <p>Nine-tenths of The Peth are wearing sunglasses. The only one who isn't is the one who's not actually in the band; he's a mate, and he's pretending to be the drummer, who's gone awol. </p> <p>\"It's the first time I've been on stage as me,\" reflects Ifans, of the Welsh shows. \"And this may sound such a naff thing, but in the initial daze of nervousness, because I didn't have a character, the sunglasses became so important. I did two gigs in girls' pink sunglasses. I've got to wean myself off the shades.\"</p> <p>Everyone drinks Kronenbourg, which has been hastily fetched by a studio assistant. Someone is rolling a joint. The attention span of this dirty near-dozen is not lengthy. A lone voice suggests they all stand in a long line for the photographer \"and someone will snort you\". </p> <p>\"I'll do that!\" bellows Ifans.</p> <p> The video for Let's Go Fucking Mental is being made by artists Jake and Dinos Chapman. \"I was hoping they'd just give me a mannequin with a cock coming out its head... We do share a very similar sense of humour,\" says Ifans. </p> <p>They first met when all three were hired by Italian fashion label Missoni. \"They do horrible clothes, but they wanted non-model models and they flew us out to Milan and said you can have some free clobber. Well, I'll go anywhere for free clobber. So it was me, Jake and Dinos and some other people I didn't know, and we had to do a catwalk show. We could barely walk in a straight line. </p> <p>\"So they're old friends,\" he continues. \"And I'm a fan of their work. But they wouldn't have offered to do this if they didn't like the music. They're very particular people.\"</p> <p>In fact, the Peth video commission - the first the brothers have accepted - is something of a favour returned. The Chapmans are currently making their own quasi-autobiographical film, featuring Ifans as their dad and Samantha Morton as their mum (next year, Ifans will also star in the brothers' first \"proper\" film, as an art critic). In return, Ifans asked if the Chapmans would make The Peth's music video.</p> <p>Ifans pulls up a still from the Chapmans' biopic on his mobile phone. It shows him and Morton standing beneath a giant model of a vaginal passage.</p> <p>Ifans says: \"It's the first time in my life where I'm not the biggest cunt in the room.\" </p> <p>Photoshoot quickly over, the band straggle out for the short walk to the Hoxton Square Bar &amp; Kitchen, venue for tonight's London debut. Their guest list numbers 260. \"Yeah,\" sniffs Ifans, \"if you want to rob Primrose Hill, tonight's the night.\"</p> <p>Sure enough, when The Peth take to the stage in the tiny sweat box, the audience includes Kate Moss and Sadie Frost dancing at the front, while The Charlatans' Tim Burgess and former Libertine Carl Bar\u00e2t linger near the back. </p> <p>As in Portmeirion, the gig teeters on the edge of sozzled chaos: on Let's Go Fucking Mental, Ifans manages to scream \"mental!\" only 17 times, while on bluesy ballad Stonefinger he seems to lose the plot entirely.</p> <p><strong>Monday July 28: Final Cut edit suite and Soho House, Soho, London</strong></p> <p>Is Stonefinger about you-know-who? The opening lines are: \"Every little thing you said would break me, all of it came true / Every bit of love I give, you mock it, yes you do...\" </p> <p>Thus far, I've been loth to mention Sienna Miller. In Portmeirion, a journalist from music magazine Q asked Ifans about his ex; Ifans responded by walking out. But at our first meeting, in the pub, when I suggested that Ifans sounds completely broken when he sings Stonefinger, he replied: \"I was, I was in a bad way... Heartbroken. It's a diary, in a way, this album. Coz I've been through several states of mind through the process...\" </p> <p>The Golden Mile has taken the best part of two years to make, with studio sessions in Cardiff fitted around other commitments. On the day they recorded Stonefinger, Ifans \"fell off the train, fell into the room, Daf stuck a mic in my face, I thought it was a fucking ice-cream, I was that off me head.\" </p> <p>Since Stonefinger's public unveiling in Portmeirion, The Sun - alongside splashes about Miller and her supposed new beau Balthazar Getty - have been reporting that the song is about Miller.</p> <p>Ieuan says that he wrote half the album's lyrics on his own, but Ifans wrote some bits and bobs, including Stonefinger. While Ifans is off on the phone I ask Ieuan which lines are about Miller. \"None whatsoever,\" he replies emphatically. When Ifans returns, I ask him to tell me about Stonefinger.</p> <p>\"I'd split up with me girlfriend. No, no, not the little one,\" he says, meaning Miller, adding that the lyrics are approximately 18 months old. So are any of the album's lyrics about... \"No, no, fuck no,\" he interjects. \"Jesus Christ, no. She doesn't deserve a fucking song, that one.\" </p> <p>It's lunchtime, and we're on the roof terrace of Soho House. Ifans was unsure if we'd get in; he thought he might still be banned from the private members' club after an \"incident\" involving a \"small fire\". But Jake Chapman has smoothed our passage. </p> <p>We had met at an edit suite earlier in the day to see a rough-cut of the Chapmans' video. There had been no sign of Ifans - Ieuan had last seen him at four that morning, going off with \"some bird\". He finally rolls in nearly an hour late, full of apologies and with the address of the edit suite written on a pink, heart-shaped Post-it note pinned to his chest. His underpants are poking out of his back pocket.</p> <p>The current public view of Ifans, as filtered through the papers, is of a brokenhearted, unhinged man partying his way through a break-up, his bonkers band a convenient excuse for rock'n'roll excess. </p> <p>\"Absolutely,\" he says, the band has been a refuge during his recent troubles. \"It all had a kind of poetic symmetry. I'm not the kind to lie down on a couch... This band was bang on the right time.\" His impulse was to think, \"right, I'm going back to gang life.\" </p> <p>But for all the shambling mess that seems to attend him, like the dustcloud hovering above Peanuts' Pig-Pen, Ifans is serious about The Peth, and serious about it not being seen as a dilettantish excursion by a bored thespian. \"This is a proper band,\" he and Ieuan chorus. No one wants Ifans's celebrity status to get in the way - even though it inevitably does.</p> <p>At Soho House The Peth drink cider and Ifans waves his underpants about. Chapman goes off home, motorbike helmet in hand; unbeknown to him, Ifans has secreted his pants inside.</p> <p>In a short while, Chapman returns, and it's on to the pub, followed by Soho House again. And it's only six o'clock in the evening. I leave soon afterwards, waking up on a bus, some distance past my house, without my bag containing my laptop, iPod, house keys, sunglasses. The next day I make frantic phone calls to the rest of our party, trying to retrieve it. Apparently, most headed home in the early evening but Ifans and Chapman kept going. We know this because Ifans is in the next day's papers, careering out of nightclub Bungalow 8 at 3.30am, straight into another fight with photographers. The stories report that he spent the evening with Rod Stewart's daughter Kimberly - another attempt, they suggest, to \"bounce back from his split from Sienna Miller.\" </p> <p>Then Ifans disappears. For two days. No one can reach him - except the long arm of the tabloid lens. They photograph him and Stewart leaving her house and having \"nosh in a seedy Soho strip club\". </p> <p>Many phone calls later, I finally receive word that Ifans has my bag. Remarkably, everything is there. Except my sunglasses. I text Jake Chapman to thank him for all his efforts in trying to locate Ifans and my bag. Shame about the glasses, I say, but in the circumstances, it's not surprising they've been lost.</p> <p>Chapman texts back. \"Think you'll find your glasses on the front page of most tabloids...\"</p> <p>I look online. Sure enough, there on The Sun's Bizarre pages is Rhys Ifans, strolling with his latest flame, wearing my sunglasses. At the time of writing, he still hadn't returned them. Not weaned off the sunglasses yet, then.</p>",
  "<p>Hinxted Hall looks as if it has been jilted; it has the sad, lost air of the morning after; even the stone appears shattered and gloomy, the turrets paranoid, the windows shuttered and closed like so many shut mouths, secretive. The roof totters on top of the house like a tipsy dancer barely holding the whole thing together, arms outstretched. I walked up to the Hall from the wild night in the woods. The thwarted wedding party moved out there at some point, everyone raving, looking for love or sex or both. </p> <p>I woke up in an uncomfortable position, my whole body aching. My head was throbbing, but worse than the screws driving straight into my temples, the rough, choppy feeling in my stomach - like a sea rising up and wanting to spew out of my mouth - worse than the clammy, sweaty hands and head, the sour smell and taste in my mouth, was the memory loss. The embarrassment of it! I have never been so drunk that things have just been wiped out. But the last thing I remember is going into the woods with the rest of the wrecked wedding group, who all seemed actually shattered and disappointed that the wedding had been called off, who had stayed on for the free food and booze. I took my fiddle into the woods and played, Will ye no' come back again? / Will ye no' come back again? / Better lo'ed, ye canna be, / Will ye no' come back again? and I nearly fell over when Bloss appeared through the trees, her face shining and open. Then there's another bit I remember when I took my fiddle and walked playing it through the woods, with Flute directing the flow of air against the edge of his red crane flute, and Strum strummed and Sweet Squeeze squeezed and Drummer marched behind us with his snare drum, booming out a strong back beat, and the whole party followed us like we were the Pied Pipers of Hamelin, and we all went deeper, deeper into the dark heart of the woods. I can't think what the song was that led us in. It was a goodbye song. Oh I remember that, it was daft. It was the Bay City Rollers! Bye bye baby, baby goodbye. / Bye baby, baby bye bye. / Bye bye baby . . . Faster and faster. Then we stuck on singing 70s songs as if each one was about the Wedding, roaring, laughing. Mama Told Me Not to Come, Just My Imagination (Running away with me), Take Me Home, Country Roads, Let It Be. I saw the lost boy with his green troll. The full moon looked like a troll's face. Someone, somewhere in the woods was flashing, holding on to seconds. Someone had a tiny video machine. I heard a voice I recognised saying, \"I'm uploading you lot on to YouTube.\" Then it's a blank. </p> <p>Next thing, the woods are on the move - Burnham Wood to Dunsinane! - and we're all back in Hinxted Hall. What a mess! Three very cross women curse in a corner of the house. The kitchen staff are muttering and moaning, moving empty bottles, broken glasses, empty plates. Flute and Sweet Squeezie are helping with the washing up. \"What is it with weddings now?\" one of the older kitchen women is saying. \"There's something out of control and excessive. Nobody knows how to behave. Manners are a thing of the past.\" I pick up a brush. I brush towards Bloss, who is in a corner gathering glasses. She turns around and gives me a blushing-blossing smile, but I'm none the wiser for it. I don't know if it's a what-were-we-like-last-night smile or a simple hello. That's the terrible thing about hangovers. You don't really want to show your hand, don't want to hand your hand over. I could hurt her feelings if I say, \"Did we kiss last night?\" I don't want to go up to her, brush in hand and brush over the whole thing. I try sentences out in my head. Sweeping is good for sentences. \"Did you enjoy last night?\" That's quite innocent and non-committal. She saves me. She says, \"Your band are lovely. You're the only ones helping us. The ones that made most mess, they're asleep all over the Hall. They came in from the woods and crashed. Old Mrs Cobb has got a cob on. Things have been broken. We're worried, when the owner comes back . . . He's away for long periods at a time. We'll get the blame.\" Bless Bloss! When she talks, she makes me feel safe. We don't need to talk about last night. That's what all sensible hungover people do, they gloss, like Bloss is glossing, moving swiftly on. Today Hinxted Hall is dealing with its demons, the wreckage and the lost wedding. It's all been documented, even more thoroughly than the wedding would have been. There's the Wedding Wood Album - what happened in the woods because the wedding would not happen. Jack Mercury has flashed and digitally flicked all night. \"Fiddle,\" Bloss says, \"don't you think cleaning up is good for the hangover?\" and it's the only reference she makes to it. </p> <p>The old Hall is starting to take on some sort of shape, part of the grandeur glinting through, morning's sunlight on the dance floor, catching the velvet curtains, which now look queenly, elegiac. The long wooden trestle tables are cleared of all the mess, and could be ready for a Burns supper. I get out my fiddle. Bloss's eyes light up when my fiddle is out. I've noticed that. I play one of my old Burns favourites. John Anderson, my jo, John, / When we were first acquent; / Your locks were like the raven, / Your bonie brow was brent. Bloss smiles. \"I know that one,\" she says. \"That is one of my favourite songs. What would that old couple make of this? That old couple married and happy all their years?\" Now we maun totter down, John, / And hand in hand we'll go, / And sleep thegither at the foot, / John Anderson, my jo. A whole married life in two verses. I laugh at the thought. Bloss has got quite a sense of humour. The sun is coming up in the sky and doesn't appear to be wobbling any more. I'm starting to feel quite all right. Just don't mention clams or whelks or oysters. Toast, that's the thing. Dry toast, and hair of the dog. \"Do you fancy a bloody Mary?\" I ask Bloss. \"Fiddle!\" she laughs. \"You're terrible, Fiddle.\"</p>",

  "<p><strong>\u00b7</strong> I've only watched a bit of the Olympics, but much of what I've seen involves our plucky commentators, Team BBC, finding ways of letting us down gently. \"Brilliant attempt, but just outside medal position ... hopes for gold tragically dashed ... things just didn't go right for the British team there ... luck as important as skill in this event ...\" You've heard it all many times.</p> <p>Things may have improved, but as I write, it makes the vainglorious boasting of ministers about how many medals we were going to win sound pretty silly. It's New Labour all over - you routinely promise the earth, and then, when the earth doesn't materialise, you pretend it has anyway. It's like Tony Blair's verb-free sentences, which offered golden aspirations rather than concrete promises. Blair's genius was to realise that hope for the future mattered more than disenchantment with the present. That's how he won three gold medals in elections.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> You'd have to be a pretty assiduous Guardian reader to remember the name of William Hanley. He worked at the paper for a few short months in 1968-69, and was a very talented reporter. His first article was a front-page scoop which he got by the unconventional but effective method of asking some senior politician \"Hello, have you got a leak for me?\".</p> <p>I knew Bill well as he and I were supposed to begin work on the same day (he had just graduated from the LSE) but the mental health problems which ruined his life meant that he arrived weeks late. We shared a flat, and he tried cooking. It was not his forte. He fried an egg for so long that it fused with the pan. Once our dinner was burnt tinned risotto with steel-hard sprouts. </p> <p>Bill was one of those people for whom life is just too much of a challenge. He showed me a letter from his bank manager, asking what he was going to do about his overdraft. \"I'll write a cheque to cover it,\" he said triumphantly, and he wasn't joking.</p> <p>On the other hand, he very often was joking. I suppose what he suffered from would now be called bipolar disorder. When he was on the high curve he was probably the most entertaining company of anyone I've ever met. In the late-night drinking clubs which adorned Manchester's version of Fleet Street he could keep teams of idealistic hacks and cynical printers doubled-up laughing with a tightly-controlled stream of hilarious consciousness - rather like Eddie Izzard, I sometimes think today. When the audience had succumbed totally he could say anything at all: \"Have another cream cracker!\" would bring whoops of helpless delight. He came from a working class family in Birkenhead, who found him bewildering. Bill used to claim he was a changeling.</p> <p>He was fired, and I could see why - he failed to turn up at a story once too often, and on a newspaper a day late is irrecoverable. We kept in touch; I felt like the lucky twin, the one who survived. Now and again, he'd request money, often curiously precise sums: \"I would be most grateful for \u00a317.99 for a new pair of shoes,\" or \"Please forward \u00a315.35 for the train fare to Glasgow, where I have an interview with a horse-breeding magazine.\" </p> <p>None of the job applications came to anything; the gap in his CV was just too great. And nothing, neither psychotherapy nor drugs, stopped his condition from worsening, though it was a pulmonary embolism that finally killed him last week. But he attracted great loyalty from people who saw the brilliant mind behind the mental wreck, and I suspect there will be many at the memorial gathering next month.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Another Guardian writer, also brilliant, and definitely not a wreck, is David McKie. With a mighty crash his latest book landed on my doorstep a few days ago. It's called McKie's Gazetteer, and it's published soon by Atlantic Books, who decided to risk running all its 668 pages in a book that weighs 3lb 2oz. It is about 150 different places in Britain, from Aan (a river in Scotland) to Zoze Point, Cornwall. In each David has found something fascinating - a historical nugget, a scandal, a long-forgotten legend, an extraordinary landmark, a piece of social observation; reading it is like a holiday in the company of a really interesting friend.</p> <p>For example, did you know there is a hillside in Pembrokeshire named after St Elvis, and that it was this Elvis who in the 11th century baptised St David? The claim that the singer was ethnically Welsh is, it appears, a strong one - the Preseli hills in the same county seem a likely source for his surname. His parents, Vernon and Gladys, both had Welsh names, and Jesse, the twin who was stillborn, was given the middle name of Garon, which is also Welsh.</p> <p>It would be nice to think that Elvis dropped hints about his background in records - Harlech Hotel, for example, Love Me Gwenda, and that rock classic, King Creigiau. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Another massive tome thumps on to my desk. It's Volume II of Bernard Donoughue's Downing Street Diaries, about the three years he spent working in No 10 for Jim Callaghan. Even people who don't remember those days may be intrigued - the incompetence of most ministers, their failure to shape up to the ghastly problems they faced, and the obstreperous civil service are all horrifying. But it answers another question. For decades now, people have puzzled about Harold Wilson's sensational resignation in 1976. Was it because he feared some terrible scandal? Or because he knew the economy was about to implode? On October 4 1978 Donoughue quotes Sir Ken Stowe, the private secretary to the prime minister, at a party during the Labour conference, \"revealing openly that H Wilson 'had heart attacks' in 1975-6\". Well, no wonder he had to resign. It may be just my own ignorance, but I really didn't know that.</p>",
  "<p>Few people have made such a smooth transition from business to the higher echelons of politics later in life than Sandy Bruce-Lockhart, who has died aged 66. After leading Kent county council for eight years, he became chairman of the Local Government Association (LGA) in 2004 - overturning a long period of Labour control - amiably negotiating with senior ministers as the public voice, and face of English councils on radio and television.</p> <p>A smooth performer, rarely rattled, he deployed the skill of the hardened politician, challenging but never confrontational as he railed against the centralism of the state and the steady erosion of local democracy. With the air of a quintessential establishment figure, almost everyone assumed he had been immersed in politics most of his adult life. Yet Sandy entered local government by chance. </p> <p>Politicisation came when, as chairman of the Weald of Kent preservation society's rail committee, he campaigned against what he saw as the destructive (former) route of the proposed Channel Tunnel rail link. That led to him joining the Conservatives in 1984 with the enthusiasm of the convert, becoming a county councillor five years later after a long spell growing apples and pears on his 300-acre fruit farm.</p> <p>Interviewing Sandy for Society Guardian, he confided to me that he probably would not have stood for the council but for pressure from the society. \"They needed a stronger voice and someone said 'why not stand?' and I thought 'why not?'\" His rise was rapid, soon becoming Conservative group leader and then, in 1997, leader of the council with the defeat of a loose Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition. \"I thought councillors were not quite members of the human race,\" he joked.</p> <p>A former senior official recalls the emergence of a middle-aged, right wing councillor, whom some feared would lead a \"slash and burn\" administration. For some, fears were realised when, fairly quickly in 1997, \u00a327m was chopped from the council's budget, the number of chief officers axed from 13 to six, and \"business units\" established covering all services in a council that serves 1.3 million people.</p> <p>But many recall, with affection, the steady conversion of the leader to more centrist ground. He conceded to me that he soon discovered the value of public service, delivered by people \"with a very strong ethic for helping others, deeply committed to their jobs ... I don't like people being rude about local government, particularly our social services staff, who do a fantastic job.\" The council employs 30,000.</p> <p>Sandy came from a relatively privileged background, with close family ties to the church and the diplomatic service; his father was a deputy director of MI6. After education at the Dragon school, Oxford, and Sedbergh school in Cumbria, he attended the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester, before running a large farm in former Rhodesia producing maize and raising cattle. </p> <p>Offended by the racism of southern Africa, he briefly moved to Australia before settling in Kent, where he farmed for 40 years.</p> <p>His leader's office, in County Hall at Maidstone, contained some of the family portraits, and memorabilia - alongside an old Southern Railway poster extolling the \"garden of England\". Proclaiming: \"Live in Kent and Be Content\", it became a mantra for his administration, neatly wrapped up in the county council's \"supporting independence\" programme. This was a bold attempt, warmly embraced by New Labour, to break a \"dependency culture\", particularly in less-affluent east Kent, and channel more people into work. \"If you really want to change lives, the biggest change you can make is to allow them to be independent,\" he explained. \"If you don't have that, you're fundamentally trapped. It's the great slavery of the day, isn't it?\"</p> <p>While Sandy acknowledged his council was seen as a shining star by New Labour - although for some its selective secondary school system, with grammar schools at the heart, remains socially divisive - he was ideologically some distance from the government, although on extremely friendly terms with ministers.</p> <p>\"In their hearts, Labour believes in the state and it is deeply ingrained,\" he once told me. \"For Conservatives, and certainly for myself, the opposite is true. Our ultimate belief is about freedom, independence, individualism - the characteristics that made this country great.\"</p> <p>Ann Widdecombe, Sandy's local MP - he formerly chaired her constituency party - described him, with some accuracy, as an \"old-style patrician Tory, with a very strong social conscience and a great sense of humour.\" Internationally, he held strong views - particularly what he saw as the subjugation of the Palestinians on the West Bank and Gaza.</p> <p>Sir Simon Milton, Sandy's successor as chairman of the LGA, recalled with a smile the people he held in high esteem. \"Aside from the Duke of Wellington, it was the unlikely pairing of Nelson Mandela and Madonna,\" he recalled. \"Sandy had a strong social conscience, a zest for life, courage, determination and a passionate commitment to public service.\"</p> <p>After leaving the chairmanship of the LGA in 2007, the year after his life peerage, Sandy became chairman of English Heritage - although he could clearly have commanded a front bench job in the Lords under David Cameron. Simon Thurley, chief executive of English Heritage, recalled a particular affection for Canterbury cathedral. \"But it wasn't just the rich and grand places he loved. He also treasured the hidden heritage of ordinary people in the rural farmhouses and the urban terraces, in the seaside at Margate and in the suburbs of Maidstone and Chatham.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> He is survived by his wife, Tess, two sons and one daughter. Alexander (Sandy) John Bruce-Lockhart, Baron Bruce-Lockhart of the Weald in the County of Kent, politician and farmer, born May 4, 1942, died August 14, 2008</p>",
  "<p>Recruitment group <strong>Michael Page </strong>fell 17.5p to 317.5p yesterday as it rejected a \u00a31.3bn bid from Swiss rival Adecco as too low, adding the offer structure was not attractive. Adecco said it remained keen on a deal, but analysts said the Swiss group would be hard pressed to improve its 400p-a-share terms.</p> <p>\"We believe it would be difficult for Adecco to improve this offer and justify it to its own shareholders,\" said Panmure Gordon. \"There is likely to be short-term speculation as to whether Adecco will turn its attention to Hays or Robert Walters. We would not bank on this, given that Adecco appeared to be most interested in Michael Page's brand, exposure to permanent recruitment and a specialist model.\"</p> <p>Jonathan Jackson, analyst at Killik Capital, said: \"Given the shares were trading below 250p only five weeks ago, the decision by management to reject a 400p cash offer is very brave. Either they are very upbeat on the outlook for trading or are confident that Adecco will return to the table. Our concern is Adecco may shy away from making a higher offer which may struggle to generate a satisfactory return and face shareholder opposition.\"</p> <p>Michael Page is due to report half-year results on Monday, and analysts expect news of a slowdown in trading in its UK and international businesses.</p> <p>Leading shares ended the week on a downbeat note, with the <strong>FTSE 100 </strong>down<strong> </strong>42.6 points at 5454.8. A fall in mining shares did much of the damage, after another drop in commodity prices. Copper slipped to a six-month low, a reaction to the strength of the dollar and growing concerns about declining demand. Oil was on the way down for similar reasons, with Brent crude dipping about $3 a barrel to around $110.</p> <p>So <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> closed 89p lower at \u00a311.73, <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> fell 67p to 969p and<strong> Anglo American</strong> dropped 188p to \u00a327.35. On the oil front, <strong>Tullow</strong> slipped 31p to 677p, <strong>BP</strong> lost 11.5p to 515.5p and <strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong> B shares slid 40p to \u00a317.63.</p> <p>But the jump in the US currency boosted dollar earners such as building materials group <strong>Wolseley</strong>, up 28p to 438.75p, and <strong>Rolls-Royce</strong>, 10.75p better at 398.25p.</p> <p>A number of retailers improved after reasonable weekly sales figures from John Lewis. </p> <p>Analysts at Kaupthing said: \"John Lewis figures show the department store division increased sales by 9.3% [year on year] partly against a softer comparison but also reflecting mixed weather that helped drive footfall into the stores. Waitrose's 'As good as going out' campaign (similar to <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong>'s Dine in for \u00a310) is up 43%, and we believe the comparable M&amp;S initiative is performing more strongly than that.\"</p> <p>M&amp;S added 10.25p to 276p, helped by news deputy chairman Sir David Michels and wife Michelle had jointly bought 37,734 shares at 265p each. <strong>Next</strong> rose 28p to \u00a310.37, while B&amp;Q owner <strong>Kingfisher</strong> climbed 3.2p to 130.1p.</p> <p>Leisure group <strong>Whitbread </strong>was 34p higher at \u00a311.83 after positive comments from Morgan Stanley, which has a \u00a317 target on the stock.</p> <p>Shares in <strong>London Stock Exchange</strong> have been under the cosh on competition concerns ahead of yesterday's low-key launch of rival trading platform Turquoise. In a case of sell on the rumour, buy on the fact, the actual launch day saw LSE's shares recover 6p to 803p.</p> <p>Turquoise, set up by a number of large investment banks, began by offering trade in 10 UK and German stocks, including <strong>Vodafone</strong>, and reportedly executed orders in all of them. It hopes to extend the service to 1,300 shares across 13 markets within the next few weeks. Talking of Vodafone, its shares slipped 0.25p to 139.65p as Collins Stewart issued a sell note in the wake of news that the company seems to have won the battle to take control of Ghana Telecom. The broker said the deal looked expensive, adding: \"We struggle to see how Vodafone can make an economic return on this investment.\"</p> <p>Software specialist <strong>Autonomy</strong> climbed 85p to \u00a311.43 on hopes it will join the FTSE 100 in next month's quarterly rejig.</p> <p>Housebuilders mounted a tentative revival, with <strong>Bovis Homes </strong>35p better at 451.75p, <strong>Barratt Developments</strong> up 6.5p to 131.25p and <strong>Taylor Wimpey</strong> 2.5p higher at 50.5p.</p> <p>Pharmaceuticals company <strong>Meldex</strong>, which recently called off takeover talks and announced the departure of its finance director, had some good news for shareholders. It is launching a range of its Menoflavon products, which it claims are a natural alternative to HRT. Its shares climbed 3.75p to 31p.</p> <p>Over on Aim, technology group <strong>Lo-Q</strong> jumped 7p to 31p after it reported better-than-expected half-year results.

After <strong>Protherics</strong> revealed a number of approaches this week - with <strong>AstraZeneca</strong> tipped as one possible predator - came news that <strong>Oxford BioMedica </strong>had rejected two offers from smaller US rival <strong>GeneThera. </strong>Oxford - whose shares slumped last month when its important cancer vaccine TroVax failed a trial - pointed out that GeneThera was worth $230,000 while its own market value was closer to \u00a350m. It said the unsolicited all-share offer was \"not credible\". Dealers said Oxford could now be in play, and its shares rose nearly 16% to 10.25p.</p>",
  "<h2>I can't get a job in the arts, despite being highly qualified </h2> <p><strong>I am from a working class background and after leaving school I decided I was going to get a trade. As I had achieved my highest GCSE result in woodwork, I chose carpentry. After successfully passing the course I got work immediately and stayed in work for seven months until I realised I hated my job. My real passion was for art so I decided to go back to college to study painting and drawing. I got my degree in fine art and after my BA I completed an MA in museum studies. </strong></p> <p><strong>But when I graduated I had great difficulty in getting job interviews, and if I did get an interview it was even harder to be successful. I applied for dozens and dozens of jobs over a lengthy period. I sought independent career advice and also contacted my former tutors for more advice on how to present myself in interviews, and how set out CVs and complete application forms. Added to this I had gained experience by volunteering in galleries and museums during my studies. I had been told I was qualified enough and I felt experienced enough to be applying for posts such as curatorial exhibition organiser and collections registrar, but apparently this wasn't the case. </strong></p> <p><strong>As I was getting into my late 20s I wanted to settle down and leave the parental home. The only way I could afford to do this was to return to carpentry. I have carried on for five years now and I have hated every minute of it. Do you think there is any way I can get a job in an art-related field and use the qualifications I have worked so hard to gain, or am I stuck doing something I loathe for the rest of my life? </strong></p> <p><strong>Have I been incredibly stupid and naive to think I could better myself and work in a field which I enjoy? Should I maybe return to part-time study in something similar to the arts or heritage such as design, teaching or even carpentry restoration?</strong></p> <p>Let me take your last two questions first. No, I don't think you've been stupid and naive. And no, I don't think that further part-time study is likely to be the answer. </p> <p>Like you, I'm at a bit of a loss to understand exactly why finding a post for which you're clearly qualified has proved such a problem; but I urge you not to resign yourself to doing a job you loathe for the rest of your life.</p> <p>There may be an element of old-fashioned snobbery here. You yourself mention that you come from a working class background and talk of bettering yourself. It's just possible that potential employers take a lead from this and absurdly assume that someone whose trade is carpentry couldn't possibly possess the finer sensibilities required of curatorial or exhibition work. Indefensible, I know - but, I'm afraid, entirely possible.</p> <p>Apart from encouraging you to persevere, my one bit of concrete advice is this: forget for a moment formal application forms and the correct way to present CVs. Use you own undoubted artistic talents to design a unique prospectus for yourself: and yes, I do mean using drawings as well as words. Don't bury your carpentry skills, use them as evidence of your practical side. Put together not so much an application as a portfolio that communicates your passion, your commitment, your qualifications and your individuality - and does it in such a way that your artistic skills are self-evident. </p> <p>It will be a challenge but I bet you can do it. And it won't impress everyone. But one or two people are going to say, \"He sounds interesting.\" And after that, you should be away. </p> <h2>What is the rule of thumb for taking time off for interviews?</h2> <p><strong>What is the etiquette on taking time off from your current job in order to go to interviews? Interviewing can be a time-consuming process - how can you justify this to your employers?</strong></p> <p>This is a question that perplexes a great many people; and as far as I know, there isn't an all-purpose answer to it. </p> <p>To get one thing out of the way immediately: no one has the right to demand of an employer that they be allowed time off for job interviews. (Interviews for openings within the same company are of course a different matter.) In any case, few people want their current employer to know they're on the look out for another job. Fail to get it and you're worse off than before: your boss now knows you've got itchy feet and also that you've been rejected by a competitor. </p> <p>Maybe the best way to think it through is this: the opportunity to be interviewed for a better job with better prospects is not one to be missed. Good jobs - jobs that match the person perfectly - are rare, so you must get to that interview somehow. </p> <p>The best of all solutions is to take a day out of your holiday allowance. That's your own time and how you use it is entirely your own affair. You don't have to feel surreptitious or guilty. Unfortunately, it's not always possible.</p> <p>Some potential employers offer interviews out of normal office hours but by no means all, and there's often quite a bit of travelling time to take into account as well. But it's worth asking.</p> <p>In the end, if you're to make that all-important interview, you may be driven to an element of deceit. If that's the case, be as thoughtful as you can towards your current employer and your colleagues. Don't leave them stranded. In many ways, the smaller the office, the more obvious an unplanned absentee becomes and the greater the inconvenience caused.</p> <p>While fictional dental appointments and second cousins' funerals are indisputably lies, most employers, however reluctantly, will recognise two facts of life. First, their employees will always be looking for ways to improve their lives. And second, the quest for a better job is almost certain to involve some secrecy. </p> <p>It's not perfect but I hope it helps.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> For Jeremy Bullmore's advice on a work issue, send a brief email to <a href=\"mailto:work@theguardian.com\">work@theguardian.com</a>.

  "<p>Reading different western media sources, I - as a Russian who grew up in Ossetia - was struck by the fact that everyone rushed to accuse Russia of attacking the presumed-innocent Georgia; why does everyone forget that Georgia was the first to attack the peaceful town of Tskhinvali? I don't approve of any violence against civilians, but how could the Russian government leave its citizens to die in South Ossetia? We could not but send our troops there to protect women and children attacked by the Georgian army.</p> <p>I'm deeply hurt by the fact that we are so much hated by the whole world for protecting the innocent. My understanding is that each country is supporting Georgia for its own ends and really doesn't care about Georgia's population. Friends who saw the attacks on Tskhinvali have told me that Georgian tanks were running into women and children, and soldiers were finishing off the wounded and throwing grenades into cellars where civilians were hiding from the shooting. War is always violent, but why does everyone make a victim of the real aggressor, of the real fascist? I happen to love the Georgian people, they are as open and friendly as everyone in the small southern provinces of the former Soviet Union, but we are not to blame for their deaths in this war. Their president is. Please let the whole world see what is really going on; I only want to have justice and I want this bloody war over.<br><strong>Evgenia Kosyanova</strong><br>Vladikavkaz, Russia </p> <p>Many who write about Georgia these days are doing a disservice to truth and to the chances of a viable solution by whipping up anti-Russian hysteria. The calm reader might thus like to reflect more on the following facts:</p> <p>1. It was the Georgian president who began this crisis, seriously misjudging his opponent and weakening his own country. In the Japanese culture this would lead to hara-kiri; we in the west usually expect an honorable resignation.</p> <p>2. The US attempt in Bucharest last spring to add Georgia to Nato must not be forgotten. It was rightly seen by the Russians as an attempt to continue to destabilise them. Again American planners misjudged the power and character of Vladimir Putin; and both are formidable.</p> <p>3. The above were not isolated phenomena. For years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, American politicians have repeatedly been humiliating a nation which, whether we like it or not, is both great and proud. They are now reaping the whirlwind and, alas, so are we.</p> <p>4. Talk of violation of sovereignty has become meaningless after Iraq and Afghanistan, and the invasion of northern Cyprus, not to mention the repeated bombardments of Syria and Lebanon by Israel and its famous attack on Iraqi installations, which many of us fear it would like to repeat in Iran if given half a chance. State sovereignty is, indeed, sacred unless it is we who violate it!</p> <p>There is a growing feeling that the Bush administration is one of the worst in US history. Sensible Europeans should try to ensure that in its dying days America does not make matters worse; and if Europe cannot restrain its ally, it should stay clear of new American follies.<br><strong>Basil Markesinis</strong><br>Bicester, Oxfordshire </p> <p>The Polish/US joint decision to site interceptor missiles on Polish soil (US rules out military role in Georgia but warns Russia off, August 15) is ill-considered. However, the secondary decision to add Patriot missiles and create a permanent US military base in Poland is strategically provocative.</p> <p>There are already 800 US military bases in 63 countries, with upwards of 250,000 US military deployed worldwide. The US also claims strategic control of space. It is surely self-evident that the siting of yet another US military position close to the Russian border will be guaranteed to provoke an escalation in tensions and \"cold war\" rhetoric.</p> <p>The world desperately needs a different approach. \"Fear\" is a weapon of mass destruction and it is being evoked with increasing frequency, intensity and irresponsibility, driving up the geopolitical stakes and placing the chance of war higher and higher up the agenda. Defusion of such an acute danger is the key for our collective security. The real power needs to be with the peace brokers.<br><strong>Julian Rose<br></strong>Whitchurch-on-Thames, Oxfordshire</p>",
  "<p>The very term gap year is a misnomer; it implies a space to be filled, something passively waiting rather than a period when a young adult will be actively constructing an identity and taking responsibility for their own lives in a way unlikely to be matched by friends going straight to university or college.

What a gap experience will do, though, is change you; your outlook, your attitudes, your plans will all be informed by the experiences you have had and things you have seen. You will have had to develop personal responsibility and independence.

You are someone who values spontaneity and embraces the unknown. Your gap year will just happen; the round-the-world ticket with no pre-planned stops is purchased and you are ready to go. If a single place appeals to you, then you could stay there for the whole year - or just wander to a different place every week. Who knows. You need to explore what you want to get out of your gap year, to go with all the photos and memories. Don't search for the exciting just for the sake of stimulation; life is sometimes calm and mundane and yet still enjoyable.</p> <p><strong>Mostly b)s</strong></p> <p>You like to plan ahead, so you would probably be attracted to a structured experience such as those provided by commercial companies. These can be expensive and some feel a bit \"packaged\". You could try to find local charities that take volunteers if they have certain skills, and then apply yourself to acquiring those skills. Or apply to one of the UN projects where young people from two countries spend several months working together on a local community project. But give yourself time for a bit of spontaneity, too - it will give you confidence in your ability to deal with uncertainties. And life is filled with these.</p> <p><strong>Mostly c)s</strong></p> <p>You would like your gap year to relate to your career plans. You might be planning actual employment relating to your anticipated career. Try to think outside the box, too, and look for transferable skills; these might be organisational (getting visas and tickets coordinated takes some skill), communication (persuading that office manager in Ulan Bator to give you a job) or even practical. Take the opportunity to learn a new language and you will demonstrate to a future employer not just a useful skill but also your capacity for tenacity and hard work.</p> <p><strong>Mostly d)s</strong></p> <p>You are the kind of person who sees no great benefit in being a long way from home; you enjoy finding out more about your own community. Talk of a gap year tends to invoke an image of far-flung and exotic places, so your initial thoughts might be that a gap year isn't for you. Why not consider spending some time working and travelling in one of the most beautiful islands in the world? There are opportunities to work in a range of paid occupations (including community projects) and get to meet other international travellers.

George Franklin, 23, who admitted one count of causing death by dangerous driving, had ridden the bike at up to 20mph along a pavement in an act of crass stupidity, Judge Michael Heath said at Lincoln crown court.

  "<p>Louis CK is fast establishing himself as the comedian's comedian over in the States, with anyone who is anyone on the American comedy circuit dropping his name as their favourite stand-up. His set deals with family life - a sort of postmodern, mother-in-law set - and it's tinged with sarcasm and hatred based around his feelings on the futility of family life. \"I don't sleep much,\" he says. \"I would rather sit in a chair and stare at nothing than anything in the world.

  "<p>In 2001, a Russian arms-control researcher contacted the energy ministry to arrange a visit to the nuclear weapons design centre at Sarov. Three hours later they phoned back and told him to go to a specific ticket booth at Moscow's Kazan train station. When he got there, he was handed a ticket for an overnight train to a totally different destination. In the middle of the night, his carriage was decoupled from the train and shunted on to another track. Eventually his train arrived at the main entrance to Sarov, a secret city during the cold war known only by its postcode, Arzamas-16. Uniformed guards entered his compartment and, after searching him and his belongings, they handed him his entry permit. </p> <p>This story is told by Nathan Hodge and Sharon Weinberger, a husband-and-wife team of US defence reporters turned nuclear tourists. It could have come from a John le Carr\u00e9 novel, and it serves as a vivid example of the \"culture of suspicion\" that still dominates Russia's nuclear establishment. Indeed, by the time Hodge and Weinberger visited in 2006, the level of paranoia had increased and their attempts to gain access to such sites were rejected. They had more luck, however, in the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan. When it declared independence in 1991, it was the proud owner of the world's fourth largest nuclear arsenal: 104 ICBMs and 40 bombers, a grand total of 1,360 warheads. Fortunately it agreed to give them up in 1994 and today, keen to reveal the full extent of its nuclear victimhood, Kazakhstan promotes the Semipalatinsk Test Site as a tourist destination. As Hodge and Weinberger discover, the site is still highly radioactive. Most of the scientists who lived in the nearby secret nuclear city of Kurchatov have now returned to Russia, but some technicians remain. Asked about the measures they took to protect themselves from radioactivity, one replies dryly: \"Before every test, we drank grain alcohol.\" </p> <p>A Nuclear Family Vacation is an entertaining if not always successful attempt to explore today's world of nuclear weapons from the viewpoint of the nuclear tourist. As the title suggests, the authors did indeed visit many of the places during their holidays. Although they claim to be mere tourists, the fact that Hodge and Weinberger are also journalists opened doors usually closed to tour groups, allowing them, for example, to visit Iran's Esfahan Uranium Conversion Facility, which supplies material to the top-secret uranium enrichment facility at Natanz. (Although, as they point out, in 2006 the Iranian president did promise that he would open his nation's nuclear facilities to foreign tourists.) But outside of America, cold war habits die hard. Their attempts to break through the wall of secrecy surrounding non-American facilities, although rich in amusing anecdotes, add little to our understanding of nuclear issues. </p> <p>Their visits to US sites are, however, more revealing. As well as touring the Nevada Test Site (a \"sandbox for nuclear weapons designers\"), missile silos, and the Cheyenne Mountain bunker (\"the ultimate cold war retreat\"), they also visit Los Alamos, where the original atomic bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki were designed. The authors noticed that the scientists sometimes had pictures of their favourite nuclear tests hanging above their desks and could describe, \"in loving detail, the very personal reasons for their choices\". One scientist even named his son after the 1952 Ivy Mike H-bomb test. But weapons designers are a dying breed and most are due to retire soon. Los Alamos hasn't designed a new nuke since the 1980s, and has become little more than a \"repair shop for nuclear weapons\". The scientists are not happy; according to Hodge and Weinberger, \"the mood at the lab hovered somewhere between depression and despair\". </p> <p>It is a great pity, though, for those buying the book on this side of the Atlantic, that Hodge and Weinberger do not investigate the situation in the UK. After scant public debate, Britain and France are both modernising their nuclear deterrents. But as the authors say in their perceptive epilogue, the whole idea of deterrence as regards nuclear weapons looks increasingly problematic. They interviewed many people, from politicians to scientists, yet failed to find anyone \"who could articulate what the current role of the nuclear arsenal is\". The whole \"nuclear weapons complex\", costing billions of dollars a year, is an enterprise that has \"lost its way\". They conclude that it may indeed be time for the US to think the unthinkable and \"explore practical options for eliminating the nuclear arsenal\". </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>PD Smith's Doomsday Men is published by Penguin</p>",
  "<p>A'ida lives in a town named Sucrat; her beloved, Xavier, is incarcerated in cell 73 of the prison in nearby Suse, serving a double life sentence for crimes of terrorism. So much we learn from the author's foreword and from A'ida's miraculously recovered letters to Xavier. They, with some notes he wrote on them, are the substance of the novel, and A'ida's warm and shining spirit illumines it.</p> <p>Her world is divided into Us and Them. \"We\" are ordinary people getting by: the poor, the powerless, the kind-hearted, the freedom-loving, the hopeful. \"They\" are the power that jails terrorists while terrorising the country with all the apparatus of militarised imperialism. \"We\" have names and faces, \"they\" do not. A'ida sees eyes in the gun slits of the tanks surrounding her group of unarmed protesters, but the pitted metal armour of the tank is more vivid to her. The inhumanity of such conquest leaves humanity to the conquered, with their passive resistance and guerrilla retaliation, their individual courage, moral resolve and loyalty to one another.</p> <p>This has been one of our central stories, in fact and fiction, for at least two centuries: the all-but-defenceless defenders of justice facing the might of an oppressive government. Leonora/Fidelio risking her life for imprisoned Florestan; partisans against fascists; the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo standing in silence before the house of power . . . The story has mythic force, but it is also actual, re-enacted again and again all over the world; and even supporters of \"legitimacy\" find it hard not to side with the underdog, the boy who dances in front of the advancing tanks.</p> <p>As author of this version of the tale, John Berger has found a voice perfectly fitted to express an emotional sincerity quite rare in fiction at the moment. A'ida comes across in her letters as a passionate, generous, immensely likeable woman with an excellent mind, completely devoted to her cause and her man. She's so much the woman an intelligent man in prison might dream of that I briefly wondered if Xavier was writing her letters himself, but this is a subtle novel, not a tricksy one. A'ida tells Xavier of her love for him in lovely ways. She describes with wit and kindness the people she deals with in her work as a pharmacist, and gives a clear though never explicit picture of the endless crisis of violence her people are living through - the power outages, shortages, flyovers, raids, disappearances.</p> <p>Who, then, are her people? Where are Sucrat and Suse? No religions or religious observances are mentioned, no sects or dialects, no political parties or factions. The names of A'ida's friends lead us all over Europe and the Middle East, although seldom, if ever, to an English-speaking land - Gema, Amitera, Yaha, Emil, Zakaria, Susan, Naci, Valentina, Koto, Yasmina, Ved . . . \"We\", then, are individuals free of the bonds of religion, nation or party. The reader may imagine these people anywhere, anytime.</p> <p>But \"they\", while individually nameless, are explicitly identified and localised by their weapons and acronyms: WTO, Nafta, Apache aircraft, Predator drones, Hellfire missiles, Humvees. \"They\" are world capitalism and its chief instrument at the moment, the US.</p> <p>To my mind, this one-sided identification sadly diminishes the moral reach of the book. Because their religion and politics are never mentioned, A'ida's people are exonerated from bigotry and political folly or factionalism. All crime and error accrue to the named, known enemy. Perhaps A'ida has to believe that, but I cannot.</p> <p>Late in the book she writes of \"a secret practice of women, men, old people, children\": \"Now consider human lives, their every-minute, every-day lives! Their lives depend upon an agreed regularity to which each contributes. Maintaining this regularity is the forgotten practice I'm talking about.</p> <p>\"It explains the arrival of the fruit in the market each day, the lights in the street at night, the letters slipped under the front door, the matches in a match box all pointing in the same direction, music heard on the radio, smiles exchanged between strangers. The regularity has a beat, very distant, often inaudible, and at the same time similar to a heartbeat.</p> <p>\"No place for illusions here. The beat doesn't stop solitude, it doesn't cure pain, you can't telephone it - it's simply a reminder that you belong to a shared story.\"</p> <p>This is a beautiful, moving description of community, of human civilisation, of how we fit into our ecosystem, our rightful place in the world. But it goes on: \"And in our life today we are condemned to endless irregularity. Those who impose this on us are frightened by our irregularity. So they build walls to keep us out.\"</p> <p>The enemy are frightened of our irregularity, so they impose it on us? The argument has gone to pieces. There are other such passages in the book where wisdom and tenderness descend abruptly into political sentimentalism. If such lapses are deliberate, meant to show Xavier's ideology (whatever it is) and A'ida's idealism as fatal weaknesses, then Berger's view of humanity is a very bleak one.</p> <p>I don't think it is. The author's real charity will carry his book<strong> </strong>past such lapses and on into a later time when nobody cares what \"Humvee\" meant, any more than we now care who jailed Florestan, and when no self-righteous hatred dims his respect for human loyalty and hope for human justice.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ursula K Le Guin's novel Lavinia will be published next year by Gollancz.</p>",

  "<p>More than 400,000 holidaymakers face severe disruption at the end of the month after staff voted to go on strike at Britain's two busiest airports for charter airlines and low-budget carriers. </p> <p>Union leaders warned that industrial action at Gatwick and Stansted could spread across the UK with workers at Manchester, Birmingham and Newcastle airports also holding walk-out ballots. </p> <p>Baggage handlers and check-in staff at Gatwick and Stansted will stage 24-hour strikes on bank holiday Monday, August 25, and on August 29 after rejecting a 3% pay offer. The strike by workers at airport services firm Swissport will affect services by Gatwick-based airlines including Virgin Atlantic, Thomsonfly, Monarch and First Choice, and flights operated by Ryanair and easyJet at Stansted, where they are the biggest customers.</p> <p>The Unite union said all airlines using Swissport's services would be grounded. \"The flights could not operate. If these strikes go ahead it would effectively shut down the airlines' operations,\" said Steve Turner, Unite's secretary for aviation.</p> <p>Swissport and airport owner BAA were holding talks with airline bosses last night to gauge whether they can keep flights running with a skeleton workforce. Swissport said it hoped to \"minimise disruption to the travelling public\" while one airline, Virgin Atlantic, said it had contingency plans in place and expected \"business as usual\" for its Gatwick flights. Ryanair said it would operate hand-luggage-only flights if the strikes go ahead. </p> <p>Services to Las Vegas, Lanzarote and Malaga will be among the flights affected on August 25 and 29. Industry experts warned that passengers should at least expect delays, if not cancellations, if last-ditch negotiations fail.</p> <p>\"The airlines and Swissport will attempt to draft in management and where possible use non-unionised workers,\" said John Strickland, an airline consultant. \"There will be a risk of delays and this is worst time of year for it to happen, at the peak of the summer season when flights are their fullest.\" Swissport said it intended to continue talks with the Unite and GMB unions over averting the strikes. </p> <p>BAA's much-maligned airports have had an uneventful summer but their vulnerability to operational mishaps was underlined on Thursday, when thousands of passengers at Heathrow's Terminal 3 had to fly without their bags after a computer glitch shut down the baggage handling system. BAA said 3,500 bags were separated from their owners following the software breakdown, which also saw 4,500 passengers ordered to queue outside the terminal after check-in desks were closed. The airport group said airlines had begun reuniting passengers with their bags.</p> <p>Gatwick and Stansted are the UK's second and third largest airports and will handle a total of more than 200,000 passengers a day over the bank holiday weekend. Holidaymakers will be most affected because both airports are popular with charter and low-budget carriers. </p> <p>Unite described the 3% pay offer as an insult and has demanded a pay rise of 5% for its members, in the latest pay dispute to focus on the rising rate of inflation. \"Our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs. This pay offer is an insult to professional, hard-working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions. Our members have had enough,\" said Unite's Turner. </p> <p>A Ryanair spokesman said: \"This strike is totally unjustified. Union chiefs should be grateful that they are getting any increase at all at a challenging time for the global economy.\"</p> <p>Baggage screeners at Stansted have also voted to go on strike, but the airport said services would not be affected. </p> <p>BAA is braced for another blow next week, when the Competition Commission is expected to demand the sale of Gatwick and one Scottish airport. The competition watchdog has indicated BAA's monoply over airports in the south-east is bad for airlines and passengers because it encourages the group to hold back plans for runways and under-invest in services.</p>",

  "<p>Gaynor Arnold's first novel is a plump, enthusiastic retelling of Charles Dickens's life from the viewpoint of his estranged wife, Catherine. The pair appear here in the guise of hugely popular writer Alfred Gibson and his wife Dorothea. Alfred, symbol of the Victorian age, the self-styled One and Only, is to be buried, his last work unfinished, to a deafening chorus of national mourning. </p> <p>Ten years earlier, with tactical cruelty, he had ousted Dorothea - passive, eternally with child - from their home to indulge his infatuation with a young actress, Wilhemina Ricketts. With Dorothea's sister, Sissy, ensconced as housekeeper and surrogate mother, the docile \"Dodo\" (the abbreviation implies extinction) is dispatched to a dingy basement with no company save a wheezing dog and a servant. Her occasional visitors include wilful Kitty, the Gibsons' eldest, and Kitty's ineffectual husband Augustus, constantly pursued by creditors. Contact with Alfred and with Dorothea's other children has been abruptly severed.</p> <p>The story opens on the day of Gibson's funeral at Westminster Abbey. Uninvited, Dorothea reflects on their 20 years together before the humiliating separation. Sentimental early recollections of the determined, witty young clerk's importunate wooing of the fair-haired \"girl in a blue dress\", her prosperous parents' disapproval, and their whirlwind wedding are coupled with admiration and resentment at Alfred's prodigious work ethic and overwhelming ambition.</p> <p>Most unnerving for the bride is Alfred's interest in Alice, Dorothea's teenage sister, who moves in with them at Alfred's insistence. Alfred treats the girl with a playful yet intense regard. When she suddenly dies, his grief is manifested in an astonishing, disabling manner. This is no exaggeration. Dickens displayed similar desolation at the death of his sister-in-law Mary Hogarth; like the fictional Alice, she served as a model for idealised womanhood in subsequent books. </p> <p>With a sequence of unasked-for pregnancies and Alfred's growing fame, the Gibsons' marriage slowly deteriorates. She remains at home dosed with laudanum while he moves among his adoring public. The crisis is Alfred's meeting with Ricketts and her mother, whom Dorothea imagines \"in brass, two vulgar images, side by side\". Again, this aspect of Dickens's life has been much pored over, most convincingly in Claire Tomalin's biography of Ellen Ternan, ambiguous object of Dickens's crippling middle-aged passion.</p> <p>The torrent of memories galvanises Dorothea into belated action, and as her children sheepishly re-establish contact she is emboldened to venture from semi-reclusiveness. A summons for an audience with Queen Victoria (a small, stout widow like herself) and a showdown with Ricketts (a virtuoso performance from the alleged mistress) are both well-delivered dramatic pieces of fluctuating emotion.</p> <p>Dorothea's too swiftly liberated persona - and what it can achieve - is much less credible, and falters during the final pages, but Arnold's portrayal of Gibson/Dickens is spot-on - charismatic, theatrical, depressive; preoccupied with death and with childhood; endlessly courting celebrity and reputation. Accurate too is the recreation of Dickens's boisterous household: \"a collective hullabaloo with him at the centre\", the children in thrall to the great man's irascibility, \"as if the family were a miniature version of his damned public\". Arnold acknowledges a debt to the many varied accounts of Dickens's life - it's frustrating that these are not properly cited. Another entertaining slice of Victoriana ventroiloquism, but no more than that, Girl in a Blue Dress is the latest Man Booker longlisting for independent Tindal Street. Yet overall it lacks the depth and sheer chutzpah that should inform the judges' final selection.</p>",
  "<p>Giacomo Casanova may not have been a tinker or a tailor, but he was briefly a soldier and certainly a spy, not to mention a trainee cleric, a diplomat, entrepreneur, musician, cabbalist and, of course, lover, too. That he was able to slip between so many roles is testimony not just to the times in which he lived - an 18th-century Europe in which professional identities had yet to settle - but also to his own protean self. For if Ian Kelly has one thing that he wants us to take away from this great onward rush of a biography, it is that Casanova remained as he had begun, a professional actor whose life's work was the performance of his own mercurial self.</p> <p>He was born poor and rackety in 1725, the probably illegitimate child of a Venetian stage comedienne. The fact that his mother had affairs with any important passerby, including the Prince of Wales, scarcely translated into viable social capital. Instead, it was Casanova's obvious cleverness and curiosity which got him an education that culminated in becoming a doctor of law at the age of just 16. His precocity showed in other ways, too. His first love affair, at 11, was a textbook seduction by the slightly older girl whose job it was to keep him clean. A bit of thigh-washing led to a delicious first climax and, almost as inevitably, into a complicated m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois involving his nursemaid's official swain. Here was the template for the rest of Casanova's 130-odd affairs (Kelly has counted them). From now on he would tend to put himself in situations where the woman's pre-existing commitments meant that he was unlikely to be called upon to offer a second date, let alone marriage. </p> <p>Kelly's main source for all this is, of course, Casanova's Histoire de ma Vie, the 12-volume CV which the old rou\u00e9 wrote at the end of his life when he was a crabby librarian (yet another new career) in a mouldering castle in north-east Bohemia. Like all Casanova biographers, Kelly's main challenge is to decide how to deal with this mountain of memoir. Simply to take it on trust would be pointless and dull. Yet to subject Casanova's account of himself to a truth test is to miss the point entirely. For Histoire de ma Vie is what critical theorists like to call \"a self-fashioning text\", an attempt not to record faithfully a life already lived, but rather to create it at the moment of writing. Or, to put it another way, what matters is not what actually happened, but what Casanova says happened. What the reader subsequently thinks about it all adds a third, complicating layer.</p> <p>Thankfully none of this gets in the way of a good old-fashioned sex romp, which is why, after all, people keep on wanting to read and write about Casanova. Kelly is not too proud to give us what he knows we're really after: naughty nuns, threesomes, virginity-taking, girls pretending to be boys pretending to be girls, and lots of peeping through keyholes. If, at times, the narrative seems in danger of degenerating into Carry On Casanova, there is always a lurking sense of sadness to offset it. Only people with very specialist tastes could find the thought of the ageing rou\u00e9 making a play for his own daughter, a girl whom, typically, he hasn't seen since her birth, anything other than deeply bleak. And then there's all the mess and pother of sex in the Enlightenment Age: once you'd sluiced out a reusable condom and downed a ton of mercury to deal with your syphilis, it's a wonder that you ever felt romantically inclined in the first place.</p> <p>In order to emphasise his central point that Casanova's life should be understood as a series of performances, Kelly organises his biography into Acts and Scenes. This struck me as slightly heavy-handed, although it does offer the chance for a really fine \"Intermezzo\" in which Kelly halts the action and talks directly to the audience about Casanova and travel, sex and, most interestingly, food. For not only did Casanova love eating, seeing it as both parallel and analogous to sex, he adored writing about it, too. It comes as no surprise that during his last, grumpy period in Dux, when he was scarcely able to perform the act of love, he still mustered the energy to quarrel daily about the strength of his coffee. </p> <p>Anyone who writes about Casanova is standing on a whole cohort of shoulders, so it is entirely to Kelly's credit - specifically, his ability to reimagine life on the hoof in 18th-century Europe as a series of exhilarating mini-dramas - that he has managed to make this story feel so fresh again.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Kathryn Hughes's biography of Mrs Beeton is published by Harper Perennial.</p>",
  "<p>Golda Meir was the only woman among the founding fathers of the state of Israel. In many ways, her story reflects the story of Israel itself. A working-class girl from pogrom-ridden Russia, she had a stormy adolescence in Milwaukee, emigrated to Palestine in 1921, and rose steadily through the ranks of the Labour party to become Israel's labour minister, foreign minister and finally prime minister. </p> <p>Even at the height of her power, \"Golda\", as she was affectionately called, retained her warmth and informality. She looked like a kindly Jewish grandmother, with her craggy face, baggy suits, orthopaedic shoes and old-fashioned handbag, but this homely exterior masked a pugnacious personality, a burning ambition, monumental egocentrism and an iron will. </p> <p>The subtitle of this new biography is problematic. She may have been \"the iron lady\" of Israel but she was most emphatically not a lady of the Arab people. Indeed, far from being a regional icon, Meir personified the most paranoid, aggressive and racist attitudes of the Zionist movement when it came to dealing with the Arabs. She was afraid of Arabs, and her fears were fuelled by personal memories of pogroms and by the collective Jewish trauma of the Holocaust. Meir's position was simple: them or us. She absolutely refused to accept that the Arabs were moved by a sense of injustice, that they felt humiliated, or that they had a different narrative of the conflict in Palestine. </p> <p>Elinor Burkett's biography is readable and fair-minded, but rather superficial. It is based largely on secondary sources, newspaper reports and interviews with the subject's family and friends. The book does not break any significant new ground and, contrary to the extravagant claims of the blurb, makes hardly any use at all of the official documents released under Israel's liberal 30-year rule. Burkett is better at dissecting the many-sided personality of this unusual leader than at analysing the political context in which she operated, and is at her best when contrasting Meir's tawdry private life with her sanctimonious public posturing.</p> <p>Meir emerges from this account as a terrible mother and a dreadful wife. She spent so little time with her two small children that they were happy when she suffered one of her regular migraine attacks because it meant she had to stay at home with them. Later on she insisted that one of her grandchildren, who was born with mild Down's syndrome, be sent away to an institution. Meir also cheated on her long-suffering husband, Morris. Sometimes she had more than one lover on the go. But although she herself was a liberated woman, she never supported feminism as a political cause.</p> <p>From the beginning Meir belonged to the hawkish wing of the Labour party. In 1956 David Ben-Gurion chose her to replace the moderate Moshe Sharett as foreign minister in order to clear the decks for the sordid collusion with the colonial powers to attack Egypt. Meir had few qualifications for the job; she was preferred mainly because she accepted Ben-Gurion's conception of the Foreign Ministry as little more than the PR wing of the Ministry of Defence. She was, in fact, the perfect henchwoman for the chief proponent of the policy of clobbering the Arabs hard until they surrendered. </p> <p>Meir's imperious personality, temper tantrums, uncontrollable urge to be didactic and her disdain for diplomats did little to endear her to her staff at the Foreign Ministry. Nor was she a patch on her predecessor when it came to presenting Israel's case abroad. Abba Eban, who was extraordinarily eloquent in seven languages but had the backbone of a noodle, observed that his boss used only 200 words, although her vocabulary extended to 500. </p> <p>When prime minister Levi Eshkol died in February 1969, Meir was 71 years old, retired from politics and undergoing treatment for cancer in Switzerland. The polls showed that only 3% of Israelis favoured her as prime minister. Nevertheless, the Labour party bosses chose her as caretaker leader, believing that only she could head off a clash between Moshe Dayan and Yigal Allon. The experience of supreme power, however, acted as a tonic, giving Israel's first female prime minister a new lease of life and sustaining her for five more years at the top.</p> <p>Like Margaret Thatcher, she was a conviction politician who radiated authority, but she was intellectually incapable of making the kind of subtle distinctions that are so crucial in the conduct of foreign policy. Her innate personal stubbornness was translated into a national posture in the Middle East conflict, with disastrous consequences for her own people and for the region as a whole. To be fair, Meir did not initiate the building of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories - a violation of international law and the main obstacle to peace. But she turned the preservation of the post-1967 territorial status quo into a sacred mission that precluded any peaceful settlement of the dispute with the Arabs. </p> <p>One does not need a rich vocabulary to say \"no\". She said \"no\" to every peace plan during her premiership and had none of her own to put forward. In February 1971, President Anwar Sadat of Egypt presented a plan for an interim settlement based on a limited Israeli withdrawal into Sinai and the reopening of the Suez Canal to international shipping. Even some of the battle-hardened generals saw merit in this proposal, but Meir rejected it, at least partly for personal reasons: she did not want to go down in Zionist history as the first leader to retreat from territory. It is probable that progress on Sadat's proposal could have prevented the outbreak of the Yom Kippur war, which claimed the lives of 2,838 Israeli soldiers. But Meir was wedded to the policy of attrition. It left the leaders of Egypt and Syria no option but to resort to military force in order to break the diplomatic deadlock. This is what they did on October 6 1973, taking the Israel Defence Forces by complete surprise and forcing it on to the defensive. </p> <p>The war was a monumental strategic blunder. Burkett argues that Meir's iron resolve stood between Israel and surrender after the defence minister, Moshe Dayan, lost his nerve in the initial phase of the conflict. But it was Meir's myopia, arrogance and diplomatic intransigence that were primarily responsible for the outbreak of this war in the first place. A commission of inquiry exonerated the prime minister, but the Israeli public took to the streets in protest and her career came crashing down in flames. </p> <p>Meir never tired of repeating that she was ready to travel to any corner of the earth, at any time of day or night, to meet any Arab leader who wanted to talk about peace. The reality did not match the rhetoric, and most of her officials knew this. Behind her back they used to joke about Golda's launderette, which was open 24 hours a day. A fitting epitaph might have been: \"Golda's launderette is closed for the duration.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Avi Shlaim is a professor of international relations at the University of Oxford.

  "<p>Benzion Dunner led a tragic life and died a tragic death. Neither was apparent in the days following the Bournemouth road accident in which he died last March. Driving his Bentley Arnage, he collided with another vehicle, lost control of his car and hit a tree. Fortunately neither his passengers nor the occupants of the other car suffered more than minor injuries. But he was killed outright.</p> <p>Great indeed were the outpourings of grief as this news spread throughout the world of the sectarian-orthodox - the charedim, the \"black hat\" Jews of Golders Green (where he lived), Stamford Hill and Gateshead. For Dunner was no ordinary \"black hat\". A rabbi and a reputedly mega-wealthy businessman, this 45-year-old \"ultra-orthodox\" husband and father enjoyed an enviable reputation for charity on a vast scale. </p> <p>\"He redefined our understanding of tzedoko [charity],\" wrote Alex Strom on the front page of the Anglo-Yiddish Jewish Tribune the following Thursday. \"As a father to his children, he will always be the ultimate role model.\" </p> <p>Well, I certainly hope he will not become, in death, \"the ultimate role model\". Neither can I agree with the view of a local councillor in the borough of Barnet that he was \"a true tzaddik [righteous person] in every sense\". Because, quite simply, he wasn't. </p> <p>What emerged at the recent inquest into his death was that Dunner was a cocaine addict. Some time before the crash that killed him he had, according to expert testimony, taken a quantity of this prohibited drug, which, if ingested before driving, is known to result in recklessness, excessive speed and loss of control. The coroner concluded that cocaine had been a factor in his death.</p> <p>Dunner was a deeply troubled individual. It was apparently well known in black-hat circles that he snorted cocaine, the effects of which include a heightened sense of wellbeing and personal confidence. He craved attention - which, perhaps, he purchased through the money that he allegedly gave away. </p> <p>I believe that the criminalisation of drug-taking has been an extremely costly and ill-advised policy. As the recent report of the UK Drug Policy Commission has emphasised, \"despite hundreds of millions of pounds spent each year on UK drug enforcement activity, there is remarkably little evidence of its effectiveness in disrupting markets and reducing availability\". The prohibition of illegal drugs has never succeeded and never will. It should be replaced by legalisation and regulation, which would reduce crime and lead to the disappearance of the murderous cartels that currently control drug supplies worldwide.</p> <p>If Dunner wished to snort cocaine in the privacy of his own home, that was his business and no one else's. If, in so doing, he indulged in self-harm, thus breaching one of the cardinal principles of the faith he professed, that was a matter between him and his maker. If, in so doing, he broke the law of the land, thus breaching another of the cardinal principles of that faith, that also was a matter between him and his maker.</p> <p>These were his private tragedies. The public tragedy is that practically no one among the sectarian-orthodox is prepared to condemn his behaviour. What Dunner did in private was one thing. But in driving under the influence of cocaine he wantonly, publicly, endangered the lives of others. Yet the black-hats seem anxious to excuse such behaviour. He needed to snort cocaine to relieve the stress of his busy lifestyle, one of his acquaintances told me. He took it to counteract headaches, insisted another. </p> <p>Paying tribute to him last March, the chief rabbi, Jonathan Sacks, declared that Dunner was \"an outstanding exemplar of Jewish values and Jewish responsibility\". But the fact of the matter is that Dunner was anything but an exemplar of Jewish values or of Jewish responsibility. Yet no one in a leadership position in Anglo-Jewry is prepared to say so. This is the public tragedy of Dunner's sad life and violent, avoidable death.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Professor Geoffrey Alderman is the author of Modern British Jewry</p>",
  "<p>Days after Russia scored a stunning geopolitical victory in the Caucasus, President Abdullah G\u00fcl of Turkey said he saw a new multipolar world emerging from the wreckage of war.</p> <p>The conflict in Georgia, G\u00fcl asserted, showed that the United States could no longer shape global politics on its own, and should begin sharing power with other countries.</p> <p>\"I don't think you can control all the world from one centre,\" G\u00fcl told the Guardian. \"There are big nations. There are huge populations. There is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world. So what we have to do is, instead of unilateral actions, act all together, make common decisions and have consultations with the world. A new world order, if I can say it, should emerge.\"</p> <p>G\u00fcl, relaxing in a hotel suite with a spectacular view of the glistening Bosphorus, spoke just hours before meeting with the visiting president of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. </p> <p>He rejected the idea, promoted by the United States and Israel, that the best way to deal with Iran was to isolate, sanction and punish it. \"There are so many important issues, like the nuclear issue, Iraq, the Caucasus, Afghanistan,\" he said. \"Iran is definitely having some influence of these issues, so we are talking.\"</p> <p>G\u00fcl said Iran had a right to develop nuclear energy but not nuclear weapons. \"We don't want to see weapons of mass destruction in this region,\" he said. \"If it's in our neighbourhood, we definitely don't want to see it.\"</p> <p>Asked about the possibility of an American attack on Iran, G\u00fcl replied: \"I don't want to think about that. Everybody should take a lesson from what happened in Iraq,\" he said. \"Diplomatic solutions are always better than hard solutions.\"</p> <p>Few countries in the world have changed as dramatically as Turkey over the last decade, and G\u00fcl is among the most intriguing new political leaders to emerge here during that period.</p> <p>When first elected, he seemed to be part of a new Islamic wave that was challenging the entrenched secular elite. He is a practicing Muslim who married his wife when she was 15; she wears the headscarf that some secular Turks consider a badge of reactionary Islam. Yet he and his closest political ally, the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, have led a political revolution that has brought Turkey closer to democracy than any regime in the modern state's 85-year history.</p> <p>G\u00fcl said Turkey could play a decisive role in bridging the chasm that separates the west from more turbulent regions. His country's effort to join the European Union, he said, was its \"main agenda\".</p> <p>\"I wish to see Turkey as an island where the European standard of democracy is being fulfilled and the free market economy is functioning very well,\" he said. \"This will be a real gift to the region, to the world, for peace. And this Turkey will be a source of inspiration for so many.</p> <p>\"As we are transforming ourselves in that direction, we will not forget our natural links and relationships and advantages with other countries - Muslim countries, central Asian countries, Caucasus countries, Middle Eastern and other countries,\" he added, speaking in fluent English. </p> <p>\"Turkey is having a positive impact on them, spreading the values of democracy, freedom, rule of law. Also, the economic changes here ... are admired. Maybe that is the indirect influence of this country.\"</p> <p>For much of this year, political life in Turkey was frozen as the constitutional court considered a prosecutor's charge that the ruling Justice and Development party should be banned because it was a \"focus of anti-secular activity\". Last month the court rejected that argument. </p> <p>Now, G\u00fcl said, Turkey's priority must be to resume its stalled progress towards political reform. \"In the last two years, we spent our energy on domestic issues, and the reforms slowed down,\" he said. \"Now, after the court case, there is a new era. This is a big opportunity for Turkey. Everybody realises that reforms are necessary.\"</p> <p>Some European leaders, G\u00fcl said, fail ed to recognise the contribution that Turkey was making to stability in the world's most volatile region.</p> <p>\"This is a big asset for Europe,\" he said. \"Turkey has great capacity to influence the region, indirectly, very peacefully, being an inspiration for changes. Turkey has been playing this role already. This has not been appreciated enough.\"</p> <p>Opposition to Turkish membership in the EU was for years based on the country's failure to meet democratic standards. More recently, politicians in some European countries have sought votes by bashing Turkey and pledging to keep it out of the EU regardless of its progress toward democracy. These campaigns, G\u00fcl said, harmed Europe's long-term interests.</p> <p>\"Europe should realise that Turkey can do more for the stability and security of the region,\" he said. \"Start with the Caucasus; last month, the problem was not serious, but suddenly we found ourselves in a war situation. </p> <p>\"Europe should encourage Turkey, and not create some artificial problems during the negotiation process with us. Some member countries or some politicians should not mix domestic issues and strategic issues. Domestic issues are conjunctural; today it's there and tomorrow it's not. But the strategic issues are always there, and we cannot sacrifice strategic issues for domestic issues. Unfortunately, nowadays we see this kind of shortsighted policies in some countries.\"</p> <p>G\u00fcl repeatedly returned to the importance of Turkey's democratisation process. He said it would ultimately resolve all of the country's domestic problems, including the long-festering conflict with Kurdish nationalists in south-eastern provinces. \"Some call it terror, some call it the south-east problem, some call it the Kurdish problem - whatever you call it, we will find a solution,\" he said.</p> <p>\"There are other problems - secularism and anti-secularism - those things will also find solutions in this climate. That is why I focus on the reform process. The problem was this: the lack of democracy, the standard of democracy. That was creating problems, not only in the south-east but in other issues. That is when we upgrade the standards, these problems will find solutions.\"</p> <p>With that, G\u00fcl was off to meet Ahmadinejad. \"Our values are different,\" he said with a smile, \"but having a good relationship helps the stability of the region.\"</p>",
  "<p>It was hailed as a heroic operation. Four Royal Marines strapped themselves to the sides of two Apache gunships to recover the body of a dead comrade. Dodging Taliban gunfire, the pilots landed allowing the marines to pick up the body of Lance Corporal Mathew Ford before taking it back across the Helmand river to their base.</p> <p>Yesterday, however, an official report on the circumstances leading to Ford's death revealed he had been killed by one of his own comrades in an operation carried out by poorly trained troops.</p> <p>A devastating board of inquiry report released by the Ministry of Defence exposed a catalogue of errors. The report revealed how a request for more troops by the commander of 3 Commando Brigade was turned down, and how communications became confused as troops struggled to cope with unfamiliar equipment.</p> <p>Amid the gun battle, a marine company commander, a major, was relieved of his post, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>Ford died on January 15 last year during Operation Glacier, an assault on Jugroom Fort, a Taliban base in Garmser, in the south of Helmand province. The idea, says the board of inquiry, was to show that the Nato-led coalition was \"capable of operating anywhere it chose\". However, \"shortfalls in combat power\", identified by the brigade commander whose request to London for more troops was refused, prevented British forces from succeeding, specifically in being able to \"take and subsequently hold\" ground, the report says.</p> <p>Training was geared too much towards old-fashioned peacekeeping operations. The commando brigade \"was forced to adapt to a fast-moving operational environment quite different to that for which they had trained ... lessons were learned the hard way\", says the report. </p> <p>\"A lack of mutual understanding was exacerbated by the turnover of key staff,\" it adds.</p> <p>As Operation Glacier began, Z Company, from 45 Commando, gathered close to the fort. They attacked shortly after dawn, storming across the river in a convoy of Viking amphibious vehicles. Apache gunships and armoured vehicles. Troops made for the fort walls, jumped out of the armoured track vehicles, and started a ground assault. It was then that things started to go badly wrong.</p> <p>There was tension and strained relations between the commander and more junior officers in a new force structure \"facing a task for which it was not originally designed\". The problems were compounded by \"a great deal of confusion, exacerbated by the weight of fire from multiple locations\".</p> <p>Amid all this, a machine gunner on one of the Vikings opened fire. \"Thinking he had seen a muzzle flash [he] swung his weapon round almost 180 degrees and opened fire in the direction of the flash. Almost immediately the troops ... began shouting at him to stop firing towards the wall, as did his driver.\"</p> <p>The board of inquiry notes that the machine gunner's briefing \"had been hurried, that he was disorientated and that actions were spontaneous on witnessing what he believed to be enemy fire\".</p> <p>Four marines were evacuated. A head count revealed that the 30-year-old Ford was missing. An Apache pilot reported seeing a heat source by the wall of the fort. Ford was found with wounds to his head and chest.</p> <p>\"In hindsight, it is highly likely that L/Cpl Ford had already - instantaneously - died from his wounds,\" the report concludes. Both of his wounds, it adds, \"were very probably caused by Nato rounds\".</p> <p>His fellow marines and the Apache's army pilots agreed that the quickest and least risky way of getting him out was by strapping him to a helicopter. This, they achieved, as a US plane dropped three bombs to distract the enemy.</p> <p>The board of inquiry does not explicitly apportion blame and no disciplinary action has been taken. </p> <p>Major General Jerry Thomas, commander of 3 Commando Brigade at the time, said yesterday: \"If I did not think we were ready to deploy and if I did not believe in the ability of my people to conduct this operation successfully, I would not have allowed them to go. Although there was risk in mounting this offensive, the decision was made after a careful judgment, accepting that, while risk can be minimised, it can never be removed entirely. </p> <p>\"While the death of Lance Corporal Ford was a tragic incident, the courage and professionalism of those men that recovered his body was exemplary and in the best traditions of the UK's armed forces. </p> <p>Bob Ainsworth, the armed forces minister told the BBC: \"It is not the case that the brigade involved was under-prepared or under-resourced.

The girl always smiles and the boy is very well mannered,\" wrote one poster, in Chinese. \"My friend told me they were planning to return back to China, getting married and start a small business,\" said another.</p> <p>One poster said they had gone to college with Zhen Xing in Cornwall. \"The deceased man was my classmate in my language class, he's pretty clever and tall ... too sad ... He is a very good cook,\" they wrote. Yesterday Cornwall College St Austell confirmed that Zhen Xing had studied international English there between 2003 and 2004 as an adult student, but failed to pass the course.</p> <p>And as for the cat, a postmortem concluded that it had been drowned at around the same time as the murders were committed. Police are investigating whether killing a cat had any cultural significance in Chinese culture and whether cats were thought to be lucky.</p> <p>But this theory was pooh-poohed in Newcastle this week, where, according to the North East Chinese Association, the Chinese population is 6,000-7,000 strong (including 2,000 students). One Chinese man who has lived in Newcastle for 20 years, said: \"Killing a cat has no meaning in Chinese culture at all. If they had had a dog, they probably would have killed that. It's simply a warning sign.\"</p> <p>Forensic experts were yesterday conducting tests on the cat to see if any DNA was in the cat's claws that could provide a clue as to the killer.</p> <p>The Chinese community in Newcastle was buzzing with rumours about the murder this week. All along the restaurant-packed Stowell Street, the main thoroughfare of the city's Chinatown, locals huddled around discussing the case in doorways, in Mandarin and Cantonese.</p> <p>Though the police say they have ruled out any Triad link, many Chinese people are not so sure. \"The way in which they were killed was so ruthless, that I think it must have been a professional,\" said one.</p> <p>But others said the Triad was very weak in Newcastle. \"We have some Triad, but compared to other big cities such as Manchester, they're third division,\" said Eddy Tang. \"People here are involved mostly for the recreational side.\"</p>",
  "<p>In a very good foreword to this book, Steve Redgrave elegantly highlights the difference between the Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race and an Olympic six-boat final. \"In the Boat Race there are no silver medals,\" he says. \"There is no second place - you win or you lose.\" When I was coaching Oxford crews in the 70s and 80s, I underscored that same point in my pre-race briefing: \"This 20-minute race will define you for the rest of your lives - win or lose.\" </p> <p>There is little difference between preparing crews for the Olympics or for the Boat Race, which is the only university sporting event that produces international-class athletes capable of walking straight into national teams, and crews that can often match most Olympic eights for speed. The Boat Race athletes are preparing for a 4\u00bc mile race in the spring, while the Olympians race over 2,000 metres in the summer, but the basic training is the same for both. </p> <p>A third of any British men's rowing team is usually composed of former Boat Race athletes, so the standard is very high. In Beijing this weekend, where I will be commentating for BBC television, there will be nine Oxbridge rowers - seven British, a Canadian and a Croatian. Three of the women's team raced in the women's Boat Race. Sponsorship and lottery support have made a big difference to the athletes in the national team, though the Boat Race itself provides no financial benefit. So rowers can indeed claim to be the last amateurs.</p> <p>Mark de Rond, an Oxford-educated ethnographer teaching in Cambridge, sets out to live and breathe the lives of the exceptional and dedicated rowers of the 2007 Cambridge crew in their six months preparing for the varsity contest. As a stranger both to these particular athletes and to high-octane sport in general, it is a difficult balancing act. His mission is two-fold: to chart the minutiae of their journeys as people, and to examine and analyse them in scientific terms - their motives, the chemistry and relationships between them, their personal tragedies and triumphs.</p> <p>It is an ambitious project that sucks him further and further into events and the personal lives of his subjects, to the detriment of any clear conclusions. Ultimately, he \"goes native\" - eschewing his scientific project, his purpose. \"Little do I realise that my experience as ethnographer will prove among the least useful,\" he writes, \"and that my survival within the squad will come to hinge critically on my skills in conflict resolution.\" The other surprise discovery he makes is that he comes to see in the athletes \"everything that I am not: virility, masculinity, youth, beauty, foolishness\". </p> <p>In the early chapters, he convincingly describes and examines what drives this elite and reclusive group of men to endure the hardship and sacrifice of the most intense competitive pressure. He gives intelligent and thoughtful voice to the essentials that make up the 180-year-old Boat Race experience.</p> <p>The scenes he describes are very familiar to me, as someone involved for over 40 years as an Oxford Boat Race athlete, coach and now adviser. Oxford and Cambridge are mirrors of each other, absolute partners and rivals for almost every step of the way. The internal battles for selection, friend against friend; the disappointments; the training-camp existence; the personalities - all are perfectly matched by the opposition.</p> <p>De Rond captures well the fragile egotism that is an essential part of any top-class athlete's psychological makeup; their single-mindedness and selfishness during selection battling uncomfortably with their desire for comradeship and team-building. As the unsuccessful athletes fall by the wayside, the successful ones huddle together until finally the chosen eight crew members and cox emerge, heads held high. It is the perfect team sport - but only after 20 or so others have been cast aside.</p> <p>Though he is an \"outsider\" who has never \"done it\", De Rond succeeds in conjuring up the lives of athletes in extremis, under constant pressure to perform - and study. There are good descriptions of the intense rivalry of two 6ft 8in world champions vying for the right to sit in the important stroke seat and lead the crew. The detail of the selection processes is generally meticulous, but there is one glaring gap in the narrative as a key selection battle looms and a discarded oarsman prepares to fight back to regain a place in the boat. There is, unexpectedly, no chronicling of what would have been an absorbing drama. His name simply appears in the final line-up. </p> <p>De Rond also offers a stream of literary and artistic references, drawing on Shakespeare, Conrad, Larkin, Orwell, Kipling, Kerouac, Coleridge, Bellow, Malinowski, Cecil Beaton and David Lodge to illuminate his story. These sit well with the extended monologues and emails of the athletes as they seek to analyse their emotions and ambitions. </p> <p>The Cambridge crew included five world and Olympic medallists - three of them gold - making them the most star-studded eight to grace the Boat Race in many years. For an Oxford supporter it was a surprise - and a source of some considerable pride - that Cambridge eventually won by barely more than one length, after 4\u00bc miles of gruelling racing against gallant and defiant rivals lacking such heady credentials. The explanation for this apparent underperformance is found in part in the pages of The Last Amateurs</p> <p>De Rond manages to give himself something of a leading role in the story, by writing in the first person, which gets a little irritating (and confusing for a non-rower). He also emerges as a mediator in some of the heated selection debates between the coaching team and the highly strung athletes. At times he is even called upon to help resolve disputes, on one occasion being handed responsibility by the coach for chairing a critical meeting.</p> <p>But there is a Zelig quality that pervades The Last Amateurs. De Rond insinuates himself more and more into the story, relating his dreams, what he, \"the boys\" and Rebecca the cox had for breakfast, and even details of his bodily functions that many reader might prefer not to know. His pre-race nerves are at one point so out of control that he has to be calmed down by the coach.</p> <p>But there is a lot about this particular Boat Race story that failed to make the final cut. One jarring omission is the fact that, after the event, it emerged that the strongest and most vital crew member was ineligible to compete since he had not completed his academic course at Cambridge; he left as soon as the race was over to join the German national team, in violation of one of the few rules of this amateur event - that the competitors are bona fide members of the university. </p> <p>There was also considerable fallout that might have provided a rich source of material for De Rond the ethnographer. One athlete, championed by his team-mates on the grounds of personality - a scenario I recognise from my own coaching experience - was selected despite the coach's decision to exclude him. The coach, his authority severely undermined by his perceived capitulation to his crew's demands, did not have his contract renewed after just three years in the job. And neither of the German superstars who returned to the national eight will be appearing in Beijing this weekend: they were dropped from their Olympic team earlier this year. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Daniel Topolski's True Blue: The Oxford Boat Race Mutiny is published by Bantam</p>",
  "<p>Anyone harbouring the thought that Midnight's Children is a novel nowadays more often honoured than actually read would have received some counter-evidence when its author came to talk about it at the Guardian book club. The 500 or so who packed in to the Shaw theatre in London gave Salman Rushdie the warm reception you would expect, as, when invited to ask questions, they showed a rather close knowledge of the text. Episodes were described and lines quoted. The reader who was interested in the book's use of cinema was able to cite its buried allusions to The Wizard of Oz and name the specific Bollywood blockbusters that it recalled. The reader who commented on the reappearance of characters from Midnight's Children in some of Rushdie's later novels gave chapter and verse on this, reminding the novelist himself of examples that might have slipped his mind. </p> <p>Much attention was also paid to the manner of the book's narration. The first question of the evening was about the importance to the novelist of a self-conscious narrator, aware that he is not just telling but \"constantly revising\" his own story, his mistress heckling him \"over his shoulder\". The technique - the narrative recapitulations and reinterpretations and proleptic leaps forward - was intended, Rushdie said, to give the reader some sense of control over the material. (Padma, the narrator's grumbling consort, was the reader's representative.) The illusion of readerly control required much rewriting of his text after it was nominally finished. Amina's visit to the fortune teller early in the book - he \"essentially tells her the plot of the novel\" - therefore had to be \"one of the last paragraphs I wrote\".</p> <p>Rushdie confirmed that he felt free to indulge this sense of play because he had no assumptions about reaching any readership. He had been able to experiment because he had had no readers to lose. One member of the audience felt that this playfulness waned in the third part of the novel, and that Saleem became \"a diminished figure\" as the novelist began to take on the politics of India under Mrs Gandhi. Rushdie was rueful about his reader's disappointment (\"the best part is the early part\", this reader told him) but agreed that as Saleem became older he was more and more often \"crushed by events\". \"To tell you the truth it annoyed me about him\" - but that was the logic of his story.</p> <p>Some members of the audience had perhaps been studying the novel as well as reading it. \"To what extent were you trying to rebel against traditional literary form?\" The reader who asked this likened Midnight's Children to Virginia Woolf's Orlando, in which expectations of a personal narrative are &lt;a \"bent\" to allow it to include pieces of history. Rushdie relished the analogy, but confessed that he had not read Woolf's novel at the time he wrote Midnight's Children. Neither, he told another reader, was he as conscious of One Hundred Years of Solitude as his readers assumed (though his account of the differences between his novel and M\u00e1rquez's showed a close knowledge of the latter). He had been much more aware of G\u00fcnter Grass's The Tin Drum as a precedent.</p> <p>Rushdie's response to the idea of himself as a fictional \"rebel\" produced one of the most interesting discussions of the evening, in which he talked of writing against the version of India learned from EM Forster's A Passage to India (which he called \"a brave and brilliant book\"), yet \"fondly\" recalled meetings with Forster as a student at King's College, Cambridge. Forster's fiction was \"cool\", and \"India is hot\". He had thought that the very \"quality of Forster's language\" was somehow wrong for the country. Above all, what he had been trying to do was to make a language for a hot and crowded country. Questioned about the novel's relationship to Indian languages, he said that he wanted to make its English feel unEnglish - specifically, to make it seem like Hindi.</p> <p>Finally, there was the controversial historical material that Saleem wove into his autobiographical narrative. In a discussion of the representation of India and its history in Midnight's Children, questions about \"optimism\" or \"pessimism\" were never far away. One Indian reader asked him directly, \"Do you have any optimistic vision of India's future?\" In response, Rushdie cited JK Galbraith's description of India as \"functioning anarchy\". \"When you go there you don't feel that people despair.\" The novelist had confessed that, while he was writing the novel, he had found himself waiting for the end of Mrs Gandhi's Emergency so that he would not have to conclude his story with a modern \"Midnight\" (the title of his penultimate chapter). \"It's a book with an optimistic ending.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Mullan is professor of English at University College London.

  "<p>Steve McClaren has finally proved himself a great success - on YouTube. McClaren's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l9BFJYiPxA\">mastery of the Dutch language</a>, after only five weeks as FC Twente manager, had, by yesterday evening, already garnered more than 200,000 hits.</p> <p>Here he is talking to an English-speaking journalist for Dutch TV shortly before Twente met Arsenal in the Champions League. \"I sort of knew when I came eer - ze Liverpool or Arshenal, one of zem we would draw. We have a young team and to expereinsh bigggggg games [he holds out his hands in a manner common to footballers denoting a particularly large pair of breasts] Championsh Leeegue, at home, ze Emirates, will be fantasteeec for ze playez.\"</p> <p>Then McClaren gets into his stride. \"I shay I think we are not just - what you call? - Underdogsh, but masheev underdogsh. There is no expectashun.\"</p> <p>At first, I assumed it was a cruel dubbing joke. No man, not even an English footballer manager, could speak such ridiculous 'Allo 'Allo Dutch. But, sure enough, a source close to McClaren has confirmed this is no laughing matter. He was being deadly serious.</p> <p>It's classic McClaren. Smiling beautifully, so eager to please, so desperate to get it right, and the Wally with the Brolly who failed to get England to the European Championship finals, gets it all so wrong again. Poor Steve.</p> <p>Do foreign footballers and managers come here and do the same - speak their language in a cod English accent to try to fool the natives? Because we are monolingual philistines, most of us wouldn't have a clue if Big Phil Scolari was speaking Portuguese in Mockney, or if Fabio Capello was chatting away about Michael Owen's prospects in cod-Scouse Italian.</p> <p>But the evidence suggests they don't. In his first press conference, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho managed to show off his Messiah complex in almost perfect English. \"Please don't call me arrogant, but I'm European champion and I think I'm a special one.\" Meanwhile, in his first public outing when asked if he was also special, Scolari revealed an easy charm. \"Yes, I am special for my friends, my family, my country ... but as a manager, so-so.\"</p> <p>McClaren was never going to be as cool as Mourinho or Scolari, but has done us all a service - he has highlighted a very British condition: silly accent syndrome. As we British tend not to learn languages because we are lazy and we don't have to, we cover our failings by attempting to imitate what we think the language in question sounds like - like a parrot, but with less skill and ambition. Silly accent syndrome is getting more and more common as fewer and fewer of us learn foreign languages - the percentage of pupils taking a foreign language GCSE in England fell from 78% in 2001 to 48% last year.</p> <p>Professor Susan Hunston, chair of the British Association for Applied Linguistics, listened to McClaren and confirmed that he does indeed have accent issues. \"The speed is slower, there is an imitation of phonological features, he raises his voice at the end of sentences to check he's understood, he's giving equal stress to each word. This is classical Trying-to-Make-Yourself-Understood-to-a-Foreigner English. It's typical of the way English people compensate for the lack of foreign language ability.\"</p> <p>Hunston says McClaren could be a working example of what linguists call accommodation theory - if you like somebody, or a nation, you subconsciously change the way you speak to sound like them. \"Ten out of 10 for effort, but there is a way of speaking slowly and clearly that doesn't make it sound as if you're treating them like idiots.\"</p> <p>Still, at least McClaren is trying. When Ian Rush returned from playing for Juventus, disillusioned and less than fluent in the language, he is alleged to have said: \"I couldn't settle in Italy - it was like living in a foreign country.\"</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:simon.hattenstone@theguardian.com\">simon.hattenstone@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>For the third time in consecutive home fixtures, Lancashire escaped with a draw from a match in which they had been second best by a distance, and so they remain in improbable and deeply unimpressive title contention - closing to within 14 points of the leaders, Nottinghamshire, with a game in hand.</p> <p>In contrast, Yorkshire have merely scraped out of the relegation zone despite an admirable all-round performance in which they claimed 12 points, the maximum number available for a draw, but failed to push for a much-needed victory with any adventure or conviction yesterday. After resuming on 234 for two, they added 121 from 33 overs in the morning session and then batted on after lunch, rather than declaring in an effort to expose Lancashire's fragile batting confidence.</p> <p>When Darren Gough did finally call his batsmen in more than 10 overs later, immediately after the fifth batting point had been secured, such conservative tactics briefly promised to pay off as Lancashire slipped to 29 for three. The victims included Stuart Law, caught by Gough off a leading edge from the bowling of Tim Bresnan, and Iain Sutcliffe, in his last first-class innings after the former Leicestershire opener decided during this match to retire at the age of 33 with immediate effect.</p> <p>But Yorkshire's threat diminished from the moment Gough withdrew Matthew Hoggard after only four overs - even though he had Sutcliffe caught behind in his first - and replaced him with the very occasional leg spin of the former South Africa international Jacques Rudolph. </p> <p>Paul Horton and Lou Vincent deserved credit for the skill with which they stifled the leg-spin of Adil Rashid on a pitch offering generous turn and occasional bounce, but when a draw was agreed in fading light with an hour or so remaining, Yorkshire were surely regretting an opportunity lost.</p>",
  "<p>On the table in Sir Hugh Orde's office at the Belfast headquarters of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) is a copy of Douglas Hurd's biog raphy of Sir Robert Peel. Could there be a more apposite book than one about the man who gave us the word \"bobby\" and whose time in the 19th century as chief secretary of Ireland still arouses strong emotions there?</p> <p>Orde is being talked up as a potential successor to the embattled Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, just as his own PSNI officers are being targeted by dissident Republican paramilitaries in what is seen as the greatest security threat there in a decade. </p> <p>\"What you see here at the moment is the communities moving forward and that is unstoppable ... We know [paramilitaries] are still trying to recruit; some of those we are arresting are young people who would have no notion of what it was like in the troubles - the 'glorious days of revolution' that never existed stuff - and people who are pretty unbalanced and dysfunctional. But they are dangerous ... we know they are determined to attack and kill police and we have been lucky, frankly.\" </p> <p>Famously a long-distance runner - \"I am getting slower and slower\" - and a fan of Bruce Springsteen and Leonard Cohen, Orde, who turns 50 on August 27, holds one of the most senior positions in the police and may be on the brink of the top job. Originally from Haslemere in Surrey, he wanted to be a farmer but joined the Met instead in 1977. This was a time when a \"Life on Mars\" police culture still thrived. He can recall being a young cop at Rochester Row station, where the sergeant would leave a police helmet on the front desk and hide if a member of the public came in, turn the lights on and off and intone, Dalek-like: \"This is an automatic police station, state your business.\" </p> <p>Orde shakes his head at the memory, saying: \"Some poor victim would have a conversation with a police helmet.\"</p> <p> Orde went to Northern Ireland as part of the Stevens inquiry into the links between the security services and Loyalist paramilitaries. Was he surprised at the level of collusion? \"Collusion, the C-word. First, we have to be clear there was, without doubt, collusion, in some cases between security services and the paramilitaries ... Was it endemic? No, it was not. Was it institutionalised? No, it was not. That doesn't mean it didn't happen.\" </p> <p>That Chris Patten, chairman of the independent commission on policing for Northern Ireland from 1998-99, allowed people to \"leave with dignity, at huge cost to my organisation in terms of experience, was critical\", Orde says, referring to 3,360 officers who have since left under the Patten plan, partly as a result of the decision to cut police numbers. \"It did give people an opportunity to move away, if they didn't want to be part of a new world.\"</p> <p> His answer may be an indication of the tightrope he still has to walks since becoming chief constable of the PSNI in 2002 - even in the \"new world\". While Orde has to acknowledge what happened in the past, he needs to do so without, as he sees it, alienating the people whose support he needs in the new, post-RUC police service. \"Generally speaking, in Britain, senior leaders of the police service are pretty anonymous,\" says Orde. \"Here, it is totally different and I misjudged that badly ... everything the police did was interpreted in a political way and in directly opposing ways by different sides.\" </p> <p>He also found his job has taken him to the US. \"The obsession with Northern Ireland - and particularly policing - on the east coast of America was something we identified very quickly as needing to be dealt with. Was that police business? I would argue that it was. The work we did in the States for the last six years has been unravelling 35 years of a very one-dimensional interpretation of policing, the Republican agenda, and turning that into an accurate description of what policing actually was.\" </p> <p>He has spoken to Hillary Clinton as well as George Bush, who he visits \"once a year to tell him about policing and that it's working. It's not the content of the conversation that's important but that the conversation that takes place.\"</p> <p>But whoever takes over from Blair will have a different terrorist threat to worry about and Orde defends what he said to the Guardian this year, that one day we may need to talk to al-Qaida.</p> <p>\"I got flak last week for speaking to the representatives of [loyalist paramilitaries] the UDA,\" he says, before asking whether I had read what was said about him by Lord Maginnis - the former Ulster Unionist party's security spokesman described Orde's actions as \"unbridled arrogance and patently idiotic\". \"Wow, he hates me with a vengeance. I have a very basic benchmark: I will talk to anyone who wants to make a contribution to policing,\" he says, adding that he initially faced criticisms for talking to leading Republicans. \"I fully understood that it would be deeply offensive at the time to talk to some of the people I spoke to but it was the right thing to do because it moved the world on.\"</p> <p>Orde warms to his theme, explaining that had the Edward Heath government's clandestine talks with the IRA been made public the outrage would have been enormous.</p> <p>\"When I first met them, I put an email out saying, 'Here's what I'm doing and here's why I'm doing it.' Most cops with a lot of service said: 'Good luck; if this means my kids don't have to go through what I went through, I'm all for it'.\" </p> <p>Gesturing at the crowded bookcases, Orde says he has \"learned more from eating fish and chips\" with David Ervine, the late former leader of the Progressive Unionist party and a one-time paramilitary, about \"working-class loyalism\" than reading any of those books. At some stage, there will come a point when speaking to the unspeakable will happen and the role of the police is to create the conditions where people realise this [terrorism] ain't going to work.\" </p> <p>What he was also trying to suggest earlier this year, he says, was a way of diverting would-be terrorists. \"The point was - an awful lot of people who are so-called al-Qaida are actually radicalised, young, disenfranchised British. The more you can get into those communities and build confidence in them, the more chances you have of making them see the crazy way they're going.\"</p> <p>Orde supported extending the detention without charge for terror suspects to 28 days. But he says the argument over whether the time limit is seven or 28 or 42 or 90 is \"completely sterile\". </p> <p>\"What we must have is a system in place pre-event because all the lessons from knee-jerk legislation, from the dangerous dogs act onwards, is that you get something unworkable, chaotic and probably more Draconian. </p> <p>\"My fear is that, in the absence of proper legislation ... the temptation will be to charge people early, to take risks and it will fall apart 10, 20 years down the line.\" </p> <p>The decision to extend the detention time of a terror suspect should be left to a senior judge, he says, rather than to an arbitrary time limit, as \"if that means, on day 28 and one second, someone who I suspect deeply of a huge outrage, that I cannot charge them with, will walk out the door, society will have to judge government on that, not me.\"</p> <p>It was in the wake of the July 2005 London bombings that Jean Charles de Menezes was shot, and next month's inquest may yet force Blair out of the job he has refused to relinquish. Does Orde sympathise with the Met commissioner? </p> <p>\"My basic point has always been if you can't take the heat don't apply for the job, but these are hugely challenging events, which is where leadership is always tested ... If you take a senior position, expect to be under the spotlight. That's the world we live in.\"</p> <p>Last year it emerged that Orde, who was married at the time, and a then undercover officer, Denise Weston, had had a child. They are now officially a couple, but the relationship attracted hostile comment in the press. </p> <p>\"It was tiresome and hurtful at the time but I have no difficulty with a journalist making observations about my personal life, provided they're accurate,\" he says. More damagingly, he was accused in the press of taking a family member on a paid-for trip abroad. He is now suing for libel and is confident of success. </p> <p>\"When someone says something that goes to the heart of my integrity around money, which is a downright lie, I think you have no option [but to sue], when they refuse to retract it. But you've got to live with what people write.\"</p> <p>So, what about that job at the Met? \"Help, Liz!\" he calls out to his press officer before saying he has agreed to stay at the PSNI until 2010: \"It is a great privilege to run this organisation and I have no plans at all to move at the moment. But one day?\"</p>",
  "<p>The chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland has been briefing President Bush and other senior US politicians to assure them that the peace process remains on track. Details of a series of meetings have emerged as dissident Republican groups stepped up their efforts to kill police officers, in what is seen as an attempt to derail the power-sharing agreement.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Sir Hugh Orde described how a key part of the power-sharing strategy has been to persuade senior politicians in the United States that policing was being conducted in a fair and even-handed way.</p> <p>\"The work we did in the States for the past six years has been unravelling 35 years of a very one-dimensional interpretation of policing,\" said Sir Hugh, who took over his current post in 2002.

He has accused the new wave of paramilitaries of being \"out of touch and out of time\".</p> <p>He described the latest wave of attacks as being the work of very young recruits with no first-hand memories of the troubles in the country and others who were \"pretty unbalanced and dysfunctional\". \"But they are dangerous,\" he added, \"and if my alarm clock goes off in the morning, it means we haven't lost an officer overnight.\" </p> <p>Orde is seen as a potential successor to Sir Ian Blair as commissioner of the Metropolitan police. When asked if he had sympathy for Sir Ian, who has faced criticism over his handling of the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, an inquest into which will be held next month, Orde said: \"My basic point has always been, if you can't take the heat don't apply for the job.

  "<p>For many American commentators, plucky little Georgia has been the victim of Russian imperialism. The Guardian's Seumas Milne takes an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/14/russia.georgia\"> equally simplistic view</a>: Russia is blameless for a war caused by US \"expansion\". Both schools of thought agree that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> has been the conflict's big winner. In the long run, I am not so sure. Russia has much more to lose from a period of frosty relations with the west than either the Americans or the Europeans.</p> <p>Russia's Achilles heel is its economy. This has been growing fast, at over 7% a year. Wealth has spread out from the energy companies and the government, helping to create a prosperous middle class. But the economy remains dangerously dependent on energy and raw materials. Russia has very few high-tech industries, its record on innovation is appalling, it has too few small and medium-sized companies and its service industries are backward.</p> <p>President Dmitry Medvedev and his advisers, who have close links with many business leaders, understand that Russia needs to diversify, and that autarkic policies will make that harder. More foreign investment in Russia would help to produce the kind of broad-based economy that China enjoys. The leading Russian companies want to emulate western multinationals by taking over foreign firms, raising money on international capital markets and hiring the best talent. But if Russia makes life difficult for foreign investors, its own companies will find doors closing against them.</p> <p>Even Russia's oil and gas companies, whose output is beginning to decline, cannot thrive without foreign technology, expertise and capital. Although profitable, they lack the financial muscle that would enable them to invest in major exploration projects or overseas acquisitions without the help of foreign bank loans. </p> <p>On a recent visit to Moscow I was struck by widening divisions within the Russian elite. Business leaders have become much more critical of Vladimir Putin - occasionally in public - than they were six months ago. That is hardly surprising, given the impact of Putin's policies and comments on business confidence and the stockmarket. His personal attack on the leadership of Mechel, a leading steelmaker, hit share prices badly, as did the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">assault on Georgia</a>. The market had already been unsettled by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/05/bp.oilandgascompanies\">fight</a> between BP and AAR for control of TNK-BP. The fact that several state agencies have intervened on AAR's side may - Russian businessmen are well aware - deter some potential foreign investors.</p> <p>Many Russian business leaders worry that Putinism - and especially its anti-western foreign policy - will in the long run damage the economy. Some senior figures in the security establishment seem oblivious to the economic consequences of their actions. Putin's and Medvedev's advisers have started to spar in public. Putin, of course, is still in charge for now, but Medvedev's clan and its allies in the business world are not without influence.</p> <p>China's leadership is pursuing a long-term strategy of not alienating the US while the Chinese economy grows big and strong. Russia's leaders are making a mistake in choosing a different strategy. Although US power is in relative decline, it will remain the world's most powerful country for many years. The war in Georgia has transformed the way Americans view Russia. Until now George Bush's genuinely warm relationship with Putin has prevented a tougher US policy from emerging. But whoever wins the presidential election, US policy on Russia will harden. For many years Russia's leaders have assumed that the US intends to encircle, weaken and dismember their country. That paranoia, largely built on fantasy, will now become more real.</p> <p>The US will step up efforts to thwart Russia in its near abroad, prevent sensitive technologies from reaching the country and curb the international aspirations of Russian companies. Although John McCain's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/11/johnmccain.barackobama\">scheme</a> to exclude Russia from the G8 is impractical, the G7 - which still exists for economic policy, and excludes Russia - will take on a larger and a more political role. </p> <p>Since the US trades very little with Russia, it can afford to take act tough. The Europeans, some of whom depend on Russian energy, cannot. The EU will remain divided between those who want to confront Russia and those who prefer a soft touch. But events in Georgia have shifted the centre of gravity of the European debate in a more critical direction. German public opinion, with its pacifist tendencies, has been shocked to see Russian tanks and warplanes in action. A few days before the fighting broke out, I met a German banker who works a lot in Russia and sits on the boards of several Russian companies. He normally defends Putin from all criticism. But on this occasion he told me that Russia's leaders had become so arrogant and greedy that he feared they would make serious mistakes. If Putinism continues on its current course, Russia risks alienating Germany, its best friend in Europe.</p> <p>The EU cannot do much to 'punish' Russia. If it blocked Russia from WTO membership, or stopped the talks on a new partnership and co-operation agreement, it would damage the moderates within the Russian system. But the EU could - and in the long run probably will - do two things. The first, as my colleague Tomas Valasek argues in <a href=\"http://www.cer.org.uk/pdf/briefing_georgia_15aug08_tv.pdf \">a recent CER policy brief</a>, is to strengthen ties with countries in the common neighbourhood. The EU should offer more trade and aid, encourage them to take part in many of its policies, and hold out the long-term prospect of membership, when they are ready. The second is to make clear to Moscow that the EU has a red line: if Russia tried to take over sovereign and independent states in the common neighbourhood, it would pay a price. The EU cannot and would not stop trading with Russia. But it could cut off political contacts, make it harder for some kinds of Russian to get visas, and discourage Russian businesses from entering the EU.</p> <p>Plenty of senior Russians are concerned at the prospect of a new Cold War, partly because of growing worries about China. Superficially, Russia's and China's leaders get on well, often teaming up against the west at the UN. But the Chinese, focused on the US, do not take Russia and its economy very seriously. The Russians are aware of relative strengths of their economies (in 2030, according to the <a href=\"http://http://www.cer.org.uk/pdf/p_837.pdf\">Economist Intelligence Unit</a>, China will make up 22.7% of world GDP, against Russia's 2.7%. They also fear Chinese encroachment into Russia's under-populated Asian territories.</p> <p>Throughout its history, Russia has had a poor record of making friends with its neighbours. In the multipolar world that is emerging, the country will be too weak - diplomatically and economically - to flourish on its own. It will need allies. Medvedev's people understand that splendid isolation offers no future for Russia.</p>",

  "<p>With the July terrorist attack on the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7492601.stm\">Indian embassy in Kabul</a> \u2013 which left 41 dead and the finger of suspicion pointing at the Pakistani intelligence services \u2013 the world was again reminded why the Indian subcontinent has eclipsed the Middle East as the world's flash-point. </p> <p>Both American presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, have made clear that they expect the Pakistani government to take action against militants, and that they would be willing to authorise strikes inside Pakistan. But a more comprehensive Euro-Atlantic approach will be required to deal with the region's problems. </p> <p>The story of western failure in Afghanistan is now all too familiar, painfully illustrated, almost weekly, by the repatriation of <a href=\"http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=82b44aed-713c-4b5f-b408-a29b1b215b03\">fallen Nato soldiers</a>. But the story is repeated across the border in Pakistan, with serious consequences for both countries. </p> <p>The optimism that followed the recent <a href=\"http://www.elections.com.pk/\">Pakistani elections</a> has turned to concern as the government's negotiations with militants appear to have made a terrorist safe-haven safer and attacks against Nato forces in Afghanistan <a href=\"http://www.ecfr.eu/content/entry/commentary_drafting_a_new_afghan_pakistan_strategy/\">more frequent</a>. Pakistan's military and intelligence services are sympathetic to an Islamic fundamentalist creed, militant groups affiliated with al-Qaida operate freely on its territory, and government infighting has made it difficult to establish civilian control over the military. </p> <p>In any case, the ability of the Pakistani military to deal with the current threat, let alone a widespread insurgency, is questionable, as is western leverage on Pakistan's security forces. As a result, loss of control of parts of Pakistan to an increasingly capable alliance of militant groups is a serious near-term threat. </p> <p>If American policy has failed to deal with this growing problem, European policy has focused on technical assistance, with the European Union providing <a href=\"http://www.theparliament.com/policy-focus/foreign-affairs/foreign-affairs-article/newsarticle/eu-presses-musharraf-for-pledge-on-free-and-fair-elections/\">\u20ac125m in aid</a> between 2002 and 2006. Moreover, Europe is Pakistan's <a href=\"http://www.mfa.gov.pk/Spokesperson/2008/Jan/Spokes_16_01_08.htm\">largest trading partner</a>, accounting for 27.4% of total exports and 17% of imports. In 2005 alone, EU imports from Pakistan totaled \u20ac3.4bn. </p> <p>Yet, despite this, it is hard to escape the conclusion that the EU's role in Pakistan bears all the hallmarks of the pre-Maastricht polity that it no longer wants to be: technocratic, apolitical, and marginalised by the United States. </p> <p>This needs to change. The US, even under a new president, cannot succeed in the region without a united front with Europe. And Europe cannot hope to achieve its aims with technical programs alone. </p> <p>To create a framework for US-European cooperation, work needs to begin now. Several reports that will influence the McCain and Obama campaigns are already being written in Washington. But none of these will be able to chart a way forward for transatlantic cooperation. Moreover, they risk repeating the standard pattern of US-European cooperation: the US as the policy developer and Europe as the apolitical and hesitant money-spender. </p> <p>Genuine transatlantic cooperation will require that solutions be developed jointly, and that European leaders \"own\" the policy options. Otherwise, European governments will find it difficult to explain the need to step up efforts in the region, and the European Commission's technical programmes will continue to define the EU's policy. </p> <p>To build the necessary unity and a political strategy, a European Baker-Hamilton-style commission is necessary. Such a commission, with senior European members, could examine the key issues in the region, visit all countries and players and develop a set of recommendations for a new transatlantic approach to begin in early January 2009 when a new US president is in place. </p> <p>And who better to launch this than Nicolas Sarkozy? The French president has already played a crucial role in bridging the US/European divide on the <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1725866,00.html\">Afghan mission</a> and \u2013 after a successful donor's conference \u2013 has taken the help of the EU's rotating, six-month presidency. </p> <p>Ideally, such a commission should be independent, but endorsed by the French, German and British governments and EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, as well as, however tacitly, Senators McCain and Obama. </p> <p>Everyone knows of the dangers posed by instability on the Afghan-Pakistan border, in Pakistan and the region. In July, Pakistani and Indian soldiers waged a 12-hour gun battle across their disputed border. But so far, little has been done to develop the kind of Euro-Atlantic consensus about policy options necessary for a new US president and Europe to collaborate. </p> <p>Worse still, the rejection by Ireland of the Lisbon treaty threatens to push the issue further back in the queue. But European leaders must not take their eyes off real-world problems and drafting a new Euro-Atlantic policy on Afghanistan and Pakistan is as real as it gets.</p> <p><em>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>/European Council on Foreign Relations, 2008</em></p>",
  "<p>It was a bit like telling a rape victim to stop struggling. Peter van Walsum, the Dutch diplomat who is the UN representative to Western Sahara, <a href=\"http://w-sahara.blogspot.com/2008/08/new-van-walsum-interview.html\">told the Spanish newspaper El Pais</a> that Western Sahara will never achieve independence, even though he admitted that international law and successive UN resolutions have called for self determination in <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/wi.html\">the vast desert country</a> mostly occupied by the Moroccans.</p> <p>He castigated Spanish civil society - which is very active on the issue since Western Sahara is a former Spanish colony that Franco threw to the Moroccans to protect his own \"Gibraltars\" in Morocco, the Spanish enclaves of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melilla\">Melilla and Ceuta</a> - for encouraging the Sahrawis in their resistance.</p> <p>Van Walsum almost has a point when he says the UN security council \"is not ready to exercise its authority under <a href=\"http://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/chapter7.htm\">article VII of the UN charter</a>, and impose it.\" But why is he attacking the victims and their friends? One would have thought a Dutch diplomat, with the record of acquiescence to \"facts on the ground\" in Srebrenica, would be more circumspect. Why has he not pilloried Morocco and its friends in the Security Council - the US, France and Britain?</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.usip.org/pubs/specialreports/sr166_united_nations_sahara.html\">silence of the UN Secretariat</a> over the years has been stunning, since Morocco reneged on its 1991 agreement to allow a referendum in the territory. Indeed, there has often been complicity and connivance, as when then UN secretary-general <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_P%C3%A9rez_de_Cu%C3%A9llar\">Perez de Cuellar</a>, in his last week in office tried to get the security council to adopt a pro-Moroccan resolution over the Christmas and New Year's holidays.</p> <p>I was at the press briefing back in 1991 when Johannes Mantz, the Swiss diplomat charged with heading <a href=\"http://www.un.org/depts/dpko/missions/minurso/\">MINURSO</a> announced that it would only take a year to identify the voters and hold the referendum. I asked him at the time if he had consulted the King of Morocco, who had made it plain that the only referendum he would allow was one that he was guaranteed to win. Since then, Mohammed and his heir Hassan each refused to allow the referendum while the UN has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the sand dunes in preparation for it.</p> <p>There is a deafening sound of silence about Morocco's refusal to accept international law and security council resolutions, let alone honour its own promises. Initially backed strongly by France, Morocco now has American support, which nowadays always carries automatic British acquiescence as an added bonus.</p> <p>At least partly, Washington's support is because Morocco is Israel's closest partner in the Arab world, even though the King hedges his bets by being chair of the Arab League committee on Jerusalem. The latter position ensures that Arab states perennially concerned about Palestinian refugees and the separation wall are calmly insouciant about the Saharan refugees and the huge sand berm that Morocco has built across the territories it has occupied.</p> <p>However, there is a solution from the example of the British <a href=\"http://www.thecommonwealth.org/subhomepage/181764/\">Commonwealth</a>, which has been endlessly inventive in finding ways to maintain symbolic ties without real authority or responsibility. When the Moroccans referred the issue to the World Court, the ICJ, the judgement found no evidence \"of any legal tie of territorial sovereignty\" between Western Sahara and Morocco and said that the territory needed an act of self-determination. Neverthless, it did detect \"indication of a legal tie of allegiance between the [Moroccan] Sultan and some of the tribes of the territory.\"<br> So, enter King Hassan of Western Sahara, with all the powers and honours of Queen Elizabeth in her realms of Canada, Australia, Barbados and so on. The security council can then tell the King that he gets his due, while the Western Saharans clearly get what they want: effective independence. Polisario would surely be happy to offer a 21-gun salute and a few garden parties every time the King visited \u2013 maybe even build him a <a href=\"http://www.balmoralcastle.com/\">royal sand-castle</a> somewhere.</p> <p>But first, the western members of the security council have to put some truth to the rumours they keep spreading about their attachment to international law, democracy and the rights of small countries <a href=\"http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2008/08/the_annals_of_irony.php\">not to be bullied</a> and occupied by their neighbours.</p>",

  "<p>More than 400,000 holidaymakers face severe disruption at the end of the month after staff voted to go on strike at Britain's two busiest airports for charter airlines and low-budget carriers. </p> <p>Union leaders warned that industrial action at Gatwick and Stansted could spread across the UK with workers at Manchester, Birmingham and Newcastle airports also holding walk-out ballots. </p> <p>Baggage handlers and check-in staff at Gatwick and Stansted will stage 24-hour strikes on bank holiday Monday on August 25, and August 29, after rejecting a 3% pay rise offer. </p> <p>The strike by workers at airport services firm Swissport will affect services by Gatwick-based airlines including Virgin Atlantic, Thomsonfly, Monarch and First Choice and flights operated by Ryanair and easyJet at Stansted, where they are the biggest customers.</p> <p>The Unite union said all airlines using Swissport's services would be grounded. \"The flights could not operate. If these strikes go ahead it would effectively shut down the airlines' operations,\" said Steve Turner, Unite's national secretary for aviation.</p> <p>Swissport and airport owner BAA were holding talks with airline bosses last night to gauge whether they could keep flights running with a skeleton workforce. Swissport said it hoped to \"minimise disruption to the travelling public\" while one airline, Virgin Atlantic, said it had contingency plans in place and expected \"business as usual\" for its Gatwick flights. </p> <p>Ryanair said it would operate hand-luggage-only flights if the strikes went ahead. Services to Las Vegas, Lanzarote and Malaga would be among the flights affected on August 25 and 29. Industry experts warned that passengers should at least expect delays, if not cancellations, if last-ditch negotiations fail.</p> <p>\"The airlines and Swissport will attempt to draft in management and where possible use non-unionised workers. There will be a risk of delays and this is worst time of year for it to happen, at the peak of the summer season when flights are their fullest,\" said John Strickland, an airline consultant. Swissport said it intended to continue talks with the Unite and GMB unions over averting the strikes. </p> <p>BAA's much-maligned airports have had an uneventful summer but their vulnerability to operational mishaps was underlined on Thursday when thousands of passengers at Heathrow's Terminal 3 had to fly off without their bags after a computer glitch shut down the baggage handling system. </p> <p>BAA said 3,500 bags were separated from their owners following the software breakdown, which also saw 4,500 passengers ordered to queue up outside the terminal after check-in desks were closed. The airport group said airlines had begun reuniting passengers with their bags.</p> <p>Gatwick and Stansted are the UK's second and third largest airports and will handle a total of more than 200,000 passengers a day over the bank holiday weekend. Holidaymakers will be most affected because both airports are popular with charter and low-budget carriers. </p> <p>Unite described the 3% pay offer as an \"insult\" and has demanded a pay rise of 5% for its members, in the latest pay dispute to focus on the rising rate of inflation. </p> <p>\"Our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs. This pay offer is an insult to professional, hard-working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions. Our members have had enough,\" said Unite's Turner. </p> <p>A Ryanair spokesman said: \"This strike is totally unjustified. Union chiefs should be grateful that they are getting any increase at all at a challenging time for the global economy.\"</p> <p>Baggage screeners at Stansted have also voted to go on strike, but the airport said services would not be affected. BAA is braced for another blow to its business next week, when the Competition Commission is expected to demand the sale of Gatwick and one of its Scottish airports. </p> <p>The competition watchdog has already indicated that BAA's monopoly over airports in south-east England is bad for airlines and passengers because it encourages the group to hold back plans for new runways and underinvest in services.</p>",
  "<p>Anyone familiar with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidclark\">my writings</a> over the last few years will know that I share many of the premises behind the argument <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/14/russia.georgia\">set out</a> by Seumas Milne yesterday. America's conduct of the war on terror, enthusiastically abetted by the United Kingdom, has degraded the moral authority of the west. The Iraq war was a self-interested geopolitical misadventure dishonestly presented as a security or humanitarian imperative. The willingness of Washington and London to tolerate Israel's disproportionate military action against Lebanon in 2006 has left them wide open to the charge of hypocrisy in their response to the war in Georgia.</p> <p>This is where agreement ends, for I can't let Milne's argument go without pointing out a couple of important errors of fact and one major error of analysis.</p> <p>His first error of fact is the assertion that Georgia was part of the invasion of Iraq and therefore scarcely in a position to complain about the violation of its own sovereignty. This is plain wrong. Georgia did not deploy troops in Iraq <em>until after the war</em>, in August 2003, and did so under the mandate of <a href=\"http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N03/368/53/PDF/N0336853.pdf?OpenElement\">UN Security Council Resolution 1483 (pdf)</a>, passed in May 2003 by 14 votes to nil. Its troops were also part of a force operating with the agreement of the elected government of Iraq. I opposed the war as much as anyone, but there is no basis for arguing that Georgia's military presence in Iraq was a violation either of international law or Iraq's sovereignty.</p> <p>Milne's second error was to repeat as fact Russia's assertion that Georgian troops killed hundreds of civilians in their assault on Tskhinvali. There is no independent support for this claim, or for the bogus claims being made by both sides about genocide. The only authoritative independent assessment so far comes from Human Rights Watch and <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/08/13/russia19620.htm\">states the following</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>A doctor at Tskhinvali Regional Hospital who was on duty from the afternoon of August 7 told Human Rights Watch that between August 6 to 12 the hospital treated 273 wounded, both military and civilians. She said her hospital was the only clinic treating the wounded in Tskhinvali. The doctor said there were more military personnel than civilians among the wounded and added that all of the wounded were later transferred to the Russian Ministry of Emergencies mobile hospitals in South and North Ossetia. As of August 13, there were no wounded left in the Tskhinvali hospital. <br> The doctor also said that 44 bodies had been brought to the hospital since the fighting began, of both military and civilians. The figure reflects only those killed in the city of Tskhinvali. But the doctor was adamant that the majority of people killed in the city had been brought to the hospital before being buried, because the city morgue was not functioning due to the lack of electricity in the city.</p> </blockquote> <p>Everyone who cares about human rights \u2013 as opposed to those who use them as partisan debating points \u2013 has a responsibility to be objective and consistent in assessing claims of atrocities committed in war. It may transpire that crimes more serious than those so far unearthed by Human Rights Watch have been committed, but our conclusions should follow the evidence, not the dictates of political preference. There now needs to be a full investigation into what has happened in Georgia, and we should therefore welcome <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/europeCrisis/idUSLC608734\">the announcement</a> of the prosecutor of International Criminal Court that he is considering an inquiry. Anyone found guilty of violating international humanitarian law should be punished regardless of which side they belong to.</p> <p>My complaint about Milne's error of analysis concerns his attempt to make the Georgia conflict fit the anti-imperialist paradigm, which posits Georgia as a \"pro-western, anti-Russian forward base\" functioning at the behest of a rapacious and domineering America. The reality is that US policy towards Russia and the countries around it has been much more ambivalent and confused than Milne's picture allows. At their first meeting, President Bush claims to have looked Vladimir Putin in the eye and the seen the soul of a man he could trust. Sources claim Bush swallowed a lot of blather from Putin about his commitment to the Russian Orthodox Church, showing what a canny manipulator of people the ex-KGB colonel is. Between Bush's gullible religious mysticism and Dick Cheney's admittedly hawkish instincts, the administration's policy towards Russia has never really recovered a clear sense of direction.</p> <p>In each particular detail, Milne misreads or misrepresents the evidence of a grand American plan to undermine Russia. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/14/usa.poland\">Missile defence</a> is a strategic error for all sorts of reasons, but it is not directed at Russia. It stems, in the short term, from an obsession with the threat of small rogue states and the misguided belief that technology can provide the solution. In the unlikely event that missile defence works, other delivery systems will evolve to counter it. Underlying this is the unipolar imperative that the US should dominate the process of military-technological change across the spectrum. They are doing it because they can \u2013 or, at least, think they can \u2013 but there is no specifically anti-Russian objective involved.</p> <p>The role of the US in the so-called \"colour revolutions\" has been hugely exaggerated. In the case of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>, for example, there was outside \"interference\" from both east and west. In the case of assistance form America and Europe, this involved training political parties and NGOs in the latest techniques of open and democratic campaigning. In the case of Russia, assistance came in the form of an attempt to rig the ballot, to say nothing of the suspicion that they also tried to murder the opposition candidate. You be the judge of what is legitimate here. The fact is that Saakashvili and Yushchenko came to power because the people of Georgia and Ukraine wanted them.</p> <p>Finally, on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nato\">Nato</a> enlargement, the running on this has been made predominantly by countries that want to join, with the US and other Nato members following behind at variable rates of hesitancy. Until last week, many US policy makers were unsure that incorporating Georgia and Ukraine would be worth the bother. The fact that they are both still outside is a consequence of precisely the deference towards Russian concerns Milne says is lacking.</p> <p>Missing from all of this is any hint that the views of the people of Georgia or other post-Soviet countries, apart from Russia, count for anything. Integration into western institutions is not being foisted on anyone; it is being chosen willingly in almost every country that enjoys the freedom to decide for itself. I understand why many Russians resent that fact, but that cannot be an excuse for imposing their will by force. It must be the apex principle of a democratic Europe that every country has the right to decide its own external relations in accordance with its own interests. Without that, we are back to the Europe of Metternich and Bismarck, if not Ribbentrop and Molotov.</p> <p>Milne concludes by advancing the bizarre notion that Georgia's independence can only be guaranteed by accepting a status of neutrality; in other words, by subordinating its own will to that of Russia. Funny kind of independence. Funny kind of anti-imperialism.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/business/merrilllynch\">Merrill Lynch</a> could avoid paying tax in the UK for decades after booking \u00a313bn of losses on its toxic investments through its London subsidiary.</p> <p>The impact on the Treasury's coffers is the latest illustration of the impact the credit crunch is having on the wider economy and has led to concerns about the reduction in tax receipts on the government's fragile finances.</p> <p>Banks are a crucial contributor to the public's finances. National Audit Office data for the 2005/2006 financial year - the most recent available - shows that banks were the biggest payers of corporation tax at \u00a37bn. This is the payment from all large banks, and includes the high street banks as well as the London operations of Wall Street firms now hit hard by the credit crunch.</p> <p>The impact of the downturn in the profitability in the banking sector on tax receipts may become apparent in the pre-budget report this autumn when the Treasury makes its estimates for the public finances.</p> <p>Bill Dodwell, head of tax policy at accountants Deliotte, said: \"The good news is they have been collecting more corporation tax from the oil sector but who knows if that is going to compensate for the losses by the banks\".</p> <p>In the first half of the year, the profits of the high street banks listed in London are down \u00a314bn on the same period in 2007 which will have an impact on their tax bill which is set at the end of the financial year. For the first six months of last year the banks expected to pay taxes of more than \u00a35bn, but their latest set of figures indicate they now expect to pay \u00a31bn. </p> <p>Under UK law, losses can be carried forward indefinitely until the company has made as much in profit again as it has losses. According to accounts filed at Companies House earlier this month, Merrill Lynch made \u00a37.4bn of losses in the year to end-December compared with a profit of \u00a3393m the previous year. </p> <p>After the financial year end, the accounts show the firm recorded exceptional writedowns of \u00a35.5bn related to investments that have turned toxic in the credit crunch, taking the total loss to almost \u00a313bn. Merrill could yet record further losses on the collaterialised debt obligations - complex instruments at the core of its losses - which will also be booked through London.</p> <p>Merrill Lynch today took steps to attempt to return to profitability by announcing a hiring freeze. In a memo from New York head office signed by Gregory Fleming, president and chief operating officer, and Thomas Sanzone, chief administrative officer, the bank said that only financial advisors were immune from the ruling on headcount.</p> <p>The pair wrote: \"A global hiring freeze will be in place for the remainder of the year. This freeze covers any incremental hires including previously approved budgeted hires and replacement hires. This policy does not apply to financial advisors or client associates who the firm will continue to recruit and hire in line with business plans.</p> <p>\"Typically, the majority of the firm's hiring occurs during the first and second quarters of the year with the third and fourth quarters progressively tapering off,\" the memo said.</p>",
  "<p>As Katine's farmers prepare for cassava planting, Farm-Africa (which is working with Amref on the livelihoods component of the Katine Community Partnerships Project) has this week been training them in how to grow and manage new high-yielding varieties.</p> <p>Some 36 farmers turned up at the Katine sub-county headquarters to take a two-day course on how on-farm trials work and specifically about cassava planting and disease control. Farm has helped form 18 farmers' groups across the region, meaning the training was attended by two farmers from each group.</p> <p>From the beaming faces and the line of questioning, it was clear that the trainees found the sessions both interesting and useful.</p> <p>Among the more active participants was Tom Emwogu, whose name sounds curiously like \"emwogo\" \u2013 the Iteso (local language) word for cassava.</p> <p>\"I have seen yellowish and small leaves on some of my cassava crops, but I did not take it seriously,\" said Emwogu, from Obalanga Farmers' Group. \"But the trainer demonstrated that this is 'Mosaic disease'. I now know that once I identify such crops, I have to uproot them immediately and destroy them by burning them. Also, when planting, the stems from such crops should not be planted because the resulting plants would automatically be infected.\"</p> <p>Cassava is one of the staple foods in the Teso region, where Katine falls. According to the trainer for the day, Katine's agricultural officer James Odienyi, the price of this crop is a major indicator of the state of food security in the region. Because of that, cassava in this region is both used to feed households and is also a key source of income.</p> <p>At the beginning of the year, a basinful of dried cassava sold for 4,000 Ugandan shillings ($2.50) but it has now reached 10,000 shillings in the local market. Not surprisingly, farmers in the 18 groups supported by Farm-Africa chose cassava and groundnuts as the crops to grow on their demonstration farms.</p> <p>Participants learnt that the most serious emerging threat to cassava here is brown streak disease, which was discovered in the central region district of Mukonno. Emwogu wondered how a disease discovered 300 kilometres away found its way to Teso. Puzzled, he suggested that the disease was deliberately brought here to wipe out the region's cassava crop, but the trainer was quick to downplay this conspiracy theory.</p> <p>Some of the diseases and the relevant pests and control measures sounded rather strange to the farmers, none more so than \"Anagyrus Lopezi\" \u2013 the wasps used to control the cassava mealy-bug. On hearing the name, one woman exclaimed, \"what does that one look like if it has such a name?\" throwing the class into laughter.</p> <p>Trainer Odienyi, who came armed with cassava shoots showing symptoms of various diseases, said the classroom training was important because farmers were able to learn the planting methods and diseases and even take notes.</p> <p>\"These are the problems which reduce yields and in some cases wipe out a whole crop,\" he taught.</p> <p>The two members from each group will now return to their peers and share the knowledge they have acquired during the training sessions. According to Venansio Tumuhaise, the Katine project officer for livelihoods, this is easiest way to have all the groups covered in time for the planting season, which is now underway.</p> <p>At the start of the training, Tumuhaise had asked the participants to think of what they would do with the harvested crop. At the end he suggested that, besides selling the tubers and sharing out the stem cuttings, the farmers could in future make money by multiplying these high-yielding stem cuttings and selling them to other farmers from elsewhere.</p> <p>The trainees looked envious when they heard that Farm-Africa will have to buy planting materials for them from the neighbouring district of Amuria at a cost of nine million shillings ($5,500).</p>",

  "<p>Leftist ex-bishop Fernando Lugo became Paraguay's president today, ending six decades of one-party rule in a key step in the poor South American nation's democratic transformation.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of Paraguayans cheered as Lugo raised his hand in the air and was sworn in, wearing sandals and his trademark white mandarin-collared shirt to set himself apart from the suit-wearing politicians.</p> <p>Speaking in both Spanish and the Guarani indigenous language, Lugo pledged to end the misery and corruption that has defined Paraguay under the Colorado Party, which supported the brutal 1954-1989 dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner and has ruled ever since.</p> <p>\"Today Paraguay breaks with its reputation for corruption, breaks with the few feudal lords of the past,\" said Lugo, who neatly trimmed his beard for the ceremony.</p> <p>His first challenge will be to balance competing and potentially explosive interests. Elements of both the left and right have challenged his authority, raising the specter of political chaos and civil unrest.</p> <p>Landless peasants who have been seizing private property are threatening a much larger wave of invasions on land owned by rich farmers as early as this weekend. Members of his administration also suspect the outgoing government tried to undermine his presidency before it began by allowing critical supplies of fuel and medicine to disappear.</p> <p>The Colorados still control most institutions of government and will likely frustrate efforts at land reform in the small, landlocked country, where corruption is entrenched and an estimated 1% of the people control 77% of the land.</p> <p>Lugo's party, the Patriotic Alliance for Change, has allied with conservative lawmakers for form a tenuous majority in Congress, where most lawmakers remain beholden to the wealthy elite.</p> <p>Still, Lugo was optimistic in his inaugural address, saying transforming Paraguay \"won't be easy, but it's not impossible\".</p> <p>Even marginal change would be better than the legacy of Colorado rule for rural Paraguayans who often go hungry, said Marcelino Coronol, a 52-year-old Tobaqom Indian who traveled hundreds of miles with his family from the destitute Chaco desert region to attend the ceremony.</p> <p>\"I just want him to get rid of the corruption and the inequality so we have a chance at giving my children a future,\" Coronel said, as his wife nodded in agreement alongside their young son and daughter. \"In the Chaco, the government never did anything for us.\"</p> <p>Blanca Medina, 26, clutched a Paraguayan flag and almost broke into tears describing how she ekes out a living as a maid on a monthly salary of US $75. Lugo, she said, is the first Paraguayan politician who has ever cared about her needs.</p> <p>\"He's totally different from all the others,\" she said. \"He's humble and he listens to the people.\"</p> <p>While Lugo is under pressure to make changes fast, experts don't expect him to govern with sudden decrees like the continent's hardcore leftists, Bolivia's Evo Morales and Venezuela's Hugo Chavez. They predict he will seek broad support for reforms, in the style of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Brazil's center-left president.</p> <p>Those three leaders were among eight Latin American presidents who attended Friday's ceremony and welcomed him into the ranks of the region's growing left-leaning governments.</p> <p>Chavez promised to help Lugo bring \"a profound transformation\" to Paraguay.</p> <p>\"Our friend Fernando will have a revolutionary government, and he'll have difficult times ahead, but we'll support him,\" Chavez said. \"He won't be alone in his task of changing this country in a revolutionary way.\"</p> <p>Morales, also pledged support: \"Bolivia is putting itself at the side of this new administration to work together for the dignity of people neglected for decades due to the hegemony of the powerful groups,\" he said.</p> <p>Lugo, 57, spent 11 years as a bishop ministering to poor peasants in Paraguay's farmbelt before entering the political scene three years ago. The presidency is his first elected post.</p> <p>Despite receiving belated and unprecedented permission from Pope Benedict to resign as bishop, the new president promised Friday that \"this layman will remain faithful to his church.\"</p>",
  "<p>A group of detainees at an Oxfordshire immigration centre are on hunger strike and have pledged to continue refusing food \"until their very last breaths\" in protest against the forced deportation of asylum seekers. </p> <p>Thirteen Iraqi Kurds held at the Campsfield House site near Kidlington began refusing meals last Saturday after being told they would soon be sent back to Iraq and hearing reports that an Iraqi man had killed himself after being deported from the UK. </p> <p>A number of other detainees joined in the protest and it was thought more than 60 inmates, of many nationalities, were also refusing food during the past week.</p> <p>One of the hunger strikers, Fazzel Abdul, an Iraqi who has been in Britain for seven years, said they were now feeling very weak after seven days without food and only a little water. </p> <p>\"Without any reason we are being held here and they are trying to deport us to the most dangerous country in the world,\" he said. \"We want people to listen to us \u2013 we want a promise to be treated as human beings. We are refusing all food and water and we will keep going, we will carry on until our last breath. It is better to be dead than to return to Iraq.\"</p> <p>The Home Office said fewer than 30 people were now refusing their meals and described the situation as \"under control\". </p> <p>A spokesman said: \"A group of detainees at Campsfield have refused their meals over the past few days. The situation is under control and we are discussing with detainees their concerns.\"</p> <p>Inmates at Campsfield House, which holds some 200 asylum seekers and foreign prisoners, have staged a number of protests in the past over conditions at the centre and the policy of indefinite detention and forced returns. </p> <p>In March last year nine people were taken to hospital suffering smoke inhalation after violence broke out and fires were lit.</p>",
  "<h2>Uganda</h2> <p>A programme of mass circumcision to <strong><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/6h5l7u\">prevent the spread of HIV and Aids</a></strong> has been announced by the Ugandan government. It is responding to the results of recent studies that indicate that the procedure provides up to 70% protection from the deadly infection, if other safe sex practices such as condoms are also used. Taking advantage of what some tribal groups already call \"circumcision season\", the state hopes to encourage 3,000 young men aged 12-18 to go under the knife in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Aids activists have shown support and called for a similar approach to be adopted on a global scale, but critics argue that men may engage in more risky sexual behaviour if they think circumcision makes them immune. There are also concerns that HIV and other conditions could be further spread \u2013 in the past, scalpels have been re-used unsterilised, but the government has introduced a strict \"one knife per operation\" policy.</p> <p>* Also in the fight against Aids, Oxfam is calling on governments and international aid agencies to include <strong><a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org/en/policy/bp115-female-condom-0808\">the female condom</a></strong> in their disease prevention programmes: a recent report indicated that they are an effective yet much neglected form of protection.</p> <p>Women make up 75% of new HIV infection cases in sub-Saharan Africa but have often had little control over barrier contraception. Oxfam spokesperson Farah Kamiri said : \"The female condom is the only method that women have to protect themselves. It has been embraced in many countries and cultures, it works and it is cost-effective. Political leadership and funding are needed now. No more excuses.\"</p> <p>* Meanwhile, the New Vision reports that the first <strong><a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200808130095.html\">Ugandan-made anti-retroviral drugs</a></strong> are now on sale in the country. Pharmaceutical company Quality Chemical Industries is producing 60 million tablets per day in the first African factory to produce the drugs.</p> <p>Although they have not yet been granted a licence by the World Health Organisation, which have visited the factory, the drugs have been endorsed by the Ugandan National Drug Authority.</p> <p>* Elsewhere in Uganda, the Ministry of Education has received a large injection of cash from the African Development Bank to <strong><a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200808140148.html\">refurbish government-aided secondary schools</a></strong>, the New Vision reports.</p> <p>$70million has been donated to equip laboratories and libraries, to renovate classrooms and dormitories, to expand 15 secondary schools and to build 12 more. The schools, selected from all over the country, have not been refurbished for more than 30 years and have been struggling to cope with the number of students.</p> <h2>Kenya</h2> <p>Hopeful news is emerging from Kenya, where the Ministry for Energy claims to have found a way to <strong><a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200808130867.html\">increase production of bio-fuels without causing greater food shortages</a></strong>.</p> <p>The <strong><a href=\"http://www.irinnews.org\">United Nations humanitarian news department, IRIN</a></strong> reports on a five year strategy to cultivate the poisonous jatropha curcas shrub and process its seeds to produce bio-diesel for transport and power generation. If all goes according to plan, the Ministry foresees significant drops in the country's diesel imports and domestic use of kerosene over the next five years. Other benefits will include an increase in forest cover and a reduction in environmental degradation.</p> <p>The plan states that Kenyans will be able to, \"enjoy and derive comfort from the supply of bio-diesel for agricultural production, employment creation, rural-urban balance and blending in the motor vehicle industry.\"</p> <h2>Eastern European aid to Africa</h2> <p>Africa will benefit from increased support from Eastern Europe as a growing number of countries sign up to the European Union and its aid regulations. The end of the Cold War saw a redirection of resources away from Africa as aid money was focused on Eastern European countries instead, <strong><a href=\"http://www.afrol.com/features/25604\">Afrol News reports</a></strong>, but this trend is now slowly being reversed.</p> <p>The UN recommends that 0.7% of developed states' GDP be used for aid. Although the EU stipulations are lower (0.39% is the long-term goal), they require countries applying for membership to outline their international development aid policy and plans for setting up aid agencies.</p> <p>As former Communist countries have benefited from EU economic help, so their wealth has grown. Of the new EU members, Poland has most developed its donation policies and is about to meet the EU spending targets \u2013 Angola has been the main beneficiary.</p> <p>The spending on the continent will continue to increase in future as the EU aims to double aid by 2010, and triple it by 2015.</p>",
  "<p>Not since the first Olympic swimming event was staged in the Mediterranean in 1896 has British swimming felt quite so buoyant. Rebecca Adlington is already in line to become the most recognisable home-grown swimmer of either sex since Duncan Goodhew and her improvement is not an isolated blip. No longer do those trying to spot a GB cap automatically confine their search to the outside lanes. By the time the final two days of action at the Water Cube are completed two gold medals and one bronze, is hardly an inexhaustible supply of precious metal. But the travails of Sydney - Britain failed to win a single medal in the pool for the first time since the war - and modest return of two bronzes in Athens have been consigned to the past.</p> <p>Partly, of course, it is the Adlington effect. Mansfield's finest has demonstrated to everyone that the Brits need no longer feel inferior to their Australian and American counterparts. If a gloriously unaffected Corsa-driving teenager from Nottinghamshire can conquer the world, it would seem that times really are changing. \"It's been brilliant across the board,\" insists the team's flag-bearer Mark Foster, pointing out that, prior to Beijing, Britain had been represented in only four women's Olympic finals in 20 years. \"We've moved on as a nation without a shadow of a doubt and there's still a couple more chances to go. I think Becky's got a good chance of winning a second gold. If she does they'll make her a Dame.</p> <p>For some, not least performance director Michael Scott, the broader picture is perhaps the most instructive. There have been 20 individual finals in the Water Cube prior to the weekend. British women have been involved in six out of a possible 10 and the men in four, a healthy ratio given the surge in Chinese standards and the strength of the European challenge.</p> <p>Robbie Renwick, Liam Tancock, Gemma Spofforth, Elizabeth Simmonds, Jemma Lowe, Hannah Miley and Caitlin McClatchey, still all aged 23 or under like Adlington, Joanne Jackson (the bronze medal winner) and Davies, reached individual finals and should be available if required in four years' time. The women's 4x200m relay failure was an embarrassing setback but Spofforth came within four-hundredths of a second of securing a bronze in the 100m backstroke and Simmonds, just 17, could yet medal in the 200m backstroke.</p> <p>It is a far cry from the early days of the Bill Sweetenham era, the ultimate in no-pain no-gain reality checks. If Sweetenham rated British swimming in the slightest, he did a fine job of disguising his admiration. \"I'm like a mosquito in a nudist colony,\" muttered the Australian in 2003, \"I know what I want but I don't know where to start.\" Those reluctant to rise at 6am every day and submit to more intensive training regimes were pointedly directed towards the nearest highway.</p> <p>Nor did it take Sweetenham long to start working on the national psyche. Gentle achievement and second-class ambition was no longer acceptable. \"Just how hard do you want to win?\" he hissed to his charges in the build-up to the 2003 European Championships. \"Have you got a pet? Right, here's a gun. It's shoot the dog or win an Olympic medal, which one? Too late, the dog should've been dead by now.\"</p> <p>With the 10km open water events to follow next week, there could yet be even more reason to salute the gruff Aussie who resigned last September, claiming he had been given insufficient support following a complaint of bullying from which he was subsequently cleared. Foster, among others, stands by his belief that Sweetenham's blunt methods were not always appropriate but the case for the defence looks increasingly convincing. All that remains now is for someone to find Michael Phelps an English girlfriend and the future really will be rosy.</p>",
  "<p>Travellers face August bank holiday chaos at two of the UK's busiest airports because of a planned strike by workers including baggage handlers and check-in staff, it was warned today. </p> <p>Gatwick and Stansted are set to be hit by strikes on August 25 and again on August 29 in a dispute over pay, which could also spread to Manchester, Birmingham and Newcastle airports. </p> <p>Workers employed by Swissport have rejected a \"paltry\" 3% pay offer, which unions complained was well below the rate of inflation. </p> <p>The company was also accused of removing sick pay for the first three days of any absence due to illness, including industrial injury. </p> <p>Members of Unite at Gatwick and Stansted will take part in the strike, while GMB members at Stansted will also walk out on the same days. </p> <p>Unite will announce a ballot result among its Swissport members at Manchester airport next week and said workers in Birmingham and Newcastle airports would also be balloted for strike action over pay. </p> <p>National officer Steve Turner said: \"Our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs. </p> <p>\"This pay offer is an insult to professional, hard working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions. </p> <p>\"Our members have had enough. The liberalisation of ground handling services across UK airports has resulted in a race to the bottom which must and will stop. </p> <p>\"We will not stand back and allow labour costs to determine whether contracts are won or lost.\" </p> <p>A Swissport spokesman said: \"Swissport is aware of the disappointing news that a small number of union members have voted for strike action at Gatwick airport. </p> <p>\"Swissport believes that a fair offer has been made to the unions in the light of the current economic climate that reflects the cost of living increase. </p> <p>\"Swissport is working with the airport operator and the customer airlines to minimise disruption to the travelling public.\" </p> <p>The GMB said its members at Stansted would also strike on August 25 and 29 after voting by 9-1 in favour of industrial action. </p> <p>The union said the due date for a pay rise was April, but that the current offer was due to run from July. </p> <p>The workers involved in the dispute handle baggage and check-in arrangements for Ryanair and easyJet at Stansted. </p> <p>GMB officer Gary Pearce said: \"GMB members can not afford these low pay rises given the rising prices they have to pay for food, energy and transport. </p> <p>\"The employers, the airlines and the airport operator need to adjust their view as to what our members will now accept. The only way they have of meeting higher prices passed on to them is to raise their own prices in higher pay rises.\" </p> <p>More than 30 GMB members who screen luggage at Stansted will also strike on the Monday bank holiday in a separate dispute over pay after rejecting a 1.5% pay offer. </p> <p>The union complained that the workers were due a pay rise last January but their employers, Airfield Services, had been \"dragging their feet\". </p> <p>The workers screen baggage after it leaves check-in desks on the way to the hold of aircraft. </p> <p>Pearce said: \"These workers are doing one of the most vital jobs in the airport but are among the lowest paid.\" </p> <p>The union is asking for a 5% pay offer to keep pace with inflation.</p>",
  "<p>The ITV company handling the phone voting for the British Comedy Awards could be fined more than \u00a3100,000 by regulator Ofcom following the discovery of a new deception over the show's People's Choice award.</p> <p>Ofcom is understood to have discovered that in addition to viewers being misled in 2005 - when Ant and Dec were wrongly given the People's Choice award - there were problems with the same category at the British Comedy Awards in 2004.</p> <p>Viewers watching the ceremony in December 2004 were still encouraged to vote after the prize had actually been awarded to Little Britain stars Matt Lucas and David Walliams. </p> <p>Because the 2004 ceremony was not aired live - but shown \"as live\" with a delay - audiences were still voting on premium-rate lines after the phones should have been closed.</p> <p>In 2004, the People's Choice award - which is voted for by viewers during the show - was a battle between Little Britain, Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway and Jonathan Ross's BBC1 chatshow. </p> <p>It is not known how close the voting was between the three shows.</p> <p>However, it is understood that just under \u00a35,000 was wrongly taken from viewers and that the voting was not as close as it was in 2005, when Ant and Dec were said to have narrowly beaten comedian Catherine Tate.</p> <p>It emerged in May this year, after an investigation ordered by ITV, that in fact Tate should have won the mishandled premium rate phone vote for the People's Choice award in 2005.</p> <p>City law firm Olswang's review for ITV found that viewers were encouraged to carry on voting for the award at the December 2005 event even after it had already been presented to Ant and Dec.</p> <p>The main part of the awards show that year, which was produced for ITV by independent production company Michael Hurll Television, went out live on ITV1, but the broadcaster cut away from the event at 10.30pm to broadcast its news bulletin.</p> <p>However, the award ceremony carried on and was recorded to be broadcast \"as live\" once the news had finished.</p> <p>Following Olswang's report, Ant and Dec immediately returned the award. </p> <p>Olswang knew that the 2004 awards ceremony was broadcast \"as live\", as in 2005.</p> <p>The law firm alerted Ofcom to this, but did not publish it in the summary of its report for ITV in May because the thrust of the investigation was focused on finding out what happened in 2005. </p> <p>Ofcom has subsequently been looking into both the 2004 and 2005 British Comedy Awards.</p> <p>The media regulator is expected to fine ITV company Channel Television, although the penalty will not be on the scale of the record \u00a35.675m penalty it handed ITV plc earlier this year over a series of other phone-in scandals.</p> <p>Channel Television was the ITV company in charge of ensuring the British Comedy Awards complied with broadcasting rules and will be liable for any fine or other sanction handed down by Ofcom, rather than ITV plc.</p> <p>Ofcom is entitled to fine transgressors up to 5% of their \"qualifying revenue\".</p> <p>In Channel TV's case it is thought the qualifying revenue is about \u00a34m - meaning the regulator could fine it up to \u00a3200,000.</p> <p>A source familiar with the situation said that Ofcom sees repeated offences as more severe and with both the 2004 and 2005 British Comedy Awards irregularities, Channel TV could face a total fine of between \u00a3100,000 and \u00a3150,000. </p> <p>However, Ofcom is not due to make a final decision on the sanction until next month.</p> <p>It is likely that there will be an offer of reimbursements by ITV to any viewers who were misled over the People's Choice award or a donation to charity.</p> <p>Channel TV's executive chairman, Mick Desmond, said: \"Discussions between Ofcom and Channel continue and they are continuing to investigate.

  "<p>1) <strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xS43ILnd5Q\"> Swansea 5-1 Leeds </a>, Division One, 29/08/1991</strong></p> <p>The greatest opening-day performance in English football history came from a Welsh team. Swansea, in the top flight for the first time in their 69-year history, hosted a Leeds side who, though they would be relegated that season, had finished in the top half the previous year and had a decent reputation. And Swansea tore them a new one. <br>Highlights came thick and fast, as they tend to when you win 5-1. There was Bob Latchford's dummy for Swansea's opening goal; Latchford's nine-minute hat-trick on debut after his move from Everton; the swaggering, shoulder-dropping majesty of Alan Curtis's fifth goal; and a commentator who could barely have been more partisan had he started tearfully singing Delilah while gazing longingly at a picture of Nerys Hughes. Listen to the way his voice drops when Leeds equalise. Still, it was the only low note all day.</p> <p>2) <strong> Aston Villa 3-1 Manchester United, Premiership, 19/08/1995</strong></p> <p>Let's take real good care of a couple of myths surrounding this one. (If you don't remember the game, it's when Villa ransacked United's kids after Alex Ferguson had sold Paul Ince, Mark Hughes and Andrei Kanchelskis in the summer.)</p> <p>a) There were a number of reasons United were stuffed besides the obvious fact that they had seven players aged 21 or under in their 14-man squad: injuries and suspensions (Bruce, Cole, Giggs, Cantona and May); a very good Villa side, who would finish fourth; but most of all the fact that Ferguson had one of his last flirtations with a 5-3-2 system that has never worked for him.</p> <p>b) Alan Hansen's oft ridiculed \"you can't win anything with kids\" comment was basically right. With the team that played this game, United would have won nothing. As the season progressed, they invariably played only three of their youngsters (Nicky Butt, one of the Nevilles and David Beckham). And the fact that they won the Double was almost exclusively down to the almost superhuman peaks scaled by Peter Schmeichel and Eric Cantona in the final three months of the season.</p> <p>3) <strong>Sheffield Wednesday 2-3 Aston Villa, Division One, 17/08/1991</strong></p> <p>There was a mob calling for Ron Atkinson's inflated head on a stick long before his analysis of Marcel Desailly. In the summer of 1991, having managed Sheffield Wednesday to promotion and the League Cup, Atkinson said he would be \"barmy\" to leave \"the best job in the world\". A week later he did one to Aston Villa. Deliciously, the entirely random fixture computer made Villa's first game a trip back to Hillsborough. Atkinson, smiling like a perma-tanned Judas, seemed immune to the dogs' abuse he was getting, but it looked like Wednesday fans would go home happy when they roared into a 2-0 lead. David Hirst, superior to the similar Alan Shearer at this stage of their careers, swooshed an outrageous goal into the top corner from the angle of the box, and then superbly created the second for Danny Wilson.</p> <p>But, as the proverb doesn't go, fortune favours the unreconstructed bigot, and Atkinson's Villa got back into the game on the stroke of half-time when Chris Woods flapped the ball on to the head of Cyrille Regis. After half-time, Villa had a collective 'Eureka!' moment and realised that Wednesday's shockingly naive halfway-line offside trap was so ill-conceived that it could have been the work of Baldrick (even worse, it was actually the work of Trevor Francis). Villa took advantage through, first, Dalian Atkinson and then, right at the death, Steve Staunton. It was the ultimate hoof in the weapons cabinet for Wednesday fans, but at least they had the last laugh: they finished third, four places and 15 points above Villa.</p> <p>4) <strong>Arsenal 2-4 Norwich, Premier League, 15/08/1992</strong></p> <p>If memory serves, Arsenal were the bookies' favourites for the inaugural Premier League title after a storming finish to the previous season. In 1991-92 they were the top scorers in the league; in 1992-93, absurdly, they would be the lowest scorers. But all was well for the first hour, after Steve Bould and Kevin Campbell put them 2-0 up against Norwich, being managed for the first time by Mike Walker.<br> Then Walker brought on his new signing, Mark Robins, and slowly Norwich began to silence the famous North Bank mural, which had been brought in to improve the Highbury atmosphere. Goals from Robins, David Phillips and Ruel Fox gave Norwich the lead, and then Robins sealed the victory with a superb chip after a mistake from Tony Adams, who dithered, transfixed by the ball, as if it had just morphed into a bottle of Scotch and he was debating whether it was bad form to open it and start swigging in front of 24,030 people. Norwich would have many a celebratory drink that season on the way to their highest-ever position of third.</p> <p>5) <strong>Sampdoria 3-3 Lazio, Serie A, 06/09/1992</strong></p> <p>Even though Serie A's stock has probably never been higher in this country than it was in the late 80s and early 90s, Channel 4 took a bit of a risk when they bought the rights in 1992. After all, the product was renowned for engaging the cells more than the hairs on the back of the neck. But Channel 4 got massively lucky with two things: the unexpected success of a balding man sat reading the paper (it evokes Mel Brooks's description of Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm: 'There is something about this middle-aged bald man that is <em>thrilling</em>'), and the backpass law.</p> <p>The latter, introduced in 1992, threw defenders into the most hilarious disarray for the first few weeks. It was cold turkey, basically. You could imagine defenders, like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDLSirYQAik\">Mark Renton in Trainspotting</a>, shouting \"I appreciate what you're tryin' to do, I really do \u2026 but I just need one more backpass like. I NEED ONE MORE BACKPASS!\" In the first five weeks of the previous season, there had been 88 goals from 45 games (1.96 per game); in the first five weeks of 1992-93 there were 159 in 45 games (3.53 per game). Six came in the first live game shown on C4, a <a href=\"http://www.interlog.it/enciclopedia/incontri.php?action=page&amp;id=382\">3-3 humdinger</a> between Sven-Goran Eriksson's (and Des Walker's) Sampdoria and Lazio, for whom Beppe Signori scored twice on debut (you can see both goals right at the start of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_VX0fcZfGI\">this</a> video). In the space of 90 minutes, an arresting diversion had become must-see TV.</p> <p>6) <strong>Manchester United 4-1 Arsenal, Division One, 19/08/1989</strong></p> <p>Hope and its antisocial sibling, delusion, are the most prevalent emotions on the opening weekend of the season, and rarely have they embraced as powerfully as on this blissful summer's day in M16. It started with Michael Knighton, who had just agreed to buy Manchester United for \u2013 and you'll like this \u2013 \u00a310m, showing he was 'a proper fan' by juggling the ball in front of the Stretford End. Then United trounced the champions Arsenal 4-1. In the process, Neil Webb embroidered a splendid debut with a stunning, swirling volley that came within smooching distance of technical perfection. A long-overdue title challenge finally seemed to be on the cards. It was all so intoxicating that even Mike Phelan looked like a star. It wasn't a new season; it was a new era.</p> <p>Or not. Knighton was soon exposed as a chancer with no money. Webb's career was ruined when he ruptured his Achilles on England duty 18 days later. And United were embroiled in a relegation battle until the start of April. It was all a faux show.</p>",
  "<p>Permit me to expand briefly on why I think gratuitously angering Russia is kind of a bad idea.</p> <p>We all know China is about to dominate the world, right? If you asked your average person in the street in either America or Britain to name the world's top three powers, you'd probably get: the United States; China; and third, I think most people would say Russia, but you'd likely hear a few Indias and maybe some other choices.</p> <p>Now consider power in terms of nuclear arsenals. Assuming you haven't checked lately, you may think that by now, China may have about as many nukes as the other great powers.</p> <p>Ahem. Check <a href=\"http://www.cdi.org/nuclear/database/nukestab.html\">this </a>out. China has about 400 suspected nuclear warheads. Russia has at least 12,000 (as does the US). </p> <p>Granted, 400 is plenty enough, but the point is that we don't want another situation where the world's two greatest nuclear powers are at each other's throats. That wasn't good for either society, let alone for the Cubans and Congolese and Angolans and Guatemalans and lots of other folks.</p> <p>What we want, instead, is reduction and even, eventually, elimination of all nuclear arsenals. Radical and crazy? It's <a href=\"http://www.yesmagazine.org/article.asp?id=2692\">the official position</a> of well-known Chomsky acolytes Henry Kissinger and George Schultz and Sam Nunn. </p> <p>If the Bush administration leaves office having ratcheted up US-Russia tension, among its other signal triumphs...well, it'll be par for the course, but yet another disaster.</p>",
  "<p>Having watched just about every one of the 29,500 arrows shot in seven days of archery competition, may I share with you something that has no point. At the Paris Olympics of 1900, there was a poodle-clipping competition. Seriously. A French farmer's wife won gold.</p> <p>If there is a point it is that obviously the French wanted that particular discipline because they thought they might win a medal. And so it is to this day that certain countries have sports dear to their medal chances. We love a bit of rowing and cycling, it would appear.</p> <p>But nobody overloads themselves with more expectation than the Koreans (South, but the North quite fancy their prospects, too) do in archery. Their women, until yesterday, had won every gold medal going since 1984 - that's six golds at six Games. To that tally could be added seven more of the other colours, to make it 13 out of all the 18 medals available in individual competition, to say nothing of the team medals, which have been gold all the way.</p> <p>Today, their tally still looks good: 15 from 21, plus another gold in the team event. But they did not win individual gold, Park Sung-hyun losing her Olympic title to Zhang Juan Juan of China.</p> <p>In the men's event, the team was successful too, taking gold, but their fortunes in the individual event continue to be, well, ordinary. To the two silvers and one bronze from the last six Games, the Koreans can now add another silver.</p> <p>That in Korean is 'just a silver.' The world champion of 1993 Park Kyung-mo, on his 33rd birthday here in Beijing, lost in the final to Viktor Ruban of the Ukraine. He was doing fine until, when all before had been 9s and 10s, he dropped his penultimate arrow into the 8 ring.</p> <p>It was close - 113-112 - but, let's face it, it didn't satisfy the Koreans' craving for bow and arrow glory. A haul of two golds, two silvers and a bronze is a rancid dog of a collection.</p> <p>The Koreans take their archery seriously enough to send their best on sentry duty in the demilitarised zone between them and their neighbours to the north, supposedly to improve powers of concentration. They fill stadiums and hurl abuse at the archers as they are about to shoot, to improve focus.</p> <p>But it appears the Chinese have moved ahead in the game of not flinching under duress. Stories are leaking out of live snakes inserted into the shirts of archers as they take their positions on the shooting line.</p> <p>It all explains why the British did not have a good archery week. Until the members of Royal Leamington Spa Archery Club are prepared to step forward with ferrets up their trousers, we shall remain off target.</p> <p>Or maybe we should just make trouser-ferreting an Olympic sport. Or bring back the poodles.</p>",

  "<p><br>Not hard to swallow ... Sam Rockwell (right) and Brad William Henke in Choke</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.firstshowing.net/2008/08/02/raunchy-red-band-trailer-for-chuck-palahniuks-choke/\">This tantalising, somewhat x-rated promo</a> has been around for a little while now, but what with the fact that it keeps getting pulled from YouTube, while the version on the official website seems to be impossible to access, we haven't felt the time was quite right to draw your attention to it.</p> <p>I was lucky enough to catch a preview of Choke earlier this week, which was followed by a Q&amp;A with author Chuck Palahniuk. The man who created Tyler Durden told the audience that he felt first-time writer-director Clark Gregg's movie was a superior work to his original tome, which <a href=\"http://www.totalfilm.com/movie_news/exclusive_i_always_saw_choke_as_a_sequel_to_fight_club...\">he himself describes as a loose sequel to Fight Club</a>.</p> <p>Choke returns to the world of support groups, but this time the central protagonist is sex addict Vincent Mancini (a career-defining turn from Sam Rockwell) who doesn't seem to be trying very hard to rid himself of his terrible affliction. Mancini, who works as a colonial theme park tour guide, has a former wild-child mother (Angelica Huston) in a mental institution who always thinks he's someone else when he visits.</p> <p>He also discovers part-way through the film that he may actually be the literal son of God. Oh, and he maintains a bizarre scam which involves sticking too much food down his throat at restaurants so that fellow guests are forced to administer <a href=\"http://www.patient.co.uk/showdoc/40001960/\">the Heimlich manoeuvre</a> (hence the title). He then taps his rescuers for cash to pay his mum's expensive bills.</p> <p>I think Choke is going to appeal hugely to fans of Fight Club and Palahniuk's books when it hits screens here on November 21. It is to Fight Club what Roger Avary's excellent Rules of Attraction was to American Psycho: lighter in tone but with similar sensibilities and a refreshing switch in style.

  "<p>Rents will fall by up to 10% this year, according to some of Britain's biggest letting agents, as a wave of properties that owners and developers can't sell have started to flood the rental market.</p> <p>The fall in rents will bring welcome relief to tenants but will squeeze buy-to-let landlords who now face a triple whammy of falling property values, sliding rental income and rising mortgage costs. To add to their misery, the Law Commission this week issued proposals on \"encouraging responsible letting\" that are likely to drive up administrative costs for landlords.</p> <p>The forecast fall in rents will bewilder landlords, given that many who would otherwise be buying are sitting out the property market woes by renting instead. Shouldn't that be pushing up rents?</p> <p>The reality, according to property agents Knight Frank, is that although there is a big rise in the number of people wanting to rent, it has been more than offset by a surge in \"forced landlords\" who, unable to sell, are now placing properties with letting agents.</p> <p>Liam Bailey, head of residential research, says rents in the London area peaked in 2007 and will fall 10% this year. \"The problem is that the volume of tenants has risen by 25%, but the volume of property available for rent has risen by 35%. There is a lot of stock coming in from people who can't sell and who are putting it on the rental market instead. There is a lot of choice out there for tenants.\"</p> <p>Jane Ingram, head of lettings at Savills, says: \"Across the UK we are seeing a lot of people choosing to rent rather than buy, and our offices are very busy. But there has also been a surge in stock, and I would say in some areas [rental] prices have fallen by 10%. In Docklands, in particular, we are seeing an oversupply. Developers have decided not to sell and are putting properties through the lettings market.\"</p> <p>Knight Frank and Savills have a strong bias towards higher-priced lets in London and the south-east, but in the rest of the UK there is growing evidence of a wider slide in rents. According to the Gumtree 2008 rental index issued this week, average rents over the past year have fallen by 0.9% in Leeds, 2.7% in Manchester and 3.5% in Birmingham. However, not all surveys suggest rents are under pressure. Buy-to-let lender Paragon says that, in the past year, rents have risen by 9.3%.</p> <p>Many amateur buy-to-let landlords who poured into the market in 2006 and 2007 may be facing huge losses. Hargreaves Lansdown suggested this week nearly 200,000 buy-to-let mortgages taken out in 2007 may be in negative equity as a result of falling house prices, and that 10,000 are in arrears.</p> <p>\"Recent buy-to-let investors may find themselves facing a 90% capital loss if they borrowed 90% of their property value,\" says Laith Khalaf of Hargreaves Lansdown. \"Property investors may be forced to sell up prematurely because interest payments become unaffordable. The real test of affordability is to come in 2009/10 when those who borrowed large sums at relatively cheap rates in 2007 come off two and three-year fixed deals.\"</p> <p>Zoe Mernick, 24, this week rented a flat in Clapham, south London, which the owner had spent months trying to sell. When hunting for a flat, she found many \"forced landlords\" had unrealistic expectations about rents. \"We've seen flats with no kitchens and not even enough space for a packet of breakfast cereal - they assume you only need a microwave and a freezer. Lots had no storage space for clothes, and there was one where the second bedroom was separated from the rest of the flat by a curtain. Some have been overpriced by as much as \u00a3500 a month, because that's what they need to pay the mortgage.\"</p> <p>Her flatmate, Sarah Brewer, says: \"Estate agents tell us they have to follow landlords' instructions even if they are ridiculous. Landlords just aren't adjusting to the market.\"</p>",
  "<p>One of the reasons why Labour politicians find it hard to attack David Cameron is because they can't agree what he represents.</p> <p>Is he closet Thatcherite? A paternalistic toff? A \"shallow salesman\", who does not really believe in anything? Or, as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jul/29/davidmiliband.labour\">David Miliband said in his Guardian article last month,</a> \"a politician of the status quo - a status quo he consistently voted against\".</p> <p>None of these answers has been entirely convincing. But this week the Institute for Public Policy Research published an article in its journal Public Policy Research that attempts to solve the puzzle of what Cameron actually stands for.</p> <p>It's by Richard Reeves, who has just been appointed as director of Demos. It's not available online, but here are his key conclusions.</p> <p>The first point - and this is bad news for Labour - is that Cameron is not a fake.</p> <p>\"Cameronism is real - as real as New Labour, or the Third Way - and is likely to be the guiding light of the next government,\" writes Reeves.</p> <p>(This may seem obvious - unless you want to get sidetracked into an argument about whether New Labour or the Third Way were real - but I think there are plenty of Labour ministers who still do not really believe it.)</p> <p>As for what Cameronism actually is, Reeves thinks we are now in a position to know the answer.</p> <p>\"Cameronism is certainly not an ideology, nor even - yet - a coherent political philosophy. Cameron himself, in his Keith Joseph lecture, explicitly rejected 'ideological' politics, in favour of 'practical conservatism'. But the broad contours of his thinking, and that of the bright politicians and advisers around him, are now visible. Cameron is asking hard questions about Labour's record, and the state of the nation. But he is asking tough questions of himself too, which have to be answered before his party can be considered fit for government.</p> <p>\"Cameronism displays a number of key features: it emphasises the pragmatic over the theoretical; takes an essentially optimistic view of human nature; favours the devolution, rather than the centralisation, of power; stresses social, rather than economic, progress; and places more faith in society than the state.\"</p> <p>Reeves also quotes a line from a speech Cameron delivered this year that he describes as \"the best summary of Cameronism Cameron himself has yet articulated\". It's the line where Cameron said: \"We want to respond to what should be a new post-bureaucratic age, by decentralising power, by giving people more opportunity and control over their lives, by making families stronger and society more responsible.\"</p> <p>Reeves says, although people have in the past tended to exaggerate the differences between the main political parties, \"the level of political disorientation caused by Cameronism is still difficult to cope with\". He believes Cameronism represents \"genuine radicalism\".</p> <p>The article is mostly positive. It is based on what Cameron and his allies have said and written (rather than on how they voted a few years ago) and it doesn't address the awkward issue of how much support there is for Cameronism within the Conservative party as a whole (which could turn out to be where the Tories are vulnerable).</p> <p>But Reeves is not uncritical. He says Cameron wants to create a \"responsible society\" by encouraging better behaviour, but he questions whether this is really feasible.</p> <p>\"There is more than a hint here, in Jon Elster's phrase, of Cameron 'willing that which cannot be willed'. Cameron wants to 'roll forward society', but it is not yet clear how this can be achieved, and doubtful it can be achieved unless the Conservatives move to a more balanced view of the state.</p> <p>\"Cameron verges on hypocrisy on the issue of state action. He has set up a Young Adult Trust, which he says is 'working in partnership with many of Britain's leading youth organisations to develop plans for all 16-year-olds that help teach them the responsibilities of adulthood'. </p> <p>\"A national programme to teach adulthood? If Ed Balls announced it, the Tories would be turning it into a piece of 'nanny state gone mad' propaganda. Cameron is quite right that Labour is very often guilty of knee-jerk statism, but he is equally at risk of unthinking anti-statism.\"</p> <p>I'm not sure this is much use to the poor soul who has the job of coming up with a strategy for Labour to win the next election. But at least it probably helps to understand what you're up against.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This blog was amended on Friday August 15 2008.

  "<p>Bradley Wiggins began his defence of his Olympic 4,000m title on the Laoshan velodrome in the most emphatic style possible, breaking his own Olympic record with a time of 4min 15.031sec on the Laoshan velodrome. He will be virtually impossible to dislodge in tomorrow's rounds, with the only man on the track to approach his time the New Zealander Hayden Roulston.</p> <p>The reigning world champion across his three disciplines, the 28-year-old Londoner is bidding to take three Olympic gold medals in the five days of track competition, beginning with the individual pursuit, continuing with the team event on Sunday and Monday before contesting the Madison with Mark Cavendish on Tuesday.</p> <p>In his qualifier, Wiggins was up against the world championship bronze medallist Alexei Markov of Russia, the pair starting on opposite sides of the track and \"pursuing\" each other for the distance. Wiggins started steadily but was the fastest man on the track after two kilometres, by which time it was clear that he was within Olympic record pace.</p> <p>Riding with the implacable rhythm of a metronome, Wiggins never faltered and as the third kilometre approached he had Markov in his sights. By the finish they were in the same straight and the Briton was in total control.</p> <p>Wiggins will face the slowest qualifier, Alexandr Serov of Russia in tomorrow morning's second round, which will in turn decide the line-ups for the finals, with the fastest four going through to ride-offs for gold and silver, bronze and fourth. </p> <p>Wiggins's 20-year-old team-mate Steven Burke made his Olympic debut in fine style, catching his opponent Carlos Alzate of Colombia with two laps remaining to finish in 4min 22.260sec, knocking nine seconds off his personal best for the distance. He qualified in fifth place and will race against Volodymyr Dyudya of the Ukraine tomorrow morning.</p> <p>In the biggest upset of the evening, the silver medallist at the Manchester world championships, Jenning Huizinga of the Netherlands was overhauled in the third kilometre by Roulston, finishing in a surprisingly slow 4min 37.097sec in spite of using a curious aerodynamic position, with his hands up in front of his face.</p>",
  "<p>\"Oh would some power the giftie gie us, to see ourselves as others see us,\" wrote Robert Burns in <a href=\"http://quotations.about.com/cs/poemlyrics/a/To_A_Louse.htm\">To a Louse</a>. But democratically elected governments face incessant scrutiny. So it is unusual to see one exposing itself voluntarily to the glare of critical inspection. But that is what the British government did when it submitted its report to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/15/labour.idcards\">United Nations' committee on human rights</a> under section 40 of the international covenant on civil and political rights. The committee's conclusions offer insights that should intrigue all who care about freedom of speech.</p> <p>The UN is concerned that the application of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/medialaw\">law of libel</a> in English courts has \"served to discourage critical media reporting on matters of serious public interest\". It is referring to the chilling effect of the phenomenon known as libel tourism, which has allowed powerful interests to obstruct the publication abroad of books and articles by suing for libel in English courts.</p> <p>In 2004 the Saudi investment banker <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/mar/31/pressandpublishing.saudiarabia\">Khalid bin Mahfouz</a> won a default defamation judgment in the high court against the American academic Rachel Ehrenfeld over allegations contained in her 2003 book Funding Evil: How Terrorism is Financed. At the time of the trial the book had sold only 23 copies in the UK. Ehrenfeld described the process of libel tourism exploited in that case as \"a form of intellectual terrorism\". Her American lawyers called it part of the most important challenge to free speech in the past 50 years.</p> <p>That same year another author, Craig Unger, had publication of his book <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jul/31/highereducation.news\">House of Bush: House of Saud</a>: The secret relationship between the world's two most powerful dynasties, scrapped in the UK. His publishers were concerned that the Saudi Royal family would use British libel law to sue for damages.</p> <p>British lawyers and politicians have paid little attention to the points of principle at stake. They should wake up, not least because the internet now means that material published in one country can be deemed to be nigh universally available. In these circumstances libel tourism has the potential to turn English courts into censorship enforcement agencies for litigants with secrets to hide and money to burn. It poses a wholly unacceptable threat to academic freedom and freedom of speech. </p> <p>The UN committee is also critical of the Official Secrets Act 1989 on the grounds that it can be used to prevent whistleblowing by former public servants. The case of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/davidshayler\">David Shayler</a>, the former MI5 agent, is one such example. Shayler was sentenced to six months' imprisonment under sections 1 and 4 of the act after writing about the activities of the security services in the Mail on Sunday. </p> <p>The 1989 act was designed to improve the 1911 version which banned publication of details as arcane as the brand of crockery used in the Home Office unless its release was authorised. It is helpful to be reminded that the revised legislation remains potentially oppressive. There is no public interest defence for civil servants who leak information about what the government is doing in our name. The House of Lords confirmed this in the Shayler case. </p> <p>So, does Britain stand condemned as a haven for censorship, secrecy and oppression? The picture is not so stark. The failings highlighted by members of the UN committee were carefully identified for them by diligent British civil servants. Bravo ladies and gentlemen. And now that you have offered ministers the blessing Robert Burns prized, we journalists must do our duty to the public sphere by maintaining pressure on them to liberalise the law.</p>",
  "<p>Should George Bush feel vindicated in his decision to invade Iraq five years ago, now that the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/15/iraq.military\">situation in Iraq - particularly Basra - is improving</a>?</p> <p>No doubt as he leaves the White House, Bush will argue that a more stable Iraq justifies his decision to topple Saddam Hussein. The US president is bound to repeat the mantra that the world is better off without Saddam. <a href=\"http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article4390033.ece\">The dramatisation House of Saddam</a> is a useful reminder of what a nasty piece of work he was, not to mention his pathological elder son, Uday.</p> <p>The debate is more than academic, as Iraq represents a clear division between the two US presidential hopefuls. Barack Obama opposed the war from the start, as well as the surge, while his Republican rival, John McCain, backed the surge and is more inclined to give Bush the benefit of the doubt on invading in the first place.</p> <p>But one leading US commentator is adamant the costs of invading Iraq have outweighed any benefits. <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121876047023242841.html?mod=googlenews_wsj\">Francis Fukuyama of End of History fame wrote in the Wall Street Journal yesterday</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"By invading Iraq in the manner it did, the US exacerbated all of the threats it faced prior to 2003. Recruitment into terrorist cells shot up all over the world. North Korea and Iran accelerated their development of nuclear weapons. Iran has emerged as the dominant regional power in the Persian Gulf once the US removed its major rival from the scene and put its Shi'ite clients into power in Baghdad. While everyone is better off without Saddam Hussein around, the cost was hugely disproportionate. If you don't believe this, ask yourself whether Congress would ever have voted to authorise the war in 2002 if it knew there was no WMD, or that there would be trillion-dollar budget outlays, or that there would be 30,000 dead and wounded after five years of bitter struggle.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Fukuyama then goes on to make the point that after having invaded Iraq, the US does not have much of a leg to stand on in \"trying to rally opposition to Russia on the basis of international law and norms constraining the strong from using force against the weak\".</p> <p>Interestingly, this neo-conservative goes on to throw his vote behind Obama rather than McCain because the Democrat does not share \"McCain's instinctive reliance on hard power as the primary instrument for dealing with messy questions of terrorism and proliferation in the broader Middle East\".</p> <p>This is an edited extract from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/wrap/subscribe\">The Wrap</a>, guardian.co.uk's digest of the day's papers</p>",

  "<p>The 46th Bundesliga season kicks off tonight with Bayern v Hamburg and the competition is guaranteed to be bigger and, ahem, bigger than ever: 172 countries will carry the live-feed from the Allianz Arena, up from \u2013 oh yes \u2013 171 last year round. (You wonder which new country the Bundesliga suits managed to cajole into signing up. Tuvalu? St. Kitts and Nevis? Andorra? It's probably Kosovo. They didn't officially exist yet last year)</p> <p>Attendance figures are set to rise again thanks to the return of FC K\u00f6ln and Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, two proper sides with big stadiums. Most clubs are even run profitably. All would be rosy and lovely in the Bundesliga garden if it weren't for Bernhard Heitzer, the new b\u00eate noire of German football. Heitzer, an avid fan himself, is the president of the German competition commission, a public body that has caused the clubs endless grief this summer. The commission has looked into the league's proposed \u20ac2.5bn (\u00a31.98bn) TV deal for 2009-10 to 2014-15 and found it unacceptable. They argued that centralised marketing by the clubs, a de-facto cartel, could only be justified if the consumer benefited materially. They went on to define that benefit quite narrowly: a free-to-air highlight show before 8pm has to remain an intrinsic part of the Bundesliga TV schedule (We get all the games and goals from 6.30pm at the moment). In a snide aside, Heitzer noted English pay-tv consumers paid roughly four times as much as Germans, for less than half of all the games. \"But the results of their national team in the big competitions don't seem to have been helped by the blessings of high pay-tv income at all,\" he sniggered gratuitously.</p> <p>The league are in shock because the commission's opinion amounts to a law proscribing early evening MOTD-type coverage by public broadcasters at the expense of Premiere, the sole pay-tv channel. Even without Alan Shearer in the studio, it's a bit of a nightmare scenario, because the value of the rights will naturally decrease. \"The [commission] abuses the league and endangers professional football in Germany with their intervention\", said angry league-CEO Christian Seifert, \"it's a populist decision, paradoxically designed to decrease competition rather than to increase it.\" Insiders feel Heitzer has been secretly spurred on to adopt this stance by the German government. The situation is further complicated by the bigger teams' conflict of interest. They'd be the first ones to benefit from de-centralised marketing: Bayern's rights are said to be worth \u20ac100m (\u00a379.4m) alone, more than three times as much as they're currently getting. Officially, they support the egalitarian status quo but they could well be the real winners of this contest.</p> <p>Rest assured that there will be a 47th season next year. Some sort of compromise will be reached eventually, in the classic Bundesrepublik Deutschland style.</p> <p>The best thing about this tedious tale was the fact that it made up for a distinct lack of tedious transfer tales this summer. Champions Bayern only brought in veteran keeper Hans-J\u00f6rg Butt as Michael Rensing's understudy \u2013 they don't really trust the 24-year-old between the sticks and might well go for a bigger name in the winter \u2013 and Werder Bremen's reassuringly haughty midfielder Tim Borowski, both on a free. \"Our squad is good enough\", said new manager J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann, \"if we had two more players, it would be difficult to keep everyone happy\". Maybe that's why Bayern made both Mathieu Flamini and Gennaro Gattuso offers they could refuse and saw their \u20ac25m (19.8m) bid for Stuttgart's Mario G\u00f3mez turned down.</p> <p>Of course Klinsmann himself has really been the biggest signing for the Bavarians, as he's brought a bus-load of coaches, assistants, scouts and fitness experts with him to the S\u00e4benerstrasse. He's also placed some Buddha figurines and white sun beds on the roof terrace of the new training ground complex to create a \"wellness oasis\", as Karl-Heinz Rummenigge described it, in an unintentionally mid-90s boutique hotel retro-style.</p> <p>Hamburg, their opponents tonight, are still smarting from Rafael van der Vaart's predictable \u20ac16m <a href=\"http://bundesliga.theoffside.com/files/2007/08/vandervaart.jpg\">defection to Real Madrid</a>, a \"dream move\" for the 25-year-old. \"He was the best Hamburg player for 25 years,\" said manager Martin Jol. The northerners will have to get one or two very decent replacements in before the end of the month, otherwise contesting the Uefa Cup places will be the extent of their ambitions.</p> <p>Their rivals Schalke also have a new Dutch coach, Fred Rutten. The ex-Twente Enschede doesn't quite have as strong a Dutch accent as his successor Steve McClaren, but he's got Orlando Engelaar instead: the lanky Holland midfielder who followed him to Gelsenkirchen. Schalke will, in all likelihood, make it 50 years without a championship this season. They should be useful side, however, new striker Jefferson Farf\u00e1n's shoulder injury notwithstanding.</p> <p>Bremen, meanwhile, are trying hard to rescue Claudio Pizarro from his sad life in London's night-clubs, they'll need at least one more good striker to be serious contenders. Both Stuttgart and Felix Magath's Wolfsburg will also push for a Champions League place but the perhaps biggest story of the year will be the incongruous rise of TSG 1899 Hoffenheim. 3,300 people live in that tiny city, but 13,300 have bought season-tickets \u2013 the whole region wants to be part of the Bundesliga's first ever start-up venture. Billionaire Dietmar Hopp started providing financial backing to his former team, a non-descript amateur outfit playing in the A-Klasse (the seventh league) in 1990. Six promotions later, Ralf Rangnick's side have already started to frighten the established order with some smart Brazilian buys and a youth academy system modelled on Arsenal. Hopp's not quite Roman Abramovich, but he's the first big spending president this league's ever had. There'll plenty of hard feelings and jealousy; and some decent football in the bargain. It should all be terribly emotional as well. </p> <p>Watch out Kosovo \u2013 here we come.</p>",
  "<p>It's complicated, so concentrate. Carolijn Brouwer, the world sailor of the year 10 years ago, was born in Leiden in the Netherlands, for whom she sailed at both the 2000 and 2004 Olympics in Sydney and Athens. But this time she is representing Belgium because her former boyfriend, Belgian Sebastien Godefroid, is in the same boat - literally.</p> <p>Brouwer chose to switch nationalities although the Dutch were keen to have Godefroid on board flying their colours in the Tornado class. However Brouwer figured her chances of pursuing a gold would be better served under the Belgian flag. So Dutch or Belgian? \"I'm both\", she says and is treated as \"one of the blokes\" by Tornado sailors, although the men \"don't like me beating them\".</p> <p>And here is where the complications really kick in, for although Brouwer and Godefroid remain the best of sailing mates, Carolijn has since switched her affairs of the heart to Australian Darren Bundock, the six times world champion and her fianc\u00e9e, who will be sailing against her in a pairing with Glenn Ashby - expected to be one of the leading challengers for Tornado gold.</p> <p>\"It's hard,\" admitted Brouwer, who finished second in the world championships last year. \"Between Seb and me there is history and obviously I'm now with Darren. We hadn't planned it this way. These are things that just happen and you cannot control it. Darren is pretty quiet and laid back, and concentrates on his own thing. We have both been around the sport a long time, and just leave each other in peace. I'm happy to be sailing for Belgium. I'll always be grateful to the Dutch for the support they have given me. But this is a natural thing to be happening in sport nowadays.\"</p> <p>After making its debut in the Montreal Games 32 years ago, this will be the last appearance of the multi-hull Tornado class - a catamaran competition where men and women can race alongside each other on an even basis - at the Olympics. \"I think this will be my last Olympics, not so much because I think I'm getting old and should stop, but because there is just no other option for me,\" Brouwer said. \"It's a shame because I would really have loved to have done another four years.\"</p>",
  "<p>The law governing how lapdancing clubs are licensed needs to be changed to make it harder for them to open in unsuitable locations, council leaders said today.</p> <p>The local government association released a letter it has sent to ministers saying that lapdancing clubs should be treated as \"sex encounter establishments\" for licensing purposes.</p> <p>At the moment, under the Licensing Act 2003, lapdancing clubs are in the same category as bars and cafes. But that means councils are not allowed to consider the kind of customers they might attract, or the suitability to a location, when deciding whether or not to issue a licence.</p> <p>\"The new licensing laws were intended to give local people more of a say on how pubs and clubs are run in their area, but when it comes to lapdancing establishments councils often find there is little they can do to respond to people's wishes,\" Sir Jeremy Beecham, the vice chairman of the LGA, said in the letter.</p> <p>The letter was released to the media on the day a government consultation on the issue comes to a close. </p> <p>In June, licensing minister Gerry Sutcliffe wrote to every council in England and Wales for their views on the licensing of lapdancing clubs. </p> <p>The LGA said that there are now around 300 lapdancing clubs in Britain, around double the number there were in 2003. Council leaders want them included in the same licensing category as sex shops and sex cinemas under the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 - venues where nude entertainment is provided for the purpose of sexual stimulation. </p> <p>Object and the Fawcett Society, groups which both campaign for women's rights, have called for legislation to close this loophole to be introduced in the coming parliamentary session. </p> <p>Object's director Dr Sasha Rakoff said: \"Many local authorities have added their voice to growing calls for an end to licensing of lapdancing clubs as cafes. </p> <p>\"Current licensing has acted as a floodgate to the industry whilst making it difficult for local authorities and local people to have a say in this process. </p> <p>\"It has helped normalise la dancing clubs and attitudes that encourage seeing women as sex objects, not people. </p> <p>\"The solution to this problem does not lie in tinkering with the Licensing Act 2003 or in planning controls. The solution lies in licensing lapdancing clubs for what they are: venues that provide visual entertainment for sexual stimulation - in other words, sex encounter establishments. </p> <p>\"We call on the government to restore democracy to the licensing process and send out a powerful message that buying a lapdance is not the same as buying a cappuccino.\" </p> <p>Fawcett Society campaigns officer Kat Banyard added: \"A lax licensing regime has led to the proliferation of lapdancing clubs in UK. </p> <p>\"Straitjacketed by the Licensing Act 2003, local authorities have been powerless to stop the spread. </p> <p>\"They are compelled to license lapdance clubs like cafes - despite having a very different social impact. </p> <p>\"Lapdance clubs fuel a sexist culture of treating women as sex objects. Areas surrounding lapdance clubs can become 'no-go' areas for women. </p> <p>\"The only viable solution is to license lapdancing clubs as sex encounter establishments.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Whose idea was it?</strong></p> <p>The identity-card plan has a long history. Michael Howard was in favour in his days as home secretary in the 1990s and, when Labour came to power, Jack Straw floated that idea of a \"citizen's access card\".</p> <p>After the September 11 attacks in 2001, David Blunkett, the then-home secretary, began to promote it heavily, although it took him some time to persuade his cabinet colleagues.</p> <p><strong>What are the cards supposed to achieve?</strong></p> <p>Home secretaries such as Howard and Blunkett have been attracted to identity cards as a weapon in the fight against crime, and some police organisations are in favour on these grounds too. It has been argued that identity cards could help the authorities target terrorists, serious criminals using false identities, welfare fraudsters and illegal immigrants.</p> <p>But the government now puts far less emphasis on this argument, partly because the terrorists involved in 9/11 and 7/7 were not using false identities and partly because cards would only work as anti-crime devices if they were compulsory, which raises another problem altogether (see below).</p> <p>Increasingly ministers now argue that identity cards will serve as a consumer facility for people who need to prove their identity when opening bank accounts, etc. </p> <p><strong>What powers does the government have?</strong></p> <p>The main enabling legislation, the Identity Cards Act, went through parliament two years ago and is now law. But it gave ministers considerable discretion as to how they implement the scheme. Gordon Brown has also said that parliament will vote before the introduction of a compulsory scheme.</p> <p><strong>What does the scheme involve?</strong></p> <p>More than just having a bit of plastic. The identity card itself would be linked to a national identity database which would contain dozens of pieces of information, such as photographs, national insurance numbers, dates of birth and addresses. It would also include biometric information \u2013 fingerprints.</p> <p><strong>When will they come in?</strong></p> <p>Foreigners from outside the EU will need to register their biometric details from later this year. From 2009 the scheme will be extended to people working in high-risk areas, such as airports. From 2010 they will be offered to students. And from 2011 they will be offered to people renewing their passports.</p> <p><strong>Why students?</strong></p> <p>The government believes that they will be attracted by the idea of having identity cards because, as they open bank accounts and rent property, they have a particular need to be able to prove their identity.</p> <p><strong>Will the cards be compulsory?</strong></p> <p>They will be for non-EU migrants and for workers in high-risk areas. For British citizens they will not exactly be compulsory, but it will be impossible to get a passport without putting your details on the database, so, in practice, for anyone wanting to travel abroad, they will be.</p> <p><strong>Will the database be safe?</strong></p> <p>That depends who you believe. The government says that the information will only be accessible to \"highly security-cleared individuals\". But the recent security lapses with data have highlighted how easy it is for things to go wrong and today's revelations about the problems with fingerprints for those over the age of 75 have illustrated another potential problem.</p>",
  "<p><br> Mickey Rourke in 2005. Photo: Francois Guillot/AFP/Getty Image</p> <p>Little so warms the soul as a genuine, copper-bottomed comeback story. All the more cheering, therefore, to find buzz building among the blogs that we may shortly be witnessing two for the price of one - each emerging in a cloud of steroidal rage via The Wrestler, a tale of mayhem in the ring directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring Mickey Rourke.</p> <p>It is, let's face it, a marriage of material, film-maker and actor so implausible a moment of silent pause might be advisable just to digest it. And yet, having sailed into the programmes of several of this autumn's festivals, <a href=\"http://theplaylist.blogspot.com/2008/08/clint-eastwoods-changeling-and-darren.html\">the Playlist among others</a> has begun to suspect there may be just be a triumph waiting to be discovered beneath the (vast) curiosity factor. And for whatever it might be worth, my own instinct here agrees - I peer at <a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Ne5Lb2SiFHg/SKHurAs36lI/AAAAAAAAPQs/9Cnj_m3sBeI/s1600-h/wrestler2.jpg\">the still of a bloodied, metal-haired Rourke reeling against the ropes</a> (craftsmanlike detail: a placard in the crowd reading \"Necrobutcher sucks a fat dick\"), and somehow, the entire thing clicks into place.</p> <p>Aronofsky alone is, of course, a second act waiting to happen; the New York wunderkind who broke through with his pristine debut Pi and operatic follow-up Requiem for a Dream before wasting all momentum on fruitless attempts to jump-start what would later (in the hands of Christopher Nolan) become the re-tooled Batman franchise. After still more frustration, he finally made The Fountain, a lumbering exercise in metaphysical sci-fi that should have been sub-titled The Career Killer. For an obvious talent with a large commercial black mark beside his name, hobbled by his compulsion to expand the language of cinema every time he ordered coffee, The Wrestler seemed at first pure industry penance: a real-life echo of the fate of the Coens' Barton Fink, tasked by his studio paymasters with writing a lunk-headed grappling picture (\"there's plenty of poetry right inside that ring, Fink\").</p> <p>Bad vibes were not dispelled by news the project was to star Nicolas Cage, a performer in who no amount of garish spandex could disguise an ever-more dislikable hangdog pomposity. But through the mysteries of A-list career strategies, Aronofsky was delivered a priceless gift when Cage almost instantly dropped out - and the central role instead fell to Rourke.</p> <p>For with that one turn of events, what appeared a disaster-in-the-making now made absolute sense. A director too smart for his own good would return to the kind of traditional narrative that, for all their aesthetic jiggery-pokery, both his first two movies had quietly relied on - with an actor who had surely now found the role he was born to play. A crazed variant of the Rocky blueprint, shacked up not with the saintly Adrian but an aging stripper, risking a fatal heart attack for the fabled one last fight, old and scarred-up and staggering on... it all fits Rourke so flawlessly it seems bizarre not so much that Cage was cast ahead of him, but that <em>any</em> other actor could have been.</p> <p>His mid-80s stardom derailed by bad decisions and unworthy behaviour before the long wilderness years of cosmetic surgery and small dog ownership, Rourke's own deeply baroque biography is the perfect match for the supersized lunacy of pro wrestling, his comeback as a leading man a mirror held up to the part itself. And yet, more importantly, in Rourke the film also acquired a figure who can act the guts out of a movie. For all the kitsch-machismo, when the mood or the material takes him, I'm not sure there are many other actors in film today who can mine quite the same seam of corrosive regret and shambling self-knowledge (if you don't believe me, check out his film-stealing one-minute cameo in Sean Penn's The Pledge, or every second of Barfly).</p> <p>Possessed of a personal back story beyond the most over-heated scriptwriter and the ability to almost casually stroll off with a film, though I'm not sure he'd thank me for saying it, Mickey Rourke is pretty much everything I like about Hollywood. As such, I can't wait for The Wrestler; and frankly, anyone who wishes to take issue with that can go and join the Necrobutcher.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Another gold for Phelps</strong></p> <p>[Beijinger presses CTRL C, then CTRL V] Another day, another gold medal for Michael Phelps. And, yes, another world record too. This time Phelps, the man whose pancakes and pizza diet is an inspiration to lorry drivers everywhere, took the 200m individual medley in a time of 1:54.23 to earn him his sixth medal of the Games. Meanwhile Great Britain's swimmers continued their habit of making the final but finishing outside the medals: James Goddard was sixth in 1:59.24 while Liam Tancock came eighth in 2:00.76.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the Americans finally won gold in the gymnastics. But it was not All-American girl and world champion Shawn Johnson who won the women's individual all-round, but her room-mate Nastia Liukin. When asked how she felt, Liukin, whose father and coach Valeri won two gold medals for the Soviets in Seoul and whose mother, Anna Kotchneva, was world rhythmic gymnastic champion, admitted she was in \"shock\" - along with many of the crowd in the National Indoor arena at the sight of a non-Chinese winner.</p> <p>Meanwhile the athletics is under way. Kelly Sotherton began her attempt<br>to win a second Olympic medal with a lifetime best in the 100m hurdles before faltering in the high jump (see below), but most people's eyes were on the Bird's Nest where the 100m heats got under way. There were few surprises as Asafa Powell shrugged off a stomach upset to join Usain Bolt, Tyson Gay and the particularly impressive Tyrone Edgar in the second round - unless you count Britain's Craig Pickering (10.21) and Simeon Williamson (10.42) also making it through.</p> <p><strong>Latest news</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://guardianmail.co.uk/go.asp?/bGUA001/q8S6UP8/xATO3P8\">Sotherton falters after great start</a><br>After recording a PB in the 100m hurdles, Kelly Sotherton performed<br>miserably in the high jump on the first morning of the heptathlon.</p> <p><a href=\"http://guardianmail.co.uk/go.asp?/bGUA001/qZAX3P8/xATO3P8\">Favourites breeze through in 100m</a><br>Tyrone Edgar was, somewhat surprisingly, the quickest in the first round of the 100m, easing off as he recorded a time of 10.15.</p> <p><a href=\"http://guardianmail.co.uk/go.asp?/bGUA001/qHSFLP8/xATO3P8\">Phelps records win No6</a><br>Michael Phelps made it six out of six - both in terms of gold medals and<br>world records - with another crushing victory in the 200m individual<br>medley.

  "<p>People aged 50 and over, but especially the old and frail, are not receiving basic standards of healthcare, according to new research.</p> <p>Experts found shortfalls in the quality of care offered by the NHS and private providers to patients with conditions such as osteoarthritis, incontinence and osteoporosis.</p> <p>But they found that doctors paid particular attention to conditions where assessments earned them extra money, including heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure.</p> <p>Dr Nick Steel, the senior lecturer in primary care at the University of East Anglia, who led the study, said: \"One of the conditions that came out worst was osteoarthritis, where we asked people if they'd received basic advice such as doing exercises to control the condition, and whether they had effective pain relief.</p> <p>\"At the more severe end of the scale, for those with severe osteoarthritis, we asked if they had been given the opportunity to see a specialist to talk about joint replacement.</p> <p>\"There were also issues around whether elderly patients had been asked the reason for their falls. These types of areas did not fare so well in the study.\"</p> <p>The research, published in the British Medical Journal, found the quality of healthcare for people with common health conditions \"varied substantially by condition\".</p> <p>Scores on the quality of care ranged from 83% for heart disease to 29% for osteoarthritis.</p> <p>Overall, only 62% of the care recommended for people aged 50 and over is actually received in England, the research found.</p> <p>The study, which involved 8,688 people, examined 13 different health conditions including heart disease, diabetes, stroke, depression and osteoarthritis.</p> <p>A series of questionnaires and face-to-face interviews were used and the findings assessed against a series of markers on the quality of care, approved by a medical panel.</p> <p>These included established guidelines on managing conditions, comparable to those issued by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice).</p> <p>The researchers found substantially more care was provided for general medical conditions (74%) than for geriatric conditions (57%), including falls, osteoarthritis, urinary incontinence, cataract problems, hearing problems and osteoporosis.</p> <p>Conditions that come under the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) - which give incentives to GPs - received better attention. In 75% of such cases, people got the right treatment.</p> <p>Steel said it could not be concluded that care for people with conditions outside the QOF had got worse, but it was not improving in line with conditions included in GPs' contracts.</p> <p>People were far more likely to receive screening and preventative care (80%) than treatment and follow-up care (64%) or diagnostic care (60%), the study found.</p> <p>The authors concluded: \"Shortfalls in receipt of basic recommended care by adults aged 50 or more with common health conditions in England were most noticeable in areas associated with disability and frailty, but few areas were exempt.</p> <p>\"Efforts to improve care have substantial scope to achieve better health outcomes and particularly need to include chronic conditions that affect quality of life of older people.\"</p> <p>Gordon Lishman, the director general of Age Concern, said: \"These figures show that age discrimination within the NHS is still rife.</p> <p>\"The rewards system for GPs to treat particular conditions has worked - but this hasn't included health problems older people particularly suffer from like depression, falls, and vision and hearing problems.</p> <p>Kate Jopling, the head of public affairs at Help the Aged, said: \"These depressing results show that, when it comes to healthcare, all too often older people and the conditions that affect them come far down the pecking order.</p> <p>\"This kind of ageist treatment is precisely why legislation against age discrimination is needed.</p> <p>\"The government has announced this will form part of the forthcoming equality bill but no timeframe or process has been agreed - until that happens, older people will continue to be short changed by the health service.\"</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Arthritis Research Campaign said: \"We know that many older people with osteoarthritis are often fobbed off by GPs and told: 'It's your age you've got to live with it', rather than being offered practical advice on weight loss, exercise and pain relief, or a referral to see a physiotherapist.</p> <p>\"Standards of care vary enormously around the country and it's simply unacceptable.\"</p> <p>The Department of Health said: \"Older people have a right to high quality care, regardless of their age.</p> <p>\"It is unacceptable for them to be treated any differently. Our recent Darzi review sets out a framework for improving the quality of care for everybody that uses the NHS.</p> <p>\"A lot of progress has been made already with the treatment and care of older people but we recognise more can be done.</p> <p>\"We have recently started work on providing an increased focus on preventative care for older people. The prevention package will include an expert group to help the NHS better provide services for falls, fractures and osteoporosis.\"</p>",
  "<p>America has a new public enemy \u2013 oil speculators.

So it taped the event and showed it \"as live\" at peak evening viewing time 12 hours later.</p> <p>While millions around the world were treated to elaborately choreographed drummers, the lighting of the flame and flag-carrying teams of athletes, Americans were subjected to a media black-out. NBC adopted a stazi-like approach to any websites which tried to break its monopoly.</p> <p>In a bizarre charade, anchormen from NBC's business offshoot, CNBC, presented part of their morning news show from a camera position outside the Beijing's \"bird's nest\" stadium but they had to pretend there was nothing going on inside. </p> <p>Even when a massive fireworks display turned the sky red directly behind them, they kept a straight face and completely ignored the bangs as <a href=\"http://tvdecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/11/olympics-pay-no-attention-to-those-fireworks-behind-the-anchorman/\">this marvellous screenshot</a> demonstrates.</p> <p>It all seems a bit of a shame.

It's quite common to see stores wasting energy in this way at the height of the Big Apple's scorching summer. If the bill goes through, first-time offenders will get a warning. Second time, it's a $200 fine and the third time, the cost goes up to $400. Bang to rights.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hello Sam</strong><br>[In an accent that falls somewhere between West Country soy-der and pony-club posh, with just a hint of Montreal twang thrown in] Hello, Small Talk.</p> <p><strong>Right, let's get this out of the way early doors - have you ever met, been in the same room as, or had anything ever to do with, Zara Phillips?</strong><br>Yes I have.</p> <p><strong>And what's she like?</strong><br>She's very good fun.</p> <p><strong>Are you ever fed up of being asked questions about her and the attention that she gets compared to everyone else?</strong><br>No, not really because in our sport there's ... I mean, she's like everyone else, you know, she falls off like everyone else.</p> <p><strong>Excellent - Small Talk has now fulfilled his journalistic contractual obligations for writing anything about equestrianism. Moving on, what sort of training did you do in preparation for the Games? Is it all just horse-based?</strong><br>I have done some running, I sort of try to keep myself fit, but really I've got two children as well so by the time I've done them in the day and ridden all my horses I don't really feel like doing anything in the evening. You don't really build yourself up for the riding aspect aside from just doing it really.</p> <p><strong>With it being your first Games, are you more nervous or excited?</strong><br>Umm ... it's very exciting to finally live your dream, you know? Everybody dreams of riding at the Olympics or competing at the Olympics and I just want to get going really.</p> <p><strong>Is it slightly annoying that the equestrian events are held in Hong Kong rather than Beijing?</strong><br>Well, it is, I mean, you know, to us it's probably just like normal championship three-day events where all the riders are in the same hotel and everything, so I would have preferred obviously to have had the Olympic village and everything else. They are trying to make things like the Olympic village - we've got our own hotel and it's all sealed off to the public and only accredited officials can go in there - but it's not the same. I remember going to Atlanta and my ex-partner was riding there and we went into the Olympic village with all the basketball players and the gymnasts and it was just fantastic and I will miss staying on that side of things. Whether I keep going to London so I can experience that side of it, I don't know.</p> <p><strong>It would certainly be a lot more local for you.</strong><br>Yeah, it would be a lot easier, it would!</p> <p><strong>Your horse is called Before I Do It. What's behind the name?</strong><br>It was my ex-mother-in-law and all of her horses had 'Do It' in their name. We had May I Do It, I May Do It, Better I Do It, Believe me I Do It ... there's a superstition that you don't change a horse's name so she got stuck with it I'm afraid. Poor girl!</p> <p><strong>So in the events how much is down to the horse and how much of it is down to the rider - is it a 50-50 relationship?</strong><br>Well, I mean, I couldn't do it without my horse and she couldn't do it without me. There are a lot of horses out there who can't make it to that level. My horse is physically \u2026 well, she's not built to do it but she's got a huge heart and that's what makes her do it for me. She tries so hard; even if she's struggling she'll keep trying for me. There's a lot of very, very talented horses that just don't have the heart and if they don't want to do it, one rider on top is not going to be able to make them to do it. So, it's a partnership really at the end of the day.</p> <p><strong>Do you end up have a quite close relationship with the horse, sort of sensing each others moves?</strong><br>Yeah, definitely. I mean, I know her and she knows me. I know now that you don't go and hug her and trouble her until she's fit \u2013 she's very touchy and twitchy. You just leave her alone in her own space and you don't bother her. Other times you're walking in and she's pulling you and she wants some reassurance and a hug, so you go in and make a fuss of her.</p> <p><strong>So, you're the first Jamaican equestrian Olympian - that must be a source of real pride for you?</strong><br>Well it is, it's lovely. I just wish I was in Jamaica to enjoy the coverage that I'm getting out there as well. My mum rings me all the time and tells me 'oh, an article came out' or 'I heard you on the radio'. But it is lovely.</p> <p><strong>You were born in Canada to a Jamaican mother and English father so who do you support when the football's on?</strong><br>Well, Jamaica if we're in it, definitely. I call Jamaica my home even though I've lived in England for 18 years but Jamaica is always my home. Even though I was born in Canada I wouldn't consider myself Canadian. I still consider myself Jamaican.</p> <p><strong>How did you get into horse riding? It's not exactly the first thing you associate with the Caribbean.</strong><br>Well, when we lived in Canada my dad took my two sisters and I to a riding school \u2013 I think they were six and five and I was three \u2013 and one couldn't stand the smell and the other was allergic to horses and I just loved it. I would drag my dad there every weekend to go and sit on these horses and eventually I convinced my dad to buy us a horse and he used to ride it and I would sit on a little cushion at the front. So I think it was definitely my dad's influence at the beginning since he was very supportive.</p> <p><strong>Don't you ever wake up and think 'I can't look at another horse today'?</strong><br>No, I've never had that actually.</p> <p><strong>So you're very much in love with the sport?</strong><br>Yeah, I can't imagine my life without horses. I couldn't live without them I have to say.</p> <p><strong>Right, enough of the horsey stuff, let's get down to serious business - what was the last CD you bought?</strong><br>It's quite embarrassing \u2026 to tell the truth it was Neil Diamond. My Gran gave me a ticket for my birthday to see Neil Diamond so I thought I had better get myself up to date with his tunes. But my children were so appalled! When I played his music they wouldn't let me have my windows down in the car.</p> <p><strong>Tickets from your Gran? A likely story. What was the last book you read?</strong><br>It would have to be a Danielle Steele. I only read trash - I don't read anything too serious.</p> <p><strong>Who would play you in a film of your life?</strong><br>Oh God \u2026 it would have to be someone very gorgeous, so it makes me look nice. Maybe Julia Roberts or somebody really nice like that.</p> <p><strong>Who do you think would win a fight between a lion and a tiger?</strong></p> <p>[The line, very abruptly goes, dead. Small Talk wonders if the lion v tiger question has pushed things too far. Perhaps she's so enraged that she can't even bear to admonish Small Talk for his idiotic questions. She must be furious. Yet she seemed so nice. Phone her back. No, she's enraged. That'd only make things worse. Oh God, Small Talk what have you done? This is a nightm ...]</p> <p>[Small Talk's phone rings]</p> <p>[Not at all enraged or even the slightest bit furious] Sorry about that Small Talk, not sure what happened there. I'll say a lion - they're much stronger, I think.</p> <p><strong>Daniel Craig or Pierce Brosnan?</strong><br>Pierce Brosnan.</p> <p><strong>Ah, the sophisticated choice. Cheese or chocolate?</strong><br>Cheese. Any kind really.</p> <p><strong>And what would you put in Room 101?</strong><br>Er ... [Small Talk explains the Orwellian concept, with reference to Paul Merton and Nick Hancock] ... I know what I would like to say but I don't think I can say it! My ex-husband! I had better not say that, I might get in big trouble for that one. Hopefully he won't read it.</p> <p><strong>Last of all, can you tell us a joke?</strong><br>Oh God, no I'm terrible at jokes. The children always want me to tell jokes and I'm terrible, I always get it all mixed up. I can't tell you a joke I'm afraid.</p> <p><strong>Never mind, Sam. Thanks for taking the time to talk to us</strong><br>No problem, Small Talk. Bye!</p>",
  "<p>A Briton and four fellow activists are being deported from China today after unveiling a Free Tibet banner opposite a landmark new building for the state broadcaster.</p> <p>Phil Kirk, 24, from Basingstoke, scaled an Olympics billboard facing the China Central Television (CCTV) site at around dawn and dropped a banner with both English and Chinese slogans.</p> <p>A second climber, with Australian-Canadian nationality, and three American support people were also detained by police within half an hour.</p> <p>Other members of Students for a Free Tibet have been unable to contact them but the state news agency Xinhua quoted local police as ordering them \"to curtail their stay in China and leave the country earlier\".

In this case, ideally, if there is time before the kick is taken, you must intervene and stop play, and make sure the mascot moves away. The player is also within his rights to stop his run-up and ask you to deal with the dinosaur.<br><strong>3)</strong> You cannot reverse your decision, and nor should you.

  "<p>What was the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/155500.stm\">Prague Spring</a>, or the events of 1968 more generally? Their meaning, it seems, has become more, not less, debatable with the passage of time. </p> <p>My generation was forged by protests and police truncheons, by the hopes generated not only by the Prague Spring, but also by the <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/globalisation/the_polish_march_students_workers_and_1968\">Polish student movement</a> that March, the Paris events of May, and the first signs of Russian democracy voiced in the early books of Sakharov and Solzhenitsyn. For those of us imprisoned in Poland, the Prague Spring was a harbinger of hope. Even Poland's communist newspapers, read behind bars, somehow conveyed news of the great changes taking place in our neighbour to the south. </p> <p>So I remember my shock when I learned about the Soviet <a href=\"http://www.lib.umich.edu/spec-coll/czech/\">invasion of Czechoslovakia</a> in August, and the trauma that lingered long after. On the 10th anniversary of that invasion, V\u00e1clav Havel, Jacek Kuron, and I, along with other dissidents, met on the Czech-Polish border. There is a photograph of that occasion: future presidents, ministers, and parliamentarians who were at that time pursued by the police like common criminals. </p> <p>These encounters were an extension of the climate of the Prague Spring. We all felt that we were creating something new, something that might, one day, turn out to be an important component of democracy in our countries. </p> <p>And so it was. In August 1989, I proposed in the Polish diet a draft resolution apologising to the Czechs and Slovaks for Polish involvement in the 1968 invasion. I felt that a historical circle was being closed: the ideas of the Polish March and the Prague Spring, the ideas of our mountain meetings, were becoming political facts. Three months later, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_Revolution\">Velvet Revolution</a> began in Prague. </p> <p>The main difference between the Prague Spring and the Velvet Revolution was that the former was mostly the work of Communist party members and others who wanted to bring about \"socialism with a human face.\" As a result, some people nowadays dismiss the Prague Spring as a power struggle between communists. But there were many roads to \u2013 and through \u2013 communism, and many of them converged with national traditions. </p> <p>Indeed, communism was attractive for many reasons, including the idea of universal justice and humanised social relations; a response to the great spiritual crisis after the first world war and, later, to the Nazis' genocide; and the conviction that western dominance of the world was nearing its end. Finally, in a world divided by Yalta, communism was, for some, the only realistic choice for central Europe. </p> <p>In Czechoslovakia in 1968, communist reformers appealed to democratic ideals that were deeply rooted in the country's pre-second world war past. Alexander Dubcek, the leader of the Czechoslovak communists and the symbol of the Prague Spring, personified hope for democratic evolution, real pluralism, and a peaceful way to a state governed by law and respectful of human rights. </p> <p>By contrast, in Poland, which had witnessed its own tentative opening in the March student movement, a nationalist-authoritarian faction exploited all that was intolerant and ignorant in Polish tradition, employing xenophobia and anti-intellectual rhetoric. Mieczyslaw Moczar, the Polish interior minister and leader of the nationalist faction, combined communist rhetoric with a language proper to fascist movements in order to mobilise the masses against the \"cosmopolitan-liberal intelligentsia.\" </p> <p>The Polish freedom movement of 1968 lost its confrontation with police violence; the Prague Spring was crushed by the armies of five Warsaw Pact members. But in both countries, 1968 gave birth to a new political consciousness. The Polish and Czech opposition movements that emerged only a few years later had their roots in the events of 1968. </p> <p>Attitudes towards communism were always a controversial subject for the anticommunist opposition. Some rejected communism in all its forms. The majority though, in one way or another, had some contact with communism, through intellectual fascination, participation in state institutions, or the cold conviction that only by accepting the reality of life under communism could one do something useful for one's country. These people, \"tainted by communism\", constituted the majority of the participants in all revolts against the communist dictatorships. </p> <p>There was, however, another category of people: the \"careful and untainted\", who absented themselves from the world of politics. They hated communism, but, convinced that the system could not be reformed, they avoided the democratic opposition. While others took risks or sat in jails, they functioned in official and legal structures. </p> <p>One should not blame anyone today for such behaviour. But it is surprising when these people accuse participants in the Prague Spring and the democratic opposition of links with communism. </p> <p>Communism was obviously an instrument of Soviet domination over conquered societies, but it was also a modus vivendi for large parts of these nations under the conditions in which they were obliged to live. </p> <p>The Prague Spring appealed to elementary values: freedom, pluralism, tolerance, sovereignty, and rejection of the dictates of communist orthodoxy. When I recall these events after 40 years, I see not only revolt, but also the great illusion that it might be possible to outfox the Kremlin and painlessly move society from communism to democracy. This belief was naive, but it also underpinned a national awakening in which the potential for freedom found its voice. </p> <p>In cooperation with <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008</p>",

  "<p>A double medallist from North Korea was this morning expelled from the Olympic Village after testing positive for drugs.</p> <p>Kim Jong-su won silver in the 50m pistol event and bronze in the 10m air pistol. But in an in-competition dope test - which the International Olympic Committee has been conducting for all medallists here - Kim was found to have taken the illegal beta-blocker propranolol.</p> <p>A three-man disciplinary panel met this morning and stripped him of his medals. It led to China's Zonglian Tan being promoted to the 50m pistol silver, with Vladimir Isakov now taking the bronze. The air pistol bronze now goes to the US's Jason Turner.</p> <p>\"Propranolol is a beta-blocker and banned in certain events, the precision sports such as shooting and archery,\" said Professor Arne Ljunqvist, the chairman of the IOC's medical commission.</p> <p>\"This was found in Kim's system. I interpret that it was a deliberate intake because of the importance it has in that sport. The consequences are obvious.\"</p> <p>Kim's positive test was the second of these Games after the Spanish road cyclist Maria Isabel Moreno was stripped of her Olympic accreditation on Tuesday. The IOC also declared a third incident, involving the 59th-ranked artistic gymnast Thi Ngan Thuong Do, from Vietnam, who was found to have taken the diuretic furocemide and also expelled from the Games.</p> <p>Ljunqvist had more sympathy for Thi, whose drug test was for a substance that is used to control pre-menstrual tension. He explained that she was likely to have been ill advised on what to avoid and what she could take.</p> <p>With only three tests so far during this Olympics, Ljunqvist was claiming triumph for the IOC's doping policy. When asked if the relatively low number of positive tests might suggest that the dopers are beating the system, he said: \"The evidence shows we are ahead of the cheats. My interpretation is that three positive tests is fairly low.</p> <p>\"You would expect six or seven tests. This is a feature of increased awareness in the sports population. The figures are encouraging rather than showing anything else.\"</p> <p>Ljunqvist explained what the IOC considers to be an effective testing information system developed over the past seven years by the World Anti-Doping Agency, whose health, medical and research committee he chairs. But there remains scepticism about the efficacy of the testing regime at the Beijing Games, with a Polish swimming coach labelling the tests of some Chinese swimmers \"irrational\".</p> <p>The IOC was indignant. \"I don't think officials should enter into speculation like that and unfairly question the achievements of athletes in Beijing,\" said Ljunqvist. \"It is not fair, particularly from people who have official positions in national teams.\"</p>",
  "<p>Britain's unhappy experience at the archery field came to a sour end as Alan Wills, the best and last hope for a medal, lost to the 39-year old Cuban Juan Carlos Stevens and then said that his relationship with coach Peter Suk was not working.</p> <p>Wills led going into the final end, but Stevens finished 10, 10, 10, meaning that Wills's last arrow, after 9 and 8, was meaningless. The 27-year old from County Durham claimed that he wanted to go out and shoot aggressively, but that Suk, who came to Britain from Korea via the Italian women's team, was preaching calmness.</p> <p>Other Koreans found themselves in trouble. Out at the same stage in the morning went two of their remaining three archers, including Im Dong-Hyun, the reigning world champion, knocked out by Victor Wunderle of the US. Wunderle took on not just the No1-ranked player but also the clock, taking its 30-second countdown to the last tick before shooting.</p> <p>It jangled everyone's nerves, bar his own. As Im came back at him in the final end with two 10s and a 9, Wunderle, a hunting, fishing, pistol-shooting 32-year-old from Mason City, Illinois, held his stress levels in check and his lead intact for a two-point win.</p> <p>Earlier, Lee Chang-Hwan had lost to Cheng Chu Sian of Malaysia, reducing the Koreans in the crowd, the only replete section of the stadium, to silence. They had only their ice-man Park Kyung-Mo left. Not good enough, was the Korean take on their own. And Wills's on his own Korean.</p>",

Over to strong, strong runner Alan Gardner.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>5.49am: 'Sup?</strong> Big praise indeed from Russell... I've been limbering up in the background, and he must have noticed my impressive calves. Although, my desk-accustomed frame has got nothing on either the gymnasts or the beach volleyballers who are currently occupying my attention. And I think the US girls have just nailed their routines in the women's all-around. Is it going to be a dainty slap upside the head for China?</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>5.54am:</strong> Chants of <strong>USA! USA! USA!</strong> in the National Indoor Stadium. Shawn Johnson, the pint-sized princess of American gymnastics - who appears to have been confected entirely from pink satin and sunbeams - is lapping up the applause. Blue Peter's Matt Baker doesn't think she's quite done enough though...</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>5.57am: USA! USA! USA! take gold... and silver.</strong> China will have to suck their thumb whilst clutching bronze. Baker called it: Johnson had to settle for second; but Nastia Liukin, also a Yank, picked up gold. <strong>Britain's Becky Downie finished a respectable 12th.</strong></p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>6.00am: Psychedelic cartoon alert.</strong> Must mean it's time for Olympic Breakfast, with the Beeb's finest.

As for the overall medals count, roll on 2012, eh?\"</p> <p>Well, Adrian, may I point you in the direction of this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympicscycling\">little section of our site</a>? On yer bike, mate.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>6.10am:</strong> Not a whole lorra 'lympics going on at the moment, as far as I can tell, not least because BBC1 have decided that some events in this country are in some way newsworthy, which I doubt, frankly. Anyway, as part of their services to japery and clowning around, those zany Spaniards have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/15/olympics2008.olympicstennis\">been at it again</a>. When will they learn...?</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>6.13am: Team GB sailing</strong> You'd have thought with all the corporate suits and politico types guffing their way around Beijing, such a lack wouldn't be problematic, but <strong>we currently have no sailing over in Qingdao because there's no wind.</strong> Ainslie and the Yngling girls are cooling their heels, and possibly drinking some lovely, lovely green tea.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>6.17am: Team GB athletics</strong> Yes, that does read athletics. Kelly Sotherton, one of only two people in Britain who can run without her legs falling off, is doing a cracking job over in the heptathlon. Last I heard she'd gone over 1.77m in the high jump, but it looks like she may have just bettered that.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>6.20am:</strong> Sotherton knocks the bar off at 1.83m, but I think, in going over 1.80m, she's already set a new PB. The American, Hayleas Fountain leads after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/15/olympics2008.britisholympicteam1\">storming through the 100m hurdles this morning</a>. But Kelly's just floated over at 1.83m!!! G'wan Kel!</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>6.26am: Team GB archery</strong> Alan Wills' defeat in the men's singles is being re-lived on the Beeb, while Eurosport have gone with this morning's 100m heats.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Andrew Jolly has joined the Aussie de-baiting: \"Yes, as a Brit living in Australia, I've been talking up our cycling team whilst the Aussies sweep up at the swimming (except this morning where Libby &amp; Liesel threw it away). It's a good job choking isn't an attribute of supposedly superior British sports people. Eh? Oh.\" And some classic self-deprecation to round things off. Mr Jolly, you are wasted down there.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>6.31am:</strong> Seems the <a href=\"http://www.olympics.org.uk/beijing2008/AthleteProfile.aspx?id=5585\">Team GB website</a> tells lies about our Kelly, who has in fact jumped 1.87m before. Anyway, there's some judo going on, and some badminton... not that we have much interest in either now.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>6.34am: Acronym fun, with Al Parkes.</strong> \"As for yngling [cf. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/14/olympics2008.britisholympicteam1\">yesterday's MBM</a>, 7.15am], when faced with 'epee', and thinking it might be a typo, I googled it and the first thing that caught my eye was 'european partnership for energy and the environment'\" writes Al. \"Sounds worthy, but what do the participants actually do? Do they win points for the extent to which they 'reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the use of refrigerants'?\" Another convoluted Olympic sport in the offing, maybe.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>6.40am:</strong> Cuba and the US are locked at 2-2 in the <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=blurnsball\">blurnsball</a>. Still not enough wind for the sailors to have a paddle, so we're reduced to Uzbekistan v Poland in the men's judo.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>6.44am:</strong> Mr Jolly cranks up the pressure on the MBM team (me). \"For some reason, Channel 7 and SBS in Australia aren't covering the athletics today - at the moment we have the mouthwatering choice of Chinese Taipei vs Hong Kong in table tennis or Australia vs Holland in water polo (we don't have new fangled things like 'the red button') down under yet.\" Cue, dramatic music and scenes of MBMer perspiring profusely: \"We're relying completely on MBM to know how the lovely Kelly et al are getting on.\"</p> <p>Well, er... I, er, hang on... just let me switch the chann... bye!</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>6.50am: Fleeing MBMer hits electrified fence around Rebranded Website compound and is corralled back to his seat.</strong> Never fear, text-based sports commentary fans, I'm still here. Not much to report on viz. Ms Sotherton, as there are about 313 competitors in the heptathlon so the high jump wil be some time in finishing.</p> <p>More scandal news, however. According to Reuters, the Chinese faked the ethnicity of some of the kids at the opening ceremony. For shame.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>6.55am:</strong> More people in need, this time Amy from America and Max from Germany who are \"on hols without TV and are counting on you!\" Great. At least their request is simple. Yes, Amy and Max, Germany do have eight golds, our table is just reluctant to acknowledge the facts currently.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>7.00am:</strong> An Estonian judoka is trying to give his Brazilian opponent what looks like a chinese burn. Must be something in the Beijing air. Meanwhile, word is that Kel failed at 1.83m, so my earlier optimism was misplaced/erroneous.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>7.03am:</strong> Peru v Cuba on the mat... and Cuba hands out some ippon pain straight away. Still 2-2 in the baseball.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>7.07am:</strong> If you missed the exciting denouement to USA! USA! USA! crushing 'One World. One Dream' China in the gymnastics earlier, why not read the full report <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/15/olympicsgymnastics.olympics2008\">here</a>. The fun part is... wait for it, wait for it... really, a Russian won. What a delightful Cold War triptych, eh.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>7.12am: Are you listening, Australia? You're rubbish.</strong> Or words to that effect. \"As a Brit living in Brisbane, i'm wondering if the Aussies, following on from the rugby world cup - where the rules must now be changed so that a team with no scrum can win - will now float some ELVs for swimming,\" enquires John Davis, with a mischievous grin all over his mush. \"I mean the Americans getting from the start to the finish in the fastest time, whilst following a straight line, is something of a hollow victory isn't it?\"</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>7.17am: Chiles shows some love.</strong> The Beeb are running (Australian former world record holder) Leisel Jones choking in the 200m breaststroke again, from earlier this morning. But before that, we had Adrian Chiles flapping his chops about the Guardian and in particular <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/14/michaelphelps.swimming1\">this piece on Michael Phelps' diet</a>.

Can you contain your, etc and so forth...</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>7.25am:</strong> No sailing, remember, due to a lack of wind. The French judoka, who looks like a bear, is taking it to the Uzbeki, who looks like an accountant.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>7.35am:</strong> Some of our top stories now up in the standfirst, there. Bit of a newspapery word, standfirst. You and I can call it, 'slightly washed-out text beneath the headline', if you like.</p> <p>And news of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/15/olympics2008.drugsinsport\">some disqualifications for nasty drug cheats</a>, brought to you with nothing more than the pure blood, sweat and tears of the Guardian team.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>7.38am:</strong> Upstanding fellow and noble Englishman-on-foreign-shores Andrew Jolly is disappointed with the complete lack of 'bring it' being shown by Australian readers. \"Typical, they start off the sledging, fueled by weak beer and sunstroke, but as soon as a couple of Brits slap them around a bit back they go, retreating to the BBQ...\" complains Andy, who likes a sporting contest.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>7.44am: Sotherton watch</strong> It seems that in the confusion and to-and-fro of instantaneous reporting, Kelly did indeed clear 1.83m, but that wasn't quite up there with some of the best. <strong>She's lying in fifth, after the two events so far</strong>, and you can read some proper journalism on the subject <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/15/olympics2008.britisholympicteam1\">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>7.48am:</strong> The American with the barmy handle, Hyleas Fountain, is top o'the tree in the heptathlon. Clare Balding loves Kelly Sotherton \"because she's got attitude\". And cos she's such a feisty type, the bods on the BBC couch reckon she'll have been none too pleased about having to wait two hours to have a go on the high jump.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>7.56am:</strong> Brett Badger, who refuses to declare himself as an Australian but probably is, weighs in for the Sheilas: \"l must admit to being a little confused by all this British babble. Perhaps the medal tally l am looking at which shows Australia miles ahead of our Imperial Overlords is wrong?\" [at this point Badger, whose name sounds made up, proffers a link to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics/2008/medals/full\">Guardian medal table</a>, mocking us with our own fancy technology] \"Or am l to understand we are being criticised for not being further ahead of Team GB? OK, l guess that would fit in with the general self flagellating principles of British sport.\" It is customary to let the hare get well out in front before it is overhauled, Brett. In this case by a tortoise on an advanced carbon fibre bicycle.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>8.00am:</strong> While Gary Naylor endures a Kluft-less and therefore Sotherton-less broadcasting landscape in Sweden, I'm stuck with reruns and news segments. Oh, and USA 3-3 Cuba in the baseball. \"With no Kluft-mania to drive the coverage here in Sweden, television has cut away from the Bird's Nest and is now showing Germany vs Sweden in the women's handball,\" laments Gary. \"You wouldn't think it would be possible to make 14 super-fit, Amazonian, European women a-stretching and a-straining dull. But handball manages it.\" To be honest, I'd like to take an objective decision for myself on that one, but not even the internet can help me here (and don't get cheeky...)</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>8.10am: Team GB</strong> Up later, there'll be some rowing, with Zac Purchase and Mark Hunter in the men's lightweight double sculls. The cycling - also known as the basket in which I've placed all my eggs in a verbal spat with Australia - should start in an hour or so, where the Brits will be looking to vanquish the French.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>8.15am:</strong> Andrew Jolly, my partner in crimes against the Australian nation, is beginning to get the wobbles after Brett Badger's robust assault: \"We (the British) are going to look right stupid a bit later on if we all fall off [our bikes]. Actually, as we've talked it up a fair amount, we're going to look right stupid if we don't win 10 gold medals. Not that I'm stepping back towards my BBQ, Agincourt spirit and all that...\" Badger, real name or not, you've certainly brought it.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>8.23am: Team GB athletics</strong> Marilyn Okoro and Jenni Meadows both qualified for the 800m earlier. Not sure we mentioned Marilyn at the time. There's one track gold up for grabs today, but it's not till much later (3.45pm BST).</p> <p>Oh, and in the Amazon-ball, it seems to be Germany 26-27 Sweden... but I'm not really sure how the scoring works. Maybe Gary Naylor can help?</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>8.29am:</strong> News on the baseball from Kyle Hauptman, who has Sydney and Tokyo numbers in his email signature, so I'm going to assume is approximately somewhere in the middle of the Philippines.</p> <p>China 8-7 Chinese Taipei<br>Cuba 5-4 USA</p> <p>The spectre of communism is haunting baseball, then. Or something.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>8.35am:</strong> Almost time for me to chuck in the towel and head home for some kip. Howard Swains will be taking over from me, and he's a stirling chap with a full head of glorious hair. Get ready though, cos some <strong>Brits appear to be out on the lake at Shunyi</strong>...</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>8.43am:</strong> OK, something got lost there in the transition in personnel, but it seems that Britain finished fifth in the lake which, ordinarily, is never good enough to qualify. I'll try to confirm that failure momentarily, but I think we can assume the British pair are out.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>8.47am: Prepared introduction:</strong> Morning again to all, and welcome back to Beijing, being brought to you via a tiny Hitachi screen and an uncertain internet connection channelling an uncertain web-stream. These are the mysteries unravelled.</p> <p>This is the greatest show on earth which, incidentally, is also the name of a song by the rather excellent <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zAioPRKmN4\">Felice Brothers</a> that appeared on my I-Pod this morning. \"I'm in a suit of burgundy/There's a deerhead lookin' at me/It's blowin my mind away.\" That is what it's like at Guardian Towers on day seven of the Olympics. </p> <p>Today's deerhead will be eyeing some canoe/kayaking, some archery, some judo, weightlifting, fencing, shot put, badminton, athletics (where Kelly Sotherton in the heptathlon is the main British attraction) and the chance of some British metal acquisition in the cycling. I haven't so far presided over a single British medal win, but have high hopes for today. The wind has even got up in the right place, offering the prospect of some sailing, and died down elsewhere, permitting some rowing, both of which were postponed yesterday.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://en.beijing2008.cn/\">official Beijing Olympics website</a> sometimes struggles to keep up with what's going on around the whole Games, which can throw us (OK, me) for a loop.</p> <p>Please send in your observations, comments, complaints and typo-spots to <a href=\"mailto:hswains@gmail.com\">hswains@gmail.com</a>.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>8.48am: Unprepared introduction:</strong> Some women rowers have just come fifth in the sculling and have not qualified for the final. \"We gave it our best shot and it's really, really gutting not to reach the final,\" says Helen Casey. Her ship-mate Hester Goodsell is similarly disappointed. \"We're just not quite there yet,\" she says. \"Have a good scull tomorrow,\" pipes up Steve Redgrave.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>8.51am:</strong> Turns out that this telly is actually a Tosumi, not a Hitachi as previously advertised. In the second <strong>sculling</strong> semi-final, Canada beat China who beat Greece.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>8.54am</strong> The British men have just started their semi-final in the double sculls. \"What a fascinating six minutes this will be,\" insists John Inverdale.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>8.58am:</strong> The British pair -- Zac Purchase and Mark Hunter -- are way out in front at the half-way mark, leading the Cubans, Italians and French boats. This one is in the bag.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>9.02am: Purchase and Hunter cruise into the final of the men's lightweight double sculls</strong> with a comfortable victory in the semi finals. Italy and Cuba come second and third. The final is not for another 48 hours, but there are now very high hopes for gold in the lake. </p> <p>This from table-tennis correspondent Tim Maitland: \"Alan teased us with a mention of the Hong Kong v Chinese Taipei table tennis match, without giving the result or capturing the humungous importance of it. Hong Kong's first medal of the Games! A 3-0 sweep of the-island-otherwise-known-as-Taiwan in the bronze medal match, sealed by Athens-silver-medal-winning legends Li Ching and Ko Lai-Chak in the doubles.\" That's that covered.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>9.03am: Drug cheat news: </strong> North Korean shooter Kim Jong Su has been stripped of his two medals for failing a drugs test. I'm actually not sure how \"new\" this news is, but I hadn't noticed it yet, even though there's an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/feedarticle/7726560\">article being fed onto the Guardian website about it</a>.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>9.10am:</strong> Here are our options for live coverage: Clare Balding in ravishing pink, women's 75kg weightlifting, women's team semi-final table tennis, boxing or sailing. Over to you. (Bear in mind that one email vote would probably win this.)</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>9.16am:</strong> I'm watching some sailing at the moment because there appear to be a British boat involved, skippered (is that the right word?) by Ben Ainslie, who is a definite medal prospect. There's some terrific rhythmic chanting going on courtesy of the Chinese fans on the harbour side, but otherwise I'm at a bit of a loss as to what's really going on. In the rowing lake, Greece beat Denmark beat China in the second lightweight sculls semi-final.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>9.17am:</strong> Joe Milton wants boxing; Julian Wilson wants Clare Balding in the weightlifting. That's a dead heat, so I'm sticking with the sailing.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>9.20am:</strong> They've started a 5-minute, 16-boat race in the sailing and deciphering is currently is progress. Meanwhile, the first semi-final of the lightweight fours has just ended in the rowing lake, and Poland won, with Canada and Holland in their slipstream.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>9.22am:</strong> British interests take precedence here, and the men's lightweight fours -- Chambers, Lindsay-Fynn, Mattick and Clarke -- are going in lane two of the rowing lake, against Ireland, Denmark, France, Italy and the USA. Britain are current world champions, so are hotly tipped. And they're off.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>9.26am:</strong> Britain lead. Gary Naylor is in Sweden, and Ranil Dissanayake, who claims to be our most exotically-located reader, being based in Malawi, says \"Boxing! Boxing!\" on the grounds that: \"The skills are all there without any of the queasy liberal guilt of watching the pros maim each other without the protection.\" Hold still, let's get this rowing out the way, and I'll check back on the pugilists.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>9.28am:</strong> Denmark have gone into the lead against Great Britain in the <strong>rowing</strong> after 1,500m. This is only the semi-final, remember, so second is good enough to go through. Ben Ainslie is ahead in his race in the <strong>Finn class sailing</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>9.30am: Great Britain qualify in third place in the men's lightweight fours. </strong>Denmark win the semi-final, France are second, but the World Champions (that'll be the Brits) are through. Ireland were fourth, and have another chance to qualify in some kind of race off.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>9.32am: </strong> Dan Smith has the coveted 9.32am update all to himself: \"Can I be the first to mark Team GB's triumphant Government funded march to 2012? We seem to be working with an illustrious combination of reliable bankers (sailing, rowing, cycling), relatively impressive stasis (white water canoeing, 3-day eventing), individual excellence marred by appalling relay error (swimming), slight improvement unnoticed because it's so far down the field (gymnastics) decline (badminton, archery), marked decline (shooting), predicted continued decline (athletics), irreversible decline/abject embarrassing failure (judo), more abject failure (diving), ridiculous hype coupled with abject embarrassing failure at both individual and organisational level (boxing, see Frankie Gavin) and non-qualification (almost everything else).\"</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>9.34am:</strong> At the third mark in the yngling race, the Dutch team are ahead, with the Brits in third. Ben Ainslie, in the Finn class, is \"doing what he does best\" according to the Beeb's enthusiastic boat-bound commentator, who is kind of angular and looks as though he's peering into the back of a spoon.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>9.40am:</strong> Apologies to Irish rowing fans, your boys are out. They get to race in the B final, but can't qualify for the final, as Joanne Harris, a Brit in New Zealand has just emailed to tell me. If anyone knows the point of the B final, please let me know. Meanwhile, the Slovak brothers Pavol and Peter Hochschorner have won gold in the men's canoe doubles. Having improbably enough spent three months in Slovakia last year, I can tell you those Hochschorners are heroes over there.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>9.44am:</strong> They're preparing for action in the velodrome, the second heat of the men's team sprint. Greece go up against Malaysia. Britain are up in heat six. Wow, that was quick. It's all over in just over 44 seconds, with Malaysia winning it.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>9.50am:</strong> China against Japan in heat six in the velodrome, and it's a disaster for Japan, one of those three riders has a problem with his back wheel and drops out right at the start. A puncture, it seems, as a Chinese Wile E. Coyote is seen creeping out of the arena carrying a box of ACME tacks.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>9.53am:</strong> Thanks again to Joanne Harris for her insight into the rowing. \"And the point of the B final?\" she writes. \"It's about the same as the point of the C and D finals (and E and F, for the singles at these Olympics). It's for FISA (the international rowing federation) placings, so the minor rowing countries know where they've come overall - funding within the countries can depend on it. It's not unimportant, given that 60 nations sent crews to the rowing in Beijing, and occasionally it pays off. Cuba beating Germany is priceless and definitely wouldn't have happened a few years ago.\" Excellent. I genuinely didn't know, so thanks for the info.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>9.56am:</strong> Australia v Russia in the cycling, and the Aussies take it in 44.335seconds, which is the fastest yet. Russia were seventh fastest so far. The Japanese, meanwhile, didn't get a puncture, but one of their riders' chain snapped, so they'll get another chance. Great Britain are up next. (And, Amy from America and Max from Germany, the Germany/Sweden women's handball finished 27-26 in favour of the Swedes.)</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>10am:</strong> Here it is then: Great Britain share the track with Germany in heat six. Britain are represented here by Chris Hoy, Jason Kenny and Jamie Staff. Staff goes like the wind in the first lap, Kenny takes over for the second, leaving Hoy to <strong>BREAK THE WORLD RECORD!!!</strong></p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>10.02am: GREAT BRITAIN BREAK THE WORLD RECORD IN THE HEATS OF THE TEAM SPRINT</strong>. It's a phenomenal achievement from Jamie Staff, Jason Kenny and Chris Hoy. Staff rides the fastest opening lap of any rider ever and Kenny/Hoy keep the pace to finish in 42.950 seconds. Their previous best was 43.777, so that's extraordinary. France and Holland go head to head in heat seven and the French posted the second-fastest time behind that universe best ever cycling feat by three men on two wheels and a bit of fibreglass EVER!</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>10.07am:</strong> Apparently, this cycling track in Beijing, the Laoshan Velodrome, was always expected to be a fast one, and that world record is not as surprising as it seemed to me (and to the cyclists' mothers, who are all in the crowd and chewing on a British flag like it's a comfort blanky.) Again, over to you lot: how and why is one cycling track faster than another?</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>10.11am:</strong> <strong>Ben Ainslie guaranteed at least silver in Finn class sailing</strong> As all our (my) attention was on the velodrome, Ben Ainslie finished second in his latest race in the Finn class sailing and is now guaranteed at least a silver medal. There are two races left and gold is very much in his sights. If only everyone was either on a bike or a boat. Great Britain would rule the world.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>10.15am:</strong> Simon Thomas is asking for trouble, or is at least encouraging me to get into trouble: \"Can you don your fashion critic hat for me and describe the plastic suits worn by our cycling heroes? I can't get to a telly so can't see for myself but I'm hoping they've kind of come over all batman on us.\" Well, there are no capes and there are no pointy ears but otherwise, yes.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>10.20am: </strong>The men's individual pursuit cycling is now underway, and Brett Lancaster of Australia is fastest in the first heat. Steven Burke of the newly-enthused Team GB! GB! GB! goes in the second heat, which is starting .... now!</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>10.25am: </strong> <strong>Steven Burke</strong> trounces his track-mate, the Colombian Alzate, lapping him in fact, and beats his own personal best by nine seconds. <strong>He finishes in 4.22.2, which puts him first from the four who have been out so far</strong>. More wonderful stuff from the British cyclists. Graham Pierce has the skinny on velodromes: \"Beijing is fast mainly because it's new and the surface is clean and blemish free. When velodromes periodically replace the boards speeds always pick up. The angle of banking and tightness of the curves is also a big factor, when the curves are tighter and G forces higher times suffer particularly in the sprint events. This was the case at the world champs in Los Angeles a few years ago. The weather conditions on the day also play a part and generally when it's warmer times are faster. Finally Moscow is known as a really fast track because the aircon system is set up to give the riders a tailwind right the way round the track.\" Is that really true about Moscow? Not that I'm doubting, or anything, but isn't that like installing a huge fan underneath the pole vault run-up, or a motor on the back of a yngling boat?</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>10.29am:</strong> Another gold medal for Slovakia in the white water singles kayak as Elena Kaliska defends her Olympic championship. They're some canoe/kayakers are the Slovaks and they now move ahead of Team GB! GB! GB! in the medals table. They don't have quite the strength in depth in the cycling or sailing, however. So we'll be back.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>10.35am:</strong> A couple more shiny hyper-links for you to click in the standfirst up there, which will take you through to stories about the cycling world record and Ben Ainslie's sailing antics.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>10.40am:</strong> \"Was that really a world record for the cyclists?\" asks Andrew Jolly, who says that the Australian television coverage has not mentioned it at all. Well, everyone is still reporting that it's a world record, although the usually hyperbolic Press Association have included this caveat in their most recent dispatch: \"There is no world record for the event as the team sprint is held over three laps, regardless of the size of the track.\" They still lead the same piece with the line: \"Britain set up a great chance of winning the first gold medal awarded at the Laoshan Velodrome by qualifying for the first round of the team sprint in unofficial record time.\" So, if the track sizes vary, then there can't be any official world record, it seems. But it stands that the British trio have just recorded the fastest time ever in that event, and you can bet your life that if the Aussies had done it, news of a new world record would be all over the surf club and being shaved into Bouncer's soft labrador fur.</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>10.52am: </strong>OK, let's get a grip here. The individual pursuit is underway in the velodrome, with <strong>Bradley Wiggins</strong> up soon. <strong>The British Yngling crew -- Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson -- have now guaranteed at least bronze</strong> in their sailing class, and still have an outside chance of gold. Roger Federer's vanquisher James Blake is into a final set against Fernando Gonzalez in the tennis; Brazil are about to play Norway in the quarter finals of the women's football, and much, much more. </p> <p>There's a lot of AAARRGGHHing coming my way from Alex Pace, who is watching the cycling in Australia. \"AAAARGGGHHHH,\" he aaarghhhs. \"In Australia, they are only showing the Aussie cyclists but even worse hey have put some ignorant Aussie buffoon in the commentary box with the commentating legend that is Phil Liggett, his sole purpose seems to be to interrupt, contradict and irritate the silver-tongued Liggett with observations about how BLOODY GREAT the Australian cyclists are. AAAAARGHHHHH.\"</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>10.59am: </strong>\"An under-ripe banana is as bad for you as a biscuit,\" says the commentator on the tennis. I'm not sure who it is, but she follows up with: \"There's all sorts of banana analysis that's been done.\" Flicking through these internet streams is a lot like listening to snippets of conversations on the tube or something. There's probably some context, but it's usually missed. I'm not sure what Gary Naylor is on about here, either, but it's always good to have him: \"Can anyone confirm if the crowd in Olympic velodrome has adopted the same practices as the crowds in the Belgian Six Day events - specifically, smoking, boozing and eating chips with mayonnaise? Possibly not, I suspect.\" And Roger Cook is thinking of shaving the world record cycling time in to his cats, photographs of which would persuade me to learn how to embed images into this minute-by-minute sports coverage tool to share with the world.</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>11.07am:</strong> <strong>Bradley Wiggins </strong>is on the track in the final heat of the individual pursuit. Steven Burke is still leading, I think, although Wiggins is da man. More on the is-it-isn't-it a world record in the team sprint comes courtesy of Simon Carmouche: \"Most but not all tracks are 250m, so it's not meaningless even though not official.\" Not meaningless, if not official. Is it wrong to adopt that as a life ambition?</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>11.10am:</strong> <strong>Bradley Wiggins eases to the fastest qualifying time in the individual pursuit, and sets a new Olympic record to boot.</strong> The time is 4.15.031. And he'll lead the New Zealander Haydn Rolleston when they reconvene.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>11.13am:</strong> Wiggins was awesome there, and is a clear favourite for gold. Rolleston was second-fastest, then Markov, Dyadnya and then Steven Burke. Steven Gagola, who's pretty sharp on the old email, is angry: \"Your lack of info annoys me. So the British Yngling crew are<br>guaranteed a bronze! Where are they on the current standings and where<br>did they finish today?\" Sorry about that Steven, it did kind of creep up on us. They finished fifth in today's race 8, but still lead the overall standings, which look like this: 1 Gr Britain 22.0 pts, 2 Netherlands 23.0 pts, 3 Greece 42.0 pts, 4 United States 43.0 pts, 5 France 46.0 pts, 6 Russian Feder 46.0 pts, 7 China 47.0 pts, 8 Australia 49.0 pts, 9 Germany 52.0 pts, 10 Norway 57.0 pts, 11 Finland 60.0 pts, 12 S Africa 63.0 pts, 13 Canada 66.0 pts, 14 Spain 67.0 pts, 15 Italy 74.0 pts.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>11.17am:</strong> The team pursuit semi-finals (or second round) are underway. I missed the first one -- these really do fly by -- but I understand that Australia won it, but that Germany recorded a faster time in the second. The British world record holders* are out soon. (*Not an official world record), but first we have Malaysia and France.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>11.22am: </strong>The division of labour here in Guardian Towers is severely imbalanced. The entire media desk behind me are riveted by television coverage of a penguin being knighted at Edinburgh zoo by the Norwegian army. You. Couldn't. Make. It. Up. France won that team sprint against the Malaysians, and the French are quickest so far, from Germany and Australia.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>11.24am:</strong> Team GB! GB! GB!'s (unofficial) World Record holders are on the track. They're up against the United States. Here they go...</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>11.24 and 43.034 seconds am:</strong> Another superlative effort from Staff, Kenny and Hoy who, in that order, have taken the Brits through to the final to face France in the final of the team sprint. The bronze medal ride off will be between Germany and Australia.</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>11.26am: GB through to final in team sprint</strong>. Jamie Staff, Jason Kenny and Chris Hoy will ride for the gold medal against France, a repeat of the World Championship final. Australia and Germany will contest the bronze, which will no doubt please Cameron McCallum, who I suspect is from Down Under: \"Just wondering why you're getting so excited about about a guaranteed bronze,\" says McCallum, mistaking this line \"<strong>The British Yngling crew -- Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson -- have now guaranteed at least bronze</strong>\" for excitement. \"That wouldn't even make the news in Australia. You can have a couple of ours for a while if it makes you feel better.\" Are they yours to give away Cameron?</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>11.34am:</strong> Some talking up, and some dressing down: \"Short of falling off, Brad Wiggins and the team sprinters must have golds in the bag. Or is that hubris?\" says Ga Naylor, obviously friendly enough with Mr Wiggins to drop the \"ley\". For what it's worth, yes it's hubris, but let's hope it's not misplaced. Meanwhile Tim Chadderton and Paul McMillan are right to say I understated the Yngling team's chance of gold. They lead after eight races, so have it all to lose. Which, as it happens, etc., and so forth.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>11.38am: </strong>I can't say I'm all that keen on this, but my inbox is positively groaning from emails from you lot asking me to stick it to the Aussies. \"After tomorrow, we shan't need Cameron McCallum's hand outs, as I believe we will be above the Aussies in the medal table,\" says Richard Alderson, whose comments are fairly representative. Meanwhile the news wires report that Australian cyclists Brad McGee and Brett Lancaster are out of the individual pursuit, the event in which nice and British Bradley Wiggins seems nailed on for gold, and David Hopkins provides a link to an <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,24174888-5012768,00.html\">Australian newspaper story which details a Hong Kong man's attempt to have sex with a park bench</a>. (Warning, link goes to story in an Australian newspaper about a Hong Kong man attempting to have sex with a park bench. With video of the rescue.)</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>11.46am:</strong> Claire Wright speaks for a lot of us here, but has made a mistake in thinking we can clear it up: \"So Bradley Wiggins can set a new Olympic record (11.10am), but (10.02am) the team sprint can't set a new world record. Did Wiggins cycle a set distance rather than number of laps so the length of track (11.07am comment) doesn't matter?\" I really, really don't know. The television coverage definitely flashed up \"Olympic record\" for Wiggins, and also flashed up the same for the team sprint. It didn't, thinking about it now, flash up \"World record\", however. Official/unofficial, Olympic/World. Who cares, huh? GB! GB! GB!</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>11.53am: </strong>Roget Federer's vanquisher James Blake and Fernando Gonzalez are involved in a titanic battle on the tennis court. It's eight games all in the final set (of three) with no tie-break in sight. I actually wrote about this earlier, but those computer gremlins seem to have deleted it. This happens a lot.</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>11.55am: </strong>The velodrome is now hosting the women's 3,000m individual pursuit, in which GB! GB! GB! is represented Wendy Houvenaghel and Rebecca Romero (if the British Olympic team website is correct, which I hope it is). \"In disciplines like the team sprint where the event can be raced over non-standard tracks (thus the distance can vary) the terminology for the British team's achievement is \"world best\",\" asserts John Ogmore, and earns my gratitude. \"On events like the 4000m pursuit the fixed distance allows it to be called a world record no matter which track it is ridden on.\" Thanks to all, who said much the same thing.</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>12pm:</strong> Houvenaghel has started her individual pursuit and is in pursuit of/being pursued by the American cyclist Sarah Hammer. The Brit is a second ahead after 2km.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>12.05pm: Wendy Houvenaghel sets a personal best of 3mins28.443secs in the 3,000m individual pursuit, the fastest time after five heats. </strong>Rebecca Romero is next up, against Katie Mactier, of Australia.</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>12.08pm</strong> Fernando Gonzalez has broken James Blake's serve and is now serving for the match at 10-9 in the final set. Meanwhile Rebecca Romero trounced her Aussie opponent in the individual pursuit and is the second fastest qualifier, behind her team-mate Wendy Houvenaghel. Have some bold text: <strong>Wendy Houvenaghel and Rebecca Romero qualify first and second fastest in the women's 3,000m individual pursuit.</strong></p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>12.11pm:</strong> Are you watching Cameron McCullum? If so, you've just seen your country miss out on third place in the men's team sprint, as Germany edged it on the line to take the bronze medal race. It's the final next, between France and GB! GB! GB!</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>12.15pm: GB! GB! GB! win GOLD in men's team sprint</strong> Terrific stuff from the British cycling team, who set a world best in the heat, cruised through the semi and have now completed the gold medal charge by thrashing the French team, who take silver. Delirious scenes. GB! GB! GB!</p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>12.20pm:</strong> Jamie Staff, Jason Kenny and Chris Hoy will soon be on the podium with a big chunk of gold around their neck. Staff was characteristically exceptional in the first leg, Kenny kept the pace over the second and Hoy anchored it perfectly. Gonzalez beat Blake in the tennis, by the way.</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>12.27pm:</strong> Over to the National Stadium, Beijing, for the heats of the men's 1,500m. Andy Baddeley goes in one of these heats for GB! GB! GB! and has the British commentators all afluster. In the tennis, Gonzalez will play either Novak Djokovic or Rafael Nadal in the final. Their semi takes place later today. \"Is Cameron McCullum's e-mail the most ill-timed piece of jingoistic tub-thumping, or was it simply the dawning realisation that he is fast running out of time to make such a comment?\" asks Robert Hill. Timing, as any comedian will tell you, is 90 percent perspiration.</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>12.30pm:</strong> Tom Lancashire, the British \"hope\" in the second heat of the men's 1,500m finishes out of the qualification places in seventh. A 19-year-old Kenyan, whose name is on the tip of my fingers, wins it.</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>12.37pm:</strong> Andy Baddely leaves it late but looks comfortable in the third heat of the 1,500m to qualify. He sits at the back of the pack for the first couple of laps, which frightens Bredan Foster in the commentary box, but edges forward through the final 600m and comes good on the back straight, where he is forced wide but has the savvy to get into the first few across the line. Five qualify and he's safely through in fourth. \"I..puff...thought...puff...it...puff...was...puff...bang...on,\" says Baddely himself.</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>12.40pm</strong> The heptathletes are back in town and that means Kelly Sotherton. Her first put in the shot put goes 13.87m which is \"solid enough\" according to someone who knows more than me. Just previously, Anna Bogdanova put one 14.04, which is presumably more solid.</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>12.46pm:</strong> \"I've never heard of this \"on the tip of my fingers' guy,\" zings Chris Riley. \"What's his previous form?\" Don't know about other events, but he seems to win a lot when I'm on M-B-M duty. I still can't actually find out the winners of those 1,500m heats, but assume they'll be filtering onto <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics/2008/events/aug/15\">our results page</a> soon-ish.</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>12.53pm:</strong> It's the men's 100m second round now, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/15/olympics2008.olympicsathletics3\">Gay, Powell and Bolt are all comfortably through from the first round.</a> Simeon Williamson, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2008/aug/05/simeon.williamson.olympics.beijing\">previously boasted that he's a medal prospect</a>, is in the first race. And he's out. He finished fourth, with the top three qualifying, who were: Churandy Martina, from Michael Frater and Naoki Tsukahara. Williamson is \"going back to the drawing room\" according to his post-race interview.</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>1pm:</strong> Tyson Gay goes in the second round two race. Metre-by-metre coverage has proven to be just a pipe dream, incidentally. There's a false start before they finally get away and Richard Thompson from Trinidad and Tobago wins it in 9.99, after a slow start. Gay is comfortably through in second, but looked a touch rusty. He'll need to improve.</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>1.03pm: </strong>\"This \"on the tips of my fingers\" implies that you are actually typing this,\" says Simon Martin. \"This is a revelation. I previously pictured you lot sunk into a big armchair in front of a large TV barking dictation to some poor sod on minimum wage.\" That, Simon, is over-by-over cricket coverage you're talking about. \"Toss another typo in the mix, intern. Keep them on their toes.\"</p> <!-- Block 134 --> <p><strong>1.07pm:</strong> Another false start in the third round-two 100m race allows some football updates or, more precisely, a solitary football update. the Brazilian women are through to the final after beating Norway 2-1. Dinara Safina has taken the first set off Jelena Jankovic in the women's tennis semi-final.</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>1.09pm:</strong> <strong>GB! GB! GB!'s Tyrone Edgar finishes third in his second-round heat of the 100m in 10.10 and goes through to tomorrow's semi final.</strong> Marc Burns wins it, Kim Collins is second and they both qualify alongside Edgar.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>1.11pm: </strong>Tempted as I am to fill this MBM with the non-stop barrage of anti-Australian sentiment that is pouring into my inbox, I <em>do</em> want to get served in the bars of Earls Court next time I go there, so I'm going to have to omit most of it. Andrew Jolly, Alex Pace and Chris Bridge, are suffering at the hands of the Australian broadcasters, meanwhile, and have been forced to watch handball and gymnastics repeats instead of the British cycling win. Bridge offers: \"If two slugs were crawling up a wall and one was painted green and gold it would make the news here.\"</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>1.15pm: </strong>That is absolutely extraordinary. Usain Bolt has just <em>jogged</em> to victory in the fourth 100m second-round heat, running 9.92secs without even breaking sweat. \"How much is still in the engine?\" asks the track-side commentator. \"A lot,\" Bolt replies. It really was amazing: he hardly seemed to strain <em>at all</em> and yet won by a mile. Craig Pickering, of GB! GB! GB! finished back in sixth in 10.18 and does not qualify. \"I'm gutted,\" says Pickering. \"Congratulations,\" says the interviewer, inappropriately.</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>1.20pm:</strong> Asafa Powell also ambles into tomorrow's semi-finals, winning his heat in 10.02 but no less comfortably than Bolt. Walter Dix, of the United States, is second and Derrick Atkins third. There are no Brits. Pay attention to John Davis: \"Ease up on the pre-emptive gloating with the Aussies eh? Remember that we are British and that the order of the Universe requires that the wheels fall off (probably literally) our gold medal charge soon.\"</p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>1.26pm:</strong> Replays of the <strong>Usain Bolt</strong> run are now on repeat on the telly, and rightly so. \"What am I supposed to say?\" says Michael Johnson, who is paid to say something in the BBC commentary box. \"We're pretty much guaranteed a world record in the 100 metres,\" he adds. Kelly Sotherton holds onto fifth place in the heptathlon after the shot put, although her best throw was way short of her personal best, and Nataliia Dobrynska broke the record for a heptathlete in that event and leapt up to second in the leaderboard.</p> <!-- Block 140 --> <p><strong>1.32pm: </strong>Turns out -- as many of you have pointed out -- that I understated the extent of the <strong>Yngling</strong> team's achievement earlier. The always-accurate television is confidently declaring that they're set for at least silver and not at least bronze, as previously reported. They're one point ahead of the Holland crew and simply need to finish in front of the Dutch to win.</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>1.35pm:</strong> As the BBC show footage of three tearful British <strong>cyclists</strong> -- Messrs Staff, Kelly and Hoy -- receiving their gold medals for team sprint triumph, news reaches that a French team -- presumably Messrs Porthos, Athos and Aramis -- has won the men's <strong>epee</strong> competition, catapulting France ahead of Britain in the medal table.</p> <p>\"Forget the negativity - talk it up!\" booms Richard Greaves, who actually just wants to tell us that he's going to the Games tomorrow. \"There are plenty more medals to come from our velodrome boys and girls (well there had better be, I'm going tomorrow night and Monday).\"</p> <!-- Block 142 --> <p><strong>1.45pm:</strong> Back to the Bird's Nest stadium, where Helen Clitheroe goes in the heats of the <strong>3,000m steeplechase</strong>, an event making its Olympic debut in Beijing (the women's version, at least). They're not talking up her chances, mind you, with ten of the field having run faster than Clitheroe's personal best.</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>1.49pm</strong> Here's something about the steeplechase I've just learned from Wikipedia (which is the sole reason that A Level pass rates continue to rise, in my opinion. Wikipedia, not the steeplechase): \"The event originated in the British Isles. Runners raced from one town's steeple to the next. The steeples were used as markers due to their visibility over long distances. Along the way runners inevitably had to jump creeks and low stone walls separating estates.\" I like the use of the word \"inevitably\" there, as if there aren't two steeples in the entire land without a couple of creeks and stone walls between them. Clitheroe is going great guns, by the way, and is on course for a British record.</p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>1.52pm</strong> <strong>Helen Clitheroe finishes sixth in the 3,000m steeplechase</strong>. It's probably not good enough to qualify (top four go through, plus a couple of fastest losers from three races), but it's a massive personal best, 10 seconds better than she's ever run before, a British record, and we'll give her a big Team GB! GB! GB! pat on the back for that.</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>1.57pm:</strong> \"Your etymology of steeplechase is interesting, but refers to the horseback version I feel. I know this because of pictures on biscuit tins.\" Nope, Gary Naylor, nope. You and your biscuit tins can <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steeplechase_%28athletics%29\">eat this link</a> which takes you to the athletics disambiguation of steeplechase. In another heat, incidentally, there was a huge pile up over the water jump and I suspect some photographers will have got it. Check out our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2008/aug/11/olympics20081?picture=336621666\">weird Olympic photos gallery</a>, where I expect it to appear overnight.</p> <!-- Block 146 --> <p><strong>2.08pm: </strong>More steeplechase news and it's of the \"agonising\" variety for Team GB and brave Helen Clitheroe in particular. Despite fearing her run wouldn't be good enough, she was given massive hope throughout the final heat when she seemed set to go through as one of the three fastest losers. But at the last minute, an Italian athlete just pipped her and it will be her to who will have to do all that running between the Beijing steeples over creeks and walls again on Sunday. Hard luck Helen.</p> <!-- Block 147 --> <p><strong>2.10pm:</strong> Humliating backtrack here: Gary Naylor was right about the steeplechase. He usually is right. The athletics took its name from the horse race, where the horses were jumping over walls and creeks and not brave athletes named after towns in Lancashire. Sorry Gary. Back to the action, Great Britain are playing South Africa in the hockey and David Davies has made it to the final of the 1,500m freestyle. Grant Hacket, going for his third gold in a row in this event, broke the Olympic record in qualifying fastest.</p> <!-- Block 148 --> <p><strong>2.18pm: </strong>I've had a quick scout around for the latest hockey tables but can't seem to find them, although I remember that Great Britain essentially need to win all their remaining games to have a chance of going through to the medal play-offs. It's 0-0 with 21 minutes left in the first half.</p> <!-- Block 149 --> <p><strong>2.21pm:</strong> Lu Yong wins China's eighth weightlifting gold medal, and the world record to boot. Andrei Rybakou, of Belarus lifted the same weight in the men's 85-kg class, which was a world record, but Lu weighs less and so took the gold.</p> <!-- Block 150 --> <p><strong>2.27pm: </strong>Excellent goal for Great Britain in the hockey, courtesy of James Tindall. A South African player totally missed an attempted interception of a pass in the middle of the pitch and Tindall was clean through on goal. The keeper advanced, but Tindall casually lifted it over him and into the net. Team GB lead 1-0.</p> <!-- Block 151 --> <p><strong>2.36pm:</strong> Quick round-up: Team GB's <strong>Paul Goodison</strong> is joint leader in the men's <strong>laser</strong> (that's sailing, by the way.) He won race four, and the current top three are: 1. Paul Goodison (Britain) 33, 2. Rasmus Myrgren (Sweden) 33, 3. Igor Lisovenko (Russia) 37. <strong>Penny Clark</strong> wasn't quite so good in the women's race and finished 10th in the fourth radial. Japan lead China 1-0 in the first-half of the women's <strong>football</strong> semi-final, where the winners play Brazil. Jelena Jankovic is 4-2 down to Dinara Safina in the <strong>tennis</strong> semi-final. The British women's 100m medley team are into the final, qualifying second fastest behind the Australians, as are the men, who qualified fifth fastest, behind, well, just behind.</p> <!-- Block 152 --> <p><strong>2.38pm: </strong>The 200m is the final event today in the heptathlon, and Kelly Sotherton, lying fifth overall, is in lane three in heat two. She'll be off momentarily.</p> <!-- Block 153 --> <p><strong>2.40pm</strong> Excellent run for Sotherton, who finishes second in her heat in a time of 23.39, which is her personal best. That means 1,040 points, but what that means to the overall standings remains to be seen. Sotherton had a decent day on the track, but blew it in the high jump and shot put. \"I'm gutted,\" said Sotherton, using the buzz word of Team GB! GB! GB! today.</p> <!-- Block 154 --> <p><strong>2.44pm:</strong> Natalia Dobrynska, of Ukraine, wins her heat of the heptathlon 200m and does so wearing a \"leader\" badge, a new innovation here that is kind of like the yellow jersey in the Tour de France. GB's Julie Hollman is back in seventh or eighth. Full standings at the end of the first day to follow.</p> <!-- Block 155 --> <p><strong>2.47pm:</strong> Britain's top discus thrower, Philippa Roles, just misses out on a place in the final. She wangs it 57.44m, but it's not far enough and she ends 16th. The men's shot put final is underway, at the same time as the final heat of the 200m of the heptathlon. After that, we should have the overall standings that will show us where Sotherton is.</p> <!-- Block 156 --> <p><strong>2.53pm:</strong> Dinara Safina has just successfully served for the match against Jelena Jankovic and goes through to the semi-final. Contrary to previous reports, that was the quarter-final and she'll now play China's Li Na in the semi. There are three Russians already in the semis, but Jankovic, the world No1 is out.</p> <!-- Block 157 --> <p><strong>2.54pm:</strong> Tom Bryant is coming in for the coming ten minutes or so, and I'll leave you with news that Kelly Sotherton is up to third in the heptathlon rankings at the end of the first day. Hyleas Fountain leads with 4060, Natalia Dobrynska is second with 3996 and Sotherton third with 3938, but probably won't be happy after a couple of poor events. Anyway, here's Tom.</p> <!-- Block 158 --> <p><strong>3pm:</strong> The men are still doing their thing with their sticks in the hockey and they're still 1-0 up against the South Africans, so jolly good for them. On the track, meanwhile, they're lining up for the men's 400m hurdles heat - which has always struck me as a particularly tricky race to run.</p> <!-- Block 159 --> <p><strong>3.04pm:</strong> The favourite Bershawn Jackson wins it in 49.20 but, even better is the bloke who comes in last. Not sure who he is yet but he came in what must have felt like three days behind the winner. Brilliant stuff, that's what all that training was for. Ah - it was Harouna Garba from Nigeria. See ya!</p> <!-- Block 160 --> <p><strong>3.08pm:</strong> Over in the shot put, it looks like a ZZ Top roadie's convention as a succession of bearded, muscle-bound men compete in what I'd argue is one of the more bizarre track and field events. I can see the point, in an evolutionary sense, of virtually everything else - the javelin was useful for hunting, the running useful for chasing or being chased, the long-jump useful for jumping over things etc. However the point of hurling a large ball as fas as possible? It eludes me. Same for the discus, obviously.</p> <!-- Block 161 --> <p><strong>3.11pm:</strong>Just past halftime in the big women's football semi-final grudge match* between China and Japan, the Japanese are winning 1-0. Currently there are a lot of people lying flat on their backs looking winded. </p> <p><em>* May not actually be a grudge match, reporter groundlessly basing comments on the fact that the two countries are quite close to each other and very little else.</em></p> <!-- Block 162 --> <p><strong>3.13pm:</strong> And with after fact-less reporting, I'll let Howard take back over.</p> <!-- Block 163 --> <p><strong>3.15pm</strong>: \"We are up here TV-less and PC-less, and the New York Times site says Germany has eight golds so far (with no detail), while the Guardian site sticks to 7. Which is right?\" pleads Amy Hordes. Well, last week the NY Times apparently printed a correction from an article written in the mid 1960s, and are the noted arbiters of journalistic accuracy worldwide. I previously not only quoted from Wikipedia, but actually <em>mis</em>applied that baseless \"fact\". You take a guess.</p> <!-- Block 164 --> <p><strong>3.20pm:</strong> Somewhere at the Greatest Show on Earth, Rafael Nadal, arguably the greatest athlete in the world at the moment (Usain Bolt possibly excepted) is playing Novak Djokovic, arguably the greatest Serbian tennis player/impressionist combo in the world. But I can't find any evidence of it on the gogglebox on even the various internet streams, so can't really tell you anything about it. But The Polish ZZ Top roadie has won the shot put, it seems.</p> <!-- Block 165 --> <p><strong>3.24pm:</strong> Roger Cook has the investigative nose of his journalistic namesake: \"If Amy Hordes is TV-less and PC-less, how does she know what the NYT site says (or the Guardian for that matter) and how is she emailing you?\" Good questions, and I'll send the intern to the telex machine straight away to pick up her answer. That Polish shot putter is named Tomasz Majewsky, by the way, and he's taken gold ahead of the American Christian Cantwell.</p> <!-- Block 166 --> <p><strong>3.29pm: </strong>Great Britain have beaten South Africa 2-0 in the men's hockey and stay in with a chance of qualification for the medal matches. It's a fairly big ask - they'll have to beat Australia - but Matt Daley's late goal, added to James Tindall's first-half strike, give them a crucial victory in this match.</p> <!-- Block 167 --> <p><strong>3.32pm: </strong>You leave Tom Bryant in charge of a MBM for ten minutes and he starts a diplomatic incident. Regarding his \"throwaway\" comment that the China-Japan football match might be a grudge match, we have opened up a huge can of military worms: \"Yes, China v Japan most certainly is a grudge match, given added spice by the fact that today is the anniversary of Japan's defeat in WWII,\" explains John Senior. \"The Chinese, as usual, are playing what might be politely described as a robust physical game. Hopefully their fans won't follow suit and pelt the Japanese embassy with eggs and stones, like at the Asian Cup a few years ago.\"</p> <!-- Block 168 --> <p><strong>3.35pm:</strong> The line-up for the semi-finals of the men's 400m hurdles have been decided and there are no members of Team GB! GB! GB! in them, so we can happily pretend the event doesn't exist. \"Yep, grudge match seems fair given Manchuria, Nanking, Japan's continued inability to apologise for war crimes and Chinese support for North Korea and its missile testing in the area,\" intones Anthony O'Keefe.</p> <!-- Block 169 --> <p><strong>3.39pm:</strong> Ker-rash goes my computer. \"I'm watching the tennis live on Malaysian TV in Kuala Lumpur,\" writess Simon Price. \"Nadal has just broken forthree two in the first set.\" Ta.</p> <!-- Block 170 --> <p><strong>3.46pm:</strong> Simon Price's email footer claims he's an executive director of a building communications company in Kuala Lumpur. But today he's moonlighting as a MBM correspondent, watching the tennis: \"Djokovic double faults to go 5:2 down. Nadal serving for the first set. He's killing him.\"</p> <!-- Block 171 --> <p><strong>3.47pm</strong> Meanwhile, John Senior is watching the football, so I don't have to: \"Excellent second goal by Japan. A neat one-two through a crowd on the edge of the box left several Chinese defenders sprawled in a heap as<br>the ball was slotted past the keeper. They'll be boarding up the<br>windows at the Japanese embassy in Beijing about now, I should think.\" A joke too. I never realised how easy this could be. Anyone watching the weightlifting?</p> <!-- Block 172 --> <p><strong>3.48pm:</strong> Joe Milton is concerned for our well-being: \"Are you continuing the MBM over the weekend?\" he asks. \"If so are feeling slightly bitter about it being that hardly anyone will be at work and therefore will be watching on TV or using websites instead of following your commentary?\" Yep, there'll still be full text commentary - in for a penny, etc. But on your second point, you'd be amazed. There are some folk who read this <em>while</em> they're also watching it on TV. Lord knows why, but it's true. Anyway, the women's 10,000m final is underway in the Bird's Nest.</p> <!-- Block 173 --> <p><strong>3.52pm: </strong>And finally the tennis appears on my screen, so Simon Price, you can now go to bed if you want to. Djokovic broke back against Nadal, but the Spaniard is still serving for the set at 5-4.</p> <!-- Block 174 --> <p><strong>3.55pm</strong> This straight from the news-wires: Women's doubles Final: 1 DU Jing &amp; Wei Yili &amp; Yang Wei &amp; Yu Yang &amp; Zhang Jiewen &amp; Zhang Yawen (Chn), 2 Jungeun Ha &amp; Minjung Kim &amp; Hyojung Lee &amp; Kyungwon Lee (Kor), 3 DU Jing &amp; Wei Yili &amp; Yang Wei &amp; Yu Yang &amp; Zhang Jiewen &amp; Zhang Yawen (Chn), 4 Miyuki Maeda &amp; Kumiko Ogura &amp; Reiko Shiota &amp; Satoko Suetsuna (Jpn), Tania Luiz &amp; Eugenia Tanaka (Aus), DU Jing &amp; Wei Yili &amp; Yang Wei &amp; Yu Yang &amp; Zhang Jiewen &amp; Zhang Yawen (Chn), Wen-Hsing Cheng &amp; Yu-Chin Chien (Tpe), Kamilla Rytter Juhl &amp; Lena Frier Kristiansen (Den), Gail Emms &amp; Donna Kellogg (Gbr), Liliyana &amp; Vita Marissa (Ina), Miyuki Maeda &amp; Kumiko Ogura &amp; Reiko Shiota &amp; Satoko Suetsuna (Jpn), Jungeun Ha &amp; Minjung Kim &amp; Hyojung Lee &amp; Kyungwon Lee (Kor), Eei Hui Chin &amp; Pei Tty Wong (Mal), Chantal Botts &amp; Michelle Edwards (Rsa), Yanmei Jiang &amp; Yujia Li (Sin), Eva Lee &amp; Mesinee Mangkalakiri (USA)</p> <!-- Block 175 --> <p><strong>3.56pm</strong> Nadal wins the first set 6-4. That garbled stuff below was my attempt to find out who won the women's doubles badminton, and I think this says it better: DU &amp; Yu (Chn) bt Lee &amp; Lee (Kor) 2-0; (21-15), (21-13) , so that's another gold for the home nation.</p> <!-- Block 176 --> <p><strong>3.59pm:</strong> \"There's a 'Racket of God' controversy brewing in the tennis,\" says Kevin Davies, and he's right, although he's maybe overstating it. \"Near the end of the Blake-Gonzalez match, NBC showed Blake losing a critical point after his shot fell out. It clearly grazed Gonzalez' racket, but the Chilean didn't acknowledge the touch. Blake tried showing restraint but bemoaned lack of Olympic spirit in the press conference.\" The TV commentators are on about this as well at the moment. Apparently Gonzalez should have called the foul on himself, but didn't, and Blake didn't win another game after the incident. This should give the noted moodster Blake something to whinge about for the coming few months.</p> <!-- Block 177 --> <p><strong>4.02pm:</strong> They're 14 minutes into the women's 10,000m, and GB's Jo Pavey is in about 16th place and \"running very wisely\" according to Brendon Foster. Holland's Lornah Kiplagat is out front.</p> <!-- Block 178 --> <p><strong>4.09pm:</strong> Kiplagat still leads with 11 laps to go, with Mestawet Tufa, of Ethiopia, second. Jo Pavey is beginning to struggle, especially compared with the casualness of the leaders. Pavey is out of the leading group now and is going to find it hard to get back into this.</p> <!-- Block 179 --> <p><strong>4.12pm: </strong>Elvan Abeylegesse, of Turkey, is the new, mightily inconvenient leader for anyone typing this up. Tirunesh Dibaba, from Ethiopia, is second and Britain's Jo Pavey has fallen off the back of the earth.</p> <!-- Block 180 --> <p><strong>4.16pm:</strong> Abeylegesse still leads a strung-out group five, from Dibaba. Dibaba remains an Ethiopian, the nation that Abeylegasse left for Turkey. And it's definitely just between these two now as they move well clear of the rest of the field. Jo Pavey has now slipped off of even Brendan Foster's radar.</p> <!-- Block 181 --> <p><strong>4.20pm: </strong>Novak Djokovic has broken Nadal in the second set of the men's semi-finals and leads 3-1. Abeylgesse and Dibaba are still going this alone, with both looking totally at ease, but Dibaba sitting threateningly on Abeylgesse's shoulder. Shalane Flanagan has moved into third spot for the United States.</p> <!-- Block 182 --> <p><strong>4.22pm:</strong> <em>That's</em> how you win a <strong>10,000m </strong>race. At the bell, <strong>Tirunesh Dibaba</strong> explodes past Abeylgesse and flies into the lead. She sprints for the final 400m at a phenomenal rate and no one can get close. Abeylgesse keeps second and Flanagan takes third for the United States. \"That's not the result she would have wanted,\" says Steve Cram in the commentary box, as Jo Pavey comes in 412th from a field of 32. Dibaba's time was 29:54.68, which is one of the fastest times ever, despite smog, heat, etc., and so forth.</p> <!-- Block 183 --> <p><strong>4.26pm:</strong> Novak Djokovic leads 4-1 in the second set, but is one set down to Rafael Nadal. I'm busily trying to find someone to take over this to see you to the end of the tennis.</p> <!-- Block 184 --> <p><strong>4.28pm:</strong> With a repeated punch to his own chest, Novak Djokovic breaks Nadal again to lead 5-1 in the second set. Looks like this one's going to a decider. Meanwhile, Jo Pavey asks \"What can you do?\" in her post-race interview and Kate Reed, whose was running in her first ever 10,000m final and didn't even appear in the commentary until it was done, also has a brief, sweaty chat. Not the results the British athletes will have been looking for, but a decent race nonetheless.</p> <!-- Block 185 --> <p><strong>4.33pm: </strong>OK, Pavey actually finished in 12th spot and Kate Reed 23rd. Djokovic levels the tennis and that goes to a decider, while Caroline Kluft doesn't qualify for the triple jump final. That's it from me. I'm off, but a full report from the tennis will follow. Full coverage continues over the weekend. Thanks for your emails. Bye.</p>"
