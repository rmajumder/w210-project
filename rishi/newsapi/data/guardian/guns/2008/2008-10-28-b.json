  "<p>There's something rotten in the state of Kentucky, and I'm not talking about the fried chicken. It is \u2014 and has been \u2014 the antics and voting record of the Bluegrass State's senior senator, Minority Leader <a href=\"http://mcconnell.senate.gov/\">Mitch McConnell</a>, over his 24-year career in Washington. And in what I would label the second most important race in the upcoming US election, a businessman named <a href=\"http://www.bruce2008.com/\">Bruce Lunsford</a> may <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1853514,00.html\">replace</a> the most powerful Republican in either body of Congress.<br> McConnell, a grandfatherly figure with the charisma of your average door knob and the conscience of a conservative, has never been an overly popular figure in Kentucky. In fact, in every election save his most recent on in 2002, when running against a mediocre opponent while the drums of war were beating in post-9/11 America, McConnell has been unable to clear 55% of the vote. Yet, what he lacks in social skills he makes up for in hard work and sheer shamelessness. McConnell has long been an appendage of the corporate lobby, <a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/senate/mitch_mcconnell.htm\">voting</a> with President Bush 95% of the time and making a career out of doing what's best for your average, economically strapped Fortune 500 CEO \u2014 including bottling up any and all attempts to limit the amount of money flowing through the US political system. His mastery of Senate procedure has served him well, as he has been able to increase his clout and the power of his party through parliamentary maneuvers (recently breaking a record for blocked legislation in the process), while raising enough corporate cash for his campaigns to find a cure for cancer.<br> When this did not suffice, he has always been willing \u2014 much like Karl Rove and his favourite political project George Bush \u2014 to parachute down to the lowest common denominator, whipping up those he routinely hurts through his votes on economic issues by pandering to whatever social phobia he can think to conjure up. It has been abortion here, gays there and terrorism all around. In a state that has the sixth highest share of Christian evangelical voters in the country and a largely white populace, this has often been enough. But suddenly, with Republicans around the country <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/27/us/politics/27campaign.html?ref=politics\">reeling from their association</a> with Bushenomics, an unpopular war in Mesopotamia and a cupboard full of scandal, McConnell has fallen victim to a combination of this sweeping tide and a very able and resource-rich opponent in Mr. Lunsford.<br> Now that public and private polling show this <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/polls/ky/08-ky-sen-ge-mvl.php\">race to be close</a>, the campaign arm of the Senate Democrats, the <a href=\"http://www.dscc.org/home\">Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee</a>, has jumped into the race with funding for ads hitting McConnell's rancid record. Even a prominent Republican in Kentucky (a recent candidate for governor of the state) has thrown his support behind Lunsford. Add in an <a href=\"http://www.kentucky.com/591/story/568978.html\">endorsement from the state's largest newspaper</a>, the Louisville Courier-Journal, and recent <a href=\"http://media.www.wkuherald.com/media/storage/paper603/news/2008/10/28/News/Clinton.Rallies.For.Lunsford.In.Bg.Airport.Hanger-3509508.shtml\">campaign visits</a> by former President Clinton and senator Hillary Clinton, and you have what is known as \"Big Mo\" working for Lunsford, which must be inducing heartburn at Camp McConnell.<br> Lunsford's charm and common sense policy positions make him an even safer bet for an upset. When I recently interviewed him, he told me he supports the redeployment of US troops from Iraq and universal access to health care, while strongly opposing tax breaks for oil companies and the partial privatisation of social security. These issues all place him on the right side of public opinion, while McConnell is left to try and divert people's attention from his failed agenda with attack ads and shiny objects. Lunsford is also in favour of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/16/usa.food?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=worldnews\">\"Country of Origin\"</a> labeling, an economically populist position and important stand in Kentucky that puts small American farmers before agribusiness conglomerates \u2013 or McConnell's base, if you will.</p> <p>There is no doubt that Lunsford is still the underdog. Especially with McCain all but certain to handily carry this southern border state in the presidential election. But Lunsford is right in this thing, and he has a serious chance at being Kentucky's next senator. Besides an Obama victory, that would be the biggest victory for progressives, Kentuckians and all Americans on November 4.</p>",
  "<p>Has this election made America smarter? If talk shows and gab-fests say anything about where American society is, consider what the ABC morning girl-talk chat show says about this election, and by extension, the country. <a href=\"http://abc.go.com/daytime/theview/cohosts\">The View</a> \u2013 starring news legend Barbara Walters, comedians Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar and Sherri Shepard and former reality television star Elisabeth Hasselbeck \u2013 has been on the air for 11 years now, with its share of controversy amid its typical daytime fare of gushing interviews with starlets and chats with authors. Indeed, The View has always been known for dipping into the issues of the moment - Barbara Walters makes sure of it. So did former cast member Rosie O'Donnell who <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xht0HcPryWA\">would get into it</a> with the conservatives until she left the show last year. <br> What's striking to me about the programme now is how this election has suddenly created political shorthand that is accessible to everyone \u2013 not just those who wait until the evening to watch <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036697/\">Hardball</a>, or are addicted to <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036677/\">Keith Olbermann</a> or <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26315908/\">Rachel Maddow</a> (guilty!) \u2013 in other words the MSNBC liberals or Fox News diehards. <br> Take a recent exchange on The View, in an argument about Obama and Bill Ayers where Ms Hasselbeck, the former Survivor and only true Republican on the show, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3iCWMsF32w\">returned to insisting</a> \u2013 Sarah Palin style \u2013 that Americans needed to know the truth about the relationship between Ayers and Obama \u2013 days after Obama had succinctly made his statements about Ayers in his final debate with McCain and pretty much everyone else had weighed in on the ridiculous idea of hanging Obama with the long-ago deeds of Ayers. (This wasn't the first time Hasselbeck <a href=\"http://www.mollygood.com/hasselbeck-this-is-not-about-smearing-20081006\">clung to the McCain line</a> on this smear; nor was it the most aggressive.) Walters tried to talk Hasselbeck down, pushing away the idea of guilt by association bringing up McCain's ability to avoid taint-by-association to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keating_Five\">Keating Five</a> scandal. To which Hasselbeck cut her off and forcefully maintained that one had nothing to do with the other because McCain was \"acquitted\" of all wrongdoing in the scandal.</p> <p>Sure, Elisabeth's point was infuriating. But since when is the average daytime television watcher on familiar with corruption scandals of the 1980s? <br> And since when has there been such a crossover into politics themselves? The audience must be used to the strange hybrid this show has become \u2013 and the weird access these women have to penetrating questions and real discussion that somehow much of the rest of television news has lost.  Back in September, when John McCain <a href=\"http://www.popcrunch.com/john-mccain-cindy-mccain-the-view-video-september-12/\">came on the show </a>expecting some tea and sympathy, he was called a \"liar\" and asked to explain his positions on the separation between church and state, Roe versus Wade and announcing \"I approved this message,\" when the message was clearly an exaggeration. (In response, Sunday New York Times columnist <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/frankrich/index.html\">Frank Rich</a> called Joy Behar, a New York accented hard-talking comedian, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/opinion/21rich.html\">\"The New Edward R Murrow\"</a>) When the Sarah Palin clothing story broke, Joy Behar was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/23/us/politics/23palin.html?_r=1&amp;hp=&amp;oref=slogin\">quoted</a> in the New York Times coverage of the Neiman Marcus/Saks shopping spree fiasco, saying in language all viewers could relate to: \"I don't think Joe the Plumber wears Manolo Blahniks\". All the women noted Palin has not come on the show since her nomination, but the hosts also chided Biden and Obama for not returning to the show. Obama appeared during the primaries and Michelle Obama largely <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedishrag/2008/06/what-do-us-wome.html\">won over the audience</a> when she appeared this summer.<br> Some of this crossover into political advocacy treads a bit dangerously. This past weekend Elisabeth Hassselbeck, who was brought on the show in 2003 and is cheerfully anti-abortion and pro-McCain-Palin - spent the weekend <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedishrag/2008/10/elisabeth-has-1.html\">stumping</a> in Florida with Sarah Palin. She mocked the Obama campaign and advanced some of the same half-truths and weird elisions the campaign itself supports. When the women of The View fact check each other and smack down some of their wilder allegations, the show's increasingly political bent feels like a healthy mid-morning snack. But listening to Hasselbeck's smirking, preening and unadulterated posturing for Sarah Palin was embarrassing at best and mendacious at worst. But then there are rumors she wants a show on Fox. In which case <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYQN4vBjLUU&amp;feature=related\">the audition</a> went very well.</p>",
  "<p>Combing through the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/24/us-elections-virginia-roanoke\">cities and towns of Virginia</a> with Barack Obama's campaign these days, you'd be surprised at how little you hear the word \"hope\". The big picture vision, embodied in the emotive, high-flying rhetoric of the primary season, has officially landed. In its place is a much more brass-tacks approach that, judging by <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/va/virginia_mccain_vs_obama-551.html\">recent polls</a>, is paying handsome dividends.</p> <p>Virginia has voted to put a Republican in the White House in every election since 1964. So on the surface, the fact that a Democrat holds even the slimmest hopes of winning is newsworthy. But this isn't some freakish or sudden occurrence. It instead represents the confluence of several factors \u2013 some recently created by Obama's campaign, and others that have been brewing for years.</p> <p>Most importantly, Obama has built a serious ground game here. Democrats have often whined about (and not so secretly envied) the black arts of Karl Rove's invincible machine. And while nationally and state-wide the campaign has done much to match, if not exceed these efforts, they've also tailored their approach in a way highlights Virginia's unique political personality. This means being strong on the ground and not just the airwaves, a near religious dedication to all things local and an emphasis on policies as opposed to political affiliation.</p> <p>The Obama campaign's bulging wallet has allowed it to open <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601070&amp;sid=asgE3Ehgqfh4&amp;refer=politics\">69 offices in the state compared to John McCain's 20</a>. Yet the campaign is not wielding this numerical advantage like a blunt instrument. They're wielding it like a scalpel. Armed with <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081011/ap_on_el_pr/campaign_ground_game\">scanned spreadsheets and tailored talking points</a>, they've been ruthlessly efficient. Volunteers and staff are easily able to filter out those certain to vote for McCain versus those that are independent, or wavering in their support of either candidate. Talking to a smattering of self-described hardcore Republicans here, not a single one had received so much as a flyer from Obama. This filter means volunteers don't spend time knocking on thousands of doors, calling thousands of households and wasting thousands of hours on voters that bleed Republican red.<br> They have also been heavily focused on localising efforts. This contrasts with the big, and to some eyes impersonal rallies that defined the primary season. In 2004 much of the Democratic ground game here consisted of cobbled together teams from disparate groups, such as 527s and unions. This made delivering a coherent, localised message difficult. This year, however, the ground game is obsessive in their efforts to remain consistent and local, referring to themselves as \"neighbourhood volunteers\" and often mentioning where they live in relation to their targets. This leavens a political hard sell with southern hospitality, which does wonders south of the Mason Dixon. Obama, with a background seemingly so dissimilar from many ordinary Virginians, benefits greatly by these local volunteers saying in essence: \"It's alright - I'm like you and he's OK!\"</p> <p>All of this effort from the ground game has helped Obama build a slight-to-sizeable lead according to various polls. The news media has excitedly reported this as genuinely surprising. Virginians are less disbelieving. \"Republicans don't have a slam dunk here at all,\" says Rebecca Snyder, owner of a wine bar in Fredericksburg. \"The demographic makeup is changing and with that come different ideas about politics.\" In addition to his ground game and these demographic changes (driven by an influx of urbanites), Obama is benefiting from the fact that this state has always thought of itself as independent minded.</p> <p>Given its recent electoral history, it might be fair to say that Virginia is more issues-oriented than party-oriented. While being a stalwart red state in presidential races, its last two governors have been Democrats, and one of them, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/13/barackobama.uselections2008\">Mark Warner</a>, is likely to soon represent Virginia in the US Senate as well. \"There's just not a guarantee that a guy can come here and win on partisan affiliations,\" Snyder added.</p> <p>In Virginia, your position on an issue like a car tax is just as likely to secure a vote as your winning personality or the parenthetical letter to the right of your name. And with the markets fluctuating wildly and dire economic news plentiful, Virginians are likely to mine specific kitchen-table policy stances more than ever before. That is not exactly where McCain wants things to be.</p> <p>Even the most sceptical observer would admit that Obama has the votes to win Virginia. But will they show up? If Obama supporters do not make the effort next week, there will be nothing for Virginia Democrats to celebrate. But the ground army is now plainly aware that \"hope\" will not materialise votes on November 4. A dogged and tactical plan will. The rhetoric seems to have landed, and with it hopes of a victory have soared.</p>",
  "<p>On election day 2004, <a href=\"http://blogs.cqpolitics.com/davidcorn/\">David Corn</a> and I spent part of the afternoon at a Starbucks near Boston's Copley Square, a couple of blocks from where John Kerry would hold his party that night.</p> <p>For a few brief hours, a Kerry victory looked certain. We wondered whom Kerry might choose to fill his cabinet. And Corn lamented his decision to come to Boston rather than stay in Washington for George W. Bush's bash. Losers, he explained, are always more interesting.</p> <p>So if you are a supporter of Barack Obama, you will have to forgive me today for spraying you with a blast of ice water.</p> <p>Listen to me: Obama might lose.</p> <p>As we head into the final days of the campaign - or the end times, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2203120/\">as Sarah Palin might put it</a> - let me count the ways by which McCain could pull this off.</p> <p>1. Voter suppression. What do you think the McCain campaign's full-scale war against <a href=\"http://www.acorn.org/\">Acorn</a> is all about? Acorn, a left-leaning activist organisation, has indeed engaged in voter registration fraud - or, rather, has had registration fraud perpetrated upon it by unscrupulous signature gatherers. But these phony voters are <a href=\"http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/223436.php\">not going to be able to cast ballots</a> unless they show up at the polls with some sort of valid identification.</p> <p>No matter. The Acorn storyline gives the Republicans cover to stop legitimate voters from exercising their right to vote. That's what happened to Al Gore in 2000, when thousands of predominantly African American voters in Florida were <a href=\"http://archive.salon.com/politics/feature/2000/12/04/voter_file/print.html\">wrongly classified as felons</a> who couldn't vote in that state. And it happened again in Ohio in 2004, where <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10432334/was_the_2004_election_stolen\">Republicans suppressed</a> as many as 350,000 votes.</p> <p>\"The real threat here is the Republican party using attacks on Acorn as a calculated strategy to justify massive challenges to the votes cast in Democratic-leaning voting precincts on election day,\" <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/27/brazile.acorn/index.html\">writes Donna Brazile</a>, Al Gore's 2000 campaign manager.</p> <p>Indeed. Already, the Republicans are <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/24/AR2008102403659.html\">challenging the eligibility</a> of some 200,000 newly registered Ohio voters. And in Florida, the voting machines are as <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96183505\">screwed up</a> as they've ever been. Acorn itself reports that <a href=\"http://www.acorn.org/index.php?id=12439&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=22412&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=12387&amp;cHash=9aef6579ec\">voter suppression efforts</a> are under way in New Mexico and Michigan.</p> <p>This is the stuff of which liberal nightmares are made. It's unbelievable that it's still going on - or it would be unbelievable until you remember that it benefits the Republicans, who used these tactics to control the presidency for the past eight years.</p> <p>2. The Bradley effect. Nobody knows, it's a different country from 1982, when <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/13/obama.bradley.effect/\">Tom Bradley lost</a> the California governor's race, Obama might benefit from a <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1008/A_reverse_Bradley_Effect.html\">reverse Bradley effect</a>, blah blah blah.</p> <p>The fact is, it's possible there are substantial numbers of white voters who won't support a black candidate, but won't tell pollsters that. It won't show up in the exit polls either, because they'll lie to them, too. And voter suppression efforts will serve to hide the whole ugly phenomenon.</p> <p>Granted, there is one strong piece of evidence that the Bradley effect is not in play. The same white voters who say they'll vote for Obama are also saying they'll vote in favour of Democratic Senate and House candidates, some in states that haven't chosen a Democrat in practically forever, like <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20081026/ts_alt_afp/usvotecongress_081026193028\">North Carolina and Kentucky</a>.</p> <p>But might these voters decide, in the end, to choose an overwhelmingly Democratic Congress kept in check by a Republican - and reassuringly white - president? Yes, they might. We just don't know.</p> <p>3. Fear and smear. John McCain and Sarah Palin have thrown everything they can find at Obama, accusing him of <a href=\"http://www.kansascity.com/445/story/847810.html\">hanging out with terrorists</a>, of wanting to turn the Internal Revenue Service <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081025/ap_on_bi_ge/sharing_the_wealth_1\">into a \"welfare\" agency</a> (a convenient opportunity to link a black man to the \"w\" word) and, most recently, of being a <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20081027/pl_afp/usvotemccainrights_081027191640\">\"socialist\"</a> who just doesn't understand the life and times of St. Joseph the Plumber.</p> <p>The latest attack arose on Monday of this week, when <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2008/10/mccain_slams_ob_3.html\">an old radio interview</a> surfaced on the <a href=\"http://www.drudgereport.com/\">Drudge Report</a> in which Obama said he favoured the \"redistribution of wealth\". The right, predictably, went nuts, though it proves nothing except that <a href=\"http://www.kentucky.com/329/story/568962.html\">Obama supports</a> the 16th amendment to the constitution, approved in 1913. Presumably McCain does, too.</p> <p>In the end, though, this stuff always works, or at least it always has. Obama's ability to remain calm and in control is admirable. But John Kerry remained calm and in control <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/article231.html\">while he was being swift-boated</a>, didn't he?</p> <p>Do I really think McCain can pull this off? No. If I were forced to bet, I'd bet on an Obama victory. He's been <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/10/todays-polls-1027.html\">too far ahead</a> for too long. This has all the appearance of a race in which people have made up their minds and won't be moved.</p> <p>Still, if McCain wins, I'll only be mildly surprised. We've all lived through this too many times before.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama demonstrated his pulling power by attracting thousands of people to an outdoor rally in torrential rain today in Pennsylvania, a state on which John McCain has staked almost all of his hopes of a surprise win next Tuesday's election.</p> <p>Confirming Pennsylvania's pivotal position on the electoral map, McCain was also in the state, campaigning alongside his running-mate, Sarah Palin, who told a crowd of about 10,000: \"It is going to come down to the wire here.\"</p> <p>Although it was one of McCain's best performances in weeks, he is facing polls that put Obama consistently ahead - the latest has Obama on 51% to McCain on 41%.</p> <p>He is also beset by continuing distractions over Palin. Amid persistent rumours of strains between his campaign team and her advisers, the Politico website quoted one of his aides, speaking anonymously, describing her as \"a whack job\".</p> <p>With time running out for McCain, Obama today showed how difficult it will be for the Republican candidate to make up ground in the state.</p> <p>In spite of ankle-deep mud and freezing rain, campaign workers estimated about 8,000 people waited for hours for him to arrive in Chester, on the outskirts of Philadelphia, huddled under umbrellas, draped in plastic ponchos and even wearing plastic carrier bags over their shoes.</p> <p>\"This is an unbelievable crowd for this kind of weather,\" Obama told them when he stepped out in a dark rain jacket over jeans. \"If we see this kind of dedication on election day there is no way we are not going to bring change to America.\"</p> <p>Pennsylvania, which has voted for Democrats in every presidential election since 1988, is the only Democratic state where McCain is still strongly competing.</p> <p>In spite of a commanding lead over McCain in the polls, Obama's main ally in the state, the governor, Ed Rendell, has been warning the campaign not to take Pennsylvania for granted. Although Obama is ahead overall, detailed polls show the several key counties have tightened in McCain's favour over the last week and the two are now in a dead heat.</p> <p>McCain is also pinning his hopes on white, working-class voters reluctant to turn out for Obama for a variety of reasons, including race. But many of them are angry over the economy and the blame they attribute to the Republicans outweighs their own lingering prejudices.</p> <p>McCain's rally was indoors, at the Giant Arena, in Hershey, the central Pennsylvania home of the chocolate bar, and, after days of only attracting derisory crowds, he almost filled the 12,000-seat ice hockey stadium.</p> <p>McCain appeared to be reinvigorated and, after weeks of floundering, to have settled on a consistent message portraying Obama as a socialist and untested in a crisis.</p> <p>Seeming to address the reports of tension between his and Palin's teams, McCain, standing only a few feet from her, said: \"When two mavericks join up we don't agree on everything, but it's a lot of fun.\"</p> <p>Areas like Hershey are where the election could be won or lost, with residents saying the town is fairly evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats.</p> <p>To loud cheers from a boisterous crows, McCain said: \"We are going to fool the pundits and win Pennsylvania.\"</p> <p>McCain took a swipe at Obama over the million dollars he is spending on a half-hour paid-for television address tomorrow night, unprecedented in US political history. It will held before a World Series baseball game, delaying the start, to the irritation of some fans.</p> <p>\"By the way, no one will interrupt the World Series for an infomercial when I'm president,\" McCain said.</p> <p>In spite of a standing ovation, many in the audience had come to see not McCain but Palin, who received the loudest cheers. Some of the audience left after she has spoken and before McCain had a chance to begin.</p> <p>In spite of Obama's turn-out today, there is a lot of resistance to him in places like Hershey. Kim Condran, 40, a health worker who was at the McCain rally, expressed confidence that McCain can still take Pennsylvania. \"Obama is not a truthful person. I don't think he is revealing everything in his past. He has too many connections to foreigners, the bad ones,\" she said.</p> <p>McCain and Palin had a good turn-out given the event was early in the morning, that it was a working day and the rain was heavy. But McCain opted against putting to the test whether he is capable of drawing, like Obama, an outdoor crowd in heavy rain, cancelling such an event later in the day in Quakertown, Pennsylvania.</p> <p>Pennsylvania's two major cities, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh are expected to vote heavily for Obama, while McCain hopes to wrap up the small towns and rural areas sandwiched between them.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, the Obama camp is worried about long lines at polling stations and other disruptions in battleground states.</p> <p>Voting rights advocates in Pennsylvania have filed law suits to demand that state election officials increase their supply of paper ballots, and have reserves of trained poll workers on hand.</p>",
  "<p>Now that the financial markets have imploded and the New Labour/Tory mantra of \"public sector bad, private sector good\" has been well and truly flattened, attitudes have predictably polarised. The nationalisers think they're back in fashion, and that full-scale nationalisation is the answer to whatever the question is, as though public ownership by itself alone offered a solution to everything. The private marketers think once the current glitch is over, it's back to business as usual.</p> <p>Both these extreme responses are absurd. But the current breakdown does prompt a serious re-think of what new model is now needed \u2013 not an ideological ultimatum, but a hard-headed look at where the balance between the public and private sectors should now be drawn so as best to redress the problems that have been exposed. </p> <p>The problems in banking have been revealed to be a flocking into worthless financial derivatives (because they were thought to offer super-profits), a readiness for speculative trading rather than lending to businesses and individuals, a growing shift to offshore operations to reduce transparency and tax, and a resort to massive bonuses which promoted recklessness rather than innovation and dynamism in banks' proper functions. </p> <p>They also extensively promoted mortgage lending to a huge number of low-income households who could obviously never afford it \u2013 the UK's very own sub-prime market scandal. There is clearly a very strong case for at least one publicly-owned bank as an exemplar to transform the whole ethos of banking practices which have now become seriously corrupted, quite likely beyond the reach even of tighter regulation.</p> <p>Moreover, when the government (or at least Mandelson) is thinking of part-privatisation of the Post Office, there is also a strong case for pursuing the opposite course of re-establishing a new <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Giro\">Girobank</a> and bolstering the Post Office Card Account within the Royal Mail. The former would provide universal access to banking which the private sector never will. Britain has only 180 bank branches per million inhabitants, against triple that number in France, Germany and Italy and five times that number in Spain. </p> <p>The fashion for outsourcing transport contracts to the private sector also needs to be reviewed. Several rail accidents (including the Clapham train disaster) have been traced back to faulty work passed down the line to over-stressed contractors forced to work too long or to loss of managerial control through myriad sub-contracting. Notorious losses of highly sensitive IT data (including two CDs containing a mass of personalised data about half the entire population) as well as large passport batches have been due to private couriers. Bringing this work back under more secure public sector procedures could save substantial costs as well as political embarrassment.</p> <p>In pharmaceuticals the need for a public sector comparator becomes clearer all the time. The recent dispute about whether people who buy very expensive drugs privately should then have to pay for the rest of their NHS treatment misses the key point, as the chairman of <a href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/\">Nice</a> pointed out, that many drugs are far too costly. Regulation will never get close enough to the inner workings of pharmaceutical companies to be an effective constraint on excess profiteering. One or two publicly-owned drugs companies could make huge savings for the NHS.</p> <p>The government's prejudice against council housing (even in Thatcher's last year 13,000 council houses were built, compared to only 100 a couple of years ago) has crucified hundreds of thousands on ballooning council waiting lists which have now reached 1.7 million in addition to nearly 100,000 homeless. The private sector, whether through home ownership or renting, will never get anywhere near providing decent housing for the poorest quarter of the population.

  "<p>Last year Microsoft was promising great advances in the way we use our computers thanks to Vista, a new version of its Windows system. Just 18 months later, however \u2013 and after a year of intense criticism \u2013 the company today unveiled its successor, Windows 7.</p> <p>The new system, which is unlikely to go on sale for at least another year, attempts to fix a number of problems with Vista and allow Microsoft to compete with a new generation of internet-based systems that are beginning to challenge its worldwide dominance.</p> <p>Showing off Windows 7 for the first time at the company's Professional Developers' Conference in Los Angeles, chief software architect Ray Ozzie unveiled a vision of the future that included not only your desktop PC, but also your mobile phone and the online world.</p> <p>\"We are bringing the best of the web to Windows, and the best of Windows to the web,\" said Ozzie, who took over the company's strategy from co-founder Bill Gates. </p> <p>\"From PC to the web to the phone, we are focused on enabling the creation of the next generation of user experiences that change the way we live, work and play.\"</p> <p>At first glance, Windows 7 appears similar to Vista, but Microsoft is promising a number of improvements in performance. </p> <p>The system will be faster and easier to use, Ozzie said, and is set to include hi-tech additions such as improved user interface, a new taskbar and support for a new generation of multitouch screens.</p> <p>The company announced new features to help protect privacy and manage your computer's health.</p> <p>Ozzie also demonstrated a new version of Microsoft Office which uses the internet to store files \u2013 allowing users to pick up their documents from any computer that is online.</p> <p>Developers at PDC 2008 are being offered a pre-beta build of Windows 7, as well as early copies of some of Microsoft's other products being launched at the conference \u2013 such as the new cloud computing system, Azure.</p> <p>The announcement marks the latest attempt by Microsoft to put the disappointing launch of Windows Vista behind it.</p> <p>\"We've done a lot of work around how you manage the windows, how you launch programs and how you manage the windows of the programs you've launched,\" said Steven Sinofsky, the senior vice-president for Windows. \"It's all about personalisation and putting you in control of the PC.\"</p>",
  "<p>The former <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenhamhotspur\" title=\"\">Tottenham</a> manager Juande Ramos has blamed the sale of strikers Dimitar Berbatov and Robbie Keane for the poor form that led to his sacking.</p> <p>\"The departures of Robbie Keane and Berbatov, important players in the team for their technical and human qualities and their scoring abilities, was too hard a blow for the squad,\" said Ramos in an open letter on his personal website. \"All this triggered a situation which I hope will be turned around as soon as possible because the club and fans deserved it.\"</p> <p>Ramos also said that he believed that turbulence behind the scenes affected the players before the season even started. \"In the summer we experienced a difficult pre-season due to the changes in the squad, which prevented us from working with the tranquility that the summer preparation needs,\" he added. \"Furthermore the young age of some of the signings, despite their quality, means they needed some time to adapt and mature, which because of the urgency of the competitions they have not yet been awarded.\"</p> <p>Ramos was believed to be unhappy with the lack of control he was given over transfers at White Hart Lane, but accepted responsibility for Spurs' dreadful start to the season, which saw them claim just two points from their opening eight games.</p> <p>\"After almost 20 years in the game I know the unwritten rules of football and that's why I accept the decision taken by the leaders of Tottenham Hotspur,\" said Ramos, before defending his legacy at White Hart Lane. \"[Last season] we were able to qualify for Europe when it seemed almost impossible. We achieved it with a great effort on the part of all the team despite the enormous difficulties that we had. For this we can catalogue last season as tremendously successful.\"</p> <p>Many Spurs fans blame chairman Daniel Levy for the club's current woes and Ramos was quick to pay tribute to their support. \"You have always been with the team and I thank you for your unyielding encouragement,\" he said. \"I also want to send my heartfelt wishes to all the people at the club. To all the family that makes up Tottenham Hotspur, to this group of workers without whom nothing would work.\"</p>",
  "<p>After Ted Stevens, the Alaska senator, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/27/congress-usa-ted-stevens-guilty\">convicted yesterday</a> of seven felonies for failing to report more than $250,000 in gifts and renovations to his home by oilman Bill Allen, the statements that came rolling in from around the state were fairly predictable.</p> <p>The Alaska Democratic party called for Stevens, who is facing re-election next week, to \"immediately resign from the United States Senate\". </p> <p><a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/10/27/stevens-verdict-palin-reacts/\">Sarah Palin</a>, the governor of Alaska and John McCain's vice-presidential pick, couldn't resist the megalomaniac approach. \"The verdict shines a light on the corrupting influence of the big oil service company that was allowed to control too much of our state,\" she said. \"It was part of the culture of corruption I was elected to fight.\" This from a woman who was recently found to have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/14/sarah-palin-troopergate-election\">violated an Alaska state ethics law</a>. </p> <p>Congressman <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aYRvl8qE7Pn4&amp;refer=home\">Don Young said</a> that because the trial was held in Washington, Stevens didn't get a jury of his peers. \"Senator Stevens has done more for our state than anyone in Alaska's history, and I ask Alaskans to rally behind him with their support,\" he said. This from a man who is also under federal investigation and has <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/news/politics/fbi/young/story/377218.html\">spent more than $1m of his campaign funds on legal fees</a>. What exactly he's under investigation for is anybody's guess. He's not telling. He yells when you ask. </p> <p>McHugh Pierre, spokesman for the Republican party of Alaska, said: \"We support Stevens and we need to have him voted for and we need to have him win if Alaskans want to have a choice in the Senate.\" This from a party that has been besieged by corruption. Until the FBI arrived in 2006, Republican state legislators even wore hats that said: <a href=\"http://dwb.adn.com/news/government/story/8144643p-8038526c.html\">\"The corrupt bastards club\"</a>. Three of them are serving time in federal prison for bribery, and more are likely headed that way.</p> <p>More statements came rolling in, most starting with the phrase, \"It's a sad day for Alaska.\"</p> <p>Many of the people who wrote those words were indeed sad. In his 40 years as Alaska's senator, Stevens has worked tirelessly for this state. The money he brought from Washington helped build Alaska, modernise it, turn it from a backwater iceberg into something that in some places, at least, resembles civilisation. No matter what he's done, many Alaskans won't forget that. </p> <p>Mark Begich, the mayor of Anchorage, who is a Democrat and who is challenging Stevens for his Senate seat, might express the sentiment, but he's probably not that sad. In fact, someone described the mood in at his office as \"ecstatic\" when the news broke. </p> <p>Stevens has <a href=\"http://tedstevens2008.com/newsroom/press-release/senator-stevens-committed-to-keep-fighting/\">vowed to fight on</a>. Proclaiming his innocence, he said: \"I remain a candidate for the United States Senate. I will come home on Wednesday and ask for your vote.\" Now, though, many even in his own party are gently suggesting that his days as a senator are over. The polls, after all, were already tight before the verdict. </p> <p>Local pollster, Ivan Moore, who is from England but has lived in Alaska for 20 years, goes so far as to say that Stevens doesn't have a \"chance in hell\" of winning this election. He said this while sitting in a bar in the hardscrabble interior town of Fairbanks. A sign above the bar read: \"We love Senator Stevens.\" Around Alaska, bumper stickers read: \"I'll vote for Ted 'till he's dead.\" One local talkshow caller summed up a fairly common sentiment in Alaska when he said: \"I'll vote for a guilty Republican over a liberal any day\". </p> <p>These are the people Moore calls Ted's rock-solid base. He thinks that accounts for about 35-40% of Alaska's populace, which is why Moore doesn't foresee a blow out on election day. He predicts that Begich will win it by about 15 points. </p> <p>What awaits the diminutive man who <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/columnists/story.html?id=8e289eb3-7807-4e89-9245-00f5af05f919\">wore a Hulk tie on the Senate floor</a> when he was prepping for a fight, always for something for Alaska (roads, more money for septic systems for Alaska Native villages, airstrips and post offices, bus stations and federal buildings)? Maybe it's prison. Maybe it's here, back home, among the people who will always call him Uncle Ted. The people who will say: He might be a crook, but he's Alaska's crook. He's just one of us.</p>",
  "<p>The military seated a nine-officer jury yesterday and opened the no-contest war crimes trial of an alleged al-Qaida propagandist accused of creating recruiting videos for Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>In a surprise, six of the jurors, including the foreman, had previously deliberated the sentence of another military commissions convict, Australian David Hicks. Hicks is the former kangaroo skinner turned al-Qaida foot soldier who pleaded guilty to a terror charge in exchange for speedy release.</p> <p>This time, the jury will have more work. Today, the Pentagon prosecutor outlines his case and then starts calling witnesses in the estimated weeklong trial of Ali Hamza al-Bahlul, about 40, of Yemen.</p> <p>Bahlul allegedly produced an Internet-based video that glorified the October 2000 suicide bombing of the destroyer USS Cole in Yemen, which killed 17 American sailors. The video splices news footage of the crippled warship with bin Laden's calls to holy war, or jihad - and mixes in a splash of special effects.</p> <p>Al-Bahlul is also accused of working as bin Laden's media secretary and sometime bodyguard in Afghanistan before the September 11 2001, attacks. He also allegedly videotaped two of the September 11 hijackers' \"martyrs' wills\".</p> <p>Al-Bahlul, who faces a maximum of life in prison, sat mute at the defense table in a tan prison camp uniform under a self-styled boycott of the proceedings.</p> <p>He has forbidden his Pentagon-paid defense attorney to call a witness, ask a question or make an argument on his behalf.</p> <p>The judge, an air force colonel, Ronald Gregory, told the jury of US military colonels and navy captains that the burden is entirely on the prosecution to prove guilt. As in all trials, he said, the accused need not offer a defense.</p> <p>The strategy may prove a challenge to the typically talkative al-Bahlul. Across years of pre-trial hearings, he has delivered hourlong monologues in which he declared his devotion to bin Laden and rejection of the US military's authority to judge him.</p> <p>\"I will never deny any actions I did alongside bin Laden fighting you and your allies, the Jews,\" al-Bahlul said at his May arraignment. \"We will continue our jihad and nothing will stop us.\"</p> <p>Gregory ruled before the jury was selected that al-Bahlul's boasts in the war-court chamber would be excluded from the trial.</p> <p>This terror trial follows by two months the conviction of bin Laden's $200-a-month driver, in which a team of lawyers offered a spirited defense before a different panel of military officers. That jury ordered Salim Hamdan to serve the rest of the year in prison, a sentence the Pentagon is appealing.<br>This time there will be no defense.</p> <p>\"It goes against all of my training and instincts,\" said Air Force Reserve Major David Frakt, al-Bahlul's Pentagon-appointed attorney.</p> <p>Frakt, a law professor in civilian life, said he obtained an opinion from his New Jersey Bar that permits him to follow his client's wishes.</p> <p>Yesterday, he shook his head, indicating no, each time the judge called on him.</p> <p>\"Mr al Bahlul says we are spectators at a soap opera,\" he later said, explaining the Yemeni's reason for the boycott. He rejects the military commissions, he said, does not believe his activities were war crimes and respects only Islamic law.</p> <p>All the jurors' names were shielded from the public by court order. They included three army colonels, three navy captains, two Air Force colonels and a marine colonel with pilot's wings plainly visible on his uniform.</p> <p>The foreman, an Asian-American army colonel, also served as foreman at the Hicks sentencing in March 2007.</p> <p>A representative of the clerk of court's office, who was brought to answer reporters' questions on condition she not be identified, said the war court has four rotating panels.</p> <p>They were compiled from a pool of fewer than 100 pre-approved US military officers from all four services - and will be repeatedly called back to Guant\u00e1namo for the terror trials. With predictions that the Pentagon might prosecute up to 80 of the 255 detainees here, that means the same jurors might hear up to 20 cases - like a grand jury in civilian life.</p> <p>The Hicks jury sentenced the Australian to eight years - the maximum sentence sought by the Pentagon prosecutors.</p> <p>What they didn't know at the time was this: A Pentagon appointee had cut a deal with Hicks and the government of Australia to have him serve only the rest of 2007, most in his native Adelaide, and be set free.</p> <p>Hicks was home by New Year's Eve 2008, seven years short of the jury's sentence.</p>",
  "<p>My female partner and I have been together for almost 28 years. We raised the three children I adopted, but we are neither \"domestic partners\" nor do we plan on getting married any time soon. I am also the only openly gay member of the <a href=\"http://www.longbeach.gov/council/\">city council</a> for the California's fifth largest city, Long Beach, and I authored a resolution which expresses the full city council's opposition to <a href=\"http://www.voterguide.sos.ca.gov/title-sum/prop8-title-sum.htm\">Proposition 8</a>, a ballot measure that would prohibit same-sex couples from marrying in the state of California.</p> <p>So how do I reconcile these obvious contradictions? Perfectly. Because as an American I know that we take pride in having freed ourselves from a church state and intrusive government more than 200 years ago. The founders of the United States struggled mightily with the question of whether \"freedom of religion is compatible with order in government and obedience to the laws\" and concluded, as Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1808: \"State churches that use government power to support themselves and force their views on persons of other faiths undermine all our civil rights.\" <br> That the voters of California are only days away from possibly altering our state constitution to prohibit anyone but a man and a woman from marrying, thereby forcing a religious view into secular law, should strike observers as odd and un-American. Proposition 8 is on the California ballot because the California supreme court recently overturned a 2000 state initiative that used the very language being proposed to be inserted in the constitution this November 4. The proposition and prior initiative state in deceptively simple language: \"Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid and recognised in California.\" In May 2008, the California supreme court struck down that language and <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/06/04/national/main4152612.shtml\">ruled that the right to marry is a constitutional one</a> and \"has been recognised as one of the basic, inalienable civil rights guaranteed to an individual by the California constitution. \u2026 We conclude that, under this state's constitution, the constitutionally based right to marry properly must be understood to encompass the core set of basic substantive legal rights and attributes traditionally associated with marriage that are so integral to an individual's liberty and personal autonomy that they may not be eliminated or abrogated by the legislature or by the electorate through the statutory initiative process.\"<br> The <a href=\"http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/highprofile/\">court's ruling</a> made it clear that under the current California constitution, marriage could not be restricted to a union only between a man and a woman, which is the very reason <a href=\"http://www.protectmarriage.com/\">proponents of Proposition 8</a> are now attempting to eliminate the \"inalienable civil rights\" of individuals to marry whom they choose to marry by altering the state constitution.<br> The supporters of Proposition 8 are in fact waging a vigorous campaign with the assistance (financial and otherwise) of <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/10/27/BAP113OIRD.DTL&amp;tsp=1\">religious organisations</a> and are providing materials for church bulletins to remind their members that Proposition 8 \"restores the definition of marriage. God himself is the author of marriage. Its meaning is written in the very nature of man and woman as they come from the hand of the Creator.\" <br> These supporters also warn that without the passage of Proposition 8 \"Californians will be forced to not just be tolerant of gay lifestyles, but face mandatory compliance regardless of their personal beliefs.\" The only problem is that Proposition 8 would actually do just that \u2013 force mandatory compliance of a religious belief \"regardless of personal beliefs\". Proposition 8 proponents note (and I have to admit that I had agreed) that California has provided same-sex couples with the right to enter into \"domestic partnerships\" for several years \u2013 affording them with most of the same rights as are conferred with \"marriage\" and there was no need to extend the right to marriage to same-sex couples. However, the California supreme court's ruling also addressed this issue and found that by assigning \"a different name for the official family relationship of same-sex couples as contrasted with the name for the official family relationship of opposite-sex couples raises constitutional concerns not only under the state constitutional right to marry, but also under the state constitutional equal protection clause\". Finally, the court found no \"compelling state interest\" in maintaining the definition of marriage as between one man and one woman in as much \"permitting same-sex couples access to the designation of marriage will not deprive opposite-sex couples of any rights and will not alter the legal framework of the institution of marriage, because same-sex couples who choose to marry will be subject to the same obligations and duties that currently are imposed on married opposite-sex couples\". As an attorney I found these legal arguments persuasive.  I just recently authored <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Rosie-Riveter-Beach-Postcards-America/dp/0738525324/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1225136232&amp;sr=8-1\">a book</a> about the women who worked on the home front during the second world war so that this nation could defeat brutal dictators who viewed homosexuals, Jews and others as less than human.<br> For all these reasons, I cannot imagine anything so un-American as the taking away of \"inalienable civil rights\" and altering what constitutes \"equal protection\" in a state constitution on the basis of religious belief. That's why I am <a href=\"http://www.noonprop8.com/\">opposing Proposition 8</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Google is to pay $125m to settle the long-running lawsuits brought against it by American authors and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/publishing\">publishers</a> over its plans to scan in-copyright books in libraries without copyright holders' permission.</p> <p>The agreement, which is still subject to approval from the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, will see Google paying out $125m in total, of which a minimum of $45m will go to authors and publishers whose books were digitised without their approval. Google will also pay $34.5m to establish a book rights registry, and will cover legal fees.</p> <p>Authors Guild president Roy Blount Jr said the deal made \"good sense\". \"As an author, well, we appreciate payment when people use our work,\" he said. \"It's hard work writing a book, and even harder work getting paid for it.\"</p> <p>The agreement follows outrage from American publishers and authors three years ago, when they learnt of agreements struck by Google with certain American universities to scan books which were still in copyright, which would then be digitised and searchable online. American authors' body the Authors Guild led the charge against the search engine, filing suit in September 2005 along with a number of authors.</p> <p>It was followed in October by a lawsuit from five publishers \u2013 McGraw-Hill, Pearson Education, John Wiley, Simon &amp; Schuster and Penguin \u2013 who said they brought the action \"to prevent the continuing, irreparable and imminent harm that publishers are suffering \u2026 due to Google's wilful infringement, to further its own commercial purposes, of the exclusive rights of copyright that publishers enjoy in various books.\"</p> <p>The settlement agreed today \u2013 which Google, the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers described as groundbreaking \u2013 follows lengthy negotiations. The three parties said it would \"dramatically expand access\" to books in the US, particularly those that are still in\u2013copyright, but are out of print.</p> <p>Under the terms of the agreement, US readers will be able to preview up to 20% of most out-of-print books for free, with authors and rights holders of in-copyright but out of print works able to opt out of the arrangement if they choose.</p> <p>For in-copyright books that are still in print, readers will be able to find the books, but will not be able to view any portion of it unless its publisher has signed up to Google's partner programme. </p> <p>Google will also be offering institutional subscriptions, enabling academic or governmental organisations subscriptions for their members to access millions of titles.</p> <p>The book rights registry that Google plans to establish will enable US authors and rights holders to register their work so they can be remunerated for online revenue from their books.</p> <p>Association of American Publishers chairman Richard Sarnoff described the settlement as a win for everyone. \"From our perspective, the agreement creates an innovative framework for the use of copyrighted material in a rapidly digitising world, serves readers by enabling broader access to a huge trove of hard-to-find books, and benefits the publishing community by establishing an attractive commercial model that offers both control and choice to the rights holder,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Google's mission is to organise the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. Today, together with the authors, publishers, and libraries, we have been able to make a great leap in this endeavour,\" added Sergey Brin, co-founder and president of technology at Google. \"While this agreement is a real win-win for all of us, the real victors are all the readers. The tremendous wealth of knowledge that lies within the books of the world will now be at their fingertips.\"</p>",
  "<p>Most up-and-coming politicians glad hand and kiss babies with ease - but they don't always know how to spend their hard-won campaign contribution dollars.</p> <p>\"You know what? A yard sign doesn't actually vote,\" <a href=\"http://www.jesskingforsenate.com/\">Jessica King</a> said of new candidates who devote too much cash to printing posters. \"It just communicates your name. That isn't going to compel a voter to vote for you.\"</p> <p>A dose of Washington savvy from candidate training organisation <a href=\"http://www.progressivemajority.org/\">Progressive Majority</a> is helping King, an Oshkosh city council member, in her bid for a Wisconsin state senate seat. The group is building a stable of liberal candidates at the local, county and state level who one day could run for the House of Representatives or Senate. Or even the White House.</p> <p>Progressive Majority, whose $5m budget is funded largely by wealthy Democrats and left-leaning labour unions, identifies and recruits candidates through meetings with local party organisations and liberal groups. Staffers teach candidates the basics of developing a campaign strategy, honing a message, raising funds and writing a budget.</p> <p>\"If progressives are going to gain an enduring majority for change, we have to focus on government at every level,\" said Gloria Totten, the Washington-based group's president, borrowing a theme from Barack Obama. There's more at stake than zoning ordinances and garbage collection: State governments control $1.8tn in public money and half of the country's congressmen rose to Washington from state legislatures. After all, Obama served in the Illinois state senate before becoming a US senator and presidential candidate.</p> <p>Some conservatives question whether it's appropriate for a liberal, Washington-based group to try to sway small-town voters. Others doubt Progressive Majority can really make a difference.</p> <p>\"This is a centre-right country,\" said David Avella, the executive director of <a href=\"http://www.gopac.org/\">Gopac</a>, which trains Republican candidates running for state and local offices and stresses a message of lower taxes, limited government and strong national defense. Avella's organisation was founded in the late 1970s, when Democrats controlled the both chambers or Congress and the White House. Its website says Gopac's been credited \"with being a key catalyst of the Republican revolution that stormed the nation in 1994, sweeping in the first GOP Congress in four decades and leaving a record number of governorships and statehouses in Republican hands\".</p> <p>Progressive Majority was founded in 2001, as part of a Bush-era push by liberal Democrats to counter what they saw as a powerful conservative infrastructure that operated outside the Republican party but developed right-leaning candidates and talking points. That infrastructure, which includes rightwing think tanks, voter mobilisation campaigns and candidate development groups like Gopac, aimed not at winning the next election but at building a long-term movement.</p> <p>\"We have to be just as strategically focused as they have been,\" Totten said.</p> <p>To date, the group has backed 272 office-holders who support abortion rights, access to healthcare, open government and campaign finance and environmentally friendly development. Since 2004, 54% of its endorsed candidates have won, and Totten says it has helped win control of four state legislatures and 29 local governments for the Democrats.</p> <p>Having helped elect liberals to offices as disparate as the Garfield County, Colorado commissioner and the Eden Prairie, Minnesota school board, Progressive Majority trainers now work with 524 candidates in states across the country as they prepare for the next several election cycles.</p> <p>\"Where do we look when we recruit?\" asked US congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat and Progressive Majority supporter. \"We look at someone who has already been elected. So certainly, Progressive Majority, in its training programme, is a great source of candidates. We all see ourselves as part of a progressive movement that is trying to strengthen itself at every level and in every way\".</p> <p>Progressives say the group's mission is aided by an electorate dismayed by conservative policies that have engaged the US in the war in Iraq, weakened the US economy and virtually bankrupted the government.</p> <p>\"In areas where working families have been hit very hard by Republican policies, they're saying, 'We've had enough,' even though they've been traditional Republican areas,\" US senator Russ Feingold, a liberal Democrat from Wisconsin, said this summer at a rally near Oshkosh for King and other local Democrats. \"People are saying, 'We're going to vote our economic interests, we believe the Democrats are more interested in that.'\"</p> <p>King is a 33-year old bankruptcy attorney who works with individuals driven to insolvency in the US mortgage-lending crisis. Her district is fairly conservative and voted for George Bush in 2004 while the state as a whole narrowly supported Democrat John Kerry.</p> <p>With the help of a Progressive Majority trainer, Nicholl Caruso, King has crafted a message that includes anti-tax tones that resonate comfortably with Oshkosh's conservatives. Her campaign literature (printed in two colours rather than four to keep down costs) does not advertise her Democratic affiliation to avoid putting off conservative voters.</p> <p>Her opponent <a href=\"http://www.hopperforsenate.com/Home.aspx\">Randy Hopper</a>'s campaign expressed concern about Progressive Majority's involvement in the race, even though recent polls indicate the businessman from nearby Fond du Lac is leading King in a tight race.</p> <p>\"We're concerned about a liberal group based in Madison and Washington DC, that's taken an interest in electing a particular candidate,\" said Hopper's campaign manager Ryan Murray. \"Is Jessica King going to support the fairly moderate to conservative views of the district or represent the liberal agenda of groups from Madison?\"</p> <p>On a recent sunny afternoon, King dressed in a pink polo shirt, calf-length blue athletic pants and sneakers and hit the streets of a new housing subdivision on Oshkosh's outskirts to talk to voters. Forget the costly television advertisements and poll-tested rhetoric of a presidential campaign -this was door-to-door, face-to-face American democracy.</p> <p>King's pitch focuses on what she describes as a disparity in Wisconsin's income-tax system. Certain multinational corporations exploit loopholes allowing them to avoid paying state income taxes, while the state government passes tough spending mandates onto local communities. Towns and cities like Oshkosh are then forced to raise property taxes, driving King's clients into destitution, she explained to one voter after another as they peered at her through screen doors.</p> <p>\"I'm everyday dealing with people who are suffering from the mortgage crisis, and people who are like, 'OK, I've worked my whole life and now I'm reduced to [choosing between] cutting my prescriptions in half or eating,'\" she told one woman. \"Everyday I'm meeting with people who are losing their homes, they're really scared, and enough is enough.\"</p> <p>\"We need some changes, I know,\" the woman replied, nodding her head.</p> <p>Much of the Progressive Majority training programme focuses on the craft of political campaigning and could just as easily help a conservative win office. Some basic advice: Spend three hours a day knocking on doors, and another three calling potential campaign donors.</p> <p>Caruso, a political operative with a decade of experience in Wisconsin politics, has helped several other Oshkosh-area politicians, and with her help, the state Democratic party in 2006 won a narrow majority of the Wisconsin state senate. This fall, she hopes the 38 candidates Progressive Majority has endorsed can strengthen that majority and win back control of the Wisconsin assembly for the first time in 14 years. If they accomplish that, progressives in Wisconsin can close the corporate-tax loophole, enact equal-pay legislation, require the state to contract with US-based businesses, and tend to other priorities.</p> <p>Within a few years, maybe one of those liberal candidates will run for the House of Representatives and take the progressive message to Washington. But King may not be one of them. Asked if she aspires to higher office, she said, \"No, not at this time\".</p>",

And if you didn't exactly roll around the floor at that little bon mot clutching your aching sides, it doesn't augur too well for their music.<br> Still, they've got the perfect disclaimer. \"We are rubbish,\" they declare. They flaunt their imperfections. The tawdry, tacky nature of their music would appear to be a comment on something or other; we can't quite decide what. Is it a critique of chav culture, or of our snobbery towards said budget-bling underclass? Their targets are somewhat scattershot. Album opener Barbara is their take on Roxy Music's In Every Dream Home A Heartache, about a blow-up doll with which they'd like to procreate. \"Oh Barbara, I'd have kids with you,\" they sing over mock-jaunty piano-pop like Brian Wilson at his most deranged, \"such a shame that you don't have a womb.\" Lloyd Ganja is rappin' electro-reggae about a spliffhead who will \"piss on a woman if he's drunk\" on which the reprise from The Four Tops' Loco In Acapulco becomes \"a local going down the local\". Blaze On A La Maison is another sub-ELO number that artfully rhymes \"marijuana coup\" with \"love you overthrew\". Wheelie Bin, about how rubbish it is having to put your rubbish in different bins (\"I hope the council dies of all the nasty diseases that can get inside their bodies so they won't fuckin' bother me anymore\"), opens with a plug for ASDA before giving way to the tinniest, weediest rave, like Happy Mondays blaring out of a cheap transistor. Peter Cushing is a decent Beatles takeoff, or approximation of a facsimile of a Rutles pastiche, that says of the titular actor, \"He wasn't a Russian, but he could play one naturally.\" Which is true. Green Iguaneen is faux house that goes, \"Three bottles for a tenner, that'll keep your missus' legs open.\" It's all a bit low-rent, the comedy worthy at best of a bad E4 sketch show featuring a bunch of teens who still think it's the height of comedic subversion to reference body parts on TV. Nutswood makes explicit what we suspected \u2013 this stuff is probably hilarious after a couple of spliffs. \"There was drugs drugs drugs drugs drugs drugs drugs drugs loads of drugs\u2026\" chant our heroes over nursery rhyme music, like a stoner dolehead version of Monty Python's Spam. One Way Traffic announces, \"That's my asshole, that's not for what it was meant\". Is it a satire of homophobia, or the thing itself? Do tell, chaps. Meanwhile, Crazy Nigel features supperclub rat-pack muzak and Bernie Clifton sounds like Bernard Manning being strangled with phone cable. The SFA remix of Blaze On A La Maison is the only song here that you might imagine wanting to play more than once, with a proper psych-pop production and symphonic arrangement. The rest are one-joke affairs that don't bear repeat listens. Still, it vaguely amused us this morning. <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"It's simple, catchy pop with humour.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> It's as substantial as a Primark coat and as funny as the Sunday Night Project.<br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Sound good stoned.<br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Make sense sober.<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> The Tenants Supermen is released on November 24, preceded by download-only single Blaze On A La Maison.<br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Goldie Lookin Chain, Ween, Super Furry Animals, Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band.<br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/thetenantssupermen\">myspace.com/thetenantssupermen</a><br> Tomorrow's new band: Operahouse.</p>",

  "<p>A senior <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/whitehall\">Whitehall</a> official who left highly classified intelligence documents about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/alqaida\">al-Qaida</a> and the capabilities of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq\">Iraqi</a> security forces on a train was fined \u00a32,500 today by Westminster magistrates court after admitting negligence.</p> <p>Richard Jackson, 37, who was on secondment from the Ministry of Defence to the Cabinet Office at the time, 37, of Yateley, Hampshire, was charged under a section of the Official Secrets Act covering the safeguarding of information.</p> <p>It is the first prosecution of its kind and it had been widely assumed in Whitehall he would be disciplined by internal procedures rather than charged under the criminal law. The court heard he had already taken a \"drastic\" pay cut and effectively been demoted by three grades. </p> <p>The two joint intelligence committee documents were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jun/12/uksecurity.ukcrime1\">left on a train from Waterloo to Surrey on June 10</a>. They were discovered inside an orange cardboard envelope by a member of the public, who passed them to the BBC's security correspondent, Frank Gardner. He subsequently reported the loss.</p> <p>One of the documents was a seven-page report by the joint intelligence committee entitled Al-Qaida Vulnerabilities.</p> <p>Classified as top-secret, the intelligence assessment on al-Qaida was so sensitive that every document was numbered and marked \"for UK/US/Canadian and Australian eyes only\". It is understood the assessment also contained reports on the state of the Islamist terror network in Afghanistan and neighbouring Pakistan.</p> <p>The document reportedly contained names of individuals or locations that might have been useful to Britain's enemies.</p> <p>The second document, commissioned from the committee by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), contained an analysis of Iraq's security forces. It included a top-secret and in some places \"damning\" assessment of Iraq's security forces.</p> <p>The court heard a damage assessment carried out by the Cabinet Office found the loss had the \"potential to damage national security and the UK's international relationships but to date this appears negligible\". </p> <p>Jackson, who had taken the files home inadvertently, was \"physically sick\" when he discovered their loss. He spent much of his time throughout today's proceedings with his head in his hands.</p> <p>District judge Timothy Workman said: \"Had there been real risks to national security, a custodial sentence, possibly suspended, would have been inevitable.\" </p> <p>He said he had taken into account Jackson's good character, remorse, full cooperation and guilty plea. \"I am conscious that he has already paid a heavy penalty, a significant reduction in income and damage to his own and his family's health,\" Workman said. </p> <p>Jackson, who had a previous warning for not locking secret files in his safe, had accidentally picked up the files with some other papers as he left the office on June 9 and did not realise he had them until he was almost home, the court heard. </p> <p>As he returned them to the office the next morning, he put the orange folder on the seat beside him - then got off at Waterloo without them. By the time he realised, the train was already on its way to Woking. He then spent much of the day frantically visiting lost property offices in the hope of recovering the files.</p> <p>Neil Saunders, defending, said his client accepted his mistake but \"there was never any risk to any lives whatsoever\". </p> <p>He said: \"He was under extreme pressure at this time and it may well be partly because of his own role, the team he was leading and the work he was being asked to conduct that he has made this gross error of judgment.\" </p> <p>Jackson had a host of glowing references, which said he was \"someone who would never deliberately let anyone down\". </p> <p>Jackson, who has a wife and two stepdaughters, has been sent back to work at the MoD.</p> <p>Prosecutor Deborah Walsh said Jackson did not report the loss of the files until the following day as his immediate superiors were abroad. </p> <p>\"This delay in reporting delayed any action to recover the files,\" she said. \"There's ample evidence that Mr Jackson failed to take such care to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of the documents as somebody in his position may reasonably be expected to take.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jacquismith\">Jacqui Smith</a> today said she was sorry for \"ruffling feathers\" over plans to increase detention without charge for terror suspects to 42 days but insisted she was more concerned about the safety of the nation.</p> <p>Giving evidence to a joint committee on human rights about the legislation, which was defeated in the Lords earlier this month, a defiant home secretary insisted the measures were necessary.</p> <p>\"I felt there was a specific potential need to have in place legislation to hold people beyond 28 days,\" she said. </p> <p>\"I recognised that others took a different attitude, but nevertheless I still wanted to make sure that option was covered off so therefore \u2026 we put in place the potential for legislation if and when the need arose.\"</p> <p>In combative exchanges members of the committee condemned some of the language previously used by Smith in defence of the bill and questioned why she was more qualified that the head of MI5 in determining what kind of counter-terror legislation was necessary.</p> <p>Smith replied: \"I'm sorry if some feathers have been ruffled because of the language I have used \u2026 my priority is not whether or not people's feathers are ruffled; my priority is whether this country has available to it all the necessary legislative protections in the future.\"</p> <p>The home secretary accused opposition parties of blocking moves to find a cross-party consensus on the issue.</p> <p>\"Opposition parties failed to move one jot and thereby made it pretty difficult to find a consensus,\" she said.</p> <p>\"The reason why I was disappointed is that the Tory party had conceded there may well be circumstances in the future when it may be to detain them [terror suspects] longer than 28 days. That's presumably why they proposed bringing forward the Civil Contingencies Act to do that\u2026 What they failed to do, however, despite several meetings and numerous opportunities, is engage in constructive way forward to resolve the issue.\"</p> <p>Her comments come just a fortnight after the government was forced to abandon its parliamentary battle to allow police to detain terror suspects without charge for up to six weeks. Peers overwhelmingly rejected the proposal by 191 votes.</p> <p>Smith conceded at the time that the counter-terrorism bill would have to continue its journey through parliament without the 42-day measure.</p> <p>But in a face-saving gesture, she said the government would publish a bill containing the 42-day plan. This bill would be held in reserve to be introduced should there be a terrorist emergency.</p> <p>Baroness Eliza Manningham-Buller, the former head of MI5, was among those to have opposed the plans.</p>",
  "<p>After a while, Ralf Rangnick looked about as <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=TN066Q-XXiI\">comfortable as a Parisian feline on a date with Pep\u00e9 Le Pew</a>: the Prof from Hoff&#xa0;just couldn't take this outpouring of adulation anymore. \"Enough!\" insisted the man who can never quite shake off his geography teacher persona. \"This is a press conference, not a manager symposium.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/hoffenheim\" title=\"\">Hoffenheim</a>'s manager had just been asked - over and over again - about the secrets of his team's incredible season. <a href=\"http://touchline.onthespot.co.uk/guardian/StatsCentre.asp?Lang=0&amp;CTID=\" 12\"\" title=\"\">Top of the Bundesliga after nine games</a>. Most goals scored. Most chances created. <a href=\"http://www.101greatgoals.com/videodisplay/1703566/\" title=\"\">Hamburg humiliated</a>. Best football played. The establishment unnerved. Few would have predicted that Martin Jol's team would have met the upstarts from the middle of nowhere in a title summit in the Carl-Benz-Stadion on Sunday. Fewer still would have thought they'd ever read the line \"there was a gulf in class between the traditional power-house and new boys\" (S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung) as a tribute to TSG 1899 Hoffenheim's supremacy.</p> <p>Rangnick's ultra-attacking team, with five forward-thinking players, had been much too quick, skilful and crafty for the visitors. \"It was 3-0 after 36 minutes,\" lamented HSV defender Joris Mathijsen. \"That simply can't happen. I don't know what these guys ate before [the match], they were so much better than us.\" Sunday roast with potatoes, pasta, broccoli and rice, actually, but the real reasons for Hoffenheim's fantastic ascent to the top are to be found in the minds of the management, not in the stomachs of their players.</p> <p>\"Hoffenheim are distinguished by a strong belief in the success of a convincing plan and the smart employment of resources,\" gushed Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. While Rangnick is increasingly wary of giving too many of his training secrets away, general manager Jan Schindelmeiser was happy to explain the basic tenet of their thinking. \"Our player selection process is subordinate to our style of football,\" he said. \"We don't buy 30-year-old-players who can't handle our pace.\"</p> <p>In other words, the mythical \"leadership\" figure that many in German football still long for wouldn't be fit to tie Demba Ba's laces. \"Rangnick doesn't need rugged veterans who bring down the tempo to their level,\" noted S\u00fcddeutsche.</p> <p>Against Hamburg, the players' average age was a shade under 23. \"The Bundesliga has never seen such cool, collected novices before,\" wrote Berliner Zeitung. In fact, the only time a club have enjoyed similar success in their first ever season was 43 years ago when FC Bayern, Munich's smaller team, had come up with talents such as Franz Beckenbauer and Gerd M\u00fcller.</p> <p>The general unease about the \"test-tube club\" bankrolled by software billionaire Dietmar Hopp has (mostly) given way to amazement and joy in the face of beautiful performances by \"Circus Hoffenheim\" (Der Stern). Attempts to dismiss their success as something that was simply bought with lots of money are, in any case, futile in face of the facts.</p> <p>Half of \"Germany's new football heroes\" (Bild), men such as future German international Marvin Compper, were bargain basement cast-offs from other Bundesliga clubs. The others \u00ad\u00ad- Vedad Ibisevic, Chinedu Obasi, Ba, Eduardo - are moderately expensive unknowns that any half-decent team could have easily bought themselves. But they were looking elsewhere, or worse, only at the roster of their favourite player agencies (we'll mention no names, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/schalke\" title=\"\">Schalke 04</a>).</p> <p>What's more, Hopp has spent most of his 200m euros on infrastructure and the new stadium: the very things that more established clubs have naturally enjoyed for years, often at the expense of the German tax-payer.&#xa0;Hoffenheim's naked ambition, hunger for fast, sustainable progress and high-concept methods (some of their attacking moves are adapted from hockey) amount to a slap in the face for sides such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/eintrachtfrankfurt\" title=\"\">Frankfurt</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/hannover\" title=\"\">Hannover</a> or Bielefeld, who have been far too comfortable with their inoffensive irrelevance over the years. Hoffenheim \"show that mediocrity is not decreed by law,\" wrote FAZ.</p> <p>The best news is that those who want German football to modernise now have a second champion; they no longer need to pin all their hopes on J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/bayernmunich\" title=\"\">Bayern</a>'s hyper-pressurised environment of super-sized egos.</p> <p>\"They will go far with that team, meticulousness and strategic work in the background,\" said Klinsmann of the men who have taken up his revolutionary mantle. \"They will be among the top five at the end of the season, and based on their recent performances genuine title contenders, too.\"</p> <p>Rangnick was quick to distance himself from such talk. \"I don't care what happens in May, I care about the next game,\" he said. Hoffenheim play Bochum on Wednesday and anything but an emphatic win would be a surprise. Their reassuringly austere manager - \"Do you want me to dance on the table now?\" he asked on Sunday - will continue to act the kill-joy but that won't stop the music. This season, nobody parties like 1899.</p> <p><strong>Results:</strong> Leverkusen 2-0 Cologne, Schalke 0-0 Bielefeld, Hannover 1-1 Bremen, Cottbus 2-3 Frankfurt, Bayern 4-2 Wolfsburg, Gladbach 1-0 Karlsruhe, Dortmund 1-1 Hertha, Hoffenheim 3-0 Hamburg, Stuttgart 2-0 Bochum<br><a href=\"http://touchline.onthespot.co.uk/guardian/StatsCentre.asp?Lang=0&amp;CTID=12\"><br>Latest Bundesliga table</a></p>",
  "<p>The prospect that <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/name/nm0001814/\">Gus Van Sant</a> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/oct/28/periodandhistorical\">is to make a film</a> of Tom Wolfe's The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test fills me with mild trepidation. On the one hand Van Sant has form with the drug experience \u2013 the trippy scenes in <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0097240/\">Drugstore Cowboy</a>, although mildly ludicrous, made an honest stab at realising the nature of being whacked out. On the other hand, once you try and depict the more exotic forms of intoxication, you are open to making a big fool of yourself.</p> <p>The thing is: films about drugs are not the same as good druggy films. As a student, I experimented for three years with the notion that watching films under the influence of the major or minor hallucinogens was a good way of getting to their heart, exposing both hidden strengths and flaws. </p> <p>So, for example, I learned that no amount of LSD could turn <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0064276/\">Easy Rider</a> into a good film, whereas \u2013 and I don't think I'm the first to have discovered this \u2013 <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0078788/\">Apocalypse Now</a> becomes even more enjoyable under the influence of a jazz cigarette or two, and in fact can even be considered a substitute for the stuff if none is to hand. <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0088178/\">Stop Making Sense</a> on acid is an experience I will treasure to the end of my days. Whereas all the enormous hash brownie I had before seeing <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0102722/\">Prospero's Books</a> did was rob me of the articulacy I needed afterwards to express my disgust at Peter Greenaway's pretentious buggering-up of Shakespeare. Never again, I decided. </p> <p>Anyway, the obvious drug films \u2013 Roger Corman's <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0062395/\">The Trip</a> springs to mind (Peter Fonda - in a laundrette: \"let's communicate with our minds\") \u2013 are usually cynical entrapment exercises designed to part idiot stoned students such I once was from their cash. (See <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/34483/fear.and.loathing.in.las.vegas\">Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</a>. Or rather, don't.) </p> <p>Will Self and I seem to be the only people in the country who hate the film <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/67567/trainspotting\">Trainspotting</a> (the book's a very different animal) because it makes heroin use out to be hip and transgressive. The best drug films are the ones where the drug use takes place just off to one side. The film critic Antonia Quirke has pointed out that Robert Altman's <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0070334/\">The Long Goodbye</a> has Elliot Gould playing Marlow as the most stoned detective ever (check out the scene where he feeds his cat), and she's right. </p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/name/nm0758574/\">Walter Salles</a> is continuing to say, as he has done for at least three years now, that he's going to be filming that benzedrine-fuelled nightmare (\"that's not writing; that's typing\" \u2013 Truman Capote), On the Road. On the corny old grounds that the bad book makes the good film, we may well be in for a classic. But I think I'll pass.</p> <p>\u2022 Nicholas Lezard restricts himself these days to wine, beer, and the occasional gin and tonic</p>",
  "<p>Four fee-paying schools in Scotland have been ordered to improve access for poorer students or lose their charitable status.</p> <p>The four schools, including Hutchesons' Grammar in Glasgow and Merchiston Castle in Edinburgh, have failed to meet the \"public benefit test\" needed for a charity, the Office of the Scottish Charitable Regulator has ruled.</p> <p>Jane Ryder, the regulator's chief executive, said they had failed \"mainly due to significant fees and the fact that there was not sufficient help in place so that those who cannot pay the fees can also benefit from what the charity does.\"</p> <p>The schools, which also include Lomond school in Helensburgh and St Leonards in St Andrews, have been given 12 months to publish plans on how they will extend their bursary schemes, remove restrictions to access and greatly increase free facilities for local people.</p> <p>The financial risks of losing charitable status could be serious, the schools warn. About 50 Scottish independent schools registered as charities save approximately \u00a34.5m a year in taxes because they do not have to pay business rates or VAT. Losing charitable status could force up their fees by 5 - 8%, the sector claims. </p> <p>Today's rulings were made as part of the regulator's \"rolling review\" of Scottish charities. Of the 30 charities assessed in this phase, which included other schools such as the royal family's favoured fee-paying school, Gordonstoun, only the four independent schools were judged to be failing as charities.</p> <p>Hutchesons' and Merchiston, two of Scotland's best-known independent schools, said this morning they were \"disappointed\" by the decision but promised to address the regulator's criticisms.</p> <p>The OSCR said Hutchesons' fees were \"substantial\" yet it only gave 49 bursary places this year, equating to 2.8% of the total school roll of 1,750 pupils. At \u00a3312,115, the value of their places was only 2.1% of Hutchesons's income. </p> <p>The regulator noted that Hutchesons' properly targeted its bursaries at those most in need but compared to the size and wealth of the school, its schemes were too small and had \"unduly restrictive conditions and access\". </p> <p>Dr Ken Greig, Hutchesons' rector, posted a message on the school website to \"reassure current and prospective parents that we have no intention to increase fees, as we recognise that the majority of parents make considerable sacrifices to send their children to Hutchesons'.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We will continue to make it possible for intelligent children from any background to come here, through our bursary funds.\"</p> <p>Merchiston, a boys' school whose alumni include Sir Donald Aitcheson, the former chief medical officer, and Sir Peter Burt, chairman of ITV, has about 430 pupils and charges high fees, reaching \u00a316,395 a year for seniors.</p> <p>It has notable charitable projects, including mentoring at a local primary school, and scholarships for gifted pupils, partly in sports, the regulator said. </p> <p>One former pupil, the businessman and Tory peer Irvine Laidlaw, had also recently given a gift to the school of \u00a31m for fully-funded bursary places over the next five years. </p> <p>However, only 16 boys had means-tested bursaries, with just four getting 100% support. \"These arrangements were not currently on a scale sufficient to mitigate the exclusory impact of the fees,\" the OSCR said.</p> <p>Andrew Hunter, headteacher at Merchiston, said staff were already working on a plan to deal with the regulator's criticisms. But he said 10% of Merchiston's income already went on some form of support for pupils. \"We will work closely with OSCR to do all we can to fulfil its requirements,\" he said.</p> <p>Lomond school, a medium-sized school in the small seaside town of Helensburgh, west of Glasgow, educates officers' children from the nearby Faslane naval base and other military bases. </p> <p>It was criticised for allocating less than 1% of its wealth for means-tested support for poorer pupils, although 18.5% of its income was used on some support for pupils \u2013 largely fixed rate Ministry of Defence funding for service families.</p> <p>St Leonards in St Andrews, with 458 pupils, had \"very limited arrangements\" to allow poorer pupils to attend although the regulator acknowledged that its assisted places scheme was still in its infancy. Even so, this year only three pupils were given means-tested bursaries at a cost of 0.5% of the school's income.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>The House of Commons defence / foreign affairs committee is asking questions of <strong>David Miliband</strong> and <strong>John Hutton</strong> today.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>2:36pm:</strong> The first question is an assessment of the situation in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p> <p>Hutton says the situation in Basra, northern Iraq, is \"better\". He pays tribute to the armed forces.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>2:38pm:</strong> There's no doubt at all in my mind that the situation is completely transformed, he says. He's just been out there. He says his own security was entirely provided by Iraq security forces.</p> <p>In the south, it's also better, though al-Qaida continues to pose a serious threat.</p> <p>The general situation is better now than it has been for several years. Miliband says he agrees with that.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>2:40pm:</strong> A question on the length of time troops will be needed in future from Sir Menzies Campbell. Hutton says it's important to complete the training of the 14th Iraq troop division. British troops are doing a sterling job helping to train up the homeland forces out there. The other part of the mission is to complete handover of Basra international airport and he says he believes that can happen by the end of the year.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2:42pm: Sir Menzies Campbell</strong>, the former Lib Dem leader, presses Hutton further. Hutton says the government has no intention of maintaining forces in Iraq if the missions are completed. There might be an ongoing role for UK forces as we move to more \"normal\" bilateral forces, he says. </p> <p>But he hopes all can be reviewed in the early part of next year. That, however, depends on the security situation. If that deteriorates, everything might be changed. We hope by the early part of next year we can make some serious decisions about the forces in Iraq, he says.</p> <p>Campbell, whose party opposed the invasion of Iraq, then gets an answer from Miliband, who says you have to look at transition on all fronts: political, economic, and so on. It means the debate on Iraq takes place on a rather broader base, he says.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2:44pm:</strong> <strong>James Arbuthnot</strong>, the shadow trade secretary, asks about security and control. Hutton says he spoke to the Iraqi prime minister. He is in favour of the training of Iraq forces and is completely satisfied with the role of UK forces. </p> <p>We would support Iraqi forces in \"hard\" security operations if necessary, but the next few months is all about preparing the ground for a fundamental change of missions, he says. It's all very much about a union of minds and there's no discrepancy between the Iraqi government and prime minister and the UK.</p> <p>Arbuthnot challenges this, saying the prime minister seems to be under the impression that UK forces will be out of the fray early next year.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2:46pm:</strong> Hutton says he has not detected anything other than a willingness from Iraqi authorities to reach an agreement within an agreed time frame about the role of UK troops from next year.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>2:48pm: Bernard Jenkin</strong> (Con, Essex North) suggests that sizeable as the UK's footprint is in Iraq, it's now too small to make an impact. He refers to the \"charge of the nights\", when the involvement of UK troops paled in comparison to those of the US. </p> <p>Hutton disputes the claim that UK troops made a minimal impact. As far as US troops are concerned, there is cooperation about tactics. Our efforts in Iraq are succeeding, says Hutton, as he once more praises British troops.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>2:51pm:</strong> Jenkin says forces have not always been in the loop about operations in Baghdad. Lieutenant General Peter Wall - also giving evidence - chips in to say they found out about the charge of the nights at the same time as the US did. It was quite speedy in coming about, but a rather successful operation, says Peters. </p> <p>There was some outpacing by Iraqi troops, he concedes, but relations between our forces and the 14th division (Iraqi) are good. I don't think we have anything to be circumspect about, he says. The size of the force is appropriate to the task we are there to deliver. Peters goes on to cite the exponential rise in confidence by Iraqi colleagues.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>2:53pm:</strong> A question on the state of forces agreement currently being drawn up. is it being done with US forces? Hutton says the text being drawn up between the US and Iraqi forces will be used in the drawing up of the UK's own agreement. This would include all territories, including the navy.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>2:57pm:</strong> Back to the suggestion that the Iraqi prime minister would be quite keen to see the back of UK troops sooner rather than later. </p> <p>Wouldn't it be better to redeploy the troops to Afghanistan? Hutton says deployments to Afghanistan would be based on advice from military advisers. There is a strong case for more helicopter assets in Helmand and Afghanistan as a whole but no decisions have yet been made. As far as Iraq is concerned we are focused on completing the mission, he says.</p> <p>Miliband chips in to say that operations like the charge of the nights are focused on Iraqi decisions.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>2:58pm:</strong> The ministers are then asked about the \"internments\" in Iraq. </p> <p>Hutton says there has to be an understanding about the UK forces' presence in Iraq by the end of the year. Terms of reference are still under way. </p> <p>If it looks like a state of forces agreement doesn't look likely by the end of the year, then the government will need to look at a roll over of the UN mandate. </p> <p>On detention, there are two detentions in Basra of people who killed two British servicemen; the government would like to turn these men over to the Iraqi courts, but in the interests of the bereaved families, the men need to be tried, and it is frankly time they were, says Hutton.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>3:01pm: John Stanley</strong> (Con, Tonbridge and Malling) says removing the one-party regime in Iraq under Saddam Hussein scored a number of hits for human rights, but there have been a lot of downsides too, such as thousands of refugees, women's rights going backwards, and rising criminality.</p> <p>Will we be able to say when we leave that human rights have actually improved? </p> <p>Miliband takes this question, pointing out that the picture is different in different parts of the country. The economy is doing well, due to oil revenues. Democracy is getting stronger, due to a number of legislative moves. The balance of the ledger, in terms of human rights, will be positive, says Miliband. </p> <p>The next five years is about tackling the negative points and boosting the positive ones.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>3:05pm:</strong> He points to the constitution for Iraq, which enshrines better rights for women and religious minority groups. Stanley says yes but in real terms, how adequate are these constitutional changes, since women on the ground seem to be having a pretty torrid time.</p> <p>Miliband says it depends where you go in Iraq. The UK government needs to reiterate that such issues need to be taken seriously.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>3:11pm:</strong> Miliband draws comparisons between Afghanistan and Iraq, and points to their particular features to make the point that policing in Iraq is more advanced.</p> <p>Hutton is asked the total number of detainees held by British troops since the UK first invaded. Hutton doesn't have the figure to hand. All he can say is there are just two now. </p> <p>Wall says they only pass on detainees when they are confident about those handling the detainees. But are these reassurances valid, he is asked, given the UK's responsibilities under the Human Rights Act regarding the treatment of detainees. Wall says simply: \"Yes.\"</p> <p>Hutton says they do have reassurances that when they do pass on detainees, they expect high standards to be followed and look for guarantees from Iraqi forces.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>3:12pm:</strong> Jenkin asks whether the drop in detainees is due to the fact that the British leave it to the US to do the arrests. No, he is told. A question follows about the state of accommodation for troops, and for detainees.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>3:13pm:</strong> Miliband says troops, diplomats and aid workers are afforded the most secure accommodation possible of the highest standard possible.</p> <p><strong>Mike Gapes</strong> (Lab, Ilford South) lobs a question about the forthcoming elections in Iraq. How confident are ministers that the elections will be free and fair?</p> <p>Miliband says provincial elections are in January, the national ones in October next year. He says the political manoeuvring going on ahead of the provincials is very encouraging, since this is an ordinary pre-election activity.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>3:16pm:</strong> The number of groups positioning for the elections is also encouraging. There is a high degree of confidence that the provincial elections will prove to be a good advert ahead of the nationals next time.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>3:20pm:</strong> Gapes says there are still tricky issues, notably deBa'athification. Miliband says some controversial decisions were taken in 2003. Things have moved on. The deBa'athification law is good, but the proof of the pudding will be in the eating (ie application of the law).</p> <p><strong>Ken Purchase</strong> (Lab, Wolverhampton North East) raises economic resources. Could either minister give their assessment on the battle for resources and their fair distribution?</p> <p>Miliband says oil production is now back at pre-2003 levels - a source of massive income for Iraq. The way the UK could help contribute is in the way Iraq deals with neighbours, eg the blockage in Iraqi-Kuwaiti trade. </p> <p>The UK wants to help Iraq improve its capacity for exports. Hutton adds that the work of the Basra commission should help. He wants UK businesses to seek opportunities in Iraq. As our military mission changes, you have to look at the new challenges, he says.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>3:25pm:</strong> But the precondition to looking at economic development is the very security that he has been talking about.</p> <p>Purchase says there are serious delays on a law on hydrocarbons, which is holding back companies keen to invest. </p> <p>Miliband admits the hydrocarbon law is in limbo at the moment - it was referred back to an appropriate board but seems to have been stuck for the past 18 months.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>3:28pm:</strong> Iran is raised, and particularly insurgents in Iraq. Hutton says its important to check the borders to avoid groups getting back in. </p> <p>The UK doesn't like Iran's support for armed militia who stand outside the political process whose raison d'etre is to undermine the political process.</p> <p>Wall says these groups are less in evidence in Basra than they were a year ago. Nowadays its more to do with criminal activity and a little bit of internecine troubles. However, there is a sense that armed militia are a latent threat and, it is believed, getting endorsement from Iranian.</p> <p>There is a sense that there is Iranian orchestration, says Wall, and a sense too that these groups have not gone away for good.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>3:30pm:</strong> Miliband says it's not legitimate for Iran to support these armed groups. Slowly the neighbours of Iraq are coming to terms with the growing strength of Iraq. That is not to say that Iraq is in a position to define all its relationships, but it's in a much better place than three years ago, and even a year ago.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>3:33pm:</strong> 0n to internal conflict and the Kurds in Kirkuk. What's the threat of conflict in this disputed area, and what's the plan? Miliband says Iraq remains a deeply violent place. The forces of division are significantly more contained than a year or two ago. Ditto political containment. </p> <p>The benefits of retaining the territorial integrity of Iraq are seen and he has no sense that anyone is trying to pull away from that. Hutton says there are issues in areas such as Kirkuk and Mosul.</p> <p>On the Kurdish situation, Miliband says the Kurds have a lot to gain by staying within Baghdad politics rather than opting out.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>3:37pm:</strong> Gapes raises Syria. Miliband met with the Syrian foreign minister yesterday. What support was given to them to cope with refugees? Miliband says he was in talks for three hours, and there was no request for UK financial support. What about Jordan, asks Gapes. Miliband again says this was never raised on the shopping list of requests in bilateral talks.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>3:39pm:</strong> The discussion moves on to Afghanistan. Arbuthnot asks both ministers whether the situation is better or worse than last year. The situation is different in different parts of the country, says Miliband. Our forces \"more than hold their own\" and the Taliban are often \"repulsed\" as a result of British tactics. </p> <p>In Kabul, we have seen the high-profile attacks on aid workers, but not on the military, says Miliband. The situation in the east has significantly improved over recent months. In the conventional theatre and confrontation, there hasn't been a situation of the Taliban rolling back on UK gains. Miliband says the Afghans want to hear a clear message that they recognise that the mission is not just military, but also political.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>3:44pm:</strong> There are also gains in building up the Afghan national army, which is 60,000 strong at the moment. It is a vital sign of hope. Hutton, who has just been in Afghanistan, says there are reasons, despite the increase in violence, to be clear that the UK is making progress.</p> <p>The progress that struck him most when he was in Helmand province, alongside the great job being done by British troops, was the improvements in the national army, who are showing real signs of progress.</p> <p>He believes there have been reductions in violence in Kabul. It would be a huge mistake to overgeneralise, says Hutton.</p> <p>Arbuthnot says it is ministers' job to set out the narrative to the British public to say: we have right on our side, but also here's the strategy to succeed. He asks what is being done about that. </p> <p>Miliband says the mission is to ensure the Afghans themselves can handle the situation. But, just as he suggested for Iraq, he says the comprehensive approach needs to look at the economic situation, the social and the political, as well as the military.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>3:47pm:</strong> Miliband cites the interdependence of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Stability and security in one will not be achieved unless it is also achieved in the other. So it's about the capacity of international forces, and national forces in Afghanistan and Pakistan, to deliver the strategy. He lists some operational improvements, but adds that it is up to the Afghan and Pakistani governments to \"raise their games\". This time last year the two were not working together; this year they are. That's progress.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>3:49pm:</strong> <strong>Paul Keetch </strong> (Lib Dem, Hereford) wonders what other Nato forces are doing to play their role. He reads some press cuttings suggesting the situation is in a downward spiral. </p> <p>Miliband says the UK wants more countries to do more. The French government has committed to doing more and being at the heart of the Nato command structure; that is positive. Some smaller EU countries, per head of population, are playing their part eg Croatia (not yet part of the EU, but working on it). Miliband also points out again that this mission is not just military anyway.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>3:51pm:</strong> A member from the foreign select committee - (this is a joint session between the foreign and the defence scrutiny committee) asks whether it's true there is only one district under Afghan control. No, says Hutton. Wall says there is a clear \"hold and build\" strategy, which is designed to allow improved governance in the area. There is no point making military gains if you don't build on it and involve the Afghans in the process, he says.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>3:53pm:</strong> How big is the area, asks Gapes. It's the main swath of the Helmand valley and encompasses five districts and vast tracts of agricultural land and around six in 10 of the population in the province, he is told. </p> <p>Gapes asks whether it's true some of these areas have reverted to Taliban influence. Wall says no. The progress is incremental, since the effort is about building governance under an Afghan regime.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>3:55pm:</strong> That claim of controlling five districts is niggling away. One MP says MPs were told there was control over just one district. The issue of Taliban warlords, who fund private armies is raised. Do they still run these armies?</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>3:57pm:</strong> Miliband says he tries not to talk about <em>the</em> Taliban. Some are ideologically committed, whereas some are criminals. And insurgency involves not just the Taliban but also al-Qaida criminals. Warlords are not necessarily part of the insurgency. Afghanistan has never had a government in Kabul which held sway across the whole country, he says. But, yes, there are significant armed people funded by narcotics. He mentions the word narco-terrorism to encapsulate the problem.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>4:03pm:</strong> Hutton then chips in that there is significant support put in place to help the government deal with narco-terrorism. There is an indissoluble link between narco-terrorism and insurgency. </p> <p>We have to focus on this issue and seek some progress on it. A rather sickly sounding <strong>Adam Holloway</strong> (Con, Gravesham) suggests there is a peasants' revolt in Kabul against government corruption. </p> <p>Hutton disagrees, adding that efforts are being made to help the government. Yes, but what about the corruption, insists Holloway. Miliband says this issue is always raised, and corruption needs to be addressed. He says clean governance at a provincial level will help change the tide. </p> <p>It's important to put on record that Hamid Karzai is the elected leader of Afghanistan and that is why the UK does business with him, Miliband says, and the idea, suggested by Holloway, that he has just one contact in Kabul, is likely to be incorrect. </p> <p>Miliband says the international community have put their views forward on the need to stamp out corruption,and so indeed have the Afghan people.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>4:07pm:</strong> <strong>David Heathcoat-Amory</strong> (Con, Wells) asks why the UK government has allowed its aim to become anti-insurgency ie mission creep. if that's the case, UK troops will be tied up for ever. Terrorist threats are not just derived mainly from Afghanistan. It's too far removed from our own security to be a precise war aim against which we can judge our success.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>4:11pm:</strong> Miliband is getting a bit irritated now, folding his arms against his chest in response to a question from Campbell.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>4:12pm:</strong> Hutton is talking now, about security. To succeed in the counter-insurgency operation we have to succeed in a number of areas, he says, ie politics and governance. </p> <p>Regarding the level of insurgency, we should be realistic about the opponents we are facing. There's going to be a hard core of ideologues left on the ground. We have to give Afghan forces the capabilities to deal with them. If you're not comfortable with al-Qaida and its supporters running the country - and who is - you have to be all the way in in this campaign to be in a position to leave behind forces capable of dealing with the problems on the ground.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>4:14pm:</strong> Campbell says he takes it from that that British forces will stay in Afghanistan as long as necessary. Hutton says, \"Yes.\"</p> <p><strong>Linda Gilroy</strong> (Lab, Plymouth Sutton) asks if enough attention is being paid to winning the propaganda war. Miliband says Afghans do not want to go back to living under the Taliban. they want to know whether we will stick with them. He points out that the media go out there sometimes to do some \"honest reporting\" ie what they see not what they are being told by the military.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>4:18pm:</strong> <strong>Robert Key</strong> (Con, Salisbury) tells the ministers he fears that western liberal democracy is so unlikely to flourish in Afghanistan that time might be wasted talking about democracy, rather than focusing on stability. </p> <p>Miliband says that's a profound debate. Does one come before the other, or do they need to happen together? His view is that some of the features of a democratic nation ie elections are an important part of the Afghan situation.</p> <p>But it's important not to read from that that we're trying to impose British suburbia in Afghanistan. We understand the absolute centrality of security but to then say \"Don't bother with a national government\" is not the right view to take, he says. It's important to try to persevere with national elections.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>4:21pm:</strong> Jenkin switches to the US presidential election. He says both Barack Obama and John McCain have committed themselves to a \"surge\" in Afghanistan like the one in Iraq. Will Britain be required to send more troops?</p> <p>Hutton says he can't speculate on the request that may or may not be forthcoming. We are pulling our weight, he says. We welcome the additional US forces, but it can't be left to the UK to fill in all the gaps. Jenkin says if there is a commitment to further militarise, you then have to give British troops further resources. Hutton says if he receives advice that more British troops are needed he will look at that carefully but he says \"I have received no such request\" for increased force levels.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>4:25pm:</strong> But Hutton concedes there are areas that need looking at, such as helicopters. I'm not going to say there are not areas there to look at but I'm not going to sit here today and speculate about troop numbers, he says.</p> <p>Ministers are told the fear is that \"we appear to be going backwards rather than forwards\" eg NGOs claim that they don't have the free movement they used to have. Hutton takes issue with this. It's a great disservice to put things in these terms. </p> <p>There are fundamental issues that need to be addressed but you will see areas of significant progress, he says. He urges the MPs \"not to fall into the trap of generalising\".</p> <p>The MP tries to explain what he means. Ability to travel is not as it was, he says.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>4:29pm:</strong> Miliband picks up the problem with transport on the highways. He says the question of security on the roads has gone up the agenda.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>4:32pm:</strong> He mentions the difficulties with policing borders with Pakistan. The Pakistani army is actually quite well-numbered on the border.</p> <p>Gapes asks about the relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Mark Lyall Grant, the director general political of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, who is also on the panel, is asked about how optimistic he is about relations. </p> <p>Grant says Pakistan needs some help with the economy. But there is a strategic opportunity under the new prime minister now in place. Stanley asks the geographic area over with Karzai has control. Is it as low as 20%?</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>4:35pm:</strong> No, says, Miliband, I wouldn't. Stanley's point is that the scale of the task means \"we're in it for the long haul\".</p> <p>Listing a number of countries, such as Canada and Australia, who are on the brink of pulling out, Stanley asks Miliband to confirm the number of countries in it for that long haul. </p> <p>Miliband says the German government has just agreed to increase its military - as well as aid - contribution. You raise a serious point vis a vis how the burden is shared amongst countries, says Miliband, but it's worth reflecting that a country that probably had the biggest debate about troop involvement, Germany, has just made its commitment. </p> <p>It's right to say it's tough and difficult, but I don't think it's right to say we are the last ones on the bridge, the foreign secretary says.</p> <p>Stanley says all he asked was how many other countries had said they were committed to being there for as long as it takes.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>4:37pm:</strong> Miliband says there is widespread recognition that this is a long haul. No one is under the impression it's a quick fix.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>4:41pm:</strong> Purchase recalls the mantra: \"If we don't go to Afghanistan, Afghanistan will come to us.\" This is true of terrorism, but also of the drug trade, he says. Shouldn't we really be putting a great deal of effort into stopping the trafficking routes that are well-known in Afghanistan to stop the trade of narcotics?</p> <p>Hutton agrees. the target should be narco-traffickers not the small farmers. He cites the decrease in opium production and cultivation. The problem has quite manifestly not being resolved, and there is a shared concern with Afghan police that we have to seriously tackle the problem. </p> <p>With that the two-hour session draws to a close.</p>",
  "<p>Today's announcement that the government is to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/28/terrorism-uksecurity\">name and shame</a> a list of foreign-born \"preachers of hate\" who will be denied entry to the UK bears all the hallmarks of a PR gimmick designed to make the home secretary look as if she is being tough on those who promote terrorism.</p> <p>A list of more than 200 foreigners \"suspected of stirring up tensions\" will be made public and is expected to include anti-abortionists, animal rights extremists and holocaust deniers as well as extremist clerics.</p> <p>This is not how a confident democracy should be responding. What is wrong with the good old-fashioned method of simply upholding the law, ie allowing these people to visit the UK like everybody else and then prosecuting them if they happen to break the law?</p> <p>This morning's Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/28/jacqui-smith-extremists-home-office\">reports</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The burden of proof is to be placed on the individuals concerned by demanding that they refute accusations made against them by publicly denouncing or retracting their reported views.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This is a strange inversion of all principles of natural justice. If the government believes these individuals are up to no good then it is for the government to establish this in a court of law. The presumption should be innocence until proven guilty, not the other way round.</p> <p>Several of today's papers focus on the example of Omar Bakri Mohammed, the former leader of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Muhajiroun\">al-Muhajiroun</a> who departed these shores in 2005 after living here for more than 20 years and was then barred from ever returning to this country by the Home Office. Now there is certainly a legitimate question to be asked about why Bakri was ever allowed to settle in the UK in the first place \u2013 but that is a separate matter from refusing him entry to the UK just because we find his views objectionable. Make no mistake: many of Bakri's pronouncements were disgraceful. He revelled in the tabloid attention that his grotesque views attracted, and many British Muslims \u2013 myself included \u2013 breathed a sigh of relief when he decided to relocate elsewhere. But to reiterate my basic point: simply having odious views is not and should not be a reason to refuse people entry to the UK. </p> <p>The same also goes for holocaust deniers. However nutty their views may be, the best response to holocaust deniers must be to publicly and systematically demolish their arguments, not by seeking to refuse them entry to the UK or, as in parts of Europe, imprison them because they hold some repulsive opinions.</p>",
  "<p>Hatem Ben Arfa was not at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/marseille\" title=\"\">Marseille</a> last season when coach Eric Gerets threw a half-time wobbly at Karim Ziani during the team's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmdWysbKH04\">French Cup defeat at the hands of non-league Carquefou</a>. If he had been, he may have thought twice before refusing to warm up following his demotion to the subs' bench for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1UnCsJfTrE\">L'OM's 4-2 home defeat</a> by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/parisstgermain\" title=\"\">Paris St Germain</a> on Sunday night. Gerets \u2014 who last season had reportedly picked up Ziani by his shirt and thrown him across the changing-room, shrugging off the incident by saying \"no one ended up with a broken nose\" \u2014 was not impressed by Ben Arfa's behaviour. \"No player has ever done that to me in all my [16] years as a coach and he will get what's coming to him,\" was his response after the game.</p> <p>Coming from a man who, according to former players, used to hang up those he felt had under-performed on coat-pegs and kick in changing-room doors after a defeat, Gerets showed remarkable restraint. After all, he was speaking after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/marseille\" title=\"\">Marseille</a>'s first league loss of the season, their first at home to PSG for five years and the first time they have ever allowed their biggest rivals to score four at the V\u00e9lodrome. And as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/lyon\" title=\"\">Lyon</a> had drawn 0-0 with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/auxerre\" title=\"\">Auxerre</a> on Saturday, L'OM also blew their chance to top the table.</p> <p>Gerets has since made up with Ben Arfa. \"I'm happy with the way I controlled myself during our chat, as at other times it could have been something that ended with injuries to both sides,\" he said, while Ben Arfa interrupted his coach's Monday press conference <a href=\"http://www.lequipe.fr/Football/breves2008/20081027_145817_ben-arfa-s-est-excuse_Dev.html\" title=\"\">to publicly apologise</a>. \"I'm a competitor and I admit what I did was wrong, and I have said sorry to the coach.\" This is the same Ben Arfa who caused dressing-room unrest at Lyon, had a bust-up with team-mate Modeste M'bami during L'OM's warm-up before the European match against Liverpool, and who, when asked to play on the left in a League Cup defeat to Sochaux, told Mathieu Valbuena to move to the left so he could play in the middle. He recently told <em>France Football</em>, \"I don't care what people think of me.\" When William Gallas reportedly revealed that a young player had told him to \"fuck off and worry about your own game\" after he had offered some advice during a France international training session, Ben Arfa was rumoured to be the culprit.</p> <p>The row overshadowed one of the best results of Paul Le Guen's career as PSG coach, and will now surely end Didier Deschamps's ambitions of replacing him anytime soon. After J\u00e9r\u00f4me Rothen's autobiography <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2008/oct/01/ligue1football.parisstgermain\" title=\"\">brought one type of headline to PSG</a>, this week it was the turn of <a href=\"http://www.leparisien.fr/psg-foot-paris-saint-germain/alain-cayzac-raconte-les-coulisses-du-psg-21-10-2008-283352.php\" title=\"\">former president Alain Cayzac</a>, who revealed in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.fr/Passion-impossible-Alain-Cayzac/dp/2354170378\" title=\"\">Impossible Passion</a> that Yoann Gourcuff's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2008/oct/21/ligue1-football-frenchfootball-europeanfootball-france-lyon-bordeaux-toulouse-acmilan\" title=\"\">proposed move to PSG last year</a> was blocked because his father Christian <a href=\"http://www.lequipe.fr/Football/20081021_083114_pourquoi-gourcuff-a-refuse-paris_Dev.html\" title=\"\">did not want Le Guen coaching the youngster</a>. The pair, both Bretons, apparently fell out when the elder Gourcuff replaced Le Guen at Rennes in 2001.</p> <p>This week, Le Guen made two big decisions, one impacting on the other. First he selected a reserve side for Thursday's Uefa Cup loss to Schalke, for which he was widely criticised. Then, with a newly refreshed first team at his disposal, he picked an attacking 4-3-3 formation at Marseille in which Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9le was the only defensive midfielder. P\u00e9guy Luyindula, who scored one and set up another, once again looked like the player who won three titles at Lyon while Mateja Kezman, the striker foisted on Le Guen by perma-tanned owner <a href=\"http://www.efelant.net/planete/charles_villeneuve.jpg\" title=\"\">Charles Villeneuve</a>, stayed on the bench.</p> <p>But the star of the show was Guillaume Hoarau, who opened the scoring with PSG's fifth consecutive headed goal (despite closing his eyes as he made contact) before having the good grace not to claim a touch when Rothen's free-kick went in through a bundle of players. His second strike allowed him to join Karim Benzema at the top of France's scoring charts. \"You can understand why Raymond Domenech is now beginning to think of Hoarau,\" wrote <em>L'Equipe</em>, who rated him nine out of 10 and compared him to Peter Crouch. \"There's something good happening in this team, and we have to make sure we hang on to it,\" said Hoarau, \"but I would prefer you not to talk too much about me.\"</p> <p>PSG are now just two points behind second-placed Marseille and will leapfrog Toulouse if they beat them on Wednesday night. But there are still some concerns: goalkeeper Mika\u00ebl Landreau was at fault for both Marseille goals, the Schalke defeat showed up the lack of depth in the squad while another Villeneuve signing, Ludovic Giuly, is still struggling for fitness. The owner's obsession with big-name players has now extended to Ronaldo, who has <a href=\"http://www.lequipe.fr/Football/20080919_002535_ronaldo-son-retour-le-psg_Dev.html\" title=\"\">confirmed he's in talks with PSG</a> recruitment director Alain Roche. Considering Le Guen deemed Kezman too high-profile, you can imagine his response to that. Newcastle's <a href=\"http://www.lequipe.fr/Football/breves2008/20081027_092517_n-zogbia-interesse-le-psg_Dev.html\" title=\"\">Charles N'Zogbia is also a target</a>.</p> <p>PSG were the only side in the top six to win at the weekend, as Lyon showed signs of fatigue following their midweek 5-3 Champions League win over Steaua Bucharest. They escaped from Auxerre with a goalless draw, but were lucky as Dennis Oliech hit the post, and they could also have had goalkeeper Remy Vercoutre sent off. \"I think it's a decent result for us, considering we were all a bit knackered,\" said Ederson.</p> <p>Bordeaux somehow failed to capitalise, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D22qZY5hiU\">drawing 2-2 at Nice</a> despite being 2-0 up with six minutes left. At that point, Eric Mouloungui pulled one back from a clearly offside position. \"If the linesman could not see that goal was offside, then we have a serious situation here,\" said Bordeaux's coach, Laurent Blanc. Worse was to come, as referee Tony Chapron awarded a 96th-minute penalty after the ball struck the top of Pierre Ducasse's arm. Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my made no mistake from the spot to leave Bordeaux defender Marc Planus fuming: \"It's a scandal.\"</p> <p>Nice coach Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Antonetti accepted Chapron had messed up but, considering his team were on the receiving end of some shockers in week five, <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6qvdd_resume-lyon-nice-3-2_sport\" title=\"\">when Lyon came back from 2-0 down to beat Nice 3-2</a>, he remained unrepentant. \"I propose that we give Bordeaux the two points that they were deprived of,\" he said, \"on the condition that Nice are given all the points that we've had robbed from us due to bad refereeing this season.\" Given that the linesman who missed the offside was in fact a lineswoman, Corinne Lagrange, the subsequent debate in France means it might be a while before Sabine Bonnin, the female referee who made her Ligue 2 debut in Angers' win over Tours at the weekend (coming on at half-time to replace her injured brother-in-law) moves up to the top flight.</p> <p>Grenoble continued their excellent start to the season with a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9uCDS5hr_0\">2-0 win at St Etienne</a>. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXP9e-HX8OM\">Caen's hero as they came from two goals down to draw 2-2 at Lille</a> was once again Steve Savidan, France's favourite former dustman, who last week revealed he still takes out the bins at home. \"I was ashamed when I was 20 and wore a bright yellow jacket and big work boots, but one thing I learnt from those days was solidarity. We all looked out for each other,\" he told <em><a href=\"http://darren.blog.canal-plus.com/archive/2008/10/17/fabulous-sport-steve-savidan-vous-repond.html\" title=\"\">Fabulous Sport</a></em>. His former club Valenciennes are now 19th after <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZK722UZOM0\">losing 2-1 to Le Havre</a>, their fifth straight defeat. They are winless away in 15 months and, with no Savidanho to bail them out at home, look in big trouble.</p> <p>Bordeaux could join Lyon at the top if they beat Le Havre on Tuesday, before a full round of action on Wednesday night. \"It's a shame we don't have longer to enjoy this win over Marseille, what with all the games this week,\" admitted Hoarau, but he should look on the bright side. Last weekend's games were the ones set aside for strike action. Perhaps someone forgot to tell Ben Arfa it was called off.</p> <p><strong>Results:</strong> Auxerre 0-0 Lyon, Rennes 2-2 Le Mans, Nice 2-2 Bordeaux, Lille 2-2 Caen, Lorient 3-0 Nantes, Le Havre 2-1 Valenciennes, Toulouse 0-0 Monaco, Saint-Etienne 0-2 Grenoble, Nancy 1-1 Sochaux, Marseille 2-4 PSG<br><a href=\"http://touchline.onthespot.co.uk/guardian/StatsCentre.asp?Lang=0&amp;CTID=23\"><br>Latest Ligue 1 table</a></p>",
  "<p>A recession is well and truly here if you look at the newspapers and see the daily tally of redundancies and closures. Indeed, ITN has just started doing its daily count on its late evening bulletin \u2013 just as it did in the 1980s. Most economic analysts believe the recession will be long and deep not short and slight. So there is agreement that the number of unemployed will be between 2 and 3 million by some time next year.</p> <p>This then means that unions \u2013 as the biggest and most important defender of workers' jobs \u2013 need to start doing two things. The first is to look back to the last recessions of the 1980s and 1990s to see what strategies and tactics they used then to try to combat redundancies and job losses. The second is to review how effective these tactics were then and how effective they might be now in an economy that is significantly de-industrialised compared to before.</p> <p>Unions are, ironically, in a stronger collective position to bargain with an employer where there are compulsory redundancies because they can negotiate en masse for their members. They are in a much weaker position when there is a call for voluntary redundancies because their members may take up these offers on an entirely individual and random basis.</p> <p>The obvious response to job cuts is to strike, either to stop the job losses or to improve the severance terms. But the bitter lesson of the 1980s is that this often plays straight into the employers' hands because striking is a civil breach of contract \u2013 this means employers can effectively let workers sack themselves and do so without receiving any pay off. The employer can simply afford to wait out the time until workers have no statutory protection from striking lawfully.</p> <p>The other side to the coin is that if an employer wants to make mass redundancies \u2013 and even taking into account that employer greed is always a factor \u2013 this usually does mean the marketplace for their goods and services is very poor. Striking does not change these laws of supply and demand. Indeed, it may only make things worse by eroding what market share that remains for any employer.</p> <p>Indeed, if an employer is going bust, the best thing workers can do is occupy the workplace rather than go on strike because striking means standing outside the workplace while <a href=\"http://libcom.org/news/scotland-sacked-workers-occupy-blockade-factories-05022007\">occupation</a> means at least maintaining control from the inside of assets that can be used as bargaining chip. The most obvious and successful version of this was the <a href=\"http://www.gcal.ac.uk/radicalglasgow/chapters/ucs_workin.html\">UCS work-in in Scotland</a> in 1971.</p> <p>The one big significant exception to the strike option is if the employer is either part of the public sector or dependent upon public sector contracts. Here, the unions can apply political pressure on the council or government and hope to make some difference by turning the issue into a political hot potato. So this is also the lesson for workers in the private sector \u2013 if you are going to go on strike to stop job cuts, make the strike a political (not economic) one.</p> <p>The demands of strikes and occupations may not just be about saving existing jobs but creating new ones, retraining and reskilling workers. The old demand of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swords_to_ploughshares\">swords into ploughshares</a> takes on a new meaning now. </p> <p>Traditionally, unionised workplaces have operated \"last in, first out\" policies to give job security to the longest serving workers and stop employer favouritism, discrimination and victimisation. \"Last in, first out\" has just been <a href=\"http://newsweaver.co.uk/unite/e_article001239981.cfm?x=bdB6h34,bbcvq3vv\">upheld in the high court</a> as lawful and so gives unions some way of controlling redundancies where there is not total closure. But it is a measure of damage limitation only.</p> <p>Short-time working, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/23/jcb-pay-cut-jobs\">like at JCB</a>, is one way of spreading the pain more widely but also more thinly so that workers remain in post but on reduced wages. The hope is that this would only be a temporary measure. If it does not work then, the other options recounted here would need exploring.</p> <p>Finally, when employers walk away from a business, workers often try to keep it going by <a href=\"http://www.amielandmelburn.org.uk/collections/mt/pdf/85_04_02d.pdf\">turning it into a cooperative (pdf)</a>. Since the 1970s, workers establishing cooperatives often worked harder for themselves and for less than they did for their capitalist boss and ended up losing their savings and jobs to boot. So trying to turn an existing failing conventional business into a successful cooperative one is extremely difficult. But that does not mean that workers should not be given the start-up capital from government to create new and different cooperatives to keep themselves in work.</p> <p>Whatever the unions do, there is no sign that they will engage in racist, exclusionary strategies of the kind that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/sep/10/workandcareers.immigration\">Gordon Brown implicitly encouraged</a> last year. But the fight to maintain workers' living standards and dignity will take a lot more than just rejecting the wrong strategies. It will require updating and reworking the bits of those that showed most promise last time round.</p>",
  "<p>My friend Dan thinks he's going to live forever. He's not religious, or one of those who believes that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie_Restriction_Society\">extreme calorie restriction</a> will let him live a thousand years (or perhaps just feel like he is). No, thinking it through logically Dan has decided that the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity\">technological singularity</a> is likely to happen in his lifetime. <br> According to this theory, popularised by <a href=\"http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/misc/WER2.html\">Vernor Vinge</a> and <a href=\"http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/meme/memelist.html?m%3D17\">Ray Kurzweil</a> among others, within the next 25 years humanity will create a superhuman intelligence, one that is capable of creating intelligences greater than its own. Humanity will no longer control the pace of technological development, which will rapidly advance to the point that our entire environment is directed by artificial intelligences. <br> And then, Dan reckons, if these intelligences are friendly, we'll all be \"uploaded\" \u2013 our entire personalities will be copied into the vast memory banks of these AIs \u2013 and we'll live forever. More than that, we'll be able to spend time with our friends, we'll never experience pain or suffering again, all imaginable forms of entertainment will be available to us, along with some that can't be imagined at all. We'll be happy, stimulated, in pleasant company for all eternity. Of course, this is a remarkably similar promise to the assurances various religions have been giving for the past few thousand years. The technological singularity has been called the <a href=\"http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=040506B\">Geek Rapture</a> or Rapture of the Nerds, referring to the belief held by some Christians that they will be taken up bodily into heaven to be with Jesus before the Day of Judgment. I'm fascinated by the similarities with religion; perhaps it's simply impossible for many people to comfortably accept that they really are going to die, that nothing will come afterwards, that there's no hope of rescue. If we can't believe in God, could technology be the way, the truth and the life? <br> I'm reminded of the Doctor Who spin-off Torchwood, which is very robust in its constant assertion that there is nothing after death. In the very first episode, the team of alien-hunters uses a \"resurrection glove\" to momentarily bring a murdered man back to life. Asked what he saw after death, what there was to be seen, the murder victim replies, \"Nothing. I saw nothing. Oh my god, there's nothing.\" And yet this statement was retrieved using this imaginary technology, the resurrection glove. One of the characters in Torchwood is immortal, others die and are returned to life using various pieces of alien gadgetry. Even for those who believe that they don't believe in life after death, it seems impossible to stop imagining technological solutions to the problem.  Perhaps this is because of the vast array of problems technology can solve. We can speak to people on the other side of the world, fly through the air, carry the music of hundreds of orchestras with us in our pockets; why wouldn't technology one day enable us to live forever? Or perhaps it's simply a quirk of our brains; <a href=\"http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=never-say-die&amp;ec=su_neversaydie\">Scientific American magazine</a> and <a href=\"http://arts.theguardian.com/pictures/image/0,8543,-10404640117,00.html\">artist Damien Hirst</a> agree that the mind of a living being cannot conceive its own demise. Either way, I've agreed to try to get Dan into Jewish heaven if he puts in a good word for me with the Technological Singularity. That way we're both covered.</p>",
  "<p>\"What are you looking for?\" Our heads turned. We were bent over our canvassing packet, trying to figure out where our tally went wrong. Turns out I failed to notice that Patterson was the street after 30th, not 31st. I had messed up the list of doors assigned to us. We'd have to go back. \"We're knocking doors for Obama,\" I shouted back. \"Who are you voting for?\" He was youngish, maybe mid-thirties, wearing a faded Red Sox baseball cap and standing next to a pickup truck emblazoned with Ron Paul bumper stickers. When he heard my reply, he stiffened. </p> <p>\"I'm sure as hell not going to vote for any nigger!\" he shouted and disappeared into his driveway. </p> <p>This is a real story, and it happened here in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erie\">Erie, Pennsylvania</a>. It isn't typical of Erie \u2013 this was the first and only time something like this has happened in the city since I moved here from Montana and started volunteering for the Obama campaign, but it gives me permission to express the frustration I've felt about the city's tepid embrace of Barack Obama.</p> <p>Erie sits atop the thumb of Pennsylvania land that reaches up and kisses Lake Erie. The city proper has about 100,000 people; the greater metropolitan area, 240,000. Erie lies at the center of a triangle of northwestern cities: Cleveland to the west, Buffalo to the northeast, and Pittsburgh to the south. Wracked by wind and deep snow in the winter, it's an industrial city \u2013 or it was an industrial city. In the 20th century it was a shipbuilding center, a railroad hub and a producer of steel and iron until \u2013 like elsewhere in the Midwest \u2013 the jobs dried up when the factories went overseas. </p> <p>Tucked among the parks and lines of single-family homes and cracked sidewalks are the ruins of steel plants and immense warehouses overgrown with weeds. At the end of the school day, kids in Catholic school uniforms crowd the ice cream shop and teen joggers run in packs along park paths. Eerie is <a href=\"http://www.visiteriepa.com/\">quickly becoming a tourist town</a>. The city's main attraction is Presque Isle, a park on a spit of land jutting out into the lake and ringed with beaches and bike paths, and Ohioans, Pennsylvanians and New Yorkers flock on the summer weekends for the water slides, amusement parks and the cool breezes and water of a lake swim. There's a new library on the waterfront where the replica of the brig Niagara floats. It was built to honor the battle of Lake Erie in the war of 1814 where Commodore Perry defeated a British squadron and secured Detroit for the fledgling US. Perry wrote the famous words to his superiors, \"we have met the enemy and they are ours,\" a slogan not befitting the town, which seems more resigned or weary than assertive and accomplished.</p> <p>This is a union town and a Democratic city, with <a href=\"http://www.goerie.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080930/NEWS02/309309939/-1/ELECTION&amp;template=election\">registered Democrats outnumbering Republicans</a>, 99,500 to 62,000. But it's an aging blue-collar town with a high percentage of Catholics, the kind of place Barak Obama struggled with during the primaries. Senator Hillary Clinton won <a href=\"http://www.eriecountyelections.com/assets/results_chart_erie.pdf\">62% of Erie's vote</a> during the Pennsylvania primary.</p> <p>My experience knocking on doors makes it obvious this is the kind of town that should go for Obama in a big way. The main issues? Health care, the economy and the war. In short, they're alarmed by rising health care costs, jobs going overseas, and angry with the Bush administration for tricking us into Iraq. A lot of them depend on disability, Medicare and social security. A lot of them shake their heads over the bail-out. They don't like McCain's talk of lower corporate taxes, his health care plan and his eagerness to take on Iran and Spain. But there are undecided voters abound. And <a href=\"http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/PAFieldOffices/\">Erie's Obama headquarters</a> have few regular volunteers from Erie itself. Instead to make the door and phone quotas, volunteers drive in on the weekends from New York, Ohio and Pittsburgh. </p> <p>That's not to say that Erie lacks supporters for Obama. Far from it. Yard signs proliferate. On the phone, the union men are angry with Republicans and fired up to put an ally in the White House. At the doors, Obama supporters greet his canvassers with excitement, perhaps even relief. Still, there's a palpable resistance, especially on the lower west side in the middle-class white neighbourhoods where I spend my Sundays knocking on doors.</p> <p>\"He doesn't inspire me,\" said one woman, puttering around her yard in the waning days of summer. \"I haven't really gone for a candidate in a long time.\" Who was the last candidate that inspired you? She stopped and mulled this over. \"JFK,\" she said. But what separates the two men, really? Isn't Obama the JFK of the upcoming generation? The answer hangs between us, unspoken.</p> <p>Another woman, an undecided voter in a Steelers jersey, admits that it's the name that keeps her from opting for Obama. \"I mean, 'Obama,'\" she says. \"It's a lot like, 'Osama,' you know?\" I patiently explained Obama's personal history, mentioned that he was brought up by his white grandparents in Hawaii and spent time in Chicago working as a community organiser in neighborhoods struggling with steel plant closings. She smiled, a brilliant flash of white and freckled cheeks, and two golden retrievers came barreling out the door with tails wagging. A child runs around the corner. \"I'm sorry, mom,\" the child said, \"they got away from me\".</p> <p>Another man, visibly angry about the bail-out explained his reluctance to commit to Obama this way: \"I wish he would talk like one of us,\" he said. He wanted Obama to talk tougher. He's so ... so ... \"Eloquent?\" I offered. \"Uppity,\" said the man.</p> <p>It's not exactly racism \u2013 at least, not the virulent kind expressed by the Ron Paul supporter in Pittsburgh \u2013 but it's not exactly not racism, either. It's a kind of unspoken uneasiness with Obama's \"otherness\". It's his name, his skin color and his background - all of which have been distorted and exaggerated in email chains, on conservative radio talk shows, and, lately, fanned by the McCain campaign.</p> <p>Is this the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_effect\">\"Bradley effect\"</a> in action? You know, the theory that there's a discrepancy between opinion polls and election results for black candidates, because people are less likely to admit their prejudice to a pollster than act on them in the privacy of a voting both? Not likely: for one, it seems the days of the Bradley effect <a href=\"http://people.iq.harvard.edu/~dhopkins/wilder13.pdf \">are long-gone</a> (pdf). For another, conservative rhetoric has armed voters with the vocabulary to express prejudice to pollsters without using racist language. \"Uppity,\" \"risky,\" worries about his \"background,\" are all coded language expressing uneasiness with the Democratic candidate, and reflect a level scrutiny that McCain is largely free from.</p> <p>Instead, it seems likely that this disquiet at many doors in Erie, and reluctance to eagerly support the Democratic candidate may be the result of a \"partially negative view of blacks\" that a recent <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/22/race.politics/\">CNN/Yahoo study on race</a> in the 2008 election identified in whites, and a view that may alter the outcome of the election by at much as 6 points in McCain's favor. Again, it isn't out-and-out racism; it's subtler and more malleable, easier to dislodge.</p> <p>That's the premise of this week's <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/current\">Time Magazine</a>, which examines race in context of this year's election. In its story, <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1848769,00.html\">\"Race and Brain\"</a>, science provides hope that race can be overcome. It's simple, really. \"The more you think about people as individuals,\" cognitive neuroscientist Liz Phelps was quoted as saying, \"the more the brain calms down.\" Go to the doors, and tell people about Barack Obama's story. Keep going back until either they get it, or they associate Obama with you.</p> <p>And certainly Time's cover story, arguing that the sagging economy is <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1848469,00.html\">pushing race prejudice to the side</a>, rings true here in Erie. On my last jaunt through Erie just yesterday and among undecided and \"sporadic\" voters, the reaction was positive toward Obama and all about the economy. </p> <p>Yes, a teenage girl shouted at us as we passed by, \"I wouldn't vote for him; he sounds like a terrorist!\" But consider this: we recognised the two boys sitting with her. They had come down to Obama's Erie campaign office to volunteer.</p>",

  "<p>Jibril Rajoub doesn't look like a man you'd want to mess with. His large, imposing frame and bullet-like bald head make the new president of the Palestinian Football Association resemble an ageing prizefighter, which in some ways he is. Whilst most football administrators cut their teeth in bureaucratic hell, Rajoub has a far more colourful and controversial past.</p> <p>By the age of 17 he had been sentenced to life in jail for throwing a grenade at Israeli troops. At 33 he was exiled to Lebanon and by the time of the second intifada he had risen through the Fatah ranks to become Yasser Arafat's trusted national security adviser, building a reputation as the West Bank's internal 'hard man' while also being known as a political moderate opposed to attacks on Israeli soil. Yet for the past six months Rajoub has been involved in one of the hardest scraps of his life: trying to bring international football to Palestine for the first time.</p> <p>This weekend was a momentous occasion for the Palestinians after it was announced that, finally, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/25/palestine-jordan-football-match\" title=\"\">the national team would be allowed to play a home game in the West Bank</a>, a remarkable feat almost entirely attributable to Rajoub, who has had to overcome more than a decade of failure, exile and broken dreams. Yet when Fifa tentatively recognised Palestine in the mid 1990s, it was a cause for massive celebration in the West Bank and Gaza. Fifa was, after all, one of the only international bodies to recognise Palestine's existence.</p> <p>Games couldn't be played at home, Fifa deemed it too dangerous, but there was no shortage of Arab capitals willing to show Palestinian solidarity, and Amman and Doha became their new home as the team launched a bid to reach the World Cup finals. Qualification, the Palestinians reasoned, would be a damn sight more effective for the cause of national self-determination than almost anything else. By 2004 they were ready for a crack at the 2006 finals in Germany.</p> <p>It started well for them too. Fifa had relaxed rules on citizenship meaning that the Palestinians could call on their massive Diaspora to fill the team sheet. Adverts were put into magazines in Germany, Chile and the United States to attract players. A multinational squad was assembled, followed by an 8-0 thumping of Chinese Taipei and then a respectable 1-1 draw with Iraq. Then the wheels fell off. </p> <p>Movement restrictions between Gaza and the West Bank, not to mention the restrictions within them, meant the team could rarely train together. Training camps were set up in Egypt, but the players from Gaza would rarely get through Israeli checkpoints. The coaching staff, realising that nine-man training sessions probably weren't great preparation for a World Cup qualifier, started picking more players from the West Bank, breeding resentment amongst the two groups of players and effectively creating two different national teams.</p> <p>The nail in the coffin came when the team was denied permission to leave Palestine to play Uzbekistan. The Palestinians, without their Gaza contingent, could only scrape together 10 players. It was a miracle they lost only 3-0. The campaign was over, the Palestinian dream of statehood through the back door shattered.</p> <p>Palestinian football went into decline. The West Bank's football league was suspended as it was almost impossible to fulfil any fixtures when there were so many checkpoints to negotiate. If the fans managed to get to the game, it was unlikely that one of the teams, or sometimes even the referee, would make it. </p> <p>The Gaza league, though, continued unmolested, one of the few areas other than tunnel construction to benefit from Israel's unilateral pull-out from the strip. The team's efforts to reach the 2010 World Cup finals also ended on the desk of an Israeli bureaucrat. They were eventually eliminated when the team couldn't get visas for a qualifier against Singapore last October.</p> <p>The FA pleaded that movement restrictions had again stopped the players from travelling, but its objections fell on deaf ears and Fifa awarded the match 3-0 to Singapore. Then Rajoub came riding to the rescue in May, driven by his trademark ruthlessness and a single-minded objective of giving Palestine home advantage for the first time in its history.</p> <p>\"From the first moment I was elected as president I started organising to have a match here between our first national team with any team that would play us,\" he explains as multiple phones go off around him. \"In my first meeting with [Fifa president] Sepp Blatter in May, I asked him and the process began. He said OK and would sponsor such a match and then the deputy president [of the FA] of Jordan approached us. </p> <p>\"But to be fair many, many teams approached us to be the first team to play in Palestine but our brothers in Jordan insisted and they deserve to be the first one to play the match because they have helped us so much and contributed to where we are today.\"</p> <p>It's apt that Jordan were the first team to play in Palestine, and not just because Amman became a temporary home for the team. It is estimated that up to 80% of Jordanians are of Palestinian descent, and a number of the players from the national team trace their origins back to the West Bank and what is now modern day Israel. </p> <p>Even Jordan's most popular team, current champions Wihdat, have a strong Palestinian identity. The owner is a Palestinian-born Christian MP in the Jordanian parliament and the club are based in the Palestinian Wihdat refugee camp in Amman. The fan's most popular chant is \"Allah, Wihdat, Al Quds Arabi\" (God, Wihat, Jerusalem [for the] Arabs).</p> <p>Yet it was touch and go whether the match would take place at all. As you'd expect in a part of the world where politics seeps into every action, organising the game had become something of a logistical nightmare. To start with the West Bank has very few grass pitches, let alone stadiums, so a new home for Palestinian football needed to be found. </p> <p>Rajoub began by travelling to Israel and meeting with sympathetic Knesset members to build support for a new national stadium, built next to the Green Line on the edge of East Jerusalem in Al Ram, a stone's throw from the separation barrier that divides the landscape.</p> <p>Palestinian Authority policemen were not allowed to patrol the area so a special deal had to be struck with the Israelis to allow them to police the stadium. Then there was the slew of dignitaries to be taken care of. Blatter was in town to admire his handiwork: it was money from Fifa's Goal project that paid for the stadium's completion. But the main problems giving Rajoub headaches were the same problems that have afflicted all of his predecessors: getting the players to the games.</p> <p>As the national team is split in two, travel permission had to be sought from the Israelis. Six players from Gaza were denied permission to travel to the game, including the team's captain, Saed Jundiyah, who the Israeli's deemed a \"security risk\". </p> <p>The last time I met him, at a football tournament in Jordan last summer, he had the opposite problem: he was stuck in Jordan, denied permission to get back into Gaza. But most worryingly for Rajoub, the Jordanian national team had been detained at the Allenby Bridge crossing between Jordan and the West Bank.</p> <p>While most would buckle under the pressure, Rajoub knows a thing or two about operating under tough conditions. \"Listen, you know my background: I am a Palestinian fighter. Wherever I go I make order and I make action plans,\" he said 48 hours before the match, as his staff made frantic phone calls to try to ease the Jordanians' passage. </p> <p>\"I define what I want and make sure the means are there to assure my ends and my goals. This is what I got as chief of security, national security adviser, and when I was in the underground resistance. I've used the experience of my past and my contacts to ensure we've got what we wanted.\"</p> <p>It was for these qualities that Rajoub secured his almost unanimous election as head of the Palestinian FA, in itself an interesting move given his past and the continuing enmity between Hamas and Fatah factions. He is one of Fatah's most important operators and was even spoken of as a potential president after Yasser Arafat's death. But Islamic Jihad and Hamas have criticised him in the past for instigating occasional purges to halt attacks against Israeli targets.</p> <p>\"There were some concerns,\" Rajoub admitted. \"But I was elected by all the political factions, extreme right, extreme left, PFLP [the left-wing Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine], Palestine Democratic Union, everyone. I am proud of that and I think football should not be used to divide and should present all the Palestinian people as one. There is no political affiliation in the team, it is a national issue.\"</p> <p>His stock has risen to such a level that reports earlier this month suggested that he had travelled to Gaza for secret security talks with deposed Hamas prime minister Ismail Haniya. Whether this footballing d\u00e9tente between the two factions spreads to other areas is another issue entirely. </p> <p>Just east over the separation barrier, a little over an hour's drive to the coast, is the Ramat Gan Stadium in Tel Aviv, the home of Israeli football. Palestine might look to Asia, and Israel Europe, but could the two teams ever play each other in Jerusalem in a peace match, I ask. Rajoub is cautious.</p> <p>\"First of all on the national level we are playing an active role to bridge the internal gap between the competing [Hamas and Fatah] factions and I think we are making a success of this but it's up to the Israel,\" he said. \"Do they want peace, security, settlements, checkpoints or occupation? </p> <p>\"The core message we want to give the international community is values, competition without violence and bloodshed. It is up to the Israelis to decide. We cannot co-operate on the one hand and then, on the other, live under restrictions and internal arrest.\"</p> <p>Yet you get the feeling that, with Rajoub at the helm, anything is now possible. He has already achieved more for Palestinian football, and Palestinian national unity, than almost anyone else in the past few years. </p> <p>\"I have a strategy for the next four years [but] I am using all my effort, all my power just to get through the next 48 hours, let me cross this bridge first,\" he explained, no pun intended. \"The Israelis are still preventing the Jordanian national team from crossing over. It's Friday. The match is Sunday so the challenge is very huge. See what can go wrong? Let's see if we make it through the next 48 hours my friend, and then I'll concentrate on what come next.\"</p> <p>And he did make it through. In the end the last-minute diplomacy worked. The Israelis let the Jordanian team through and a packed Faisal al Husseini Stadium reverberated to chants of \"Football is more noble than war\" as Palestine took an early lead, only to be pegged back. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/video/2008/oct/27/palestine-jordan-football\" title=\"\">It finished 1-1</a>, a good result against a team 68 places above them in the Fifa rankings. But, as it always is for Palestine, the result didn't really matter. Walking out on to home turf was victory enough.</p> <p><em>When Friday Comes: Football in the War Zone (Mainstream) by James Montague is out now</em></p>",
  "<p>Jean Charles de Menezes was identified as \"definitely our man\", one of the police marksmen who shot the Brazilian told an inquest today.</p> <p>Using the codename C2, the trained firearms officer told the inquest at the Oval cricket ground that he shot the 27-year-old electrician after hearing a surveillance officer positively identify the suspect as the failed suicide bomber Hussain Osman.</p> <p>But he also admitted that he could have stopped the innocent Brazilian before he entered Stockwell underground station, if he had been ordered to do so. De Menezes was shot seven times as he boarded a tube at the station.</p> <p>The marksman, who was giving evidence in open court for the first time, said that he feared for his life during the chase that led to De Menezes's death.</p> <p>C2 recalled how after De Menezes boarded a bus towards Stockwell, south London, a surveillance officer identified him as Osman over police radios.</p> <p>\"I heard over the radio that there was a surveillance officer on the bus and I heard them say 'this was definitely our man',\" he told the jury.</p> <p>C2 shot the Brazilian after his colleague C12 opened fire.</p> <p>When asked what else he heard as he pursued the bus in a silver Mercedes with two other firearms officers, C2 said: \"I heard over the radio that he was nervous, acting strangely and that he was standing up in the stairs acting very twitchy.\"</p> <p>He added that in his 17 years as a specialist firearms officer, the incident on July 22 2005 - the day after a failed second bomb attempt on London's public transport - was the greatest threat he had faced.</p> <p>\"I have been in the firearms unit for a number of years and we have never faced a threat like that,\" C2 said.</p> <p>\"It did occur to me that I might not get home if it all went wrong.\"</p> <p>Before the confrontation on the tube, C2 said he never heard the instruction to go to \"state red\", meaning the firearms teams should intervene to detain the suspect.</p> <p>Michael Mansfield QC, for the De Menezes family, asked him: \"If you had been given state red at the lights at the time before he had even got off the bus, you could have been across the road and stopping him entering the tube station, couldn't you?\"</p> <p>C2 replied: \"Yes sir, absolutely.\"</p> <p>The lawyer went on: \"And you were well-equipped to deal with an intervention of that kind, weren't you?\"</p> <p>The officer said: \"Yes sir, I was.\" </p> <p>C2, a member of Scotland Yard's elite CO19 specialist firearms unit, told how, like C12, he was carrying a Glock pistol with a detachable torch and 124 grain ammunition, designed to \"immediately incapacitate\".</p> <p>Yesterday C12 was accused of \"grossly exaggerating\" his evidence to justify his decision to open fire.</p> <p>The firearms officer insisted he shouted \"armed police\" before shooting him dead - despite other witnesses not claiming to have heard any warning.</p> <p>C2 was today questioned about the events from entering Stockwell station that led to the shooting.<br> Nicholas Hilliard QC, counsel to the inquest, asked him: \"Did you believe at this time then that he had a bomb with him?\"</p> <p>The officer replied: \"I didn't know whether he had or he hadn't, but I believe that was certainly a distinct possibility.\"</p> <p>C2 was directed by surveillance officers on to the tube train where the suspected bomber was sitting. He said he did not issue a warning immediately because he feared the Brazilian was a potential suicide bomber.</p> <p>\"If I shouted 'armed police' too early then he would be alerted to our presence, possibly he could initiate a device,\" he said.</p> <p>The firearms officer paused before describing the shooting of De Menezes, to offer his condolences to the Brazilian's family.</p> <p>He said: \"Can I take this opportunity to acknowledge the family, because I am very well aware of what I am about to describe.\"</p> <p>The marksman went on to describe how he did not remember hearing any shots before he opened fire.</p> <p>He said his gun jammed as he unloaded six shots at the electrician.</p> <p>He also said he only shouted \"armed police\" after deciding to shoot.</p> <p>Mr Hilliard asked: \"Can you explain why you fired six shots?\"</p> <p>C2 replied: \"At the time I fired I believed that I, and everyone else, was about to die.\"</p> <p>He told how he ran forward to get a closer shot, adding: \"I ran forward, I reached over the top of the surveillance officer and I pushed him down.</p> <p>\"I shouted 'armed police' and I held my handgun to the head of the subject and I fired.</p> <p>\"I was this close because I did not want to shoot the surveillance officer and there were other civilians on the carriage. I just could not afford to miss.\"</p> <p>When asked why he shouted a warning so late, he replied: \"I realised it was late but I realised there were members of the public and they should know it was police officers.\"</p> <p>The inquest continues.</p>",

It does not permit somebody to be banned for simply holding disagreeable political views but will apply to those who advocate illegal means to further them.</p> <p>An MI5 report leaked to the Guardian this year on the current state of radicalisation and violent extremism in Britain noted that the influence of extremist clerics had \"moved into the background\" in recent years.</p>",
  "<p>The current financial crisis is the \"most severe in living memory\", the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank of England</a> said today. </p> <p>Sir John Gieve, deputy governor, said that despite moves to bail out banks both here and the US, there could be more turmoil to come. The financial health of insurance companies and hedge funds are among the areas of concern.</p> <p>\"The package of measures introduced in the UK and elsewhere has improved the prospects significantly, especially for banks but it is too soon to declare the crisis over,\" he said in a speech to the British Bankers' Association.</p> <p>\"Authorities worldwide need to remain vigilant and to be ready to step in again if necessary.\"<br> He said that everyone has new lessons to learn from the turmoil of the last 15 months. These include the need to establish a more effective regime in the UK for handling failing banks and the need to develop new \"macro-prudential\" policies to bridge the gap between monetary policy and the regulation of particular institutions and markets. He also added that there is a need to improve the handling of cross border crises and bank failures.</p> <p>Banks will also come under pressure to build up their reserves during good times, in order to protect themselves against losses in a downturn. This kind of \"dynamic provisioning\" has been used by banks in Spain, leaving institutions such as Santander, which has taken over Abbey, Alliance &amp; Leicester and part of Bradford &amp; Bingley, relatively well-placed. </p> <p>\"The effect is to build up reserves when loans are originated which can then be drawn down when the economy begins to deteriorate and actual losses are incurred. That would lessen the need to raise capital in downturns,\" he said.</p> <p>The Bank lopped 50 basis points off rates in an emergency meeting earlier this month to 4.5%. Several economists are expecting another half point cut next month.</p> <p>In its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/28/economics-credit-crunch-bank-england\">half-yearly health check of the City, the Bank said</a> that autumn's market mayhem has left the world's financial institutions nursing losses of $2.8tn.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/vietnam\">Vietnam</a> is considering a ban on small-chested people driving motorbikes - a proposal that has provoked widespread disbelief, all the more in this nation of slightly built people.</p> <p>The ministry of health recently recommended that people whose chests measure less than 28 inches (72cm) would be prohibited, as would those who are too short or too thin.</p> <p>The proposal is part of an exhaustive list of new criteria the ministry has come up with to ensure that Vietnam's drivers are in good health. As news of the plan hit the media this week, Vietnamese expressed incredulity.</p> <p>\"It's ridiculous,\" said Tran Thi Phuong, 38, a Hanoi insurance agent. \"It's absurd.\"</p> <p>\"The new proposals are very funny, but many Vietnamese people could become the victim of this joke,\" said Le Quang Minh, 31, a Hanoi stockbroker. \"Many Vietnamese women have small chests. I have many friends who won't meet these criteria.\"</p> <p>It was unclear how the ministry established its size guidelines, and an official there declined to comment.</p> <p>The average Vietnamese man is 1.64m (5ft 4in) tall and weighs 55kg (121lb). The average Vietnamese woman is 1.55m tall and weighs 47kg.</p> <p>Statistics on average chest size were unavailable.</p> <p>The draft, which must be approved by the central government to become law, would also prohibit people from driving motorbikes if they suffer from array of health conditions like enlarged livers or sinusitis. The rules would cover the vast majority of Vietnam's 20m motorbikes. It would not apply to car or truck drivers.</p> <p>Motorbikes account for more than 90% of the vehicles on Vietnam's roads, and many workers in the nation of 85 million need them to do their jobs.</p> <p>When Nguyen Van Tai, a motorbike taxi driver, heard about the proposal, he immediately had his chest measured. Much to his relief, Tai beat the chest limit by 7cm.</p> <p>\"A lot of people in my home village are small,\" said Tai, 46. \"Many in my generation were poor and suffered from malnutrition, and now the ministry of health wants to stop us from driving to work.\"</p> <p>Vietnamese bloggers have been poking fun at the plan, envisioning traffic police with tape measures eagerly pulling over female drivers to measure their chests.</p> <p>\"From now on, padded bras will be bestsellers,\" said Bo Cu Hung, a popular Ho Chi Minh City blogger.</p> <p>Newspapers were inundated with letters today from concerned readers who worried that they wouldn't measure up.</p> <p>\"I'm not heavy enough. What am I going to do?\" Le Thu Huong asked in a letter to the Tuoi Tre newspaper. \"And what about people whose chests are small? Most of them are too poor to afford breast implants!\"</p>",
  "<p>Does the name Abdelbaset Ali Mohamed al-Megrahi mean anything to you? If you live outside Scotland, probably not. Yet he was a central player \u2013 the central player? \u2013 in an event which shook us all to the core in the relative innocence of the pre-9/11 era. </p> <p>But even to step off the overnight Edinburgh sleeper is to be reminded of the different rhythms of Scottish public life. They were always there, but devolution of power from Westminster to Holyrood has made them more so. <br><br>What is the biggest controversy to arise from the global banking crisis in Scotland?</p> <p>Not inter-bank liquidity or bonuses paid to City low-fliers. It is whether or not the \"UK government\" \u2013 that remote entity, the \"government in London\" - is right to persist with the emergency merger between Lloyds TSB and HBOS now that it is buying into all stricken banks.</p> <p>Alex Salmond's SNP administration, eminent Scots bankers and much of the media are campaigning to unpick the deal \u2013 in Scotland's perceived interests.</p> <p>The fate of al-Megrahi is another event important to Scots but also to us all. The reputations of Scottish, and by extension British, justice are at stake (though they retain their different historic roots: Roman law and English common law).</p> <p>Have you remembered him yet? He is the former Libyan Airlines steward and intelligence officer convicted in 2001 of being responsible for the smuggled bomb that destroyed Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie on the night of December 21 1988. 270 people died.</p> <p>Why is he in the news again as well as being in Greenock prison on the lower Clyde? He has always denied his guilt, lost an appeal in March 2002, but has been <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/28_06_07_reviewlockerbie.pdf\">given leave by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission to appeal again</a>. Judges cited four possible grounds for suspecting a miscarriage of justice in the case.</p> <p>That appeal is due to be heard next spring. But doctors have now confirmed that al-Megrahi does not have until then. He has an advanced form of prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of his body. The medics say the 56-year-old Libyan may have only three months to live.</p> <p>So the issue is: should al-Megrahi be released early from his 27-year sentence and sent home to his family to die? The decision is Scotland's, more precisely that of the justice minister, Kenny MacAskill. But since people from many countries died over (and in) the small Borders town in 1988 the ramifications stretch wider.</p> <p>British victims' families, quoted in the Scotsman, which supports the campaign to let al-Megrahi go, tend towards compassion. One such is Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora perished in the bombing and who campaigned vocally for justice. Swire is clearly a man of quality who has expressed doubts about the safety of the conviction on neutral (Dutch) territory in 2000 \u2013 despite the 230 witnesses and \u00a375m cost.</p> <p>\"It would be a tragedy if he is to spend the rest of his life in a Scottish prison, particularly if he is not guilty,\" Swire told the newspaper. \"I don't feel vindictive towards him at all,\" says a mother who lost her son. American relatives quoted sound more vengeful, which may represent how Americans feel \u2013 and may not.</p> <p>Tam Dalyell, the former Labour MP and all-purpose troublemaker, has always believed the prosecutors in the Crown Office were less than frank about the quality of their witnesses in front of the three Scottish judges who tried the case. British and US intelligence services were under huge pressure to get someone.</p> <p>He is particularly alarmed about a man called Tony Gauci, the Maltese shopkeeper who identified the accused as buying key items. His probity was vouched for, but later <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article584098.ece\">a senior lawyer admitted he was \"not quite the full shilling\"</a>.</p> <p>What about the rest of us? If the families, not all of whom regard the conviction as doubtful, are prepared to let him go, why should we think otherwise? </p> <p>My only further thought from the period is that Colonel Gadafy's Libya in the 80s was a friendless whipping boy for US anger, impotence and frustration about the Arab world. It was the decade when Ronald Reagan had it bombed from UK bases for no convincing reason. (Margaret Thatcher agreed only because she felt she owed him one for help retaking the Falklands.) </p> <p>Syria, far guiltier of anti-American actions, as I recall, was treated more leniently for reasons of state, though no longer. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/oct/27/syria-usa\">As Simon Tisdall writes in today's Guardian the Bush administration has a genius for doing things that big up Iran</a>, including pushing Damascus into its embrace.</p> <p>It is all far from Greenock prison, where al-Megrahi is apparently dying. Over to you, Mr MacAskill.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/madonna\">Madonna</a> has always held a unique fascination for me: the myth, the legend, but not the truth. Who cares about Madonna \"the person\"? Her <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/oct/26/celebrity-madonna\">impending divorce</a> is only of interest in terms of how she packages it into the Madonna Myth.</p> <p>And what a myth! A dancer from Detroit, coming to New York City with $35 in her pocket, no contacts, and dropped by a taxi driver in Times Square after a request to be \"'where the action is\" to go on and dictate <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/popandrock\">popular culture</a> for the next 30 years? Madonna and Michael Jackson invented the Queen and King of Pop, and took the ideas of rock'n'roll myth-making into the pop world. </p> <p>In 1992, I met Jackson; he was playing an eight run show at the Tokyo Dome and I was there with Bobby Gillespie. Gillespie wanted to attend the shows and meet the man but was denied by Sony, who thought he was too uncontrollable and off his head on drugs (ironic considering that I was doing more drugs than Bob at the time). It was pure religious spectacle being in an arena with 50,000 Jackson fans in the midst of pop hysteria. After the show, I was taken to meet Jackson and it was like having an audience with the Pope. It was pure dada; you were taken behind a screen where you had your photograph taken with Jackson. </p> <p>However, I've never wanted to meet Madonna. Madonna the spectacle, yes. Madonna, the cultural provocateur, yes. Madonna, the producer, not creator, yes. Madonna, the person, no. It's almost as if she is incapable of being anything other than Madonna The Myth, something she has created. I love it. Who would want to meet Madonna when the myth has a more fantastic life of its own?</p> <p>You could blame the myth on the cab driver who dropped her off where the action was hot. In '77 NYC (the year of Punk, Disco and Madonna) there was an art revolution going on: Television, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/blondie\">Blondie</a>, Arthur Russell, Larry Levine's Paradise Garage, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/ramones\">Ramones</a>, disco, punk rock, club culture and, of course, the godfather of New York City, Andy Warhol. Warhol has held sway over her entire career. Madonna, like Warhol, is the ultimate observer of, rather than participant in, modern culture. She took Warhol's template of ambition and success being an art form and regenerated it into a pop career presented not only as art, but a mirror on society, reflecting our tastes and aspirations; whether it be the yuppie life of Material Girl to the pre-00 new age observations of Ray of Light. Her reinventions are a reflection of us, not her, as she has always lacked a 'grand purpose' or 'natural conclusion' of most rock'n'roll stories. </p> <p>Madonna is at her best when exploiting religion and sex to court controversy. The woman has been banned by countries! Countries! The woman used <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKMHtcZ7dAQ\">a black Jesus</a>, self inflicted stigmatas, and danced in a field of burning crosses in order to sell Pepsi! Total pop genius. Is Madonna even sexy? Madonna 'sexy' is parody and camp, yet she regularly presents herself as sex object and deviant to middle America and MTV. Dressed as a dominatrix, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLbsFdeuy80\">kissing Britney and Christine Aguilera</a>? Check. A 50-year-old in a leotard disco dancing in a dark club combating ageism in rock and doing it with style? Check. Cross-dressing and getting dangerously close to transvestism in Vogue? Check. It's sex for profit! It's sex as camp! It's sex as parody! </p> <p>In the early 90s, she took sex too far for even America. But she still knew how to turn controversy into profit, and when Justify my Love was banned by MTV, she publicised the ban and sold <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hmedQupKUI\">the video</a> separately. She somehow also found time to accidentally invent rock'n'roll reality television with her documentary <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RixnRnnIfs\">In Bed with Madonna</a>.</p> <p>After the Sex debacle, she reinvented herself as Madonna, the Serious Artist with Bedtime Stories (and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedtime_Story\">collaborations with Bjork</a>) and Ray of Light; consolidating it with the Mirwais-produced Music in 2000 (the only time I've got involved with Madonna is the chase for Mirwais, her producer - we wanted him for Creation Records, however she signed him up to Maverick). </p> <p>She went too far with American Life, though. Madonna tried to change the world and failed (Madonna could never be Jesus Christ - or John Lennon - with a message; after all her message for 30 years has been 'Hey, how hot is Jesus?'). Warhol never delivered a moral message and neither should Madonna; she went back to basics and the dancefloor with Confessions on a Dance Floor and Hard Candy.</p> <p>A friend sent me over a passage from Madonna's brother's tell-all biography My Life with Sister Madonna. She said it offers no real revelations and was trashy (with the rumour being Madonna approved it ... genius!), but the brother's statement \"I fear she no longer has any boundaries, any limits. Everyone and everything is grist for the publicity mill, fodder for her career - even our late mother\". The passage was supposed to be a damning indictment, but ending up being a succinct reading of Madonna's career. Madonna is post-modern art, the likes of which we will never see again.</p>",
  "<p>How quickly the golden hue of optimism fades into the familiar gloom of disappointment and failed expectations. How easily long-cherished dreams recede from touching distance to spots on the distant horizon. And with what indecent, impatient and juvenile haste are people judged in this age of instant gratification. Just ask Iain Dowie.</p> <p>When Dowie took over the reins at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr\" title=\"\">QPR</a> in May, it must have seemed like a dream job. A team on the up, drowning in cash, with owners whose track record in business and sport showed them to be shrewd, sensible and successful. And, at the top of the pyramid, the charismatic figure of Flavio Briatore, who brought with him not only cash and know-how, but a dash of elan - and the occasional supermodel. While he swanned about in spectacles with lilac lenses, the rest of us supporters were using ones with a rosier hue.</p> <p>How bloody naive.</p> <p>On Friday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/oct/25/qpr-championship\" title=\"\">Dowie was sacked by Briatore after 15 games in charge</a>. Fifteen games is nowhere near long enough to give someone a crack of the whip at the best of times, but the sheer, shattering, shambolic absurdity of this situation is that he'd actually done well in his time at the helm. Dowie oversaw eight wins in those 15 games. He <a href=\"http://touchline.onthespot.co.uk/guardian/StatsCentre.asp?CPID=82&amp;CTID=11&amp;Lang=0&amp;pStr=Comp_Table&amp;link=\" 3\"\" title=\"\">left Rangers in ninth place in the Championship</a>, one point off the play-off places, and in the last 16 of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/carlingcup\" title=\"\">Carling Cup</a>, having beaten a close-to-full-strength Aston Villa in the previous round.</p> <p>All right, some of the football was more utilitarian than aesthetic, and style was occasionally sacrificed on the altar of expedience, but so what? A manager's job is to get results. There are suggestions that Briatore, who has stated his desire to turn QPR into a boutique brand, wanted a more stylish type of football. Which raises the question: what the hell made him appoint Dowie in the first place?</p> <p>As a QPR fan, I was disappointed with Dowie's appointment. I felt his gilt-edged record at Palace had subsequently become tarnished by failures at Charlton and Coventry. But I knew what the club would be getting from him - a team that was fit, well-organised, defensively solid, hard-working, and perhaps a little lacking in creativity - somewhat in the image of its manager. It seems, though, that Briatore thought he was getting someone who combined Kevin Keegan's attacking philosophy with Walt Disney's ability to entertain. Where he got such an idea from, heaven only knows.</p> <p>But if I was underwhelmed by Dowie's appointment, I'm left speechless at his dismissal. Not just for the absurd haste of it, but for the reasons that appear to underpin it. It is said that Briatore wanted to exert an inappropriate measure of control over Dowie's decisions. Reports indicate that he and Dowie had a number of fallings out over the former's interference in footballing affairs.</p> <p>Right from the get-go, things didn't look good. After his appointment, Dowie announced to the press that they shouldn't read too much into his title as first-team coach - he would still control transfers and pick the team. Yet while he announced his intention to pursue players such as Ben Watson, Clinton Morrison and Jermaine Beckford, Briatore was arranging for the transfers or loan signings of Daniel Parejo, Emmanuel Ledesma and Samuel Di Carmine. Regardless of the merits of the players involved, the impression that the club was signing players in spite of rather than because of their manager, was hardly healthy. Look at Dennis Wise's role at Newcastle. Well, at QPR it looks like we've got the cocky mafia, who think they've earned the right to pick the team.</p> <p>That, by the way, is not an exaggeration. It has been reported that before the game against Reading, Dowie was presented with a team sheet, drawn up by Briatore, and told it was his starting XI. Dowie, not surprisingly, took exception to this. How would Briatore like it if Dowie started telling him how to run his Renault F1 team? (Interestingly, with a masters degree in mechanical engineering, perhaps that's exactly what Dowie should do.)</p> <p>Before he was fired, Dowie announced the team to play Reading. After his sacking, insiders say, caretaker manager Gareth Ainsworth made a \"couple of changes\". The nature of those changes is unknown, but the game saw Parejo regain his first team spot and Di Carmine was granted a rare start, at the expense of top-scorer Dexter Blackstock. Whether these changes were handed down to Ainsworth on another team sheet dispatched from on high is not confirmed, but this is what Ainsworth had to say on the matter: \"He's the chief investor and he loves taking an active part in how his investment is going.\" Right.</p> <p>While we're on the subject of reading between lines to find the none-too-hidden meaning, here's what experienced midfielder Gavin Mahon had to say on Dowie's tenure. \"The coaching was top drawer, well organised, everyone was fit and times we let him down on the pitch with our performances. His record's decent, you can't fault it \u2026 I think the club's moved on a lot from last year.\"</p> <p>So what of the dream job that Dowie took back in the halcyon days of summer? Suddenly it bears all the hallmarks of something distinctly toxic and chalice-shaped. Pre-season, QPR were laughably tipped as promotion favourites - a level of expectation that probably helped seal Dowie's doom. Mahon has also recently said he thinks Briatore wants promotion this season. This heaps pressure on any incoming manager, before taking into account that QPR have actually spent very little money to match the soaring expectations. And then there is the suggestion that, as manager, you don't get to make your own signings or even pick the team. What manager of any integrity would accept those terms? Certainly not any of those ambitious names so far mooted - from Darren Ferguson to Gary Johnson, and more exotically, the two Robertos, Mancini and Donadoni.</p> <p>Whoever he appoints, Briatore has a lot of ground to make up with QPR fans. Only a year ago, he was hailed as the saviour of the club. It says much for how he has conducted his business that his stock has fallen as sharply as the FTSE 100. Even before his role in Friday's bloodletting, he'd used up his credit. It turns out that making Loftus Road into a boutique stadium meant hoiking the prices to obscene levels, at a stroke disenfranchising many of those fans who had stayed loyal during the dark years of League One football and Vauxhall Motors defeats. Paying \u00a350-a-ticket is all well and good if you want the ground filled with moneyed Eurotrash parvenus, but it doesn't do much for the soul of a club.</p> <p>Some reports have suggested that Briatore would claw back some fans' kudos if he appointed Terry Venables as the new manager. The idea that such a move would be popular with the fans is beyond laughable. Thanks for the good times, Terry, but we've already got one permatanned playboy causing mayhem at our club, and that's one more than we need just now. The future's none too bright, but we could do without it being orange as well.</p>",
  "<p>One of football's greatest fallacies is that continuity is in itself a good thing. When Sam Allardyce left Newcastle after 24 matches, a host of pundits repeated the observation that Sir Alex Ferguson and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger had both been in their jobs for a long time and both had had success, and that therefore keeping your manager for a long time brings success.</p> <p>It is rather more likely that cause and effect are the other way round: those managers have not been successful because they've been at their clubs a long time; they've been at their clubs a long time because they've been successful. There is no sense in keeping on a failing manager in the vague hope that four years down the line he might scramble a couple of results in the Cup and off the back of it build a mighty empire.</p> <p>Still, some measure of stability is probably a good thing. Going through a manager every eight months cannot be helpful, but that is what <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/steauabucharest\" title=\"\">Steaua Bucharest</a> have averaged since Gigi Becali became majority shareholder in February 2003. When Dorinel Munteanu was appointed as Marius Lacatus's successor yesterday, he became the ninth manager Steaua have had since Becali took control, and the 12th since they became a plc in 1998 (two of those, Victor Piturca and Cosmin Olaroiu, have held the position twice).</p> <p>When Dennis Tueart was ousted from Manchester City's board during the Thaksin Shinawatra takeover, he observed that \"football these days has two time frames: short-term and very short-term\". Steaua would be delighted to have any sort of planning that stretches beyond instantaneous.</p> <p>Lacatus resigned after last Tuesday's 5-3 defeat to Lyon in the Champions League, a game which brought a spectacularly unconvincing vote of confidence from Becali. \"I promised I'd never sack him,\" he said, \"and I'll keep my word. I'll leave him alone until he drowns.\"</p> <p>Lacatus took the hint. \"I have decided to quit,\" he said. \"It was a good year, but obviously it could have been better. Unfortunately, I could not bring out better performances. Anyway, it's been an experience and maybe I will learn from the mistakes I made. I am leaving, because I don't see things getting better. It's better for me to leave than for the players to suffer and be under extra pressure.\"</p> <p>Which is all very noble, although it begs the question of where that extra pressure is coming from, and the answer is pretty simple. Romanian coaches in general tend to look on the life-span of a mayfly with a certain awed longing, but even by the standards of Romanian owners, Becali is more trigger-happy than most.</p> <p>If he weren't so unsavoury, he would make a fine pantomime villain. He has a certain charisma and it would be easy to regard him as a Richard III-style charmer had he not been awarded the Romanian LGBT community's Black Ball in 2006 for Homophobe of the Year. When he found out Freddie Mercury was gay, Becali banned the playing of Queen songs at the Ghencea.</p> <p>He has stood for election - and been humiliatingly defeated - on a hard-line Christian-nationalist ticket, and regularly invokes \"God\" - whom, he claimed after yet another controversial decision went Steaua's way earlier this year, doesn't recognise offside. He has made inflammatory remarks about Romania's ethnic Hungarian community, threatened various journalists with violence, and admitted that he began throwing chairs around a casino, smashing windows, after heavy losses earlier this year. He is, in short, a deeply unpleasant man.</p> <p>But Becali is also bad for Steaua, and not just because he was arrested in May carrying a suitcase full of money, which led to all kinds of awkward questions (Steaua were initially docked seven points on bribery charges, but were later cleared of any wrongdoing). That they have qualified for the group stages of the Champions League three times in succession is not the triumph it may appear, for they have won only one of their last 15 matches at that stage of the competition. The revenues generated by those appearances should have strengthened their domestic hegemony, even with the emergence of CFR Cluj as a serious force, but Steaua have gone two seasons without a title, and lie only fourth this year, six points behind the leaders Dinamo.</p> <p>Perhaps you could blame Lacatus, perhaps you could blame Massimo Pedrazzini and Gheorghe Hagi and Olaroiu and Oleh Protasov, and every other sap Becali has appointed. Or perhaps you could blame the man who never lets them get on with the job. When he left the club last September, Hagi said he was \"tortured second by second\" and \"humiliated\" by Becali's constant interference. \"Nobody will ever achieve anything at Steaua with Becali breathing down his neck,\" he went on. \"He destroys all smiling. He says he loves God, but God never said you could insult people in this way. Players are nothing to him, and he is destroying everything we are trying to do.\"</p> <p>Things haven't changed, and it doesn't look like they are going to. \"I will intervene if Steaua have problems,\" Becali said. \"If he [Munteanu] gets results, he'll stay. If not, I'll fire him immediately.\" Given Munteanu quit CFR Cluj over interference from the board, and walked out of Vaslui amid widespread allegations - all denied by Becali - that certain of his players had thrown a game against Steaua, it is hard to know what the attraction is, and even harder to see him lasting out the season.</p> <p>That ban on Queen is looking increasingly academic: unless some semblance of stability returns, Steaua are unlikely to be needing that \"We are the champions\" CD any time soon.</p>",
  "<p>Given that Christopher Nolan has just been responsible for the <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/boxoffice/alltimegross?region=world-wide\">fourth highest-grossing film of all time</a>, you might think he'd be keen to sign up for a sequel. But the British director has been stalling on a follow-up to the $991m-grossing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/122806/dark.knight\">The Dark Knight</a>, despite executives at Warner Bros reportedly falling over backwards to persuade him to take it on. Going by his <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2008/10/christopher-nol.html\">comments to the LA Times yesterday</a>, one of his first interviews since the film's overwhelming success, that procrastination shows no sign of letting up.</p> <p>Asked if he would be putting pen to paper for a third Batman film, Nolan had the following to say: \"Well ... let me think how to put this,\" he said. \"There are two things to be said. One is the emphasis on story. What's the story? Is there a story that's going to keep me emotionally invested for the couple of years that it will take to make another one? That's the overriding question. </p> <p>\"On a more superficial level, I have to ask the question: how many good third movies in a franchise can people name? At the same time, in taking on the second one, we had the challenge of trying to make a great second movie, and there haven't been too many of those either. It's all about the story really. If the story is there, everything is possible. I hope that was a suitably slippery answer.\"</p> <p>Nolan then continued to offer further comment on the possibility of a new movie without ever tying himself down to, well, anything.</p> <p>\"On one hand, yeah, there is a certain feeling to do [something smaller],\" he said. \"After Batman Begins, I certainly felt like taking on something smaller, but one of the things I got such a thrill from on The Dark Knight was shooting on Imax and creating that massive scale and achieving that larger-than-life quality. So that's a lot of fun. I'm drawn in both directions now. So maybe what I need to do next is a very intimate, small story that happens to be photographed on a ridiculously large scale. Or vice versa [laughs].\"</p> <p>It's only been a few months since The Dark Knight's release; yet, at this rate it looks like being several years before any new film even enters production. In the meantime, fans of the caped crusader are faced with the prospect that even George Miller's long-gestating Justice League movie, which will unite a non-Christian Bale Batman with Superman and Wonder Woman, could hit the big screen before any future Nolan effort. And that's enough to get anyone in a flap.</p>",
  "<p>I am of course delighted that the alleged plot to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/27/uselections2008-barackobama-neo-nazi-plot \">murder Barack Obama</a> and over 100 other African-Americans has been foiled. And yet, deep down, I can't help thinking that at least it shows someone's taking this election seriously. For all the hype and fluff and trivia about retired Weathermen and who can see Russia from her house, there's a vague sense that November 2008 really matters: the vague concept of \"change\" that brought Obama to prominence has become something tangible. For many, it is a sign of hope in dark times; the fact that it provokes a few others into planning acts of violence is further evidence of its potency.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, there are others who care. Well, a bit. Maybe. Confronted with provocative comments by immigration minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/feedarticle/7921699\">Phil Woolas</a>, a representative of the Manchester No Borders group threw a pie at him.</p> <p>Now, I'm all for acts of political street theatre; and pie throwing has an honorable tradition in the annals of counter culture, pricking pomposity and lightening the beige predictability of so much conventional debate. Legendary entarteurs such as <a href=\"http://www.whisperedmedia.org/Godin.html\">No\u00ebl Godin</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mcgilltribune.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticle&amp;ustory_id=efc8727d-44b1-44e7-9a5c-232c82f025f4\">Fran\u00e7ois Gourd</a> have kept the traditions of Situationism and Dada alive with their spontaneous patisserie politics.</p> <p>But pie throwers and their ilk usually aren't partisan; their ire is directed at politicians as a breed. Woolas was notionally pied because of what he said about immigration, but there's no evidence that his opposite number in the Conservative party would do anything different. Entartement is a sigh of impotent exasperation at society itself, as one set of self-important white men in suits replaces another; the least we can do is send them to the dry cleaners.</p> <p>Obama's wannabe killers, by contrast, wanted to take him out because of who and what he was, just as Booth shot Lincoln because he'd humiliated the Confederacy. And any British prime minister lives under permanent threat from the likes of al-Qaida; it happens on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/spooks/index.shtml\">Spooks</a>, so it must be true. </p> <p>The fact remains, though, that only one British PM, the otherwise anonymous <a href=\"http://www.victorianweb.org/history/pms/perceval.html\">Spencer Perceval</a> in 1812, has faced the ultimate backlash; four presidents have eaten lead since then, and several others (notably Ronald Reagan) have come perilously close. Conventional explanations for this tend to focus on American gun culture and Wild West mentality. I suspect it's more about differing responses to the political process; Americans may loathe their elected representatives, but they'll loathe them sincerely and without irony. The British just shrug, and head for the cake shop.</p>",
  "<h2>The European western</h2> <p>During the 1960s, the Italian film industry re-invented the American western. The genre was attractive for a variety of reasons. </p> <p>For many Europeans, the western was widely acknowledged as a quintessentially American form of film storytelling. The pared-down circumstances of the American west allowed for an operatic intensity of drama. </p> <p>Plus, the films were alluring to producers because of their relative economy. These movies became identified, because of their Italian origins, as spaghetti westerns.</p> <h2>Spaghetti in the desert</h2> <p>Italian film-makers drew on their familiarity with the genre to re-cast the western in a more cynical light than their American contemporaries. Film-makers in America had generally mythologised the west in terms of the harsh moral certainties of biblical teaching. American films were shot against the conveniently close backdrop of Monument Valley and the Arizona dessert.</p> <p>The ironic re-invention of the genre became a global phenomenon through the success of Sergio Leone's \"Dollars\" trilogy. Clint Eastwood was cast as the man-with-no-name bounty hunter, Blondie, and launched toward global superstardom.</p> <h2>Sergio Leone</h2> <p>The success of these films encouraged the producers to give the director, Sergio Leone, carte blanche for his next project. That project became Once Upon a Time in the West (1968). In the beginning, the script was fleshed out by Leone, Dario Argento and Bernardo Bertolucci - whose collaboration &lt;produced a story with a conceptual and philosophical sophistication unusual for cinema. </p> <h2>Marx in the west</h2> <p>The story of Once Upon a Time is set against the land-grab associated with the building of the trans-continental railway. So the drama is played out against a background of money and technology that provides a determining force for the characters' actions. The foregrounding of these powerful themes lends the film a historical, sociological and psychological realism. </p> <p>In the 1960s, the critical understanding of human behaviour was advanced through the development of social-science methodologies. The revelation, in detail, of the complex workings of modern society was generally understood as informed by Marxist theory and the pop culture sensibility of the Frankfurt School intellectuals. So, the film provides a watershed by acknowledging and foregrounding the complexity of the systems that determine our behaviour. </p> <h2>The poster</h2> <p>This poster for Once Upon a Time in the West is unusual to both British and American eyes. The narrow vertical format suggests that it was printed, as a stock-poster, for display in the doors of the local bars surrounding the cinema. This form of local display is quite usual in France and Italy and has resulted in a particular, and quite specific, form of poster. The addition of a coloured paper sticker with the exact date and time of the presentation would finish off the display. The coloured paper stickers were usually printed locally in letterpress.</p> <p>The simplification of the design into two, related, elements is daring. The poster comprises the title of the film in a playbill form of typeface. In addition there is a pictorial element derived from the opening gun battle sequence. The figure is conspicuous for his distinctive duster style coat. Let's look at these things in detail.</p> <h2>Bar-room playbills and thrifty typefaces</h2> <p>The playbill typeface was designed in the 19th century as a display type for the semi-literate communities of the American west. Display types were first originated in the 18th century as part of a growing demand for large sized typefaces that could be read, or at least recognised, from a distance. Typically, these letterforms were used on shop fronts and in letterpress poster design. So, they are entirely associated, in historical terms, with the emergence of organised commercial entertainments. This playbill typeface has a compressed form that, allowing more letters per line, is implicitly associated with the solid western value of thrift.</p> <p>Display types are immediately recognisable. In order to catch the eye, they use exaggerations of scale, form and perspective. The solid black printing associated with these letters is a historical reference to the ancient black-letter typefaces of early wood-block printing. The solid and exaggerated black serifs produce a distinctive optical dazzle and visual punch. This pattern can be recognised and, by association, linked to the various entertainments. </p> <p>For many people these letters, spelling out saloon or the names on a wanted poster for example, are an immediate and powerful reference to the Wild West.</p> <h2>Duster coats</h2> <p>The duster was a long, loose coat made of canvas or linen. It was designed to be worn by horsemen and to fit over their normal clothing and to protect it from trail dust. For practical purposes the coat had an exaggerated vent that allowed the coat to be worn comfortably whilst riding. On foot, the coats had a particular flapping gait. In addition the long, loose, coats allowed a variety of guns and weapons to be concealed. Just like the poncho, the coats allowed for the ready and speedy use of firearms. So the flapping duster was associated in the popular imagination, and from its very beginning, with violent and itinerant groups of horsemen. </p> <p>These specific associations help explain why the duster was rarely seen in the traditional western. The hero, individually isolated, could ride long distances without requiring special clothing except in the most difficult circumstances. Furthermore, the moral integrity of the hero would be fatally compromised by the use of a coat to hide a gun. Lastly, the action of most westerns is played out against the civilised backdrop of town and community. Even the saloon bar setting of many westerns required the protagonists to fight it out in their Sunday best.</p> <h2>The fight scene</h2> <p>The poster image comes from the railway station shoot-out that provides the climax of the long opening, and credit, sequence of the film. Three men, wearing trademark dusters, await the train and form an intimidating welcoming committee. After a long wait, the train arrives. The men are surprised when no one appears. It is only as the train departs that they become aware of the visitor. After some discussion, a gunfight takes place and the newcomer rides away. The sequence is constructed as a reference to the station scene in High Noon.</p> <h2>The railways</h2> <p>The duster coats are recognised as belonging to a local gang. In fact the agents of railway speculator, Morton, wear the coats as a form of disguise. The ruthlessness of Morton is based on a number of personalities associated with the American railway boom and its associated frauds, scandals and mayhem. The underhand and double-dealing of the railway speculator provides the framework for a film about violent duplicity and revenge. </p> <p>This is my all-time favourite film. I've watched it many times and I'm still amazed by it. It's big and clever and beautiful. The poster's great too.</p>",
  "<p>US police claim to have foiled an alleged plot by two skinhead neo-Nazis to assassinate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> as the culmination of a murder spree targeting black people.</p> <p>According to federal authorities, Daniel Cowart, 20, and Paul Schlesselman, 18, who were arrested in Tennessee on Wednesday, planned to attack an unidentified high school where most pupils were African-American. They intended to shoot 88 people and behead 14 others, before trying to shoot Obama.</p> <p>According to court records released last night, the pair planned to wear white tuxedos and top hats during the killings. </p> <p>They have been charged with making threats against a presidential candidate, conspiring to rob a gun store and possessing an unregistered firearm.</p> <p>While Cowart and Schlesselman did not appear to have made any concrete plans as to how they would target the Democratic presidential hopeful, law enforcement authorities said they had taken the threat very seriously. They said the pair appeared to be acting alone.</p> <p>\"They said that would be their last, final act \u2013 they would attempt to kill Senator Obama,\" said Jim Cavanaugh from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco Firearms and Explosives in Nashville, Tennessee. \"They didn't believe they would be able to do it, but that they would get killed trying.</p> <p>\"They seemed determined to do it. Even if they were just to try it, it would be a trail of tears around the south.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the Secret Service, which has been assigned to protect Obama since May 2007, said there did not appear to be any definite assassination plan.</p> <p>\"Whether or not they had the capability or the wherewithal to carry out an attack remains to be seen,\" said Eric Zahren. \"We don't discount anything.\"</p> <p>Obama downplayed the threat today, praising the skills of the officers protecting him and saying he believes voters prioritise qualifications over skin colour.</p> <p>\"I think what has been striking in this campaign is the the degree to which these kind of hate groups have been marginalized,\" he told a local Pennsylvania TV station. \"That's not who America is. That's not who our future is.\"</p> <p>When Cowart and Schlesselman were arrested, agents seized a rifle, a sawn-off shotgun and three pistols. Authorities believe they were preparing to break into a gun shop to steal more weapons.</p> <p>The court documents say the pair, from Arkansas and Tennessee, met about a month ago on the internet due to a shared interest in skinhead and white supremacist philosophies.</p> <p>The numbers involved in the murder plan, 88 and 14, are believed to be coded references to Adolf Hitler and David Lane, a white supremacist who died in prison last year. H is the eighth letter of the alphabet, and 88 represents the phrase \"Heil Hitler\". </p> <p>Cavanaugh said: \"The number 14 is a reference to a 14-word summary of Lane's views: 'We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children'.\"</p> <p>The documents say Cowart and Schlesselman bought nylon rope and ski masks to use in a robbery to fund their plot. They also say the pair admitted shooting out a window at a church with a black congregation in Brownsville, Tennessee.</p> <p>The secretary of the Beech Grove Church of Christ said the glass in the church's front door had been shattered while no one was in the building.</p>",
  "<p>Nature is cruel. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/55604/lion.king\">The Lion King</a> schooled me in the law of the jungle (aka <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=vX07j9SDFcc\">The Circle of Life</a>). I am aware that ferocious furry things must eat <a href=\"http://www.cuteoverload.com/\">cute furry things</a> to survive, and that ugly, slimy, scaly animals kill adorable creatures before feasting noisily upon their still-twitching limbs. Even so, I am routinely shocked by <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/autumnwatch/meettheanimals/avocet.shtml\">Autumnwatch</a>; it's like <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387564/\">Saw</a>, just with fluffy chicks.</p> <p>The lovelier the animal and the more limpid its imploring eyes, the closer its demise. The more we enjoy the sight of it scurrying along at dusk, the sooner it encounters its doom, and if we dare empathise with the adoring mother, you can be sure its death will be unpleasant.</p> <p>Last season on Springwatch (same show, different season) a nest of barn owls hatched. They were gorgeous - little bundles of down with enormous eyes - but it soon turned ugly. The Cornish owlbox murder saw a big bruiser of an owlet eat its younger siblings when daddy owl died and mummy was late with lunch (mice and voles; also adorable, since you ask). </p> <p>I first tuned in to the 'Watch to keep up with the antics of Jamie the wily old Glaswegian fox (absolutely the coolest, raggediest carnivore to forage outside a chip shop) but soon I needed counselling. Everything died. A clutch of ducklings? Dead. A litter of something? Dead with mummy howling inconsolably alongside bloody clumps of baby. </p> <p>This season may be the most distressing yet. Like children everywhere, my most traumatic film experience was (I'm welling up) the death of Bambi's mother. Autumnwatch features both Muntjac and Fallow deer, rendering tears inevitable: \"<a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=-eHr-9_6hCg\">Run, Bambi</a>!\"</p> <p>Oh, and there's also a grey seal, destined to be gnawed by sharks as it blinks with incomprehension.

  "<p>Poor advice is preventing many academically able pupils from non-privileged homes going to university, a new report has found.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/oct/28/oxford-cambridge-applications\">record applications to Cambridge University</a> suggest that its policies to widen participation are working.</p> <p>The Sutton Trust charity's report highlights the \"inadequate and inappropriate\" careers and education advice state school pupils receive, which means \"swathes\" of young people with the potential to go to university are missing out.</p> <p>The findings, presented in the charity's report to the prime minister's advisory group, the National Council for Educational Excellence, suggests support and guidance should be targeted at primary school pupils.</p> <p>All secondary schools should appoint a senior member of staff to provide targeted and up-to-date advice and information about applying to university.</p> <p>Sandra McNally of the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics, who carried out a review of research on schools' careers and education guidance packages, said they had not improved.</p> <p>Only half of 16- and 17-year-olds said the support they had received had been helpful; 58% said they would have liked more.</p> <p>Another study of university applicants showed 60% of those surveyed had not received enough information or no information about the relationship between higher education courses and employment.</p> <p>While 73% of those surveyed reported they had received either not enough or no information on the implications of their subject choices on their future.</p> <p>A survey of schools found that in nearly two-thirds of cases, careers guidance was being delivered by staff with no formal qualifications.</p> <p>The report found evidence to suggest education and careers guidance is seen as low status in some schools, with little time devoted to it.</p> <p>This could particularly disadvantage bright pupils from poorer homes, who do not receive the support they need to apply to highly selective universities, the Trust warned.</p> <p>Young people from poorer backgrounds are less likely to recognise the differences between universities than their better off peers because they have not been informed about the benefits of attending 'prestigious' universities.</p> <p>James Turner, the charity's director of policy, said: \"Today's school pupils need to negotiate an increasingly complex educational landscape, and the fear is that too many are making ill-informed choices early on which effectively put them out of the running for certain university choices and careers later in life. </p> <p>\"The absence of high quality advice and support has a particularly negative effect on young people from non-privileged backgrounds, who do not have access to networks of graduates and professionals to make up for deficiencies in the system.</p> <p>\"All young people deserve realistic and informed advice about where certain educational pathways lead and this needs to start early on \u2013 at least at age 14 \u2013 so they don't find themselves down a cul-de-sac of opportunity, wondering what could have been.\"</p> <p>The higher education minister, David Lammy, said: \"We must ensure that the most talented and hard-working children and young people are given every chance to achieve their full potential, whatever their background.\"</p> <p>He said the government had accepted the NCEE recommendations as part of this ongoing work.</p> <p>The shadow universities secretary, David Willetts, said: \"This new evidence gives a damning verdict on Labour's eleven years in office.

  "<p>Southern African leaders today agreed to hold a full-scale extraordinary summit in an attempt to break the deadlock over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/zimbabwe\">Zimbabwe</a>'s power-sharing agreement.</p> <p>Officials of the 14-member Southern African Development Community (SADC) said the summit could be held within the next week in an attempt to persuade President Robert Mugabe's ruling Zanu-PF party and opposition factions to implement the accord.</p> <p>The power-sharing deal was brokered by the former South African president, Thabo Mbeki, last month amid much fanfare, but Mugabe has refused to give up key cabinet positions, particularly control of the ministry in charge of the police.</p> <p>Tomas Salomao, the executive secretary of the SADC, told a news conference in Harare, the Zimbabwean capital, that control of the police was the main sticking point. He said the planned summit would consider a recommendation that the ministry be rotated, with the two main parties being in charge for terms of six months or a year.</p> <p>The opposition has resisted such an arrangement as it could further complicate an already cumbersome power-sharing proposal. But Morgan Tsvangirai, the main opposition leader, gained a small victory as the SADC agreed to his request for a meeting. The opposition believes that only a full SADC summit has the authority to put pressure on Mugabe to really share power.</p> <p>\"The extraordinary summit of the SADC troika recommends the holding of a full SADC summit to review the political situation as a matter of urgency,\" SADC said. \"The extraordinary summit noted with concern disagreements in the allocation of the [interior] ministry and urged parties concerned to reach an agreement.\"</p> <p>Several SADC leaders are increasingly impatient with Mugabe and may press him hard behind closed doors at the summit. </p> <p>This week's meeting was attended by Mugabe, Tsvangirai, Arthur Mutambara, who leads a smaller MDC faction, and leaders from South Africa, Angola, Mozambique and Swaziland - the last three make up SADC's troika, a special committee on politics, defence and security. Mbeki attended as the mediator who brokered the deal.</p> <p>The UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, said he \"remains distressed\" over the human cost of the stalemate. \"He is deeply concerned that the population of Zimbabwe faces many challenges, including critical shortages of all food, essential drugs, basic services, and clean water,\" a UN statement said.</p> <p>Zimbabweans are struggling with the world's highest official inflation rate of 231m%.

  "<p><strong>October 27 session</strong></p> <p><strong>Immigration</strong><br>Ministers moved to highlight tough credentials on illegal immigration, claiming someone is being stopped by the authorities every eight minutes. Immigration minister Phil Woolas said the government was ejecting people out of the country \"quicker than we have done before\" and he hailed \"improved\" figures for removal of foreign national prisoners.</p> <p>Woolas said: \"The measures that are being put in place to control our border to count people in and count people out using the e-borders system and of course the introduction later this year of ID cards with DNA fingerprints ... will mean we have the strongest and secure borders for many, many a year.\"</p> <p>Tory Patrick Mercer (Newark) said: \"I welcome the shake-up to our border security that you have talked about but I hope you can tell me how many illegal immigrants we have got rid of and how many you think are remaining that need to be got rid of?\" Woolas replied: \"The successes that have been put into place mean that we are now stopping one illegal immigrant every eight minutes in this country.\"</p> <p><strong>Local bus services</strong><br>Councils are to be given the final say on contracts to improve the quality of local bus services, junior transport minister Paul Clark said. The government was also acting to further strengthen employment protection for bus company workers.</p> <p>Clark said the government was amending the local transport bill to enable councils to run bus services as \"operator of last resort\" in very limited circumstances. The bill enables \"quality contracts\" to be set up to improve services on defined routes. Clark added: \"The government has listened carefully to MPs and local authorities.\"</p> <p><strong>Protest climate camp at Kingsnorth power station</strong><br>MPs accused police at a protest climate camp at Kingsnorth power station, Kent of unnecessary aggression towards campaigners.

He told Baker: \"I hope you ... have made those comments to Kent police so that they can be investigated. And if you feel that that process is unsatisfactory then you know that can then be taken to the IPCC.\"</p> <p>Former prime minister Tony Blair will not face any further investigation by the Speaker, Michael Martin, into claims he misled MPs over the \"Ecclestone affair\", it emerged.</p> <p>Martin had pledged to look into allegations that Blair personally intervened to secure Formula One's exemption from a tobacco advertising ban hours after meeting the sport's boss, Bernie Ecclestone. In a letter to Tory former minister John Maples (Stratford-on-Avon), the Speaker said Blair's answers about the timing of his decision \"could have been clearer\". But he ruled out any further action.</p> <p><strong>Government groups for Muslim women</strong><br>Government groups focused on Muslim women are \"patronising\", shadow cabinet member Baroness Warsi, a Muslim, warned. She picked out the example of the Muslim Women's Advisory Group, launched to advise the communities and local government department, and said: \"Creation of such groups is actually dividing communities and it is quite patronising because it says to Muslim women you can only engage with us as Muslim women and not as individuals.\"</p> <p>But Lord Patel of Bradford, for the government, replied: \"If it is suggested that by focusing on Muslims or Muslim women we are patronising them or creating divisions that were not previously there I completely disagree.</p> <p><strong>Security of small airports</strong><br>Small airports provide a \"leaky\" entry into the UK, Tory Lord Naseby warned. He said private aircraft and non-scheduled flights taking passengers in and out of the country were not closely monitored by immigration and security officials.</p> <p>Security minister Lord West of Spithead said the situation was \"an area of concern\".

She told MPs: \"Although I know members rely on the division bells, you do have other means of knowing when there is a vote.\"</p>",
  "<h2>What is the appeal case about?</h2> <p>The appeal case follows a high court test case between seven banks and one building society and the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) over bank charges, brought after hundreds of thousands of frustrated consumers attempted to reclaim money from their current account providers. The case, which began in January, was designed to determine whether the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 apply to bank charges. In April the judge found that it did, clearing the way for the OFT to assess what amounts to a fair charge for entering into an unauthorised overdraft, and perhaps to order the banks to refund customers who have paid more than this figure. It is that decision the banks are appealing. </p> <h2>What bank charges are we talking about?</h2> <p>The court case revolved around the fees levied by banks when an account goes over its agreed overdraft limit or a cheque or direct debit is bounced. Most banks charge around \u00a325-\u00a330, but some charge up to \u00a339, and do so each time you go further overdrawn. Some customers have managed to rack up thousands of pounds in fees, falling deeper into the red as more and more charges are applied. </p> <h2>Will the government's bail out of the banks impact on the case? </h2> <p>The judges should make their decision \"on the basis of the law rather than the economic situation\", says Phil Jones, head of personal finance at consumer group Which?. \"Stability is important in the banking system and we recognise that is the primary concern. We do not think there is a contradiction between having stable banking and treating customers fairly.\"</p> <h2>What happens if the banks lose the appeal?</h2> <p>The OFT could decide to set a maximum level for fees, as it did a couple of years ago with credit card default payments, ruling that they should not be above \u00a312. Account providers could be asked to repay any charges above that amount. Because many of the banks have changed their terms and conditions over the years, the court is considering whether these older contracts with consumers are sufficiently similar to the present ones for the judgment to apply to all.</p> <h2>How much can I get back?</h2> <p>This will depend on the final outcome of the case. However, claims can only go back six years. The OFT's report into credit card charges resulted in default fees being cut to a maximum of \u00a312. If the same level of charging is decided on in this case, many consumers could be entitled to reclaim at least half of what they have paid. This will be less than had they made an uncontested claim before the case went to court. Customers who did that got back all their money.</p> <h2>What if I have new charges - can I reclaim them? </h2> <p>Not at the moment. Last summer when the test case was first announced the Financial Services Authority (FSA) said the banks were allowed to sit on letters from consumers asking for charges to be refunded. At the same time cases that had reached the county courts were put on hold. The FSA's waiver <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/jul/21/bankcharges.banks\">has been extended until January</a> next year.</p> <p>Despite that, Which? says customers who have paid charges should <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/20/accounts.saving\">carry on downloading letters</a> and writing to their banks to make sure their complaint is in the system.</p> <h2>Should I instruct someone to handle my claim? </h2> <p>There are plenty of firms promising to recover charges on a \"no win, no fee\" basis, which can take up a big chunk of your compensation. This month a new company called Client Cartel Review promised customers a free service, but Which? says consumers do not need to use a claims management service.</p> <h2>Will banks and building societies start charging for current accounts?</h2> <p>They could well do. The \u00a33.5bn the OFT estimates the banks make each year from the charges is likely to be replaced by another revenue stream.</p> <p>There is a precedent for this: since the crackdown on credit card charges providers have increased charges elsewhere, with some even introducing annual charges for customers.</p>",
  "<p>Christianity has a long tradition of defiance of civil authorities in the cause of justice and human rights. Jesus suffered a judicial penalty in his death: Paul was repeatedly imprisoned for his proclamation of the good news of Jesus, and while Jesus himself could be regarded as the victim of a miscarriage of justice, Paul deliberately and purposefully broke the law for the sake of the Gospel.</p> <p>Over the centuries Christians have believed it their duty to defy tyrannical regimes, which sometimes themselves acted in the name of Christianity. The Reformation and the civil wars of the 17th century demonstrate that, as did Christian opposition to Stalinist Russia or the Third Reich. However, in the last century it became clear to many Christians that democratic governments, too, needed to be challenged by civil disobedience. Martin Luther King's defiance of American race laws is the best known example of this.</p> <p>So what of asylum seekers? Christians, and others, in many parts of the country have sought to challenge elements of the government's <a href=\"http://www.iasuk.org/C2B/document_tree/ViewADocument.asp?ID=411&amp;CatID=53\">asylum laws</a>. They have criticised the refusal to allow asylum seekers to work and so contribute to the economy. They have opposed a tribunal system which often appears to be based on an assumption of guilt and produces unsafe verdicts. They have challenged government assessments of \"safe\" countries to which to return asylum seekers, and they have provided food and shelter for those driven into destitution by our laws.</p> <p>All of these are topics of political debate, both locally and nationally \u2013 not least through contributions by bishops in the House of Lords. For Christians, there are two fundamental truths which colour their response. First, all humanity is made in the image of God and so all human beings are sacred. Second, Jesus came as a human being to share our experiences and is honoured in the poor and deprived.</p> <p>So Christians have a duty to defend and provide for those in need. Political argument is not enough. In a mining community during the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2004/miners_strike/default.stm\">1984-5 strike</a> we debated whether church and charitable funds could be used to provide food for striking miners and their families. We feared we might be sued for misuse of funds. We were clear that this was a risk we were prepared to take in the defence of human rights and human need.</p> <p>So Christians and others are prepared to break the law today where that is necessary to maintain the human rights of those in need. Human rights have been basic to the Christian gospel long before the contemporary acts and conventions. In Leeds we are both challenged and inspired by the case of <a href=\"http://www.networkleeds.com/group/group.aspx?id=\" 40837\" \">Manuel Bravo</a>, who committed suicide in Yarlswood detention centre in order that his son would not be removed to an uncertain and unsafe destination. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/sep/20/immigrationandpublicservices.immigration\">Bravo succeeded</a>, but at the ultimate personal cost. Christians will feel in some circumstances that they should assist those in hiding from the authorities, in order to prevent their removal to places which for them are not safe. Sometimes these will be countries which are safe for others but not, for example, for members of opposition groups in that society.</p> <p>Always there will be an obligation on Christians to provide food and shelter. So all our major cities now have organisations which provide such support for asylum seekers. These are rarely specifically Christian \u2013 Christians have no monopoly of the obligation for human equality and care. In many cases churches, however, are major contributors to such organisations, driven by their own Christian principles. Sometimes this involves provision of care for those the government would remove, and who are terrified of returning to their home countries.</p> <p>Finally, there can be specific occasions when Christians need to defend their fellow Christians, threatened with return to countries where conversion to Christianity in itself brings the threat of persecution. Tribunals are notoriously suspicious of conversion to Christianity, which is astonishing in a country whose law has been based on Christian principles. The right to choose one's religion, and to change it, is crucial to human rights legislation. Where that is defied, Christians will have a duty to defend their fellow Christians, though that may mean breaking the law.</p> <p>Christians are loyal members of the society and culture in which they find themselves. They support a governmental system which provides schools and hospitals and administers justice. Where human rights and freedom of conscience are concerned, however, they will recognise that they owe allegiance to a higher authority, and will put themselves at risk to obey it.</p> <p><em>John Packer is the Bishop of Leeds and Ripon</em></p>",
  "<p>David Tennant and Jude Law are yet to play the prince in the West End, but it feels like we are already awash with Hamlets. Consider the Royal Court's <a href=\"http://postcardsgods.blogspot.com/2008/09/now-or-later-royal-court.html\">Now or Later</a>: a young, suicidally depressed, lovelorn son sits in the court of an estranged father figure railing against him and threatening to bring the whole shooting match crashing down about everyone's ears. Sound familiar? He is visited by a range of his father's \"courtiers\", all of whom would \"seem to know his stops ... would pluck out the heart of his mystery\" if only they had the wit. It is commonplace to praise young actors by saying you can't wait to see their Hamlet, but on this showing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/sep/10/theatre2\">Eddie Redmayne</a> would make a blisteringly good prince. </p> <p>How about Rupert Goold and Ben Power's adaptation of Luigi Pirandello's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/sep/16/theatre2\">Six Character's in Search of an Author</a>? The action starts with a crew of documentary makers working in Denmark on a film about a young man who has chosen to end his life by assisted suicide at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dignitas_(euthanasia_group)\">Dignitas clinic</a>. In Goold and Power's new fourth act, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2008/oct/24/theatre-luigipirandello\">extends the play's meta-theatricality</a>, there is a riff on the number of Hamlets coming into the West End. Then, at the close of the play, the young man featured in the documentary appears on a large video screen reciting Hamlet's \"O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I\" before the producer of the documentary, trapped in the world of the stage, takes up the soliloquy. </p> <p>Then there is the Donmar-in-the-West-End's production of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/sep/18/theatre\">Ivanov</a>, starring Kenneth Branagh in the title role. Chekhov's hero already describes himself in Tom Stoppard's translation as \"a hangdog parody of a literary cliche\" and, more crucially, a \"provincial performance of a hand-me-down Hamlet.\" Given Branagh's long association with playing the Dane this provokes a knowing laugh, but it also hints at why his performance here lifts the play from being considered \"<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/09/18/btivanov118.xml\">the runt in the litter compared with the four great plays of Chekhov's maturity</a>\" to something that looks and feels like a classic. </p> <p>The most explicit signal that Hamlet is the play of the year comes from Lithuania, though. Perhaps their most feted director, <a href=\"http://www.okt.lt/index.php3?menu_id=16&amp;parent=5&amp;lang=e&amp;sid=2\">Oskaras Korsunovas</a>, has just unveiled <a href=\"http://www.okt.lt/index.php3?menu_id=2&amp;parent=2&amp;lang=e&amp;sid=38\">his interpretation</a>. It is only the fifth production of Hamlet that has been seen in Lithuania since 1935. In Korsunovas's production, the text is unsentimentally eviscerated; whole speeches and halves of soliloquies go missing, and favourite lines disappear. It is stark, creepy and surreal, featuring a scampering dog-like clown-devil and a giant mouse's head. But it is what Korsunovas does with the second half of the play that really makes you sit up and take notice: the whole text is effectively cut to ribbons and put in a kaleidoscope, with the consequences of scenes played out before the scenes themselves have taken place. </p> <p>In the last moments Hamlet murmurs \"Horatio, I am dead\", before he and Laertes take handfuls of stage blood and smear one another with them. Only then does Hamlet deliver \"To be or not to be\" - centre stage and covered in gore. It has never sounded more like a glorious hymn to suicide; a triumphant overcoming of conscience's cowardice. Horatio, who in clown make-up now plays his implied master, Fortinbras, delivers the line \"The rest is silence\". And it ends in sudden blackout.</p> <p>Sitting in a theatre in Vilnius, just down the road from the old KGB headquarters, the fact that Hamlet ends with Denmark being occupied by Norway becomes horribly significant following the recent Russian invasion of Georgia. And this is the point about Hamlet: in different contexts certain aspects from its vast scope suddenly leap out. But, underpinning it all is the sense of looming tragedy.</p> <p>As Britain hurtles toward a depression, and everyone seems more and more miserable, no wonder Hamlet, and plays which reflect its themes, have started springing up everywhere. It has been suggested that as the recession deepens theatre will see more and more feel-good shows. If the success of these Hamlets is anything to go by, audiences don't want to go to the theatre to run away from their problems, but to stare down the heartache, the thousand natural shocks and the sea of troubles.</p>",

  "<p>Iraq's relative calm is threatened by a festering Kurdish-Arab conflict over the oil-rich city of Kirkuk and other disputed territories, that could explode into the worst sectarian war the country has suffered since the 2003 invasion, a new report says today.</p> <p>The report by the International Crisis Group (ICG) says the territorial dispute is blocking political progress in Iraq, contributing to the delay in passing a law on sharing oil revenue, and threatening to put off critical provincial elections.</p> <p>Pointing out that the Arab-Kurdish dispute dates back to Britain's creation of modern Iraq after the first world war, the ICG report warns: \"In its ethnically-driven intensity, ability to drag in regional players such as Turkey and Iran, and potentially devastating impact on efforts to rebuild a fragmented state, it matches and arguably exceeds the Sunni-Shia divide that spawned the 2005 - 2007 sectarian war.\"</p> <p>At the heart of the dispute is the city of Kirkuk, home to 900,000 Kurds, Arabs and Turkmen, which sits on one of the country's biggest oil fields. It lies outside the northern zone run by the Kurdistan Regional Government, but is in practice run by Kurdish peshmerga fighters and a Kurdish intelligence service, the Asaish, which works closely with US intelligence. </p> <p>Arabs and Turkmen residents, who represent 40% of Kirkuk's population, claim they live in fear, particularly of the Asaish. </p> <p>The tensions in the city ignited in late July, when a suicide bomber blew himself up in the midst of a Kurdish demonstration. That triggered an attack by a Kurdish mob on the headquarters of a Turkmen party, where guards fired into the crowd. Over 25 people were killed in total and more than 200 injured. </p> <p>Soon afterwards, Nuri al-Maliki's government in Baghdad sent troops into three areas that had been under informal Kurdish control, further escalating tensions and threatening a direct stand-off between Iraqi regular army and peshmerga forces.</p> <p>The dispute over Kirkuk has derailed legislation in the national parliament to pave the way for provincial elections. Arab and Turkmen politicians demanded a guaranteed quota of seats in the Kirkuk assembly, but Kurdish parties refused.</p> <p>Kurdish leaders argue Iraq's constitution gives them the right to absorb Kirkuk and other historically Kurdish-majority areas, in the name of \"normalising\" demographics skewed under Saddam Hussein by forced removals and a policy of Arabisation.</p> <p>Today's ICG report recommends that the only solution to the seemingly intractable problem is an \"oil-for-soil\" trade-off, in which the Kurds are given the right to manage revenues from their own mineral wealth and receive security guarantees for the existing internal boundary between Kurdistan and the rest of Iraq, in exchange for deferring their claims on Kirkuk for 10 years. </p> <p>The report warns: \"The most likely alternative to an agreement is a new outbreak of violent strife over unsettled claims in a fragmented polity governed by chaos and fear.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Paul McCarthy - The Painter (1995)</h2> <p>In a scatological theatre of self-torturing abstract expressionism, the goon-voiced McCarthy, made up with bulbous balloon nose and rubber sausage fingers, cack-handedly flounces his penile dauber and gives the willies to scheming dealers and corrupt critics. Quite possibly the most insightful video-film ever made about a painter. (RC)</p> <h2>Steve McQueen - Deadpan (1997)</h2> <p>A timber facade of a house falls straight towards the camera with its window placed to exactly surround the stony-faced artist. This re-enactment of a Buster Keaton routine becomes, as it is repeated, an increasingly massive physical fact in McQueen's formidable cinematic sculpture. (JJ)</p> <h2>Ren\u00e8 Magritte - A Courtesan's Palace (1928), The Betrayal of Images (1929), Not to Be Reproduced (1937), Time Transfixed (1939)</h2> <p>'This is not a pipe' - the warning in French beneath Magritte's even-toned, smooth, matter-of-fact painting of what does in fact look like a pipe is 20th century art's most lucid declaration that the certainties and useful simplifications of four centuries of pictorial painting are at an end. The skill to shade rounded objects so they appear solid was once new and precious. In his painting of a pipe, The Betrayal of Images, Magritte announces the futility of such efforts: painting things so they look real has now become a cheap, banal technical skill.</p> <p>His painting illustrates this by its unexceptional mastery of the basics of design - the circular top of the pipe bowl is a foreshortened disc with a void within it, drawn with sterile academic precision. Yet the meaning of the picture and the future of art lies in the neat handwriting beneath: Ceci n'est pas une pipe.</p> <p>Magritte paints ironically. He is no more impressed by the energies of avant-garde style than he is by traditional conventions of representation. The fun for him lies in reproducing those conventions deadpan, so as to be able to calmly expose the betrayal of images. (JJ)</p> <h2>Kasimir Malevich - Black Square (1915)</h2> <p>The cracked dry surface of this painting is a relic of a revolution in art and life. The black square within a white square border once hung like an icon in the corner of a St Petersburg gallery as the banner of Suprematism - out of the end of the existing cosmos, a new reality would arise. (JJ)</p> <h2>Edouard Manet - The Fife Player (1866), Emile Zola (1868), D\u00e8jeuner sur l'Herbe (1863), Olympia (1863), The Balcony (1868-1869), A Bar at the Folies Berg\u00e8res (1882), The Execution of Maximilian (1867-1868), Music in the Tuileries (c1860), Alabama and Kearsarge (1864), Argenteuil (1874)</h2> <p>The son of a well-to-do official in the justice ministry in Paris, Manet was a bourgeois who went off with the avant-gardistes and died the traditional avant-gardistes' way: prematurely, with syphilis.</p> <p>The forerunner and hero of the impressionists, he took subjects and ideas from the Old Masters and launched them into his own modern world - too brutally for many of his detractors, though you could hardly call his work realist. Olympia is a reworking of Giorgione/Titian's Sleeping Venus - but instead of a goddess slumbering in nature, his sexy creature is a prostitute tricked out in silk mules, with a gold bracelet round her wrist, a flower in her hair and a velvet ribbon at her neck. </p> <p>Her decorated nakedness seems almost fetishistic. At her feet, a cat arches its back in pleasure. In the background, instead of an idealised landscape, is a black servant who deferentially offers the courtesan a bouquet of flowers from a client. </p> <p>The prostitute looks out of the canvas not exactly invitingly, but perhaps with a hint of challenge. When it was exhibited at the Salon, two security guards were detailed to protect it from the aggressive canes and umbrellas of the public. One contemporary journalist wrote: 'People crowd about Manet's rancid Olympia as though they were at the morgue. When art descends as low as this, it does not even deserve a note of censure.'</p> <p>It created a scandal - as did D\u00e8jeuner sur l'Herbe. That painting too had an impeccable Old Master as its forerunner, Giorgione's Pastoral Concert. This time, though, the fully clothed men picnicking in the picture were identifiably art students, the naked girl not a nymph, but a modern woman. As in Olympia, the sexual politics of this work are controversial.<br> In A Bar at the Folies-Berg\u00e8res, another woman gazes impassively at the viewer (or at least at the gentleman whose face is reflected in the mirror behind her). She is selling drinks, oranges and, perhaps, herself. (CH)</p> <h2>Andrea Mantegna - Camera Picta (1465-1474)</h2> <p>Cheeky cherubs look down from a parapet in the blue sky seen through a wide round hole above your head - but they are painted illusions. So is the sky, so is the aperture. Around the walls, lifelike portraits of the Court of Mantua play out an everyday drama. (JJ)</p> <h2>Piero Manzoni - Artist's Shit (1961)</h2> <p>No one has ever mocked the cult of artistic genius quite as succinctly as Manzoni with this small tin can labelled with what it contains, merda d'artista. It looks like something you might buy at a delicatessen in arty, foody Italy. (JJ)</p> <h2>Chris Marker - La Jet\u00e8e (1962), Sans Soleil (1983)</h2> <p>In a rat-infested post-nuclear Paris, survivors attempt to regain peace through time travel. The artist is selected as the subject of experiments attempting to recover memories and project them into the future: 'a twice-lived fragment of time'.</p> <p>Told through a sequential collage of stark black-and-white stills and a masterpiece of voice-over, La Jet\u00e8e is a stunned reflection on the variabilities of emotional time, set to the backbeat of an over-stimulated heart.</p> <p>Sans Soleil takes the theme even further with visual and verbal cross-associations of remarkable plaintive resonance. An anonymous cameraman travels through Japan and Africa recording 'things that quicken the heart' as his letters are read by their anonymous female recipient. We see cat cemeteries, a bonfire for laying to rest the souls of broken dolls and a spellbinding 1/24th of a second glance from a beautiful African woman that somehow affords time a spatial dimension. (RC)</p> <h2>Brice Marden - Cold Mountain 5 (Open) (1989-1991)</h2> <p>There is a flow and freedom and cool grace to Brice Marden's paintings, as if the dripped abstractions of Jackson Pollock had been remade by a Buddhist saint. This art is all on its own in its confident and captivating continuation of the abstract tradition. (JJ)</p> <h2>Simone Martini - Maest\u00e0 (1315), Guidoriccio da Fogliano (1328), Annunciation (with Lippo Memmi) (1333)</h2> <p>One of the most atmospheric wall paintings in Italy is a portrait of a medieval knight riding across a battlefield in Siena's communal palace. It has traditionally been ascribed to the wonderful 14th-century painter Simone Martini, but is Guidoriccio da Fogliano really by him at all - and is it even truly medieval? </p> <p>It has been argued that it is an 18th-century fake. Even without that chivalrous scene, Simone Martini's works are more than notable, especially his rhapsodic golden Annunciation with its elegant vase of lilies, sinuously curving figures, and narrow eyes exchanging holy excitement. (JJ)</p> <h2>Masaccio - Tribute Money (1420s), Expulsion (1420s), Trinity (c1426-1427)</h2> <p>Eve howls at the sky, her face collapsing in despair, and Adam places his face in his hands desolately as the Angel of the Lord shepherds them out of the gate of Paradise, in the most harrowing scene in one of Italy's great fresco cycles. Masaccio, who died young and left comparatively few works, was one of the greats of all time, thought Leonardo da Vinci. As for Michelangelo, he spent so much time in front of Masaccio's frescoes in Florence's Brancacci Chapel that other art students thought he was acting like the place was his alone and one of them, Pietro Torrigiani, assaulted him there and broke his nose. </p> <p>Michelangelo's drawing after the great scene of the Expulsion still survives in the Louvre. It was the monumental authority of Masaccio that so impressed them and that remains so impressive today - especially since a restoration removed the coyly placed fig leaf that for centuries had stopped anyone seeing what Michelangelo saw. (JJ)</p> <h2>Master of Saint Francis - Frescoes in Upper Church of San Francesco (13th century)</h2> <p>The Italian Renaissance begins with Saint Francis of Assisi, whose homely Christian vision rooted itself in everyday life and influenced the rise of a more emotional, human art that glows in the frescoes in Assisi, often attributed to Giotto himself.

  "<p>\"Truly marvellous and celestial was Leonardo\u2026 \" wrote Vasari in 1550. In five centuries, no one has found serious reason to quarrel with this assessment. Leonardo was born illegitimate in the Tuscan hill town of Vinci, still beautifully set today among olive groves, and one of his first great contributions to art was, at the age of 21, to draw the first dated European landscape \u2014 a dreamlike vista that transforms his childhood scenes into a fantastic space for the mind to wander in.</p> <p>Landscape \u2014 or rather, its release of imagination \u2014 is in many ways the key to understanding Leonardo. The rocky shapes in his youthful drawing return as caveperforated jabbing columns and distant blue mountains in The Virgin of the Rocks, and as massy forms in the background of the Mona Lisa. Always, your mind's eye is led into these yielding, atmospheric, rocky recesses of his paintings.</p> <p>Leonardo's rival Botticelli teasingly told him that painting a landscape is easy \u2014 you just chuck a paint-soaked sponge at the panel and let the colours run. \"He was indeed right that in such a stain various inventions are to be seen,\" responds Leonardo. \"I say that a man may seek out in such a stain heads of men, various animals, battles, rocks, seas, clouds, woods and other similar things...\" He elaborates on this creative method elsewhere and, when you look at his weirdly shaped mountains, it is clear this is very much what he did \u2014 his paintings make free use of subconscious suggestion, chance between the waking and dreaming minds.</p> <p>Leonardo is not only a painter but an intellectual, who filled copious notebooks with his speculations and research on a staggering variety of subjects. Perhaps the most beautiful of his notebooks to look through is Manuscrit B, now in Paris, in which domed churches \u2014 he was a great unfulfilled architect \u2014 are followed by a sketched idea for an armoured car and wondrous concepts for flying machines. His designs carry hypnotic conviction because he is simply the best draughtsman of all time. In the Royal Library at Windsor Castle you can see his anatomical drawings, at once visceral and humane, recording his own dissections of animal and human bodies; they are full of unprecedented observations later to be claimed by others. Here too are his Deluges, in which the forces of nature sweep away humanity, \"so cruel and horrible a monster\".</p> <h2>Key works</h2> <p>\u2022 Annunciation (c1472)</p> <p>\u2022 Landscape (1473)</p> <p>\u2022 Ginevra de'Benci (c1474)</p> <p>\u2022 The Adoration of the Magi (begun 1481)</p> <p>\u2022 Virgin of the Rocks (contract signed 1483)</p> <p>\u2022 Manuscrit B (begun in c1485)</p> <p>\u2022 The Last Supper (c1494-1499)</p> <p>\u2022 The Lady with an Ermine (c1488-1491)</p> <p>\u2022 Mona Lisa (begun 1503)</p> <p>\u2022 Burlington Cartoon (c1499)</p> <p>\u2022 The Virgin of the Rocks (second version) (1500s)</p> <p>\u2022 Anatomical drawings (c1508-1511)</p> <p>\u2022 The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne (c1510-1513)</p> <p>\u2022 Saint John the Baptist (c1513-1516)</p> <p>\u2022 Deluge drawings, Royal Library, Windsor Castle<br>(1515-1517)</p>",
  "<p>The recent launch of the <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/Acts/acts2007/ukpga_20070023_en_1\">Sustainable Communities Act</a> is just the latest instalment in the government's raft of reforms ostensibly aimed at empowering communities and giving people greater control over local services. For all my doubts about the so-called \"petition power\" and the wonder of \"asset transfer\", some of the proposals in the white paper, <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/communitiesincontrol\">Communities in Control: Real People, Real Power</a>, are arguably welcome. </p> <p>The opportunity for people to scrutinise their political representatives by holding \"local question times\" might just blow some of the cobwebs away in those dusty council chambers. And it would no doubt be a good thing if more of us took part in our communities and took on \"civic roles\". </p> <p>As communities minister Hazel Blears rightly says, \"There is a lot of cynicism about politics but it is through politics that we bring about change for the better.\" But this admirable sentiment is rather undermined by the cynical uses to which the communities agenda is being put \u2013 not to mention the proposed prize draw to reward voters for bothering to vote, one of the more troubling ideas. </p> <p>While it is undoubtedly the case that official efforts to \"engage\" us have, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/may/21/localgovernment.communities\">as David Walker has observed</a>, become \"public management cliches\", it is what he calls the \"new subjectivity of public services\" that makes the business of engagement so different today. The focus is on the intangible idea of community well-being rather than the provision of good quality public services. </p> <p>But while Walker argues that politicians and service providers just don't have the requisite \"emotional intelligence\" to engage with this new agenda, surely what is required is <em>real</em> engagement through political ideas and genuine attempts to grapple with the <em>real</em> problems that communities face. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/18/foreignpolicy.eu1\">As Simon Jenkins has argued</a>, this failure to engage with the electorate is only to be expected from a government that, for all its talk of devolving power, has nothing but \"contempt for democracy\". The political class, as he also says, hate being put to a vote. But it is not just elections that they find \"vulgar, foreign, exhibitionist and unpredictable\", it is the electorate themselves.</p> <p>Nevertheless, as Hazel Blears inadvertently let slip recently, these sorts of measures have as much to do with building political legitimacy as they do with building communities. \"In many parts of the country, local democracy needs a boost, with low turnout at local elections and people feeling they can't influence the way some issues are decided in their area,\" she said. </p> <p>With this in mind, the proposed duty on local authorities to \"promote democracy\" is not only a curiously bloodless way of engaging the disengaged. More worrying is the notion that democracy can be imposed by diktat. This authoritarian bent to the communities agenda reveals a thinly veiled attempt to paper over the exhaustion of politics and the increasing isolation of a clueless and desparate political class. </p> <p>Rather than acknowledging their own disengagement from society and their efforts to overcome it, the government has projected its anxieties onto communities in the name of empowering them.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Dave Clements is co-editor of The Future of Community: Reports of a Death Greatly Exaggerated, published by Pluto Press.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>, searching for a dramatic comeback with a week left to the election, portrayed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> yesterday as a dangerous liberal who would preside over the most leftwing administration in American history.</p> <p>But there was little sign of any turnaround in McCain's fortunes. His campaign team appeared demoralised, a mood not helped by a rally in Dayton, Ohio, yesterday, the set piece of the day, that failed to attract a big crowd.</p> <p>Even hardline supporters in the audience, shuffling out afterwards, said they did not think he had much chance of winning next Tuesday.</p> <p>Campaigning throughout the day in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ohio\">Ohio</a>, which he described as \"a must win\" state, McCain searched for a message that might resonate even at this late stage.</p> <p>After a meeting advisers in Cleveland, he described Obama as \"the most liberal person to ever run for the presidency\". He labelled as \"a dangerous threesome\" Obama, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, and Harry Reid, the Democratic Senate leader.</p> <p>McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin, took up the theme, telling a rally in Leesburg, Virginia: \"If big government spenders control the House and the Senate and, heaven forbid, the White House, they will have a monopoly in Washington.\"</p> <p>McCain returned to this theme at the Dayton rally, calling his opponent Barack the Redistributor.</p> <p>He referred to a 2001 radio interview in which, McCain said, Obama expressed regret that the civil rights movement had not brought redistribution of wealth. The arena was a relatively modest location, holding only 3,200 people, but McCain was unable to fill it, with empty spaces remaining on the main floor and along the sides. The crowd was estimated at just over 2,000.</p> <p>He has attracted only modest crowds all week, in contrast to Obama's rallies, which culminated in one at the weekend bringing in 100,000 supporters.</p> <p>On the way out of the Dayton rally, Brad Lowry, 24, who runs a small business in Dayton, said he was a McCain fan but said \"obviously it does not look good\". Lowry, describing himself as a gambler, added: \"He is definitely the underdog. If I had to put money on it, I would put his chances at 20%.\"</p> <p>Also in the crowd, Nancy Kussman, 63, who opposed wealth redistribution, was hopeful McCain might still make it. \"Obama scares me a lot. I am not confident about his past. I am uncomfortable with his wanting to give everything away.\"</p> <p>In the final days of campaigning, McCain and Obama are tracking one another across the battleground states. Both were in Ohio yesterday, and are scheduled to be in Pennsylvania today and Florida tomorrow.</p> <p>These states are turning into McCain's last stand. Having lost ground elsewhere according to the polls, he cannot afford to lose any of these three. This was his 14th visit to Ohio since securing the Republican presidential nomination earlier this year.</p> <p>McCain is also taking a beating on the normally passionately pro-Republican radio talkshows.</p> <p>Bill Cunningham, who broadcasts from Cincinnati and whose shows go out on 300 stations across America, criticised McCain at the weekend for the way he had conducted the campaign, made it clear he thought the election was lost and urged the Republicans to begin planning to ensure Obama does not secure a second term.</p>",
  "<p>Iraq's relative calm is threatened by a festering Arab-Kurdish conflict over the oil-rich city of Kirkuk and other disputed territory that could explode into the worst sectarian war the country has suffered since the 2003 invasion, a new report says today.</p> <p>The report by the International Crisis Group said the territorial dispute was blocking political progress in Iraq, contributing to the delay in passing a law on sharing oil revenue and threatening to put off critical provincial elections.</p> <p>Pointing out that the Arab-Kurdish dispute dates back to Britain's creation of modern Iraq after the first world war, the report warns: \"In its ethnically driven ability to drag in regional players such as Turkey and Iran and [have a] potentially devastating impact on efforts to rebuild a fragmented state, it matches and arguably exceeds the Sunni-[Shia] divide that spawned the 2005-2007 sectarian war.\"</p> <p>At the heart of the dispute is Kirkuk, home to 900,000 Kurds, Arabs and Turkmen, which sits on one of the country's biggest oilfields. It lies outside the northern zone run by the Kurdistan Regional Government, but is run by Kurdish peshmerga fighters and the Kurdish intelligence service, the Asaish.</p> <p>Arabs and Turkmen residents, who represent 40 per cent of Kirkuk's population, claim they live in fear, particularly of the Asaish. </p> <p>The tensions in the city ignited in July when a suicide bomber blew himself up in the midst of a Kurdish demonstration. That triggered an attack by a Kurdish mob on the headquarters of a Turkmen party, where guards fired into the crowd. More than 25 people were killed and more than 200 injured.</p>",
  "<p>The elite police marksman who shot Jean Charles de Menezes dead insisted yesterday that he had shouted a warning before opening fire and denied accusations of \"embellishing\" and \"grossly exaggerating\" his account to justify killing an innocent man. </p> <p>The officer, known only as Charlie 12, shot the Brazilian on a tube carriage at Stockwell station in London, claiming he had become convinced De Menezes was a suicide bomber.</p> <p>At the inquest into his death, Michael Mansfield QC, for the De Menezes family, said their case was that the marksman had not believed the Brazilian was about to detonate a bomb when he shot him, as the officer claimed before the jury and in his witness statement.</p> <p>Sir Michael Wright, the coroner, asked Mansfield: \"Are you putting a case that this officer did not honestly and genuinely believe at the time he pulled the trigger that this man presented an immediate and mortal threat to himself and other people in the vicinity?\"</p> <p>Mansfield replied: \"Yes,\" adding that his allegation was supported by the fact the officer had wrongly claimed he thought Menezes was wearing a bulky jacket and had claimed to have shouted a warning of \"armed police\" before opening fire.</p> <p>C12 wrote up his statement of what happened on July 23 2005, after he knew the man he had shot dead was innocent. He was the first officer to open fire, with a second marksman joining in later. De Menezes was shot seven times in the head.</p> <p>Giving evidence for a second day, C12 insisted he believed the man he shot on July 22 2005 had been identified by colleagues as a terrorist suspect who had tried to bomb a tube train the previous day.</p> <p>C12 said a colleague pointed De Menezes out as he reached the tube carriage. He denied he had made up his mind to open fire as he ran down the station's escalator, insisting it was De Menezes's \"aggressive\" reaction when challenged that led him to shoot, having assessed him as about to detonate a bomb.</p> <p>The officer claimed to have shouted \"armed police\" and pointed his gun at the suspect's head, only to see the man keep coming towards him.</p> <p>Mansfield said: \"I want to give you another opportunity, and it may be your last opportunity, to face a certain reality that you shot an innocent man who you had not properly assessed, who you never gave a chance to, because you were consumed with the thought of what he might have done the previous day. Now is that possible?\" C12 replied: \"It's not possible at all, sir. I did challenge 'armed police'.\"</p> <p>C12 said he remembered immediately after the shooting thinking he had made a mistake by shouting a challenge, because it would have given a suicide bomber a chance to detonate a device.</p> <p>Mansfield said six other officers in the carriage had made no mention of a warning being shouted in their statements or evidence. Furthermore, none of the 17 civilians in the tube carriage had heard it.</p> <p>He said: \"I am going to make it plain that what you did when it came to making a statement the following day was to grossly exaggerate what you saw in order to convince people that he had been a terrorist about to explode a bomb, in your mind. Is there any possibility you did that?\" \"Absolutely none whatsoever, no,\" C12 replied.</p> <p>C12 accepted he was in a position to stop De Menezes before he entered the tube station, but was not ordered to do so.</p> <p>The inquest will hear evidence today from the other officer to shoot De Menezes, known as Charlie 2.</p>",
  "<p>Dee Dee Warwick, the American singer and younger sister of Dionne Warwick, has died, aged 63, after a long illness. Celebrated in the 1960s and early 1970s for the beauty of her voice and appearance, her career was overshadowed by record-company mismanagement and the fame of her sibling, older by five years. </p> <p>Born Delia Mae Warrick in East Orange, New Jersey, Dee Dee came from a family who were prominent members of the East Coast gospel community. Her father was the director of gospel promotion for the Chicago black-music powerhouse Chess Records, while her mother managed the Drinkard Singers, a gospel group that recorded for Savoy, Verve and RCA Victor during the 1950s. The Drinkard Singers were led by Dee Dee's aunt, Cissy Houston (the mother of Whitney Houston), and both Dee Dee and Dionne sang with the group as teenagers. The sisters then formed a trio called the Gospelaires that sang both in church and on secular recording sessions in the late 1950s. Dee Dee's dulcet tones graced hundreds of soul and pop recordings over the next decade and she can be heard on hits cut by Garnet Mimms, the Drifters, Wilson Pickett, Aretha Franklin and Nina Simone.</p> <p>Dionne Warwick was discovered by the songwriters Burt Bacharach and Hal David in early 1963. Dee Dee was signed later that year by the celebrated songwriting-production team of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller and, following her sister's lead, changed her surname from Warrick to Warwick. Leiber &amp; Stoller produced her first single, You're No Good. Although not a hit when it was released, the song became a US hit for Betty Everett in 1964 (and a UK No 3 when covered by the Swinging Blue Jeans) and topped the US charts in 1975 when sung by Linda Ronstadt. Leiber &amp; Stoller tried again with Standing By (1964), but the single failed and Warwick signed with Blue Rock, a black-music subsidiary of Mercury Records and, with Ed Townsend as the producer, scored R&amp;B top 30 hits with We're Doing Fine and I Want To Be With You. </p> <p>Dee Dee's 1966 hit I'm Gonna Make You Love Me was remade into a huge pop hit the following year by Madeline Bell and then reached No 2 in the US pop charts (No 3 in the UK) when recorded as a duet between the Supremes and the Temptations. Warwick continued to issue high-quality soul music, her records possessing stronger rhythmic and gospel vocals than those of her sister, and in 1969 she scored an R&amp;B and pop hit with Foolish Fool. The song won Warwick a Grammy nomination and a guest spot singing on Dick Cavett's popular talk show. She then signed with Atco, a subsidiary of Atlantic, and was sent to Miami to record with top session band the Dixie Flyers, immediately enjoying a top 10 R&amp;B hit with She Didn't Know (She Kept on Talking). This won Warwick her second Grammy nomination. Her 1970 album Turning Around was well received, yet her career stalled, with the singles Suspicious Minds and Cold Night in Georgia being minor R&amp;B chart hits.</p> <p>Dee Dee returned to Mercury in 1973, claiming that Atlantic concentrated its energies on Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack to the detriment of her career. In 1975 she enjoyed an R&amp;B hit with Get Out of My Life. It was her last chart placing. Thereafter, she recorded for a variety of small labels before concentrating on providing backing vocals for commercial sessions and singing with her sister (most notably on Dionne's Why We Sing gospel album). Earlier this year the sisters toured Europe, Dee Dee providing background vocals for her celebrated sibling's My Music and Me performances. She is survived by her sister.</p> <p>\u2022 Dee Dee Warwick (Delia Mae Warrick), singer, born September 25 1945; died October 18 2008</p>",
  "<p>A typical conversation in the careers room currently: \"Is that it? What happens next? When will I hear?\" The first thing to counsel is that patience will prove to be a virtue over the coming months. You've completed your Ucas application in good time, done your bit, now it's over to the universities to do theirs. Sadly, it may well be some months before you hear anything.</p> <p>A common misconception is that once the student has completed the form, it is immediately sent to Ucas and has arrived on the virtual desks of the admissions staff. While this may be the case in some schools and colleges, in most it will take another week or so while the reference is collated and composed, then pasted on to your application. Check progress with the person responsible for writing your reference. For the lucky ones, the wonders of electronic transmission will result in some very swift offers. Some universities are already making offers to early applicants.</p> <p><strong>Will you get an offer?</strong></p> <p>Once Ucas has received your application, it will send you a letter in which your personal details and choices are confirmed. Check this carefully to make sure it's all accurate. If there are mistakes, contact Ucas immediately. You have 14 days in which to do this. The letter will include your personal ID and username to enable you to track the progress of your application. From this point, universities can see your application online - remember they cannot see your other choices - and it's now down to them to decide whether to make you an offer or not. They may invite you for an interview first, although interviews are much rarer these days. Alternatively, you may not meet their selection criteria and they will send you a rejection, or \"application unsuccessful\", as the terminology goes. While a few will hear from all their choices within the next few weeks, most will have to wait longer, even into next spring. Universities should make all decisions for \"on time\" applications by the end of March 2009, ie those sent in by January 15 2009. All your choices must make a decision. Most of the action happens during January and February.</p> <p>You can follow how things are going via the Track Progress button on the Ucas home page. Using your personal ID number and your log in details you can see what's happening with all of your choices at any one time. You will receive emails (letters if you did not provide an email) when there has been a change, so keep checking your inbox. You may receive reminders by text. Most students will check Track a few times a week to keep up to date. You can change personal details here and also add choices if you didn't use all five initially. This may well be appropriate for those who applied for medicine in the first instance. Later you will be able to respond to the offers you receive via Track. If you want to withdraw from a choice, you can do this online here. Should none of your initial choices provide an offer, there will be the possibility of adding extra choices later, too.</p> <p><strong>Be patient</strong></p> <p>Now the patience bit comes into play. Early applicants may well reap the reward of plenty of early responses and offers, but this isn't guaranteed. Some universities (or specific departments) prefer to wait until they have received all \"on time\" applications. Either way, all decisions must be transmitted to Ucas and then recorded on your Track page. Most offers will be conditional on your achieving certain grades or points from your 2009 exams, in very rare cases they will be unconditional if you already have what they want. Occasionally, you may be offered an alternative course - research this fully before committing. It can be very frustrating when all bar one of your choices have made a decision and the one that hasn't is the one you want. But don't hassle them.</p> <p>Finally, your own decisions. Keep your powder dry until all have responded. Then, in February or March, you must decide which two, if you've been lucky enough to receive more than two offers, to hold on to. This is a very important decision that needs judicious consideration. Usually the deadline for this is not until May, so use the time well by visiting your main choices on open days to help you make up your mind. As you can make decisions through Track, it's all too easy just to click and be done with it. Whatever you do, don't. If in any doubt, take advice.</p> <p>\u2022 John Beckett is a higher education adviser at City &amp; Islington Sixth Form College</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarification column, Thursday 11 June 2009.</strong></p> <p>In the article below about the rise of online academic publishing, we said the academic journal Behavioural and Brain Sciences had tried to manipulate quantitative measures of its influence by identifying a \"target article\" and then simultaneously publishing a number of \"comment\" pieces alongside it, providing the target article with citations from the moment of its publication. We were wrong. Because the comments do not contain formal citations to the target article, no citations are counted by either ISI Web of Science or Google Scholar, the two indexing systems mentioned in the article. We implied that the format of the journal was a recent innovation; it dates back to the journal's first issue in 1978.</p> <p>Online publishing has sparked an explosion in the number of places where academics can showcase their work. Today, no field of study is too obscure to have its own dedicated title. But have platforms such as the Journal of Happiness Studies or Archaeoastronomy and Ethnoastronomy News made academic publishing more democratic?</p> <p>Far from it, says Alex Bentley, an anthropologist at Durham University. \"We're just producing so much wordage that nobody has time to read anything. It makes academic publishing, and even science itself, a bit like trying to get hits on blogs or try to make yourself the Britney of science.\"</p> <p>Although the internet puts information at our fingertips, we have no time to trawl it. As a result, we trust sites like Digg.com to guide us through the information jungle. This phenomenon is called \"herding\" by economists, who use it to explain, say, fashion trends and stockmarket bubbles.</p> <p><strong>Decent exposure</strong></p> <p>For researchers, it means that exposure is everything. \"As a result of this lack of time, people are just hyper-focused on Science, Nature and PNAS [a journal of the US National Academies of Science],\" says Bentley. \"There are many high-quality printed journals that a lot of people aren't interested in any more because their article will be treated critically and then it won't have any impact. What they want is an article that can be treated uncritically and have a big impact.\"</p> <p>Adding to the problem is the fact that methods to measure research impact are becoming more numerical. For example, the number of times an article is cited by others has become a proxy for quality. There is even a formula that will reduce a researchers' whole career to one digit, called the H-index (<a href=\"http://http://bit.ly/H-index\">http://bit.ly/H-index</a>), which been used for recruiting researchers for tenure in the US. \"A lot of people feel that their H-index is the most important thing on their CV,\" says Bentley.</p> <p>This focus on numbers encourages both researchers and journals to play games to raise their impact scores. Some play harder than others. A journal called Behavioral and Brain Sciences has come up with a nifty way of boosting its impact factor - how often authors in it are cited. It now identifies a \"target article\", and then commissions a dozen comments to appear alongside it, giving the article 12 citations directly on publication.</p> <p>The game playing in the UK's research assessment exercise is another example, says Bentley. \"When considering what articles to submit for evaluation, you may have this really good one in a low-ranking journal, and then you have something in a high-ranking journal, and you always submit that high-ranking article to the RAE even if you think that what you wrote was much better in the other one.\"</p> <p>It is the research itself that suffers, he adds. \"There's a real danger of it becoming a popularity contest, instead of a truth contest. People are just going for the quick hit, the quick result. I'm not saying that scientists aren't publishing quality any more - it's just a strong temptation and new kind of motivation, and it's really corrupting the system.\"</p> <p>There is evidence to support the idea that online publishing is changing how scientists work. A study published in the journal Science in July this year (<a href=\"http://http://bit.ly/sciencearticle\">http://bit.ly/sciencearticle</a>) by James Evans, a US sociologist, found that articles published online cite more recent work than those in print. It also discovered that - although online authors cite more articles - the citations come from a smaller selection of journals and articles. Evans concludes that research may become narrower and more isolated in the future as a result.</p> <p>Online publishing is also changing the way researchers write articles. To be spotted, articles must be structured with search engines in mind. This is search engine optimisation (SEO), and several academic publishers tutor authors in how it's done (see box). The ground rules of SEO are to repeat keywords and avoid unnecessarily flowery language. In academic publishing, this is especially important for the title and abstract, which are the texts most usually searched and read.</p> <p>SEO can, however, make articles tedious to read. A headline that once read \"Of mice and men\" for a study that discussed the suitability of mice when testing drugs for humans might now say \"Suitability of mice for in vivo drug testing\" or something even more jargon-laden.</p> <p>But those who fear an end to eloquence in research articles should stop worrying, says Bora Zivkovic, community manager at open access publisher PLoS One and author of the blog Around the Clock (<a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/clock\">http://scienceblogs.com/clock</a>). According to him, today's dull SEO writing is a passing phase. The open access movement will tear down the walls between academic publishing and the rest of the internet, making eye-catching titles not only optional but downright necessary.</p> <p><strong>Better searching</strong></p> <p>\"Titles that go 'the effect of x and y is z' are perfect for machines right now, but the machines are getting better and advances in technology will mean that search engines are going to find the important keywords in the text,\" he says. But catchy titles and readable writing will be necessary to draw in lay people, journalists and bloggers, who will have a much bigger role in determining what research is read. \"Google loves blogs, so if your work is being blogged about, it will generate interest in your paper.\"</p> <p>\"Google Scholar initially wasn't very good, but now it is,\" he adds. \"It covers more of the literature than Web of Science [another, older academic search engine].\" However, the big difference about Google Scholar is that you don't have to be a rocket scientist to use it, he says. It is intuitive and will lead you to a free version of an article if one exists.</p> <p>As search engines get more sophisticated, the technology will hopefully result in better ways of measuring research quality, says Bentley. \"Citations have always been important. But they have never been as ridiculously important as they are now,\" he says. \"I think that people are recognising this and that we will see more evaluation mechanisms that are based on actually reading the articles.\"</p> <h2>SEO for academics</h2> <p>\u2022 The title should be specific to the project, yet concise. Opaque titles should be avoided. For example, write \"Genocide and Holocaust Consciousness in Australia\" not \"Australia's Forgotten Victims\".</p> <p>\u2022 Reiterate key phrases in the abstract, even if they sound repetitive. It's best to focus on a maximum of three or four different keyword phrases. Don't overdo it, as unnecessary repetition will result in the page being rejected by search engines.</p> <p>\u2022 People tend to search for specifics, not just one word. For example, they will search for \"women's fiction\" not \"fiction\".</p> <p>\u2022 Always check that the abstract reads well, and that it reflects the content of the article.</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, remember that the primary audience is still the researcher not a search engine, so write for readers not robots.</p> <p>Thanks to Wiley-Blackwell Publishing for their help with these tips</p>",
  "<p>The ruins lie silent and abandoned in the heart of the jungle; blocks of stone surrendered to the vines, which twist and writhe over temples, plazas and pyramids. Weeds and forest creatures have colonised the inner sanctums; mahogany and cedar trees swallow what once were roads, blotting out the sun. This is Tikal, the ancient Mayan city of northern Guatemala. There was a time when tens of thousands of people lived here. The architecture and urban planning - there are epic monuments, boastful inscriptions and even courts for playing ball games - embody boundless human confidence. </p> <p>Today the only voices are of murmuring tourists, interlopers into a domain of spider monkeys and jaguars. \"The imagination reels. There are reliefs, pyramids, temples in the extinguished city. The ... sound of flapping wings trickle into the immense sea of silence,\" wrote Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias, Guatemala's Nobel laureate. </p> <p>Shortly after its apogee, around AD800, the Mayan civilisation, the most advanced in the western hemisphere, withered. Kingdoms fell, monuments were smashed and the great stone cities emptied. Tikal now stands as an eerie embodiment of a society gone wrong, of collapse. How it came to pass is a question that has long fascinated scholars. Titles such as Ancient Maya: The Rise and Fall of a Rainforest Civilization fill faculty bookshelves. It has also provided fodder for literature and films, most recently Mel Gibson's Apocalypto. There is a grim, irresistible appeal to this tale of central American oblivion.</p> <p>Recent events have injected a jarring note into Mayan studies: a sense of anxiety, even foreboding. Serious people are asking a question that at first sounds ridiculous. What if the fate of the Maya is to be our fate? What if climate change and the global financial crisis are harbingers of a system that is destined to warp, buckle and collapse? </p> <p>No one is suggesting that vines will start crawling up the concrete canyons of Wall Street, or that howler monkeys will chase pin-striped bankers through Manhattan. Mayan kings who screwed up were ritually tortured and sacrificed with the aid of stingray spines to pierce the penis; an emphatic application of moral hazard. In our era, the only thing slashed is a bonus. </p> <p>There are, however, striking parallels between the Maya fall and our era's convulsions. \"We think we are different,\" says Jared Diamond, the American evolutionary biologist. \"In fact . . . all of those powerful societies of the past thought that they too were unique, right up to the moment of their collapse.\" The Maya, like us, were at the apex of their power when things began to unravel, he says. As stock markets zigzag into uncharted territory and ice caps continue to melt, it is a view increasingly echoed by scholars and commentators. </p> <p>What, then, is the story of the Maya? And what lessons does it hold for us? According to Diamond's thesis, this: the ancients built a very clever and advanced society but were undone by their own success. Populations grew and stretched natural resources to breaking point. Political elites failed to resolve the escalating economic problems and the system collapsed. There was no need for an external cataclysm or a plague. What did for the Maya was a slow-boiling environmental-driven crisis that its leaders failed to recognise and resolve until too late. </p> <p>\"Because peak population, wealth, resource consumption, and waste production are accompanied by peak environmental impact - approaching the limit at which impact outstrips resources - we can now understand why declines of societies tend to follow swiftly on their peaks,\" wrote Diamond in a 2003 article, The Last Americans: Environmental Collapse and the End of Civilization. The idea is expanded in his book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed. The link between environmental, economic and political stress is clear, says Diamond. \"When people are desperate and undernourished, they blame their government, which they see as responsible for failing to solve their problems.\"</p> <p>A visit to the jungle ruins in the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula, stretching from southern Mexico down to Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Belize, is a humbling experience. There is sticky, sapping heat and squadrons of biting, stinging mosquitoes. The Maya were not a homogenous empire like the Inca or Aztecs but a series of squabbling kingdoms. The first settlements have been dated back to 1800BC but what is known as the \"classic\" period started much later, around AD250. The final period - zenith and collapse between AD750 and AD900 - is known as the \"terminal classic\".</p> <p>Tikal, deep in the forest of Pet\u00e9n in northern Guatemala, was one of the Mayan capitals, a sprawling complex of limestone structures that was home to up to 100,000 people. Kings doubled up as head priests and political leaders. There were acropolises with hieroglyphs and pyramids with flat roofs from which astronomers and mathematicians mapped the planets and calculated calendars.</p> <p>The Maya accomplished all this without pack animals - no cows, mules or horses to heave and push, just human muscle - and with limited water, which forced reliance on rainfall. By AD750 there were several million in the region, most of them farmers. Monuments and palaces became ever grander as kings and nobles competed for glory. And then everything went pear-shaped. Archaeological records show monument building abruptly stopped, as did the boastful inscriptions. There is evidence that palaces may have been burned. </p> <p>Most dramatically, the population vanished. Over a few generations numbers withered from millions to tens of thousands, maybe even just thousands. Most abandoned the cities and migrated north. The birth rates of those who stayed tumbled. (Mathematically, Russia's population decline is on a similar trajectory). By the time Spaniards clanked into southern Yucat\u00e1n in the 1500s there was hardly anyone left. Today, lush vegetation has reclaimed Tikal, turning everything mossy and green, but the temples, the tallest pre-Columbine structures, rise high over the canopy. George Lucas used Tikal as the site for the rebel base in the first Star Wars film.</p> <p>To explain the mysterious collapse some scholars posit an invasion, or disease, or shifting trade routes, or a drought. There is wide agreement, however, that a leading cause was environmental pressure. \"The carrying capacity of the ecosystem was pushed to its limits,\" says Marcello Canuto, an anthropology professor at Yale. Lakes became silted and soils exhausted. Tilling and man-made reservoirs provided more food and water but population growth outstripped technological innovation. </p> <p>Complex and organised it may have been but Mayan society resembled a frog who stays in slowly boiling water, says Canuto. \"Things were brewing within the system that were not picked up until too late.\" When the political elites did react they made things worse by offering greater sacrifices to the gods and plundering neighbours. \"The kingdoms were interdependent and there was a ripple effect. They did not respond correctly to a crisis which, in hindsight, was as clear as day.\" </p> <p>The environmental trouble built up over centuries and was partly concealed by short-term fluctuations in rainfall patterns and harvest yields. But when the tipping point came, events moved quickly. \"Their success was built on very thin ice. Kings were supposed to keep order and avoid chaos through rituals and sacrifice,\" says David Webster, author of The Fall of the Ancient Maya. \"When manifestly they couldn't do it people lost confidence and the whole system of kingship fell apart.\"</p> <p>Which brings us to modern parallels. Webster, watching the season's first snowflakes through the window of his office at Pennsylvania State University, has been waiting for the question. Pinned to his wall is an old clipping about the fall of Enron Corporation in 2001. \"That was the first tremor,\" he muses. \"You know, human beings are always surprised when things collapse just when they seem most successful. We look around and we think we're fat, we're clever, we're comfortable and we don't think we're on the edge of something nasty. Hubris? No: ignorance.\"</p> <p>Some anthropologists hesitate to make direct links between ancient and modern societies, deeming it out of academic bounds. Not Webster. \"In common with the Maya, we're not very rational in how we think about how the world works. They had their rituals and sacrifices. Magic, in other words. And we also believe in magic: that money and innovation can get us out of the inherent limits of our system, that the old rules don't apply to us.\" He snorts.</p> <p>This is a modish view these days but it was considered cranky luddism back during the 1980s stockmarket boom and the 1990s dotcom bubble. That was when masters of the universe bestrode Wall Street and Francis Fukuyama caught the triumphalist liberal economic zeitgeist with his book The End of History and the Last Man. That era, to borrow from Star Wars, feels a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. Now Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers are history and governments are taking over banks and propping up markets. </p> <p>If traders and their mumbo jumbo about securitisation and derivatives resemble Mayan priests chanting in their temples then Bush and Gordon Brown are the hapless kings who egged them on rather than query the \"magic\". As chancellor, Brown blessed the conjuring. \"In budget after budget I want us to do even more to encourage the risk-takers,\" he said in 2004. Now the frailty is revealed and instead of Gordon Gekko's \"greed is good\" we are hearing Shelley's Ozymandias: \"Nothing beside remains. Round the decay/ Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare/ The lone and level sands stretch far away.\" </p> <p>Canuto sees an unhappy precedent. The Mayan kings who allowed their era's crisis to spin out of control were unfit to remedy it, not least because they were invested in the broken system. \"The ones who caused the crisis are the ones you don't want trying to resolve it.\" Bush, by coincidence of timing, is on his way out but Britain's prime minister and other G8 leaders are hanging on.</p> <p>Several commentators have argued that the financial crisis is but a squall compared with the ecological hurricane they say is coming. A European study estimates deforestation alone is causing a loss of natural capital worth between $2 trillion and $5tn annually. \"The two crises have the same cause,\" wrote George Monbiot in the Guardian earlier this month. \"In both cases, those who exploit the resource have demanded impossible rates of return and invoked debts that can never be repaid. In both cases we denied the likely consequences.\" With ecology the stock from which all wealth grows, the financial and environmental crises feed each other, says Monbiot.</p> <p>If so, the Maya offer an ominous glimpse of what may lie in store. \"Their population growth was like driving a car faster and faster until the engine blew up,\" says Webster, the anthropologist. \"Look at us. I'm 65. When I was born there were two billion people in the world, now we're approaching seven billion. That's extraordinary.\" Eventually pressure on scarce resources will overwhelm technology - and do for us as it did for the Maya. \"The western conceit is that we can have it all - and call it progress,\" says Webster. His voice drops. \"I'm glad I'm not 30 years old. I don't want to see what's coming in the next 40 to 50 years.\"</p> <p>Armageddon, like hemlines, is prone to changes in fashion. It has been on a roll with films such as 28 Days Later, I Am Legend and Blindness, which posit a world grimmer than anything Hobbes envisaged. Cormac McCarthy's post-apocalyptic novel, The Road, was hailed as an environmental fable. \"By day the banished sun circles the earth like a grieving mother with a lamp,\" he writes, before introducing baby-skewering cannibals. That too is being made into a film. Webster does not think things will get that bad. \"Not like Mad Max,\" he says, managing to sound almost cheery. \"But definitely unpleasant.\" </p> <p>The gloom may be misplaced. Reports of capitalism's death have been exaggerated before and it has stubbornly survived Karl Marx, the Great Depression, world wars and oil shocks. And in contrast to the Maya, it is possible our technology will prevail over population and environmental pressures. Malthusian doomsayers have consistently underestimated the capacity of better irrigation, pesticides, new strains of crops and other technologies to boost food yields. The rate of population growth is slowing and human numbers are expected to peak at around 9.2 billion by 2050 before declining. That Asians are moving more and more to western-type diets and consumer baubles will strain resources, acknowledges the Economist. But don't worry: \"There is no limit to human ingenuity.\"</p> <p>If the gloomy environmental prognosis is correct, and global warming is set to wreak major havoc, what are the chances we will respond better than the Maya? Electing Bush instead of Al Gore suggests limited wisdom in picking kings, and emasculating the Kyoto treaty was perhaps as sensible as burning corn harvests to appease the gods. When Republicans chant, \"Drill, baby, drill!\" it is not much of a stretch to picture them, barefoot and in traditional huipil shirts, rooting for another sacrifice.</p> <p>Nevertheless there are promising omens. Governments are beginning to assign monetary values to natural \"assets\" such as forests, a conceptual leap that could reinvent economics. The EU has set up a carbon-trading market to get industry to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The UN is pushing for a new climate treaty in which governments will pay tropical countries billions of dollars annually to leave their forests untouched. Ecuador has already requested $350m a year in exchange for leaving 1bn barrels of oil beneath its Amazon floor. \"I believe the 21st century will be dominated by the concept of natural capital, just as the 20th was dominated by financial capital,\" says Achim Steiner, head of the UN environment programme.</p> <p>Even so, would that be enough? Civilisations rise - and collapse - for many different reasons. If there is a simple lesson to be drawn from central America's abandoned ruins it is to protect the environment and control population growth, says Michael Coe, author of the seminal 1966 text, The Maya. \"No civilisation lasts for ever. Most go for between 200 and 600 years.\" The Maya, Romans and Angkor of Cambodia lasted 600. </p> <p>And us? \"Western civilisation began with the Renaissance, so we're hitting 600 years,\" says Coe. \"The difference is we have a choice whether to let things get worse or fix them. That's what science is about. But it takes will on the part of those who govern and those who are being governed.\" Coe, one of the world's leading experts on civilisation collapse, pauses. \"To tell you the truth, I don't know if we have that.\"</p>",
  "<p>Until the age of 30, the pioneering historian of west Africa, Christopher Fyfe, who has died aged 87, was still seeking a career that would fully engage his lively intelligence. During his teens, his father had moved from Queen's University, Ontario, to become principal of Aberdeen University, but his son found the closed academic circles in which he was expected to move stiflingly complacent. He left Gordonstoun school for University College, Oxford, but his history studies were interrupted by war service in the Royal Artillery. Although postwar teaching in occupied Germany broadened his experience, his future remained unsettled.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Christopher's brother-in-law, while serving with the colonial secretariat in the Sierra Leone capital Freetown, had observed that the col-onial records of the west African country were in urgent need of rescue. Since few trained archivists were available - and none with any interest in service in the tropics - nepotism was employed and, in 1950, Christopher was appointed to the post of government archivist. </p> <p>Within two years, applying advice from the Public Record Office and his own practical intelligence, he had retrieved priceless documents from damp and dusty cupboards, found them a temporary home on the campus of Fourah Bay College (now the University of Sierra Leone), and, once they were properly classified, instructed an assistant in the use of insecticides. He then returned to his family home in Blackheath, south-east London, to reflect on his knowledge of their contents.</p> <p>I had just been appointed to a history lectureship at Fourah Bay, and met Christopher before leaving. He told me of his intention to write a history of Sierra Leone, which he expected to take about two years. Actually, it took 10. As I began to research and teach in the unfamiliar field of African history, our correspondence became a stimulating resource; many humid afternoons were lightened by a densely inscribed air-letter, recounting trials and triumphs of the early Creole community.</p> <p>When A History of Sierra Leone appeared in 1962, it was, as Christopher later admitted, \"more often referred to than read\". This was largely because of the austere format which, influenced by his reading of Wittgenstein and James Joyce, Christopher deliberately imposed on his publisher. Its 620 pages of text are divided chronologically into 23 untitled chapters, each composed of concise summaries of specific and diverse developments and events. There are no footnotes; precise references require a search through 153 pages of index, end-notes and bibliography. I suspect I was the only reviewer who read the book from beginning to end.</p> <p>And yet, it carried a powerful message about the achievements of the Creole community that was being formed on the peninsula then known as Sierra Leone. After contributing substantially to the territorial expansion of the Victorian empire, Creoles had been edged out of public and ecclesiastical office, and were often ridiculed as pathetic hybrids in the country they had come to think of as \"home\". Perceiving a mission to rescue them from such hostility and grudging condescension, Christopher celebrated their historic role as \"the unrecognised vehicle by which not only British rule but trade, education, and Christianity, were conveyed to west Africa\".</p> <p>His work was quickly appreciated by the community for which it was intended. If few Sierra Leoneans read the complete book, many devoured his well-written articles and his documentary anthology, Sierra Leone Inheritance (1964). His condensed version was cherished in many Freetown homes, and became an indispensable text in schools. Meanwhile, young Creole scholars, such as Eldred Durosimi-Jones, applied their talents to studies of their own culture and language, and began to celebrate their identity - and their contribution to the Sierra Leonean nation - later adopting a new designation as Krio. When the bicentenary of Freetown was celebrated at an international, inter-disciplinary conference in 1987, Christopher was honoured as godfather of a remarkable cultural revival.</p> <p>During the 1950s, the little band of British historians of Africa grew in numbers and confidence, and it quickly recognised the importance of Christopher's work. After temporary appointments at Queen's University Belfast and at Bristol, in 1962 he was appointed as a lecturer (and a reader two years later) at Edinburgh University, quickly becoming a key figure in the Centre of African Studies. Absorbing the growing scholarly literature, he soon found a new mission as a teacher. His lectures synthesised current research in a concise and provocative style, modelled on AJP Taylor, whom he had admired as an undergraduate.</p> <p>Besides further research on Sierra Leone (including, in 1972, a biography of James Africanus Horton, the first African Edinburgh graduate), much of Christopher's creative energy now went into planning and contributing to interdisciplinary conferences and symposia, and into a stint as editor of the Journal of African History. He refused all professorial offers on the grounds that younger academics should be encouraged, and retired in 1970. </p> <p>Although he spent his later years in Blackheath, he came to love the city of Edinburgh as well as its university, and in the Old Town Association he campaigned successfully against the menace of brutalist architecture. He was also an early supporter of the Traverse Theatre. But nothing gave him more pleasure than the guidance of African students, and his frequent visits to old friends in Freetown. He never married.</p> <p>\u2022 Christopher Hamilton Fyfe, historian of west Africa, born November 9 1920; died August 26 2008</p>",
  "<p>When Janet Paraskeva was profiled in the Guardian in 2000, just as she was taking up the job of chief executive of the then hugely troubled Law Society, she was described as \"an instinctive seeker after alarming challenges\". Now her instinct has led her to seek what many would see as the ultimate alarming challenge: sorting out the Child Support Agency.</p> <p>The letters \"CSA\" have, over the last 15 years, become a byword for badly-made policy and worse implementation. The agency's image is such that it has proved almost impossible to convince the media and the wider public that recent improvements in its performance have been genuine. Even Paraskeva admits to having had a thoroughly negative view.</p> <p>\"I had always thought, as somebody completely outside it, that the CSA really didn't offer anybody much of a service,\" she says. \"Like everybody else, I read the newspapers; I read about the disasters; I worked with women who worked in women's aid projects, and with community workers, who knew the difficulties that some of the parents with care [of children] were actually having.</p> <p>\"The very fact that the state was not allowing the money that non-resident parents were providing to go to the mother and the child just seemed to be completely ridiculous.\"</p> <p>That changed in a small way in 2000, seven years after the agency was set up, when \"parents with care\" - usually mothers - were allowed to keep \u00a310 a week of a child maintenance payment without it affecting any benefits they received. From this week, and for the next 18 months, they will be able to keep \u00a320; from April 2010, they will be able to keep all of a payment.</p> <p>From this week, too, people already on the CSA's books will be able to choose to make their own arrangements for child support - something that new benefit claimants have been able to do since July - and a new organisation, the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission (CMEC), is taking charge of the system.</p> <p><strong>Bury the letters</strong></p> <p>It is this body that Paraskeva was appointed to chair. It assumes responsibility for the CSA, but the agency itself will continue for the time being. A new statutory child maintenance scheme is scheduled for introduction in 2011, with the 1.4m existing cases being transferred during the following three years. \"It will probably be 2014 before we can bury those letters,\" she says, insisting that she as yet has no idea what \"CSA\" should be replaced by at that point.</p> <p>Paraskeva accepts that she has become identified as a fixer of what she calls broken organisations. It all started, she recalls, when, working in the youth sector, she was asked to chair the \"pretty broken\" British Youth Council. Did she mend it? Put it this way, she says, her successor was one Peter Mandelson. \"I don't think he would have taken the chair when I took it on, but he certainly did afterwards.\"</p> <p>From the youth sector, she went on to run the National Lottery Charities Board for England - subsequently renamed the Community Fund, then the Big Lottery Fund. It was a new body, and so unbroken, but an intensely hot seat at the time, with the tabloid press seeking to expose spending on any cause judged overly politically correct. Sooner or later, that experience under media fire is likely to prove useful on the child support front.</p> <p>At the Law Society, she found a venerable organisation in internal trauma and in need of reform and fresh direction, both of which she duly delivered. With that record, it was no surprise that she was plucked to become first civil service commissioner, the head of the independent commission that ensures open and fair recruitment to the civil service and investigates appeals from officials. She still holds the post two days a week, alongside her new CMEC role, also two days, and the chairing of the Olympic Lottery Distributor, set up to fund facilities for the delivery of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games.</p> <p>\"You have to box and cox the days,\" she says, \"but it's not that different to a single, busy job where you have to go from one thing to another.\"</p> <p>Paraskeva is at pains to stress that this week does represent a watershed for child support in Britain, despite the continuation of the CSA. \"I think the message to the media is: 'Look, it is a different organisation.' There are new things we are trying to do and, yes, we are taking over the governance of the old - and that does mean the old system, the old computer system, with all its upgrades, and some of those very recent and very successful. But actually I believe that the progress over the last few years is a really good stepping stone for us. And I don't believe that the existing CSA is broken any longer.\"</p> <p>As evidence of this belief, she has appointed as her executive commissioner Stephen Geraghty, who was the CSA's chief executive from 2005. He joined the agency from Direct Line insurance and is credited with improving performance to the point where the agency's backlog of cases is now down to below 100,000 - compared with more than 300,000 in 2005 - and the proportion of non-resident parents paying maintenance is on course to match systems in other countries by next spring.</p> <p>This improvement may be partly why, since July, very few new benefit claimants have taken up the option of reaching their own, voluntary maintenance agreements. But Paraskeva is confident that CMEC's new Child Maintenance Options service, an impartial information and support service staffed by 200 newly recruited workers, will prove popular both with new claimants and existing clients once people start to understand that there is no longer any compulsion to use the CSA.</p> <p>\"The government has changed the policy fundamentally,\" she says. \"From now on, it's all about getting money to the child, and the state will not intervene unless you want it to. We are going to give you every chance, and support, to bring about the best arrangements so that maintenance flows to the child.\"</p> <p><strong>A bit of healthy scepticism</strong></p> <p>A central part of this fresh approach will be a new transparency in the way CMEC conducts its business and a new inclusiveness. Paraskeva wants to see councils, children's centres and health visitors referring parents to the organisation, and she has already taken steps to draw in critics of the CSA. At CMEC's first board meeting last month, \"key stakeholders\", including fathers' groups, were invited to discuss with the board, and each other, how the organisation should go forward.</p> <p>There was, Paraskeva admits, a degree of scepticism. \"You couldn't blame any group for being sceptical could you?\" she says, laughing. \"And a bit of healthy scepticism can be useful, frankly. We don't want everybody to sit around and nod and agree with us. We actually need these stakeholder groups to challenge us.\"</p> <p>So what is Parskeva's ambition for the new organisation? In the long term, she hopes for a sea change in understanding about parental responsibility inside and outside relationships. She herself is a divorced mother, now openly gay and in a civil partnership. In the shorter run, though, she simply wants to offer a range of services - be it merely advice, arrangement of maintenance, or enforcement - that people trust enough to use.</p> <p>\"If in five years' time,\" she says, \"we were able to put up placards on the roadside, saying: 'If you are having difficulty, phone this number', and we were able to handle the volume of people that might call, then I would feel that was a success.\"</p> <p>\u2022 CMEC is at <a href=\"http://childmaintenance.org\">childmaintenance.org</a> Child Maintenance Options is at <a href=\"http://cmoptions.org\">cmoptions.org</a></p> <h2>Curriculum Vitae</h2> <p><strong>Age </strong>62.</p> <p><strong>Lives </strong>North London.</p> <p><strong>Status </strong>Civil partnership; two daughters from previous marriage.</p> <p><strong>Education </strong>Newport High school; Hastings High school; Worcester College of Education (Cert Ed biological sciences); Open University (BA social sciences).</p> <p><strong>Career </strong>2007-present: chair, Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission; 2006-present: first civil service commissioner; 2006-present: chair, Olympic Lottery Distributor; 2000-06: chief executive, Law Society; 1995-2000: director for England, National Lottery Charities Board; 1991-95: chief executive, National Youth Agency; 1988-91: director, National Youth Bureau; 1981-88: schools inspector; 1978-81: head of youth work unit, National Youth Bureau; 1972-78: various youth work roles; 1970-73: self-employed toy maker; 1967-71: teacher (science and maths).</p> <p><strong>Interests </strong>Gardening; grandchildren.</p>",
  "<h2>Boy shoots himself dead in Uzi arms fair accident</h2> <p>An eight-year-old boy died after accidentally shooting himself in the head while firing an Uzi submachine gun under adult supervision at a gun fair. The boy lost control of the weapon while firing it on Sunday during the Machine Gun Shoot and Firearms Expo, at the Westfield Sportsman's Club, Massachusetts, a police officer said.

Of the 58.8 million people who died in 2004, most were over 60, but nearly 20% were under 5.

  "<p>The first prosthetic heart to beat like a living organ could be fully implanted into patients within three years, in a breakthrough which could transform the survival chances of people who have suffered major heart attacks.</p> <p>French cardiac specialist Alain Carpentier said his prototype artificial heart - which is shaped like a human organ and pumps blood in the same rhythm - would be ready for clinical trials and commercial production by 2011.</p> <p>The device, which uses electronic sensors to control the heart rate and blood flow, was developed with the help of the engineering expertise from the European aerospace group Eads. </p> <p>It uses chemically enhanced animal tissue to decrease the risk of rejection by the patient's immune system, the major obstacle in artificial heart transplants.</p> <p>\"We are moving from pure research to clinical applications. After 15 years of work, we are handing over to industry to produce an artificial heart usable by man,\" Carpentier said yesterday as the device was unveiled.</p> <p>\"If you show the graphs to a cardiac surgeon he will say it's a human heart, but no, it's not. It's the prosthesis.\" Tests conducted on computer simulations and calves and sheep, have come back with \"no complications\" he added, paving the way for full clinical trials.</p> <p>Researchers are fine-tuning sensors which automatically adjust the heart rate to the patient's activity, such as walking or resting, a recurring problem in prosthetic heart trials. The device will be battery-powered.</p> <p>If successful, Carpentier's device will help patients who have suffered major heart attacks, late-stage heart failure or for whom full transplants are unavailable.</p> <p>Several teams from around the world are locked in a race to develop the perfect artificial heart, in effort to bridge the gap between demand for heart transplants and the short fall of donors, estimated at 20,000 each year.</p> <p>Two rival prototypes, the AbioCor and MagScrew Total Artificial Heart, have been developed in the US, but only act as a \"bridge\" until a donor can be found. Carpentier's team has spent about \u20ac55m (\u00a344m) on the prototype and assuming the French medical watchdog approves the clinical trials - and the development team can find the estimated \u20ac100m for production - it could be available to patients by 2013.</p>",
  "<p>The police officer in charge of crowd control at Saturday's Wear-Tyne derby has blamed alcohol for the violence in and around the Stadium of Light during Sunderland's win over Newcastle United. </p> <p>\"Some fans had been on the drink since 9am; we had one Newcastle supporter who was so drunk he passed out on a coach on the way to the game. Alcohol played a big part in the problems,\" said Chief Superintendent Neil Mackay of Northumbria police last night. \"It's very sad that people drink so much before matches.\"</p> <p>Although a small pitch invasion at the end, prompting 11 of the day's 29 arrests, provoked the biggest headlines it was not Mackay's principal concern. \"I don't think it was premeditated violence, it was spontaneous celebration which spilled over into confrontation with Newcastle fans,\" he said. </p> <p>\"What concerns me more are incidents of coin throwing and things that went on outside the ground. One of my officers has a broken wrist and a firework was thrown at another officer. It is only luck that terrible injuries were avoided. This is not the end of it, though. We are working through CCTV footage and there will definitely be more arrests. There could well be prison sentences and life bans from football grounds. We want to try to deter people from behaving like this.\"</p> <p>While policing outside the ground was largely successful in that the two groups of fans were kept well apart, the lack of segregation inside prefaced that trouble at the end.</p> <p>\"Part of the problem was that the game was a sellout so there were no empty seats to use as a buffer zone between fans,\" said Mackay. \"Personally I would have liked to have seen a bigger space between the two sets of supporters but I was happy with the number of officers we had in the narrow line separating them on the day. </p> <p>\"Post-Hillsborough you cannot have physical barriers between sets of fans so segregation can be a difficult area, particularly when every seat is sold. Another difficulty is controlling who the tickets are sold to.\"</p> <p>Like the Football Association, Northumbria police have launched an inquiry into what went wrong and are keen to work with Sunderland to prevent a repeat. While the club are unlikely to face FA sanctions Sunderland are responsible for ticket distribution and seating arrangements and may be asked to review both.</p> <p>Mackay's team are studying CCTV of fans suspected of throwing plastic bottles and coins at Joey Barton as he warmed up and will assess whether more police and/or stewards should have patrolled that area. \"Coin throwing really worries me,\" said Mackay. \"But again, I think alcohol has a lot to do with it.\"</p>",
  "<p>Victoria Pendleton goes back into battle this weekend and, beneath her concentrated gaze, the fatigue and the scars are clearly visible. High up in the last row of an empty Manchester Velodrome, with the silence broken only by her quietly urgent voice and the low hum of wheels speeding past on the track below, Pendleton provides a revealing insight into a brutally competitive world.</p> <p>\"Believe me,\" she says softly, \"it's a constant struggle. People say, 'Wow, you've achieved it all this year, two world championship wins and an Olympic gold medal.' And I think, 'Yeah, but how come I feel so unsatisfied and under pressure all over again?'\"</p> <p>Pendleton's bruised and candid intimacy as a sprint cyclist trashes the usual banalities of a sports interview. Rather than trundling out evasive platitudes about fulfilling a dream or maintaining her focus, she reveals the doubt and yearning that make her most human. \"I am an insecure person,\" she says behind a set of spectacles that could teach Sarah Palin a thing or two about style. \"I am emotional. I am a self-critical perfectionist.\"</p> <p>She adjusts her glasses and then shakes her head as she reflects on that rapid-fire list of character traits while, out on the steeply banked track, the four men in GB's team pursuit keep their heads down and their legs churning in a ferocious training session for this weekend's World Cup in Manchester. \"I'm terrible. I beat myself up the whole time because I'm striving for something I'll basically never achieve. I portray this image of confidence, of arrogance, and it's not really me. I'm never satisfied and I'm never content. It means I'm a bit of a mess some of the time. But I wouldn't be here talking to you if I was a different person.\"</p> <p>The 28-year-old thinks hard when asked why, even after six world championship titles and an Olympic gold medal over the last three years, she still feels insecure. \"I just want to prove that I am really good at something. And I haven't quite done that yet - at least not to myself. I know I could ride so much better, with more ease, with more finesse. I feel I'm nowhere near as good as I should be.\"</p> <p>Those anxieties have risen back to the surface because, this weekend, Pendleton will try to win both the women's sprint and keirin in the World Cup. Some might regard it as a homecoming party for a triumphant team but Pendleton girds herself instead for another harsh and potentially humiliating personal examination. \"I'm thinking, 'Holy Moly, I can't sneak under the radar here.' I'm coming in as world and Olympic champion and so I don't want to be explaining to the media afterwards about what went wrong. For me to be beaten now would be really distressing.\"</p> <p>Pendleton is known for her assurance on the track, and some have accused her of vanity beyond it, but in person she is disarmingly vulnerable and frank. \"Yesterday I was doing some times on the track and I was winding up for this really big effort and I felt fatigued even before I tried to get going. I thought, 'Oh gosh, this is really hideous.' I really can't maintain the form I was in at the world championships [in March] and the Olympics this long. I've worked at it these last few weeks but I'm struggling. </p> <p>\"I felt even worse at the national championships in September. I won the sprint and the keirin but my times weren't up to much and there was hardly anyone there. I felt quite tearful because the atmosphere was totally flat. It was a grim return to reality.\"</p> <p>And yet, with the restless intensity that defines the world's best competitors in any vocation, Pendleton did not enjoy her Olympic experience. Apart from a traumatic wait as her team-mates won one gold medal after another while her event was decided on the last day of competition, even her victory was tinged with bluesy relief rather than ecstasy. \"I was an emotional wreck beforehand because, while I was happy for everyone else, I was apprehensive about my ride. I worried that I would be the one person who let down the team. So winning was just a relief. And even that felt like a complete anti-climax. It was very surreal on the podium and as soon as I stepped off it I was, like, 'What on earth am I going to do now?' I found it quite hard to deal with. It was, like, I've got no purpose anymore.\"</p> <p>Pendleton's voice trails away but, amid such soul-baring, she quickly reasserts her striking ambition. \"I soon worked out that the only thing I could do was to get another gold medal. I need one. If 2012 goes to plan, winning the Olympics on my home turf, I might finally feel I've achieved the ultimate for me.\"</p> <p>As if surprised by her voracious pursuit of the quintessential sporting victory, Pendleton uncovers another side to her character. \"In some respects I crave a life where I don't feel guilty about staying out late or having a glass of champagne. I would quite like to have a normal life and just enjoy riding my bike - rather than doing everything with such purpose. It's the same with relationships. I struggle with them because in the past I haven't been committed enough to people. Gold medals have always been way above boyfriends - sorry! And that causes problems because it tells a guy he's not my priority.\"</p> <p>Her latest relationship is, at least, working out more smoothly. \"I haven't been going out with him for long - but he's been really understanding so far.\"</p> <p>Pendleton is admirably open when asked whether she would like to have children. \"Yeah, I really would. At the moment kids are simply not an option until 2012. But I must admit that as I get older the idea of having kids does become less repulsive than it was a few years ago. Maybe it's a hormonal thing but when I see kids now I sometimes think, 'Yeah, it would be nice to have some of my own.' As much as I love my life, and the fact I don't sit behind a desk and I experience wonderful things in amazing places, I still crave normality.\"</p> <p>As a self-confessed girly-girl, who can follow up her musings on motherhood by confirming happily that she had been awarded the title of Britain's most glamorous Olympian in Beijing, Pendleton is a refreshing presence in professional sport's overheated world of strutting masculinity. She is also at her most engagingly polemical when taking on the Olympic chauvinism that means women track cyclists are only allowed a portion of the races on offer for their male counterparts. </p> <p>\"I don't know how they get away with it. Three events compared to seven for the men? That's not even half so it's particularly sexist. If this was swimming or athletics it wouldn't be allowed. There've been rumours that they might deign to add another women's event in 2012 but whether it's a sprint or an endurance [race]who knows? It pisses me off.</p> <p>\"And what other sport has to deal with the attitude we get as cyclists on the road? I certainly haven't noticed any sudden courtesy to cyclists in the wake of us being the most successful British team in the Olympics. I cycle to the velodrome most days and I have one narrow escape for every hour on the road. I just think, 'Holy shit, I could die on my bike out here.' </p> <p>\"To a cyclist, these bloody motorists might as well be running around with a loaded gun. When you have that sort of attitude towards cyclists how are we going to move our sport into the mainstream?\"</p> <p>The only way, as Pendleton herself stresses, is to keep winning - starting with another clinical surge this weekend. She might be riding on empty but there is such desire within her that it is easy to believe she will overcome her exhaustion and out-sprint her rivals yet again. Her earlier sense of deflation has clearly been obliterated by the time she gets around to revelling in the gladiatorial combat of sprint cycling. </p> <p>\"It's all about portraying this image of being strong and almost indestructible. Even if you're flapping away on the inside you have to walk out there with your shoulders back, your head up and this stern expression on your face. It's very serious. I'm quite good at it now - or maybe I'm just a good actress. At the world championships in 2006 I was sitting opposite the Chinese girl before the final and she looked so pale I knew I'd won even before I got on my bike. </p> <p>\"I thrive on that - and that's why I was sure I'd beat [Australia's] Anna Mears in the Olympic final. Anna used to push me about. She was a bit of a bully until I beat her in the worlds in 2005. The tables turned that day and she's not beaten me since. It's such a mental thing and when my mind's right I can beat anyone in the world.\"</p> <p>A suddenly rejuvenated Pendleton carries out an amusing impersonation of the Queen, whom she met for the second time a couple of weeks ago when invited to Buckingham Palace. \"Simon Clegg [the British Olympic chief] said, 'These are our gold medal winners,' pointing to us standing there with our medals around our necks. And the Queen said [in Pendleton's best imitation of the royal voice] 'Yes, I can see that.' She peered at me and asked, 'What do you do?' I said, 'I'm a track cyclist - like Chris Hoy.' I chucked in Chris's name - just in case.\"</p> <p>Her laugh, this time, is relaxed but there is an icily determined glint to her gaze. She might be set for four more years of pain and anguish but, before she cycles back into ordinary life, a new path stretches out in front of her, gleaming with enough gold to finally settle all the anxieties and doubts that make her such a relentlessly successful champion. \"Yeah,\" she suggests with a steely grin, \"a few more people might know who I am by the end of 2012.\"</p>",
  "<p>Talk of welfare reform usually triggers strong emotions and yesterday's revamp of incapacity benefit (IB), a tough policy legacy from the Thatcher era, is no exception. Ministers are routinely accused by campaigners and academics of failing to understand the deep-seated problems of chronically ill, disabled or mentally unstable people.</p> <p>On the other side, self-styled welfare radicals such as Labour's Frank Field (not to mention Tory newspapers) argue that another shakeup is about to fail to grasp the nettle of workshy claimants, organised by talented people who know how to beat the system and live off the state.</p> <p>Labour's great claim is to have taken the essentially passive system it inherited in 1997 - where claimants were paid with few questions asked, and left to rot quietly - and turned it into a proactive one. What started with Gordon Brown's New Deal for the long-term and (later) young unemployed is working its way through the system via Brownite slogans such as \"Something for something\".</p> <p>Yesterday's reform, the fruit of last year's legislation, emerged from a cross-party consensus in which the predicted leftwing revolt failed to materialise. Loyalists even say poverty lobbyists are basically onside. What the change does is to abolish IB, currently claimed by 2.6 million people, and replace it with a two-tier employment and support allowance (ESA) in which all claimants will be paid the same basic \u00a360.50 a week as the jobseeker's allowance (JSA). Those deemed by a doctor (not their own GP) to be work-incapable will get a higher level of allowance. </p> <p>Some \"customers\" - as the jargon now has it - will be fast-tracked to the higher payment, including \"those with a terminal illness\", James Purnell's Department for Work and Pensions guidelines dryly explains. But those who can do some work will receive an employment component only on condition that they take part in employability schemes. Conditionality on a non-means-tested benefit is new.</p> <p>This is sensitive territory. Whenever critics raise problems, ministers such as Jonathan Shaw, who took over the disability brief in last month's reshuffle, reply: \"So you want us to do nothing?\" Most people want to work; it is the best way out of poverty and ill-health, they say.</p> <p>Quite right too, but personal support is crucial. The Access to Work budget can provide physical or emotional support to get people working (taxis to work for a blind person or a signer for the deaf), support which may extend to employers who can't afford it or fear commitment to those with \"fluctuating [mental] conditions\".</p> <p>Optimists hope to cut the stubborn IB/ESA roll - partly the legacy of Thatcher's shakeout of workers in old industries, but increasingly made up of stressed women with mental health problems too - by up to a million. Pessimists, including Durham University researcher Dr Clare Bambra, warn that multiple issues are at work, including poverty and a tendency to disguise mental problems as physical.</p> <p>They fear punitive tabloid language and money-saving motives, reinforced by coercion, all based on slender evidence. Nonsense, reply the loyalists. Is the glass half full or half empty?</p>",
  "<p><strong>Prescott: The Class System and Me (BBC2)</strong> is a jolly plum pudding of a programme. There is far too much of it (another helping next week) but, if you rummage around, there are treasurable thrupenny bits to be found. I came across this entertaining exchange between John Prescott and Josie, a teenage tearaway. Prescott: \u201cI would say you\u2019re working class.\u201d Josie: \u201cBut I don\u2019t work!\u201d</p> <p>Prescott is 70 years old. Once upon a time everyone on Labour\u2019s frontbench looked like him. Ernie Bevin. Bessie Braddock. Particularly Bessie Braddock.</p> <p>Now he cuts a lonely figure. Except for his wife Pauline, who has been hiding her light under her big hair all these years. Pauline exploded out of obscurity in this documentary as if she had been shot, meticulously dressed, from a cannon.</p> <p>She is a genuinely nice woman if, like Marge Simpson, a little heavy handed with the Elnett. While John was shouting down the Earl of Onslow on the subject of class, Pauline leaned confidentially towards the camera. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what to say here but I feel I\u2019ve got to tell him. How do you tell a lord his zip\u2019s down? Shall I curtsey first?\u201d (Solutions to this teaser are earnestly solicited.) It only goes to show that, if you are obsessive, you miss what\u2019s under your nose.</p> <p>Pauline, who wore gloves to make smoked-salmon sandwiches, is very aware of appearances. \u201cJohn,\u201d she said \u201ccould you get my Royal Albert teapot from the top shelf?\u201d John was taken aback. \u201cDo what?\u201d \u201cWe always have it out, John, don\u2019t we?\u201d she said making a winding up gesture behind his back.</p> <p>\u201cI hope we don\u2019t come across like the Hamiltons,\u201d she said, as they swung together on their garden seat. \u201cI\u2019d die!\u201d</p> <p>I hope Pauline will be snapped up for TV instantly.</p> <p>Pauline is a royalist (he isn\u2019t). She would quite like to be Lady Prescott (he is thinking about it). She would have really liked to go to a state banquet when he was deputy prime minister (he mentioned it to Tony but no invitation arrived). Prescott said: \u201cI suppose she did the list. We never got close to the Blairs. We were not their set. Certainly we were not her set. Whatever Cherry might say about her class background, there weren\u2019t many of them going to Chequers.\u201d</p> <p>Tony and Cherry owed him a chicken dinner. I remember a Labour conference, where Prescott, a man transfigured on a platform, rallied the party behind Blair saying: \u201cHe put his head on the block for you!\u201d</p> <p>And the room rose to heartfelt oratory.</p> <p>The film is picaresque or, if you\u2019d rather, shapeless. Prescott wanders about the country buttonholing everyone he meets on the subject of class. They are as polite and bemused as if he were asking the way to Amarillo.</p> <p>Henley regatta (\u201cThey\u2019re the enemy!\u201d). Hay-on-Wye festival (\u201cFace to face with the middle class media!\u201d) And then Lewisham. Lewisham is working class with knobs on, where they haven\u2019t been nicked. Josie lives in Lewisham. She is as pale and thin as a chicken bone, but she reminds you of someone.</p> <p>\u201cYou got kicked out because education wasn\u2019t helping you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I got kicked out for violence.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn the playground?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, with the teacher\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe teacher!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe deputy \u2018ead. I fort he was going to \u2018it me so I started laying into him.\u201d</p> <p>And well merited. What school turns out, or even throws out, a girl so uneducated she doesn\u2019t know Gordon Brown is the prime minister and thinks the House of Commons is Buckingham Palace?</p> <p>Prescott took Josie and two comparatively speechless friends out for fried chicken and Coke, and then invited them to the Commons for double chocolate muffins and strawberries. They sat on the balcony and he talked about academic failure, the switchback of life and the importance of sticking with it.</p> <p>I can\u2019t think of another politician of his rank who could do that so un-selfconsciously. And Josie was interested. She said: \u201cI\u2019ve changed my lifestyle a little bit now. You didn\u2019t get here through sitting on your arse, did yer?\u201d It\u2019ll make an appropriate motto for Lord Prescott.</p>",
  "<p>A west African court has found Niger's government guilty of failing to protect a 12-year-old who was sold into slavery in a landmark decision that may offer hope to thousands of others who are enslaved in the region.</p> <p>Hadijatou Mani, who is now 24, had testified that she had been sold as a slave for around \u00a3323 against her mother's wishes and was regularly sexually abused and beaten for a decade. </p> <p>The justice arm of the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) also ordered the government to pay Mani the equivalent of \u00a312,310 in compensation. \"I am very happy with this decision,\" she told reporters yesterday outside the court in Niamey, Niger's capital. \"I feel that I am a human being like everyone else.\"</p> <p>Though the court dismissed a second part of the case, which accused the state of legitimising slavery by enforcing customary laws, the ruling is deeply embarrassing for Niger, where slave status is passed down through generations. </p> <p>The government claims to have done all it can to eliminate the practice, but local and international campaign groups say that more than 43,000 people remain in servitude there. Slavery also remains a problem in Mali, Mauritania and Sudan, according to Anti-Slavery International, the British group that helped bring the case to court.</p> <p>During proceedings that attracted national attention, with senior political figures attending court sessions, Mani said she had been sold to El Hadj Souleymane Naroua, a friend of the master of her mother, also a slave, in 1996. Her status was that of a wahiya or sex slave.</p> <p>Naroua, who was in his 60s and had seven other slaves, repeatedly raped Mani from the age of 13, and forced her to work long hours in his home and the fields without pay. Over the next 10 years she bore three of his children.</p> <p>Niger criminalised slavery in 2003, and two years later Mani was given a \"liberation certificate\". But her freedom proved short-lived. When she tried to marry a man of her own choosing Naroua claimed they were legally married.</p> <p>Though a local court found in her favour, allowing her to proceed with the wedding, the decision was reversed on appeal. Mani was arrested, charged with bigamy and jailed for two months.</p> <p>Despite the ban on slavery, Niger's courts have been reluctant to find in favour of victims in recent years. Mani chose instead to pursue her case through Ecowas, a body with 15 member states.</p> <p>The panel of judges from Mali, Senegal and Togo ruled that Mani had been a \"victim of slavery\" and held \"the Republic of Niger responsible for the inaction\" of its social and legal services.</p> <p>Mossi Boubacar, a lawyer for Niger's government, told Reuters that the government accepted the court's verdict.</p> <p>\"We are law-abiding and will respect the decision,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Law enforcement officers have foiled an alleged plot by two skinhead neo-Nazis who aimed to assassinate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> and kill 102 other people, according to court records unsealed today.</p> <p>Daniel Cowart, 20, and Paul Schlesselman, 18, were arrested in Tennessee on Wednesday and charged with making threats against a presidential candidate, conspiring to rob a gun store and possessing an unregistered firearm.</p> <p>They planned a \"killing spree\" in which they would target a predominantly black high school, killing 88 people and beheading 14 others, before trying to shoot Obama. They intended to wear white tuxedos and top hats during the assassination bid, said Jim Cavanaugh, the special agent in charge of the ATF's Nashville office.</p> <p>\"They said that would be their last, final act, that they would attempt to kill Senator Obama,\" he said. \"They didn't believe they would be able to do it, but that they would get killed trying.\"</p> <p>The 88 and 14 are believed to be coded references to Adolf Hitler and David Lane, a white supremacist who died in prison last year. H is the eighth letter of the alphabet, and 88 represents the phrase \"Heil Hitler,\" Cavanaugh said; 14 is a reference to a 14-word summary of Lane's views: \"We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.\"</p>",
  "<p>Business staked its claim to a greater role in school governance this month with a National Conference for Employee Governors. Delegates paid upwards of \u00a3417 each, expecting to hear Ed Balls give his vision for the future of governance. Unfortunately, the education secretary was otherwise engaged, and his place was filled by one of the newest members of the Department for Children, Schools and Families ministerial team, Sarah McCarthy-Fry, who was \"in listening mode\".</p> <p>The conference still made headlines, as it marked the launch of the University of Bath's School Governance Study (commissioned by Business in the Community), which highlighted a shortage of volunteers and backed calls for compulsory training for all new governors, chairs and clerks. </p> <p>The delegates also spoke with John Dunford, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. The event was not open to the media but Brian Stevens, one of the organisers and the chairman of FEdS consultancy, said the day drew out many ideas about the role of the business governor and the future of governance.</p> <p>Stevens, who runs an online support network for governors in companies such as Unilever and Rolls-Royce, outlined a proposal for a national network so that all governors who work in business and the public sector can be updated and advised on the latest legislation, get accredited online training, and pool knowledge and experience. He aims to pull in the expertise of other educational groups, such as the National Governors' Association and the National Association of Head Teachers.</p> <p>\"This could be very powerful, and the idea has already had a very positive response from the DCSF,\" said Stevens, who plans to run the service with Learning Pool, a Northern Ireland-based company that supplies e-learning materials. Funding has yet to be finalised, but it is likely to be subscription-based, probably with the support of employers. </p> <p>Stevens's plan has strong backing, but it is not surprising that the DCSF wants him to develop his plans - his network would do what the department's site, governornet, has failed to do for years. Its message board goes unmoderated for weeks and the site is very slow to update governors on news. </p> <p>A site for businesspeople misses out the retired, self-employed, unemployed and other volunteers. Stevens eventually hopes to open it to individuals. The government wants the business community to take more part in governance; businesspeople have the resources and enthusiasm to do more. The question is, to what extent should they run it?</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"mailto:education.governor@theguardian.com\">Education.governor@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Back in the old days, a monstrous behemoth sat centre-stage in classrooms across the land: the blackboard. A coiled sheet of continuous canvas, painted black, drawn across two parallel rollers and mounted on a sturdy oak frame, it was a black hole of attention, sucking the lives out of children and teachers alike. </p> <p>Blackboards had their uses. An imaginative science teacher might pull down violently on one of the metal runners to demonstrate friction, and many are the teachers who, faced with an unruly class, would threaten the ultimate sanction: scratching their nails down it.</p> <p>But a blackboard came with issues. It was difficult to write on it in any legible manner, and having to use chalk made a teacher's lot an intolerable circle of purgatory. Chalk got all over your favourite trousers, into your pores and up your nose. </p> <p>The fact that chalk dust embedded itself into the skin allowed teachers to coin a metaphor: teachers didn't work in schools, no, they toiled at the \"chalk face\". Many male teachers spend their lives in fear of their job being seen for the poncey pastime it is, and coining a term that compared reading a lovely story to a classroom of four-year-olds to the environment endured by miners masculinised our work. That we had cause to invent such a ludicrously self-pitying metaphor confirmed, for good, that we are fundamentally poncey. </p> <p>We cried poncey tears of relief when the blackboard was cast out upon the bonfire of progress, to be replaced by its more handsome cousin: the whiteboard. For two or three years we waltzed in a carefree way in front of the whiteboard, delighting in the freedoms it gave.</p> <p>No longer were we chained by the classroom's central device. It was possible to do so many things easily with the whiteboard. Whiteboards were so vast we could write to the end of the line; they lent themselves to colour, so we could draw maps or fairy castles; and crucially, readers of Education Guardian, you could illustrate thought on them in real time. I repeat. You. Could. Illustrate. Thought. In. Real. Time.</p> <p>You can't illustrate thought in real time anymore. The whiteboard too has been thrown on that same fire as its cousin. Every headteacher showing prospective parents around a school will proudly announce that each classroom has a Smart Board interactive whiteboard. These are the new behemoths of progress at the centre of the room - the old whiteboard reduced in size, or shifted to a fusty corner; sometimes split in two, so that two useless mini versions flank their nemesis, looking on apologetically and enviously as the projector buzzes. (Or, as is often the case, doesn't.)</p> <p>Like the blackboard, the Smart Board has its uses, although they are more limited than any headteacher would have you believe. They are great for showing photos, bringing a visual stimulus into lessons; and they show a mean DVD. But their place at the front of the class means every lesson must have a PowerPoint presentation, and a teacher's key tool is the memory stick on which they store their presentations. The Smart Board's central positioning destroys a teacher's ability to be spontaneous. You cannot come in any more with a couple of board markers and a handful of good ideas. \"Why have you not turned me on?\" screams the board. \"Why have you not sat up all evening downloading pictures that would make me look as if I had some vital use? You are lazy and should be sacked.\" </p> <p>Alexandre Borovik, a professor of pure maths at Manchester University, who remains loyal to the blackboard, has opinions about the \"snake-oil peddlers from staff development and teaching quality who cannot imagine an 'enhanced learning environment' without an all-singing, all-dancing PowerPoint presentation\".</p> <p>He speaks as a blackboard mathematician, but his points resonate with this whiteboard English teacher: \"A mathematics teacher is not just conveying information; he or she teaches to think mathematically, and teaches by example, in real time. It is crucially important to be in full control of timing and tempo of the narrative. If a lecture involves calculations, it is crucially important to let students feel the subtle play of rhythms, emphasise switches and branch points in the procedure, highlight recursion and reduction to simpler cases.\"</p> <p>If I am modelling sentence construction or the semicolon, drawing a map illustrating colonialism in Africa, or scribing arrows outlining connections between ideas, I want to be able to do it quickly: as quick as I think; as quick as I talk. I want to be able to teach with my whole body, use gesture, employ pause to illustrate nuance, become as one with the board; become, in those rare moments of flow, both dancer and dance. Now the board dictates that, rather than pirouette, twist and enthuse, I click a frigid button. </p> <p>They have their uses, Smart Boards, but they are a tool, not a teacher. Their central position gives them primacy. If you have a say, get yours put at the side of the room. Or ask for it to be given to someone more worthy; you'll make do and have your old whiteboard back.</p>",
  "<p>Autumn's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">market mayhem</a> has left the world's financial institutions nursing losses of $2.8tn, the Bank of England said today, as it called for fundamental reform of the global banking system to prevent a repeat of turmoil \"arguably\" unprecedented since the outbreak of the first world war.</p> <p>In its half-yearly health check of the City, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">the Bank</a> said tougher regulation and constraints on lending would be needed as policymakers sought to learn lessons from the mistakes that have led to a systemic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">crisis</a> unfolding over the past 15 months.</p> <p>The Bank's Financial Stability Report, which will be sent to every bank director in Britain, more than doubled the previous estimate of the potential losses faced by all financial institutions since the spring, but said that given time the actual losses could be pared by between a third and a half.</p> <p>The \u00a350bn pledged by the government had helped underpin the system, the Bank said, and would provide a breathing space for UK banks so that they did not have to sell assets at cut-price values immediately. The report also expressed cautious optimism about the effectiveness of the recent global bail-out plan. </p> <p>The Bank's estimate exceeds that made by the International Monetary Fund recently. The IMF concentrated on US institutions and did not include losses from the turmoil of recent weeks. Estimated paper losses from UK banks on mortgage-backed securities and corporate bonds are currently \u00a3122.6bn, the Bank report said.</p> <p>Gordon Brown insisted yesterday that it was right for the government to increase borrowing in order to fund investment to help the economy through tough times. But he moved to reassure markets that he would not preside over a reckless increase in borrowing during the recession and said he would reduce it as a proportion of GDP once the economy picks up.</p> <p>Paving the way for an expected abandonment of the tight fiscal rules he established as chancellor, Brown said: \"The responsible course of government is to invest at this time to speed up the economic activity. As economic activity rises, as tax revenues recover, then you would want borrowing to be a lower share of your national income. But the responsible course at the moment is to use the investments that are necessary, and to continue them, and to help people through very difficult times. </p> <p>\"I think that's a very fundamental part of what we are doing.\"</p> <p>In another turbulent day yesterday on global markets, there were hefty falls in Asian stockmarkets and a fresh fall in the pound. Japan's Nikkei index closed down more than 6% at a 26-year-low of 7162.9. London's FTSE 100 recovered from an early fall of more than 200 points to close 30 points lower at 3852.6, while the Dow Jones closed down 2.42% at 8,175.77.</p> <p>Brown and Peter Mandelson, the business secretary, served notice that Britain should brace itself for a downturn when they both warned about rising unemployment. Brown said: \"I can't promise people that we will keep them in their last job if it becomes economically redundant. But we can promise people that we will help them into their next job.\"</p> <p>Mandelson was more blunt as he warned of the impact of the recession. \"We are facing an unparalleled financial crisis,\" he said during a visit to Moscow. \"I don't think yet people have realised what the impact is going to be on our real economy.\"</p> <p>The Tories intensified their attacks on the government by depicting Brown as not a man with a plan but a man with an overdraft.</p> <p>Responding to Brown's remarks, George Osborne, shadow chancellor, said: \"What they are talking about is borrowing out of necessity, not out of virtue. Gordon Brown is a man with an overdraft, not a man with a plan. He is being forced into this borrowing. He presents it as a strategy but it is actually a consequence of his great failure that borrowing is already out of control before we even get into the worst of the economic circumstances that we are in.\" </p> <p>Brown was speaking as the Treasury finalised plans to rewrite the fiscal rules which have governed his approach to the economy over the past decade. Alistair Darling will use his pre-budget report next month to say that it is time for a more flexible approach in the new economic cycle, which started in 2006-07.</p> <p>The previous FSR in April envisaged a gradual recovery in global markets and the Bank was careful today not to sound the all-clear despite the coordinated action in Britain, the US and the eurozone this month to recapitalise banks and provide extra liquidity to markets. \"In recent weeks, the global banking system has arguably undergone its biggest episode of instability since the start of the first world war,\" it said.</p> <p>Sir John Gieve, the Bank's deputy governor for financial stability, added: \"With a global economic downturn under way, the financial system remains under strain. But it is better placed as a result of the exceptional package of capital, guaranteed funding and liquidity support. That is helping to underpin the banking system both directly and by demonstrating the authorities' determination to do whatever is needed to restore confidence.</p> <p>\"Looking further ahead, we need a fundamental rethink of how to manage systemic risk internationally. We need to establish stronger restraints on the build-up of risks in the financial system over the cycle with the dangers they bring to the wider economy.</p> <p>\"That means not just increasing capital and liquidity requirements for individual institutions but relating them to the cyclical growth of risk in the system more broadly. Counter-cyclical policy of that sort should complement regulation of companies and broader macroeconomic policy.\"</p> <p>The Bank believes that the capital injection from the taxpayer will also prevent banks from slashing their lending too aggressively over the coming months, relieving the recessionary pressure on the economy.</p> <p>Figures released yesterday, however, from financial data provider Moneyfacts showed banks were failing to pass on interest rate cuts to mortgage borrowers despite making severe cuts in savings rates. It said most institutions had already passed on the last half-point base rate cut to savers while holding back on cuts in home loan interest rates.</p> <p>\"Some providers are using the base rate cut as a way of increasing their margin for risk, by not passing on the full cut to mortgage customers but passing the cut on in full to savings customers,\" it said. </p> <p>A separate study last week marked a new low in the number of mortgage products available. </p> <p>Concerns at widespread job losses across the finance sector prompted unions to demand a \"social contract\" to protect jobs. Derek Simpson, Unite's joint general secretary, said: \"Workers in the financial services are facing insecurity as the world is gripped by economic turmoil. The Unite 'social contract' sets out the principles which employees expect the government and finance companies to now sign up to.</p> <p>\"Unite is calling for the protection of jobs, pensions, the end to short-term remuneration policies and an overhaul of the regulatory structures in the financial services sector. There must be a recognition of the importance of employment in the financial services sector, as many communities now depend on the sector since being decimated by the collapse of the manufacturing industry. </p> <p>\"Workers in the financial services industry are not the culprits of the credit crunch and we are not prepared to allow them to become the victims. The taxpayer must now get firm assurances that the financial lifeline extended to these large organisations will be used to protect jobs and the public. It is not acceptable for the government to socialise the risk without allowing the wider society to capitalise on the rewards in the finance industry.\"</p> <h2>How much is that?</h2> <p>The Bank of England may have put the paper cost of the global crisis at a staggering $2.8 trillion, but how does one come to grips with such a sum? Think of it like this: it could pay for<strong> 46 bail-outs</strong> of the kind the Treasury handed to the banks RBS, HBOS group and Lloyds TSB; or pay off the last quarter's<strong> public debt</strong> <strong>45</strong> <strong>times.</strong> It is more than <strong>three times the sum of UK annual public spending</strong>, and also equivalent to the wealth of<strong> 100 Oleg Deripaskas</strong> - before the credit crunch anyway. It's equal to <strong>138m bottles of 1947 Petrus Pomerol, </strong>the bankers' favourite vintage; or, if it's your turn in the coffee round, <strong>773bn lattes</strong> - nearly 13,000 each for every UK citizen.</p>",
  "<p>Books about medicine for the lay public have a long history. In the 18th century, the staple of many middle-class households, with a hallowed place next to the family bible, was Domestic Medicine: Or, a Treatise of the Prevention and Cure of Diseases By Regimen and Simple Medicines; while 1930s housewives relied on The Family Physician: A Modern and Up-to-Date Work on Domestic Ailments. </p> <p>More recently, there's no doubt that the internet has vastly broadened our knowledge of health.

A key feature are the 60-odd flow charts which, with detailed questions about symptoms, can help you assess the likely cause and decide whether you need medical help. The language is plain, the tone sympathetic and straightforward; the only reservation being that it is so all-encompassing as to be a bit daunting. There's also the BMA's considerably slimmer Family Doctor Home Adviser (\u00a314.99), a quick reference guide to symptoms and how to analyse them, with more of those symptom flow charts.</p> <p><strong>The Merck Manual of Medical Information - Home Edition (Pocket Books, \u00a314.99) </strong></p> <p>Merck is the US drug company that publishes what was originally known as the Merck Manual of the Materia Medica - a classic text for physicians, which has now been translated into (relatively) plain language for the general public, and claims to cover every known medical problem. The pharma industry isn't a source one would normally associate with independent information for patients, but this is a trustworthy and comprehensive volume. With dense text and pages so thin they rustle, this is not a publication one might immediately grab while nursing a feverish child in the middle of the night, but it's a respectable home reference, in its way. Bear in mind that it's published primarily for the US market, so has US spelling, and US figures on incidence. There's a fascinating section on understanding medical terminology (did you know that the prefix procto means anus?).</p> <p><strong>Dr Miriam Stoppard's Family Health Guide (Dorling Kindersley, \u00a322.50) </strong></p> <p>From the medical writer and broadcaster, this is a straightforward, practical home reference, with the emphasis on how to maintain good health at all ages. There's a particularly useful questionnaire to find out if an elderly relative has Alzheimer's. There's also a quick reference guide to symptoms, and 16 chapters devoted to body systems. It is, however, more lifestyle oriented than most health handbooks, arguably at the expense of hard medical facts: for example, the section on abortion has little on what happens during the procedure - but useful advice on how to take care of yourself afterwards. </p> <p><strong>Dr Dawn's Health Check: Everything Your Family Doctor Doesn't Have Time to Tell You (Mitchell Beasley, \u00a314.99 </strong></p> <p>You may feel chary, as I do, of celebrity doctors, but Dr Dawn Harper is a practising GP who specialises in women's and family health and who has done quite a creditable job here. Although not comprehensive, this is a succinct and well-illustrated guide, with a practical approach to hundreds of conditions. I particularly liked the fact that she doesn't ignore common anxieties, such as worries about putting on weight if you give up smoking. The numerous \"myth buster\" boxes (\"I am fat because I have a slow metabolism/it's in my genes/it's due to my glands\") are also interesting. </p> <p><strong>The Family Guide to Complementary and Conventional Medicine (Dorling Kindersley, \u00a316.99) </strong></p> <p>If you sit on the fence when it comes to alternative and conventional medicine, this may be the book for you. Written by a qualified doctor, the guide looks at 101 </p> <p>conditions that, it says, \"benefit from an integrated approach\". It must be one of the few publications to list for each disorder both alternative and orthodox treatments on the same pages: thus the remedies for repetitive strain injury include painkillers, nutritional therapy, homeopathic salts, ergonomics, Alexander technique, yoga and stress management. </p> <p>There is sensible and necessary advice about when to see a doctor for treatment, and when to consult with a doctor before trying herbal medicines. We can't vouch for the science behind some of these treatments, though.</p> <h2>Further reading for the really keen ...</h2> <p><strong>First aid and home remedies</strong></p> <p>Pocket First Aid (Dorling Kindersley, \u00a35.99), from the British Red Cross and St John's Ambulance, has user-friendly step by step advice on how to deal with 70 common medical conditions and injuries and is a handy size to keep in the car or a first aid kit.</p> <p>Reader's Digest First Aid (Reader's Digest, \u00a38.99) has advice on common medical emergencies, using clear instructions and photos. There are useful warnings: I didn't know, for example, that you should never perform the Heimlich manoeuvre (an abdominal thrust to remove an obstruction to the airways) on anyone who isn't choking, since it can cause serious organ damage. There's also a flyleaf with advice about checks you should make while waiting for medical help, and space to write observation notes you can then hand over to the professionals.</p> <p>It's also worth considering a book of home remedies, if only as an antidote to more serious medical volumes. The Reader's Digest 1,001 Home Health Remedies (Reader's Digest, paperback, \u00a314.99) has some interesting suggestions, aside from the traditional lavender for insomnia and lemon for coughs: ever tried crushed aspirin to soften a corn or tennis balls to stop someone snoring? Most of this material is harmless and may be helpful, but it's not based on any scientific evidence that we know of. And some of the suggestions - such as to try ginkgo biloba for asthma - should certainly not replace orthodox medicine.</p> <p>Owning a good medical dictionary, isn't a bad idea; the Oxford Concise Medical Dictionary (OUP, \u00a310.99) is enough for home purposes. It covers all the important terms and concepts used in medicine, whether in anatomy, physiology, biochemistry or genetics. </p> <p>\u2022 Cherrill Hicks is senior patient information editor at BMJ Group, a subsidiary of the BMA.</p>",
  "<p>George W Bush took office in 2000 promising to be \"the education president\". A terrorist attack, two wars, a hurricane and a financial meltdown will probably guarantee that he is remembered for other things.</p> <p>But a lot has happened in US schools, and the two presidential candidates are likely to build on the Bush reforms and develop rather than destroy them.</p> <p>Alongside tax cuts, Bush's main domestic legislative claim to fame is perhaps the federal No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001. This mandated annual, standardised testing in reading and maths for ages nine to 13, followed by a single test during high school, devised and administered by the individual states, but requiring federal approval, as a condition for continued federal funding.</p> <p>There has been fierce debate about the law's success in raising standards, improving accountability and closing the gap between high and low achievers, but it is expected to be reauthorised by Congress next year - though probably with changes demanded by the new president.</p> <p>Democrat frontrunner Barack Obama's priorities in education are to increase nursery school access for toddlers and university access for school leavers, and to improve and better direct funding for NCLB, while bolstering good teachers with incentives.</p> <p>Republican John McCain's watchwords are competition and choice - he wants to give parents more power to choose where their children will study and more control over budgets for individual headteachers, while making it easier to sack poor teachers and close failing schools.</p> <p>Obama's biggest hurdle would be the economic crisis. He has pledged $18bn extra for the nation's 100,000 public sector schools, but many are dubious he can provide it. \"Big city school systems are going to have huge holes in their budgets and the real issue for local authorities is going to be bankruptcy - that threat is already there for Detroit, Baltimore, Oakland - others will follow,\" says Paul Hill, an education expert at the University of Washington.</p> <p>McCain's toughest obstacle would be getting laws unpopular with teacher unions and liberal legislators through a Democrat-controlled Congress. His quickest route to change would be to bypass mainstream school systems and feed money to the high-profile minority group of publicly funded but independently run charter schools, which he supports.</p> <p>\"Both parties know the public cares a lot about education, but the economy and the war are greater priorities,\" says Pedro Noguera, a professor of sociology at New York University's school of education, and an adviser to Obama.</p> <p>Bush pushed NCLB through Congress during the period of bipartisan cooperation forced on it by the attacks of September 11 2001. \"He will go down as the president who had the biggest impact on public education in history,\" says Noguera. \"Bush took a strategy he had implemented in Texas of using standardised annual testing of pupils to gauge schools and he put it through all states.\"</p> <p>But teachers up and down the country now complain that insufficient funding was put behind the legislation. And schools deemed to be failing are left to flail, while even good schools rail against the strictures of \"teaching to the test\". The unions witheringly call it \"one size fits all\" schooling. A review is in the air.</p> <p>Both Obama and McCain believe that teachers need closer scrutiny, but more intelligent assessment than mere test scores, and better individual incentives to stay in the profession and improve.</p> <p>Even Obama aspires to negotiate with very wary teacher unions on the subject of performance-related pay, rather than salaries being largely tied to seniority in a jobs-for-life culture. Washington and Denver, for example, are already experimenting with higher pay for higher productivity, coupled with less job security.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Noguera says, it is crucial for the new president to address high school dropout rates: up to half of pupils in the worst-performing states, particularly small southern states such as Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana, leave at 15 or 16 with no qualifications.</p> <p>The 50 states themselves have most control over their schools, of course, and there is a limit to how much the president is empowered to intervene. Obama or McCain would have to exert much change by simply shouting from their Pennsylvania Avenue pulpit, or via controversial legislation.</p> <p>But there is widespread agreement that change is needed. \"We still have a lot of students who are not proficient in basic reading and maths all the way through primary, middle and high school,\" says Caroline Hoxby, an education expert at the right-leaning Hoover Institution thinktank. \"We are the highest spending country in the world per pupil, but one of the worst performing industrialised countries in public sector education.\"</p> <p>The US does not have a national system of school inspectors, nor a significant exam at 16, like the GCSE. The new president must address the issue of accountability.</p> <p>NCLB set the target of 2014 for basic proficiency in reading, writing and maths for all American children. Around 11% of schools currently fall short and most experts agree there is no sign that the deadline can be met.</p> <p>\"I think Obama will focus on pre-school and higher education, and Congress will take the lead on the future of NCLB,\" says Tom Loveless, a senior fellow at the left-of-centre Brookings Institution thinktank.</p> <p>McCain wants to take the Washington district voucher programme, in which low-income parents are effectively given a credit note from taxpayers for the value of their child's education, which they can instead \"spend\" on a place for their child at a private or charter school, and spread it nationwide. \"But he would have to take that to a Democratic-controlled Congress and get it through the appropriations committee - so that's not going to happen,\" says Loveless.</p> <p>Educators' main fear, however, is that policymaking will be allowed to drift, while funding shrinks as the new president is busy firefighting the economy. Thus American standards will fall further behind.</p> <h2>'There is too much of the communist about Obama'</h2> <p>Opinion polls may have Barack Obama about to step into the White House, but The \"Sun Belt\" is Republican country and much of Arizona is staying loyal to its local maverick, John McCain. </p> <p>A quick show of hands in a classroom of 14- and 15-year-olds at Desert Vista high school, in the prosperous Ahwatukee Foothills suburb of Phoenix, echoes that. Fourteen hands go up for McCain, 11 for Obama and five are undecided. </p> <p>The students are in a Spanish class and their teacher, Shannon O'Hay, nods approvingly. She has already voted in early ballots - a firm Republican. \"Arizona is a freedom-for-work state, where you do not have to be part of a teaching union. I grew up in Chicago and studied in Wisconsin where it's all unionised and they have bad teachers they just cannot get rid of,\" she says.</p> <p>McCain's plans for more rigorous assessment of teachers and for weeding out poor ones more easily \"makes a lot of sense\" to O'Hay. Obama has pledged $18bn more funding for schools, including better incentives for teachers, while McCain says he will freeze spending.</p> <p>O'Hay would rather go without. \"Obama is trying to do too much with too little, and he will not be able to do it. There is too much of the communist about him for my liking, too,\" she says.</p> <p>The private homes around the school are large, all with swimming pools. Almost four-fifths of Desert Vista's 2,950 pupils are white, and fewer than 5% qualify for a free or reduced-rate lunch. Around 95% of pupils go on to higher education - three-quarters to full degree programmes.</p> <p>\"We have some divorced parents, but I would not call them single-parent families in the true sense - that only accounts for about 1% of our students,\" says the principal, Anna Battle. </p> <p>She is an Obama supporter but, in line with Arizona's mixed characteristics as a \"red\" state, with Republican senators but a Democrat, Janet Napolitano, as governor, she believes in bipartisanship. \"I like McCain's idea of greater competitiveness between schools. And I have no problem with greater accountability. But I do not like his voucher scheme, which takes resources away from the public sector; and I prefer Obama's holistic approach of helping all schools to improve,\" she says.</p> <p>Something Desert Vista and Hyde Park Academy in Chicago (see below) have in common is being located in states that are both bumping along the bottom of the US league tables of education spending. </p> <p>At the election, as well as voting for the American president, residents of Desert Vista's catchment will vote on proposals to give schools a larger slice of their local tax receipts - just to meet their everyday needs. This is in addition to ordinary taxpayer funding. Anything deemed \"extra\" at Desert Vista has to be paid for by parents directly. This includes \"buying sheet music for music classes, clay and paint for art classes, and paying to cover a teacher's overtime stipend if they come into school on a weekend or an evening to coach sport, the choir or run student clubs,\" says Victoria Wong, a manager from the local authority who travels from school to school sorting out finances. She complains of having had to send a bill for $1,200 a year to a family that has four children at the school, to charge them for \"extra\" activities. That includes school activity clubs, discretionary honours classes, and additional classes that give college credits. </p> <p>\"We have a deficit in Arizona and they are talking about cutting education budgets next year,\" she says.</p> <p>Student Rebecca Edmunds, 16, points out that the Thunder, the famous school marching band of which she is a member, \"did not have new uniforms last year\" and she is worried about a spending squeeze. Pupils have to supply their own exercise books and paper to work on.</p> <p>Rebecca's Republican-voting parents are comfortably off, however, and she is not too worried: \"I live right around here. It's a really nice, upper-middle-class neighbourhood.\" She wants to go to a local university, and then become a teacher.</p> <p>Many pupils talk of being in three-car families, and being taken on holiday to Europe.</p> <p>Amie Hickelt, a school guidance counsellor, supports McCain's big theme of small government: \"Education is so much more of a local issue and state issue, not a federal one. I want more fiscal responsibility given to headteachers, and more devolution of power.\"</p> <h2>'Eight years of Bush have stretched the resources'</h2> <p>Hyde Park Academy high school is, almost literally, in Barack Obama's back yard. The Democratic candidate lives less than a mile away to the north - a mile that becomes increasingly gentrified, while the mile to the south gets rougher with each block. \"We are 99% African-American, but we are still pretty diverse in terms of socio-economic status,\" says Thomas Trotter, headteacher of 1,975 pupils.</p> <p>Hyde Park is a typical school in Chicago's tough South Side. \"We have the same problems schools like ours have all over America - striving to be the safe haven in the community, trying to get parents more involved, pupils to take more responsibility, and the authorities to provide more resources,\" says Trotter. He thinks a handful of his teachers might vote Republican on November 4, but \"very few\".</p> <p>Hyde Park runs the international baccalaureate (IB) for around 200 of its most promising pupils, and 75% of all the students who graduate go on to college - whether it is a two-year \"junior\" college programme or a full degree course.</p> <p>The school also handles the consequences of 70% of its pupils living in one-parent families, 85% being eligible for subsidised or free lunches - denoting that they live close to or below the official poverty line - and at least 150 pupils being homeless and sleeping in shelters.</p> <p>\"Eight years of Bush have stretched the resources here unbelievably,\" says Jullanar Maalik, 28, who was a pupil at Hyde Park and has now taught here for seven years. \"It wears on you.\" </p> <p>Hyde Park has had to take in hundreds of academically struggling pupils from nearby schools that were closed under Bush's No Child Left Behind policy, as well as New Orleans refugees who fled Hurricane Katrina.</p> <p>Maalik complains that such challenges, and the heavy focus on testing, have sucked money from other needs. \"I would like to see more community and family involvement in schools - somehow weave it in, share the responsibility, more a case of 'No Family Left Behind',\" she says.</p> <p>Hyde Park strongly supports both candidates' pledges to improve teacher performance and retention. \"But McCain wants to give parents more choice of schools, while I feel Obama wants to focus on helping every school,\" says Daniel Mullins, a biology and biochemistry teacher.</p> <p>McCain favours giving parents in state schools vouchers worth the value of their child's education, which they can redeem for a place at a private or charter school. \"That would devalue teachers in the public sector and leave many schools as struggling shells,\" warns Maalik.</p> <p>Pupils are enthused by their famous neighbour, but are also nervous. \"Obama needs to watch out - someone will try to kill him before we get our first black president into the White House,\" says 15-year-old D'Shay Dorsey. She lives with her younger brother and mother, who uses food stamps to feed the family.</p> <p>\"I hope that he wins because it will be easier for people to get jobs, and drug-dealing and gun violence around here will go down - people get shot every day around my house,\" says D'Shay.</p> <p>Student Vantryce Scott, attending an IB class, notes that the buses and streets have become cleaner and police patrols more numerous in the area since Obama became the nominee.</p> <p>Some teachers and pupils met Obama about five years ago when he was a community organiser. \"My students were able but apathetic,\" says English teacher Cassiette West Williams. \"Obama inspired many of them not to drop out of school.\" </p> <p>As the pupils pour out of the school, police are on hand to deal with any trouble. The headteacher strides up and down, sending students on their way. Trotter, who used to play basketball against Michelle Obama's brother, works 12-hour days to keep his school improving and is \"optimistic\" Obama will win.</p> <p>He sums up: \"He not only has a plan to move America forward, he will take a whole blemish off our history, all the way back to slavery.\"</p> <h2>Who decides what</h2> <p>\u2022 America's 100,000 public sector schools receive, on average, just 8% of their budget from the federal government, with the rest provided by state and local district funding.</p> <p>\u2022 Local school districts decide on teacher hiring, curriculum content and attendance rules.</p> <p>\u2022 States certify teachers and run standardised tests and exams. The federal government oversees the reading and maths tests required by No Child Left Behind.</p> <p>\u2022 Presidents wishing to exert education policy changes at state level have two main avenues: diplomatic pressure or federal legislation.</p> <p>\u2022 In the event of an Obama victory, states or districts wishing to adopt McCain's education ideas can do so, and vice versa.</p>",
  "<p>Apologies to anyone who might think I am belittling the enormity of the global economic turmoil and the likely recession that will follow, but can it tell us anything about policy and practice in the education sector? I pose the question because for the past two decades, large chunks of education policy have been concerned with developing a public sector version of \"the market\" and trying to adopt the \"innovation and flexibility\" of the private sector. </p> <p>In fact, much of the political debate around the whole of public sector reform centres on how far market principles can be adopted. At one extreme are those who believe that having anything to do with the private sector will lead to the commercialisation of schools and the betrayal of childhood, and at the other end are those who think any central control inhibits progress. There is no doubt that breaking down the lack of transparency and the inward-looking culture that used to be the hallmark of the public sector has brought great benefit. So too have the partnerships forged with parts of the private sector; from mentoring and work-based learning to providing services and developing diplomas. We offer our children a better deal because we've shifted away from the state paternalism of the old system. </p> <p>How much further can schools be pushed towards adopting market principles? It is still a matter of debate and we've not yet reached a settled position. Political parties might be beating a hasty retreat from espousing deregulation and untrammelled freedom as saviours of the City, but the same concepts, albeit to a much lesser degree, still weave their way through education debates. Indeed, the original concept of the academies programme - and the city technology colleges that preceded it - was built on the assumed benefits of deregulation and private sector management. Academies were at one time intended to be schools that embedded market principles: independence from the state, liberation from the customs and practices of their neighbouring schools, and greater freedoms for their leaders and sponsors. </p> <p>In this case, the policy has developed and the reality is somewhat different, so it's worth reflecting on the shift. The relationship that academies now have with central government is closer to that which any other school has with its local authority. Academies are monitored more carefully than any other part of the school system. Their success, to a large extent, derives from their ability to recruit outstanding school leaders and teachers and from the quality of the relationships they make with their sponsors and other partners. So, I'd beware the calls of the Conservatives and others who see the original academies model as the way forward and remind them that unfettered freedom doesn't have a good track record. </p> <p>This issue of the right balance between freedom and accountability is at the core of how we run public services and will become more important in any sector in which the public have an interest. Ironically, in the very same week that we were bemoaning the minimalist inspection accorded the financial sector, the government announced a move away from the over-prescriptive accountability framework in schools with an end to the key stage 3 tests. Regulation frameworks were under attack from both ends. </p> <p>Maybe there are some lessons to learn. Those who would have us import the extremes of market principles into the education service should reflect on what can happen when competition is allowed to run unchecked. Perhaps more important, we've been reminded that the way we hold organisations to account will influence how they behave. Throwing away all external controls can hide failure on a large scale, but ignoring the need to constantly review how accountability mechanisms are influencing behaviour can distort the way that any organisation works.</p> <p>\u2022 Estelle Morris is pro vice-chancellor of the University of Sunderland</p>",
  "<p>The BBC was forced to formally apologise yesterday to the actor Andrew Sachs over a series of \"offensive\" prank phone calls made by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/russell-brand\">Russell Brand</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/jonathan-ross\">Jonathan Ross</a> to the 78-year-old former Fawlty Towers star.</p> <p>The pre-recorded exchange, in which the pair left a series of messages on the actor's answerphone claiming that Brand had slept with his granddaughter, was broadcast on a late-night Radio 2 show on October 18. Yesterday the BBC confirmed it had received a letter of complaint from the actor's agent and \"would like to sincerely apologise to Mr Sachs for the offence caused\".</p> <p>A spokeswoman added: \"We recognise that some of the content broadcast was unacceptable and offensive. We are reviewing how this came about and are responding to Mr Sachs personally.\"</p> <p>The BBC, which by last night had received 1,587 complaints about the incident, apologised to listeners \"for any offence caused\". Ross said yesterday that he had also apologised to Sachs and his family privately. The offending 10-minute segment occurred when Sachs failed to answer his phone and, as the pair left a message, Ross blurted out: \"He fucked your granddaughter.\"</p> <p>The pair then joked that Sachs, best known for playing Manuel in Fawlty Towers, might kill himself and recorded a spoof song that included the line: \"I said some things I didn't of oughta, like I had sex with your granddaughter. But it was consensual and she wasn't menstrual, it was consensual lovely sex.\" The BBC yesterday confirmed the extract had been vetted by a \"senior editorial figure\" before it was aired, but would not say who.</p> <p>If Sachs is not satisfied with the BBC's apology, he can request a further response. If he is still not satisfied, the matter can be referred to the editorial complaints unit and, if its findings are deemed unsatisfactory, an appeal made to the BBC Trust.</p> <p>On Saturday night Brand, aware the Mail on Sunday was due to put the story on its front page, apologised but added that \"it was quite funny\". Before Sunday, the BBC had received just two complaints.</p> <p>He then went on to attack the Daily Mail, referring to the fact that it was accused of \"tacitly supporting Adolf Hitler when he took charge of the Third Reich\" in the 1930s. \"It's up to you the listener to decide which is worse. Offending Manuel, for which I apologise, or is it worse to tacitly support the death of millions?\" he said.</p> <p>Brand, one of a number of younger DJs introduced to Radio 2 as it has been overhauled in recent years, caused a storm in the US earlier this year when he referred to George Bush as a \"retard\" while hosting the MTV awards.</p> <p>The involvement of Ross, whose reported \u00a36m-a-year contract will shortly be due for renewal and has become a lightning rod for the BBC's critics, gave the story added impetus. A BBC Trust review earlier this year found the corporation was not paying over the odds for its top stars or driving up salaries.</p> <p>Meanwhile, questions were being asked internally about the time it has taken the BBC to apologise, with some questioning whether lessons had been learned from past PR disasters.</p> <p>Last year, a BBC1 press launch spiralled out of control after a misleadingly edited clip of the Queen was claimed to show her storming out of a photoshoot when in fact she was entering the room.</p> <h2>Nuisance callers: The answerphone message</h2> <p><strong>Andrew Sachs' answerphone:</strong> \"Sorry I can't answer at the moment, but please call again or leave a message.

  "<p>Your interview with Richard Dawkins ('People say I'm strident', October 25) buys into the mistake that science and religion are at war. There are many scientists, some very eminent, on both sides of the theist-atheist divide. As pointed out by John Lennox in his book, God's Undertaker: Has Science Buried God?, the real issue concerning science is \"which world-view does science support: naturalism/atheism - the view that there is nothing but nature and the material world; or supernaturalism/theism - the view that there is a God?\".</p> <p>Science cannot decide between these world-views, but scientists on both sides believe that science supports their own faith (for atheism is also a faith - as even Dawkins says, you cannot prove there is no God). Lennox argues clearly that science is consistent with theism - for one thing it gives an explanation for the rational intelligibility of the universe, without which science cannot begin.</p> <p>Of course, theism is a broad term and raises the issue of which God - as noted by Dawkins in the debate in Oxford last Tuesday between him and Lennox. And there are some aspects of religion - for example, unthinking blind faith and fanaticism - that Dawkins, along with Christian believers who are true to Christ's teaching, deplore. But it is unscientific to generalise from some to all.<br><strong>Nigel Cutland</strong><br>Professor of mathematics, University of York</p> <p>I was somewhat surprised to read that Richard Dawkins believes that \"science may be losing its war with religion\". The evidence suggests that the number of those who hold faith-based beliefs and/or worship is declining. A Guardian poll of December 2006 registered 66% stating they were not religious and a Mori poll published just before that showed for the first time a majority who did not believe in God (51%). </p> <p>The British Humanist Association has doubled its membership in three years. A large number of books opposed to religion have been published in the past three years, with massive sales for Christopher Hitchens' excellent God is Not Great and Sam Harris's The End of Faith, as well as Dawkins's The God Delusion.</p> <p>On a personal level, going into schools on behalf of the North East Humanists and working with pupils aged 11 to 19 has shown strong majorities rejecting religion and adopting a humanist viewpoint. The numbers reflect a number of polls taken in the past 10 years showing 40-60% who do not believe in a personal God. Losing the battle? Hardly.<br><strong>John Severs</strong><br>Durham</p> <p>Atheists tend to believe in matter only; and it follows that behaviour was, and is, predetermined by a swishing set of neurochemical reactions. From there it's a short hop to believing the Holocaust was disagreeable, but not wrong. Any reasonable man would see a problem with this. </p> <p>In English civil law \"the reasonable man\" is defined as \"the man on the Clapham omnibus\". Guardian readers should stick with this sort of man for metaphysical counsel; and avoid Dawkins battle-bus, however high he might try to talk up the odds that \"there probably isn't a God\". <br><strong>Rob Siddall</strong><br>Redhill, Surrey</p> <p>I don't believe in the God whose existence Dawkins denies either - nor do most people in the British Christian churches. Why doesn't he acknowledge, or have a serious discussion with, a more reasoned and credible Christianity than the fundamentalism he is rightly unhappy about?<br><strong>Rev Neil Richardson</strong><br>Orleton, Herefordshire</p> <p>Simon Hoggart quotes Dawkins as equating a belief in a teapot in orbit round the sun with a belief in God (A g&amp;t, what a tonic it has been, October 25). In The God Delusion, Dawkins acknowledges that this comparison was due originally to Bertrand Russell. Both of them make a simple error: there is nothing to lead any person to postulate a teapot circling the sun, but look around - all we see came from somewhere and although such a thought does nothing to prove the existence of a creator, it makes such a being worthy of consideration.<br><strong>Mike Ruddock</strong><br>Banbury, Oxfordshire</p>",
  "<p>With 14 years' experience running out-of-school activities for children and glowing reports from parents, the education charity Kids' City felt sure it was offering a good service. So why was it so difficult to scrape more than a \"satisfactory\" in an Ofsted inspection? And why were some of its most successful breakfast and after-school clubs judged to be failing? </p> <p>The chief executive, Jackie Nunns, was convinced the inspection process itself was to blame. It just wasn't appropriate for out-of-school settings, she believed. She decided to launch an inspection of Ofsted.</p> <p>Kids' City has now developed its own inspection framework. Staff can grade inspectors from \"inadequate\" to \"outstanding\" on issues ranging from whether they were courteous to whether they were suitably experienced to assess the setting. At the end of each inspection, the results will be collated in a report and delivered to Ofsted. \"The approach may seem a bit tongue in cheek,\" says Nunns. \"But we are completely serious in our concerns.\" </p> <p><strong>Specific needs</strong></p> <p>Her biggest concern is that inspectors do not take into account the specific needs of out-of-hours services. Unlike school or nursery settings, where at least three days' notice is given, inspectors can swoop on breakfast and after-school clubs completely unannounced. </p> <p>With many clubs running on a skeleton staff (one play worker to eight children is usual) the manager is not always able to stop what they are doing to locate paperwork or answer inspectors' questions. </p> <p>And because many clubs use \"borrowed\" premises (usually schools), many play workers are not in control of their environment. Nunns cites an example of a club that was failed because the school gate had been left open to let teachers out. Another failure came because toilet paper was located outside toilet cubicles (something the \"host\" school insisted on). \"It is not uncommon to arrive at a school only to be told you can't use the room you were planning to,\" says play manager Catherine Savoury, who runs an after-school club in south London. \"More often than not, you're starting on the back foot. The last thing you need is an inspector demanding to see your policy documents.\" </p> <p>Even 24 hours' notice of an inspection would make all the difference for breakfast and after-school clubs, says Nunns. \"At least we could organise an extra member of staff, to free up the play manager to spend time with the inspector and make sure any relevant paperwork was to hand. Ofsted argues that unannounced inspections allow them to see settings running normally, but staff say it's not 'normal' for play managers to have an inspector demanding information while they are trying to do their job.\" </p> <p>At the end of an inspection, verbal feedback is given, but play managers rarely have a \"right to reply\" says Nunns. Reports are published on the web within 20 days. Savoury is still smarting from comments published about her. \"We got the report back and it said 'the play manager is unsuitable'. I was devastated. We eventually found out it was because they claimed not to have received the 'fit person' form play workers have to submit about their health. I sorted it out, but they still refused to remove the comments. We had to send the report to parents with a letter explaining what had happened. Fortunately the parents were supportive. One - a barrister - thought it might be defamation and offered to look into it for me. But I decided to drop it.\" </p> <p><strong>'Wraparound' care pledge</strong></p> <p>The government has pledged that by 2010 all schools will be offering \"wraparound\" care from 8am-6pm, but many inspectors lack knowledge and experience of out-of-hours care. \"Many seem to be from an early years background,\" says Anne Longfield, chief executive of 4Children, a national charity for children and young people. \"Inspectors need to understand that out-of-hours provision is more self-directed than nursery. It's more about facilitating than teaching. Yes, there needs to be a range of activities on offer, but after a busy school day, some children want to flop around or read or chat with friends. It's a different context to the classroom, much freer, much more informal.\" </p> <p>Ofsted remains unapologetic about its approach. A spokesperson said: \"Ofsted's first concern is with the outcomes for children attending these settings. Inspectors will base their professional judgments on the overarching principle of 'what is it like for a child here'? We inspect in this way so that we can see settings running normally. We do not expect providers to make special preparations for inspection.\"</p> <p>In the past, out-of-school providers were inspected by local authorities, something Nunns feels was much more useful. \"Because they were local, as well as looking at how you were doing, they could offer practical advice, ideas and contacts. Now there is no opportunity to celebrate the things which are being done well. To the play managers, it feels as if inspectors are just there to nitpick, not to help you improve your service.\"</p>",
  "<p>About the only US comment on a special forces raid that killed at least seven people in a Syrian village close to the Iraqi border on Sunday came yesterday from an unnamed military official in Washington. He said that since Syria had been unable to shut down the so-called rat lines, the network of foreign fighters moving into Iraq, US forces would take matters into their own hands. But that is precisely the problem. </p> <p>Syria's sovereignty is a weak enough concept from whichever border it is viewed - from Israel, whose fighters bombed a nuclear reactor under construction in the desert, or from Iran, whose missiles transit the country bound for Hizbullah in Lebanon. A withdrawal of US combat troops from Iraq will depend on securing Iraq's borders, with the assistance of its neighbours. Hence the policy pursued in both France and Britain of encouraging Damascus back into the diplomatic fold, of which yesterday's talks in London between David Miliband and his Syrian counterpart were a part. It has also been the policy of the caretaker Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert to pursue Turkish-mediated talks with Syria on the return of the Golan Heights. Unless Washington believed that a raid inside Syria would spur Damascus into taking action against foreign jihadis, or they thought the target was too important to miss, then the attack was another sign of a US administration which shoots first and thinks later.</p> <p>Not only long-term goals such as withdrawal are damaged. Short-term objectives - among them the need to strike a deal with Baghdad over the legal status of US forces in Iraq by the end of the year - are also affected. For Shia politicians sensitive to the degree of sovereignty their government will exercise as it enters an election year, the US raid into Syria bears a striking resemblance to an operation they carried out recently in Anbar province. A senior member of the main Sunni party was killed in a province which the US had ostensibly handed over to the Iraqi authorities. If America ignores Syria's borders, to what extent will they honour Iraq's sovereignty? </p> <p>A government seeking to encourage a regional solution should also bear in mind what could happen in Israel. The Likud leader, Binyamin Netanyahu, said yesterday in the Knesset that if he became prime minister, Israel would keep the Golan Heights, large parts of the West Bank and all of Jerusalem - each of which would be enough to sink a deal with the Palestinians. Although his rival Tzipi Livni gained in the polls by refusing to cut a deal with the ultra-orthodox party, the Shas, the election will be close. The hardline Likud leader has gained in popularity since Hamas seized power in Gaza and could well be returned to power.</p>",
  "<p>Simon Jenkins's article on assisted dying contains so many misconceptions that it is difficult to know where to begin in refuting them (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/22/assisted-euthanasia-religion-suicide-prosecution\">Denial of the right to die is sheer religious primitivism, October 22</a>). </p> <p>First, it is nonsense that \"one third of all registered deaths are caused by morphine overdose\". Those of us who practise end-of-life medicine know the evidence that morphine, used correctly, is a very effective drug which can actually extend life by controlling pain and breathlessness and avoiding the exhaustion of unrelieved symptoms. Prescribing morphine properly is humane, compassionate and safe - it does not kill. Just because there is a last dose of a drug - or a last cup of tea - does not mean that either killed the patient dying of advanced disease.</p> <p>Jenkins also refers to the removal of life support, which he describes as \"premeditated acts by medical staff\". Again, he has misunderstood. Doctors regularly discontinue futile treatment. But they don't do it in order to end a patient's life: they are simply recognising that death cannot be prevented by treatment. Jenkins needs to understand that end-of-life decisions, which are made every day by doctors, aren't the same thing as ending-life decisions. So, don't worry, it's perfectly safe to go into hospital.</p> <p>Jenkins seems convinced by the Oregon law on assisted suicide and its so-called safeguards. He obviously hasn't seen the recent report in the BMJ by independent Oregon-based researchers which records that, in a recent sample of legal assisted suicides, one in six of those who took their own lives were suffering from depression which had not been picked up by their doctors. The report concludes \"the current practice of the Death With Dignity Act in Oregon may not adequately protect all mentally ill patients\".</p> <p>This conclusion is hardly surprising when you consider that in the last 10 years only one in 10 of those who committed suicide by lethal prescription had received a psychiatric evaluation. And yet it was such an Oregon-style \"safeguard\" that was proposed by the \"assisted dying\" lobby for Britain two years ago. Parliament had the sense to reject it by a large majority and after an eight-hour debate, in which (contrary to Mr Jenkins's sneers about \"religious primitivism\") religion was scarcely mentioned.</p> <p>We are told that \"the law is clearly unfit for purpose\" because there have been no prosecutions to date of anyone who has accompanied an intending suicide to Switzerland. This is a common misunderstanding of how the law works. We have blanket bans on activities like killing, stealing and injuring: the law places responsibility with the police, the CPS and the courts to assess each case on its merits and to decide whether a prosecution is warranted and, in the event of a conviction, what the appropriate penalty should be. Would Jenkins feel happier if there were more prosecutions? Or would he then tell us that the law was heartless?</p> <p>Daniel James' suicide is far too tragic to be used in points scoring. But is Simon Jenkins seriously suggesting that we should have an \"assisted dying\" law to facilitate such tragic events in this country?</p> <p>\u2022 Baroness (Ilora) Finlay is professor of palliative medicine at Cardiff University and a former president of the Royal Society of Medicine finlayi@parliament.uk</p>",
  "<p>It is 1491. In the city surrounding the Alhambra in southern Spain there is the smell of change and gunpowder in the air. The only surviving Muslim stronghold is under pressure from the crusades of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand. Amid the turmoil, ordinary people are trying to scrape a living and get enough to eat. Among them are the dreamy, self-dramatising Rabia and her Jewish friend, Luis, a brilliant polyglot and engineer who doesn't know that he has just invented a monster that will be used against his city.</p> <p>There's no shortage of children's theatre, but mostly they are stage adaptations of successful children's books. The new, original play is a rare thing; even rarer is a play for children that is as bold and ambitious as this one by Carl Miller. Like a Howard Barker history play for kids (and I mean that as a compliment), Red Fortress charts the attempts of Rabia and Luis to save their city with the help of dispossessed Christian teenager Iago, against a background of religious fundamentalism, the battle of science against superstition, and raging teenage hormones. The breadth of it is dazzling and it boasts a network of references, whether it is a Mother Courage-style jongleur pulling her cart across the burning landscape, Christopher Columbus as a standup turn, or the sly little suggestion about where Shakespeare may have found the name Iago for Othello.</p> <p>It's not perfect by any means. Tony Graham's production always looks beautiful with its orange and cinnamon hues. But it is far too leisurely and doesn't always keep all the balls - ideas, character, history and storytelling - up in the air. The story sometimes gets lost amid the changing geography and welter of ideas, and the sprawling script needs cuts and refocusing to aid clarity. But this is brave work and exactly what the Unicorn should be doing, because it doesn't sell audiences short, either emotionally or intellectually. </p> <p>It excavates the children's emotional hinterlands with a love triangle that includes a gay subtext handled with a light touch, and it constantly poses questions about history. Whose story does it tell? Who writes it? Why are the poor always on the losing side? Who makes the bargains and what effect do those deals have on the great mess of humanity as it struggles to survive?</p>",
  "<p>Measures to ban foreign-born \"preachers of hate\" and other violent extremists from Britain are to be outlined by Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, today.</p> <p>She is expected to strengthen the rules on excluding from Britain those who are \"suspected of stirring up tensions\". The move will cover anti-abortionists, animal rights extremists, neo-Nazis as well as extremist clerics.</p> <p>The burden of proof is to be placed on the individuals concerned by demanding that they refute accusations made against them by publicly denouncing or retracting their reported views. At present the Home Office has to provide evidence that the individual holds the views ascribed to them. Individuals may have to make a statement of their attachment to democratic values to prove their change of heart is genuine.</p> <p>Since 2005, 230 people have been banned on grounds of national security and for \"unacceptable types of behaviour\" which include fomenting or glorifying terrorism and inciting hatred. Of those, 79 were excluded for unacceptable behaviour.</p> <p>The most high-profile individuals to face exclusion orders include Omar Bakri Mohammed who was banned in the wake of the July 7 terror attacks in London and the Egypt-born cleric, Yusuf al-Qaradawi, banned by the Home Office this year after being described as a \"dangerous and divisive\" preacher of hate by David Cameron, the Tory leader.</p> <p>The Home Office anticipates that the new rules will see a larger number of people barred from Britain.</p> <p>The ban rests on the government's legal powers to tackle violent extremism and incitement to religious and racial hatred. It does not permit somebody to be banned for simply holding disagreeable political views but will apply to those who advocate illegal means to further them.</p> <p>Smith said yesterday the strengthened rules would give the Home Office the power to name individuals stopped from entering Britain. At present they are banned from naming those involved in individual cases who remain anonymous unless they choose to fight the ban and name themselves. This would also enable their names to be shared with other countries and placed on British port \"watchlists\" to ensure that any future visa application did not slip through the net.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesman said unless an individual could persuade the authorities that they were no longer involved in preaching hate, they would face a permanent ban.</p> <p>He said an individual who claimed to show that they had repudiated previous extremist views or actions would have to publicly retract them.</p> <p>\"Coming to Britain is a privilege and I don't want to extend that privilege to individuals who abuse our standards and values to undermine our way of life,\" Smith said yesterday.</p> <p>A MI5 report leaked to the Guardian this year on the current state of radicalisation and violent extremism in Britain noted that the influence of extremist clerics had \"moved into the background\" in recent years.</p> <h2>Not wanted?</h2> <p>In February, Muslim cleric <strong>Yusuf al-Qaradawi</strong> was refused a visa to enter the UK after comments surfaced in which he defended suicide attacks on Israelis. Qaradawi had been welcomed to London in 2004 by former London mayor Ken Livingstone. The ban provoked a furious response from the Muslim Council of Britain. </p> <p>A month later a member of Israel's rightwing Likud party was refused entry to the UK on the grounds his presence could provoke hatred, violence or terrorism. <strong>Moshe Feiglin</strong> had written strident articles in the Israeli press, including a piece disparaging Islam.</p> <p><strong>Omar Bakri Mohammed </strong>was banned from re-entering the UK from Lebanon in 2005 after the home secretary decided his presence was \"not conducive to the public good\". Mohammed, who had been granted political asylum, praised the 9/11 hijackers while head of the radical al-Muhajiroun group. </p> <p>A 15-year ban on the Nation of Islam leader, <strong>Louis Farrakhan,</strong> was lifted in 2001 by the high court. Dubbed a \"black racist\" by opponents for his inflammatory speeches criticising Jews and whites, Farrakhan had been banned since 1986. Successive home secretaries have argued his oratory could provoke public disorder.</p> <p>Although he has not been subject to a ban<strong>, Ibrahim Moussawi</strong>, the head of Hizbullah's propaganda wing, may fall within the scope of the new guidelines.

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-339025590\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Syria yesterday condemned the US for launching \"criminal and terrorist aggression\" on its soil, while the Iraqi government defended action against foreign jihadis amid warnings it might complicate plans for a controversial security agreement between Baghdad and Washington.</p> <p>Walid al-Muallem, Syria's foreign minister, used a visit to London to lambast the US for its \"cowboy politics\" and hinted that Sunday's raid was designed to halt Syria's gradually improving relations with the EU and Britain. Iran and Russia also condemned the US for aggravating tensions in the region.</p> <p>Syria reported that US troops, backed by helicopters, launched the attack five miles into its territory, killing eight people, including four children. But at the funerals of the victims, where angry crowds chanted anti-American slogans, an Associated Press photographer said he saw the bodies of seven men.</p> <p>The US refused to comment publicly, but an official said the raid's target was Abu Ghadiya, a former aide of the Iraqi insurgent leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Ghadiya was a major smuggler of al-Qaida-linked foreign fighters into Iraq, the official told Reuters. \"He [Abu Ghadiya] is believed to be dead. This undoubtedly will have a debilitating effect on this foreign fighter smuggling network.\"</p> <p>If confirmed, it would be the first such US strike inside Syria since the 2003 invasion. Muallem, in the first public comments by the Damascus government, warned that an attack recurred, Syria would defend its territory. \"The Americans know that we stand against al-Qaida,\" he said. \"They know full well we are trying to tighten our border with Iraq.\"</p> <p>Muallem had been due to hold a press conference with David Miliband, the foreign secretary, but the event was cancelled by mutual agreement, apparently because Miliband did not want to be questioned about the raid. Miliband said Britain was concerned about the growth of al-Qaida groups and insurgent networks developing along the Syria-Iraq border. British officials claimed Muallem did not deny the seriousness of the problem and the need for better cooperation with Iraq, but gave no firm commitments. In Baghdad, the Iraqi government spokesman, Ali al-Dabbagh, appeared to support the US by calling the area of the attack \"a staging ground for activities by terrorist organisations hostile to Iraq\". He added the US operation \"was targeting smugglers who transferred people to Iraq\".</p> <p>The US has steadily been ceding control of the Iraqi armed forces to the Maliki government and has transferred security responsibility for 12 of Iraq's 18 provinces. But the US still controls Iraqi air space and runs military operations where and when it chooses. \"This is not something we can control or respond to,\" an Iraqi defence official said. But Brigadier Fadel al-Sultani, now responsible for security in the Hilla region - which takes in part of the restive Anbar province that stretches towards the Syrian border - said the province was no longer a haven for insurgents using the Iraqi border town of Qaim as a staging point.</p> <p>\"We can say with certainty that al-Qaida are 95% defeated,\" said Sultani. \"They have gone. Five percent are out there and are robust. We retain a strong interest in them, and so do the Americans. They were with us this morning discussing an offensive.\" A convoy of senior US officers left his headquarters compound in Hilla around noon on Sunday.</p> <p>The attack in Syria also provoked new concerns about the deal extending the legal basis for US forces in Iraq after a UN mandate expires in December, with a prominent Kurdish politician, Mahmoud Othman, saying Iraq's government had no prior knowledge of the raid.</p>",

  "<p>I am standing frozen in the middle of the A1203 as two lines of traffic hurtle homicidally toward me. My heel is caught in a manhole cover, my foot intricately buckled into the shoe. Hack that I am, it is not my life that flashes before me, but the headlines: Woman Killed by High Heels. As a women who grew up in Start-rites, idolising women who chained themselves to lamp-posts, this is not the finale I had in mind.</p> <p>I lived to tell the tale with my penchant for teetering undiminished. True, I am yet to succumb to the current vogue for 7in swaggerers \u00e1 la Posh or Paltrow; a trend that has been so fervently emulated that even sturdy old John Lewis is offering curiously infantalising lessons in how to walk in them. And my head is as yet unturned by Christian Louboutin's recent declaration that he will produce the first 8in stiletto outside the world of fetish.</p> <p>Nevertheless, I do sport heels day and night, at home and at large, content to be an individual whose feet are not entirely planted on the ground. In flats I moonwalk, lurch, engage in slapstick collapses; en pointe I glide.</p> <p>The cause lies deep in childhood. A strapping lass, I grew up with everyone predicting I would be 6ft. When I stopped growing at 12, I was left with 6ft attitude on an averagely squat frame. Fakery was the only option. I have won tennis matches in heels, shovelled cow dung while wearing them, even scaled the lower reaches of the Matterhorn. </p> <p>Yet, there are those who find my choice of footwear a dereliction of feminist duty. British activist and academic Sheila Jeffreys, professor in political science at the University of Melbourne, and author of Beauty and Misogyny: Harmful Cultural Practices in the West, speaks for many when she expresses her contempt: \"Men have traditionally demanded that women walk and dance in pain and gained great sexual satisfaction from this. The fashion industry that creates the rules is dominated by men, many of whom are shoe fetishists. They project their interest on to women's broken feet.\"</p> <p>For Jeffreys and others, this fashionable fetishism is a form of self-harm on a level with wearing tightly laced corsets, or foot binding. </p> <p>\"I feel distress when I see women in high heels,\" Jeffreys says. \"I shudder at the pain they must experience and the long-term damage being caused to their bodies. When I see young women struggle to walk and remain upright, I am enraged at the depths of degradation women have to bear in societies where lip service is paid to their equality.\"</p> <p>The rhetoric deployed by heel opponents brings to mind the campaign against corset wearing, specifically the practice of tight lacing, current from the mid-Victorian period onwards. From the late 1860s to the early 1890s the Lancet published at least one article a year on the dangers of tight lacing, a custom held responsible for curvature of the spine, rib deformity, displacement of internal organs, respiratory problems, circulatory diseases, birth defects and a range of fertility issues, as well as broken ribs and puncture wounds.</p> <p>The corset-opposing Rational Dress Society, founded in 1881, included heels as part of its offensive against \"dress that either deforms the figure, impedes the movements of the body, or in any way tends to injure the health\". </p> <p>And they certainly had a point. NHS podiatric surgeon Emma Supple decries the current vogue for \"Killer, statement, gladiatorial heels\" as \"warfare on your feet\". Thousands of British women are rendered immobile by high heels, she says. Corrective surgery is occurring to the tune of \u00a329m a year, be it bunion or corn removal, toe straightening and joint replacement, or the removal of trapped nerves. Four out of 10 women admit to having had accidents, with statistics suggesting that as many as 20,000 women a year are hospitalised by their heels. \"There has to be a change,\" Supple says, \"because this really is a form of self-torture. We have enormous rates of obesity, osteoporosis. Women have to be able to get out of their cars and pound pavements.</p> <p>Cosmetic foot surgery is also on the increase, with treatments including plumping the ball of the foot with dermal filler to provide greater cushioning, and Botox injections to firm up damaged tissue. Dr Michael O'Neill, a podiatric surgeon at the Princess Margaret hospital in Windsor, has noted that prolonged wear may lead to incontinence, stress fractures, back and hip problems, in addition to more than the odd broken ankle. Jaw, neck and head pain may also be a consequence, with menstrual dysfunction and fertility problems completing the lamentable package.</p> <p>Yet many women - myself included - who consider ourselves vehement, lifelong feminists feel no desire to relinquish our heels. In 1995, when Germaine Greer and Suzanne Moore enjoyed a public spat, Greer poured scorn on Moore's \"fuck-me shoes\". \"The thing is,\" sniffed a feminist contemporary at the time, \"some of us don't have a problem with fucking.\"</p> <p>And there's the rub - sex - festering away like the blister it is. When I last experienced heel lust - for a pair of sumptuous 4in Louboutins - my pupils dilated, I had butterflies, and my cheeks turned florid. Freud took the shoe to be a symbol of the vagina, by which logic the heeled shoe becomes vagina with penis, chick with a dick, a 6in emblem of the act of congress. Be this as it may, heels certainly impart suggestive body morphing qualities: not least, the arched back and tilted pelvis of orgasm.</p> <p>Dr Gad Saad is associate professor of marketing at Concordia University, Canada, and author of The Evolutionary Bases of Consumption. \"High heels may well be the most potent aphrodisiac ever concocted,\" he says. \"The height sensuously alters the whole anatomy - foot, leg, thigh, hips, pelvis, buttocks, breasts. Men are perfectly frank in admitting that high heels stimulate their sexual appetite, and women, consequently, assign to stilted shoes all the magic of a love potion.</p> <p>\"In particular, heels alter the angle of the buttocks by 20 or 30 degrees to create a more youthful and thus fertile-looking body,\" he continues. I have a vision of scarlet-buttocked baboons grotesquely parading their attributes. \"Not far off,\" he concedes. Saad is nonchalant regarding the self-harm aspect, seeing it as merely one of many sacrifices made in raising mating status; considerably less threatening, say, than the lunatic risk-taking inspired by testosterone. </p> <p>Personally, the sacrifice is minimal. Naturally high-arched individual that I am, I am steadier in three or four inches than I am without. My feet are deformity-free, and I am yet to fracture an ankle, both of which eventualities would stop me in my tracks. I rather enjoy the subversion of taking the ostensible tokens of women's oppression and transforming them into a strategy to exploit and enjoy. The literal danger of heels I can live without; their symbolic dangers make them ever more appealing. </p> <p>Flat shoes may be pragmatic, but they do not come freighted with any beauty, mythology, or exotica. Heels are the totemic object craved by want-to-be women, be it the little girl, the transvestite, or the legion of tottering teens for whom no weekend metamorphosis is complete without a little unelevating elevation. </p> <p>Heels supply entry-level vampishness, are the object by which constructed, faux-femininity is bestowed. My own attitude is that of the playful homovestite - a woman who gets a kick out of hamming up her femininity - content to be an object of the male gaze so long as I get to feel in control of matters, and give just as good as I get. </p> <p>Feminism counts for nothing if it is not a guarantee of choice. And while I choose to pursue politics proper in a state of high seriousness, so I see no contradiction for the politics of dress to be pursued in a spirit of high camp. What heels inhibit in terms of speed, they restore by means of swagger. The stiletto, after all, was originally a weapon, infamously becoming so again in Single White Female, in which the identity-purloining Hedy lends fatal meaning to the notion of bringing a man to heel.</p> <p>Spikes will always be de rigueur in the boardroom because they constitute a form of armour, suggestive of a certain ball-imperilling bravura. The authority they bestow is compellingly ambiguous: an S&amp;M adornment where each party remains tantalisingly uncertain who is the S and who the M.</p> <p>As ever, one does not get far in a discussion of power without a high five to matters of class. The heel first became a fashion phenomenon when taken up by 15th-century Venetian courtesans in the form of chopines. The chopine, a stratospheric platform ranging in height from 7in to a literally staggering 20in, required its wearer to be bolstered by attendants. It was the ultimate expression of the heel's ability to empower by apparently doing the reverse.</p> <p>In a milieu in which aristocratic women were barely educated chattels, so cloistered that it was thought provocative for them to appear at windows, the chopine vaunted its wearer as the comparatively sexually assertive, economically independent individual she was. She may have been a working girl, but her footwear declared the Venetian courtesan as boasting the leisure not to street walk, but teeter beguilingly amid an entourage.</p> <p>Where prostitutes pioneered, so the high-born followed suit. Catherine De' Medici carried the vogue to France when she married the future Henri II in 1533. A diminutive teenager, Catherine exploited her heels to provide her with the stature of a queen and a gait to rival the towering presence of Henri's mistress, Diane de Poitiers.</p> <p>Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries both sexes availed themselves of strategically supplemented stature to gesture toward their patrician idleness. Until, of course, the French Revolution, when patrician idleness was the last attribute anyone cared to advertise. Marie Antoinette went to the guillotine on a defiant two extra inches, symbol of a swaggering old order brought brutishly down to earth.</p> <p>Two centuries on, the rich still choose to signify their covetable inactivity by means of added inches: the well-heeled inseparable from their cab spikes, the arriviste most precariously shod of all. Sex and the City, that obsession of contemporary womanhood, embraced the chopine legacy with gusto. Patricia Field, chief architect of its modishness, declared that she used stilettos to \"symbolise the characters' sexual power, as well as their independence\". If the series' fifth character was New York, then the sixth was Manolo Blahnik, the consummate dream man against which any passing Priapus might be measured.</p> <p>In the celluloid take, Bradshaw's apotheosis comes when she discovers a place where she can lay her Blahniks (a moment that provoked a collective gasp of pleasure in the cinema in which I saw it). Later, the hero re-presents her with these heels in place of an engagement ring, provoking a bout of rapturous intercourse.</p> <p>Whatever appetites are depicted, the insatiable desire for footwear will always prove dominant. Heels exert a mythical hold over Sex and the City's protagonists as surely as Moira Shearer's ballet slippers did in The Red Shoes: an addiction both slavish and exquisitely arousing. Would these girls go all the way for a good eight inches? Damn right.</p> <p>And, yet, much as I am in thrall to Monsieur Louboutin, I am not feeling it for the 8in spike. As Emma Supple notes, there is something unappealingly ludicrous about fetish wear outside the boudoir. Gad Saad sees scope for only more ridiculousness: \"What we're looking at is a form of runaway selection in an attempt to create an ever more alluring visual stimulus. In a sense it will only stop once it is not longer feasible for women to actually move.\" Victoria Beckham certainly approached this in her recent outing in 5in, \"heel-free\" heels, requiring her spouse to function less as arm candy than as a crutch.</p> <p>Sheila Jeffreys sees the vogue as revealing an anxiety about women's position: \"Women have gained entry to the public sphere and occupations once confined to men in ways unthinkable in the 60s. Increasingly, they are being required to pay the price, what I call the 'sexual corv\u00e9e' in which they compensate men for their lost power by creating sexual delight for them as they totter about.\"</p> <p>Even the high priest of foot fetishism isn't taken. \"I think there's a limit,\" Blahnik says. \"Anything over 11.5cm [4in] is just too much. You can't walk properly; it's no longer elegant.\" Four inches and a girl's going places, eight and she will have difficulty merely rising to her feet.</p> <p>Doubtless, fashion itself will prove the great leveller. Just as the corset was eventually spurned as anything other than an occasional fetish by modish women keen to dance, cycle, and make strides into the workplace, so the 8in heel will deservedly be shunned. Women of the world, you have nothing to lose but your bunions, hammertoes and stress fractures. Best of all, I could pass for a sensible-shoe girl in saying so.</p>",
  "<p>The government's commissioning of a \u00a3385m telecommunications contract to help motorists beat jams on motorways took nearly three times as long as planned and cost five times more than expected, a committee of MPs says today.</p> <p>The Commons public accounts committee said the rest of Whitehall should follow their findings to learn what mistakes to avoid when they are tendering for big and complex projects.</p> <p>The report is highly critical of the Highways Agency, which awarded the telecommunications project to wire the motorway network so drivers could receive \"real time\" warnings of jams and accidents so they could change their routes to avoid them. </p> <p>The MPs say the jury is still out on how effective the system will be since it will take over 10 years to cover all motorways. It also questions government claims that it will save the economy \u00a32.8bn by reducing traffic congestion.</p> <p>The MPs say: \"Neither the agency nor its advisers, a consortium called KHHD (comprising KMPG, Herbert Smith, Hyder and Detica), had any real understanding of the amount of work required to meet the desired quality \u2026 Ultimately, the agency had no effective incentives to influence the behaviour of its advisers. The agency had only two members of staff dedicated to the procurement \u2026 Controls over the advisers were allowed to slip.\"</p> <p>The ministry did achieve a \u00a32m cut in the price when it awarded the contract to GeneSYS, a special purpose company owned by American Fluor Corporation and HSBC bank.</p> <p>Edward Leigh, the Conservative chairman of the committee, said: \"The procurement process itself was conducted with great attention to detail, contributing to a fall in the bid price paid by the selected bidder, GeneSYS, and no ground was given on the balance of risks. But the process dragged on for five years, rather than the two originally expected. An early casualty was competitive tension when well-qualified potential bidders opted out of the competition.</p> <p>\"Public bodies taking forward projects as large and complex as this should learn lessons from the lack of effective control which the Highways Agency exercised over its external advisers. </p> <p>\"Agency staff had no time to check what the advisers were doing to earn their money. And the advisers had no performance incentives applied to their work. They ended up costing \u00a315m, five times more than expected at the outset.\"</p>",
  "<p>How was it allowed to happen? How did politics in the US come to be dominated by people who make a virtue out of ignorance? Was it charity that has permitted mankind's closest living relative to spend two terms as president? How did Sarah Palin, Dan Quayle and other such gibbering numbskulls get to where they are? How could Republican rallies in 2008 be drowned out by screaming ignoramuses insisting that Barack Obama was a Muslim and a terrorist?</p> <p>Like most people on my side of the Atlantic, I have for many years been mystified by American politics. The US has the world's best universities and attracts the world's finest minds. It dominates discoveries in science and medicine. Its wealth and power depend on the application of knowledge. Yet, uniquely among the developed nations (with the possible exception of Australia), learning is a grave political disadvantage.</p> <p>There have been exceptions over the past century - Franklin Roosevelt, JF Kennedy and Bill Clinton tempered their intellectualism with the common touch and survived - but Adlai Stevenson, Al Gore and John Kerry were successfully tarred by their opponents as members of a cerebral elite (as if this were not a qualification for the presidency). Perhaps the defining moment in the collapse of intelligent politics was Ronald Reagan's response to Jimmy Carter during the 1980 presidential debate. Carter - stumbling a little, using long words - carefully enumerated the benefits of national health insurance. Reagan smiled and said: \"There you go again.\" His own health programme would have appalled most Americans, had he explained it as carefully as Carter had done, but he had found a formula for avoiding tough political issues and making his opponents look like wonks.</p> <p>It wasn't always like this. The founding fathers of the republic - Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, John Adams, Alexander Hamilton and others - were among the greatest thinkers of their age. They felt no need to make a secret of it. How did the project they launched degenerate into George W Bush and Sarah Palin?</p> <p>On one level, this is easy to answer. Ignorant politicians are elected by ignorant people. US education, like the US health system, is notorious for its failures. In the most powerful nation on earth, one adult in five believes the sun revolves round the earth; only 26% accept that evolution takes place by means of natural selection; two-thirds of young adults are unable to find Iraq on a map; two-thirds of US voters cannot name the three branches of government; the maths skills of 15-year-olds in the US are ranked 24th out of the 29 countries of the OECD. But this merely extends the mystery: how did so many US citizens become so stupid, and so suspicious of intelligence? Susan Jacoby's book The Age of American Unreason provides the fullest explanation I have read so far. She shows that the degradation of US politics results from a series of interlocking tragedies.</p> <p>One theme is both familiar and clear: religion - in particular fundamentalist religion - makes you stupid. The US is the only rich country in which Christian fundamentalism is vast and growing.</p> <p>Jacoby shows that there was once a certain logic to its anti-rationalism. During the first few decades after the publication of The Origin of Species, for instance, Americans had good reason to reject the theory of natural selection and to treat public intellectuals with suspicion. From the beginning, Darwin's theory was mixed up in the US with the brutal philosophy - now known as social Darwinism - of the British writer Herbert Spencer. Spencer's doctrine, promoted in the popular press with the help of funding from Andrew Carnegie, John D Rockefeller and Thomas Edison, suggested that millionaires stood at the top of a scala natura established by evolution. By preventing unfit people being weeded out, government intervention weakened the nation. Gross economic inequalities were both justifiable and necessary.</p> <p>Darwinism, in other words, became indistinguishable from the most bestial form of laissez-faire economics. Many Christians responded with revulsion. It is profoundly ironic that the doctrine rejected a century ago by such prominent fundamentalists as William Jennings Bryan is now central to the economic thinking of the Christian right. Modern fundamentalists reject the science of Darwinian evolution and accept the pseudoscience of social Darwinism.</p> <p>But there were other, more powerful, reasons for the intellectual isolation of the fundamentalists. The US is peculiar in devolving the control of education to local authorities. Teaching in the southern states was dominated by the views of an ignorant aristocracy of planters, and a great educational gulf opened up. \"In the south\", Jacoby writes, \"what can only be described as an intellectual blockade was imposed in order to keep out any ideas that might threaten the social order.\"</p> <p>The Southern Baptist Convention, now the biggest Protestant denomination in the US, was to slavery and segregation what the Dutch Reformed Church was to apartheid in South Africa. It has done more than any other force to keep the south stupid. In the 1960s it tried to stave off desegregation by establishing a system of private Christian schools and universities. A student can now progress from kindergarten to a higher degree without any exposure to secular teaching. Southern Baptist beliefs pass intact through the public school system as well. A survey by researchers at the University of Texas in 1998 found that one in four of the state's state school biology teachers believed humans and dinosaurs lived on earth at the same time.</p> <p>This tragedy has been assisted by the American fetishisation of self-education. Though he greatly regretted his lack of formal teaching, Abraham Lincoln's career is repeatedly cited as evidence that good education, provided by the state, is unnecessary: all that is required to succeed is determination and rugged individualism. This might have served people well when genuine self-education movements, like the one built around the Little Blue Books in the first half of the 20th century, were in vogue. In the age of infotainment, it is a recipe for confusion.</p> <p>Besides fundamentalist religion, perhaps the most potent reason intellectuals struggle in elections is that intellectualism has been equated with subversion. The brief flirtation of some thinkers with communism a long time ago has been used to create an impression in the public mind that all intellectuals are communists. Almost every day men such as Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly rage against the \"liberal elites\" destroying America.</p> <p>The spectre of pointy-headed alien subversives was crucial to the election of Reagan and Bush. A genuine intellectual elite - like the neocons (some of them former communists) surrounding Bush - has managed to pitch the political conflict as a battle between ordinary Americans and an over-educated pinko establishment. Any attempt to challenge the ideas of the rightwing elite has been successfully branded as elitism.</p> <p>Obama has a lot to offer the US, but none of this will stop if he wins. Until the great failures of the US education system are reversed or religious fundamentalism withers, there will be political opportunities for people, like Bush and Palin, who flaunt their ignorance.<br><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com\"><br>monbiot.com</a></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday November 4 2008. The Southern Baptist Convention is not the biggest denomination in the US. We meant to describe it as the biggest Protestant denomination. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>In a speech to the Royal Society of Arts yesterday, justice secretary Jack Straw took us on a tour of his world. In that world, although the government has invested wisely in punishment, with England spending more of its output on law and order than any other OECD country, the penal system lacks public confidence. And there's a simple explanation for this - it's all because of the \"criminal justice lobby\" that has forgotten about victims, shrouded the system in a \"fog of platitudes\" and lost the ability to communicate in plain language. We must, Straw said, refocus the system on \"punishment\" and \"reform\" - two simple worlds that the public understands and can sign up to.</p> <p>In a parallel universe the justice system is not run by penal reform groups, but by New Labour - a government responsible for most of the complexity and jargon Straw bemoans. The money spent has resulted in overcrowded prisons whose record numbers undermine their capacity to reform offenders and cut reoffending. That government also seldom wearies of repeating the tired and lazy mantra that speaking up for victims must mean getting tough on offenders - often for electorally expedient reasons. One wonders what lesson sentencers will draw from Straw's decision to repeat it now.</p> <p>Straw is right about one thing, though. The crisis of the penal system in England and Wales is testament to the fact that it lacks a coherent public philosophy, a story about why and whom, what way and how much, we punish that can really connect with public thinking about crime in society.</p> <p>Such a philosophy starts from where \"public opinion\" recognisably is. But it need not end there. Given the condition and failings of prisons today, society needs to find a rationale for radically reducing the scale and harshness of the penal system - and for that milder and smaller system. Penal moderation is the best candidate we have for such a philosophy, and it has more to offer than Straw would have people believe.</p> <p>Penal moderation brings together three ideas: restraint, parsimony and dignity. It seeks, first, to instill a sense of caution in how society talks about and delivers punishment in ways that reflect the ambivalence that most people feel towards it. It reminds us, second, that prison is perennially failing, and punishment is destined to disappoint, because the levers that lead individuals to conform lie mainly beyond its control. It should thus be an institution of last resort. Third, penal moderation requires a penal system that treats with dignity all those whom are brought under its control, recognising that offenders are and remain citizens and must be treated accordingly. To speak about punishment like this is not a counsel of despair. Nor is it to \"forget victims\". It is, however, to challenge the reckless and costly fantasy that there exists a penal solution to crime problems and to recognise there are better ways in which to protect the rights and dignity of victims than getting, or sounding, tough with offenders.</p> <p>The opposite of moderation is not simply expansion, but excess - an accurate description of how our society responds to crime today. Historians can be left to puzzle over why a government that inherited and sustained falling crime levels has behaved with such counterproductive hyperactivity in this field. The penal crisis is, however, a legacy of that restless excess.</p> <p>Penal moderation assists here by reminding us that it doesn't have to be this way. Since 1995 prison numbers have risen by 60%. In France over that period they rose by 1%, in Canada they fell by 11%. In Straw's world, there is a government proud of its record on law and order. In the rest of the world, England and Wales are regarded - like the US - as a global punitive outlier.</p> <p>Over the last decade penal policy has been driven by the most strident voices from polls, focus groups or the press. Yet this rests on a partial reading of what is known about public sentiment towards crime and punishment. There are victims whose lives are blighted by crime or whose experience makes them angry enthusiasts for \"tough\" punishment. But there is also evidence that the majority of people have little experience of crime, rarely think about it and, when prompted to do so, express ambivalent feelings about the proper response to it. These are not people minded to send a donation to a penal reform group. But when given actual cases to ponder they sentence much like, or more lightly than, real sentencers. They view prison as futile and back the idea of offenders repairing damage they have caused. They also know a waste of money when they see one.</p> <p>Political moderation means speaking for this ambivalence about punishment, for those who understand England and Wales as tolerant, forgiving, pragmatic nations - not as lands of thoughtless penal excess conducted in their name.</p> <p>Twice in his speech Straw invoked Winston Churchill's remark about punishment being an \"unfailing\" test of the civilisation of any country. Yet I doubt Churchill intended that a society could pass this test with the levels of law and order spending of which Straw seems so proud, or by investing more money in prisons in the last five years than in the NHS. In a civilised society, punishment should a matter for sorrow and regret, not a badge of political pride.</p> <p>\u2022 Ian Loader is professor of criminology at Oxford University and a member of the Commission on English Prisons Today <br><a href=\"mailto:ian.loader@crim.ox.ac.uk\">ian.loader@crim.ox.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Democratic leaders are raising their hopes of an election-year sweep - winning the White House and achieving solid majorities in both houses of Congress to dominate Washington on a scale unseen in 40 years. With Barack Obama ahead in the polls and the Democrats likely to expand their majority in the House of Representatives, party leaders are focused on consolidating their control of the Senate.</p> <p>Democratic prospects brightened further yesterday after Ted Stevens, a Republican senator from Alaska, was convicted on corruption charges. Stevens, 84, and the longest serving Republican in the Senate, was fighting off a challenge from his Democratic challenger, Mark Begich, even before he was found guilty of lying about free home renovations received from a wealthy oil contractor.</p> <p>With Stevens's now facing a five-year jail term, it looks increasingly likely that Democrats will reach the magical number of 60 seats in the Senate. That would give them what is called a filibuster-proof majority, making it impossible for Republicans to cut off debate or limit legislation.</p> <p>If Obama wins the White House, that would bring a consolidation of Democratic power in Washington unseen since the 1960s. \"This is a tectonic race,\" Charles Schumer, the New York senator who is overseeing the Democrats' Senate election campaign, told reporters last week. \"This will change things, not just for an election cycle, but a generation.\"</p> <p>A wave of anti-Republican sentiment and excitement over Obama's candidacy that has brought more Democrats to the polls in early voting, has seen the party predicting far bigger gains than those expected a few weeks ago. John McCain's faltering campaign has also hurt Republican candidates in battleground states.</p> <p>Both parties are using the prospect of a filibuster-proof Senate in their campaigns. The Democrats are pushing for 60 as a goal that would allow Obama, if he is elected, to push through sweeping changes on energy, healthcare and foreign policy. The Republicans are campaigning on the dangers of unchecked Democratic rule. Their television ads now routinely link Obama to Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House speaker, and Harry Reid, the Democratic Senate majority leader, warning of a dangerous liberal triumvirate.</p> <p>\"Liberals are bent on handing Barack Obama a filibuster-proof Senate majority to rubber-stamp his radical agenda,\" warned Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, in a fundraising email.</p> <p>The Democrats won a 51-49 majority in the Senate in the 2006 elections. But that did not translate into effective power under Senate rules that allow the minority party to extend debate, preventing legislation from being put to a vote.</p> <p>The Republicans have launched nearly 100 filibusters in the past two years, reducing the Senate to a state of paralysis. Senate Democrats were not even able to win enough votes to withdraw US forces from Iraq, even though several similar bills easily passed through the House of Representatives. That could now change, according to Reid, the Senate majority leader. In a recent email to supporters, he wrote: \"Everything Democrats believe in and fight for is in reach ... We stand at the brink of electing Barack Obama and giving him a filibuster-proof majority.\"</p> <p>But solid majorities in Congress are no guarantee a president would win cooperation from his own party, as Jimmy Carter found. The Democrats won 61 seats in the Senate when Carter was elected in 1976, but he rapidly fell out with his party.</p> <p>Obama, if elected, could also run into resistance from a number of the new crop of Democrats, especially those who are currently competing in southern states. A number of the first-time Democratic contenders lean to the right, while some of the Republicans now fighting for their political survival are moderates.</p> <p>\"You are going to have some defections on the Democratic side, because these are some conservative Democrats,\" said Rhodes Cook, who runs a respected political newsletter. \"Whoever is elected will be hemmed in by the economy a great deal, so that might also be the point that overrides the size of the majority.\"</p> <p>Out of the 35 seats up for election, the Republicans are defending 23 and the Democrats 12. Democrats are confident of winning all 12. Republicans face tough contests across the map, with Democrats even, or ahead, in about a dozen seats.</p> <p>By last week, Republican congressional candidates were close to open revolt against McCain. John Ensign, the Nevada Republican who is heading the party's Senate election campaign, was describing McCain as a drag on his fellow candidates. \"Our candidates are running ahead of John McCain in almost every place that I mentioned across the country,\" he told reporters.</p> <p>The challenges to the Republicans cut across geography as well as ideology. Seats held by retiring senators in Virginia, New Mexico and Colorado are now virtually assured of going Democrat.</p> <p>Party elders even in conservative states are facing a tough time. In North Carolina, Elizabeth Dole, who served in two Republican administrations and ran for the White House herself in 2000, is having to spend her own money to fend off a Democratic challenger.</p> <p>In Mississippi and Georgia, a high turnout of African-American voters for Obama in early voting appears to have breathed new life into Democratic Senate challenges once seen as long shots.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Jason Wood:</strong> I was in Of Time and the City's screening at Cannes and the reaction was astonishing. The positive response seemed to take you entirely by surprise. </p> <p><strong>Terence Davies:</strong> I never expect it because I had had it beaten out of me as a child; I never think anyone will like what I do. I'm always terrified they won't like it and of course you always count the people who leave. They are on your death list. The people who stayed, stayed because they wanted to. You see it in a different way with an audience. And when it's over it's such a relief. It's such a struggle. I never expected that reaction. I truly never. </p> <p>I have no illusions about my work but I must add I have no illusions about anybody else's either. I am very strict with myself and I think, \"no, that could have been improved\", \"why didn't I put a little bit more then? Why didn't we come out then?\" It was what I thought was right at the time and you have to stand by that. And if it completely fails you have got to say, \"But that is what I meant at the time.\" </p> <p>There's a line by Vaughan Williams, I think it's on his Sixth Symphony, when he says, \"I don't know whether I like it but it is what I meant.\" And that's a wonderful thing to say upon your own work. Sometimes you don't know whether you like it or not but you think what gave me great joy, more than anything else, is that people from all over the world responded to it. </p> <p>I've just come back from Poland where they put a retrospective on and they were turning people away. I never thought that would happen in my life, ever. And that it is in a foreign country. You change in some peculiar way. I'm still going through that change and I am still stunned by what happened. </p> <p><strong>JW:</strong> Peter Bradshaw's review in the Guardian suggested that the film should play for eternity in cinemas. As the Cannes applause rang out it was as if a weight had been lifted from your shoulders. </p> <p><strong>TD:</strong> I was relieved. People see me as a pessimist and I've been in a cinema where there were literally three people watching the film. So I know what that's like and it does crush you. You shouldn't expect people to go and see the film just because you happen to think they should.</p> <p>And the other thing I keep in my mind too is my great love is Bruckner. The music is utterly sublime. In 1866 he conducted the Fourth Symphony or the Fifth, I can never remember. And when he finished there were more people in the orchestra than there were in the audience. And a 16-year-old Mahler was there and he went up to the composer and said \"Herr Bruckner, this is wonderful music.\" And Bruckner, with tears in his eyes, said \"Yes, but nobody wants to hear it.\" And he went on to write another five symphonies. If Bruckner can do it, there really is no excuse is there?</p> <p><strong>JW:</strong> The film is structured so as to resemble the fragmented nature of memory. Was the fact that you hadn't made a documentary before an advantage in terms of not having to be linear or objective? In this way Of Time and the City reminded me of Guy Maddin's recent My Winnipeg. </p> <p><strong>TD:</strong> A lot of people have mentioned to me that the Maddin film is very good. I had some tussles because of my approach. I said to the editor, who was terrific, that we cut it like it is fiction. I was clear right from the start in all the funding documents that it would be subjective. Some things did cause problems. I was told that I hadn't sufficiently contextualised the Korean war. Well, that's nonsense, of course I have. If you want me to say why it is there three times so Joe Schmo from Kokomo understands it, I'm not prepared to do that. It is a subjective essay. Over this I wouldn't budge.</p> <p>But when it is subjective and when it is about emotional memory as well, moving from one memory to another, it can be very difficult for other people to get it. There was a point where I thought it's just not going to work, it's not seamless. Too many holes. If it's not seamless I can tell. When people identify a problem in fiction it is never there. It is usually never there but that is what you think it is. It's got to be seamless but it has also got to be true to what I remembered and that is a real problem for some people.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-339202088\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1891830230_gdn-nat-081027-sf-of-time-city-review-01-VFa-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p><strong>JW:</strong> You talk about memory and the way the film is structured; the collages you create between image and sound are another way of invoking memory. You do this with the football results and the way they are read out. Are words and sounds as important as images?</p> <p><strong>TD:</strong> Oh God, yes! We remember hourly probably more in sound than any other sense. The only other sense the cinema can't use is smell. If I smell cut grass I am immediately back in my primary school, with a little strip we were not allowed to cross. It is instantaneous. So I think I've got a very good emotional memory, not just of what was seen, but what was heard. At age 10, nobody talks to you so you listen all the time. So these football results at a quarter to five on a Saturday were huge. I didn't know what they meant as I didn't like sport. Like a mantra, like the one I used in the beginning of Distant Voices, Still Lives of the shipping forecast. I had no idea what it meant but it was like a magical mantra, like God speaking. It was fabulous. Silence as well. On Sundays there were times when you were on your own and you would listen to the silence. An absence of sound can be very provocative, especially on a Sunday afternoon when there's nothing to do and nowhere to go. And you felt that this would go on forever.</p> <p>I think my ear is very acute and my emotional memory is the same because those things are visceral. And I think if those things are true people will recognise them as true, even if they are highly artificial. If it is true I think people recognise it even if they are not cine-literate. And if it is false they can tell. And you can't explain it. You just feel it. That's of huge importance in art, particularly music. Even more so in the cinema. First two or three bars and you are going to believe it or not. It's instantaneous. </p> <p><strong>JW:</strong> The music, for me, was revelatory. The slum clearance was particularly harsh but you cut it to the most transcendental and uplifting music. Was the intention to provide a counterpoint?</p> <p><strong>TD:</strong> Of course. Music as a counterpoint is always much more interesting. I always feel music and image instinctively. I don't have to think about it. It tells me. There are templates. My favourite writer is Chekhov, the dialogue most of all. I think that the play Uncle Vanya is one of the greatest achievements in art. But what he does at the end of Vanya, I can't even read the play without weeping. Vanya's life has been destroyed. He realises all the years he has strived for have been for nothing. And the last line is, \"Oh my child, there is such a weight on my heart. If you only knew much how my heart aches.\" And his niece says two and a half pages about hope. And you know that that hope is going to be crushed when she gets to 40. And you cannot watch the end of that play. You just weep. Even in a bad production. What he shows you is the result of complete disillusionment. It's so simple but Chekhov, what a genius! If you can do that with images and music there is something so sublime about it.</p> <p>Going back to Bruckner, in the Seventh Symphony there's this long, long tune. It really is heartbreaking. Then it stops. And there is this pause. And then just the violins and this echo. My God! You've waited for this resolution but it is not a resolution, it is just an echo of what is to come 40 minutes later. I love that. And when I see it in films it thrills me. The Robe, which is one of the first films in CinemaScope, has got this wonderful score by Alfred Newman. And there is one exquisite scene where Richard Burton is saying goodbye to Jean Simmons and he's getting on this boat. Obviously it is in the studio. But he gets on the boat and the boat just drifts away in this fog and you just hear this main tune. And it's exquisite because it is perfect for what it is showing. And there's this rising score from Jerome Moross in The Big Country and I get so thrilled by it. </p> <p><strong>JW:</strong> The film shows you a Liverpool beyond The Beatles and football, which is what people tend to think about when they think about the city. Your narration is very significant. It lends character because it is so impassioned. </p> <p><strong>TD:</strong> What was odd was that I was writing this commentary as I was doing it and recording it as a rough guide. We got someone to do part of the narration but it just didn't work and the producers said, \"No, you must do it.\" I was worried that when you hear your own voice it can sound a bit like the Queen Mother after she died. I said, \"Are you sure?\" We recorded it in a day. I do feel impassioned about it. One thing I did notice was my breath control is such that I would become terribly asthmatic. I'm very conscious of that. It's strange because you can't hear yourself and it is always a shock to hear yourself. Do I really sound like that? All my films have strong Liverpool accents. It always makes me feel a bit embarrassed because I wonder where it came from? At one point they asked me to put in how I lost my accent and I said, \"You can't be serious? You really can't be serious? I'm not doing that.\" I was worried and I was staying with my sister Maisie and I said, \"When did I lose my accent?\" and she said, \"You never had one.\" What was wonderful is that part of the narration would come when I would see something that I thought was odd. I've got to put that in. I've got to say something there - something's that elliptical. And sometimes you don't know where it has come from. I don't know why you see three images and you think, \"I've got to say that.\" But I was writing it as I was doing it and that was incredibly exciting I must say.</p> <p><strong>JW:</strong> You express great anger at the treatment of the working classes. I sense that the Liverpool we have today is still suffering because of those policies of destroying communities and shunting them out to the outskirts of the city. Liverpool is a cash rich city but it is a city where investment has been at the cost of its soul.</p> <p><strong>TD:</strong> But the tragedy was that we who were living in those slums at the time thought this was the New Jerusalem, we really did. And they were Jerry built, badly designed and they were slums again in waiting. And that is what they became within five years. The tragedy was that no one had enough sense, or perhaps courage, and certainly enough money to say, \"Some of this stock is OK. We'll move you out, renovate it, then move you back in.\" Once you destroy a community you never get it back. Alas it was a betrayal that was done with the very best of intentions. That's even harder in a way to accept. </p> <p>Once that's gone what do you replace it with? And this is not only true of Liverpool but also true of this country. You replace it with finality, and you make finality a virtue. And that is what is really shocking. That's almost worse morally than what happened in the slum cases. </p> <p>Thatcher did a lot of damage to the psyche of this country. What are you going to go back to, 19th-century capitalism? Where people live in their own sewage? Because that is what will happen. Is that what we want? In New York they had people living in cellars, in the dark. Do we want to go back to that? Of course we don't.</p> <p><strong>JW:</strong> What do you think of the Liverpool of today? It must be a million miles away from the one you grew up in?</p> <p><strong>TD:</strong> It is not the city I grew up in. Everywhere I knew is gone. Within walking distance of my house there were eight cinemas. That was without the eight there were in town. All gone now apart from one left in London Road and Fact, which is a modern cinema. All the places I knew and all the places associated with my childhood are just gone and that is very hard to bear. Going back to Liverpool it was very hard to see that and not feel something very profound had been lost. I'm not saying we should go back to the old days, and the Liverpool of today is in many ways more sophisticated, but I do think that we've lost something. This doesn't apply solely to Liverpool but to England as a whole. Maybe the thing that we have lost at the expense of this newfound sophistication is a certain innocence. </p> <p><strong>JW:</strong> There are themes such as cinema as a means of escape, Catholicism, sexuality and loss that recur throughout your features - certainly your early narrative features. And you have mentioned your reluctance to make another Liverpool film because you had done that. Was making this film a cathartic or painful experience? </p> <p><strong>TD:</strong> It certainly wasn't cathartic because none of the films have provided that. They were just soddened with this real sense of loss. Why does one need to suffer spiritually or physically? Why does anyone need to suffer? It throws up inside you profound questions about the nature of being human. I suppose with every film I wanted to go back, in some way, to that period when I was incredibly happy. My father died when I was seven, and the four years between primary and secondary school I was ecstatically happy. I was literally sick with happiness. I took in movies for the first time. The first film I took in was Singing in the Rain. What an impact! It can't get much better than that. Just the house became alive. It became one of those houses that drew people to it. Because my father wouldn't allow any visitors at all. He was very, very psychotic. So it was like I was trying to get back to those four years where I was truly happy. Before the onset of sexuality, which has ruined my life.</p> <p>All the men were really big in my family and I was very weedy. And I wasn't aggressive and had lost my accent. I was really brought up by and with women. Incredibly loving, warm, happiness you never thought existed. And then you have to go to secondary school and your paradise is shattered. The constant terror of God's wrath. Which I still have in me although I've not been a practising Catholic for 41 years. But still within me. I examine my conscience every day. I can't help but do it. I examine my motives all the time. Why did you do that? You shouldn't have said that. You shouldn't feel envious because he is better looking than you. When men are good looking I am terribly envious of them. That has to be controlled because I say horrible things to myself and I'm still ashamed of it.</p> <p><strong>JW:</strong> I suffer from hair envy, Terence. When I see people with hair I think \"You lucky bugger!'</p> <p><strong>TD:</strong> Are you a Catholic?</p> <p><strong>JW:</strong> No, I'm an atheist.</p> <p><strong>TD:</strong> Immediately my other response is that you shouldn't be doing this. This is envy - simply because they are better looking than you. And that constant tyranny, because it is a tyranny, of a conscience that is very rigorous and very Catholic. When I first went to confession and my schoolmates said they made things up I was really shocked. I said, \"How can you do that? God will know.\" And any tiny little infringement of it I would say to the priest on a Saturday. \"This is what I did.\" It's still very much there. I don't think I will ever come to a catharsis. I wish I could. Quite honestly I am getting fed up with the struggle.</p> <p><strong>JW:</strong> Did this provide a step closer to closure or is it just an ongoing journey?</p> <p><strong>TD:</strong> I think it will go on till I die really. Which is a pretty depressing prospect. </p> <p><strong>JW:</strong> I want to go back, momentarily, to that moment in Cannes, with the applause ringing in your ears. And I want to counterpoint this with the fairly appalling treatment you have suffered at the hands of the British film industry. For all of the great films you have made you've been dealt a pretty shabby hand I think in recent years. Is there a sense of victory and vindication with this film in the face of all this, particularly the UK Film Council's apathy towards you as a film-maker? </p> <p><strong>TD:</strong> I was relieved. Because being out of work for eight years does something to you. I came back and got great support from Lenny Crooks at the film council, who is a terrific lad and who loves film. I do want Lenny's support put on record. But right now I need two hundred and twenty thousand to close finance on my next project, a romantic comedy. No one will put it up. Potentially it could not get made. You come back to that, particularly from Poland recently, and any kind of sense of worth is destroyed again. Having to start all over again. Re-inventing the wheel, going round knocking on doors and saying are you interested and everyone says, \"We would like to see another Terence Davies film but not with my money.\" That is what is in essence has been said. So not just the spiritual struggle, which I'll have for the rest of my life, but the struggle forward which is becoming very hard to find a reason to carry on sometimes. I get very low and think is it worth the struggle and at the lowest the answer comes back: \"No, it isn't.\" </p> <p>That line from A Man For All Seasons, \"Most people would have fallen asleep at the sermon on the mount,\" and you think, \"How many people out there have heard one note of Bruckner and couldn't care less?\" You can struggle when you are 20, 30 or 40. I'm 63 this year. I'm not a kid anymore. It gets harder by the day. </p> <p><strong>JW:</strong> The reviews that you are getting for Of Time and the City must surely give you encouragement and the strength to carry on?</p> <p><strong>TD:</strong> It fills me with terror. I don't like being me you see. That's a struggle each day. I know it sounds almost banal but it is true. You know when you go into a shop and it has this overhead lighting and you catch yourself in the mirror and you think, \"God, aren't you ugly? And it's that. I just feel frightened because I think there is some awful disaster in store for me.</p> <p><strong>JW:</strong> There is a nice symmetry in that Of Time and the City will be released by the British Film Institute, who were involved in your Trilogy and Distant Voices, Still Lives. This must also provide you with sustenance.</p> <p><strong>TD:</strong> I'm very, very grateful towards those people and to you for saying nice things about me and my work. And those things I treasure. I'm as vain as anyone else. I like my vanity and ego rubbed occasionally. But in my heart of hearts it's as if someone else made them. And if I do watch them, and I rarely do, I think: \"Was that me?\" I know that sounds strange but that is what I feel. And I think it is because I had my self-esteem battered out of me at such a young age. And you can't even get it through validation of your work. </p> <p>Once it is gone it is gone forever. The struggle is to keep from despair and there have been occasions when I thought I would die from sheer despair. I hadn't the strength to go on. But then something happens and you think it is worthwhile. The light will fall in a certain way. Or someone will say something or do something really nice and something glows. Because I am not happy being me, these things affect you. </p> <p><strong>JW:</strong> You have spoken of your admiration for Humphrey Jennings and especially Listen To Britain. You also intimated that these portraits of British life could only be made by British directors. </p> <p><strong>TD:</strong> There are films that can only be made in a specific country but that have a wider meaning. I think that's true of any art form. In connection to Of Time and the City I think only someone who was raised in Liverpool can do it. It might have been someone else, not me. It's just my particular take on that particular city. I know there is a great pride from people who come from there. And I think at best we are rather unusual. Terrific sense of humour, particularly the women; all northern women have got that sense of humour. People are very sharp. Although this incident happened in America it did remind me of the kind of sharpness that you have in Liverpool. I was there, giving a lecture. It was quite cool and I had this Harvard T-shirt on. I walked down this street and a tramp asked me if I could give him some loose change, he wanted to go to Yale. Isn't that great? It is the sort of remark that had me thinking: \"That's the sort of remark you would get in Liverpool.\" I love that. I love that sharpness, that wit. They are still very warm. But this society is changing and once you lose your sense of humour, you might as well be dead. All the people in the world who have created the most evil are those with no sense of humour. They're always trouble.</p> <p><strong>JW:</strong> Though a good number of those that go to see Of Time and The City will be enticed by your previous work it will also attract audiences unfamiliar with your previous films. What would you hope that these people take away from it?</p> <p><strong>TD:</strong> I just hope they will be able to respond to the fact it came from my heart. I try to do that with every film. It is very hurtful when someone rejects that because you are very vulnerable. I hope they will respond to its truth. What I've certainly found since it was shown all over the world is that it triggers memories of their own lives which is remarkable. I never thought that would happen. But to remember and not feel like me and be melancholy about it, but remember and be joyful about it.</p> <p>Christina Rossetti said it I think when she wrote, \"If after you forget and cannot remember, do not grieve, for if the darkness and corruption are the vestige of the thought that once I had, better by far you should forget and smile.\"</p> <p>That you should remember and be sad is not what I want.</p>"
