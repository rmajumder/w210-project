  "<p>The Swiss Hat label, run for 30-odd dedicated years by the Uehlinger family to document all kinds of jazz-tinged new music, has been steadily reissuing Westbrook work. In the process they have done much to reinvigorate Mike and Kate Westbrook's status as UK parallels to Carla Bley in their mix of mischievousness and sonority. This Rossini venture was originally commissioned for a street festival in Lausanne in 1984, with the William Tell overture as its theme. The Westbrooks stitched a jazz envelope around it, for a predominantly brass band with the contrasting reeds sounds of sopranino saxist Lindsay Cooper and the fleet and flawless altoist Peter Whyman wheeling over it. Whyman's alto scythes its way out of Andy Grappy's tuba lines at the opening, the group momentarily suggesting the Liberation Music Orchestra on The Thieving Magpie, and the 18 minute L'Amoroso E Sincero Lindoro (from The Barber of Seville) moves from piano meditations to languorous brass themes and on to Whyman's tantalising squeals and interrogations.

  "<p>Another Brit heist film, this one is set in the 80s - a sensible move given its tiny budget - when a gun and menacing tone were enough to pull off a bank job. But financing alone won't explain away the amateurishness on display. Some of the dialogue is worse than patchy, though Life On Mars duo John Simm and Philip Glenister, crossing to the bad side as crooks alongside Ashley Walters, make a reasonable go of it. They are after a giant emerald being delivered to a Japanese bank. There is some fancy footwork as multiple heists unfold during police interrogation.

  "<p>A few years ago, Sarah Connolly's husband flew out to join her in New York, where she was singing Romeo in a run of Bellini's I Capuleti e i Montecchi. He was met at the airport by a young man who looked oddly like his wife. \"I think he was a bit frightened,\" says Connolly. \"But it was just after a show, and I hadn't had time to get the wig or anything off.\"</p> <p>Connolly's ability to convince in opera's so-called trouser roles - women playing boys or men - has been a calling card throughout a career that now finds her arguably at the top of a glorious roster of outstanding British mezzo-sopranos. Her big break, 10 years ago, came when she was cast as Handel's petulant emperor Xerxes at English National Opera, in Nicholas Hytner's memorable staging. More recently, there has been her imperious Julius Caesar in Glyndebourne's hit Handel production, and an impetuous Octavian in Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier at Scottish Opera and ENO, both of which continued her long-standing working partnership with the director David McVicar.</p> <p>Now she is dressing as Romeo again - but so far, rehearsals for Orpha Phelan's new Opera North production involve nothing more self-consciously masculine than trousers and a battered pair of plimsolls. No funny looks, then, as we repair for coffee and cake in the bookshop around the corner from Leeds's Grand theatre. \"I definitely spend more time on stage being a man,\" Connolly says. \"The roles that suit my voice and physicality work out that way.\" Even in those plimsolls, she is tall and strapping, not the ing\u00e9nue or little- sister type, and she is not tempted by the flirtier female roles, such as Rosina in The Barber of Seville. \"A conductor said to me recently that because I sing fast Handel arias, I must also sing Rossini, but I don't really care for it - I don't like decoration for the sake of it.\" Bellini's writing can be seen as the pinnacle of the 19th-century bel canto school, in which beauty and agility of voice was all; but, as Connolly says, \"the decoration is very much connected to the music, rather than just standing there and showing off\".</p> <p>The Capulets and the Montagues is Bellini's take on the Romeo and Juliet story, premiered in Venice in 1830 and brought to London's Haymarket theatre three years later. Its story comes mainly via sources other than Shakespeare, but follows a similar path to the same tragic conclusion. \"Bellini completely understood fragility, rejection, loyalty, the making and breaking of a promise,\" says Connolly. \"There's something so utterly touching about the spacing in his music - the empty bars, the moments between the notes. I think he draws the character of Romeo very clearly.\"</p> <p>The role sounds like a favourite. \"Oh yes, and it's different every time. But I think it's going to be more special this time than any other.\" London audiences heard her sing it for ENO in 2003, but only in concert format; since then, Connolly says, she has grown \"more technically capable. I've done things that have opened up the high notes, and expanded my general strength as a singer. I can make the phrases go on a bit longer, I can dare to sing more quietly.\" Perhaps the most important experience was singing the colossal role of Dido in Berlioz's The Trojans at ENO in 2004. \"Once you've got through Dido's Farewell, and not died at the end of it, you realise you can get through anything.\"</p> <p>Connolly's route to such epic roles has not been entirely conventional. Her initial training at the Royal College of Music was as a pianist; she spent five years in the BBC Singers, and then very nearly gave up classical singing for jazz. She even had a meeting set up with Ronnie Scott. \"But I wanted so badly to sing Ravel's Sh\u00e9h\u00e9razade, and I could tell the elasticity in my voice was disintegrating. I was breaking down my classical voice. So I chickened out.\" Initially at least, the decision to follow a classical career looked like it might have been the wrong one. \"I had five years of auditions, which were a disaster.\" What kept her going? \"A fascination with why I wasn't getting the work, when people I respected were telling me I had such a lovely voice.\"</p> <p>Once she had that ENO Xerxes under her belt, Connolly established her versatility with several memorable leading roles at the Coliseum, notably in Handel, but also in repertoire from Monteverdi to Mark-Anthony Turnage. And yet, although she is now in demand internationally, there is perhaps a sense that some other UK companies have been slow off the mark in recognising her potential. This is the first time Opera North has come up with a role meaty enough to showcase the Yorkshire-born singer. More surprisingly, she is probably the most distinguished UK singer who has yet to appear with the Royal Opera - she does not make her debut there until next spring, when she heads the cast of Purcell's Dido and Aeneas. Does she ever feel that there's an operatic establishment that she hasn't quite cracked yet? \"Not an establishment as such, but rather, I'd say, there's an inner circle of artists within which the people with the big recording contracts are invited, and I am slightly outside that.\"</p> <p>By the time she sings at Covent Garden, her Dido will be on disc. Not, however, courtesy of any of the companies offering big recording contracts: Connolly raised the funding for the recording herself, which makes it sound like a vanity project until you consider the quality of the forces she was able to persuade to join her. She brought the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment on board, gathered together a cast of A-list colleagues including Gerald Finley, Patricia Bardon and John Mark Ainsley, and persuaded the independent label Chandos to take the project on. The whole thing was recorded, with no conductor, over two days in June.</p> <p>\"There's been a serious musicological approach to it,\" says Connolly, explaining that the version recorded is the one she sang at La Scala in 2006, which incorporates some extra pieces by Purcell. \"It was something that just needed to be done. I felt there was nobody else singing Dido this way. I love playing with the major and minor harmonies - not in a jazzy way, but to colour it.\"</p> <p>Connolly is not new to the idea of funding a recording herself - Heroes and Heroines, her outstanding 2004 Handel arias disc, had a similar genesis, and she has at least one other major project in the pipeline. \"I'm very happy to be working with independent labels. You get far more artistic control. However, it's quite humiliating to have to go and beg for money.\" Artists' agents can also be taken aback to hear Connolly asking to book their singers. \"I rang up John Tomlinson's agent the other day to see when he was free, and the agent said, 'Why are you asking?' I said, 'It's because it's me who's fixing the recording!' But the minute the agents hear who else I've got on board, there's never any question - they pencil it in and say, 'Good for you!' If you want something done in the recording industry, you have to just get off your bum and do it.\"</p> <p>\u2022 I Capuleti e i Montecchi opens at the Grand Theatre, Leeds, on October 21, then tours.

  "<p>Reading about the undercover wartime adventures of 1930s British leading man Leslie Howard, as they have been depicted in a new book by the Spanish writer Jos\u00e9 Rey-X\u00edmena, I was enthralled to learn that a mere actor - O despised breed! - might have been responsible for keeping Francoist Spain out of the second world war. And the Mata Hari details lend the tale the kind of spice you just don't get from a War On Terror. One of Howard's prewar co-stars and ex-lovers, the marvellously named Spanish actress Conchita Montenegro, is claimed to have helped Howard (who was supposedly acting on Winston Churchill's behalf) contact Franco through her husband, the foreign relations adviser to the pro-Fascist Falangist party. Churchill's ambitions achieved, Howard was shot down, along with 14 other civilians and children, on the way home. His death was a public relations coup for Goebbels, and Luftwaffe pilots even photographed the floating wreckage for German newsreels.</p> <p>Howard had given up a lucrative film career in Hollywood, where his most enduring achievement was his mentorship of Humphrey Bogart, his co-star in The Petrified Forest. Back in England, Howard threw himself into quasi-propaganda activities, first in Powell and Pressburger's 49th Parallel (whose aim was to get America into the fight) and then as director-star of The First of the Few. By the time he died, you could certainly say he'd done his bit.</p> <p>This set me thinking about other actors who did their bit, but in particular about 50s Hollywood tough guy Sterling Hayden, whose wartime activities were spotlighted recently when the CIA released documents concerning the activities of its second world war forerunner, the OSS. Hayden's war just makes your hair stand on end. An accomplished sailor who ran away to sea aged 17, he'd sailed the world and captained his first ship by 21. Recruited by Hollywood literally from his yacht-slip, he was cast in Virginia (1941) opposite Madeleine Carroll, whom he married before joining the OSS. He'd made two films when war broke out, causing a six-year gap in his acting career. But Hayden managed to fill the intervening time: his war was like The Guns of Navarone cubed and squared. He ran guns to Tito's partisans; he parachuted into Croatia, then brutally run by Ante Paveli\u0107's fascist Ustase, whose bloodcurdling death-camps nauseated even the SS. It was not the ideal place for a spy to be taken alive.</p> <p>One after another, it seems to me, the really impressive heroes and heavies of postwar Hollywood had wartime experiences that indelibly burnished their screen presence. Lee Marvin survived the death of his whole platoon on Saipan. Charles Durning was first off his landing craft on D-Day, was wounded nine days later, and fit for duty by December, just in time for the Battle of the Bulge, where he was seriously wounded again. Actor Neville Brand (he killed Elvis in Love Me Tender) and tough-guy director Sam Fuller both won the highly prized Combat Infantryman Badge, the working-class, cannon-fodder medal for guys accustomed to bayoneting enemies in the chest then shooting them in the face, inch by inch across the battlefield, day after agonising day.</p> <p>It also astonished me to learn that four British actors who all became Hollywood stars in the 1930s all served together on the western front in the London Scottish Regiment in the first world war: Claude Rains (who was gassed and nearly blinded), Herbert Marshall (who lost a leg and still became a romantic lead!), Ronald Coleman (seriously wounded) and Basil Rathbone (not a scratch).</p> <p>I don't think for a moment that immersion in a nasty, vicious war is the best way produce a new generation of convincing movie tough guys, but when I see Vin Diesel, with his bouncer moves, his cro-magnon, no-cred and his vacuous growly utterances, I do yearn a little for the bloodsoaked macho men of yesteryear. I wouldn't run from Robert De Niro in a dark alley, but Sterling Hayden? Whole different story.</p>",
  "<p>European ministers will meet today in Brussels to discuss the renewable energy directive, a ground-breaking piece of legislation that could kick-start the energy revolution we desperately need to tackle the dual challenges of climate change and energy insecurity.

  "<p>The UK's goods trade deficit climbed to its highest figure in more than 300 years in July, leading analysts to warn that the economy has fallen into recession.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said yesterday that July's deficit with the rest of the world had been revised upwards to \u00a38.238bn - the biggest gap since records began in 1697. It blamed the revisions on a large number of late returns. The goods trade gap reached \u00a38.198bn in August, well above City forecasts of \u00a37.6bn.</p> <p>Paul Dales, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the data supported other evidence suggesting that Britain entered a recession in the past three months.</p> <p>\"Looking ahead, exporters are going to struggle against the background of a rapidly weakening world economy, as survey measures of export orders have recently fallen very sharply,\" he said. \"Overall, these figures suggest that the weakening in overseas activity is deepening the downturn in the UK economy.\"</p> <p>Philip Shaw, an Investec economist, said the figures showed how unbalanced the economy has become.</p> <p>The goods trade gap with non-EU countries widened to \u00a35.165bn from \u00a34.778bn. Analysts had predicted a deficit of \u00a34.6bn. These figures arrived just after the International Monetary Fund warned that Britain was heading into a full-blown recession. It said that the economy was likely to contract by 0.1% next year, the first annual fall since the recession of the early 1990s. </p> <p>Several analysts believe any boost to exports from a weaker pound has yet to generate substantial improvements in the trade balance. The dollar exchange rate has fallen from about two to the pound to 1.75 over the past three months, with the pound also dropping to record lows against the euro. \"August's UK trade data support our view that exporters will feel little benefit from the lower pound while overseas activity is so weak,\" Dales said.</p> <p>The fall in the pound's value over the past year was supposed to have boosted exports and pulled the economy out of trouble, but exports of chemicals, ships and cars fell last month.</p> <p>However, there was an improvement in the oil balance, which posted its narrowest deficit since July 2007 of \u00a3235m after July's \u00a31.629bn deficit, which was largely due to refinery maintenance work.</p> <p>There was also good news for the Bank of England as import rates fell by 1.4% in the month to August. Howard Archer at Global Insight said that this was in \"marked contrast to the sharp rises seen through the first half of the year\". </p> <p>\"This was entirely due to lower oil prices as import prices excluding oil rose by 0.4% month on month in August,\" he said. \"While the recent retreat in oil and commodity prices will help to contain import prices, this will be countered by the sharply weaker pound.\"</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown's pledge to punish irresponsible bankers sounded increasingly hollow last night, after it became apparent that the City regulator had no immediate plans to crack down on the banks in the \u00a3500bn bail-out.</p> <p>The government is putting the onus on the Financial Services Authority to police bankers' multimillion-pound bonuses and pay. But the City regulator has no plan to issue a code of conduct, as has been suggested by ministers. </p> <p>It is not clear how the government intends to bring an end to the big-pay culture in the City.</p> <p>Brown stirred the issue again yesterday as he tried to drum up public support for the bail-out plan. \"The days of big bonuses are over. One of the conditions of us helping the banks is that we will have to reach an agreement about their executive remuneration,\" he said. \"I am angry at irresponsible behaviour. Our economy is built around people who work hard, who show effort, who take responsible decisions; and where there is excessive and irresponsible risk-taking, that has got to be punished.\"</p> <p>But asked to clarify the ways in which irresponsible risk-taking would be punished, Brown's spokesman said: \"As the prime minister has been saying consistently, what we want to see is responsible risk-taking rewarded.\"</p> <p>The bail-out plan means the taxpayer will own preference shares in the banks. These types of shares do not give investors any voting rights, so limit the influence the government can wield over the banks.</p> <p><strong>More control</strong></p> <p>But the structure of the fund-raising is not yet clear. It is thought the government had tried to devise a structure which would have given it more control over the banks, and which might have allowed the taxpayer to own ordinary shares - which do have voting rights - at a later date. A Treasury source said last night: \"Nothing is ruled in or out.\"</p> <p>Alistair Darling told the Labour party conference last month that he wanted the FSA to tackle \"the culture of huge bonuses\" in the City.</p> <p>The FSA began discussing pay deals with bankers in September, and has warned it could penalise banks which allow staff to earn big bonuses through taking big risks. Banks that encourage excessive risk-taking could be forced to put aside more capital, reducing returns to their shareholders. But the regulator has not completed this work. </p> <p>The FSA also cannot force banks to reduce their pay packages, and bankers can relocate overseas to escape any pay restrictions imposed in this country. Even requiring banks to increase their capital if they are judged to reward excessive risk-taking can be circumvented.</p> <p>Big institutional investors, who have until now been required to police boardroom pay, believe a curb on bankers' pay would be hard to achieve. \"It will be very difficult to regulate,\" said Anita Skipper, corporate governance director at Aviva Investors. \"I would first look at contracts to see if they can incorporate a link to performance, so there is a way to avoid pay for poor performance. We also have to look at quantum - total size of packages - so it is not an incentive to take risks.\" </p> <p>Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg yesterday urged the prime minister to ban directors from receiving bonuses, and called for those below board level who do get bonuses to be paid in shares which have to be held for a number of years.</p> <p>In a letter to Brown, Clegg said: \"These reforms should be for the whole industry, not merely those banks who participate in the rescue scheme. In my view they strike the right balance in allowing for innovation within banks, but remove the distorting incentives to take unjustified risks.\"</p> <p>The FSA said:\"We are conducting some thematic work, and that work hasn't been concluded\"</p> <p>Bank bosses acknowledge their pay will be lower this year because their long-term bonuses will not pay out as the banks' share prices and profits have collapsed in the credit crunch.</p>",

  "<p>On the whole, Lord Henry's own account of events - which we pick up here - seems trustworthy. He was abjectly confessing his faults rather than trying to gloss over them, and he certainly emerges from the story with very little credit, although he may have massaged the truth in a few specific places. The story begins one morning in November 1544, not long after Lord Henry's return from Boulogne. His father was on the family estates in the North of England, and so Lord Henry himself was, for the time being, head of the Neville household in London. On the morning in question, he was walking in the garden at the family house, and was approached by a man named Ninian Menville. </p> <p>Menville is one of the more unpleasant characters in this story. He was a decade or more older than Lord Henry, and was a Scot by birth and by name. It is likely that he was a Borderer from the West Marches of Scotland, for he was particularly familiar with the Maxwell family who dominated those parts. As his career makes plain, he was at home with the brutality of Border ways; and as his service to an English lord suggests, he was also at home with treachery. He was now a Neville family retainer, and a particular favourite of Lord Henry's mother, Countess Katherine. Her favour had saved his life seven years earlier, in 1537, when Menville had been facing the noose for committing a violent robbery. Countess Katherine had successfully begged for a royal pardon. Menville had continued to serve the family, as well as serving as a soldier on the Scottish Border in 1543. By 1544, he had insinuated himself into young Lord Henry's confidences. And it was on this morning that he delivered the young man to the wolves.</p> <p>As Lord Henry recalled, Menville approached him in the garden and said, My lord, I know that you are far in debt, and know not which way to pay the same; also you have lost much money by play, and daily do. </p> <p>It was, no doubt, an open secret in the Neville household that the young master was gambling, and falling deeper into debt. But Menville had a suggestion. </p> <p>But yet, if you will follow my counsel, I can devise such a way for you whereby you may both recover your loss and also win as much as shall pay your debts, and have enough to serve yourself besides from time to time. </p> <p>Who would not want to hear more? The chance to 'serve himself' would have been particularly appealing\u2014Menville, it seems, knew about the prostitutes as well as the gambling. Lord Henry asked him to elaborate. Menville then said that 'there were men that could, by art, make a ring that, whosoever had the same upon his finger, should win all that he played for'. If the dice were falling against him, magic could be used to tilt the table. </p> <p>Lord Henry was intrigued. In his defence, it should be said that the idea was not so preposterous as it seems to us. He knew that dice-play was not an honest business, and that professional gamblers hid their secrets like gold. He knew, too, that magical and quasi-magical secrets were taken seriously by some of the most brilliant minds of his age. And of course secrecy itself has a wicked allure. The jaws of the trap\u2014a little wealth, and an unscrupulous desire for a little more\u2014locked shut, eased by gullibility. The victim had been snared. Lord Henry asked to know more.</p> <p>Now began the slow and careful game of drawing him in. The main gambit was to throw seeming obstacles in his path, so that he would become more determined, more desperate, and more deeply implicated. Menville explained that he did not know of any such magicians, but added that he thought one of the servants of the household might. Lord Henry immediately summoned this servant, a man named George Stafford, and explained the idea. Stafford admitted that indeed he did know of someone with the necessary skills, but he professed to be very reluctant to get involved. Any such magical practice was, he pointed out, against the law. It was an important point. Two and a half years earlier, in 1542, Parliament had passed England's first-ever statute against magic. </p> <p>This is commonly referred to by historians as the Witchcraft Act, but it encompassed far more than witchcraft, and was properly titled the Act against Conjurations, Witchcrafts, Sorcery, and Enchantments. It prescribed death by hanging for magicians who performed any of a wide range of magical acts, and also\u2014critically\u2014for their accomplices. Stafford warned that the magician he knew might be unwilling to take the risk, and that by approaching him they might be endangering themselves. It was the 1542 Act under which Lord Henry was eventually arrested, and from the first it was an important part of the snare in which he was caught. Under the Act 's draconian terms, as soon as he consulted a magician, he had already committed a capital offence. It was a threat which could be, and was, used to buy his silence. Stafford's caution may have given Lord Henry pause, for Menville quickly intervened with a more optimistic view: What danger can it be . . . to any man as long as it is not known? And if it may be brought to pass we shall be all made by the same, and able to recompense the worker.</p> <p>The price was being made explicit to Lord Henry: a conspiracy of silence from which there would be no easy escape. Later, when the secret was out and he was facing the hangman, he lamented that he had succumbed at this point to Menville's 'crafty persuasions', but he was also honest enough to blame his own 'earnest desire'. Stafford agreed to find the magician. </p> <p>The next step was carefully stage-managed. Early the following morning, while Lord Henry was still in bed, Menville burst into his chamber to announce the news: Stafford had not only found the man but had actually brought him to the house. Lord Henry hurriedly dressed while Menville described the newcomer. He was impressed by him: he 'seemeth to be both wise and wealthy', Menville claimed, and drew particular attention to his sharply dressed appearance. He was not, Lord Henry learned, 'in a threadbare coat as commonly these unperfect multipliers be'. Multiplier was a derogatory term for sham alchemists, those who claimed to be able to multiply precious metals. Menville warned that Stafford's magician was a cut or two above such street-corner wizards, and was 'well apparelled like a cunning man in his craft '. This was a professional, an expert, whose skill commanded respect and whose dignity was in keeping with Lord Henry 's status. Indeed, Menville urged his master to hurry, 'for such rich men love not to give long attendance'. Lord Henry was already being thrown off balance and put at a disadvantage. For what it is worth, however, Menville's warnings were partly true. From the moment this magician appears on the scene, it is apparent that he was a class act. Quite apart from his fondness for fine and exotic clothing\u2014which will become familiar\u2014he was a charismatic, resourceful, and polished operator for whom poor Lord Henry was no match. </p> <p>Lord Henry scrambled hastily out of bed, and as soon as he was dressed, received the visitor, a man to whom he referred throughout by a single name: Wisdom. </p> <p>Lord Henry, flustered, tried to take control of the interview. He began by saying that he had heard of Wisdom's skill in astronomy, through which he might be able to make a ring which would give Lord Henry better luck with the dice. This talk of astronomy was, perhaps, a polite evasion. Astronomical or astrological magic was, as we shall see, the most respectable form of magic in the sixteenth century. Importantly, it was not banned under the 1542 Act. Wisdom smoothly cut across his client, explaining that he could indeed make the ring he wanted, but that he would not be using any such innocuous means. Instead, he would do so by conjuring spirits, whom he would command to perform magical services for him. This was a capital offence. Wisdom added that there were two ways that he might make such a ring: 'both by a good spirit and an evil'. Having held up this alarming pair of choices, he added reassuringly, 'But I will work it for you by the holy angels, because it shall be of the more virtue.' Nothing but the best for the old nobility. Of course, he added, this was the more expensive of the two options. </p> <p>They now began to negotiate terms. There was, again, a show of reluctance. Wisdom insisted that he made his living legitimately, as a physician, and that he did not undertake such extracurricular activities lightly. He performed magic, he said, only for his 'dear friends', and he proceeded to explain quite how dear. He emphasized that the ring would be worth a fortune to Lord Henry\u2014two or three thousand pounds before Christmas, he guessed airily. As such, he would make it only if Lord Henry would guarantee him a pension of \u00a320 a year for life. </p> <p>Wisdom must have known that this was an impossible request. It was a huge sum: enough for a man to retire on comfortably. But while he could not hope to get such an enormous amount of money, he could use the request to set the parameters of the negotiation, and this is what happened. Lord Henry 's counter-offer was itself very high, no doubt higher than anything he had been expecting to give, for he simply halved Wisdom's bid to offer a pension of \u00a310 a year. However, he also added two conditions. First, the pension would only be paid if the ring worked. Second, the payments would begin when Earl Ralph died and Lord Henry inherited the title and the incomes that went with it; a clause which suggests how much his inheritance was on Lord Henry 's mind, and which may have sowed the seeds of a later plot. In the meantime, Wisdom would have to make do simply with a share of the winnings which his ring secured. </p> <p>Wisdom accepted this offer: the deal was done, and now the game proper could begin. He told Lord Henry that work on the ring would begin the following day, only now hinting at how long the work was likely to take. He also told him that he would need some money up front 'to buy all such things as were necessary ': he asked for four marks, a mark being two-thirds of a pound. Expenses had not been part of the deal, but Lord Henry could only pay up.</p> <p>\u00b7 Edited extract from The Sorcerer's Tale by Alec Ryrie, published by OUP, priced \u00a312.99</p>",
  "<p>The Icelandic government seized control of the country's largest bank, Kaupthing, yesterday as its prime minister urged savers not to stampede to withdraw cash.</p> <p>In a further sign of the financial storm battering the country, the stock market has been closed until Monday.</p> <p>Talks are expected to begin next week over an estimated \u20ac4bn (\u00a33.1bn) loan from Russia, while the prospect of an appeal to the International Monetary Fund remains an option, according to the prime minister, Geir Haarde.</p> <p>This week Iceland took control of two other leading banks, Landsbanki and Glitnir, as Haarde warned of the risk of national bankruptcy. Yesterday the government invoked the same emergency powers to take control of Kaupthing, insisting its domestic branches, cash machines and internet operations were open for business as usual.</p> <p>The news from Reykjavik appeared to vindicate the Treasury's decision on Wednesday to take control of all UK savings deposits held in its internet savings bank, Kaupthing Edge.</p> <p>As soon as news of Landsbanki and Icesave's collapse emerged on Tuesday, Kaupthing struggled to stem the flow of cash out of its savings accounts as worried consumers sought to move their money. </p> <p>The UK Financial Services Authority quickly decided that the investment banking arm, Kaupthing Singer &amp; Friedlander, could no longer meet its obligations, so was in effect in default.</p> <p>As a result, the Treasury used its emergency powers to transfer all but 3,000 of 160,000 savings accounts to the UK arm of the Dutch bank ING Direct. A further 22,000 Heritable Bank account holders - formerly part of Landsbanki - also had their accounts transferred. </p> <p>In total, some \u00a33bn was moved to ING....#65279; Unlike Icesave's former customers, who now face a two-month wait while their compensation claims are processed, Kaupthing savers continue to have access to their money. </p> <p>At a press conference last night, Haarde asked Iceland's savers not to make attempts to battle the crisis by withdrawing large sums. \"I want to emphasise ... people [should] remain calm and understand that the transaction system is fully functioning and deposits are safe,\" he said. \"I also ask the public not to withdraw large sums of money from the banks.\"</p> <p>Announcing the decision to take control of Kaupthing, Iceland's financial supervisory authority said the bank's domestic deposits were guaranteed and that all domestic branches, call centres, cash machines and internet operations would be open for business as usual. </p> <p>\"The action taken by the [authority] is a necessary first step in achieving the objectives of the Icelandic government and parliament to ensure the continued orderly operation of domestic banking and the safety of domestic deposits,\" it said. </p> <p>In a statement, Kaupthing said creditors had pointed out that Kaupthing Singer &amp; Friedlander's situation put the parent bank in technical default of its loan agreements. </p> <p>\"It did not matter that the parent company had sufficient liquidity and its position was solid,\" Kaupthing said, adding that the entire board had resigned.</p> <p>Haarde clarified at the news conference that although the state had taken control of the banks, it had not assumed responsibility for their assets and obligations. He added that the government had full confidence in the board of the central bank, responding to a politician's call for it to be dismissed over its handling of the crisis. </p> <p>The retailer Baugur, which has its roots in Iceland but which has built a British empire including the toy shop Hamleys and the department store group House of Fraser, said its operations would be unaffected by the banking crisis.</p>",
  "<p>US intelligence agencies believe the war in Afghanistan is in \"a downward spiral\", sparking an urgent strategy rethink by the Bush administration as it enters its last three months in office, it was reported yesterday.</p> <p>The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Afghanistan, a joint report by America's 16 spy agencies, is not due to be published until after next month's presidential election, but a draft version was leaked to US newspapers calling into question the coherence of US and Nato policy. </p> <p>The document also places considerable blame on Hamid Karzai, the Afghan president, for failing to control corruption in his government. It also points to the destabilising impact of the booming opium trade, which now accounts for at least half the national economy.</p> <p>The White House has ordered a review of its policy and sent a team to Kabul led by Lieutenant General Douglas Lute, the president's military adviser on Afghanistan, to assess the situation.</p> <p>\"We have had a tough summer. There is no doubt about it,\" a Nato source told the Guardian. \"There are concerns, and we would share concerns the NIE has identified for better Afghan governance. We have said for some time the solution is political and not military.\"</p> <p>The Afghan government has been reported to be holding talks with the Taliban, hosted by Saudi Arabia, but it is unclear whether those contacts would lead to comprehensive peace talks. </p> <p>Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, has argued that Nato troops must confront Afghanistan's drug traffickers directly. The job has been left to Afghanistan's poorly trained and under-equipped police force. \"Part of the problem that we face is that the Taliban make somewhere between $60m and $80m or more a year from the drug trafficking,\" Gates said at a Nato meeting in Budapest yesterday. </p> <p>\"... if we have the opportunity to go after drug lords and drug laboratories and try to interrupt this flow of cash to the Taliban, that seems to me like a legitimate security endeavour.\"</p> <p>A proposed counter-narcotics mandate for Nato in Afghanistan divides opinion in Whitehall, putting the Foreign Office at odds with the Ministry of Defence. </p> <p>The Foreign Office welcomed the move yesterday, saying Britain had been requesting it for years, in the face of resistance from some European allies. But British military officials were more sceptical, saying such operations would require the deployment of more forces. </p> <p>\"You can put your troops into counter-insurgency or you can go after the [drug trafficking] middleman but you can't do both,\" said a defence source.</p> <p>British officers see the benefits of targeting drug laboratories and trafficking kingpins. But they argue that such operations should be undertaken primarily by Afghan forces, with Nato providing support. British diplomats are keen to emphasise that counter-narcotics efforts to date have brought results. They point to UN figures showing a 19% reduction in land under poppy cultivation last year, and a 6% fall in opium production. (The discrepancy between the two figures is explained by higher yields per hectare). </p> <p>The NIE on Afghanistan appears destined to become an election issue in the final weeks of the contest between Barack Obama and John McCain. </p> <p>The Pentagon plans to send another three brigades, up to 14,000 troops, to bolster the 33,000-strong US force there now, but in Budapest yesterday, US officials were urging their allies not to pull out when the American reinforcements arrive.</p> <p>Meanwhile the United Arab Emirates has quietly become the 41st country contributing to the coalition effort in Afghanistan, although it is not clear what resources it intends to contribute.</p> <p>The draft NIE on Afghanistan illustrates a darkening mood in western capitals. It follows a leaked French diplomatic dispatch quoting the British ambassador to Kabul, Sherard Cowper-Coles, as saying US strategy there had failed. The foreign secretary, David Miliband, said the report had \"garbled\" the British position.</p>",
  "<p>Zimbabwe's official inflation rate has surged to 231m per cent as the opposition appealed to South Africa's former president, Thabo Mbeki, to rescue the historic power-sharing deal he brokered last month with President Robert Mugabe. </p> <p>Hyperinflation has contributed to widespread food shortages, prompting the World Food Programme to launch an appeal yesterday to feed 5 million Zimbabweans, some of whom it said are reduced to living on wild fruits. It said more than 80% of the population was surviving on less than \u00a31 a day, and nearly half of all Zimbabweans were chronically malnourished. </p> <p>The latest official inflation rate, for July, is 20 times higher than a month earlier. But independent economists who have accurately estimated the true rate in the past say that inflation this month will run into the trillions. That has forced the government to allow shops this week to begin accepting US dollars and the South African rand, because the Zimbabwe dollar is all but worthless. </p> <p>Those shops still selling in local currency raise their prices two or three times a day. Some price in \"units\" and display an ever rising rate of Zimbabwe dollars per unit. But finding cash is almost impossible because the government cannot afford to print notes to keep pace with inflation, and the bank limit on daily withdrawals is far less than the cost of a loaf of bread.</p> <p>Millions of Zimbabweans now bypass money altogether and barter what they can grow for other essentials. Others have almost no food, after another catastrophic crop failure largely attributed to the economic crisis and the seizure of white-owned farms. </p> <p>The WFP yesterday appealed for $140m to feed 5 million Zimbabweans, half the population. \"Millions of Zimbabweans have run out of food or are surviving on one meal a day and the crisis is going to get much worse,\" said Mustapha Darboe, the WFP regional director.</p> <p>The latest inflation figures and deepening food crisis will increase pressure on Mugabe to stop stalling over the composition of a new power-sharing government with the prime minister designate, Morgan Tsvangirai. The president has insisted on keeping control of all key cabinet posts, including security ministries such as the army and police, as well as the finance portfolio, even though foreign donors have stressed that there will be no aid to revive the economy unless it falls under Tsvangirai's control. </p> <p>Tsvangirai said yesterday that the talks were deadlocked and called for the intervention of Mbeki, who was forced to resign as South Africa's president last month. \"We have asked him to come over and he has said he will come over,\" he said.</p> <p>Tsvangirai added that he retained confidence in the agreement. \"We are confident about the potential of the deal,\" he said. \"In the process of implementation we have hit an impasse, but not on fundamental contents of the deal.\"</p> <p>\"Unfortunately no progress has been made ... to bring the Zimbabwean people to the beginning of the path of recovery. Instead the economic crisis has worsened. We now live in an environment characterised by hunger, starvation, and we are days away from seeing people dropping dead on the streets.\"</p> <p>Mugabe signed what he called a \"humiliating\" agreement surrendering many of his powers only because his government had no solution to the problems afflicting Zimbabwe, and that has not changed. Its attempt to curb inflation with enforced price reductions only drove trade on to the black market. </p> <p>The central bank removed 10 zeros from the currency in August after rapid devaluation forced it to print Z$100bn notes that were worth only 8p on the street when it was scrapped. But the new currency continued the free fall as it dropped from about Z$100 to the pound two months ago to Z$2m to the pound last week. </p> <p>Severe cash shortages had meant that many people could at least use electronic bank accounts as a means of payment, using a parallel market rate. But the government blocked such transfers last week, claiming they were used for illicit exchange deals.</p>",
  "<p>The moment when the 11-year-old Liverpool schoolboy Rhys Jones was shot as he crossed a pub car park on his way home from football practice, filmed by a CCTV camera, was shown to a jury at the city's crown court yesterday at the start of the trial of an 18-year-old youth accused of his murder.</p> <p>Sean Mercer, allegedly a member of the Croxteth Crew gang, denies murdering Rhys, who the court heard was shot in the back with a Smith and Wesson revolver.</p> <p>Rhys's father, Stephen Jones, looked strained and clutched a handkerchief as the indistinct and jerky footage from surveillance cameras was shown. A few moments earlier his wife Melanie, who had cradled their son in her arms as he died, left the court in tears as the prosecution began to describe his final moments. </p> <p>Rhys's shooting in August last year, in front of early evening drinkers sitting outside on a sunny evening, caused national outrage and prompted extensive media coverage of one of the youngest victims of apparent teenage gang rivalries.</p> <p>The prosecutor, Neil Flewitt, QC, told the jury that Rhys, on his way home from football practice on August 22, had ended up \"walking into the line of fire\" in a war between the Croxteth Crew and rivals from neighbouring Norris Green, known as the Strand Gang or Nogga Dogs.</p> <p>The film extracts, taken from several cameras around the Fir Tree pub on a residential estate, an area once used as the model for the television soap opera Brookside, showed a youth, dressed in black, ride up on a mountain bike and allegedly fire three shots across the car park at members of the rival gang. </p> <p>One shot could be seen hitting the window of a parked car; another sent up dust from an ornamental wishing well. Rhys could be seen starting to cross the car park, then turning as if in reaction to the first explosion and falling to the ground. After the shots, the black-clad youth could be seen cycling away at speed.</p> <p>Mr Flewitt said: \"The overwhelming impression gained by the witnesses was that the gunman was a pale young man dressed mainly in black. He was wearing a hooded top and riding a predominantly black mountain bike.</p> <p>\"The witnesses describe the gunman standing astride his bicycle with both hands stretched out in front of him as if aiming his gun across the car park.\"</p> <p>He told the court Rhys was already in cardiac arrest before an ambulance crew arrived. He was hit once behind the left shoulder as he turned. The bullet exited through the front of his neck.</p> <p>In the dock, behind glass screens and separated by prison staff, the defendants watched the footage impassively, with Mercer, dressed in a black shirt, occasionally slightly shaking his head.</p> <p>The jury was told Mercer was originally arrested three days after the shooting and that aspects of his story of cycling in search of his friends were borne out by other CCTV cameras, but a mother of one of the juveniles had said he had left her house while the soap opera Emmerdale was still showing - the programme ended a few minutes after the shooting took place.</p> <p>The prosecution case will include evidence of conversations between defendants and their parents, derived from police bugging of their homes. Mobile phone records were said also to indicate collusion between defendants.</p> <p>Opening the prosecution in a trial which is expected to last up to two months, Neil Flewitt QC told the jury: \"Rhys Jones was the innocent victim of a long-running feud between rival gangs ... the murder was yet another and perhaps more tragic example of mindless and indiscriminate violence between the Croxteth Crew and the Strand Gang.\"</p> <p>He said there had been 70 incidents of criminal damage arising from the feud in the last four years. A year before the boy's murder a member of the Strand Gang, Liam Smith, had been murdered outside a prison by members of the Croxteth gang.</p> <p>Mercer was said to have been looking for a rival gang member, Wayne Brady, who had been seen in the area minutes earlier. Mr Flewitt said: \"Sean Mercer's interest in Brady was not limited to general gang rivalry ... he had once or twice said ... 'Brady's going to get it.' \"</p> <p>Six other young men, three of whom cannot be named as they are still juveniles, have also denied charges relating to the shooting.</p> <p>An associate of Mercer, James Yates, 20, and a 17-year-old and 16-year-old youth are charged with disposing of the murder weapon, alleged to have been a 90-year-old Smith and Wesson .455 revolver.</p> <p>Gary Kays and Melvin Coy, both 25, are accused of providing transport for Mercer after the shooting. All five are further accused of disposing of clothing and the 16-year-old also with disposing of the mountain bike used in the attack. A further 17-year-old is accused of moving the weapon and another gun. The prosecution case continues tomorrow.</p>",
  "<p>It is clear that lessons have been learned after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewishamilton\">Lewis Hamilton's</a> first season. The McLaren driver won brilliantly here last season, only to squander a 17-point lead in the final two races. \"You learn how to deal with it, all the different pressures you face at the end of the year,\" said the 23-year-old Briton, who now has a seven-point lead with three to go, beginning with Sunday's Japanese grand prix. </p> <p>\"Because last season was my first in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone\">F1</a> I was in a different frame of mind. I was enjoying myself so much that I wasn't so focused on the championship. If it happened it happened but if it didn't it didn't. The fact was that I had reached F1, won races and shown I was competitive. </p> <p>\"This year I've knuckled down even more and taken all last year's things into account, and I'm much more focused on the title. I've taken a longer-term view throughout the season and that has made me stronger ahead of the final three races.\"</p> <p>Hamilton accepts that the final outcome may be down to influences over which a driver has no control, such as the pit-stop chaos which cost his main rival, Ferrari's Felipe Massa, a certain win in Singapore two weeks ago. </p> <p>\"The last race was bloody hard,\" said Hamilton, who finished third. \"I think Felipe has shown just how strong he is this year. He has made serious improvements since last season and is really doing a fantastic job. He's extracting the most from his car and his team. He's been my hardest competitor this year.\"</p> <p>Massa has frequently beaten his team-mate, Kimi Raikkonen, this season. \"Perhaps we should be surprised, because Kimi is the world champion,\" Hamilton added. \"He drove fantastically last year and he's had some bad luck this time, but then we all have. We've all had pretty much the same amount of non-finishes, the same share of misfortune and mistakes.\"</p> <p>Massa's major misfortune was to have his engine blow up three laps from victory in Hungary. It was a rare failure at a time when engine specifications are frozen for five years in the interest of cost-cutting and reliability. But Max Mosley, the president of the FIA, motor sport's governing body, and Bernie Ecclestone, the formula one rights-holder, want to make greater savings in the light of an impending world-wide recession. </p> <p>Standard engines to a detailed specification drawn up by the FIA are proposed. The manufacturers have shown signs of accepting, but only if they can build and badge the engines. Using an off-the-shelf product would not be acceptable to the likes of Honda and Mercedes-Benz, which thrive on the engineering challenge. </p> <p>In a sport usually driven by selfishness and secrecy, the teams have begun to work together by forming the Formula One Teams Association (Fota) and trying to agree on proposals. As ever, they are working under the threat of perhaps unpopular changes being implemented by the FIA if a consensus cannot be reached.</p> <p>\"It's true we spend a lot, definitely more than should be necessary to put on a show like this,\" BMW's director of motor sport, Mario Theissen, told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"With the economic crisis worldwide, it's a strong incentive to look into it.</p> <p>\"Constructive discussions have already taken place between the FIA and Fota. The teams are preparing a proposal for future technical regulations aimed at sharply reducing costs and the hope is that we can produce a sensible set of regulations acceptable to the FIA. The problem is that even though all the teams are involved, not all are coming from the same angle.\"</p>",
  "<p>Britain once fought cod wars against Iceland, and lost - now the battle is a banking one, the consequence of the ruin of a country. Yesterday it led to the incredible sight of the Icelandic prime minister attempting to explain to British and Dutch journalists where all the money has gone. He sounded like a bankrupt builder fobbing off angry clients, not the leader of a nation that was allowed to become one of Britain's bigger overseas investors. </p> <p>Gordon Brown spoke strongly about Iceland's disgrace yesterday, threatening legal retribution, although it is hard to see how that could work. The British government even distorted anti-terror legislation to freeze Icelandic bank assets here. But that will do little to stop the loss of millions of pounds from local government, police and charity accounts held with Icelandic banks. This episode may appear minor set against the vast chaos of the City, but - as with the collapse of Britain's great regional banks - it takes the pain of the crash into places that never expected to feel it so directly: yesterday more than 100 authorities reported deposits in failed Icelandic banks totalling more than \u00a3800m. The government wants councils to deal with the consequences, although there are signs that it is ready to offer essential help. Private savers took risks too, yet ministers have protected them. A situation where bankers get billions, but keep their jobs, while councils take the hit, cannot be justified.</p> <p>Whatever professional wisdom may say, this is not an argument that the government can win. If councils are not to be compensated in full then other short-term aid must be arranged for those that find they cannot pay bills, or must push up council tax to unsustainable levels. The priority is to unearth the scale of this particular disaster, but it is clear that it is large enough to hit certain places hard. Northumberland has lost \u00a323m, Nottingham \u00a342m, even little Wyre Forest \u00a39m.</p> <p>The test for all political leaders now is whether they can rise to the priorities this bewildering time has thrust upon them. If the government is seen to hesitate over issues such as council deposits, while tolerating some of the pleading of a City culture that produced disaster, voters will have reason to be angry. </p> <p>The prime minister has been decisive this week and Labour has reason to give thanks that he did not fall before the conferences, to glower from the backbenches at an anxious interim leader. This could prove a revolutionary time - with the scrapping of old ideas, not just about finance but about things such as 42 days' detention. Labour's fortunes have not been rescued yet, however. The cheers for Mr Brown in the Commons on Wednesday were real. But Iceland is a sign of the deep chill still to come.</p>",
  "<p>US vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin faces possible censure today with the conclusion of an investigation into allegations that she committed a serious abuse of power by sacking the head of the Alaskan police force when he refused to become involved in a family feud.</p> <p>Republicans last night failed in suppressing the report after Alaska's supreme court refused to shut down the investigation. Palin is expected to be criticised for failing to cooperate with the inquiry into the Troopergate affair, so called because she is alleged to have dismissed the state's public safety commissioner, Walt Monegan, after he refused to sack her former brother-in-law, a state trooper. It is unclear whether the investigation will find that Palin, the governor of Alaska, is guilty of firing Monegan because he refused to move against the trooper, Mike Wooten, or whether it will accept her argument that she had other reasons to dismiss him.</p> <p>Palin's husband, Todd, attempted to shoulder much of the blame for the pressure Monegan faced after refusing to fire Wooten; in a statement to the investigation on Wednesday he said: \"I make no apologies for wanting to protect my family and wanting to publicise the injustice of a violent trooper keeping his badge.\" </p> <p>He said he had never instructed Monegan to sack Wooten, but his statement, made public by his lawyer, conceded: \"We had a lot of conversations about a guy who threatened my family and verbally assaulted my daughter.\" His wife, he said, had finally told him to \"drop it\".</p> <p>Stephen Branchflower, a former prosecutor who is conducting the investigation on behalf of the Alaskan state legislature, is known to have examined emails from Mrs Palin to Monegan, including one complaining that \"this trooper is still out on the street, in fact he's been promoted\".</p> <p>Some Palin aides are also expected to face censure. They appear to have been unaware that Monegan's Department of Public Safety (DPS) routinely recorded incoming telephone calls, with the result that Branchflower was able to obtain recordings of a number of conversations.</p> <p>He is also thought to have obtained details of emails sent between Palin, her husband and a number of senior officials in her administration.</p> <p>The investigation has focused on events leading up to Monegan's sacking last July. Wooten and the governor's younger sister, Molly McCann, had been through an acrimonious divorce and child custody dispute, during which members of Palin's family had accused him of a range of crimes and disciplinary offences. In March 2006 Wooten was found guilty of a number of offences, including threatening behaviour and shooting his stepson with a Taser stun-gun on a low power setting. He was briefly suspended and given a final written warning, but after Palin came into office nine months later, her aides are alleged to have repeatedly urged Monegan to reopen the case. Monegan says his refusal to do so cost him his job.</p> <p>Branchflower will present his conclusions today at a meeting of Alaskan state senators and representatives.</p>",

A man falls in love with a fairy. He is so smitten, this man, that he cups the little fairy in the palm of his hand, looks into her eyes, and says: \"I love you. I want to marry you.\" Are you laughing yet? Probably not - maybe because the joke has lost a little in translation from its original language. In British Sign Language (BSL), the word \"fairy\" involves standing the index and middle finger of one hand on the upturned palm of the other, as if to represent the fairy's legs. But the word \"marry\" requires flipping the second hand over - which removes the ground from beneath the fairy's feet and sends her plummeting unromantically to the floor.</p> <p>I am in Dublin to see John Smith, Britain's only BSL comedian. Smith, who is from Nottingham, has been hired to perform by the Irish Deaf Society as part of the Dublin comedy festival. I am here to see how comedy works in sign-language, how Smith's act compares with the spoken comedy I am used to seeing as the Guardian's stand-up critic.</p> <p>Much of Smith's act is about the gulf between the hearing and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/deaf\">deaf</a> worlds; about the ways, from subtle to screamingly obvious, in which society excludes deaf people. But I have already had an inverse sense of that, in the difficulty I have encountered in organising my visit to his show. It proved far trickier than expected to find an interpreter to sit with me at the gig. Clearly, there are not many to go around - a problem compounded by the fact that Smith uses BSL, whereas the local interpreters use the similar, but not identical, Irish Sign Language.</p> <p>Eventually, I find Susan Foley-Cave, who has worked with Dublin's deaf community for more than a decade and, by a happy coincidence, undertook academic research on deaf humour. (The fairy joke comes from her.) But my problems do not end here. Foley-Cave and I need to sit together, so she can translate Smith's act directly into my shell-like lug-hole. But we have been issued non-adjacent seats. When I try to explain this to the (deaf) ushers, I hear myself addressing them slowly, loudly and probably obnoxiously, like a British tourist on the Costa del Sol.</p> <p>Most of the rest of the audience (if that word applies) are deaf. Foley-Cave knows almost all of them: Dublin's deaf community is out in force, which suggests that shows dedicated to this constituency are infrequent events. I feel incongruous- as, perhaps, do deaf people at conventional gigs. But Foley-Cave tells me not to worry. Yes, I might be made fun of: deaf comedy usually pokes fun at hearing people. But it is worse for her, because the most common butt of deaf jokes, the BSL-speakers' bete noir, is the interpreter. One gag features congregants at a funeral paying tribute to the deceased, a kingpin of the disabled community. One man is moved to cast his wheelchair into the grave, another his hearing aid, a third his walking stick. The BSL-speaker, eager to follow suit, duly slings his interpreter into the hole.</p> <p>I will not be cracking any jokes about Foley-Cave; she is my lifeline tonight. To a hearing punter like me, the event already feels unusual, askew in some way, before it even begins. Maybe it is the silence in the bar beforehand, where conversations are taking place with hands, not tongues. Or the fact that the houselights in the auditorium (another word that no longer applies) do not dim when Smith steps onstage. When his act begins, it seems scarcely more familiar. If I expected his comedy to be broadly decipherable - that even without an interpreter I might get the gist - I was wide of the mark.</p> <p>Chatting to Smith before the show with the help of another interpreter, he told me that he uses \"a lot of facial expressions, body language and very big movements\". His favourite comedian, he said (using the distinctive \"jus' like that\" gesture we might all deploy to describe him) was Tommy Cooper. Onstage, Smith elicits a cheer by referencing Rowan Atkinson as Mr Bean. There is an overlap between hearing and deaf comedy, and it is in this field of slapstick, clowning and knockabout. Deaf audiences might appreciate Laurel and Hardy, Men in Coats and, to some extent, Lee Evans, on the same level as their hearing counterparts.</p> <p>But Smith is doing something a little different. Yes, his facial expressions are totally legible to a hearing viewer, and they often register the dismay or indignation you see on most stand-ups' faces. And yes, there are mime sequences I can interpret. One is about deaf people dancing. The dance ends with Smith cradling a woman in his arms - but when he wants to whisper a sweet nothing to her, he must use his hands to do so, and (like the fairy) she duly tumbles to the ground.</p> <p>But in most cases, Smith's signing is integral to his meaning, and I need Foley-Cave to follow even his most cartoonish jokes. Many are enacted using roleplay, which is BSL's key device for reporting second-person speech or action. Onstage, Smith enacts a deaf person working in air traffic control; a deaf man having sex while wearing a miner's headlamp (so he can turn out the bedside light and still be able to \"speak\"); and various knives and forks flying across the room to adhere to a deaf man's cochlear implants (which contain magnets). Smith does not like cochlear implants, and at one point smashes a hearing aid on the floor with a mallet, which divides his audience. Implants are a powder-keg issue in deaf circles, because some see them as a \"cure\" for a condition that should not be deemed an affliction in the first place.</p> <p>There is a political edge to Smith's act, unsurprisingly for a man who sued the factory in which he once worked for disability discrimination, and who later served at the Rotherham Deaf Advice Centre. There are embittered jokes about his memories of school, where deafness was treated like a deficiency and BSL ignored. (Smith is estranged from many of his family, who will not acknowledge BSL and insist on speaking to him.) There is a joke about sign-interpreted TV being scheduled in the wee hours of the night, which sees Smith speeding up sex with his partner in order not to miss the only telly shows he will be able fully to understand.</p> <p>It is fascinating to see Smith's caricature of the hearing person, a sort of waffling drone burbling out of his mouth, far less expressive than the vivacious gestural symphony that is BSL. But what marks his act out from much deaf humour, says Foley-Cave, is that he is lampooning deaf people too: their tight-fistedness, their burping, slurping disregard for propriety; their garrulous solidarity. She compares him to Chris Rock, who mocks black people in his stand-up as well as whites. But Smith's fun-poking is more affectionate than Rock's, and his satire is not exactly impartial: at one point, he appears in a superhero's cape, punching the air and shouting, \"Deaf power!\"</p> <p>The audience seem delighted by this; several punters gleefully parrot the phrase in the foyer later. \"Deaf people can understand and empathise with my work,\" Smith said earlier. To represent deaf stories and deaf concerns in comedy, he believes, is liberating. It releases the tensions inherent in these people's lives (\"Deaf people are treated like they're stupid,\" he says. \"You're constantly having to fight and challenge with hearing people,\") and both allows them to laugh and to know that they, too, are funny. \"I can be a role model to these people,\" says Smith, \"definitely.\"</p> <p>But, even though his act is about, and for, deaf people, and even though watching it was for me a sometimes alienating experience, I left feeling that Smith's BSL humour was not so different from comedy everywhere. The more Smith jokes about deaf behaviour - about how deaf people are greedy, money-conscious, rude and lovable - the more they resemble, well, everyone else. As I once wrote about the venerable US stand-up Jackie Mason, \"He uses the word 'Jew' where others might use 'person'.\" The same goes for Smith and deaf people. At the start of this night of sign-language stand-up, the difference between myself and the rest of the audience felt vast. By the end - and this is what's great about comedy - I couldn't help noticing how much we had in common.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338447661\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1846615648_gdn-nat-080922-es-jeffries-interview-04-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Marcel Hirshman holds two hands horizontally in front of him and sweeps them together repeatedly. \"That can mean 'arrangement',\" he says. \"But it can also mean 'having sex'. And there's a third meaning: in American Sign Language, it can also mean Coke. Because the signs are so similar, there's always a chance you could be misunderstood.\" So I could try to order a drink and wind up getting more than I bargained for? \"If you were lucky,\" says Hirshman with an impish sidelong glance.</p> <p>And then there is the story, Hirshman tells me, of what happened one day when a Scotsman and an Englishwoman were having a chat using British Sign Language (BSL). During the conversation, the man wanted to know if the woman was embarrassed. So, by scratching his cheek with two fingers in a gesture evoking the rush of blood to the face (a BSL sign for embarrassed), he asked her. He thought it was a perfectly innocent question. She didn't. Where she came from, the same gesture meant prostitute. \"So he was asking her, she thought, if she was a prostitute. She was really upset,\" he recalls. </p> <p>There's another story about the rude signed version of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. At some baby signing classes recently, teachers who were not very skilled in BSL made up a sign for the word \"diamond\" which looked a lot like the BSL for vagina. So they wound up signing not \"Like a diamond in the sky\", but \"Like a vagina in the sky\".</p> <p>But Hirshman insists that signing has many advantages over spoken English. \"For hearing people, it's rude to point. In signing, it isn't - it's part of our language structure. It's more economical and more specific.\" He gives me an example. \"In English you might say: 'The newspaper is on the table.' But which table? In sign language, I'd point at the table and sign 'newspaper', so you know immediately where this is.\"</p> <p>Hirshman is an intriguing guide through some of the droller corners of sign languages and how they differ from spoken languages. If you are an insomniac hearing person or a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/deaf\">deaf</a> TV viewer, you may well have seen him signing BBC TV programmes -he signed both the Catherine Tate Show and Little Britain (of which more later), as well as some football matches on ITV. The son of deaf parents, Hirshman, 36, is married to a deaf partner and has two children who are not deaf. Rosabella is two and Olivier is soon to be one. \"My daughter has started to sign more and more complicated sentences. Some people say, 'What about her speech, what about her vocabulary?', but I don't care about any of that. When she's out of the house or when she's watching TV, she'll pick up English. It's not a problem.\" What was Rosabella's first word? \"Mummy, of course! She signed it. Olivier recently signed his first word, which was 'Daddy'. I liked that.\"</p> <p>During our conversation (which is mostly conducted with Hirshman signing to an interpreter), he shows me a few signs for British towns. Peterborough, for example, is signed by brushing one's finger over one's nose - an allusion to the nickname of the town's football club, the Posh. Derby is signed by drawing your hands in spiral motions around your temples - the nickname for Derby County FC, you see, is the Rams. Sheffield, venerable heartland of British steel manufacture, is signed with fingers simulating knives. </p> <p>Disappointingly, Manchester isn't signed by adding the sign for \"man\" to the sign for \"chest\", but by finger-spelling M and C. Similarly, Newcastle isn't signed with \"new\" and \"castle\" but by finger-spelling N and C. How is London signed? Hirshman circles one ear with his index finger, which I take to be the universal sign for madness. But it isn't. \"I think it originated because in London women wore hats with bows tied around their throat. So originally the same gesture was made at the level of the throat. Now it's higher, around the ear, and indicates that London is noisy.\" Perhaps the most bizarre sign for a town name, though, is for Preston, which Hirshman signs with a gesture signifying a priest's collar.</p> <p>\"For a long time there weren't really deaf signs for towns because there wasn't much travelling,\" he says. \"Now if someone asks where you're from, it's not enough to use the sign for 'here'.\"</p> <p>BSL is the preferred language of 50,000 deaf Britons and involves the use of both hands to sign, as well as very developed facial expressions and body language. But not all national sign languages are like this. \"American Sign Language is horrible to me because there's hardly any facial expression,\" says Hirshman. \"It's all done with the hands. But for me facial expression is so important in expressing what I mean. If, say, I want to tell you, 'I like a car', in signing I'd say it by going, 'Car, like' - and 'like' would be expressed in this way . . .\" He nods his head slowly, sticks out his lips and raises his eyebrows suggestively. I get what he means very quickly. </p> <p>It's often more economical than English: for example, hearing people will sometimes describe who was speaking in a conversation by saying \"he said, she said\", but in sign language this can be communicated simply by shifting one's shoulders to indicate who was talking. \"Irish Sign Language, American Sign Language and lots of European ones use only one hand for finger-spelling, while BSL uses two.\" It's strange, I tell Hirshman, for an English speaker to find out that BSL is not closely related to Irish or American sign languages. ISL, intriguingly, is hardly related to English at all, but influenced very heavily by French Sign Language. BSL's closest relatives are Australian Sign Language (known as Auslan) and New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL). Together, they form a family called BANZSL.</p> <p>Even more unexpected are the regional variations within BSL. \"In most of the country, </p> <p>'car' is signed like this,\" says Hirshman. He holds up two fists, at 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock, and wobbles them slightly - the steering wheel of a moving car. \"But in Newcastle, it's signed like this.\" Hirshman holds his hands in the same positions, but with the thumbs and forefingers of each hand together and extends the other fingers horizontally. To me, I tell Hirshman, that looks like you're offering me a fight. \"That's what I think it looks like, too. But in the north-east that's how it is.\" Then Hirshman shows me how they sign \"news\" in Yorkshire and how they do it in the rest of the country, and lots of other regional differences in BSL - they include the signs for evening, afternoon, football and rugby. \"About 80% of BSL is unified,\" he explains, but the rest is regional. \"It's like you [British hearing people] say 'bath' differently in different parts of the country.\"</p> <p>Like anyone trying to learn a foreign language, I want to know how to swear in BSL. \"I think all our swear words are very similar.We don't really have any of our own, just signings of English.\" He shows me the signs for \"shit\" and \"fuck\". They are quite graphic, though not as rude as I had hoped. And then Hirshman shows me the sign for \"bollocks\", holding two cupped hands in front of him and letting them dangle heavily, accompanying the gesture with a sardonic look of disbelief. I had picked up the meaning without the interpreter translating. Indeed, during the interview a lot of the direct interaction between Hirshman and me involves eye contact and facial expression - which makes the experience strangely, though hardly unpleasantly, intimate.</p> <p>Translating English into BSL is a tricky business, as Hirshman has found in his career as a TV signer for hit programmes such as the Catherine Tate Show. How, I ask, Hirshman, do you sign the catchphrase \"Am I bovvered?\" He shows me: it's hard to convey in print, but very funny (at least I think so, you can check out his version on our online video interview). But that wasn't the most difficult TV signing task Hirshman had to perform. \"In Little Britain, some of the jokes rely on audible humour which is very difficult to sign.\" An example, please. \"I had to sign the sketch where an old woman pees herself and part of the joke is that you can hear the pee splashing on the floor, which is obviously an auditory joke and so not a deaf joke at all.\" So what did you do? \"I had to imagine myself as a hearing person and convey to deaf people watching the programme that there is the noise of pee in the sketch. And in the sketch with the carer and the man in the wheelchair, I had to convey that the carer talks in a very simplistic way by the way I signed it.\" </p> <p>Hirshman tells me he is aware that deaf signers on TV are exasperating to some people. \"Hearing people think: 'Who is this person standing in front of the programme I want to watch?' And deaf people often think: 'The signer should be in the programme rather than outside it.'\" So you're resented by everyone? Hirshman gives me the impish sidelong glance again - I don't think he minds too much.</p> <p>BSL was recognised by the government only four years ago, after centuries in which the language was virtually ignored officially. \"We were so very grateful,\" says Hirshman, dryly. \"Actually, it hasn't made much difference in practice. What has made a difference to us is the Disabilities Discrimination Act. That has resulted in things like this.\" Hirshman produces from his bag a DVD of the Highway Code designed for deaf people. What was wrong with the written Highway Code? \"Our preferred language is BSL, not English. We were being discriminated against.\" </p> <p>But that makes the deaf community sound less like a disability group and more like beleaguered speakers of a minority language, like Welsh or Gaelic, I suggest. \"Exactly. Actually, we'll use both - our disability status and our minority cultural status - to help ourselves. </p> <p>But you're right: we are often more like a disadvantaged cultural minority than anything else\".</p>",

Vodafone has made a non-binding offer to pay Telkom 22.5bn rand (\u00a31.5bn) for a further 15% of Vodacom, which would take its stake to 65%. Under the proposed deal, its remaining 35% of shares would be floated. Vodafone hopes by taking control of Vodacom it will bolster its presence in Africa. Earlier this year it snapped up a controlling stake in Ghana's third-largest mobile phone company and also has operations in Kenya and Egypt.<br><strong>Chris Tryhorn</strong></p> <h2>LVMH toasts Chinese and Russian drinkers</h2> <p>LVMH has posted a 10% increase in quarterly underlying revenues, rising to \u20ac12bn (\u00a39.5bn) for the three months to September 30 - slightly ahead of analysts' forecasts despite the worsening financial crisis. The strongest growth came from the French group's fashion and leather division, including Louis Vuitton. Mo\u00ebt Hennessy, in which the London-listed Diageo has a 34% stake, saw sales rise 5%, after stripping out currency changes.

The company said yesterday that Sony BMG, Warner and Universal would all be making tracks and albums available. The other major, EMI, has been on board since the service was launched in February, as have a number of independent labels.

The German government said yesterday that the October 27 timetable under which the initial public offering was scheduled had been disrupted by the global financial turmoil. The finance ministry insisted the sale of a 24.9% stake in Deutsche Bahn's mobility logistics unit would go ahead but did not give a new date. The company had been hoping a sale would raise \u20ac4.5bn (\u00a33.6bn), though analysts had been scaling back their forecasts towards \u20ac4bn ahead of yesterday's announcement of the delay.<br><strong>Mark Milner</strong></p> <h2>450 managers at BA take voluntary redundancy</h2> <p>British Airways said yesterday that 450 managerial jobs were being axed as part of a cost-cutting drive.

  "<p>Roger Goldby's first feature film as writer-director is very much a mixed bag. On the plus side, you have uniformly good performances all round, especially from leads Anne-Marie Duff and Ralf Little and oldies Frank Finlay and Phyllida Law, and realistically portrayed messy family lives. On the downside, it's just too flimsy even for the home cinema, and when you have leads as good as Duff and Little (and all that audience goodwill for their years of TV slavery in the Gallagher and Royle clans) it's a shameful waste to have them merely exchange goofy grins when they meet. Even bland rom-coms allow the central couple to have a relationship of some kind. It's not short at 110 minutes but the material feels like it needs a six-part series to give Duff and Little some dramatic fat to chew on.</p>",
  "<p>The world is moving closer to the final abolition of the death penalty, according to the latest figures published to coincide with World Day against the Death Penalty yesterday. At present, five countries are responsible for almost all the state executions carried out in the past year. </p> <p>So far, 137 countries have abolished the death penalty in law or practice, while 60 retain its use, usually for people convicted of murder. At least 1,252 people were known to have been executed in 24 countries in 2007. Of all the executions in 2007, 88% took place in China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the US. </p> <p>By the end of 2007, 91 countries had abolished the death penalty for all crimes, with Albania, the Cook Islands and Rwanda all recently abandoning capital punishment, said Reprieve, which represents death-row prisoners around the world. \"The reality is that, despite the progress that has been made over the last 18 months, there are still thousands of people being executed every year around the world,\" said Clive Stafford Smith, director of Reprieve. </p> <p>In Europe, only Belarus retains capital punishment. Abandonment of the death penalty is a prerequisite for joining the EU. The US is the only country in the Americas to have carried out any executions since 2003 but the 53 executions in 2006 represented the lowest annual total for a decade, and death sentences continue to drop from a peak in the mid-1990s.</p> <p>China makes by far the most use of the penalty. \"Asia leads the way globally as the continent that carries out the most executions,\" said Amnesty International's UK director, Kate Allen. \"The number of executions carried out by China last year makes them the world's No 1 'executioner'. This year we have seen a noticeable increase in the use of the death penalty in Japan. Executions in that country are typically shrouded in secrecy. In Pakistan there are approximately 7,500 people, including children, on death row.\"</p> <p>In some areas with a long tradition of executions, such as central Asia, there is a clear move towards abolition. </p> <p>In Africa, only six countries carried out executions in 2006. In seven states the death penalty is applied for consensual sexual acts between adults of the same sex, while Iran retains the death penalty for a large number of offences, among them \"cursing the Prophet\", adultery and drinking alcohol. Last year, Iran executed 317 people, including eight juveniles.</p>",
  "<h2>Jailed oil tycoon 'sent to solitary confinement'</h2> <p>Jailed oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky has been sent into solitary confinement for 12 days after a written interview with Esquire magazine, his lawyers said yesterday. Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man and founder of the now-dismantled Yukos oil empire, was convicted in 2005 of tax evasion and fraud in what some viewed as an attempt to silence a Kremlin opponent and cement control over the energy sector. A court rejected a parole request in August, citing reasons such as a refusal to take part in a sewing course. The Russian prison service is looking into the report. <br><strong>Associated Press in Moscow</strong></p> <h2>Long-serving leader ahead in vote count</h2> <p>Asia's longest-serving ruler has won the first round in the Maldives' first multiparty presidential poll, but the provisional tally indicated that a runoff vote against a popular human rights activist would be needed. The country's election commission said that President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom had 41% of all votes, with an 85.5% turnout. In second place with 25% was Mohamed Nasheed, a former journalist whom Gayoom had jailed repeatedly. Under the new rules a runoff must be held within 10 days if no one gets 50% of the vote. Gayoom has been a virtual dictator for 30 years.<br><strong>Randeep Ramesh</strong></p> <h2>President calls early poll after bitter rift with PM</h2> <p>Ukraine faced fresh political turmoil yesterday after President Viktor Yushchenko dissolved parliament and ordered an early parliamentary election on December 7. His move follows the collapse of the ruling coalition between his party and the bloc led by Yulia Tymoshenko, the prime minister and the president's former \"orange revolution\" ally. The government fell apart last month when Tymoshenko voted with the opposition Party of the Regions to strip the president of some powers. Yushchenko ordered early elections after the parties failed to agree a new coalition.<br><strong>Luke Harding in Moscow</strong></p> <h2>Fortune-tellers failed to predict the end for MP</h2> <p>A Norwegian MP took voluntary sick leave yesterday, saying that she would not seek re-election after running up huge phone bills at parliament's expense by calling fortune-tellers.

  "<p>Matteo Garrone has created a gruelling species of neo-neorealist Italian cinema from Roberto Saviano's bestselling book Gomorra (or, in English, Gomorrah), about the power and reach of the Neapolitan mob: the camorra. The title's bleak play on words is almost inaudible beneath the film's thundering detonation. After the final credits, it is hard to escape the fear, even the despair, that this whole area - all of Naples, all of southern Italy - is suitable only for a rain of fire from the heavens, or maybe a 1,000-year quarantine, like an ethical or indeed literal Chernobyl.</p> <p>The action takes place mostly in and around the tenement buildings of Scamp\u00eca in Naples; Garrone presents it as a multi-stranded epic of various characters in various stages up the food chain. The mob has been split by a turf war, called a \"secession\", signalled in the film's first minute by a grisly gang hit on some camorristi in a tanning salon: plump, self-admiring, nude wiseguys bathed in an eerie blue light, who are shot dead by a blank-faced crew; the killers impassively deposit their weapons in a sports bag held open for them by a female associate waiting for them in the foyer. Then, and at all other times in the film, no police officers or other authority figures take any sort of effective or preventive action, and the Roman Catholic church is utterly absent. The resulting war divides loyalties, and creates ruptures and fissions that discharge individual stories like jetsam.</p> <p>Marco (Marco Macor) and Piselli (Ciro Petrone) are two brash teenagers, obsessed with Brian de Palma's Scarface and with becoming local bosses themselves: a flukey success stealing cocaine at the very beginning emboldens them to draw attention to themselves with suicidally flashy behaviour. An even younger boy, perhaps 12 or 13, is Tot\u00f2 (Salvatore Abruzzese); he yearns to join the mob, but in the meanwhile earns a few euros picking up shopping for a local woman whose husband appears to be \"away\". Don Ciro (Gianfelice Imparato) is a harassed bean-counter employed by the camorra to patrol the estate's grim walkways and dole out a grotesque sort of maundy-money to its various mendicants and pensioners: widows, the elderly, those who in general need to be kept pacified. Pasquale (Salvatore Cantalupo) is a camorra tailor presiding over vast sweatshops: engine rooms for the fashion industry. He puts himself in mortal danger by giving lucrative \"lessons\" to Chinese competitors, and has an epiphany of pure horror when he watches TV coverage of Scarlett Johansson at the Venice film festival wearing an outfit that seems worryingly familiar.</p> <p>Finally, and most nauseatingly, there is the chilling, semi-legitimate figure of Franco, played by the incomparable Toni Servillo, a businessman who offers dumping grounds for toxic waste, importing carcinogens from all over the EU by falsifying importation documents, disregarding safety procedures and working with camorra families to gain access to the land where the cancer-inducing garbage can be dumped. (He talks about a shadowy \"Zio\" figure who turns out to be a hatchet-faced monster who wants the troublesome Marco and Piselli dealt with.) So the cancer rate thereabouts climbs inexorably upwards, while gangsters get rich and get high and get shot in the head.</p> <p>It is not a mob film in the classical vein, because there is no Scarface or central boss figure with whom we are tacitly allowed to become fascinated. There are just scattered villains and victims, filmed with loose, freewheeling energy and attack. The gloomy, underlit interiors are in contrast to spectacular setpieces in broad daylight, such as an extraordinary wedding procession and most appallingly when Marco and Piselli steal some assault rifles from a camorra weapons dump and, as excited as the children they in fact are, try them out on a deserted stretch of wetland. They have first stripped to their underpants, perhaps because they thought their clothes would become stained. (With cordite? Smoke? Blood?) Their gunfire is ear-splittingly, brain-frazzlingly real, and given how commonplace guns and gunfire are in the movies, it is remarkable how rare this is. Garrone also interestingly conveys what the human face looks like when a gun is fired very close by. There are many scenes when we see the bystander's shock; the face goes into spasm, a microsecond after becoming entirely blank, like that of an animal or a corpse.</p> <p>And beneath all this is the corrupt business of importing waste: literally undermining the entirety of southern Italy with the reckless digging and dumping of poisonous industrial excrement, turning the nation into a gigantic public lavatory, a process facilitated by corruption, by a menacing gangster culture enforcing easy land sales, and by a cynical Italian government. The movie omits that part of Roberto Saviano's book which deals with the camorra's link with Britain. But it certainly leaves us pondering the fact that we British, and all EU members, donate the money and the political respectability which serves to cover up the whole dysfunctional business. Gomorrah is a powerful example of that thrilling current of energy which right now is lighting up Italian cinema.</p>",
  "<p>I'm from Argentina and have just returned from Bolivia and Peru. Rory Carroll (Rampant violence is Latin America's 'worst epidemic', October 9) ignores the main culprits: not criminal gangs, but rightwing governments organised from Washington, which have ruled with impunity.</p> <p>Argentina, like Chile and others, is still recovering from military dictators who disappeared 30,000 people and from the laws which gave them impunity. Most countries have suffered electoral fraud, and the current presidents of both Colombia and Mexico are accused of crimes against humanity.

  "<p>When the man working for Frommer's, America's best-selling travel guide, alighted on the small town of Wasilla in south-central Alaska, he concluded glumly that the place should be condemned as \"the worst kind of suburban sprawl\". To the European eye it would barely be a town at all. Rather, it is a four-lane highway that clatters across the magnificent, mountain-fringed Matanuska-Susitna valley, dumping seven miles of strip-malls, petrol stations and supermarkets in its wake.</p> <p>Wasilla is home to 9,780 people, hundreds of small businesses, a dozen evangelical Christian churches, and a handful of gun stores. The churches are places where many of the faithful see signs that judgment day cannot be far away and where the infallibility of the Bible is rarely, if ever, questioned. The gun stores are places where you can pick up the new Ruger 10/22 carbine, the one that comes in bright pink with a 10-round magazine - \"perfect for your wife or daughter\".</p> <p>Famously, Wasilla is also the home town and launch pad for Sarah Palin, John McCain's vice-presidential running mate. Palin is a woman for whom many Republicans have high hopes, despite performances in early television interviews that were so wobbly they have become YouTube classics. She remains a politician who many in the party would like to believe could be a future president.</p> <p>Her selection six weeks ago saw a slew of stories about the former beauty queen with the brilliant smile and the carefully styled mom-in-a-hurry hairdo, who could drop a caribou at a thousand paces before skinning it, butchering it, and hauling it home for the freezer. In a country that regards the wilderness surrounding Wasilla as a last bastion of rugged, can-do libertarianism, her story seemed to be a potent, 21st-century update on America's central myth.</p> <p>But Wasilla is no frontier town. A third of the town's workforce commute to office jobs in Anchorage, 45 miles to the south. Many others work in the endless strip malls. Palin may shoot, fish and ride a snowmobile, but her neighbours are more accustomed to seeing her leap into the 4x4 to drive to the local Starbucks. Palin's home town represents, at most, the call of the semi-wild.</p> <p>So if the image of McCain's running mate as a tough outdoorswoman is part truth and partly a confection of her party's machine, what are we to make of the rest of the package?</p> <p>What will be revealed about her later today with the conclusion of the investigation into the so-called Troopergate affair, in which she is alleged to have abused her power as state governor by sacking the head of the Alaskan state police after he refused to become involved in a family feud?</p> <p>Is Palin truly a warrior of the religious right, a woman who advocates the teaching of creationism and who is opposed to abortion, even for victims of rape and incest? Would she, as opponents claim, seek to ban books from library shelves?</p> <p>Who, in short, is Sarah Palin? And what on earth does she want?</p> <p>Palin was born in February 1964 in another small town, Sandpoint, Idaho, the third of four children of Chuck and Sally Heath. Genealogists have traced her father's family tree as a far as John Lothropp, a nonconformist minister from Beverley in Yorkshire, who settled in Massachusetts in 1634 to escape persecution. If so, this would make Palin a distant relation of George Bush.</p> <p><strong>Headstrong girl</strong></p> <p>The family moved to Alaska when Sarah was two months old after Chuck, a primary school teacher, took up a post there. Accounts of her time at Wasilla high school suggest a headstrong, slightly pushy, but popular pupil: a girl who was determined to succeed on the sports field, and who wanted to be noticed, who liked to be liked.</p> <p>Her university days appear to have been considerably less happy. In five years she flitted between as many different colleges, in Hawaii, Idaho and Alaska, sometimes quitting after one term. It is unclear why she was so unsettled. It is clear, however, that she was far from the centre of attention at this time: after McCain named Palin as his running mate, the Idaho Statesman newspaper tracked down 30 of her former teachers and classmates at two colleges in the state. Only four could remember who she was.</p> <p>Returning to Wasilla in 1987 she worked as a sports reporter with her local newspaper, the Mat-Su Valley Frontiersman, and as a correspondent for an Alaskan television station. She showed little interest in forging a lengthy career in journalism, instead marrying her high school sweetheart, Todd Palin, a part Yup'ik Native Alaskan who works as a technician with British Petroleum on the state's North Slope oilfield. In 1989 the first of the couple's children was born and, in keeping with the Alaskan fashion for unusual names, the boy was named Track, because he arrived during the athletics season.</p> <p>Since parading her five children, including Bristol, 17, who is pregnant, and Trig, a six-month-old boy with Down's syndrome, at the Republican national convention last month, Palin has been the subject of bizarre internet rumours about her children's parentage, and reports in the supermarket tabloids alleging an extramarital affair, which her team dismissed as a \"vicious lie\". In Wasilla, people who know the couple say their marriage appears genuinely to be strong.</p> <p>During the early 90s, when Palin was raising her children, Wasilla and the other small towns in the valley were undergoing rapid change as they sucked in immigrants from that place known to Alaskans as \"Outside\" - the rest of the US. And in common with other communities in the US, the valley towns were riven by tension between secular liberals on one hand and Christian traditionalists on the other, people who had little interest in - and no hope of - reconciling their fundamental disagreements over abortion, gay rights, gun control and censorship. </p> <p>In Palmer, for instance, a town 20 minutes drive north-east of Wasilla, there was a struggle for control of the hospital, one of the few in Alaska where second trimester abortions were carried out. There were demonstrations and court battles, and rumours that one gynaecologist had taken to wearing a bulletproof vest beneath her jacket.</p> <p>In Wasilla, the curator of the town's tiny museum, John Cooper, says he received threats from people from a local evangelical church. \"They simply wanted to let me know that my political views, as a liberal, as a progressive, were not welcome,\" he says.</p> <p>This was the conflict into which Palin waded when she decided to stand for election as mayor of Wasilla. </p> <p>Palin had been a junior member of the town's council for four years, and in 1996 decided to run against the popular mayor, John Stein. Perhaps unusually for such a small-town affair, she won an endorsement from the National Rifle Association and attracted the support of a nationwide anti-abortion organisation that leafleted the town's voters. </p> <p>In Palmer, the Rev Howard Bess, a left-leaning Baptist minister, is convinced Palin was the candidate of a network of evangelist pastors that met regularly in the valley in a conclave calling itself the Ministers' Prayer Group. \"Palin first came on the political scene in the context of this conflict focused on the abortion issue,\" says Bess. \"You can't understand her without understanding the culture wars that took place in the Mat-Su Valley in the 90s.\"</p> <p>Laura Chase, who managed Palin's campaign, recalls her not as doctrinaire but as seriously ambitious. \"We were sitting at my kitchen table at about 11 o'clock one night, talking about term times, and she said: 'If I haven't moved on to higher things after two terms, I don't deserve to be in politics.' I said: 'Sarah, you'll be governor in 10 years.' And she said: 'I don't want to be governor, I want to be president.' I glanced up and she was looking down at a piece of paper, she was on to the next thing we were doing. I just chalked it up to the adrenaline of the campaign.\"</p> <p>Today, people who loathe all that Palin says she stands for cannot help admire her common touch. Bill Clinton says: \"I come from Arkansas. I get why she's hot out there, why she's doing well.\" Even in 1996, Palin seemed to float along on a tide of likability. The way she looked, the way she sounded, the way she moved - it all combined to make people feel they knew her in some way, and that they should vote for her. \"She was a rock star, no doubt about it,\" says Stein.</p> <p>Nobody in Wasilla believes that Palin's parents, by all accounts reserved people, coached such polished performances. Rather, Stein and others point to the confidence that came with high school sporting success, her brief time as a TV reporter, and the opportunities she had to speak up at church.</p> <p>Chase sees something else. \"She's really pretty insecure. I was with her before she gave a speech to the people from BP in Anchorage when she was running for governor, and she was terrified. There are real fears there. But every time she goes out and persuades people to like her, it lifts her, it makes her feel better about herself.</p> <p>\"She draws on something inside herself to make them like her. She's a natural actress. And then she wants to do it again, with even more people. She's a brilliant politician, but it's all about getting more and more people to love her.\"</p> <p>With her charismatic appeal and the backing of many of the town's evangelicals, Palin triumphed in the mayoral contest, winning by 616 votes to 413. Stein, a Lutheran, recalls a local radio station reporting that the town finally had a Christian mayor.</p> <p>In office, Palin did not push the conservative social agenda at the heart of her election campaign. She couldn't: she was running an authority little bigger than an English parish council - albeit one with a $6m budget - and her main responsibilities were for planning applications, road maintenance, and the town's 13-strong police force.</p> <p><strong>Confrontational style</strong></p> <p>Her critics in Wasilla say she made the job appear more difficult than it was because of her confrontational style of management. She sacked the police chief, other senior staff resigned, and Cooper was made redundant. \"One of her conservative supporters came up to me in the street and said: 'Gotcha Cooper!'\"</p> <p>The town's librarian, Mary Ellen Emmons, was fired after standing up to Palin during a conversation about censorship. She was reinstated shortly afterwards, amid a public outcry, and the McCain team now insists that the conversation had been \"rhetorical\". But Chase says she recalls Palin telling the librarian that she objected to a children's book about gay parents called Daddy's Roommate. \"I brought a copy to the next council meeting and offered it to Sarah to read. She said: 'I don't need to read that kind of stuff.'\"</p> <p>The Frontiersman was excoriating. </p> <p>An editorial accused the mayor of confusing her 616 votes with a \"coronation\", adding: \"Palin promised to change the status quo, but at every turn we find hints of cronyism and political manoeuvring.\"</p> <p>A public meeting was held in the town's theatre, with some urging a recall, a form of impeachment, to remove her from office. Palin learned her lesson fast, lowering her profile and leaving day-to-day administration to the council's senior civil servant. \"I grew tremendously in my early months as mayor,\" was how she later described that time.</p> <p>When Palin was 12 she was born again, and was baptised in the frigid waters of one of the half-dozen lakes around Wasilla. From that day, and throughout her time as mayor, she and her mother worshipped at the Assembly of God, a Pentecostal church where some members of the congregation speak in tongues, and where the current pastor is on record as saying he believes that the end of the world is nigh.</p> <p>While Palin has since moved to another evangelical church - reportedly telling friends it is \"less extreme\" - Pentecostalism undoubtedly helped forge her views. She says she believes creationism should be taught alongside evolution, and says abortion is an \"atrocity\" that should be permitted only when the life of the mother is at stake.</p> <p>When she made her next step in Alaskan politics, however, she made no attempt to turn these views into policy. Nor, to the displeasure of local Republicans, did she make much effort to uphold traditional party values. Instead, by the time Palin ran for governor in 2006, she had remoulded herself as a campaigner against sleaze and corruption.</p> <p>It was a good moment to be a moral crusader. For two years the FBI had been raiding the homes and offices of prominent Alaskan Republicans, investigating their links with oil companies. Five politicians were eventually charged with bribery and corruption.</p> <p>The incumbent Republican governor, Frank Murkowski, was wildly unpopular - largely because of his cosy relationship with Big Oil - and Palin had established her ethical credentials by resigning from the state's Oil and Gas Conservation Commission in protest at what she described as the corruption of fellow Republicans.</p> <p>Turning on their TVs during the election, many Alaskans saw Palin's folksy, nose-wrinkling, you-betcha style for the first time, and they liked what they saw. They liked that she was fresh and she was feisty and that she really did seem to offer change. Disillusioned Republicans were relieved to see someone - anyone - doing battle with the party's leathery old guard. Polls showed that even university-educated, liberal women warmed to her. Palin was swept effortlessly into office, capturing 48% of the vote in a three-way race.</p> <p>She surrounded herself with a group of aides whose loyalty was beyond question. Soon they came to describe themselves as Palinistas. According to a number of sources, one of her aides, who is on the state payroll, has been working as a full-time babysitter for Trig in recent months. Todd Palin also appears to play a role in the government of the state. Although unelected, and not holding any salaried office, he is known to take part in a number of meetings.</p> <p>The new governor enjoyed approval ratings of more than 80% in the months after her election. But it was not long before a slightly puzzled electorate began wondering who it was that they had elected and what it was that she really believed.</p> <p>Forging alliances with Democrats, Palin pursued a shamelessly populist agenda, imposing a windfall tax on oil companies. Leftwing Democrats hailed the Palinistas as \"Alaskan redneck socialists\", while Republicans muttered that their governor was \"imposing British levels of taxation\". After she used a chunk of the revenue to send a $1,200 cheque to each man, woman and child in the state, her opponents knew protest was pointless.</p> <p><strong>'Disappointingly liberal'</strong></p> <p>She dismayed many on the religious right by blocking a bill that would have denied benefits to same-sex partners of state employees, maintaining she had no choice because it was unconstitutional. She also resisted Republican attempts to force abortion restriction measures on to the legislative agenda, apparently because she did not wish to alienate her new Democrat allies. Lyda Green, Republican president of the state senate, speaks for many in the party in Alaska when she says Palin has been \"disappointingly liberal\" since she was elected governor.</p> <p>Others, who had hoped to see Palin translate her high approval rating into legislation aimed at tackling Alaska's perennial problems of alcohol abuse and underperforming schools, were exasperated by how little she wanted to do.</p> <p>Larry Persily, a senior civil servant who has worked for three Alaskan governors and is a former associate director of Palin's office in Washington, says: \"She was just not interested. She had no interest in public policy beyond the populist drive to raise oil taxes and push through ethics reforms that the Democrats had already drafted.\"</p> <p>Rebecca Braun, editor of Alaska Budget Report, a non-aligned political newsletter, adds: \"If she hasn't pushed the teaching of creationism in schools, it's because she hasn't pushed the teaching of anything in schools. She hasn't promoted her rightwing views because she hasn't promoted any views at all. She really hasn't done very much.\"</p> <p>But if Palin's approval ratings were falling by last summer, her sincerity as a social conservative being questioned, her Republican credentials under attack, and her commitment to reform belied by a track record of inertia, she could always point to her impeccable ethical standards.</p> <p>And then came Troopergate.</p> <p>Palin stands accused of sacking the head of the state's police force, Walt Monegan, when he refused to dismiss her former brother-in-law, a state trooper who had been through a bitter divorce and child custody battle with her younger sister. There is evidence suggesting some members of her family waged a vendetta against the trooper, Mike Wooten, making complaints that he had broken the law, committed disciplinary offences, and lied to obtain sickness benefits. Eventually a divorce court judge warned family members to leave the man alone.</p> <p>Wooten was investigated and disciplined in March 2006, but when Palin was elected governor later that year, she and her husband, and members of her staff, are said to have pressed to have the case reopened. When Monegan was sacked last July, he claimed that his refusal to fire Wooten had cost him his job, an allegation Palin denies.</p> <p>An investigation into Troopergate was ordered by the state's legislature, and a report on the matter is due to be published today. While Palin initially agreed to cooperate, her husband and several members of her staff resisted giving evidence, despite being summonsed. It has also emerged that Palin and her senior aides used personal email accounts while conducting official business in order to conceal their communications about Wooten.</p> <p>Many Alaskans have been greatly disappointed by Palin's behaviour during the Troopergate affair. Patrick Dougherty, editor of the Anchorage Daily News, the state's main newspaper, says the episode has \"raised serious doubts about her honesty and integrity\".</p> <p>By late August, Palin's approval ratings were still high in Alaska, but there were growing doubts about her ability and sincerity, and there was an investigation hanging over her head. And at this point, no doubt looking at her public performances and her star quality, McCain and his team decided she was the ideal running mate.</p> <p>Dougherty says his reaction was one of disbelief when he heard. \"She was clearly unqualified.\" </p> <p>Lyda Green was equally astonished. \"I'm a loyal Republican and I want to see the Republican party do well and do the right thing. But before she was selected, no one came to Alaska and asked the questions you're asking now. And that, to me, is insufficient.\"</p> <p>If McCain had sent people to Alaska with instructions to ask who Palin really is, to find out what substance lay behind the style, how successful might they have been?</p> <p>Asked what drives his former boss, Persily confesses he cannot be sure. \"She likes being in the limelight, being the centre of attention. What she really craves is popularity, she wants the warmth and love of the public.\" Laura Chase says Palin has an uncanny ability to be all things to all people. \"She can walk up to people and quickly have a perception of what they want her to be, and she will instantly be that person.\"</p> <p>Persily and Chase, who do not know each other, use the same word to describe Palin: chameleon. Both also use similar language to explain how much she unnerves them.</p> <p>Chase says: \"I admire her, she has boundless energy and great determination. But the idea that she could be the leader of the free world scares the hell out of me.\"</p> <p>Persily believes Palin is \"immature, inexperienced, and has poor judgment\", but acknowledges that she could still become president. \"And that,\" he says, \"should scare the hell out of everybody.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday October 11 2008. The Alaska public safety commissioner fired by Sarah Palin last year is Walter Monegan, not Irl Stambaugh as we said in early editions of the paper. Stambaugh was the police chief of Wasilla who was fired by Palin in 1997. The error was introduced during the editing process</p>",
  "<p>Half of state schools in England are in breach of new rules on admissions, according to the chief adjudicator, Sir Philip Hunter.</p> <p>His dramatic revelation of \"widespread\" failure by school authorities to fully implement rules to make the system fairer follows a major inquiry. </p> <p>Schools have not removed discriminatory questions about parents' marital and employment status from application forms and needed to make clearer definitions in admissions rules, he said. Faith schools were more likely to break rules.</p> <p>Hunter insisted that the vast majority of the problems were not intentional on the schools' part and that they are being rectified. But he confirmed that some children would have been unfairly awarded places at their chosen school and others denied one this year as a result.</p> <p>The national inquiry will report on compliance with the new code to ministers next month. It follows a small-scale study of three authorities, ordered by the education secretary, Ed Balls, which found schools breaking the laws - most controversially in Barnet where parents were being asked for financial contributions. Parents of around 1.2m children are considering where to apply for next year. </p> <p>Hunter revealed interim findings at a conference of admissions officers in London yesterday. He told the Guardian: \"The secretary of state was quite right in saying we have a problem. It's not wilful disregard of the law, but administrative confusion. It is widespread.\" Asked how widespread, he said: \"About half of them.\"</p> <p>His review saw about 3,750 admissions faith and foundation schools submitting reports on their admission rules to barristers who vetted them against the new code. Every local authority also submitted reports covering all the 21,000 community schools they coordinate admissions for. </p> <p>Half of authorities contravened the rules brought in last year to prevent selection by the back door. The rules prevent schools asking questions about parental status or conducting interviews. </p> <p>Problems were more extensive in faith schools compared with local-authority-run schools, Hunter confirmed. The major problems included supplementary forms asking about parents' jobs or marital status. Schools failed to properly define their rules - some schools automatically allowed step-siblings a place at a school while others said only biological siblings were allowed. Many schools were not giving children in care priority over others. </p> <p>Hunter said he has written to authorities with barrister reports asking them to challenge criticisms or report back on changes they are making within a month.</p>",
  "<p>Finding a buyer for Newcastle United could prove impossible in the current financial crisis, the man charged with selling the club admitted yesterday.</p> <p>Keith Harris, vice-chairman of the investment bank Seymour Pierce, said that the club's owner, Mike Ashley, could remain in control for much longer than anticipated, as a serious bidder has yet to emerge and the global meltdown of financial markets made it \"easy for people to find an excuse\" not to buy. Harris said that although several parties had shown an interest since Ashley asked him to help sell Newcastle last month, none had come up with a viable bid.</p> <p>Harris was speaking as Newcastle came to terms with yesterday's departure of Tony Jimenez, their vice-president in charge of recruitment and a key ally of Ashley and Dennis Wise. A Newcastle spokesman said Jimenez's departure would have no bearing on the future of Wise, the executive director (football), who has been the target of fans' resentment since the departure of the manager Kevin Keegan in September.</p> <p>Ashley - whose company Sports Direct is now worth \u00a3168m compared to \u00a31.7bn in February because of the stockmarket crash - has placed a price of \u00a3300m on the club, a figure few are willing to meet in the current climate. \"Mike did it [took over the club] for the right reasons and it hasn't worked out,\" said Harris. \"It is a major iconic brand and we are attracting interest, but this is a very easy climate for people to find an excuse. Newcastle has been transformed as a football club, they are a big club and I can see them going somewhere, but it requires time and careful attention.\" When asked if Ashley would stay on as owner because of a lack of acceptable bids, Harris replied: \"I wouldn't rule anything out.\" </p> <p>Harris, who believes the credit crunch will have a profound effect on the Premier League, defended Ashley's record, claiming he had wiped out the club's debt and invested heavily to improve the academy. \"He has done a lot of good there with the academy, there has been a lot of investment. When you look back through the years so many good players have come from that north-east corner, but how many were signed up by Newcastle? Not many.\"</p> <p>Magpies fans had hoped to see the back of Ashley long before the opening of the transfer window in January, with many still hankering after the return of Keegan. News of Jimenez's departure briefly raised the possibility that, if there was no takeover imminent, there could be a major reshuffle, which might tempt Keegan back. However, with Wise and the managing director, Derek Llambias, still employed, that looks unlikely. </p> <p>\"People should not fall into the mistake of believing that the departure of Jimenez is going to lead to the return of Kevin Keegan,\" said a club source. Jimenez, who wants to stay in football, is understood to have quit as a result of the uncertainty over the club's future ownership. Ashley has also indicated he will not fund the purchase of any new players in January if he is still in charge, effectively making Jimenez's recruitment job redundant.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Newcastle's Australian striker, Mark Viduka, is expected to be out for another six months as he needs an operation to solve a long-standing Achilles injury. The interim manager, Joe Kinnear, said: \"We know there is a chance Viduka may need surgery and if this turns out to be the case we will be without his services for a minimum of six months. This is not good news.\"</p>",
  "<p>This global economic crisis is affecting everything - even television. And nowhere is this more evident than in <strong>Natural Born Sellers</strong> (ITV1). It's basically The Apprentice for the credit crunch. No flash house in Notting Hill for these contestants; they're staying at the Holiday Inn, right by the M1, outside Wakefield (twin room: \u00a368). Their boardroom is the Holiday Inn conference room, which has a carpet designed in hell, by Satan himself. And their Sir Alan is John Caudwell. Who? That's what I'm saying, he's just some bloke who made a few quid selling mobile phones. OK, a few billion quid selling mobile phones, but admit it, you've never heard of him. And he's not even a Sir.</p> <p>There's nothing very glamorous about the tasks, either. In this one, they're selling double-glazing for West Yorkshire Windows, a family-run Wakefield business: 4% commission, with a target of 15 grand each for the week. </p> <p>You know what, though? It really doesn't matter. Because it is still weirdly mesmeric television. There are two reasons for this, I think. The first is the selling process itself, an extraordinary game of psychology and mind control that is absolutely fascinating, especially to those of us who don't - and couldn't - do it ourselves. And second, the people who make this show have realised - as the makers of the Apprentice did - that the way to guarantee success is to find the vilest, back-stabbingest, most amoral monsters in the country to take part. </p> <p>Like Danny, currently top dog, and a foul-mouthed sexist pig. \"She's evil, that fucking woman,\" he says of fellow contestant Thea. \"Fucking evil, the root of all evil.\" Danny says he'd rather douse himself in petrol and set fire to himself than get beaten by Thea. </p> <p>I think he means it, too - though to be fair to Danny, I think he may be right about Thea. \"I'm not just any woman,\" she says. \"I wear my balls on my chest, and they're much bigger than theirs, believe me.\"</p> <p>Then there's Gavin, who does his \"not the band\" joke every time he mentions the doors, which is a lot when that's what he's selling. And Scott, who learned from The Apprentice's Lee (\"that's what I'm talking about\") McQueen that a catchphrase is what you need to get on in this type of show. \"Check your bad self out bruvva,\" he says, after every single utterance. Almost. Imagine what <br>it would be like living with him. Or with any of them. Not only would it drive you mad, but you'd have to buy a big lock and chain for everything - even your own soul - in case they tried to sell it behind your back.</p> <p>Where do they find these people? They were all designed in hell, by Satan himself. But they make wonderful telly. Who said recession couldn't be fun?</p> <p>If you're ever invited to address a conference of narcoleptics, then my advice would be to politely decline, especially if you have any self-confidence issues or doubts about your ability as a public speaker. Look at this poor man at the Narcolepsy Network event in <strong>Ninety Naps a Day</strong> (Channel 4). He's a world expert, he's standing up there saying some really interesting stuff, and he looks down at his audience and they're all yawning, and nodding off, and lying down on the floor to go to sleep. Of course that's the nature of the condition, but it can't be much of a confidence boost. </p> <p>We're following three British narcoleptics to this conference in Albany, New York. Some of the things they do over there - the hugging, the laughing workshops, actually being open about their feelings - are a bit too much for our poor bottled-up Brits. But at least they're meeting other narcoleptics, for the first time in their lives. And for Christine, whose husband is one, she finally realises for the first time in 40 years that he hasn't been making it up. I don't know what she thought was going on - Ken even fell asleep on their first date in 1968; maybe she just thought she was being boring. </p> <p>I would have liked a little more science: something about what is actually going on inside these people to make them fall asleep the whole time. Maybe not enough is known, but it's more likely the programme-makers thought the science would send us to sleep. It was a still a moving film, though. </p> <p>The worst thing for narcoleptics (well, the second worst thing; the worst, obviously, being that they have this terrible debilitating condition that ruins their lives) must be that for everyone else it's quite funny. How annoying must that be.</p>",
  "<p>Michael O'Leary steeled us for the worst earlier this year when he said Europe needed a \"good, deep, bloody recession\". This week it became clear that the Ryanair chief executive is getting what he wished for. And more.</p> <p>Admitting that he might have, for once, undercooked his comments, he says: \"We might be talking about a depression. I would be very bearish for the next four or five years.\" O'Leary is talking hours after another scenery-chewing press conference. Not so much answering questions as working the room like a stand-up, he covered a range of subjects from global warming to journalists' luxury travel habits with a characteristic mix of sharp insight and expletives. Away from a larger audience, the quick mind is still at work but the presentation is toned down - an admission that the performance is an extension of Ryanair's garish advertising campaigns.</p> <p>\"If you can generate PR and controversy, it means more seat sales for Ryanair and that's mission accomplished,\" says the 47-year-old Irishman. Outside his one-man press circus, however, he is closer to the sombre mood enveloping the airline industry. About 30 carriers have gone bust this year, grounded by high fuel costs, and that number will rise as a global downturn turns the screw by reducing passenger numbers. Ryanair still plays the underdog but it is a major player in European aviation now and the more sceptical analysts are concerned that many of the airline's 49 million passengers last year were discretionary travellers who will disappear at the first whiff of recession.</p> <p>Asked how many Ryanair passengers are spur-of-the-moment purchasers, he guesses: \"We don't know. Between 20% and 40% is discretionary. There is no doubt that some of that traffic will not travel now.\" For an airline expecting to carry 58 million people in this financial year, that is a lot of customers. But if O'Leary is gloomy about a portion of his sales, he is scathing about his rivals' prospects. He is confident that cost-conscious customers lured by Ryanair's lower fares will make up the difference. \"Whatever the number of that traffic is, it will be more than made up by people who are deciding not to use Aer Lingus, easyJet or British Airways short haul. The price disparity is getting wider.\" He says Ryanair has \"pretty much filled\" all its flights this month and for much of November by snatching customers off competitors through seat sales.</p> <p>O'Leary's confidence is born of Ryanair's history. It has gone from a small carrier operating one plane out of Waterford airport 23 years ago to the world's largest in terms of international flights. Last year it reported profits of \u20ac439m (\u00a3345m). That is a considerable achievement in a global industry that barely recorded a positive profit margin over the same period, despite strong sales and relatively low fuel costs. </p> <p><strong>Optimistic</strong></p> <p>Nonetheless, those benign market conditions will not return to Europe for some time, according to even the most optimistic predictions, and O'Leary does not claim that Ryanair will be immune. The interview takes place in a hotel next to London's Victoria station, the rail gateway for Ryanair passengers travelling to Gatwick airport. Under his prognosis, fewer airline customers will be passing through in the next few years.</p> <p>\"The downside is that traffic will be down industry-wide. The upside is that the oil price will fall, the dollar will be weak and we have to try to trade our way through that.\" O'Leary is a disciple of Herb Kelleher, the founder of no-frills air travel and former chief executive of Dallas's Southwest Airlines, who ran his airline on four principles: fly one type of plane to cut engineering costs; keep overheads down; turn around aircraft quickly, and abandon air miles schemes. Ryanair under O'Leary has modernised those basics and created a lean business that, up to now, has grown inexorably.</p> <p>\"Five years ago we were half the size of BA. Now we're nearly twice the size of BA [in terms of passenger numbers].\"</p> <p>The basic strategy will not change in the downturn, he says, as the airline aims to double traffic and profits by 2012. Ryanair keeps its 166 planes in the air for as long as possible and packs the jets with passengers who might not pay much for their tickets but bolster profits by paying for add-ons such as baggage check-in, food and hotel hire. Overheads are kept low by buying fuel-efficient aircraft in bulk with aggressive discounts, cutting baggage-handling costs by restricting luggage through hefty check-in charges and flying to lesser-known airports that have cheaper landing fees. Once those tenets are in place and if oil stays below $100 (\u00a358) a barrel, Ryanair ensures it meets its target of filling 85% of seats per flight - the level at which it makes a profit - by selling tickets at aggressively low prices.</p> <p>Now that the hard work is done, after 14 years in charge, why not hand control to someone else? O'Leary's departure date is like a rolling contract. He always tells journalists that he is one or two years away from standing down and then, when the two years pass, he renews the pledge. This week, he doubled the estimate. \"The next couple of years will just get more interesting,\" he says. \"I plan to go in the next three to four years.\" </p> <p>He expects to have \"sorted out\" three issues by then: an ongoing dispute with Dublin airport; the future of Stansted airport, and Ryanair's planned acquisition of Aer Lingus. After that, he says, he might set up a long-haul airline. However, as Ryanair's fifth largest shareholder, he has considerable influence over his departure date and, when he goes, can spend his multimillion-euro fortune.</p> <p>O'Leary's achievements are widely respected within the industry, but some executives are irritated by his scattergun approach with the press. When he has warned of an industry slump in the past, shares in easyJet have dropped too, even if Ryanair's arch-competitor is seeing no downturn at all. Toby Nicol, easyJet's longest-serving director, says: \"He is widely known within the industry as Michael O'Really.\"</p> <p>O'Leary is unapologetic and has some tips for other airline bosses. \"Richard Branson will bore you to tears at a press conference. For all the PR, he is not the most entertaining man in the world. Apart from doing a photo-op with girls with big boobs, he is not that exciting.\" Doesn't he get embarrassed about donning a Spanish Flamenco costume and straddling a model Ryanair jet, as he did for a photocall in Madrid last month?</p> <p>\"I don't give a shite. You are just getting hung up on your ego. If it generates publicity and sells seats, then that's what you are paid to do.\" According to Ryanair's September passenger numbers, up 20% year-on-year, it is still working.

  "<p>Gordon Brown last night branded Iceland's failure to guarantee British savings in its failed banks as \"totally unacceptable and illegal\", amid warnings that more than 100 local councils, police authorities and fire services have up to \u00a31bn lost in its bankrupted system.</p> <p>Charities, including children's hospices, warned they were at risk of losing \u00a325m. </p> <p>In unusually aggressive terms, the prime minister said he was willing to use anti-terrorism legislation to freeze the assets of other Icelandic companies operating in Britain in an effort to recoup the lost money. The extent of the potential difficulties for councils and other bodies began to emerge yesterday as more and more said they had invested money in Iceland's high-yielding savers' accounts. </p> <p>By yesterday evening, the Local Government Association (LGA) had accumulated reports showing that 108 councils in England, Scotland and Wales had deposited \u00a3798.95m in Icelandic banks.</p> <p>With no sign of Iceland being able to repay the money and councils lobbying ministers for reassurance that the cash would be recovered, Britain went on the offensive. \"What happened in Iceland is completely unacceptable,\" said Brown. \"I've spoken to the Icelandic prime minister, I have told him this is effectively an illegal action that they have taken. We are freezing the assets of Icelandic companies in the UK where we can. We will take further action against the Icelandic authorities where necessary to recover the money.</p> <p>\"The responsibility for this lies fairly and squarely with the Icelandic authorities, and they cannot simply default. The Icelandic authorities are responsible for this, and we are demanding the money is paid back to the local authorities, and we are prepared to consider all forms of action, including, as we did, attempting to freeze assets.\" </p> <p>Geir Haarde, Iceland's prime minister, said he was surprised by Brown's remarks, and urged him to consider resolving the issue in the courts. The Treasury said it had no imminent plan for a wider move against Icelandic companies operating in the UK saying the only action taken so far was the freezing of the Landsbanki's estimated \u00a37bn of UK assets.</p> <p>The British government invoked the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001 to freeze the British assets of Landsbanki, something for which Brown refused to apologise, saying he had a responsibility to recover the assets in the most effective way possible.</p> <p>Referring to the move, Haarde said: \"I told the chancellor that we consider this to be a completely unfriendly act.\"</p> <p>Asked if the financial crisis engulfing Iceland had become a diplomatic crisis with Britain, Haarde added: \"I thought so for a few minutes this morning when I realised that a terrorist law was being applied against us. That was not very pleasant. I'm afraid not many governments would have taken that very kindly, to be put into that category.\"</p> <p>Haarde said Iceland had not decided on whether to seek help from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and negotiations to secure a \u20ac4bn (\u00a33.2bn) loan from Russia would not begin until Tuesday.</p> <p>Under Iceland's financial regulations, the government is supposed to pay up to \u00a316,000 compensation per frozen account at a total cost of \u00a32.2bn. </p> <p>Britain is angry since it has received no assurances from the Icelandic government that they would meet this commitment. It is estimated that British investors have a total of \u00a38bn deposited in the Icelandic banks, including \u00a34.6bn in the Icesaver internet bank. </p> <p>The Treasury said it was sending a team to Iceland today after failing to get satisfactory answers from the authorities there for at least three days. </p> <p>In an effort to work out the scale of the potential exposure of public bodies to the Icelandic banking collapse, leaders of local councils met with John Healey, the local government minister, yesterday. </p> <p>At the meeting in London yesterday afternoon the councils tried to persuade the government to guarantee their savings, in the same way that ministers had guaranteed the savings for individual investors in Landsbanki. But Healey refused to give any such commitment after the meeting. Instead he said the government \"will not leave councils under pressure on their own\". He conceded that the councils had not acted recklessly, and had been following Whitehall advice sent out in 2004 to spread their investments across a wide range of banks.</p> <p>Local councils pointed out that they had been given legal advice that the Icelandic banks had three star credit ratings, and there was no way of predicting this collapse was imminent. \"The local councils are well informed investors. This is not money that is lost, it may be money that is at risk,\" a statement said.</p> <p>After the meeting , the LGA said \"a small number\" of authorities faced specific short term problems. </p> <p>In a joint statement, the LGA and the government said: \"For those local authorities who are facing severe short-term difficulties government and the LGA will agree an appropriate set of ways to assist. We will judge what's appropriate on a case by case basis.\" Authorities with big investments include Kent county council with \u00a350m; Nottingham city council, \u00a342m; Norfolk county council, \u00a332.5m; Dorset county council, and Hertfordshire county council, both \u00a328m.</p> <p>Fifteen police forces also have investments in Iceland, as does Transport for London which revealed it had a \u00a340m deposit with Kaupthing Singer &amp; Friedlander, a UK subsidiary of the bankrupt Kaupthing bank. </p> <p>TfL, which runs the London's bus and tube services, said it did not know if it would get the money back. But a spokesman said TfL's \u00a37bn budget was big enough to absorb the loss.</p> <p>Stephen Bubb, chief executive of Acevo, the representative body for charity chief executives, urged the chancellor to guarantee the bank deposits of UK charities. He said the collapse of Icelandic banks had hit charities hard with some losing up to one fifth of their reserves, in sums ranging up to \u00a312m. The total losses reported to Acevo added up to more than \u00a325m. It also emerged yesterday that the 300,000 UK personal savers who had accounts with Icesave would be lucky to get their money back by Christmas.</p>",
  "<p>There are going to be some unlikely alliances struck before this credit crunch is over. Iceland has already gone begging to Russia for a few kr\u00f3na. Who knows what strange deals will bubble to the surface next? In Britain, we are increasingly worried about funding for the Olympics, particularly after warnings from the Delivery Authority that the \u00a31bn athletes' village may have to be nationalised. So let us properly consider the multibillion-pound loan offer the government has received from \"senior\" well-heeled figures in the Sharia banking community. A sharia loan would, according to Koranic law, charge no interest. Seems just the thing. The Department of Culture and the ODA confirms that the offer has been received and is being mulled over, but we can tell you that the concept has made the BNP very, very angry. There must be a downside.</p> <p>\u2022 Yes, many are hurting from the financial tsunami, but we know that in this, as in many appalling disasters, those of wit and fortitude will survive. Website The Lawyer reports that, following his return to the private sector, a growing proportion of the good Lord Goldsmith's work at present \"is emanating from the continuing chaos\" in the United States. \"The first few months of the credit crunch did not result in widespread litigation,\" he tells them. \"This is different. People are losing real money, not just seeing their share prices fall.\" He says a variety of parties such as vulture funds and shareholder action groups are already circling, looking to recoup investments through the courts. \"And they'll look to those with deep pockets.\" And they'll look to their lawyers.</p> <p>\u2022 PR people are having a good crisis too, and it is through them that we are able to bring you revealing dispatches from the front line of this war on recession. The first tells us that financial types close to the Bank of England have responded by eating more comfort food: bangers and mash, game pie, that sort of thing. That is from a restaurant close to the Bank. The second suggests that a third of all women and a quarter of men feel their savings would be safer under a mattress than in a bank or building society. This from the Sleep Council. Financed by the Bed Federation. You see. Everyone's doing their bit.</p> <p>\u2022 And that includes Gordon, for he was up at 4am on Wednesday, the day he put the UK's housekeeping money on the blackjack table. At 10pm that evening, he was still up and at the Foreign Office; cracking jokes at the launch of a study ranking Britain's 100 most influential black people - the Power List. \"The first time I figured on a list, I rang one of my friends and said there I am - I am number four,\" he told them. \"Neil Kinnock is number 12, and John Smith is 25. But I looked again and saw Douglas Alexander at the top, and my friend pointed out that it was alphabetical.\" Still, he's been number one this week.</p> <p>\u2022 The magic bullet is information, and there is plenty of it, courtesy of the estimable Jeff Randall, on Telegraph TV. But one wonders what the Barclay brothers think of their foray into film when they note that the most frequently requested videos there include two about an Indonesian man whose warts have grown root-like and a BBC April Fool about flying penguins. It could be the Barclays watching them. It can get dull on Sark.</p> <p>\u2022 And finally, we have mail from Tom Wise, the MEP, whose talent for film criticism we referred to yesterday. \"I wasted 105 minutes of my life watching impenetrable gibberish; the foetid ramblings of a perverted mind,\" he said, having viewed one entry to the Lux prize for cinema. Angry he is, Jonathan Ross he ain't. He is currently on police bail facing fraud allegations, and we suggested that his cinema trip might have been a distraction. But he says: \"Part of the tasks I am asked to do as an MEP is vote for one of three films. I can only do that with any conscience if I have actually seen the films.\" Only 55 of 785 MEPs bothered last year, apparently. One ordeal down, two to go. This weekend, think of him.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:diary@theguardian.com\">diary@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Cheap cigarettes and other tobacco products smuggled into Britain cause 4,000 or so premature deaths a year, four times the number of fatalities occurring through illegal drugs, doctors claim.</p> <p>High tobacco prices are drive a flourishing black market for contraband tobacco in Britain, with more than one in five cigarettes known to be smuggled goods.</p> <p>A study led by Robert West, a professor at the Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre in London, found that if smuggling were stopped tobacco prices would rise by about 12%. </p> <p>Writing in the British Medical Journal, West and his colleagues estimate that such a price increase would encourage between 5%-8% of smokers to stop smoking, and the outcome would be about 4,000 lives saved each year.</p> <p>\"Britain already has one of the world's toughest tobacco control policies, but greater action on smuggling might help cut smoking further,\" the doctors write. </p> <p>Tobacco smuggling has fallen substantially since the government announced a strategy against the problem in 2000, but the doctors say more needs to be done. They urge the government to follow other European countries in signing legally enforceable agreements with the tobacco firms Philip Morris International and Japan Tobacco International, to ensure these companies control tobacco distribution and stop supplying contractors who have smuggling links.</p> <p>The doctors believe clamping down on smuggling could also reduce the huge disparity in health problems between socioeconomic groups, as poorer smokers might quit if prices rose.</p> <p>This year Customs officials seized contraband tobacco at British ports and prior to shipment of the material. In April 101m cigarettes destined for Britain were taken in Liege, Belgium. The following month 8m Regal King Size cigarettes were seized at Belfast docks; the \u00a32.4m haul would have evaded duty taxes of about \u00a31.8m.</p> <p>Responsibility for tackling smuggling is soon to pass to the UK Border Agency. </p> <p>The doctors call on the government to restrict tobacco sales and distribution, and use methods such as overt and covert marking of tobacco products to track items from makers to retailers. They suggest manufacturers should be responsible for controlling the supply chain of their products and face serious financial penalties for failing to do so.</p> <p>The World Health Organisation says smoking kills one third to a half of all those using tobacco, amounting to more than 5 million people a year worldwide.</p>",

Against a backdrop of forlorn sunsets and Weetabixy riverbeds, the historian sighs his way through the notion of water as social lubricant and the ongoing battle between the American Dream and ecological indifference. In the words of one 19th-century pioneer, his apple-pie zeal reduced to crumbs by the enormity of the Colorado river: \"We are but pygmies ... lost, under the boulders.\" You said it, pal. </p> <p><strong>Wire in the Blood </strong><br>9pm, ITV1 </p> <p>Someone's been bludgeoning hunks in a dungeon before shooting them and burying them in areas of outstanding natural beauty.

  "<p>It is a truth universally acknowledged that no cyclist looks good in shorts. This is all the more veracious a fact when one is confronted with such garments actually designed for bicycling, which incorporate a panel of padding in the gusset that makes the wearer look as though they are wearing an alarmingly bulky nappy.</p> <p>Spare a thought, then, for the brave ladies modelling the cursed things at Earl's Court in London yesterday, who had been paid by the Cycle Show - an annual exhibition to showcase the best in biking, which is on until Sunday - to prove that hey, cyclists can look cool too.</p> <p>The models fared better than the rest of us would, largely because they dodged stumpy-leg-syndrome by cheating, and wore their shorts with the sort of high heels that even the most dedicated cycling fashionista wouldn't dare pedal in. But overall, the fashion show was merely a reminder that however trendy cycling might have become - what with folding bikes replacing capacious handbags as the trendsetter's accessory of choice - teaming Lycra with a fluorescent cagoule is never the nattiest of looks.</p> <p>That doesn't stop half of the exhibition centre being jammed full of enough stretchy, luminous fabric to cover Chris Hoy's thighs many times over. There is, however, one oasis in this migraine-triggering, Mr Motivator-recalling sea of neon. It belongs to Rapha, routinely described as the Prada of cycling. </p> <p>This fledgling British label was founded by a dapper man called Simon Mottram in 2004, who had the radical thought that just because a person was into cycling, didn't mean they didn't care about looking good. \"Up until recently, the cycling industry put all the emphasis on how things performed, and didn't pay much attention to how they looked,\" said Mottram yesterday. \"That didn't make any sense to me. Why should people have to squeeze themselves into a day-glo skinsuit? Why should cyclists compromise on style?\"</p> <p>Pride of place on the Rapha stand yesterday was a really rather lovely jacket in a Prince of Wales check, lined with a breathable membrane to keep the wearer sweat-free. Perhaps the biggest compliment you could pay it is that it doesn't look like cycle gear, despite clever yet discreet touches, such as a flap that folds down to keep the wearer's bum dry on the saddle, which can be tucked away when not on the bike. Fantastic - except that it costs \u00a3450.</p> <p>\"It's outrageously indulgent,\" admitted Luke Scheybeler, head of design at Rapha. \"But our customers want to look good, and are prepared to pay for it. They are designers, entrepreneurs or consultants; many work in the City. Or rather, they did.\"</p> <p>Surely now is the wrong time for such frippery? Apparently not: all 100 of the limited edition sold out before they were even available. </p> <p>But the Cycle Show isn't just about fashion. It's about making life easier and more comfortable for bikers.</p> <p>There are folding tandems, whizzy electric gear and breaking systems and even saddles which claim to be \"gynaecologically tested\" (they monitor the blood flow to \"that area\", explained the coy salesman on the Selle Royal outlet).</p> <p>More than one stand appeared to be doing a roaring trade in electric bikes, far cheaper than a moped at around \u00a31,500, and good for cyclists with mobility (or laziness) problems.</p> <p>One stall advertised Italy Bike Hotels, the first Italian hotel chain designed especially for cyclists. That means each establishment has a laundry service that won't ruin technical fabrics, workshops for emergency repairs and a safe place to lock bikes, plus reception staff who can recommend cycling itineraries.</p> <p>The most unfortunately named stall belonged to a German firm called Puky, which offered a huge range of colourful bikes, trikes and go-karts for children.</p> <p>Mostly, though, the exhibition is a chance for bike nuts to dribble over machines they will never be able to afford, with carbon frames lighter than a box of tissues, components that flow like runny honey and livery that makes the rider look as though they have won a stage at the Tour de France.</p> <p>Over the next three days, visitors will even be able to touch their cycling idols - Olympians Nicole Cooke and Shanaze Reade will be around on Sunday and tomorrow, respectively.</p> <p>But there's no point buying a new bike if some imbecile steals it, which is where <a href=\"http://www.ilovemybike.co.uk\">ilovemybike.co.uk</a> comes in.</p> <p>A not-for-profit insurance scheme, it offers a better deal than many non-specialist insurers, promising to reimburse customers with the full cost of their bike as new (rather than what it was worth when it was pinched), and even something called \"get you home\" cover, which promises to pick you - and what's left of your bike - up from the crime scene and take you home.</p> <p>Yannick Read, manning the stall yesterday, had some tips for the owners of the estimated half a million bikes which get stolen each year. Some are predictable, such as never putting the lock so near the ground that it can easily be smashed. But one hint is beautiful in its simplicity. \"Putting a basket on your bike puts people off - even thieves want street cred.\"</p> <h2>The must-have accessories</h2> <p><strong>Rainlegs</strong><br>Anyone used to cycling in Britain will be well acquainted with wet-leg-itis, when the front of your trousers get soaked while your bottom and backs of thighs remain dry.

  "<p>The global economic crisis means financial re-regulation is, finally, on the agenda. Most agree it is needed on a global level. Some say this is impossible in a world of self-interested sovereign states, but we disagree: it is possible if we look at the context in which regulation is embedded. There we find the essence of the problem: tax havens. The offshore world created the conditions that led to this crisis, and unless the offshore world is tackled, it will undermine all efforts to deal with it.</p> <p>What do tax havens do? In truth, the term is a misnomer, and we prefer the term \"secrecy jurisdictions\". This is because they offer not one thing but three: low or zero taxes, secrecy, and lax regulation. In doing so they \"compete\" against reputable countries, trying to outdo them on ever lower corporate taxes and laxer regulation. As we said in our June submission to the Treasury committee on offshore financial centres, tax havens set out deliberately to \"undermine the impact of legislation passed in other jurisdictions\". This is their core business, and this is the threat they pose to the world.</p> <p>The impact of this is now visible in the economic crisis. The banking system has ceased to function because banks do not trust their peers' finances, structures and accounting disclosure. Opacity has been at the heart of the matter, and it is secrecy jurisdictions that create this opacity. First, they offer secrecy. All major banks have taken advantage of this, assisted by the \"big four\" firms of accountants who operate in all the world's significant tax havens.</p> <p>Second, they create uncertainty about who owns what. Offshore entities were used to isolate ownership of financial vehicles from onshore parents to secure higher credit ratings. The arrangements are often abusive, involving trusts and supposed charities. The result was, for instance, that when Northern Rock was nationalised, the Commons did not know whether this meant its Jersey-based shadow, Granite, was too. Its \u00a340bn of assets apparently existed in limbo. In consequence it is often the case that nobody knows who will honour the debts of what are, legally, separate entities. All of the victims of the current crisis had plunged very deep into this style of offshore operation.</p> <p>Third, they generate complexity, a form of opacity. Complexity has without doubt been used to shift risk from big institutions to society. Companies have spread complex structures across jurisdictions to exploit regulatory gaps. Even if each haven's claim to be properly regulated were true, the regulation of such firms falls between stools, since each jurisdiction only accepts responsibility for what happens in its domain. Regulation cannot function in such a world - a fact the failing banks exploited. And tax havens will enable many beneficiaries of the years of exuberance to protect their winnings in offshore black boxes, even if law courts wish otherwise.</p> <p>These havens are not just the palm-fringed islands of popular imagination. They are also places at the heart of the global economy. In particular the City has many offshore features. The IMF thinks London is offshore. When coupled with links to satellite havens like Jersey and Cayman, it becomes clear that Britain must be central to a global response to this problem. Gordon Brown and his predecessors have ignored this. As a result they have knowingly permitted the harm which secrecy jurisdictions wreak on the poor at home and abroad. Unless they are tackled, tax havens will sabotage any efforts to build global governance and international cooperation.</p> <p>That is why we must gear up for a global fight against tax havens. In the long term this push must stop regulation being embedded in a context riddled with powerful actors deliberately aiming to undermine it. More immediately, it must help policymakers address the crisis's fallout by giving them back powers to tax wealth and capital properly, and constrain what is a hothouse for cross-border crime. </p> <p>Tackling the increasing tension between global integration and a lack of credible international governance is impossible while these jurisdictions and their financial and criminal communities thwart attempts to deploy democratic controls. We emphasise, the secrecy jurisdictions' role in this is generic. Undermining democratic accountability is what they do for a living.</p> <p>Politicians can, and must, be braver now - public interest demands it.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard Murphy is a chartered accountant and founder of Tax Research LLP and Tax Justice Network; John Christensen is an economist and director of Tax Justice Network <a href=\"http://www.taxjustice.net\">taxjustice.net</a></p>",

I would normally go to the range now and hit balls for an hour or so but that's not going to be the case because obviously I have to look after my back.\"</p> <p>Broadhurst said he needed to take his game from the practice range to the course if he was to chalk up his seventh European Tour title. \"My game's been a little bit fragile all season,\" he said.\"I seem to have a body transplant when I get on the first tee. Today I had to hit a couple of miracle shots to keep the round together.\"</p> <p>Carlsson was involved in a heated exchange with the tournament director, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Zamora, over slow play after his 67 but the 28-year-old took little time at the 15th where he holed out from 125 yards for an eagle two. Fraser, who won the 2003 Russian Open, had the only unblemished round on a breezy day.

  "<p>As the presidential race lurches into its final weeks and John McCain struggles to make a dent in Barack Obama's lead in the polls, the tone at his rallies has grown increasingly negative.</p> <p>The McCain campaign yesterday sought to distance itself from ugly remarks by supporters, with a spokesman emailing reporters to say the camp \"does not condone the inappropriate rhetoric\" - a reference to shouts of \"treason,\" \"terrorist\" and \"kill him\" by audience members at McCain events following mentions of Obama. The Arizona senator himself has yet to directly address the negative comments.</p> <p>McCain aides alluded to a coming change in tone in interviews on Friday. \"We are looking for a very aggressive last 30 days,\" McCain adviser Greg Strimple told the Washington Post. \"We are looking forward to turning a page on this financial crisis and getting back to discussing Mr. Obama's aggressively liberal record and how he will be too risky for Americans.\"</p> <p>Obama and the Democrats say the strategy represents a transparent attempt to distract voters from the economy, an issue on which voters give Obama the advantage, with Democrats independent of the Obama campaign characterising it as a ploy to energise voters who harbour racial animosity and fear.</p> <p>Among other lines of attack, the McCain campaign has insinuated that the Illinois senator is friendly with a 1960s-era radical who collaborated in a series of bombings and is now an education professor in Chicago, William Ayers, and has asked voters to question who Obama is.</p> <p>At a rally in Waukesha, Wisconsin today, McCain said, \"We need to know the full extent of the relationship.\"</p> <p>Obama served on a non-profit board with Ayers, who also held a small fundraising event for Obama early in his political career. Obama has said the two are not friendly and are no longer associated in any way, and no evidence has surfaced to the contrary. </p> <p>When asked in an interview by ABC's Charles Gibson if he thought Obama's relationship with Ayers was a factor in the presidential campaign McCain said \"I think it's a factor about Senator Obama's candor and truthfulness with the American people. That's what I think it's about. As I say, I don't care about Mr Ayers who on September 11, 2001 said he wished he'd have bombed more. I don't care about that. I care about him being truthful about his relationship with him. And Americans will care.\"</p> <p>But Republicans are aware that it is logically impossible to prove a negative, and McCain has pushed that to his advantage.</p> <p>\"It's now clear that John McCain would rather launch angry, personal attacks than talk about the economy or defend his risky bail-out scheme that hands over billions in taxpayer dollars to the same irresponsible Wall Street banks and lenders that got us into this mess \u2013 a scheme that guarantees taxpayers will lose money,\" Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor said in a statement, referring to a recent McCain economic proposal. </p> <p>\"While Barack Obama ensured that the rescue plan that passed Congress protects taxpayers and homeowners, John McCain's scheme has been panned by experts and observers from across the political spectrum.\"</p> <p>At rallies this week in Florida, crowds jeered and taunted members of the news media. One man hurled a racial epithet at a black television crewman, telling him, \"Sit down, boy\".</p> <p>Yesterday, for the second time in three days, a speaker at a McCain rally in Pennsylvania referred to Obama's middle name, Hussein, in an effort to cast doubt on his religion and background. Obama is a Christian.</p> <p>At the same rally, shouts of \"terrorist\" and \"liar\" could be heard following references to the Democratic candidate. On Saturday, McCain running mate Sarah Palin sought to link Obama to Ayers. \"Kill him!\" one man in the crowd shouted, not specifying who.</p> <p>\"We do not condone this inappropriate rhetoric which distracts from the real questions of judgment, character and experience that voters will base their decisions on this November,\" McCain spokesman Paul Lindsay said yesterday.</p> <p>However, Democrats maintain that the rhetoric is being used as a fear tactic.</p> <p>\"It is a wink and nod towards the far right wing and it is embarrassing that any mainstream political party in America would still stoop to these lows,\" said Paul Neaville, a Democratic consultant who worked for Hillary Clinton's campaign. He said the McCain campaign could do more to repudiate those negative remarks.</p> <p>\"It could go to black neighbourhoods and open offices, it could advertise on minority radio\u2014but it chooses not to because part of their core constituency has a problem with minorities who are poor,\" he said. </p> <p>Democratic consultant Erick Mullen, an aide to General Wesley Clark's 2004 bid for the Democratic nomination, said the rhetoric emanating from the dais at McCain rallies show McCain is \"either a bad leader or a bad liar\". </p> <p>\"The McCain/Palin stagecraft has been extremely well controlled since the GOP convention so it's inconceivable to me that McCain has not tacitly approved the vulgarities uttered from the podium,\" he wrote in an email. \"Or Senator McCain cannot control his own junior staff and party operatives.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, President George Bush took the first step toward handing over the keys to the White House to the next president, establishing a committee to facilitate the transition to the next president, whether its Obama or McCain. </p> <p>The committee, which will consist of top Bush aides, will help the next president determine staffing needs during the transition, coordinate orientations at executive branch agencies and prepare briefing materials for the next president's appointees.</p> <p>The next president will be sworn in January 20, but considering the state of the US economy he will not have the luxury of resting the roughly three months following the election.</p> <p>White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said today that Bush's committee will help the next president hit the ground running in January.</p> <p>\"This is especially important as our nation is fighting a war, dealing with a financial crisis and working to protect ourselves from future terrorist attacks,\" she said.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.lucasarts.com/games/fracture/\">Fracture</a>, released tomorrow, reminds me of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Faction\">Red Faction</a>, the ancient PS2 game-with-a-gimmick. And like Red Faction, Fracture is all about manipulating your environment, though this time it's the ground that you get to play with. While Red Faction supposedly allowed you to shoot through corridor walls, in practice the destruction was so signposted that you may as well have been shooting open doors. Fracture is similarly limiting. The gimmick this time round is the ability to manipulate your terrain. This is impressive at first but it soon subsides, leaving you feel more like Bob the Builder than a super space marine as you settle into a pattern of raising and lowering the ground only when obviously needing to. And it is usually very obvious when you need to, for example, create a hill.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338466434\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1847310432_12511-fracture-guardian-vf-169-v1a-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Take away the terraforming and you are left with a very average shooter. There's nothing new here, with Halo and Call of Duty 4 obvious inspirations. The graphics are as bland as the gameplay, with brown, blacks and greens doing their best to sap your enthusiasm. And that's assuming you have any left. Fracture is infuriatingly tough in places. Inconsistently placed checkpoints \u2013 which often mean a tedious retracing of steps \u2013 and a punishing number of enemies do little to make you love the game.<br> Fracture is clearly a tech demo that has been over-stretched into a game. With the rush of big titles hitting in the next few weeks the chances of Fracture setting the charts alight are slight. But if it does sell a sequel with a bit more freedom and a wider use of the powers could be worth waiting for. For now though, Fracture is unlikely to make the earth move for you.</p>",
  "<p>It hasn't been the most positive week for the US-led International Security Force for Afghanistan (ISAF). Last week, a French newspaper leaked a secret cable in which Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles, Britain's ambassador to that country said the situation in Afghanistan is getting worse and its government is mired in corruption. According to the report, Cowper-Coles, a man who is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/jun/22/uk.afghanistan\">no stranger to controversy</a>, said only \"an acceptable dictator\" could guarantee stability in the country. <br> That was followed on Sunday by remarks from Mark Carleton-Smith, commander of British forces in the country, that a decisive victory against the Taliban <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4887927.ece\">is impossible</a>. Carleton-Smith said the Afghan conflict can only be ended through a political solution that includes the Taliban. His comments were supported by General Jean-Louis Georgelin, the chief of the French army.<br> Carleton-Smith was in part reacting to reports of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/28/afghanistan.defence\">peace talks</a> between the Taliban and the Afghan government mediated by Saudi King Abdullah in Mecca last month. Such initiatives \"should not make people uncomfortable\", said Britain's top military commander in Afghanistan, \"[because] that's precisely the sort of progress that concludes insurgencies like this\".<br> Those words were <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=28436&amp;Cr=Afghan&amp;Cr1=\">echoed</a> by the UN's top official in Afghanistan. \"We all know that we cannot win it militarily,\" said UN special envoy to Afghanistan Kai Eide. \"It has to be won through political means. That means political engagement.\"</p> <p>Whether or not Afghanistan is on the brink of collapse, the current mood reflects the growing realisation that military might alone cannot create stability. The Taliban may represent the most virulent strand of militant Islam, but it is also a major player in Afghanistan that has resisted successive attempts at its eradication. Britain and the UN's highest officials in Afghanistan have concluded that dialogue must replace open hostilities.<br> Unsurprisingly, Whitehall and Washington have dismissed such talk, although British foreign secretary David Milliband has not gone as far as denying Cowper-Coles' alleged comments.  US Defence Secretary Robert Gates described the claims of impending military defeat in Afghanistan as <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE49607N20081007\">defeatist</a>. Officially, everyone from Karzai in Kabul to Bush in Washington are talking tough about the Taliban.<br> Yet it seems even the US defence community has doubts about the strategy in Afghanistan. Yesterday the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/world/asia/09afghan.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin\">reported</a> that a major US intelligence estimate concludes that Afghanistan is in a \"downward spiral\". It effectively confirms what others like Carleton-Smith and Eide having been saying.<br> According to the New York Times, the leaked draft of this year's National Intelligence Estimate cites a breakdown in the Karzai government's authority, and an increase in corruption and the heroin trade, as having fundamentally undermined attempts to create a stable nation state. Last year's National Intelligence Estimate gained wide international coverage because it concluded, contrary to Bush Administration claims, that Iran did not possess nuclear weapons and had <a href=\"http://www.dni.gov/press_releases/20071203_release.pdf\">halted its attempts</a> to produce them in 2003.</p> <p>If the Times report is accurate, this year's NIE may prove to be another embarrassment for the Bush administration. On the positive side, it might also indicate that the bureaucrats are turning on the cold showers of realism sorely missed during the past eight years of Bush militarism that has fed on the simple, mythical belief in military solutions to complex social and political problems.<br> The conclusions reached in this year's NIE about US involvement in Afghanistan should come as no surprise. President Karzai does not control Afghanistan, despite the support of the world's only superpower and his success in presidential elections in 2004. He is known derisively in Afghanistan as the mayor of Kabul owing to his inability to control the vast territory beyond the country's capital. Those vast territories are almost entirely under the control of Afghanistan's feared warlords. It is arguable that Karzai has no choice but to curry favour with warlords: in a country devastated by decades of war and with a population mired in poverty, military might has been the only guarantor of immediate political power. But we shouldn't be under the illusion that warlordism developed in Afghanistan organically. The US, along with Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, had much to do with that power equation from the very moment it decided to militarise and Islamise Afghan society to defeat the Soviet Union. When the US swept into Afghanistan in October 2001, it paid several millions to warlords in an effort to create an alliance against the Taliban and capture it's and Al Qaeda's chief commanders. The problem then, unlike in the decade after the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, was not that the US neglected Afghanistan. Rather, the US invested in the very people who helped turn the sleepy haven for hippies that was Afghanistan in the 1970s into one of the most brutal conflict zones in the world. Many, including the current Democrat-controlled Congress, have been critical of the unaccountable billions the US has pumped into Afghanistan. Most of that money has been spent on the war with the Taliban. Little consideration has been given for the long term repercussions of war for the development of the country. It is perhaps telling that the increase in soul-searching over Afghanistan comes during the death throes of the Bush administration. Last month it commissioned a review of US policy on Afghanistan. US officials openly admit that the review will not dramatically alter current policies. Rather, it is aimed at assisting the next administration. Bush officials may soon have to justify eight years of the same, failed military campaign in Afghanistan. Unfortunately, the next President is likely to continue with more of the same. McCain and particularly Obama both speak of escalating the war with the Taliban. Whichever candidate wins in November, however, facts on the ground may compel him to replace the war plans with a negotiating table.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown has told the Icelandic prime minister that he is considering legal action against the country over the collapse of its national banks.</p> <p>The prime minister said tonight that Iceland's decision not to recompense those with savings in the bank was \"completely unacceptable\" and the British government would do \"whatever is necessary to recover the money\".</p> <p>\"I've spoken to the Icelandic prime minister, I have told him this is effectively an illegal action that they have taken. We are freezing the assets of Icelandic companies in the UK where we can. We will take further action against the Icelandic authorities where necessary to recover the money.</p> <p>\"We are talking to the local authorities to see what we can do to help them.\"</p> <p>Brown's comments came after it emerged that the chancellor, Alistair Darling, was to send a team to Iceland to help solve the stricken economy's financial problems.</p> <p>The Icelandic PM, Geir Haarde, announced that move after talks with Darling. He also urged his country to not panic after a third bank toppled today, and he asked the public to hold back from drawing large amounts of money in attempt to salvage their savings.</p> <p>Such a move would make the country's situation more difficult, he said.</p> <p>\"I want to emphasise ... that people remain calm and understand that the transaction system is fully functioning and deposits are safe.</p> <p>\"I also ask the public not to withdraw large sums of money from the banks. It will make things more difficult.\"</p> <p>Haarde also said he had spoken to Darling, who had assured him that transactions between the two countries would return to normal.</p> <p>Brown said yesterday that the UK government would compensate individual savers with Icesave, and vowed to take legal action against Iceland to recoup any losses. Unlike Icesave, Kaupthing's UK accounts were already covered by Britain's banking guarantee.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/09/localgovernment.banks\">up to 20 UK councils who banked with Icesave</a> could lose millions of pounds because wholesale deposits are not protected. The Tories have estimated that up to \u00a31bn may be at stake.</p> <p>The LGA has urged the government to guarantee them against any losses, and the prime minister's official spokesman said the government was willing to discuss the problem with local authorities \"to see if we can find a way though\". </p> <p>\"The government does understand the situation that they [the councils] are in. We have had difficulties getting complete clarity from the Icelandic authorities for all UK depositors.\"</p> <p>Pressed on whether the government would extend its guarantee to the Icelandic banks, the spokesman said: \"We are trying to extract information from them [the Icelandic authorities] about the scale of the deposits. We need to established what the facts are.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business+world/iceland\">financial meltdown in Iceland</a> continued this morning when Kaupthing became the third bank to fall into the hands of the authorities, and trading on the Icelandic stock market was halted.</p> <p>The Nordic nation's government also used sweeping new emergency powers to create a new bank that will take over the bulk of the domestic operations of another one of its collapsed banks. </p> <p>Kaupthing was forced to turn to the country's financial watchdog after the evaporation of confidence in the Icelandic economy left it unable to keep operating as a private company.</p> <p>The collapse of Iceland's biggest bank comes just days after Glitnir and Landsbanki were also nationalised. Virtually the entire top-heavy Icelandic banking system is now under state control. Haarde has warned the situation is putting Iceland at risk of \"national bankruptcy\".</p> <p>He acknowledged that the banking sector had \"become too big\" and said that it will take the tiny Nordic nation of just 320,000 people several years to recover from the current crisis. </p> <p>Iceland's whole economy appears on the verge of breakdown, with debts 12 times larger than its GDP. Its stock exchange was today shut down until Monday, due to the \"unusual market conditions\". Three days ago trading in financial firms was stopped.</p> <p>Sigurdur Einarsson, executive chairman of Kaupthing, claimed that the company had been performing well just two weeks ago, before the first reports of problems at Glitnir sparked panic.</p> <p>\"Credit rating agencies downgraded their credit ratings for the Icelandic state and the Icelandic banks, and foreign investors unleashed a landslide in which they tried to get rid of Icelandic assets, regardless of how solid they were,\" he said.</p> <p>Einarsson also appeared to lay some of the blame on the UK, claiming that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/oct/08/savings.banks2\">the panic over Landsbanki's Icesave deposit scheme</a> had led to a flood of funds out of Kaupthing Edge, his bank's UK offering.</p> <p>Kaupthing's British operations were placed in administration yesterday by the UK's Financial Services Authority. Its \u00a33bn of deposits were swiftly sold to ING, leaving hundreds of staff fearing for their future.</p> <p>The crisis at Kaupthing has also forced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/09/investing.moneyinvestments\">property tycoon Robert Tchenguiz to sell major stakes in J Sainsbury and Mitchells &amp; Butlers, Britain's largest pub operator,</a> leaving the billionaire nursing losses estimated to exceed to more than \u00a3800m.</p>",
  "<p>There has already been approximately <a href=\"http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/10/08/editorial-roundup-newspapers-weigh-second-presidential-debate/\">1,375,294 words written</a> about Tuesday night's <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5irCWkOK7mXeHKYSxW_Ux2TISdKQwD93MLP701\">presidential debate</a> between Barack Obama and John McCain, much of it falling into the usual metaphor of a sports contest. But talk of home runs or goals or touch-downs, or whatever the vocabulary of your preferred sport might be, misses the point.</p> <p>When I look back on those 90 minutes I don't see a game of football. It was much more significant than that. For me Tuesday night was the moment at which Obama finally cloaked himself in the mantle of president.</p> <p>It was like watching him emerge from the pupa in which he has been metamorphosing for the past two years and spread his wings. The politician on display was not the same politician I first saw <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/dec/12/usa.barackobama \">dazzling a crowd in New Hampshire</a> in December 2006. Yes there have been flashes of his potential along the way \u2013 plenty of them. He has at times been charistmatic, statesmanlike, inspirational and his oratorical powers have never been in doubt. But this week those elements all came together in one presidential package.</p> <p>What does it mean to look presidential? That's the perennial question that hangs over all American presidential elections and millions of dollars and thousands of hours of effort are devoted to trying to answer it.</p> <p>It is both the most complex and the simplest question in US politics. Simplest because you know it when it you see it. And I saw it on Tuesday night.</p> <p>Obama was calm and in control, both of his own emotions and the media event in which he participated. When he talked about the financial crisis he rose in stature, as if he were drawing strength from the global meltdown. McCain, by contrast, appeared overwhelmed by the scale of the disaster.</p> <p>If you know a presidential look when you see it, the converse also holds true. Earlier this year I spent weeks travelling round America visiting previous <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/mar/29/uselections2008.usa\">failed presidential candidates</a>. They were a very fine bunch of individuals, including a man who, like many before me including Hunter S Thompson, I came to admire very deeply \u2013 George McGovern. But even he had that look, the look of the loser. I saw it again this week, in John McCain.</p> <p>In hindsight the people I talked to lost because they fell into one of three categories. Some were insufficiently charismatic in the age of the television soundbite (Walter Mondale) others were swimming against the tide of history (Michael Dukakis) or brought down by their ill-considered choice of running mate (McGovern). </p> <p>John McCain is unique. He falls into all three.</p> <p>In his increasingly desperate attempts to dent Obama's armour plating, he says that America does not have the luxury for its next president to have on-the-job training. But by repeating that mantra, as he did again on Tuesday, he merely shows that he has not been paying attention.</p> <p>The truth is, Obama has spent the past two years engaging in precisely that \u2013 intensive on-the-job training. He started the crash course in January 2007 as a little-known first-time senator from Illinois. On Tuesday night he graduated. Barack Obama is ready to be president.</p>",
  "<p>My first summer out of university was spent working for <a href=\"http://music.guardian.co.uk/tonywilson\">Tony Wilson</a> at the In the City <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/festivals\">festival</a>, a event that takes place each year in Manchester. It was my job to recruit the music-industry bigwigs who made up the event's famed \"talking shops\". The conversations with these people's PAs would often go something like this:</p> <p>\"So would your high-powered music executive, at a time when his business is already starting to collapse, like to come to Manchester and get a load of abuse about how crap he is at his job?\"</p> <p>\"Er, no. Now please don't call again.\" </p> <p>This was always In the City's gift and its curse. When the late, great Tony Wilson founded the event with his partner, Yvette Livesey (even though, as he always pointed out, the idea was originally hers), the dream was to found a British version of Midem in Cannes, or Austin's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/southbysouthwest\">South By Southwest</a>. It did a fine job of uncovering talent (Muse, Coldplay and the Darkness all played In the City shows). But, as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alanmcgee\">Alan McGee</a> pointed out over the weekend: \"When you come to In the City, you're coming to Factory Records \u2013 it's just called In the City now.\" This has always been the case. And the thing about Tony \u2013 and by extension Factory, his label \u2013 is that he was known as a troublemaker.</p> <p>Plenty of industry folks stayed away from In the City because they knew the pasting they would get. So In the City never quite became an international phenomenon, because it always set itself at odds with the status quo, even if it was often ahead of its time. (Let's not forget that Tony foresaw the <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/uk/itunes/\">iTunes</a> model years ago with his music33 store, selling MP3s individually for 33p each \u2013 a serious underestimation of what people would be prepared to pay.)</p> <p>This year's conference was the first since Wilson's death last year, and it was so buzzing and well-attended that McGee suggested it was the \"most successful ever\". Walking round Manchester's Midland Hotel, you couldn't help but feel that this had a lot to do with the massive public affection for Tony himself. And you got the sense that all the people who treated Tony and his dreams with scorn during his life are paying their dues.</p> <p>More fundamentally, however, with the industry on its knees, you got the sense that this strange little \"talking shop\" has finally come into its own. And not just because nobody can quite believe <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/manchesterfestival\">how brilliant Manchester has become</a> as a city. With all the old certainties gone, there was wisdom to be mined from the UK's most creative cityscape. Certainly, there were more suits this year than I've ever witnessed in that hotel lobby. And that is surely in tribute to Tony.</p> <p>There were plenty of highlights. Nobody could replace Wilson as In the City's host and raconteur, but Andrew Loog Oldham filled his shoes as well as any living man could. Andy Burnham, the culture secretary, surprised almost everyone by coming over as a genuine music fan and supporter of artists' rights. Jarvis Cocker's lecture on the art of lyrics, Saying the Unsayable (previously <a href=\"http://www.acrylicafternoons.com/jarvisonsong.html\">delivered at the Brighton festival</a>), was hardly earth-shattering, but seeing him enthuse about his craft and perform acoustically in such an intimate setting is worth \u00a3500 of anyone's money. (Perhaps.)</p> <p>Elsewhere, seeing <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7661105.stm\">Seymour Stein</a> \u2013 the man who signed Madonna \u2013 correcting Columbia boss Mike Smith about the history of his own company during the final \"all-stars\" panel was hilarious, as was the panel wondering how music could ape the pornography industry's digital success.</p> <h2>Crosshead</h2> <p>The next Courteeners?</p> <p>As this year's slogan had it: \"It's all about the music, stupid.\" So here, based on what I saw and what various fine people recommended, is my pick of In the City 2008.

  "<p></p> <p>The future of mobile is not about the phone but about mobility, says dutch developer <strong>Stefan Fountain</strong>, of <strong><a href=\"http://www.soocial.com/intro\">Soocial</a></strong>. He already has reputation as a \"rock'n'roll developer\", whatever that means, and there's a good crowd for his talk.</p> <p>He talks about two key principles around mobile internet.</p> <p>The first is location: \"There's nothing more important to the human condition than the physical location we are at, and computers just don't know that. If we're in the bedroom we're busy or sleeping and don't want to be disturbed. The computer should know this.\" The <strong>iPhone</strong> might have the 'locate me now feature', but you have to tell it to tell you where you are. Location should be implicit. And he doesn't seem to have too many concerns over data privacy. \"In the past people were scared of trains, and thought that if the human body went faster then 40 mph it would disintegrate.\" He thinks we will move into a state of mutual consent between us and our devices. Mobile apps could go one step further; you could ask your phone for a good restaurant and it would simply say \"turn left\".</p> <p>Visibility is his second point, and this is about the ubiquity of technology. Once a technology becomes totally essential in your life, it becomes invisible. He talked about how technologies move towards the mainstream by commoditisation; they move from being a rare thing, through a stage with lots of copycats, to be standardised across different versions to a final state of ubiquity. (And then presumably, obsolescence, but he didn't get that far...)</p> <p>It is all about ubiquity, he says, about the harmonisation of environment, context and presence, and about services. It doesn't matter what the device is - it's about the data on that device and all those factors that make it relevant for someone. If you want to check your <strong>Gmail</strong>, you don't care if that is on your work computer, home computer, friend's computer or on mobile - all you want is the data.</p> <p>He showed a diagram of something resembling a sophisticated compost heap layered with, from the bottom up, the web, mobile devices, mobile data and mobile actions. As each of these sectors has evolved, the previous one has become slightly less visible.</p> <p>Time for the pitch, delivered in a slick, dubbed Knight Rider mashup... Soocial syncs contacts between different address book systems, so between the <strong>Mac Address Book</strong>, Gmail and its own web app but today announced support for <strong>Outlook</strong> and <strong>Blackberry</strong> too. Any Soocial users out there? Given the mess caused by Apple's <strong>MobileMe</strong> failing, repeatedly, I'm inclined to give it a try. Fountain says Soocial is destined to do well because \"all successful companies have two 'Os' in their name...\"</p> <p>And he finished by rousing the troops of developers in the audience, quoting computer scientist <strong><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/alan_kay_shares_a_powerful_idea_about_ideas.html\">Alan Kay</a></strong>'s famous line that 'the best way to predict the future is to invent it'. \"We have the power to control the future. We are able to make things, to shape things. We can create the blueprint and decide where we want to go.\"</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://london2008.futureofwebapps.com/partners\">Guardian.co.uk is a silver partner of Future of Web Apps</a></em><br></p>",

And few can be suffering more acutely than award-winning CBS Evening News correspondent <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/09/25/eveningnews/main3297511.shtml\">Dean Reynolds</a>, who's been putting a brave face on things for months, but who now finally lets his anger and frustration <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2008/10/07/politics/fromtheroad/entry4507703.shtml#ccmm\">erupt all over the CBS From The Road blog</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>The Obama aides who deal with the national reporters on the campaign plane are often overwhelmed, overworked and un-informed about where, when, why or how the candidate is moving about. Baggage calls are preposterously early with the explanation that it's all for security reasons. If so, I would love to have someone from Obama's campaign explain why the entire press corps, the Secret Service, and the local police idled for two hours in a Miami hotel parking lot recently because there was nothing to do and nowhere to go. It was not an isolated case. </p> </blockquote> <p>If you've recently received a home foreclosure notice, or you can't afford to fill your car with gas, you'll certainly sympathise with the appalling experiences Reynolds has been enduring as one of the downtrodden reporters forced to occupy a seat on Obama's press plane:</p> <blockquote> <p>Nor is there much sympathy for those of us who report for a newscast that airs in the early evening hours. Our shows place a premium on live reporting from the scene of campaign events. But this campaign can often be found in the air and flying around at the time the \"CBS Evening News with Katie Couric\" is broadcast.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hard to believe, I know, but it gets worse. Reynolds recently spent a few days on the McCain plane, and the contrast was so stark that it made him feel even more upset, frustrated and depressed:</p> <blockquote> <p>The McCain campaign plane is better than Obama's, which is cramped, uncomfortable and smells terrible most of the time. Somehow the McCain folks manage to keep their charter clean, even where the press is seated.</p> </blockquote> <p>For a moment towards the end of his tale of woe, Reynolds seems to waver, as if wondering whether, in this harsh world, anyone will take any notice of his cry for help:</p> <blockquote> <p>Maybe none of this means much.</p> </blockquote> <p>But it lasts only a moment. Then he picks himself up, takes a deep breath, rediscovers his courage, and reminds himself that one day -- maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday -- the law of Karma will catch up with Barack Obama, and the horrors he has inflicted will be met with an equal and opposite retaliation:</p> <blockquote> <p>...in politics, everything that goes around comes around.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is undeniably true: justice will triumph in the end. And this is what allows us, even in our darkest hours, to stay hopeful and strong. Because no matter how much pain and misery may be inflicted by those in power upon those they oppress, the indomitable human spirit will always win out eventually, especially when it is the indomitable human spirit of the award-winning CBS news reporter Dean Reynolds. </p>",
  "<p>Todd Palin talked with more than a dozen Alaska state officials, many of them repeatedly, in his crusade to get a state trooper fired who he considered to be a bad cop, a dishonest person and a threat to the Palin family, according to his sworn statement given yesterday to a legislative investigator in Alaska.</p> <p>The 25-page statement from Governor Sarah Palin's husband, in response to questions submitted by the investigator, shows that Todd Palin's efforts started before his wife became governor and accelerated during the first 19 months of her administration.</p> <p>He also suggested there was bad blood between the governor and former public safety commissioner Walt Monegan over two other matters, including an inquiry from Monegan to the governor about whether she once failed to put her infant son Trig in a car seat while she was driving.</p> <p>The other dispute involved the unavailability of a state trooper airplane for the governor's use when travelling to the Alaska's rural areas.</p> <p>On the car seat matter, Monegan sent an email to the governor on June 30, 12 days before he lost his job, that said: \"Via a soon-to-be-retiring legislator, we received a complaint that had you driving with Trig not in an approved car seat; if this is so that would be awkward in many ways.\"</p> <p>The governor fired back from her private email account: \"I've never driven Trig anywhere without a new, approved carseat. I want to know who said otherwise - pls provide me that info now.\"</p> <p>Todd Palin, in his sworn statement, said this was a \"false rumour\", and that the governor was a passenger in a truck, \"on a private farm road without traffic at low speed\".</p> <p>On the trooper airplane, \"It seemed that whenever Sarah needed this plane, it was unavailable,\" Todd Palin said. \"We were concerned that the department of public safety was retaliating against Sarah for selling the Murkowski jet that department of public safety officials enjoyed using.\" In 2007, the governor sold a jet her predecessor, Frank Murkowski, bought in controversial defiance of the legislature.</p> <p>Todd Palin was waging the campaign against his ex-brother-in-law, state trooper Mike Wooten, who had divorced the governor's sister in 2006 and who is involved in a custody fight.</p> <p>Two investigations - one by the legislature and one by the state personnel board - are under way over whether Governor Palin or members of her administration abused their powers in pushing for Wooten's firing, and whether their efforts resulted in the governor's dismissal of her public safety commissioner, Monegan, in July.</p> <p>The legislature ordered its investigation in late July, and until this week Todd Palin and officials of the governor's administration resisted subpoenas to tell what they know about Troopergate. </p> <p>Palin's statement yesterday comes after an Alaska judge last week refused to invalidate the subpoenas.</p> <p>In his statement, Palin is unapologetic about his efforts to get Wooten fired, but he says he doesn't think those efforts had anything to do with Monegan's dismissal. </p> <p>He said his understanding is that Monegan lost his job due to a \"dispute with the governor and her staff over budget issues and failure to fill trooper vacancies\".</p> <p>In his statement, Palin repeatedly discusses his quest to get Wooten dismissed, but said he never told Monegan to fire Wooten. He said Wooten threatened Palin's father-in-law, bullied people as a trooper, drove in his trooper car after drinking, improperly used his trooper car to shuttle his kids and falsified a workers' compensation claim. </p> <p>Wooten was suspended for five days in 2006 after troopers investigated complaints against him.</p> <p>\"I had hundreds of conversations and communications about trooper [Mike] Wooten over the last several years with my family, with friends, with colleagues, and with just about everyone I could - including government officials,\" Palin said.</p> <p>\"I talked about Wooten so much over the years that my wife told me to stop talking about it with her.\"</p> <p>He said by taking his concerns to Monegan he was following the instructions regular citizens get for complaining about troopers.</p> <p>\"There is absolutely nothing improper about lodging concerns about trooper [Mike] Wooten with Monegan or his predecessor - complaints about state troopers are supposed to go to the commissioner,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I make no apologies for wanting to protect my family and wanting to publicise the injustice of a violent trooper keeping his badge and abusing the worker compensation system. The real investigation that needs to be conducted for the best interests of the public at large is the department of public safety's unwillingness to discipline its own.\"</p>",
  "<p>Modern Egypt has been <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/egypt-the-surreal-painting\">compared to a surrealist painting</a>: difficult to decipher and comprehend, dominated by dark, abrasive lines at the centre yet giving way to softer, more hopeful brush strokes at the periphery. Tarek Osman, the excellent writer who conceived the metaphor, used it to describe the politics, society and culture of the nation as a whole. But it also works when applied to the country's complex media landscape, the shifting contours of which \u2013 in print, on television and through the web \u2013 have been thrown into sharp relief in recent days.</p> <p>The big news has been the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7656022.stm\">presidential pardon</a> of the controversial editor and outspoken regime critic Ibrahim Eissa, who sits at the helm of al-Dostour newspaper. This phenomenally popular daily has been a constant thorn in the government's side since it reopened in 2005 \u2013 seven years after being shut down for publishing an Islamist statement. In August last year, as whispers regarding Hosni Mubarak's health swirled through the streets, Eissa had the mendacity to <a href=\"http://elijahzarwan.net/blog/?p=819\">write</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The president in Egypt is a god and gods don't get sick. Thus, President Mubarak, those surrounding him, and the hypocrites hide his illness and leave the country prey to rumours. It is not a serious illness. It's just old age. But the Egyptian people are entitled to know if the president is down with something as minor as the flu.</p> </blockquote> <p>In an Orwellian doublespeak world where the president <a href=\"http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/Politics/Presidency/President/Interview/000001/0401050300000000000205.htm\">declares</a> his belief in press freedom to be \"unshakeable\" and promises that no journalist will go to jail for doing their job, that paragraph was enough to land Eissa in court, where he was accused of single-handedly undermining international confidence in Egypt's stability and wiping $350m off the stock market.</p> <p>The protracted legal drama that followed finally came to an end this week, when Mubarak used the occasion of Armed Forces Day to publicly revoke Eissa's two-month prison sentence, a sentence which <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gf7XYKC_zZv9Y-qby7mZt0dr9GagD93FQEUO0\">Eissa had warned</a> would \"open the gates of hell for the Egyptian press.\" The blogosphere was underwhelmed by the president's generosity. \"Mubarak is most misericordious and most merciful, is He not?\" commented a particularly <a href=\"http://arabist.net/archives/2008/10/07/eissa-released-by-mubarak/\">earnest fan</a>.</p> <p>On the face of it, Eissa's pardon does little to change the reality of press censorship in Egypt. As the Cairo-based journalist Will Ward has <a href=\"http://willward.wordpress.com/2008/10/07/eissa-pardon-no-is-victory-for-press-freedom/\">pointed out</a>, the case against Eissa was more about \"touching up\" the invisible red line prohibiting reports on the health of Mubarak, who turned 80 this year, than putting any individuals behind bars, and in this respect the state has got what it wanted. It's clear that any genuine commitment to freedom of expression can't be dependent on the arbitrary whims of a corrupt autocrat \u2013 hence the continued presence of those dark, abrasive lines at the centre of the painting, where control over information seems to flow in one direction only.</p> <p>But look closer and you'll see the picture become more complex. As the political analyst Khalil al-Anani has <a href=\"http://www.dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=16905\">observed</a> while exploring the efforts of the Egyptian state to protect itself by silencing civil opposition, \"the dilemma of authoritarian regimes is that they are stupid\". I've <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/07/egypt.middleeast\">written here before</a> about how the ruling elite's ham-fisted attempts to handle the independent media sector have backfired; in a globalised media environment it's simply impossible for the regime to \"get the cat back in the bag\" when it comes to the broadcasting of opposition voices in public.</p> <p>Moreover, legal attacks on prominent figures like Eissa are a source of keen embarrassment to the younger generation of party high-fliers clustered around the president's son Gamal, who preaches the rhetoric of openness and transparency (while climbing into bed with some of the country's most dishonest businessmen). This younger cadre is expected to make its voice heard at the ruling NDP's annual conference next month.</p> <p>The result is that such intermittent media crackdowns, the repainting of those thick dark lines on the picture, actually serve to blur the lineation of power in Egypt, creating new opportunities for other political actors to stake a claim.</p> <p>And the really interesting thing about the media landscape in Egypt is the way in which those other political actors are also being emboldened, checked and divided by the opening up of the country's media scene. The spread of internet access, while still largely restricted to the urban middle class and increasingly <a href=\"http://theegyptblog.blogspot.com/2008/08/egypt-demanding-data-from-cyber-cafs.html\">monitored by the government</a>, is funnelling a plurality of voices into the political mix, and the NDP aren't the only organisation to be shaken up by the ensuing turmoil.</p> <p>The Muslim Brotherhood, technically Egypt's largest opposition group despite being legally outlawed, is facing a tsunami of <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-brotherhood3-2008oct03,1,5596077.story\">dissent</a> from within its own ranks as young Islamist bloggers attack the conservative leadership for their stance on religious freedom and women's rights. The bloggers \"have gone beyond their role as a media tool\" for the brotherhood, according to a <a href=\"http://www.arabinsight.org/aiarticles/186.pdf\">recent edition</a> of Arab Insight, and have emerged instead as \"rebels, freed from ideological and organisational constraints.\" The dynamism of Egypt's new media has proved a double-edged sword for the Brotherhood's old guard, who have discovered, perhaps too late, that your enemy's enemy isn't always your friend.</p> <p>Despite the bitter setbacks faced by journalists across different formats trying to expose injustice and improbity at the heart of the Arab world's largest country, the government's suffocating grip on the media here is slowly weakening. There is nothing linear about this process: writers and activists whose work is channelled through the net are routinely <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0730/p04s04-wome.html\">rounded up</a>; the explosion of foreign satellite channels in recent years has been accompanied by <a href=\"http://www.metimes.com/International/2008/09/12/egypt_media_threatened_with_more_restrictions/3717/\">police raids</a> on programme-makers; the rise of independent ownership within the Egyptian newspaper industry is undermined by court cases against non-compliant editors.</p> <p>But the critical feature of this media environment is that these shocks to the system, the heavy-handed application of black lines on the canvas, are constantly creating new opportunities for colourful and unexpected brush strokes on the margins \u2013 and those margins are encroaching upon the centre day by day.</p>",
  "<p>The chancellor, Alistair Darling, is to send a team to Iceland to work on the stricken economy's financial issues, the Icelandic prime minister said today.</p> <p>Speaking at a news conference, Geir Haarde also urged his country to not panic by the topple of a third band today and asked the public to hold back from drawing large amounts of money in attempt to salvage their savings.</p> <p>Haarde said such a move would make the country's situation more difficult.</p> <p>\"I want to emphasise ... that people remain calm and understand that the transaction system is fully functioning and deposits are safe,\" Haarde said.</p> <p>\"I also ask the public not to withdraw large sums of money from the banks. It will make things more difficult.\"</p> <p>Haarde also said he had spoken to Darling, who had assured him that transactions between the two countries would return to normal.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business+world/iceland\">financial meltdown in Iceland</a> continued this morning when Kaupthing became the third bank to fall into the hands of the authorities, and trading on the Icelandic stock market was halted.</p> <p>The Nordic nation's government also used sweeping new emergency powers to create a new bank that will take over the bulk of the domestic operations of another one of its collapsed banks. </p> <p>Haarde also revealed that 550 staff at Landsbanki, Iceland's second largest bank which was taken over by the government earlier this week, had been let go.</p> <p>Asked in a news conference whether there would be more job losses at the bank, Haarde said he could not say. </p> <p>Kaupthing was forced to turn to the country's financial watchdog after the evaporation of confidence in the Icelandic economy left it unable to keep operating as a private company.</p> <p>The collapse of Iceland's biggest bank comes just days after Glitnir and Landsbanki were also nationalised. Virtually the entire top-heavy Icelandic banking system is now under state control. Haarde has warned the situation is putting Iceland at risk of \"national bankruptcy\".</p> <p>He acknowledged that the banking sector had \"become too big\" and said that it will take the tiny Nordic nation of just 320,000 people several years to recover from the current crisis. </p> <p>The board of Kaupthing has resigned, handing control of the bank to Iceland's Financial Supervisory Authority. The regulator has said that branches will be open for business, with domestic deposits fully guaranteed.</p> <p>Haarde tried to re-instill confidence saying that the government had full confidence in the board of the central bank. At least one prominent Icelandic politician has made a public call for the bank's board to be dismissed saying they had mishandled the financial crisis.</p> <p>Iceland's whole economy appears on the verge of breakdown, with debts 12 times larger than its GDP. Its stock exchange was today shut down until Monday, due to the \"unusual market conditions\". Three days ago trading in financial firms was stopped.</p> <p>Sigurdur Einarsson, executive chairman of Kaupthing, claimed that the company had been performing well just two weeks ago, before the first reports of problems at Glitnir sparked panic.</p> <p>\"Credit rating agencies downgraded their credit ratings for the Icelandic state and the Icelandic banks, and foreign investors unleashed a landslide in which they tried to get rid of Icelandic assets, regardless of how solid they were,\" he said.</p> <p>Einarsson also appeared to lay some of the blame on the UK, claiming that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/oct/08/savings.banks2\">the panic over Landsbanki's Icesave deposit scheme</a> had led to a flood of funds out of Kaupthing Edge, his bank's UK offering.</p> <p>Kaupthing's British operations were placed in administration yesterday by the UK's Financial Services Authority. Its \u00a33bn of deposits were swiftly sold to ING, leaving hundreds of staff fearing for their future.</p> <p>The crisis at Kaupthing has also forced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/09/investing.moneyinvestments\">property tycoon Robert Tchenguiz to sell major stakes in J Sainsbury and Mitchells &amp; Butlers, Britain's largest pub operator,</a> leaving the billionaire nursing losses estimated to exceed to more than \u00a3800m.<br> Yesterday, Gordon Brown said that the UK government will compensate individual savers with Icesave, and vowed to take legal action against Iceland to recoup any losses. Unlike Icesave, Kaupthing's UK accounts were already covered by Britain's banking guarantee.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/09/localgovernment.banks\">up to 20 UK councils who banked with Icesave</a> could lose millions of pounds because wholesale deposits are not protected.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/09/localgovernment.banks\">up to 20 UK councils who banked with Icesave</a> could lose millions of pounds because wholesale deposits are not protected.</p>",
  "<p>Labour brought in the minimum wage to stop people being exploited in the workplace. But the determination to pay a fair day's wage for a fair day's work does not seem to apply to Gordon Brown's government, where more than 10% of ministers and whips are working for free.</p> <p>There's already been a lot of comment about the reshuffle in print and on the blogosphere. But the more I look at it, the more extraordinary it seems, so here's a roundup of the key points for anyone who hasn't been following this closely.<br><strong><br>1. The government is bigger than ever.</strong> According to my calculations, there are now 121 ministers, whips or law officers. </p> <p>According to a note from the House of Commons library (which you can find <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/works/notes_on_parliament_and_constitution.cfm\">here</a>), there were 106 members of the government when Margaret Thatcher formed her first government in 1979 and 112 when Tony Blair formed his in 1997.</p> <p>If you go further back, Winston Churchill managed to fight the Nazis and defend the free world with just 74 ministers in his government. (That's the total paid government posts figure for 1940 from Twentieth Century British Political Facts.)<br><strong><br>2. The payroll vote is bigger than ever. </strong>The payroll vote refers to members of the government and parliamentary private secretaries. </p> <p><a href=\"http://waugh.standard.co.uk/2008/10/the-ever-expand.html\">Paul Waugh</a> has worked out that if you include the five non-PPS backbenchers who have been given jobs as regional ministers' assistants and the two backbenchers who have been made \"government representatives\" (ie, \"envoys\"), then there are 154 Labour MPs who have an official job of some description. That's 44% of the PLP.</p> <p>According to the Commons library note, the payroll vote numbered 121 in 1983, 134 in 1997 and 146 in 2001.</p> <p><strong>3. The cabinet is huge.</strong> Officially there are only 23 members of the cabinet. But another 10 ministers have the right to attend on some or all occasions, meaning there could be up to 33 people squeezed around the table.</p> <p><strong>4. The number of ministers working for free seems to be higher than ever. </strong>There are 13 ministers or whips working without a ministerial salary. This is because there's a statutory limit on the number paid ministerial posts you can have in a government.</p> <p>In the past particularly wealthy ministers have agreed not to take a salary. But now working for free seems to be the norm for anyone joining the government at a junior rank. <a href=\"http://lordsoftheblog.wordpress.com/2008/10/08/ministers-without-pay/\">Lord Norton</a>, a constitutional expert as well as a Tory peer, says he's \"not aware of the number of unpaid ministers being so high before\".<br><strong><br>5. Brown has now promoted most of those involved in the \"curry house plot\" against Tony Blair in 2006.</strong> As <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/rosa_prince/blog/2008/10/06/curry_house_coup_completed_by_gordon_browns_reshuffle\">Rosa Prince</a> has pointed out, 11 of the 15 members of the 2001 intake who signed a letter calling for Blair to quit have now got a government job or a select committee chairmanship.</p> <p><strong>6. The reshuffle shows that you don't actually have to be sitting in the Commons or the Lords to be a minister. </strong>As <a href=\"http://lordsoftheblog.wordpress.com/2008/10/07/the-new-ministers/\">Norton points out,</a> Peter Mandelson, Stephen Carter and Paul Myners are already fulfilling their ministerial duties even though they haven't taken their seats in the Lords.<br><strong><br>7. And we now have a minister for content.</strong> <a href=\"http://blogs.independent.co.uk/openhouse/2008/10/reshuffle-footn.html\">John Rentoul</a> has noticed that the official list of departmental responsibilities for the culture department shows that Carter will be in charge of communications and content industries.</p>",
  "<p><strong>FOREIGNERS AND THEIR FUNNY WAYS, DEFENDERS, ETC.</strong></p> <p>England's Brave John Terry certainly is one of the biggest and strongest characters in world sport. You only have to look at his courageous display at the Big Cup draw last month to see that. Picking up the award for Best Big Cup Defender Who Cost His Team The Cup By Not Letting A Striker Take The Glory Kick, he fearlessly strode to the stage without once slipping up or excreting gallons of salty discharge from his eyes, despite neither Ricardo Carvalho nor Rio Ferdinand being there to hold his hand. So it is with some regret that we have to report that EBJT is extremely unlikely to play in England's game against Kazakhstan this weekend, having yet again been unable to train today.</p> <p>What will England do without him? Play Wes Brown, Matthew Upson or most probably Joleon Lescott instead, give Ferdinand the captain's armband, then record an unimpressive 2-0 win, that is what. You see, as well as coming to the conclusion that Michael Owen has been complete a waste of space since 2004, England coach Fabio Capello is of the opinion that players need to be fully fit to represent their country in a sensible and measured manner, rather than filling themselves full of painkillers and flinging themselves into ludicrous challenges in order to prove how committed to the cause they are, and having their heads busted open all over their crisp white shirts. These foreigners and their funny ways, eh?</p> <p>With this amazing policy in mind, Terry also finds himself up against it to be fit in time for England's much more taxing unimpressive 1-0 win in Belarus next week. The loss of their captain is, if you don't bother to think about it for too long, or indeed at all, a terrible blow for England, but it is important to remember that defensive problems could be much worse. Scotland, preparing to face Norway and John Carew, for example, will be doing so with David Weir, 93, in their defence. Meanwhile France, already handicapped by having Raymond Domenech pick the team by consulting astral charts and a crystal ball, have been forced to replace the injured William Gallas with Jean-Alain Boumsong, a central defender so bad he couldn't even keep down a place at Newcastle United.

McCain repeatedly mentioned nuclear power, while Obama made the now-obligatory nod to \"clean coal.\"</p> <p>But for a few minutes in the middle of it all, the debate touched specifically on climate change with a question from an audience member that produced very different answers from the candidates.</p> <p>The question came from <a href=\"http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2008/10/8/9127/50970\">Ingrid Jackson</a>: <strong>\"Sen. McCain, I want to know, we saw that Congress moved pretty fast in the face of an economic crisis. I want to know what you would do within the first two years to make sure that Congress moves fast as far as environmental issues, like climate change and green jobs.\"</strong></p> <p>McCain's response nods at the importance of addressing climate change, but then goes on to stress that the United States needs to invest in a broad range of energy sources, particularly nuclear power. Here's his response in full:</p> <blockquote> <p>Well, thank you. Look, we are in tough economic times; we all know that. And let's keep \u2014 never forget the struggle that Americans are in today. But when we can \u2014 when we have an issue that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damaged planet, I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue. I traveled all over the world looking at the effects of greenhouse-gas emissions, Joe Lieberman and I.</p> <p> And I introduced the first legislation, and we forced votes on it. That's the good news, my friends. The bad news is we lost. But we kept the debate going, and we kept this issue to -- to posing to Americans the danger that climate change opposes. Now, how -- what's -- what's the best way of fixing it? Nuclear power. Sen. Obama says that it has to be safe or disposable or something like that.</p> <p> Look, I was on Navy ships that had nuclear power plants. Nuclear power is safe, and it's clean, and it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs. And I know that we can reprocess the spent nuclear fuel. The Japanese, the British, the French do it. And we can do it, too. Sen. Obama has opposed that. We can move forward, and clean up our climate, and develop green technologies, and alternate -- alternative energies for -- for hybrid, for hydrogen, for battery-powered cars, so that we can clean up our environment and at the same time get our economy going by creating millions of jobs.</p> </blockquote> <p>Obama, <a href=\"http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2008/10/7/192054/490\">in his response to the same question</a>, called for public investment in finding solutions to climate change, including support for wind, solar, and geothermal energy. He challenged McCain on his votes against <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/renewableenergy\">renewables</a> during his time in the Senate and directly countered the notion that drilling offshore is a solution to the nation's energy concerns:</p> <blockquote> <p>This is one of the biggest challenges of our times. And it is absolutely critical that we understand this is not just a challenge, it's an opportunity, because if we create a new energy economy, we can create 5 million new jobs, easily, here in the United States. It can be an engine that drives us into the future the same way the computer was the engine for economic growth over the last couple of decades.</p> <p> And we can do it, but we're going to have to make an investment. The same way the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out, for defense purposes, how to communicate, we've got to understand that this is a national security issue, as well. And that's why we've got to make some investments and I've called for investments in solar, wind, geothermal. Contrary to what Sen. McCain keeps on saying, I favor nuclear power as one component of our overall energy mix.</p> <p> But this is another example where I think it is important to look at the record. Sen. McCain and I actually agree on something. He said a while back that the big problem with energy is that for 30 years, politicians in Washington haven't done anything. What Sen. McCain doesn't mention is he's been there 26 of them. And during that time, he voted 23 times against alternative fuels, 23 times. So it's easy to talk about this stuff during a campaign, but it's important for us to understand that it requires a sustained effort from the next president.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>So far, the responses amount to the typical thrust and parry of the campaign, with the candidates jousting over political points and generalities about investing in alternative energy sources. But Obama, in directly taking on the Republicans' pro-drilling talking points, talked quite frankly about the scope of the climate challenge:</p> <blockquote> <p>One last point I want to make on energy. Sen. McCain talks a lot about drilling, and that's important, but we have 3 percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil. So what that means is that we can't simply drill our way out of the problem. And we're not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global warming. We're going to have to come up with alternatives, and that means that the United States government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like China that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week. We've got to make sure that we're giving them the energy that they need or helping them to create the energy that they need.</p> </blockquote> <p>Later in the debate, Obama again stressed the scale of the climate and energy crisis, making clear that there are no easy fixes. His response was prompted by a questioner who asked the candidates what sacrifices they would ask every American to make \"to help restore the American dream and to get out of the economic morass that we're now in.\" </p> <p>Obama said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Let's take the example of energy, which we already spoke about. There is going to be the need for each and every one of us to start thinking about how we use energy. I believe in the need for increased oil production. We're going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling. It includes telling the oil companies, that currently have 68 million acres that they're not using, that either you use them or you lose them. We're going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy.</p> <p> But each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes, in our buildings. And one of the things I want to do is make sure that we're providing incentives so that you can buy a fuel-efficient car that's made right here in the United States of America, not in Japan or South Korea, making sure that you are able to weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient. And that's going to require effort from each and every one of us.</p> </blockquote> <p>Overall, Tuesday night's debate seemed like one long discussion of the complex reality of energy markets, economic health, and national security. Pretty much the first sentence out of McCain's mouth, responding to a question about how to address the economic crisis, was to mention energy independence. \"I have a plan to fix this problem and it has got to do with energy independence,\" said McCain. \"We've got to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much.\"</p> <p>Later in the debate, McCain again referred to energy independence as key to addressing the economic crisis, pointing specifically to offshore drilling and nuclear power. \"You're going to be examining our proposals tonight and in the future, and energy independence is a way to do that, is one of them,\" said McCain. \"Drilling offshore and nuclear power are two vital elements of that. And I've been supporting those and I know how to fix this economy, and eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, and stop sending $700 billion a year overseas.\"</p> <p>Obama, too, mentioned energy as a key factor in fixing the economy: \"We are going to have to deal with energy because we can't keep on borrowing from the Chinese and sending money to Saudi Arabia. We are mortgaging our children's future,\" said Obama. \"We've got to have a different energy plan.\"</p> <p>Moderator Tom Brokaw also asked the candidates about what their priorities will be in office: \"Health policies, energy policies, and entitlement reform -- what are going to be your priorities in what order? Which of those will be your highest priority your first year in office and which will follow in sequence?\"</p> <p>McCain responded first, arguing, \"I think you can work on all three at once, Tom.\" On the energy portion, he again touted nuclear energy, as well as renewables:</p> <blockquote> <p>We can work on nuclear power plants. Build a whole bunch of them, create millions of new jobs. We have to have all of the above, alternative fuels, wind, tide, solar, natural gas, clean coal technology. All of these things we can do as Americans and we can take on this mission and we can overcome it. My friends, some of this $700 billion ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>On that same question, Obama listed energy as his top priority:</p> <blockquote> <p>We're going to have to prioritize, just like a family has to prioritize ... Energy we have to deal with today, because you're paying $3.80 here in Nashville for gasoline, and it could go up. And it's a strain on your family budget, but it's also bad for our national security, because countries like Russia and Venezuela and, you know, in some cases, countries like Iran, are benefiting from higher oil prices.</p> <p> So we've got to deal with that right away. That's why I've called for an investment of $15 billion a year over 10 years. Our goal should be, in 10 years' time, we are free of dependence on Middle Eastern oil. And we can do it. Now, when JFK said we're going to the Moon in 10 years, nobody was sure how to do it, but we understood that if the American people make a decision to do something, it gets done. So that would be priority No. 1.</p> <p>McCain at one point went after Obama on the now well-trod issue of the 2005 energy bill. \"It was an energy bill on the floor of the Senate loaded down with goodies, billions for the oil companies, and it was sponsored by Bush and Cheney. You know who voted for it? You might never know. That one,\" he said, gesturing toward Obama. \"You know who voted against it? Me. I have fought time after time against these pork barrel -- these bills that come to the floor and they have all kinds of goodies and all kinds of things in them for everybody and they buy off the votes.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>McCain continued with another call for increasing offshore drilling:</p> <blockquote> <p><br> Also, on oil drilling, oil drilling offshore now is vital so that we can bridge the gap. We can bridge the gap between imported oil, which is a national security issue, as well as any other, and it will reduce the price of a barrel of oil, because when people know there's a greater supply, then the cost of that will go down. That's fundamental economics. We've got to drill offshore, my friends, and we've got to do it now, and we can do it.</p> </blockquote> <p>The final debate, scheduled for Oct. 15, is intended to focus on domestic policy issues. If, as expected, the economy remains the dominant issue in the campaign, we may very well see McCain and Obama return again and again to energy issues. The question will be whether the moderator (CBS's Bob Schieffer) can get them to drop their talking points in favor of a deeper discussion about the scope of the climate problem and the significant changes Americans need to make in how they consume energy.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.ltmcollection.org/roundel/about/detailedhistory.html?IXpage=1&amp;_IXSESSION_=05n9o6nCe2B\">London Transport roundel</a> is one of the earliest, best, most familiar and enduring of all corporate logos. It's been around in one guise or another for exactly 100 years ago this autumn, when the various privately owned Underground railway companies decided to merge their identities for the convenience of the millions of passengers who travelled on their trains every day.</p> <p>The first roundel logo, known as the \"bullseye\" or \"target\", consisted of a solid red disc crossed, at its equator, with a blue bar on which the name of the station was written in somewhat clumsy white sans-serif lettering. Frank Pick [1878-1941], commercial and publicity manager of the London Underground Group of Companies knew that the symbol was a good one, but not good enough. He liked the contemporary YMCA logo, which used a triangle, voids and a crossbar, and began toying with his own designs for an improved \"bullseye\" and the lettering to go with it. A highly cultured businessman with the sharpest of eyes, Pick was, however, neither an artist nor a typographer. The problem was resolved when he was introduced to Edward Johnston [1872-1944], the brilliant arts and crafts calligrapher, who turned the 1908 \"bullseye\" into a strikingly handsome and wholly convincing symbol by 1917. </p> <p>Johnston worked on the design over a number of years, and had perfected its balance and proportions by the time the architect Charles Holden began incorporating it into the distinctive Underground stations he designed from the 1920s, including the brilliant <a href=\"http://arts.theguardian.com/greatbuildings/arnosgrove/0,,2183705,00.html\">Arnos Grove</a> and Southgate Piccadilly Line stations of the early 1930s. </p> <p>As for lettering, Johnston designed his superb sans-serif capitals for Pick between 1913 and 1916. This was eventually conjured into a typeface, and was to inspire such classic modern types as Gill Sans and many of the best German and Swiss designs of the 1920s and 30s.</p> <p>By the time Pick was managing director and chief executive of the London Passenger Transport Board, a public corporation formed in 1933 that brought pretty much all public transport operations in London under the umbrella of a single controlling organisation, the Johnston logo was truly ubiquitous. And the LPTB learned to relax. Artists designing posters and publicity material played creatively with the logo under Pick's benign direction. It might pop up as the wheels of a stylised bus, the head of a rushing commuter, a planet (as in <a href=\"http://www.ltmcollection.org/posters/poster/link.html?_IXMAXHITS_=1&amp;IXinv=1983/4/5186\">Man Ray's famous 1938 poster</a>) or even a flying saucer.</p> <p>The talented German graphic designer Hans Schleger [1898-1970] designed a simplified \"bullseye\" for a new generation of modern London Transport bus stops in 1935, while the proportions of the Johnston logo were significantly altered in 1972, by the Design Research Unit led by Misha Black, as part of a complete overhaul of London Transport's corporate identity. This is when the logo was named the roundel. </p> <p>Further changes were by Henrion, Ludlow and Schmidt in 1984, and a New Johnston typeface designed to accompany it. By this time, detailed guides laying down the law as to how and when to use company typefaces and logos were very much the norm across industries worldwide. Although polished, the sense of adventure and even fun nurtured by Frank Pick all those decades ago were beginning to be lost. So, it's good to see Art on the Underground commissioning <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/corporate/projectsandschemes/artmusicdesign/pfa/artists/liam-gillick-2008.asp\">100 contemporary artists</a> to make new works of art inspired by a century of the \"bullseye\" and \"roundel\". These will be on display at the <a href=\"http://www.afoundation.org.uk/rochelle/\">A Foundation Gallery</a> at the Rochelle School, Arnold Circus, London, from October 9-30 2008. A selection of the works will be mass-produced as posters for display throughout the Underground network. </p> <p>The roundel is a fine example of a logo or corporate symbol that has evolved over a long time while remaining one of the most effective, and popular, in use anywhere in the world today. The fact that it enters its second century in the spirit of creative art would have pleased its original creators no end. Pick wanted London's public transport system to be as much a work of civic art, and an inspiration everyone using it, as a quick, cheap and reliable method of getting from A to B - or, indeed, Amersham to Brixton.</p>",
  "<p>A teenager shot 11-year-old Rhys Jones by mistake while aiming at rival gang members across a pub car park, Liverpool crown court head today at the start of the trial into the schoolboy's murder.</p> <p>Sean Mercer, 18, allegedly a member of the Croxteth Crew gang, denies murdering Rhys, who the court heard was shot in the back with a Smith and Wesson .455 revolver.</p> <p>At one stage during the trial, Rhys's mother, Melanie Jones, left the court in tears as the prosecution began to describe her son's last moments. </p> <p>The jury was shown a CCTV clip of Rhys crossing the car park of the Fir Tree pub and reacting to the sound of a bullet striking a container nearby. He turned to look at the container before being hit by another bullet. The 11-year-old fell to the ground where he later died in his mother's arms.</p> <p>The prosecutor, Neil Flewitt, QC, told the jury that Rhys had ended up \"walking into the line of fire\" on his way home from football practice on August 22.</p> <p>\"At almost exactly the same time as Rhys Jones walked into the car park, a hooded gunman on a bicycle approached the scene from the rear of the Fir Tree and took up a position on the grass in front of the fence running alongside the path on the far side of the car park,\" he said.</p> <p>The gunman fired three shots across the car park, one of which hit Rhys, killing him. The gunman was Mercer, from Croxteth, Liverpool, said Flewitt.</p> <p>According to Home Office pathologist, Dr Paul Johnson, Rhys was shot in the back, slightly above the left shoulder blade and the bullet exited from the front right side of his neck. </p> <p>When paramedics arrived, Rhys was already in cardiac arrest and was rushed to Alder Hey children's hospital but all attempts to resuscitate Rhys failed. </p> <p>Immediately after killing Rhys, Mercer \"set about distancing himself from the tragic events at the pub.</p> <p>\"He moved quickly to dispose of his clothing, his pedal cycle and the gun that he had used to such devastating effect,\" he said.</p> <p>Rhys was not Mercer's intended victim, the prosecutor added. \"On the contrary, it is the prosecution case that he was the innocent victim of a long-running feud between rival gangs operating in and around the area of the Fir Tree public house.\"</p> <p>Six co-defendants - Boy M, 16, James Yates, 20, Boy Q, 17, Melvin Coy, 25, Gary Kays, 25, from Liverpool, and Boy K, 17 - are charged with assisting an offender. For legal reasons, some are not named. Yates is also accused of possessing a firearm, and Boy K faces charges of possessing two firearms and ammunition.</p> <p>When Mercer was arrested, he claimed he was at Boy K's house but the prosecution said they had evidence which contradicts this.</p> <p>Boy K's mother said when Mercer called at the house, she was sure they left while Emmerdale was showing, and her son returned about 30 minutes later. </p> <p>\"So if [her] recollection is correct, Sean Mercer had left her house before Rhys Jones was killed and she does not support his alibi for the time of the murder,\" Flewitt said.</p> <p>Police also installed a hidden listening device inside the home address of James Yates, which the prosecution alleges recorded various \"significant conversations\" that took place in the days that followed.</p> <p>All defendants deny all the charges. Flewitt said all were members or associates of the Croxteth Crew, which has a rival gang in Norris Green known as either the Strand Gang or Nogga Dogs. Since 2004, there had been at least 70 cases of criminal damage and assault including the use of firearms associated with both gangs, he said.</p> <p>Flewitt said that until Rhys's killing the best-known manifestation of this feud had been the murder of Liam Smith, a member of the Strand Gang, who was shot dead outside Altcourse prison on August 23 2006. Four members of the Croxteth Crew were convicted in connection with this \u2013 three of murder and one of manslaughter.</p> <p>On the day that Rhys was killed, three young men - Wayne Brady and two others - who were Strand Gang members or associates \"left the relative safety of Norris Green and entered what, for them, was the hostile environment of Croxteth\". </p> <p>They were in the area because Brady wanted to borrow a bicycle from a friend who lived nearby.</p> <p>Flewitt said their presence brought Mercer to the Fir Tree pub and he was shooting at them when he killed Rhys.</p> <p>\"Sean Mercer's interest in Wayne Brady was not limited to general gang rivalry,\" Flewitt said. \"Rather evidence suggests there was some more personal animosity between them.\"</p> <p>A witness told police she knew Mercer and had said to her: \"Brady's gonna get it.\"</p> <p>He described the murder of Rhys Jones as \"yet another, and perhaps more tragic, example of the mindless and indiscriminate violence that is a feature of the rivalry between the Croxteth Crew and the Strand Gang\".</p> <p>The activities of the Croxteth Crew not only provided the setting for the murder of Rhys Jones but also led to the involvement of the other defendants, Flewitt said.</p> <p>\"It is the prosecution's case that the strength of the loyalty that existed among gang members and their associates explains the speed and enthusiasm with which [the six defendants] did all that they could to help Sean Mercer avoid responsibility for the dreadful events,\" he said.</p> <p>Flewitt said everyone who heard or read about the circumstances of Rhys Jones's death was both shocked and saddened at the loss of such a young life. \"You will, no doubt, share the dismay of all decent people that such an appalling event could take place at a busy public house and in broad daylight.\"</p> <p>Flewitt said Rhys Jones was born on September 27 1995 and was 11 years old when he died. He lived with his parents and older brother near the pub. Rhys had just completed his final year at Broad Square junior school in Croxteth and was looking forward to going to secondary school.</p> <p>\"Like many boys of his age, Rhys Jones loved football. He supported Everton and played for the under 12 team at the Fir Tree pub.\"</p> <p>The trial continues. It is expected to take six to eight weeks.</p>",
  "<p>As I've said before, everyone following this election, wherever they are in the world, should check in at least occasionally with leading conservative blog <a href=\"http://corner.nationalreview.com/\">The Corner</a>, part of the National Review magazine, because there's something genuinely life-affirming about what's posted there. I promise I'm not being sarcastic, or not entirely: there's a kind of breathtaking wonder involved in the logical and rhetorical acrobatics indulged in by its contributors. Their latest argument: that Barack Obama is a deeply suspicious, foreignish type of individual because he <a href=\"http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OGM1ZGYyYWU5ZTZiMWVjZjdmZTZkZjk2N2MyZjZhOTA=\">pronounces Pakistan with a soft \"a\" sound</a>, or in what Mark Steyn calls an \"ostentatiously exotic\" way, whereas Sarah Palin is a real American because she <a href=\"http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OTNkMDVjNjA4ODJkYjViZDMxMzg1OWU0ZjM2MDExMTE=\">pronounces Iraq wrongly</a>. As Adam Serwer <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/tapped_archive?month=10&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=\" how_sarah_palin_is_like_50_cen\" \">says</a>: \"Keep in mind that these are the same people who insist that a culture of ignorance holds black people back, while lauding Sarah Palin's vast ignorance of public policy as some kind of tremendous virtue. They demand merit from others and only mediocrity from themselves, because said mediocrity is touted as proof of authenticity.\" </p> <p>Oh, and actually \"Pahhkistan\" is <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/10/08/obama-pakistan/\">how General David Petraeus pronounces it too</a>, but everyone already knows how much he hates America.</p>",
  "<p>You can't switch on the TV without seeing slick-looking politicians, and Gordon Brown. If it's not a party conference, it's a crisis. If it's not a speech, it's an interview. Men and women in suits try and get us to vote for them, give money to them, trust them, or all three at the same time. But what would happen if you behaved like a politician at work? </p> <p>The methods Brown and Cameron and Obama and McCain use are designed to get their messages heard and paint a positive picture of one view and a negative image of another.</p> <p>This is clearly the very definition of a transferable skill. It can be applied in interviews, promotions, meetings and even everyday interactions. You could probably even use political speak to justify control of the TV remote - who could resist a Martin Luther King quote in a passionate case for The Simpsons rather than the news?</p> <p>So next time your boss asks a question that flummoxes you at work, perhaps you could use the same tactic. Try an age-old politician's technique and say: \"That's not really the issue, what's more important is ... \" before going off into something unrelated that makes you look better. Like how nice your shoes are. If that doesn't work, try the John McCain method of question answering, which is to stretch the truth into a fiction that even a quick Google search would expose, but trust that your boss hasn't got time to do so and must take your word for it.</p> <p>Failing that you could pretend you haven't heard, then wave at them happily as many politicians do when getting on to planes. If they insist on an answer read a prepared statement on the topic and refuse to take any questions. Perhaps even direct them to a spokesperson who can look harassed and continually repeat a line denying that the report hasn't been finished, and promising to look into its whereabouts in the fullness of time. </p> <p>The problem is that in any world outside of the sound bite and spin culture of Westminster or Capitol Hill, you'd last about five minutes. Your colleagues would just shout at you and demand actual work rather than photographs of you with disadvantaged children distributed around the building. But there is one shining example to all of us, and that comes from the American election. </p> <p>We've all felt like Sarah Palin at some time: that growing realisation you are out of your depth in a new job, but can't tell anyone because it's gone too far. She'd doubtless always dreamed of getting to the top in American politics. But going from being mayor of a town with less than 10,000 inhabitants to being the governor of an isolated state with roughly the population of Leeds, she must have dismissed these dreams as unrealistic. Just like you or I might dismiss fantasies about Nobel prizes for literature or running a record label. </p> <p>So when the call came in asking her to become vice-presidential candidate she leapt at the opportunity. She thought it would be fine to answer questions on foreign policy and complex economics. And like any of us in a similar position - whether in accountancy, PR or tree surgery - it's too late for her to tell anyone the truth and she must now brazen it out. </p> <p>The lesson to be learnt here is that it is often best to 'fess up and admit your shortcomings. Maybe if she'd mentioned that she doesn't read any newspapers and only got a passport last year they'd have trained her better. So if you're reading this, and someone has just asked you to do something you have no idea how to do, but probably should, for goodness sake ask someone. Or risk being relegated to Alaska forever more.</p>",
  "<p>Tuesday's <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/washington/08detain.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin\">ruling</a> by a US district court judge in Washington <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/1008/p99s01-duts.html\">ordering 17 Uighurs released into the US</a> brings us one step closer to righting one of the most egregious wrongs in the catalogue of injustices at Guant\u00e1namo.</p> <p>The right thing to do about the Guant\u00e1namo Uighurs has been staring the Bush administration in the face for years, but they lacked the courage to do it on their own. They knew very quickly that these men posed no threat to the US, but that they could not be sent back to China, and no country was willing to risk relations with Beijing to solve America's problem. The only viable option was to resettle them in the US, but the Bush administration refused, perhaps hoping to run out the clock and leave this problem for the next administration. So the Uighurs languished at Guant\u00e1namo until Tuesday, no longer enemy combatants, just prisoners of cowardice.</p> <p>The Uighurs are a Muslim ethnic minority group residing in western China that has at times resisted the control of the Chinese communist party in Beijing. The Chinese government has a history of <a href=\"http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20020701facomment8515/chien-peng-chung/china-s-war-on-terror-september-11-and-uighur-separatism.html\">persecuting Uighurs</a>, and many have fled across the border to camps in Afghanistan. Some of them then had to flee again after the US invasion in October 2001 and ended up in Pakistan, where they were taken in by bounty hunters and turned over to US forces, <a href=\"http://hrw.org/reports/2008/us0608/4.htm#_Toc200538881\">ultimately arriving at Guant\u00e1namo</a> in June 2002. </p> <p>At Guant\u00e1namo, after Chinese officials interrogated the Uighurs, the Bush administration alleged the Afghan camp at which they were living was run by a member of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), which was further alleged to be associated with al-Qaida. Each of the Uighurs adamantly denies any connection to ETIM, and while some admit that they wanted to return to their homeland to defend their fellow Uighurs against the \"Chinese occupiers\", as they describe them, most appeared to be in the camp waiting for the chance to travel further west, hoping for political asylum in Turkey or Iran. US courts have repeatedly held that even if the connection to ETIM was absolutely true, it would not be sufficient grounds to detain the Uighurs.</p> <p>So the case of the Uighurs is simultaneously simple and complex. Simple because all sides agree that they are not enemies of the US. Complex because all sides agree that the Chinese government views them as enemies. The Bush administration cleared some of the Uighurs for release as long ago as 2003. The Chinese have demanded their return, but international and domestic law prohibits the Bush administration from sending them to a fate of torture or worse. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/10/world/europe/10resettle.html\">Albania accepted five of the Guant\u00e1namo Uighurs</a> in 2006, but as Beijing has ratcheted up the pressure on it and other countries, no other nation has agreed to accept any Uighurs out of fear of repercussions in their relations with China. </p> <p>The obvious solution was to bring them into the US, but the Bush administration clung to the flimsy excuse that it could not allow immigrants into the US with connections to terrorist organisations, despite however tenuous the connection to ETIM. The real reason for the Bush administration's reticence is clear: they too were afraid of the wrath of China and perhaps conservative ideologues unwilling to accept that mistakes were made at Guant\u00e1namo. And so the Uighurs sat at Guant\u00e1namo, until now. </p> <p>US district judge Ricardo Urbina ordered the 17 remaining Guant\u00e1namo Uighurs brought to his courtroom on Friday and released into the <a href=\"http://news.google.co.uk/news/url?sa=t&amp;ct=:ePkh8BM9EwLbwQq0w4ANYgubEFNqjgEr3LZUuJW5MIuMBGYEO1-cw6VxNfLir84KK517v9iAmgDP6RGe/0-0&amp;fp=48ed1efa97a96cf6&amp;ei=9CDtSJjDF5rUQbXnxIIJ&amp;url=http%3A//www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/07/AR2008100702685.html&amp;cid=1255094094&amp;usg=AFQjCNEND6B_s_0N1EX9KisaU4WwoWvCFQ\">Washington-area Uighur community</a>, but <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKTRE497C0T20081009\">an appeals court granted a temporary stay</a> of the decision until October 16. The stay is a setback for the Uighurs, but the US government is unlikely to prevail on appeal, because Urbinia's decision really was the only one possible. These men are not enemy combatants, meaning the government has no grounds to detain them, and years of failed efforts to find another home meant the only realistic possibility for timely release was in the US. Urbina warned the government against its threatened action to re-arrest the Uighurs on immigration charges upon their eventual release. Hopefully, someone in the Bush administration has an ounce of decency left and the sense to avoid a tragic replay of this sorry episode of indefinite detention and injustice. </p> <p>Urbina's decision continues the trajectory of Guant\u00e1namo toward inevitable closure. Waiting until it is forced to release the Uighurs merely underscores the Bush administration's lack of courage to make the difficult questions necessary to close the prison. The greatest tragedy in this saga is that it was this cowardice that cost the Uighurs years of their lives.</p>",
  "<p>Plans to expand Britain's biggest budget airline hub, Stansted airport, were embroiled in a funding row today after its biggest customers threatened to pull more flights.</p> <p>Britain's biggest budget airline hub received the go-ahead to handle 10 million more passengers but was warned by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/ryanair\">Ryanair</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/easyjet\">easyJet</a> that it faces fewer flights if it hikes fees to pay for the expansion.</p> <p>The government rubber-stamped a proposal to lift the passenger cap at the Essex airport from 25 million per year to 35 million, which allows around 120 more daily flights. However, Stansted's biggest customers are withdrawing planes from the airport this winter in a row over landing fees and are threatening to pull more services if the expansion increases costs further.</p> <p>Ryanair and easyJet, who operate seven out of ten flights at the airport, have warned that it would add \u00a3550m to the overall cost of the airport, which will have to be paid off by higher landing fees.</p> <p>\"It could mean less flights. If <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/baa\">BAA</a> goes ahead and adds \u00a3550m on the value of the airport and further increases its charges, both airlines will take out capacity,\" said an easyJet spokesman. More than 23 million passengers used Stansted last year, but passenger numbers have dropped 4% since January, leading some analysts to doubt whether the 35 million limit will be reached any time soon.</p> <p>BAA, Stansted's owner, said Ryanair and easyJet were \"jumping the gun\" ahead of a regulatory inquiry that will set landing fees. </p> <p>Jim Fitzpatrick, the aviation minister, said overcrowding at London airports was a key factor in the decision. \"There is an urgent need for additional runway capacity in the south east,\" he said. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/aviation/airports/decisionletters/stansted/\">Officials at the departments of Transport and Local Government admitted</a> that there may be \"some negative health effects due to changes in levels of air pollution\" but added that they would be small.</p> <p>Shadow transport secretary Theresa Villiers backed the decision to allow more passengers on Stansted's only runway but warned that Conservatives would \"strongly oppose\" a second. </p> <p>Tim Yeo, the Conservative chairman of the all-party Environmental Audit Committee, said the move would stoke a boom in cheap air travel. </p> <p>\"It is the wrong decision. It is a bad decision environmentally for East Anglia and it is also wrong economically because the expansion of Stansted has depended on low-cost flights and the expansion of that type of flying.\" </p> <p>Campaign group Stop Stansted Expansion, which has led opposition to development of the airport, said the decision was \"entirely predictable, cynical and unjustified\". </p> <p>\"Given the government's gung-ho approach to airport expansion, we always knew that the dice were loaded in favour of BAA,\" said SSE chairman Peter Sanders. </p> <p>The announcement came as expansion plans for City Airport, London's fourth largest airport, also received approval. The Docklands-based airport was given planning permission to increase flights by 50%, from 80,000 to 120,000 per year. </p> <p>Passenger numbers are expected to reach 3.2 million next year, although the downturn in the financial services industry is expected to reduce demand at an airport whose proximity to Canary Wharf and the Square Mile makes it popular with business passengers.</p>",
  "<p>Invest in spade manufacturers. That's my hot tip for those of you looking for a punt during these uncertain times. For this is surely a wonderful time to be burying bad news.</p> <p>There was certainly something of the <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/byers/page/0,11320,630499,00.html\">Jo Moore's</a> about today's announcement by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/03/geoffhoon.labour\">Geoff Hoon</a>, the fresh-off-the-carousel transport secretary, that Stansted airport is to be given the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/09/baa.theairlineindustry\">go-ahead to expand</a> its passenger capacity. Would he have dared do so at any other time given that it was just 72 hours ago that the government's <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/uk/legislation/committee/index.htm\">committee on climate change</a>, chaired by Lord Turner (some week he's having what with his other job at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/may/30/alistairdarling.economy\">FSA</a>), said that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/07/carbon.emissions.targets\">UK's carbon reduction target for 2050</a> should be raised from 60% to 80% and include shipping and aviation?</p> <p>Airport expansion seems to make about as much sense this week as looking for good savings deals in Iceland. Even if you put climate change concerns aside \u2013 a near-impossible ask when it comes to airports, I admit \u2013 then airport expansion still seems to be a dud. With airlines going out of business by the week due to high fuel costs, and consumers pulling up the drawbridge on their spending (which, presumably, will curtail the urge to pop to Europe by plane for the weekend), the <a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/aviation/atf/\">growth predictions</a> made by the aviation industry \u2013 and lapped up by the present government \u2013 now seem to be more than a little wide of the mark. The current economic situation is actually presenting the government with the perfect opportunity to gracefully retreat from its unpopular and unwise airport expansion plans \u2013 and yet it pushes on like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jul/01/topstories3.military\">Douglas Haig at the Somme</a>. The plans for Stansted and Heathrow's third runway should really be dead in the water by now \u2013 for example, how and with whom is <a href=\"http://www.baa.com/\">BAA</a> now going to raise the funds for these projects? \u2013 but still they refuse to whither. I wonder if <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/03/climatechange.energy\">Ed Miliband</a>, as the new secretary of state for climate change and energy, was even involved in the decision. To be honest, it tells us much about the government's true convictions on climate change whether he was or he wasn't involved.</p> <p>My bet is that the third runway at Heathrow really must now be a lost cause for its ever-dwindling number of supporters. The tide has now almost fully turned against it \u2013 the politics, the economics, the environment. Stansted's expansion is very different because it doesn't require new asphalt to be laid, just an increase in the number of flights using its current runway. But never content, its owner BAA still pushes on with its predict-and-provide pleas for a second runway. If any good is to come out of the turbulence of recent weeks it will be that such plans will now have to make an urgent forced landing.</p>",
  "<p>Zimbabwe's official inflation rate has surged to 231,000,000% as the opposition appealed to South Africa's former president, Thabo Mbeki, to rescue the historic power-sharing deal he brokered last month. </p> <p>With the economy continuing its rapid collapse and no end in sight to the political deadlock, the World Food Programme today launched an appeal to feed 5 million Zimbabweans. It said that more than 80% of the country's population was living on less than \u00a31 a day and nearly half is chronically malnourished.</p> <p>The latest official inflation rate, for July, is twenty times higher than a month earlier. Independent economists, who have accurately estimated the true rate in the past, say that inflation this month will run into the trillions.</p> <p>That has forced the government to allow shops this week to begin accepting US dollars and South African rand because the Zimbabwean dollar is now all but worthless.</p> <p>The latest inflation figures will increase pressure on the country's president, Robert Mugabe to stop stalling over the composition of a new power-sharing government with the prime minister designate, Morgan Tsvangirai. The president is demanding security ministries such as the army and police as well as the finance portfolio even though foreign donors have made it clear that there will be no aid to revive the economy unless that falls under Tsvangirai's control.</p> <p>Tsvangirai said today that the talks were deadlocked and called for Mbeki to intervene. \"We have asked him to come over and he has said he will come over,\" he said.</p> <p>But Tsvangirai said he retained confidence in the agreement. \"We are confident about the potential of the deal,\" he said. \"In the process of implementation, we have hit an impasse but not on fundamental contents of the deal.</p> <p>\"Unfortunately no progress has been made ... to bring the Zimbabwean people to the beginning of the path of recovery. Instead the economic crisis has worsened. We now live in an environment characterised by hunger, starvation, and we are days away from seeing people dropping dead on the streets.\"</p> <p>Mugabe only signed what he called a \"humiliating\" agreement surrendering many of his powers because his government has no solution to the problems afflicting Zimbabwe, and that has not changed.</p> <p>Its attempt to curb inflation with enforced price reductions only drove trade on to the black market.</p> <p>The central bank removed 10 zeros from the national currency in August after rapid devaluation forced it to print Z$100bn notes that were worth only about 8p on the street when they were scrapped.</p> <p>But the new currency continued the free fall as it dropped from about Z$100 to the pound two months ago to Z$2m to the pound before the government blocked electronic bank transfers last week.</p> <p>Severe cash shortages, because the government cannot afford to print bank notes to keep pace with inflation, had meant that many people could at least use bank accounts as a means of payment using a parallel market rate. But that lifeline has now been cut.</p> <p>The central bank said the transfers were used for illicit exchange deals and to overprice goods. \"We have no option but to take this drastic measure in order to maintain sanity in the financial system,\" said the central bank governor, Gideon Gono.</p>",
  "<p>User Account Control (UAC) added greatly to the security of Windows Vista, but some people -- and plenty of vocal geeks -- have found it annoying. Microsoft security expert Ben Fathi has now explained the background and outlined the company's thinking on the <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2008/10/08/user-account-control.aspx\">Windows 7 Engineering blog</a>. He says: \"we will also address the overwhelming feedback that the user experience must improve.\"</p> <blockquote> <p>We've heard loud and clear that you are frustrated. You find the prompts too frequent, annoying, and confusing. </p> </blockquote> <p><br><br>According to Fathi, there has been a notable benefit to the Windows infrastructure. He says there were 775,312 unique applications producing prompts, mainly because \"much of the software ecosystem unnecessarily required admin privileges to run. As the ecosystem has updated their software, far fewer applications are requiring admin privileges. Customer Experience Improvement Program data from August 2008 indicates the number of applications and tasks generating a prompt has declined from 775,312 to 168,149.\"</p> <p>This reduction has made Microsoft look worse. As he admits: \"Windows components accounted for 17 of the top 50 UAC prompts in Vista and 29 of the top 50 in Vista SP1.\"</p> <p>With SP1, users get an average of one prompt every three days.</p> <p>For the future, Fathi says:</p> <blockquote> <p>We still want to provide you control over what changes can happen to your system, but we want to provide you a better overall experience. We believe this can be achieved by focusing on two key principles. 1) Broaden the control you have over the UAC notifications. We will continue to give you control over the changes made to your system, but in Windows 7, we will also provide options such that when you use the system as an administrator you can determine the range of notifications that you receive. 2) Provide additional and more relevant information in the user interface. We will improve the dialog UI so that you can better understand and make more informed choices. We've already run new design concepts based on this principle through our in-house usability testing and we've seen very positive results. 83% of participants could provide specific details about why they were seeing the dialog.

  "<p>A degree of calm returned to the world's stockmarkets today following yesterday's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.marketturmoil1\">coordinated global rate cut</a>.</p> <p>In London, the FTSE 100 jumped more than 3% at one stage this morning to a high of 4512, up 145 points, and was up 82 points mid-afternoon. Banks continued to recover following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.marketturmoil1\">the UK goverment's \u00a3500bn rescue plan</a> announced yesterday, with shares in HBOS up 35% and Royal Bank of Scotland 15% higher.</p> <p>Wall Street staged a rally after yesterday's 2% fall of the Dow Jones industrial average. The Dow rose 154 points to 9412 points in early trading, a gain of 1.6%. The US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, signalled last night that the government could invest in banks to help restore confidence in the sector.</p> <p>\"There's a little bit of calm after what's been a very volatile week so far,\" said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec. \"There's some realisation that world governments are serious about tackling the problems they find in front of them.\" But he added: \"We're unlikely to be entering a stable period; there's still a lot of nerves in markets.\"</p> <p>But the banks were still reluctant to lend to each other despite yesterday's half-point reduction in the Bank of England's base rate to 4.5%. Three-month sterling Libor - the rate which banks charge each other for short-term loans - rose to 6.28% this morning from 6.27% yesterday, with other indicators showing that financial firms are still hoarding cash.</p> <p>The financial crisis continued to ripple across Europe this morning. All share trading in Iceland was suspended. Iceland, which has been hit hard by the financial crisis, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/09/banking.iceland\">took control of the country's biggest bank Kaupthing</a>. Iceland has now brought most of its banking sector under state control. Kaupthing's board has resigned.</p> <p>European stocks recovered from heavy losses in recent days, with Germany's Dax rising 1.5% and France's CAC 40 up 2.6% this afternoon. Troubled financial group Dexia jumped 25% after France, Belgium and Luxembourg announced they had agreed to provide state guarantees to help it borrow.</p> <p>Speaking after the concerted interest rate cuts announced yesterday by the world's major central banks, Paulson appeared to suggest that the US treasury may follow the UK's lead by taking stakes in many US banks.</p> <p>\"We will use all of the tools we've been given to maximum effectiveness, including strengthening the capitalisation of financial institutions of every size,\" he told a news conference.</p> <p>Striking a cautious tone that sent shares sliding on Wall Street last night, Paulson cautioned the US rescue plan will not save all firms. \"One thing we must recognise - even with the new treasury authorities, some financial institutions will fail,\" he said, adding that regulators will take measures to limit the systemic risk from any single bank failure.</p> <p>Asian central banks have now joined in yesterday's unprecedented global rate cut. South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan all lowered their benchmark interest rates by a quarter point overnight. This followed half-point cuts from the Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and other European central banks. </p> <p>Asian stockmarkets were mixed overnight, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng rising 3.3% and shares in Seoul up 0.6%, while Taiwan's index dropped 1.45%.</p> <p>The Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, said his government was prepared to buy stakes in failing banks while waiving voting rights. Italy has been largely shielded from the global financial turmoil because its banking sector is mostly retail, relying on savers' deposits rather than money markets. </p> <p>Germany may have to consider nationalising its banks if the crisis continues to worsen, finance minister Peer Steinbrueck told a newspaper. </p> <p>\"Just lowering interest rates would be far from sufficient in the current situation,\" said Amar Gill at CLSA in Singapore. \"The main problem now is that banks are not lending to weaker banks, and the overall banking system is not lending to corporates.\" </p> <p>The Bank of Japan did not take part in the coordinated rate cuts as its interest rates are already near zero, but the country's finance minister, Shoichi Nakagawa, welcomed the move.

  "<p>The new children's minister, Baroness Delyth Morgan, has proposed that all schools are judged on their contribution to the wellbeing of pupils.</p> <p>Morgan launched a <a href=\"http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/consultations/\">consultation</a> today on a proposed set of indicators to \"recognise and reward\" schools for their efforts towards pupils' wellbeing.</p> <p>The consultation is part of government aims, set out in the Children's Plan, for schools to play a key role in the wider development of young people, not just their education.</p> <p>The government's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/apr/30/schools.uk\">original proposals</a>, revealed by the Guardian in April, were described as \"madness\" by teachers' leaders.</p> <p>They cautiously welcomed today's consultation, but warned that the proposed measures posed \"grave danger\".</p> <p>The consultation outlines a standardised set of indicators to be used by schools themselves, and by Ofsted, in evaluating the contribution being made to the wellbeing of its pupils.</p> <p>These include quantitative data already available, such as the school's overall attendance rate and the take-up of school lunches, as well as pupil and parent perceptions about how well the school promotes wellbeing.</p> <p>Pupils and parents will be asked, for example, whether the school encourages physical activity, whether pupils feel safe at school, and whether the school deals effectively with bullying.</p> <p>Under the proposals, data obtained using the indicators will take account of the area in which schools are located and the contribution made by other services.</p> <p>And schools will not be held to account for outcomes over which they have little or no influence - such as levels of obesity or teenage pregnancy rates.</p> <p>The indicators could be used by Ofsted in its school inspection arrangements from 2009.</p> <p>Morgan said: \"In the Children's Plan we outlined our vision that the 21st-century school can play a key role in promoting the wellbeing of children, and work with parents to give children the support they need to learn and succeed in life.</p> <p>\"We know that good schools are already doing this and that headteachers want more help to achieve the best outcomes for all their pupils.<br> \"School-level indicators will help schools to assess how well they are promoting the wellbeing of their pupils.\"</p> <p>She insisted that the indicators would not place an \"extra burden\" on schools as they already collect most of the information.</p> <p>\"They will build on data about pupils' attainment and progress, so that wider aspects of children's lives can be benchmarked nationally,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Schools can use this information to self-assess and improve the care they provide children and young people.\"</p> <p>The chief schools inspector, Christine Gilbert, said the indicators would help schools' self-evaluate, and improve the quality of education and care they provide.</p> <p>\"The indicators will also provide useful evidence for Ofsted inspectors, to be used alongside other evidence when investigating the wellbeing of children and young people and the school's contribution to it,\" she added.</p> <p>Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said: \"This proposal has a balanced view of the role schools play in promoting pupil wellbeing, as it recognises that families should have prime responsibility, and both local authorities and health services also have major roles.</p> <p>\"But regrettably, the proposal is bedevilled by the government's obsession with data.</p> <p>\"Ministers have readily accepted that important aspects of pupil wellbeing cannot be quantified, but in the next breath they demand statistics.</p> <p>\"We see grave dangers in the proposal for Ofsted inspections to take into account pupil and parent opinion surveys of how successfully a school is promoting pupil wellbeing, because perceptions are notoriously difficult to interpret.</p> <p>\"While many schools already use opinion surveys, they know they must take great care in interpreting the results.\"</p> <p>Dr John Dunford, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \"When wellbeing indicators were first discussed, the ASCL was extremely worried that schools would be held to account for matters well beyond their control, such as the number of obese children on their roll.</p> <p>\"This consultation document has moved a very long way from that, and puts forward a scheme that has the potential to give greater recognition to the contribution made by schools to the wider development of the child.</p> <p>\"Currently school accountability is almost entirely focused on examination results. Yet schools put a huge amount of effort into the wider development of young people.</p> <p>\"Numerical indicators, including those in the consultation document, give a very limited picture of pupil wellbeing and it is good that the DCSF has recognised this.</p> <p>\"Similarly, the DCSF has rightly acknowledged that responsibility, and therefore accountability, for wellbeing needs to be shared between the local authority, individual schools and parents.</p> <p>\"The consultation makes clear that these wellbeing indicators will not be used to dictate or determine school inspection judgements.\"</p> <p>Some of the quantitative indicators were \"blunt instruments\", he warned, but the proposals were a \"more intelligent means of accountability than might have been the case\".</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> London. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Olly Dixon (machines, samples, electronic percussion, guitars), Tim Lawton (machines, Moog, vocals), Mark Ralph (machines, bass, guitar, backing vocals).<br> <strong>The background:</strong> Like the Chemical Brothers, Filthy Dukes started life as backroom boys and studio technicians, promoting club nights and doing DJ sets as well as the occasional remix, before becoming proper musicians and forming a band when Olly Dixon and Tim Lawton joined forces with their long-term producer Mark Ralph. Soon, they began writing their own material and performing it live, like bands tend to do. Like the Beach Boys they've been around: Dixon and Lawton have long been faces on the London club scene (although they don't have particularly long faces). With their electroacidhousenuravetwisteddiscopunkfunk DJ sets they've supported Mylo, Hot Chip and LCD Soundsystem. They've hosted free warehouse raves, boat parties on the Thames, co-promoted London's Adventures in the Beetroot Field and played most of the summer festivals. They've remixed the Maccabees, the Rakes and more. And their Kill Em All night is a rock-rave standby, filling Fabric every month with DJs and new bands. Bloc Party, Justice, Shy Child: they all got their first exposure at KEA, and you can detect some of their influence on Filthy Dukes' sound, as well as traces of Chemical Brothers, Justice, Daft Punk and Kraftwerk. <br> As much as anything, though, the Dukes recall good old-fashioned 80s synth-pop, only with added low-end bass whomp. Tracks like Elevator and What Happens Next sound like Depeche Mode or Soft Cell circa Memorabilia only with Bootsy Collins on bass, while This Rhythm could be Heaven 17 with a chattering acid house sequencer. Filthy Dukes insist they're as much about hooks and choruses as they are about providing beats for clubbers to mong out to. \"We want to make poppy songs, not just gnarly dance songs,\" they say. They've spent the last year writing songs and performing them live, honing the music that will appear on their debut album, Nonsense in the Dark. It was recorded on krautrock legend Conny Plank's original mixing desk and features star turns from numerous former New Bands of the Day types such as Orlando Weeks from the Maccabees, frYars, Sam Dust from Late of the Pier and Philly wacky rappers Plastic Little. The latter appear on Tupac Robot Club Rock, the first single from the album, and give the massive rampaging monster of an electro riff a comical tickle, with its literate entreaties to \"push that rock like Sisyphus\" alongside admonishments for pissing in the sink and rhyming references to leprechauns, terrorists and Aerosmith. Expect more such rap dementia when Plastic Little join Filthy Dukes for their Kill Em All tour this month alongside Metronomy and those other veterans of the New Band of the Day wars, Midnight Juggernauts.  <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"They're the rising stars of electro-pop.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> We'd like to hear a whole album of proper electronic pop tunes from FD, less excited about just another collection of riffs and rhythms. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Put Tupac's lawyers on standby.<br> <strong>Least likely to: </strong>Impact on Biggie Smalls's estate. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Debut single Tupac Robot Club Rock is released on November 3 by Fiction, followed early next year by the album Nonsense in the Dark.<br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Boys Noize, Justice, Metronomy, Shy Child. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/filthydukes\">www.myspace.com/filthydukes</a> </p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Stonefoxx. </p>",

So were he still with us, he'd be unimpressed to learn that National Debt Clock has now run out of room.</p> <p>The ballooning US national debt has now broken through the $10 trillion mark to reach $10,299.299,050,383 at the time of typing.

  "<p>You think Cubs fans feel bad? They lost A division series, I lost EACH division series. At least those Cubbies are lovable losers; I'm just a loser. That's four playoff predictions and zero wins. ZERO, sometimes referred to as zilch or nada. Heck, last season I got one of four division series predictions correct. In 2008 it's the big fat doughnut, and the teams I backed went 3-12. Why? I'm addicted to underdogs. I can hear Mr Winwood snickering <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ianwinwood\">over at the guardian.co.uk NHL blog</a> - Red Wings to win the Stanley Cup, Ian? You're really putting your arse on the line with that tip \u2026 let's see how smart you look in June. </p> <p>I never did like this prediction stuff, probably because I suck at it. Haven't I written this before? So, where to from here? Maybe I should retire, move to Florida, get on a low-salt diet and play shuffleboard? It's a tempting option, but then there's a chance I may run into a Rays fan, and I couldn't take the shame. Better perhaps to end this little pity party and have another crack at making a tit of myself. So here goes nothing, and really, it's nothing. </p> <h2>National League</h2> <p>Let's start off with a question for Cubs fans. Is it better to win the National League Central Division by 7.5 games, head into the post-season with a team more than capable of snapping their 100-year title drought, only to be torched in three straight games in the first round? Or, would you prefer a relaxing, expectation free summer, inside the friendly confines of Wrigley Field, drinking beers and listening to the old organ while finishing in third or fourth place? </p> <p>After this latest embarrassment, Chicago Cubs fans may begin to understand that their team is not supposed to win the World Series, and shouldn't win the World Series. Their team is about one thing, and that's being the curators of baseball's living baseball museum, Wrigley Field, which plays host to regular displays of the game in a grand ol' setting. For me, that is something to be proud of, and I urge you to embrace it, and forget about winning. Get over it Cubs fans, keep the dream the dream - if you win, you'll run the risk of becoming the Red Sox, and that sucks.</p> <p>It was Joe Torre's Los Angeles Dodgers, back in the National League Championship Series for the first time since 1988, who conquered the Cubs as easy as 1-2-3, a total which happens to add up to the number of runs Chicago scored in three lifeless defeats. The Cubs had scored more than any other team in the NL during the regular season, but against the Dodgers' complete pitching staff, Chicago's bats looked frail and weak. In a short, best-of-five game series, LA proved again that getting past a top pitching staff is difficult, even when armed with a dangerous line-up. The Cubs pitching, excellent, but not quite up to par with that of the Dodgers, underperformed and were roughed up by a streaking LA offense, or, more specifically, by Manny Ramirez, who is carrying the Dodgers on his back, hitting balls off the ground and into the bleachers. Many baseball fans are starting to drool over the prospect of Manny returning to Boston (not to mention other key ex-Sox Derek Lowe and Nomar Garciaparra) for all the marbles. </p> <p>There's plenty to do before that dream match-up can be realised, and a formidable NLCS opponent in manager Charlie Manuel's Phillies, who handled the Milwaukee Brewers relatively easily. Philadelphia is never fun for visitors, especially because their fans are complete and total animals. Other than that x-factor, the Dodgers match up well with Philadelphia, who are back in the NLCS for the first time in 15 years. The Phils starters have snapped into form, boosted by a solid start from the inconsistent Joe Blanton in Game Four v Milwaukee. Their bullpen, like LA's, is strong, and anchored by their closer, Brad Lidge, who has struggled in post-seasons past, but hasn't blown a save opportunity all season long. If there's a slight edge in this series, it belongs to the Phillies, who feature a pair of left-handed sluggers in Chase Utley and Ryan Howard. The Dodgers have just one left-handed starter, Clayton Kershaw, to counter those power sticks, and he hasn't pitched in 11 days. That should help the powerful pair emerge from a combined 4-25 playoff slump. The Phillies also have home-field advantage in their tiny Citizens Bank Park, an intimidating place for all pitchers, but especially to visiting hurlers. </p> <p>Both teams are scorching; the Dodgers are 22-8 in their last 30 games, while the Phils are 22-9, in a similar stretch. Doesn't this look like a series that has seven games written all over it? </p> <p><strong>Prediction time:</strong> Bet against Manny again? Hell no - Dodgers in seven. </p> <h2>American League</h2> <p>In the American League, the Eastern Division is once again heavily represented in the Championship Series, so let's check in with the Yankees manager Joe Girardi for an update.</p> <p>Hey Joe, what are your plans for the pitching rotation? Who will DH? Johnny Damon? What's that Joe? You're not playing? The Yankees didn't make the playoffs? Tampa Bay! Golf? What? </p> <p>Yes, it's true. Yankees haters are living out their October fantasies - there are no Bronx Bombers in the post-season, that is, unless you count Joe Torre, the Dodgers manager, who according to Yankees management was more of a custodian figure than a major piece to their championship puzzle during a dominating 12-year run. The brass in the Bronx, most notably Hank Steinbrenner, must be seething at the moment, and not just because the old Joe could land back in the Fall Classic while the Yanks sit on the sidelines. New York icon Don Mattingly is Torre's bench coach, while Tampa Bay, an organisation that Hank's daddy and team owner George Steinbrenner despises, prepares to face Boston, the Yankees chief rivals. Yankee haters couldn't have drawn it up much better than this. </p> <p>One major New York sports radio personality said that the playoffs would be missing a buzz without the Bombers - he couldn't be more wrong. This ALCS will be full of fireworks, featuring two franchises with a history of brawls between them, the latest coming in June when eight players were suspended as a result. Tampa Bay are considered slight underdogs here, mostly because they are less than household names and their opponents are defending World Series champs. Even if Boston have more of a star-studded group, you can't underestimate Tampa after they won a division title, a tight season series over the Bosox, and their 100th game, against the Windy City's other ousted team, the White Sox, in the ALDS.</p> <p>In that season series against Terry Francona's Red Sox, the home team won all but three of 18 contests, but Tampa won two of those games when the chips were down in September. With the Rays' shrinking lead down to just a half game, and the baseball world awaiting their collapse, Boston were dropped twice by Tampa in games packed with post-season type drama. Joe Maddon's resilient Rays left town with the division lead, knowing they could win in a big spot up at Fenway Park.</p> <p>Yes, the Red Sox have the playoff resume, but these Rays, a club with the lowest payroll in the AL, don't seem to care much about what happened in past seasons, as evidenced by their worst to first turnaround in 2008. They may be catching Boston at the right time - they're missing their third baseman, Mike Lowell, who is out of the ALCS with a hip injury, while ace Josh Beckett is not quite his usual dominating self, fighting a strained muscle.</p> <p>The Rays have a slight pitching edge, which comes into play mostly with their bullpen, nearly a half-run better than Boston's when in comes to ERA. Both teams can manufacture runs, a necessity in playoff baseball when facing top pitching, but overall offensively, Boston is a beast, while Tampa Bay are in the lower half of the AL in run production. With both clubs dominating at home, it may come down to who has the extra game if front of their fans - the decider would be played indoors at Tropicana Field.</p> <p><strong>Prediction time:</strong> Too much too soon for Tampa. Sox in six.</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday was another strange day in the election race: the latest developments in the global financial crisis once again rendered the battle between the candidates very much a secondary story. But the day after the debate in Nashville - awarded to Barack Obama by voters and pundits alike - both men and their running-mates were campaigning hard: Obama to consolidate his lead in the polls, and John McCain, despite the defeated noises coming from many conservative commentators, to devise a strategy for a comeback.</p> <p>What that comeback might involve didn't seem at all clear, though. Rather than going unremittingly negative, McCain's advisers were seeking to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/09/uselections2008.johnmccain\">refocus the campaign</a> on a narrow field of battleground states, suggesting a best-case scenario for the Republicans of a very slim victory over Obama,\" Ewen MacAskill and Suzanne Goldenberg write in today's Guardian. </p> <p>The McCain camp, they add, also signalled an attempt to return to an issues-based campaign, focused on the economy and his mortgage buyout plan, only days after announcing a \"gloves off\" attack on Obama's character and his former associations in Chicago. Obama, meanwhile, finds himself in a position to expand his playing field, and is buying television advertising and making appearances in several traditional Republican states.</p> <p>In the Nashville debate, McCain notably failed to mention the name of Bill Ayers, the co-founder of the Weather Underground, and aides to the senator were quoted yesterday saying he \"wouldn't focus\" on Obama's links to Ayers going forward, either. Sarah Palin, speaking in Florida, dropped all references to him. Then again, she mentioned him in a Fox interview last night, and the McCain campaign released a statement from a man named John Murtagh, descibing how the Weathermen had firebombed his house when he was nine. \"In other words,\" wrote Greg Sargent at Talking Points Memo, \"the McCain campaign wants Ayers to be discussed in the press, but doesn't want McCain - and now also Palin, perhaps - associated with such a slimy attack at a time when voters want solutions to the economic crisis.\" </p> <p>The Obama campaign sensed opportunity amid the negativity: it's to their advantage, of course, to point out where McCain seems to be trying to change the subject away from the economy. In an interview, the Democratic contender expressed surprise that McCain's campaign had been talking about Ayers, but that McCain hadn't been \"willing to say it to my face\".</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Obama is in Ohio today, McCain and Palin are in Wisconsin. We also learned yesterday that Oprah Winfrey is back on the Obama circuit. She'll appear with the candidate, his wife and the Bidens at a Chicago fundraiser this weekend.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Obama gained another two points in Gallup's daily tracking poll, putting him at 52% to McCain's 41% - his biggest lead of the election campaign so far. (The survey included almost no post-debate data.) Another interesting poll with relevance to the campaign, conducted by Public Religion Research, suggests that the \"culture wars\" may not have much purchase among young American Christians. It found that a majority of white evangelicals aged 18-34 favour either same-sex marriage or civil unions and that six in 10 young Catholics believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Obama has a clear lead among all US Catholics, at 51% to 40%. But white Catholics are evenly split, and they're a bellweather: they've voted with the winner of every presidential election since 1972, the Washington Post noted.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/09/uselections2008.barackobama\">Timothy Garton Ash: The US needs to get over its cultural civil war - and fast</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/08/uselections2008.virginia\">Younge America: An evening with a swing state gun lover</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/oct/08/uselections2008.johnmccain\">Tomasky talk: Republicans 'gently tossing in the towel'</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/09/uselections2008.johnmccain2\">Ask the experts: is it really over for McCain</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/09/uselections2008\">Roanoke voices: McCain campaign 'is desperate'</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/08/uselections2008.sarahpalin\">Tennessee politician's son indicted for hacking Palin's email</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=14019\">American Spectator: It's the culture, stupid</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/opinion/09collins.html?hp\">New York Times: Clearing the Ayers</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/10/norm_coleman_gets_pressed_on_s_1.php\">Talking Points Memo: the worst press conference ever?</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/08/AR2008100800090.html?hpid=topnews\">Washington Post: New contagion, same old prescriptions</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/us/politics/09voting.html?hp\">New York Times: States' actions to block voters appear illegal</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/08/is-sarahs-new-hairstyle-p_n_133048.html\">Huffington Post: Palin's new hairstyle</a></p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>Sit down, take a few deep breaths, then try to digest Sarah Palin justifying her references to Bill Ayers: \"It is pertinent, it's important because when you consider Barack Obama's reaction to and explanation to his association there, and without him being clear at all on what he knew and when he knew it, that I think kinda peaks into his ability to tell us the truth on, not only on association but perhaps other things also ... so, it's relevant, I believe, and I brought it up in response to the New York Times article having been printed recently, and I think it just makes us ask the question that, if there's not forthrightness there, with that association and what was known and when it was known, does that lead us to ask, is there forthrightness with the plans Barack Obama has or say tax cuts, or spending increases, makes us question judgment.

  "<p>The Katine project's independent evaluator, employed by the Guardian to monitor progress, has produced a highly critical report of Amref's work over the past year.</p> <p>A key area of concern in Rick Davies' second progress report is the management of the project, arguing that it is too centralised. Control over budgets and work plans are dictated from Amref's country office in Kampala, causing delays in purchasing resources and materials and resolving any problems that occur at local level, he argues, recommending that more responsibility for the project be delegated to the Katine office.</p> <p>Delays in approving work plans leave little time for actual implementation on the ground in Katine, he says, adding that over-centralisation has also led to increased costs. For example bicycles that were bought in Kampala could have been bought cheaper more locally. The evident lack of authority among local Katine project staff also diminishes their standing in the community.</p> <p>Davies believes the project needs to be more transparent to Katine residents. Suggestions outlined in the report include a public resource centre in Amref's office in Katine and public noticeboards erected in schools, offices and markets to display information, such as the minutes of meetings. Better budget transparency could include making public the unit cost of activities and purchases, such as latrines, bicycles and cashboxes. He does, however, acknowledge that this level of transparency will not be painless for Amref, and will inevitably invite criticism of how well the project is doing compared to other NGOs. </p> <p>He also highlights the lack of access to anti-malarial drugs and the small number of female teachers in the sub-county's schools.</p> <p>Amref believes Davies is being too harsh, arguing that delays in implementation have been largely due to an underestimation of the time needed to fully involve the community, and stating that changing how it manages projects would prove \"more expensive and burdensome\".</p> <p>The organisation also points out that as a result of healthcare training there have been no reported deaths from childbirth in Katine since the start of the project \u2013 the year before that there were three \u2013 an achievement in a country where 435 women per 100,000 births died unnecessarily from preventable conditions in pregnancy and childbirth last year.</p> <p>It notes that a lack of access to <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/health\">drugs</a></strong> is a national problem, and one that it's addressing through its wider work in the country.</p> <p>Since Rick's visit, a new school in <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/2008/sep/16/education.news\">Amorikot </a></strong>has been opened - seven classrooms and two offices have replaced mud and wattle structures - and refurbishment work is being carried out at three other schools. Some 2,000 textbooks have been distributed.</p> <p>Amref has also pledged to produce a strategy report on how it hopes to achieve community empowerment. It agrees with the need to foster greater transparency, but believes how this is done should be for community groups to decide.</p> <p>So has Davies been too harsh when clearly there has been significant change in Katine over the past year? Or is his report a timely wake-up call as we head into the next stage of the project?</p> <p>Read <strong><a href=\"http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2008/10/07/rdaviesreport.pdf\">his report</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2008/10/08/Amrefresponse.pdf\">Amref's response</a></strong> and tell us what you think.</p>",
  "<p>Half of all school authorities in England are in breach of the new admissions code, according to the chief adjudicator, Philip Hunter.</p> <p>There has been \"widespread\" failure by schools to remove discriminatory questions about parents' marital and employment status from application forms and to make clearer the definitions in their admissions rules, he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Half of admissions authorities - local councils and faith schools - are breaching the new rules introduced this year to make the process fairer, Hunter's national inquiry has found.</p> <p>He insisted that most problems were not intentional on the schools' part, but confirmed that some children would have been unfairly awarded places at their chosen school and others denied one this year as a result.</p> <p>Hunter is due to unveil his full report on compliance with the new code to ministers next month. </p> <p>It was ordered after a small-scale study of three authorities, ordered by the education secretary Ed Balls earlier this year, found schools breaking the laws - most controversially, by asking parents for financial contributions.</p> <p>Hunter will today reveal interim findings at a conference of admissions officers in London. Ahead of his speech, he told the Guardian: \"The secretary of state was quite right in saying we have a problem.</p> <p>\"It's not willful disregard of the law, but administrative confusion. It is quite widespread.\"</p> <p>Asked how widespread, he said: \"About half of them.\"</p> <p>His review has involved a sample of reports from admissions authorities: local councils oversee community schools, while faith schools and foundation schools are their own admissions authorities. </p> <p>Nine barristers have been assigned to assess the reports and judge whether the bodies are compliant.</p> <p>Hunter confirmed Balls's view expressed earlier this year that the bulk of the problems are in faith schools.</p> <p>The main problems to emerge from his review are:<br>\u2022 Admissions rules failing to provide proper definitions of parents, addresses and distances <br>\u2022 Supplementary forms asking inappropriate questions about parents' jobs or marital status<br>\u2022 Not giving children in care priority<br>\u2022 Applying rules that have been abolished, such as the \"first preference first\" rule that allowed schools to select keen families over others.</p> <p>He said he would recommend national definitions to be included in guidance to schools and authorities from next year.</p> <p>He has asked all authorities to address the criticisms and report back on the changes they are making within the month.</p>",
  "<p>The alleged teenage killer of Rhys Jones tried to cover his tracks after gunning the schoolboy down, a court heard today. </p> <p>Rhys was shot dead in a pub car park last August as he made his way home from football training in Croxteth Park.

  "<p>Live-in relationships will be put on a par with marriage in western India after the government of Maharashtra announced it would be seeking a change in the law's definition of a \"wife\".<br> At present women in India who are in non-martial relationships which end - either amicably or because they are deserted by their live-in partners - cannot seek alimony, a share of property or child maintenance. That is set to change in Maharashtra where officials have proposed an amendment to protect \"the pecuniary interests of a woman who was living with a man like his wife for a reasonably long time\". The move was welcomed by academics and charities working on women's rights as a long overdue step in recognising the changing social landscape in India.  In many cities, especially those with large information technology industries and Maharashtra's cosmopolitan capital Mumbai, young unmarried couples openly live together. Bollywood stars too flaunt their relationships. Ranjana Kumari, director of the Centre for Social Research in Delhi, said it was no surprise that Maharashtra had \"moved first to update its laws\".  \"Maharashtra has a very high percentage of working women and is progressive in the sense that live-in relationships are socially acceptable to the middle classes. You need a law that protects children and entitles these women to a share or property. It is a step forward in recognising the autonomous rights of women,\" said Kumari. The move was criticised by Hindu conservatives as being a \"step towards destroying the country's cultural fabric\". Surender Jain, spokesman of the World Hindu Council said: \"It will be bad for India to import these western ideas. We have seen in the west it leads to the breakdown of the family. In India it will see bigamy and prostitution rise.\" Bigamy is legal only for Muslims in India. Some feminists have questioned whether the law can be framed so to shield women from unscrupulous husbands. \"Live-in relationships raise questions about legal stance towards bigamy\u2026When bigamy is illegal in what sense can a live-in relationship be equal to a marriage, if either the man or the woman is already married?\" wrote Shoma Chatterji, author of The Indian Woman. Officials in Maharashtra will have to convince the central government to accept the proposed changes in state statute \u2013 but point out that a federal commission in 2003 recommended that women in live-in relationships should have the \"legal rights of a wife\". Earlier this year the supreme court declared that children born out of such a relationship should no longer be called illegitimate. But the central government has remained silent on the issue - aware any move might spark a backlash among conservatives.  \"The only change has been in the domestic violence laws which do protect women in these relationships. The hard part is that in many parts of the country women who tried to use the law would be killed or laughed out of police stations. Maharashtra and some southern states are more progressive in that respect,\" said Kumari.</p>",

  "<p>The world is moving closer to the final abolition of the death penalty, according to the latest figures published to coincide with World Day against the Death Penalty today.</p> <p>Five nations were responsible for almost all the state executions carried out in the past year. A total of 137 countries have abolished the death penalty in law or practice, while 60 countries retain its use, usually for people convicted of murder.</p> <p>There were at least 1,252 known executions in 24 countries during 2007. Of all the executions in 2007, 88% took place in China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the US.</p> <p>By the end of 2007, 91 countries had abolished the death penalty for all crimes and three more (Albania, the Cook Islands and Rwanda) have since joined them, according to Reprieve, which represents death row prisoners around the world.</p> <p>\"The reality is that despite the progress that has been made over the last 18 months, there are still thousands of people being executed every year around the world,\" said Clive Stafford Smith, the director of Reprieve.</p> <p>\"I have witnessed the barbarity of this sentence in person, having been present at the execution of four of my clients and can say that one execution is too many. We cannot rest until capital punishment becomes little more than an embarrassing chapter in our history.\"</p> <p>In Europe, only Belarus retains capital punishment. Countries with the death penalty cannot join the EU. </p> <p>The US is the only country in the Americas to have carried out any executions since 2003. Its 53 executions in 2006 represented the lowest annual total for a decade, and death sentences continue to drop from a peak in the mid-1990s.</p> <p>\"Asia leads the way globally as the continent that carries out the most executions,\" said the Amnesty International UK director, Kate Allen. </p> <p>\"The number of executions carried out by China last year makes them the world's number one executioner. This year we have seen a noticeable increase in the use of the death penalty in Japan. Executions in that country are typically shrouded in secrecy. And in Pakistan there are approximately 7,500 people, including children, on death row \u2026 We call on Asia's state leaders to establish a moratorium on executions with a view to abolish the death penalty.\"</p> <p>In some areas with a long tradition of executions, such as central Asia, there is a clear move towards abolition. Recently, Kyrgyzstan abolished the death penalty for ordinary crimes, Kazakhstan has had a moratorium on executions since 2003 and Tajikistan has had moratoriums on executions and death sentences since 2004.</p> <p>In Africa, only six countries carried out executions in 2006. Last year the high court in Malawi declared the mandatory death penalty unconstitutional and Rwanda abolished it. Burundi, Gabon and Mali are taking steps towards abolition.</p> <p>In seven countries the death penalty is applied for consensual sexual acts between adults of the same sex: Iran, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen and parts of Nigeria.</p> <p>Iran retains the death penalty for a large number of offences, among them \"cursing the Prophet,\" certain drug offences, murder, adultery, incest, rape, drinking alcohol and sodomy. Last year Iran executed at least 317 people, including eight juvenile offenders. </p> <p>In 2007, Saudi Arabia executed at least 143 people, including children and three women. This year's has already reached 58.</p> <p>Pakistan retains the death penalty for 26 offences including murder, blasphemy, arms trading, drug trafficking, armed robbery, stripping a woman of her clothes in public, extramarital sex and rape. Yemen retains it for a variety of offences, among them endangering transport and communications, apostasy, robbery, prostitution and adultery.</p> <h2>Reports of executions in 2007</h2> <br>China: 470+ <br>Iran: 317+ <br>Saudi Arabia: 143+ <br>Pakistan: 135+ <br>US: 42 <br>Iraq: 33+ <br>Vietnam: 25+ <br>Yemen: 15+ <br>Afghanistan: 15 <br>Libya: 9+",

Troubled financial group Dexia jumped 25% after France, Belgium and Luxembourg announced they had agreed to provide state guarantees to help it borrow.</p> <p>Wall Street is expected to stage a rally and shrug off some of the 2% fall of the Dow Jones industrial average last night after the US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, signalled that the government could invest in banks to help restore confidence in the sector.</p> <p>Speaking after the concerted interest rate cuts announced yesterday by the world's major central banks, Paulson appeared to suggest that the US treasury may follow the UK's lead by taking stakes in many US banks.</p> <p>\"We will use all of the tools we've been given to maximum effectiveness, including strengthening the capitalisation of financial institutions of every size,\" he told a news conference.</p> <p>Striking a cautious tone that sent shares sliding on Wall Street last night, Paulson cautioned the US rescue plan will not save all firms. \"One thing we must recognize - even with the new treasury authorities, some financial institutions will fail,\" he said, adding that regulators will take measures to limit the systemic risk from any single bank failure.</p> <p>Asian central banks have now joined in yesterday's unprecedented global rate cut. South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan all lowered their benchmark interest rates by a quarter point overnight. This followed half-point cuts from the Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and other European central banks. </p> <p>Asian stockmarkets were mixed, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng rising 3.3% and shares in Seoul up 0.6%, while Taiwan's index dropped 1.45%.</p> <p>The Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, said his government was prepared to buy stakes in failing banks while waiving voting rights. Italy has been largely shielded from the global financial turmoil because its banking sector is mostly retail, relying on savers' deposits rather than money markets. </p> <p>Germany may have to consider nationalising its banks if the crisis continues to worsen, finance minister Peer Steinbrueck told a newspaper. </p> <p>\"Just lowering interest rates would be far from sufficient in the current situation,\" said Amar Gill at CLSA in Singapore. \"The main problem now is that banks are not lending to weaker banks, and the overall banking system is not lending to corporates.\" </p> <p>The Bank of Japan did not take part in the coordinated rate cuts as its interest rates are already near zero, but the country's finance minister, Shoichi Nakagawa, welcomed the move. The Nikkei index closed down 0.5% at 9,157.<br></p>",
  "<p>\"Fury over cat eating festival\" ran a headline in yesterday's Sun newspaper, above, as you might expect, a story about fury, festivals and the <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article1782932.ece\">consumption of cats</a>. </p> <p>I imagine that a collective sigh of relief was audible in the Sun's newsroom when this \"massacre of the moggies\" news item was unearthed from the bowels of Google. The minutiae of the economic calamity we're all facing is both terrifying and tedious in equal measure and, frankly, I think we've all had it just about up to here. So it must have been bliss to stumble across a story that brilliantly combines two staples of tabloid journalism: pictures of baby animals being cute and tales of foreigners doing the funniest things.</p> <p>The Sun used a photograph of two adorable fluffy kittens to illustrate a story about the <a href=\"http://www.peru.com/noticias/sgc/PORTADA/2008/09/22/detalle6612.aspx\">Festival Gastronomico del Gato</a>, which takes place every September in the town of La Quebrada, Peru, to celebrate the day of Santa Efigenio. The festival involves the eating of cats \u2013 which is why animal rights activist group, Peta, is in a fury.</p> <p>Here we go again. Another shock horror story about people from other cultures who just don't understand the difference between animals you cuddle and animals you cover in sauce. Cats are pets, cows are dinner \u2013 we know the rules, so why doesn't everyone else? The inevitable outcry over consumption of the wrong sort of animal is just as inevitably followed by accusations of western cultural imperialism and hypocrisy from people who take themselves terribly seriously.</p> <p>The rights, wrongs and cultural relativism of cat and dog meat have been regularly rehashed during events such as the 1988 Olympics and 2002 World Cup, which both took place in dog-eating South Korea and the recent Olympics in China \u2013 a culture where very little seems to be off the menu.</p> <p>In Britain, we have an unusually proscriptive view of acceptable sources of meat \u2013 obviously cats and dogs and, in more recent times, rabbits and horses, are too friendly to be food. But it's not just cute, cuddly animals we avoid: few British people would want to tuck into snake, insects or rodents \u2013 all of which are eaten with great relish in other parts of the world.</p> <p>But this doesn't necessarily mean we're hopelessly hypocritical or irrationally sentimental. Much of the outrage about dog and cat meat in parts of Asia arises because of the shockingly brutal way many of these animals are kept and killed. It's not hypocritical to eat pigs that have been slaughtered to British animal welfare standards at the same time as being appalled by the fact that some cats and dogs are beaten to death or boiled alive before being served at the table in countries with no animal welfare legislation at all.</p> <p>There are, of course, some people who will wield a pen in one hand to write an outraged letter to the Peruvian government about cat slaughter, while the other hand is holding a sandwich filled with a battery-farmed chicken carcass. But most of those who responded to the Sun's article online suggest a more astute understanding of our complex relationship with edible and inedible animals: \"just think of them as very small cows. Job done.\" Reads one comment.</p> <p>Another asks why animal rights groups aren't up in arms about the turkey eating festival held annually in the UK. To be fair to Peta, this isn't at all fair: they are, in fact, up in arms about the consumption of meat, milk, fur and any other animal derived substance wherever it occurs: Peta has; \"toured slaughterhouses for dogs in Taiwan, horses in Texas, and chickens and cows in Europe,\" and they weren't happy with any of it. You might not like them, but you can't accuse them of inconsistency.</p> <p>Perhaps the most unaskable question is whether cats are worth eating. I haven't eaten the meat of any animal for more than 20 years, but if I was to fall off the wagon, I don't think it would be leg of cat that I'd have a hankering for. Cats have, of course, been eaten in this country, but only in instances of extreme poverty or culinary fraud \u2013 cats are easy to come by and, in a pie, who'd notice? Even if they weren't valued as companions by so many people, I don't think they'd be the chef's favourite cut. So I think we can safely put the Peruvian cat eating festival down to one of those odd things that people far away do. Unless, of course, the credit crunch turns really bad and there's nothing left in the larder but the cat.</p>",
  "<p>When Hitler addressed a crowd of 15,000 party faithful in Berlin's Sportpalast on September 26 1938 and demanded that Czechoslovakia cede the Sudetenland or face invasion, his words reached far beyond the borders of the Reich.</p> <p>Before the F\u00fchrer rose to speak, the German radio announcer named literally dozens of countries, from Lithuania to Uruguay, where the speech was being broadcast live. The Nazis provided simultaneous translations of the F\u00fchrer's words, and international correspondents were also in the Sportpalast, capturing at the microphone the dramatic atmosphere of this Wagnerian event. Among them was CBS's Bill Shirer, who speculated that Neville Chamberlain and his French counterpart Edouard Daladier were probably among the many millions sitting at their radio sets, in all likelihood feeling distinctly uneasy as the F\u00fchrer scolded them like unruly children. At this stage Hitler knew that he could say more or less what he liked: Chamberlain had already assured him that if he promised the Sudetenland would be Germany's \"last territorial claim\", Britain would give him the green light to take whichever chunks of Czechoslovakia he wanted.</p> <p>By 1938 people in Germany were more than familiar with Hitler's spectacular public appearances - there were even distinct signs of F\u00fchrer fatigue - but imagine how menacing this barking, staccato speech, punctuated with cheers and Heil Hitlers, must have sounded to radio listeners in the American Mid-West, their regular music programmes suddenly interrupted by an announcer declaring that they were going over live to Berlin. It must have seemed like a voice from another planet. We should hardly be surprised that when CBS broadcast Orson Welles' famous radio adaptation of The War of the Worlds just a few weeks after Munich, thousands really believed Martians had landed in New Jersey. After Hitler, nothing on the airwaves seemed unthinkable.</p> <p>The Munich crisis was a milestone in radio history. Starting with the Austrian Anschluss in March of the same year, this was the first world diplomatic crisis to be played out at every step on the airwaves. Radio had reached maturity: in Europe and North America nearly every household owned or had access to a radio set, all the sides knew that radio could win hearts and minds and as the crisis moved on at a lightning pace - with the breakneck speed of events also defined by the new culture of instant communication - radio helped to make history. </p> <p>It was during the crisis that the American radio networks more or less invented a format that we now take for granted in news broadcasting: the daily news round-up with live reports from around the world including breaking news as it happens, interviews and expert comment. Thanks to charismatic radio reporters like Bill Shirer or Ed Murrow who were rapidly becoming household names in the United States, American radio listeners were - paradoxically - far better informed about what was going on in Europe than their European counterparts. This extract from Ed Murrow's report the day after the Austrian Anschluss in March 1938, was typical of this new, more personal and direct style. It left the listener in no doubt about what was really going on in Europe:</p> <p>\"It was called a bloodless conquest and in some ways it was - but I'd like to be able to forget the haunted look on the faces of those long lines of people outside the banks and travel offices. People trying to get away ... I'd like to forget the sound of smashing glass as the Jewish shop streets were raided; the hoots and jeers at those forced to scrub the sidewalk...\"</p> <p>But for the British public Czechoslovakia remained - in Chamberlain's infamous words - \"a faraway country\", and it was in no small measure thanks to the British prime minister himself that the Czechs and Sudeten Germans remained people \"of whom we know nothing\". In his staunch conviction that appeasement was the only realistic way of ensuring \"peace for our time\", he went out of his way to make sure that the British public was not informed about the complexities of the situation in Central Europe.</p> <p>The BBC was in the front line. Chamberlain had already won over a large section of the British press. A devastating editorial in the Times on September 7 1938 openly advocated carving up Czechoslovakia, and when the newspaper stated that this view had \"found favour in some quarters\", everyone knew that this meant Mr Chamberlain himself. In relations with the BBC, Chamberlain did not stop short of direct intervention, and while news bulletins remained balanced, other programmes were subject to tight scrutiny. Anything that might be controversial was sent directly to the Foreign Office press department for approval. If it was rejected, the BBC was under strict instructions not to let listeners know that the decision had come from the government. Among those who found themselves at the receiving end of this censorship was Harold Nicolson, who was forced to drop a talk about Czechoslovakia. Despite his anger, he rather apologetically explained during his replacement lecture on milk prices that the situation was so delicate \"that anything I say could perhaps be twisted into something which might give offence to the German people with whom we all desire to live on terms of friendship.\" </p> <p>At the same time Chamberlain was brilliant in the way he stage-managed his three trips to Germany to meet the F\u00fchrer, making sure that reporters were there in abundance to hear his carefully prepared soundbites as he departed. On the third occasion, when he flew from Heston Aerodrome on September 29 to seal Czechoslovakia's fate in Munich, an ebullient BBC reporter described the atmosphere as being \"almost like a first night\", as the prime minister waved his hat \"with a gesture of nonchalance and gaiety\". </p> <p>To the horror of the many dissidents among BBC staff - known collectively as the \"warmongers\" - the BBC had helped to turn Chamberlain into the supreme elder statesman. A few days after Munich, John Coatman, a former Home Service chief news editor, sent an in-house memorandum to the BBC Programme Board, in which he concluded that, had the service offered more balanced coverage, \"it might, probably would, have made all the difference between the surrender to which democracy has submitted and the negotiation of a real peace which would have left Europe secure.\" Perhaps this was no exaggeration. </p> <p>Chamberlain had learned a lot from Goebbels, who had been intensely aware of the potential of radio from the moment he became propaganda minister in 1933. Goebbels defined radio as the main instrument of his propaganda policy, and Germany began broadcasting across the border to Czechoslovakia's 3.5m German speakers almost as soon as the Nazis came to power. As is so often the case of a somewhat cumbersome democratic state in the face of dictatorship, Czechoslovakia was agonizingly slow to recognize the danger of Nazi radio propaganda. As late as 1938, less than eight percent of the broadcasts by Radiojournal - as Czechoslovak Radio was then known - were in German, although German speakers made up a quarter of the population.</p> <p>Milena Jesensk\u00e1, one of the most brilliant Czech journalists of her generation (most often remembered for her brief affair with Franz Kafka many years earlier) described the situation thus: \"For five years all that people in the borderlands have had to do is to turn a switch and Nazi ideology from the German stations has flowed directly into their homes - it goes without saying that they all tuned into stations that they could understand! ... As a counter to this, all we offered was half an hour of German radio, most of it dull and indigestible. Only by now they are all perfectly schooled, sweet-talked and bullied, repeating parrot-fashion phrases about their national space.\"</p> <p>As the tension increased at the beginning of September 1938, radio became more than just a tool of propaganda. For some days, pro-Hitler Sudeten German activists had been working with agents from the Reich to sow the seeds of a coup in the Sudetenland, which would effectively turn its annexation by Germany into a reality on the ground. The cue for the uprising was to be Hitler's speech on September 12, which was broadcast live from the Nuremberg party rally on all German radio stations. With each sentence, the F\u00fchrer stirred the Sudeten Germans to rebellion. The British journalist, Sydney Morrell, witnessed the speech's impact in the spa town of Karlovy Vary (Karlsbad), where he listened in the company of an elderly Sudeten German widow and her teenage son. While the widow got rather bored, \"her son, his head pillowed on his arms, huddled up to the loud-speaker, listened avidly, his bright eyes darting round the room, seeing visions ...\" Such was the alchemy of radio.</p> <p>As soon as the speech was over, Morrell went out into the streets of the town, where large crowds were gathering, singing the Nazi anthem, the Horst Wessel song, which, like the swastika, was banned in Czechoslovakia. Still more menacingly: \"In a side street I heard the crash of glass and ran towards the sound. They were smashing the windows of Jewish shops.\" </p> <p>Such scenes were repeated throughout the Sudetenland. As tensions heightened, the pro-Nazi Sudeten German Party's press spokesman, Oskar Ullrich - very much a spin-doctor in the modern mould - made sure he was always available to provide foreign correspondents with vivid accounts in fluent English of \"Czech atrocities\". Naively confident in their country's motto \"Truth will Prevail\", Czech and Slovak politicians rarely bothered to respond, and in the meantime the German version of the incident had shot around the world. </p> <p>If we are in any doubt about how central radio had come to people's lives, we only need to recall an episode in Prague, a few days after the attempted Sudeten coup had, at least in part, been brought under control. Chamberlain had just held his infamous meeting with Hitler at Berchtesgaden and returned beaming and confident that the F\u00fchrer was a man with whom he could do business. With the utmost reluctance, the Czechoslovak government succumbed to intense pressure from Britain and France, and agreed on September 21 that it would give up the Sudetenland without a fight.</p> <p>The announcement was made on the radio and was also relayed through loudspeakers on Wenceslas Square, the busiest thoroughfare in the heart of Prague. Everything stopped - pedestrians, cars and even trams - and the crowds stood in stunned silence. But they did not disperse. More and more people gathered, soon amounting to tens of thousands, and then they turned not to the cabinet office or the president's office at Prague Castle but instead to the rather austere modern headquarters of the radio just above the square. A small group broke into the building. As a witness later remembered, \"people felt that the tragic news had been declared from this building and that it could only be reversed from this building.\" An anonymous man from the crowd sat down uneasily in front of the microphone. His statement, in broken and scarcely comprehensible sentences, remains one of the most moving moments in the whole crisis. He appealed for a government of soldiers and for his country to be given a chance to fight. </p> <p>Radio had come out of the shadow of history. After this extraordinary impromptu broadcast and another huge demonstration the next morning, the Czechoslovak government really did resign, with the First World War hero General Jan Syrovy taking over as prime minister. Twenty-four hours later a general mobilization was declared. </p> <p>But this was not enough to persuade Czechoslovakia's Western allies to come to the country's aid. Czechoslovakia's determination to fight was pared down by Chamberlain's equal determination to avoid war at whatever cost. When the Munich agreement was finally signed, just after midnight on September 30 1938, in the absence of any Czechoslovak representative, the spirit of a nation was broken in an instant. While Chamberlain was waving his \"piece of paper\" in triumph at Heston Aerodrome, Czechoslovakia's leaders also took to the air, to break the news to their own people. The American journalist Vincent Sheean described in his diary how, as they listened on Wenceslas Square, people \"moved aimlessly here and there, without direction, most often without speaking\". And as the Justice Minister Ivan D\u00e9rer took to the air his voice broke down completely. Sydney Morrell happened to be in the radio building at that moment and described D\u00e9rer as \"a man who was being torn to shreds inside himself\", a vivid enough symbol of what was happening to the entire country. </p> <p>Ivan D\u00e9rer's speech has a strong resonance with another radio address that was made almost exactly thirty years later. When Alexander Dubcek returned from Moscow in the days shortly after the reforms of the Prague Spring had been shattered by the Warsaw Pact invasion in August 1968, he also spoke on the radio. Under circumstances that were depressingly similar to 1938, his voice also broke down as he tried to explain to his country's citizens that they stood alone in the face of occupation and it was beyond their power to resist the tide of history.<br> While the BBC remained silent on Czechoslovakia's fate, British radio listeners did still have a chance to hear an uncensored version of events, thanks to radio's disregard for national borders. Immediately after Munich, correspondents from around the world disappeared from Prague as fast as they had come, but one broadcaster who stubbornly remained was Jonathan Griffin, a soft-spoken, round-spectacled intellectual, rather aristocratic in demeanour. He was later to become the wartime head of European intelligence at the BBC and after the war had an extraordinary second blossoming as a poet, now undeservedly almost forgotten. His series of broadcasts from Prague in the three weeks that followed Munich, capture the atmosphere of a country betrayed, and predict with absolute precision the future fate of Czechoslovakia. They were not broadcast by the BBC - they were far too critical - but by Czechoslovakia's shortwave service, broadcasting in English for Britain and America. Here is an extract from Griffin's broadcast on October 1, one day after Munich:</p> <p>\"Why did the same event, the four-power agreement in Munich, produce opposite effects in the two peoples - for you jubilation, for the people here profound misery? Because for the moment you have peace, but you have got it, for the moment, on the cheap, at others' expense. For the moment you have paid for it nothing noticeable except the frightful responsibility of which some of you may be aware. Later on you will find that you have mortgaged the security of Great Britain and her security as a great power, and that by allowing your government to violate solemn pledges and ride roughshod over international justice and morality, you have let loose over Europe an anarchy that may well make the peace that you have so dearly bought uneasy and short.\"</p> <p>Less than a year later, the world was at war.</p>",

  "<p>The UK's goods trade deficit with the rest of the world was bigger than expected in August, leading economists to warn that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/recession\">the British economy has now fallen into recession</a>.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics reported today that Britain's goods trade gap reached \u00a38.198bn in August, well above City forecasts of \u00a37.6bn.</p> <p>July's deficit has also been revised upwards to \u00a38.238bn, the biggest monthly goods trade gap since records began in 1697.</p> <p>Paul Dales, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the data supported other evidence suggesting that the UK entered a recession in the last three months. </p> <p>\"Looking ahead, exporters are going to struggle against the background of a rapidly weakening world economy, as survey measures of export orders have recently fallen very sharply. Overall, these figures suggest that the weakening in overseas activity is deepening the downturn in the UK economy,\" Dales added. </p> <p>Investec economist Philip Shaw said the figures showed how unbalanced the UK economy has become.</p> <p>The goods trade gap with non-EU countries widened to \u00a35.165bn from \u00a34.778bn.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/07/partyfunding.conservatives\">David Hencke</a> and his investigative colleagues at the Guardian have a fine record of unearthing dubious and corrupt practices in British politics. The Conservative party has a longer but not so fine record of being less than transparent and clean in its finances. From the share it took from the sale of honours in the 1920s to the secretive \"river companies\" set up in the 1940s to channel funds to the massive donations from wealthy foreigners it accepted in the 1990s, it is not surprising that the arrangements over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/oct/02/partyfunding.conservatives2006\">Constituency Campaigning Services</a> (CCS) have attracted suspicion. But sometimes, as Freud observed, a cigar is just a cigar, and even with political finance sometimes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/06/partyfunding.conservatives\">a company is just a company</a>.</p> <p>Forensic accountancy is a difficult business, as I found out when I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/dec/11/highereducation.biography1\">tried to unravel</a> the business dealings of Reginald Maudling and John Poulson, but the Electoral Commission takes its investigative duties seriously. If the commission's <a href=\"http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/news-and-media/news-releases/electoral-commission-media-centre/news-releases-donations/statement-by-the-electoral-commission2\">conclusion</a> is that CCS charged commercial rates for its services, and therefore did not effectively donate to the Conservative party, it is incumbent on its critics to find solid evidence to the contrary. </p> <p>It is hard to see how paying the going rate amounts to an abuse of the spending limits, or a donation to the party. Whatever the party pays has to be within the spending limits, and any free or discounted services must also be accounted for. Nor is CCS entirely exempt from transparency rules. As with other organisations made up mostly of party members, it must report donations to the commission, which <a href=\"http://registers.electoralcommission.org.uk/regulatory-issues/regdpoliticalparties.cfm\">publishes them</a> on its website. In recent years, the Conservative party has tried to be punctilious about following the letter of the rules, in something of the spirit of a reformed alcoholic making long detours to avoid his former favourite pub. </p> <p>While it is not ideal that CCS does not have to publish its accounts, it is not the commission's fault that the law fails to require it to do so. The government has the opportunity to tighten this up in its party funding bill.<br>Given the high profile of the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6051200.stm\">Midlands Industrial Council</a> (MIC) as CCS's funder, it is easy to see why some think the money has been funnelled into the party, but the commission's conclusion means that there could be other, potentially more entertaining possibilities. There would, after all, be a gentle irony if the prominent businessmen behind MIC had wasted so much money on keeping an unprofitable business afloat for the sake of party pride. </p> <p>It is also unfair to blame the commission for the fact that the \"cash for honours\" affair did not result in any prosecutions. It was mainly focused on the <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1925/cukpga_19250072_en_1\">Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925</a>, a notoriously sloppy piece of legislative drafting that has nothing to do with the commission. And perhaps nothing that bad happened in the first place. Simply labelling something \"cash for honours\" does not mean that a trade took place. The \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/1994/oct/20/conservatives.uk\">cash for questions</a>\" affair at least had witnesses and hard evidence.</p> <p>The Electoral Commission is in a difficult position, in that it has to rule on matters that are highly contentious, and often has to irritate one side or other of the political spectrum. It has to do so within the law as it stands; that is frustrating, perhaps, but it is up to parliament to amend the law. The commission is far from a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/07/partyfunding.conservatives\">toothless watchdog</a>, as Hencke says. If anything, there is an argument that its teeth are too sharp. It can growl, by issuing advice, and maul, by referring situations to the police for further action, but it has not been given the power to give minor offenders an admonitory nip to the ankle. However, in the case of CCS, it seems that a growl was really all that the situation called for.</p>",

From <a href=\"http://adsense.blogspot.com/2008/10/get-in-game-with-adsense-for-games.html\">Googles Adsense Blog</a>:</p> <p>Members of our AdWords team will sell your in-game ad placements directly to top brand advertisers, and you'll also see contextually targeted text and image ads based on content and demographic information. In addition, you'll be able to control the ads you see on your pages using our filtering options.</p> <p>Google has helpfully produced a video to show what an Adsense for Games placement will look like. I can't get the bloody thing to embed so <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPAslXR6xCc\">here's a link to YouTube</a>. <br></p> <p>Several partners have already signed up including indie game stronghold, <a href=\"http://armorgames.com/\">Armor</a>, and Konami, which is planning to produce Flash versions of games like Dance Dance Revolution and Frogger. As for advertisers, <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2008/10/07/google-launches-in-game-advertising-for-flash-web-games/\">according to VentureBeat</a>, Sony Pictures and US telecommunications giant Sprint are on board.</p> <p>The response from rival in-game ad companies has been interesting. Jonathan Epstein, CEO of DoubleFusion,<a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-10060732-52.html\"> enthused to CNET</a>, \"it confirms for all parties...that this space is of interest to one of the largest media companies in the world.

  "<p>Apparently, it takes more than the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/09/useconomy.creditcrunch1\">imminent meltdown of global capitalism</a> to shake Simon Heffer out of his trenchant free market views. Like a magnificent, iron-clad dreadnought ploughing ahead at full steam through choppy waters, the Telegraph's star columnist is not about to be turned.</p> <p>Today's paper grants him <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/10/09/do0901.xml&amp;page=1\">an entire page</a> to pen 1,500-words of invective which unhesitatingly condemns Gordon Brown's <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7658277.stm\">recapitalisation of the banks</a> as an Old Labour Trojan horse which will take us meekly back to the statist days of the 1970s.</p> <p>\"We're all socialists now,\" he booms ironically below a mocked up picture of the prime minister in full Soviet military dress:</p> <blockquote> <p>The intervention, or rather interference, of the state in financial and economic matters can only lead to sclerosis, the suppression of enterprise, the raising of taxes, starvation of investment, lack of innovation, technological retardation and the rise of the power of organised labour.</p> </blockquote> <p>Heffer is now in full flow, speculating about a possible \"new socialist policy on lending\":</p> <blockquote> <p>Will it be easier for Labour's client groups to get loans to buy housing, or even to buy a car, than those deemed to be more affluent?</p> </blockquote> <p>Moreover, he predicts, this \"neo-sovietisation\" will prove so alluring to the government that even if the banks are turned around there is a risk they will remain under permanent state control.</p> <p>It's strong stuff, but Heffer isn't finished yet.</p> <p>Not content with implicitly dismissing the <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122350283630616859.html\">Wall Street Journal</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d4d9a8de-959b-11dd-aedd-000077b07658.html\">FT</a> as lily-livered leftists, he approvingly quotes the uber-individualist author and philosopher, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Atlas-Shrugged-Ayn-Rand/dp/0451191145\">Ayn Rand</a>, to surmise that \"the difference between a welfare state and a totalitarian state is a matter of time\".</p> <p>Blimey. Even some of Heffer's loyal readership, used to his regular pot shots at David Cameron for being insufficiently keen on tax cuts, are taken aback. One, John Mack, writes on the paper's website:</p> <blockquote> <p>Simon, I missed the part where you pointed out what should have been done, and how a true capitalist approach would have ensured we never got into this mess in the first place.</p> </blockquote> <p>By way of a quick contrast, if Heffer is a man who has woken up in a nightmare where James Callaghan never lost power, then the Guardian's very own <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/seumasmilne\">Seumas Milne</a> must think all his Christmases have come at once.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/oct/09/banking.banks\">a column</a> almost as full of fruity invective as Heffer's (Brown's plan \"delivered the funeral rites on the corpse of high Thatcherism\") Milne calls for considerably greater state control of banking.</p> <p>Failed banks, he argues, should be fully nationalised as \"the core of a newly accountable and publicly controlled banking sector able to channel investment where it's needed, rather than into reckless speculation in debt and housing bubbles\".</p> <p>It's like the 1970s all over again. Stand by for more of the same as the crisis rolls on.</p> <p><em>* Based on an extract from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/wrap\">the Wrap</a>, guardian.co.uk's digest of the day's news</em></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/michaelgrade\">Michael Grade</a>, the <a href=\"http://guardian.co.uk/media/itv\">ITV</a> executive chairman, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/oct/08/itv.television\">spiced up the debate on public service broadcasting at an RTS breakfast this week</a> when he promoted a way to save regional news on ITV - create a non-profit trust to provide news for the regions, funded by public money.</p> <p>What a marvellous distraction from the 430 news jobs going from the regions. But be warned, a gathering storm rumbles around ITN and communications minister Stephen Carter is on the horizon.</p> <p>At Grade's press conference after his speech, we all raced after the non-profit trust idea, as we were intended to do. But, as a battle-hardened peer of the realm listening in remarked to me after the event: \"This sounds like a diversionary hare to me.\"</p> <p>The real worry for MPs and peers is the here and now: 490 news jobs are going, in key constituencies. The West Country and Teesside are up in arms. The cut of one third of the total regional news budget represents the most inflammatory decision that Ofcom's public service broadcast review has thrown up. It will worry viewers more than the problems facing Channel 4. </p> <p>But ITV's \"solution\" is a canny one, allowing it to look constructive, back a quasi-Ofcom proposal, and deflect some of the political attacks. Remember, one early solution that Channel 4 could shoulder the responsibility, on More 4, was knocked back as reality intruded. Only a small fraction of ITV's audience ever watch More 4.</p> <p>Grade's proposal though, superficially offers the lure of continuity. The popular 6pm news hour would survive. ITV would gift the regional news slot to a trust, but still sell the advertising. It is a win-win for the commercial network - it loses a loss-making commitment, keeps the fiction alive of regional roots, and doesn't have to make further redundancies. All it takes is for politicians to come up with the funds from somewhere for the services they treasure - not ITV. </p> <p>Grade mentioned that ITN could provide the regional news service. But equally, since public money is involved, someone else, such as Sky News, Press Association, Reuters or an entirely new outfit could provide the service.</p> <h2>The ITN issue</h2> <p>In my view this proposal raises a deeper issue, which is rumbling around in the background like a gathering thunderstorm. What happens to ITN, the national news provider, in which ITV is the major 40% shareholder? ITV regional news is a major force in the production of national bulletins, providing coverage of major stories, from floods to murders, through an extensive newsgathering network backed by satellite dishes. In London, the regional news service shares the ITN head office. </p> <p>The current cuts seek to protect news at the expense of softer features. But inevitably ITN's coverage will suffer as cuts go further: its own executives say as much. ITN also supplies highly regarded Channel 4 News, for about \u00a320m a year - the team of dedicated correspondents and editorial team draw on the same footage. The Channel 4 contract runs until the end of next year. </p> <p>It is fair to say the developments are unsettling it too. The ITN chief executive, Mark Wood, is stepping down after six years. Insiders say the strategy, building up other profit-making businesses from archive and news clips is not generating the revenue expected.</p> <p>Finally, over all of this hangs the question of resolve and will. One thing uniting all the broadcasters is a need for action. They are worn ragged by the endless consultations. They want a solution for a broken system. </p> <h2>Need for action</h2> <p>But that requires government drive at a time for huge distraction. It is fair to say that the arrival of Carter, made a peer to become communications minister with a brief covering broadcasting, is seen by the business side of the media as a very good thing. Ofcom is delighted, it has its man (Carter was the founding Ofcom chief executive) in the government. The question is whether he can find the money. </p> <p>It comes down to this: the only sources of public service cash are the BBC licence fee, and, more doubtfully, BBC Worldwide. But everyone at the RTS breakfast knew that, with talk of a new trust, top-slicing is back on the agenda. </p> <p>However, any move to secure legislation and changes to licences will need cross-party support. And a consensus of sorts. Can someone unelected, if not fresh to politics, forge that?</p>",
  "<p>The Cactus Kid is no more. He has been expelled from our TV screens. Those entertaining ads for Oasis fruit drinks \u2013 in which the green and spiky-skinned Cactus Kid and his young pregnant girlfriend run away from their parents in a Badlands-style mini-road movie \u2013 have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/08/asa.advertising\">judged \"offensive\" and \"irresponsible\"</a> by the <a href=\"http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/\">Advertising Standards Authority</a>.</p> <p>Why? Because they apparently \"condone underage sex and teenage pregnancy\", and the slogan \u2013 \"Oasis: for people who don't like water\" \u2013 might \"discourage good dietary practice\". So the Cactus Kid has been spiked.</p> <p>Nothing better sums up the humourlessness, po-facedness and all-round miserabilism of the men in suits who rule over us than the effective banning of an advert for being \"pro-teenage sex\" and \"anti-water\". There's a word for people who are horrified by the idea of youngsters fornicating and who want to encourage a spartan-style, water-consuming lifestyle: puritans. Or maybe it's prigs.</p> <p>Either way, the ASA has shown itself once more to be a pompous, dictatorial gang of censors which thinks nothing of removing from our TV screens anything it finds \"offensive\". It's time the ASA was spiked and the Cactus Kid reinstated.</p> <p>The ASA represents the tyranny of the minority. There were 32 complaints \u2013 yes, 32! \u2013 about the Oasis adverts. And on that basis, of the hurt feelings of an infinitesimal number of supersensitive viewers, the ads \"must not be shown again in their current form\".</p> <p>What about the other 10 or 20 million of us who saw the ads and who were not consumed by a fantastic fear that they would give rise to teenage debauchery and mass disrespect for water? We don't count, it seems. What we may watch will be determined for us by 32 whingers and their cynical facilitators in the ASA.</p> <p>The ASA is forever forcing the minority puritan view on the rest of us. In March, it <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7291155.stm\">ruled against</a> a TV advert for GHD hair products after receiving 23 complaints. The ad described GHD as \"religion for the hair\" and featured scantily clad women in a state of supplication, clutching rosary beads as they gave praise to GHD's products. The ASA said the ad might be offensive to Christians.</p> <p>So in the same year that we finally ditched our dusty, backward, censorious <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/07/whenblasphemybitthedust\">blasphemy laws</a>, we had the newfangled ASA banning something on the basis that it might offend a religious group.</p> <p>This year, the ASA also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jan/30/asa.advertising/\">ruled</a> that a newspaper advert for Ryanair \u2013 which featured a Britney-style schoolgirl and the slogan \"Hottest back to school fares\" \u2013 could cause \"serious or widespread offence\". Actually, no widespread offence was taken.</p> <p>The ad appeared in three newspapers with a combined readership of 4 million and how many people complained? Thirteen. I know it is deeply unfashionable to say anything nice about Ryanair, but its <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/01/30/ryanair_offensive_ad/\">counterattack on the ASA</a> for being \"a bunch of unelected, self-appointed dimwits\" is undoubtedly true. And funny.</p> <p>Some will argue that advertising is not a free speech issue. Certainly it is not a level playing field. You need money to make your voice heard in the TV schedules or on roadside billboards. I find it infuriating that I cannot afford to take out a TV ad for my online magazine, <a href=\"http://www.spiked-online.com/\">spiked</a>, even though, if you ask me, it is a far tastier and more rejuvenating product than the sugary fruit drinks made by Oasis.</p> <p>Yet this shouldn't blind us to the fact that the ASA is practising naked and patronising censorship. From its imposition of minority viewpoints to its belief that we, the gullible public, must be protected from overly sexy, unhealthy or offensive images and ideas, the ASA is doing what every censor from Torquemada to Tony Blair has done: undemocratically controlling and curtailing the public sphere in the fake name of \"the greater good\".</p> <p>I would far rather be bombarded with messages from corporations that are at least honest about what they're doing \u2013 trying to sell us stuff \u2013 than have my eyes shielded by an ivory-tower quango that I have no control over.</p> <p>If the ASA is serious about respecting the minority viewpoint, then how about we get together 32 people (the number that successfully killed off the Cactus Kid) and demand the self-obliteration of the ASA? Any takers?</p>",
  "<p>Do people <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/05/police\">really want to join</a> an organisation that has racist tendencies and policies and repressive practices limiting progress and ambition? The London-based Black Police Association (BPA) clearly thinks not.</p> <p>Nine years on from the pivotal <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/Lawrence\">Lawrence inquiry</a> and its assertion that <a href=\"http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm42/4262/4262.htm\">\"institutional racism\" was endemic</a> in the British police, the professional Metropolitan Black Police Association began a boycott on Monday of recruitment to the Met. Its chairman, Alfred John, stated that it is boycotting all drives to attract black and minority ethnic recruits and staff to Britain's largest police service, claiming it would be wrong to encourage people to join a \"hostile and racist environment\".</p> <p>If black employees of the police service do not have any confidence in their own organisation to treat them with dignity and respect, it is almost impossible too for black communities themselves to have any trust or confidence. The paradox is that it had been historically argued and widely felt that black people joining the police were signing up to a profession that was racist to its core and symbolic of the regulation and control of black communities.</p> <p>Nothing seems to have changed from the Home Office research in 1999 entitled <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/prgpdfs/fprs107.pdf\">Career Progression of Ethnic Minority Police Officers</a>, which concluded that, in almost every aspect of career progression, black and minority ethnic officers had been discriminated against, retention of black officers had deteriorated, resignation was twice as likely among black officers compared with white officers and rates of dismissal were three times higher than for white officers. Only 3% of black officers and 1.9% of Asian officers had some experience of working in a specialist department compared with 9.1% of white officers.</p> <p>In 2003, Dr Nirmal Puwar produced a valuable piece of research into the experiences of black and minority ethnic women within the police service, highlighting how they suffered some overt but mainly subtle or latent forms of racism.</p> <p>She concluded that black and minority ethnic women, while located on the inside of the police, were at the same time outsiders occupying a tenuous position and facing issues of invisibility and visibility. Black and minority ethnic women were confined to core, front-desk or back-office policing roles, not specialist posts, and on average their pay was within the lower salary bands.</p> <p>In October 2003, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/oct/21/bbc.raceintheuk\">the BBC Panorama programme The Secret Policeman</a> demonstrated how individuals with overt racist views had managed to pass through both the recruitment and training process to join the police service in Manchester, allowing them to pursue their personal pernicious agenda.</p> <p>After the screening of The Secret Policeman, presented by the journalist Mark Daly, the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) announced that it would be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/oct/31/race.ukcrime\">formally investigating the police service</a> regarding its recruitment and training practices.</p> <p>By 2007, the CRE disappeared into the new Equalities and Human Rights Commission and its powerful formal investigation arm was lost forever.</p> <p>The post-Lawrence anti-racism training offered an ideal opportunity to root out a minority of police staff whose personal racism, in my opinion, was so dangerously high that they simply were not fit for operational policing duties.</p> <p>It was a missed opportunity because while the training was compulsory, it was not, as it should have been, a \"pass\" or \"fail\" course. Police trainers were powerless to address the explicit racism that they encountered and witnessed.</p> <p>In January 2004, the Metropolitan Police Authority announced its intention to hold an independent inquiry into professional standards and employment matters at the Met. The <a href=\"http://www.mpa.gov.uk/morrisinquiry/report/default.htm\">Morris inquiry</a> was meant to be a root and branch examination of the allegations of racism, victimisation and discrimination plaguing the Met and involving the treatment of black and minority ethnic officers. To most, it appears that the inquiry's outcomes and recommendations have simply been left to gather dust.</p> <p>In 2008, the range of abuse that black employees of the police service face include \"being sidelined\", \"left out of decision-making\", \"given tedious work rather than more challenging work\", \"not being selected for high-profile portfolios\", \"being made to feel useless, not valued, not appreciated and not utilised\", \"being pigeon-holed and straitjacketed into predetermined positions as a token gesture\", \"training opportunities, secondment and other career-enhancing opportunities being curtailed and limited\" \u2013 the list is endless.</p> <p>Black police staff, both officers and personnel, describe to me a police service that is designed to break you physically, mentally and spiritually.</p> <p>The latest BBC Panorama programme, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00f3ty2\">The Secret Policeman Returns</a>, has revealed widespread dissatisfaction among black and minority ethnic staff. In surveying BPA members, it found that 72% had experienced racism at work, 60% felt their career had been hindered by their ethnicity and 61% said things had stayed the same or got worse.</p> <p>The chief constable of Kent, Mike Fuller, Britain's first and only black chief constable, spoke for many when he stated that \"you have to work twice as hard (as your white counterpart) to compete.\"</p> <p>The public outcry over racism from senior Officers like the extremely talented, sharp and intelligent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/20/tarique.ghaffur.profile\">Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur</a> is just the tip of the iceberg. Consequently, it is not surprising that the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, in his flawed kneejerk response called for a not so \"independent inquiry\", albeit as an attempt to head off the BPA's formal boycott.</p> <p>The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, also understands the seriousness of the situation, hence her request for an immediate nationwide assessment of how black and minority ethnic employees are treated by the police.</p> <p>As a responsive service, it would be unfair and wrong to claim that there has been no progress within the Met since the Lawrence inquiry. Clearly there has been some, but I would argue this progress has always been a rearguard action.</p> <p>The police service has never really been able to lead from the front and inspire real change, new ways of thinking and operating, and despite having had one of the most liberal police commissioners to date, Sir Ian Blair, its organisational culture has fundamentally not changed.</p> <p>Challenging the terrorist agenda and the rise in violent crime involving children and young people allowed the police service to unite and park for a while the vexed issue of institutional racism. It returned to business as usual in the name of challenging terrorism and tackling \"youth murders\" \u2013 young black and Asian people were feeling the heat on the streets in more ways than one.</p> <p>However, the National Black Police Association, which had its roots in London, could not divert from its fundamental aim \"to seek to improve the working environment of black staff members with a view to enhancing the quality of service to black and minority ethnic communities in the UK\".</p> <p>It is this cause that would inevitably bring them into direct conflict with what is still widely regarded within the black community as \"the boot of the state\".</p> <p>In spite of the National BPA's motto, \"One voice, strength in unity\", the continued mistreatment by the police of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/19/1\">its president, Ali Dizaei</a>, is symbolic of the stranglehold that the state has on black communities and ultimately undermines the very existence of the NBPA.</p> <p>It is absolutely clear that those who experience racism first hand and have the courage to speak up and speak out are systematically vilified. Too little is being done to address the racism of those that operate at the frontline of policing and there is still much more work to be done to protect those vulnerable to discrimination and racism within the service and to stem the continued rise of those leaving in the face of discrimination.</p> <p>The police still have a long way to go in the whole area of recruitment, retention and progression and public confidence within the black community towards the police is still at an all-time low.</p> <p>Of course, the police service is not alone. Even the most progressive of organisations cannot tolerate being criticised for acts of institutional racism and discrimination and those that complain about such organisations are quickly silenced and shifted aside.</p> <p>Individuals are victimised and hounded out of their jobs. Senior managers and those in positions of power from across a wide range of organisations become indignant at the thought that they or their organisation could be accused of institutional racism. They cite such claims by their employees as an act of disloyalty which should only be rewarded by a swift boot up the arse, thus creating a climate of fear for those who dare to exercise their right to complain. </p> <p>The current racism row within the police service holds a mirror up to us all.<br>Radical action is needed in order for change to occur, so that those that have the courage to complain are adequately protected and those who suffer discrimination have proper opportunities for justice.</p>",

Clashing colours, punk prints and an uncontrolled junk aesthetic mark out both H&amp;M and Dover Street as breeding grounds for edgy street fashion.

All this presents a dilemma - whether to splash out on a statement cape that feels superhuman (see <a href=\"http://www.jaeger.co.uk/index.cfm?page=1094&amp;productid=700035N&amp;productvar=700035N-00100-M&amp;refpage=1622\">Jaeger's buttoned version</a> or <a href=\"http://www.my-wardrobe.com/berenger-check-cape-by-thomas-burberry\">Burberry's checked version</a>) or a cocoon that envelops you like a big hug (seen on Pringle and Stella McCartney's catwalks, with a similar take available from <a href=\"http://www.oasis-stores.com/fcp/product/Oasis/Coats/Int-true-cocoon-coat/4500017264\">Oasis</a>)? </p> <p>Or, in these credit crunch times, to hunker down in a more classic style that will last more than one winter? If so, you might well opt for a tailored, nipped-in waist or a military double-breasted style.</p> <h2>FASHIONISTA OF THE WEEK</h2> <p>After four weeks of transglobal jetsetting for fashion weeks, most fashionistas are either in bed or keeping a low profile this week. Not Lily Cole though, who instead of blending in quietly alongside her fellow freshers at Cambridge, has <a href=\"http://www.graziadaily.co.uk/fashion/archive/2008/10/01/just-in--lily-cole-s-playboy-cover.htm\">hit the headlines</a> for a rather pervy doll-like pin-up pose on the cover of French Playboy. That's one way to make friends around campus.</p> <h2>SILLY SPEAK</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338431551\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/10/09/Shootie140x84.jpg\" alt=\"Rupert Sanderson shoe / boot\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rupert Sanderson shootie</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still garnering rave reviews is the \"shootie\". That'll be a half-shoe half-bootie, of course, also known as the ankle grazer, or the horseshoe shoe, or in this month's Vogue, the stiletto boot (boring). It's a great accompaniment to black tights and a thigh-skimming microdress we hear, but seriously - someone must be having a tough time dreaming up these tenuous terms. Is there an endless supply of these daft fashion hybrids? Your suggestions on a postcard, please.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE WEEK</h2> <blockquote> <p>The thing is, conspicuous consumption was on its way out anyway; it had stopped being cool, unless you were a WAG or the wife of some oligarch and your definition of cool involved a Day-Glo orange tan and a lot of python skin. Truly stylish people have never splashed their cash, because ostentation is never elegant: it's vulgar and slightly naff.</p> </blockquote> <p>India Knight explains why the credit crunch shouldn't kill fashion in November's Marie Claire<br> </p> <h2>FASHION GRAVEYARD</h2> <p>RIP the Union Jack-wearing punk revivalist trend, as seen recently adorning an Alexander McQueen clutch and Agyness Deyn-alike.

  "<p>Jamie Foxx looks set to play a devastated husband and father who takes revenge on the killer of his wife and daughter in the psychological thriller Law Abiding Citizen.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/57129/shawshank.redemption\">Shawshank Redemption</a> director Frank Darabont will be taking charge of the project, which also stars Gerard Butler as a high-flying assistant district attorney.</p> <p>Foxx is in final negotiations to play a vigilante who sets out to take revenge on the murderer who stole his family from him. In the story, the killer is set free due to a plea bargain, a move which leaves Foxx's character devastated and seeking revenge. Butler's character is involved in the legal farrago which saw the criminal handed his get out of jail card. Butler's also producing through his Evil Twin company.</p> <p>Butler is currently on our screens in Guy Ritchie's gangster tale <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/125610/rocknrolla\">RocknRolla</a>, while Foxx will next appear in The Soloist, the new film from Joe Wright, director of Atonement. He plays a brilliant musician who finds himself living on the street due to mental health issues in the Oscar season tear jerker. </p> <p>In other Butler news, the Scots actor was yesterday being investigated for an alleged attack on a photographer. A spokesperson for the Los Angeles police department said an unnamed paparazzo had filed a report accusing the 38-year-old of punching him several times in the face in a scuffle early on Tuesday morning.</p>",
  "<p>The US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, has signalled that the government could invest in banks as it tries to contain the deepening <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">global crisis</a>, as Asian central banks joined in the unprecedented <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.marketturmoil1\">coordinated global rate cut</a>.</p> <p>Following the concerted interest rate cuts announced yesterday by several central banks, it appears that the US treasury is now considering taking stakes in many US banks. The news comes after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.marketturmoil1\">Britain announced a \u00a3500bn bank rescue package</a>, including \u00a350bn to buy stakes in its major banks. </p> <p>At a news conference in Washington, Paulson said that the federal government would use \"all resources at its disposal to make our financial system stronger\". </p> <p>\"We will use all of the tools we've been given to maximum effectiveness, including strengthening the capitalisation of financial institutions of every size.\"</p> <p>Striking a cautious tone that sent shares sliding on Wall Street, Paulson cautioned the US rescue plan will not save all firms. \"One thing we must recognize - even with the new treasury authorities, some financial institutions will fail,\" he said, adding that regulators will take measures to limit the systemic risk from any single bank failure.</p> <p>A degree of calm returned to the world's stockmarkets today. In London the FTSE 100 rose 93 points in early trading to 4459 points, a gain of 2.1%. Markets in Germany and France were also up, after Wall Street closed down 2% yesterday in another jittery session.</p> <p>UK banking shares led the risers in London, with HBOS up 27%, Royal Bank of Scotland gaining 20% and Lloyds TSB 10% higher.</p> <p>South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan all cut their domestic interest rates by a quarter point overnight. This followed yesterday's half-point cuts by the Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, with the UK base rate being lowered to 4.5% from 5% at midday yesterday.</p> <p>The financial crisis continued to ripple across Europe this morning. Iceland, which has been hit hard by the financial crisis, this morning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/09/banking.iceland\">took control of the country's biggest bank Kaupthing</a>. Iceland has now brought most of its banking sector under state control. Kaupthing's board resigned.</p> <p>The Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, said his government was prepared to buy stakes in failing banks while waiving voting rights. Italy has been largely shielded from the global financial turmoil because its banking sector is mostly retail, relying on savers' deposits rather than money markets. </p> <p>Germany may have to consider nationalising its banks if the crisis continues to worsen, finance minister Peer Steinbrueck told a newspaper. </p> <p>And in Asia, stockmarkets were mixed after quarter-point rate cuts in Seoul, Hong Kong and Taipei. Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 2.1% at 15762 and shares in Seoul edged up 0.6%, while Taiwan's index dropped 1.45% to 5130.</p> <p>\"Just lowering interest rates would be far from sufficient in the current situation,\" said Amar Gill at CLSA in Singapore. \"The main problem now is that banks are not lending to weaker banks, and the overall banking system is not lending to corporates.\" </p> <p>The Bank of Japan did not take part in the coordinated rate move, as its interest rates are already near zero, but the country's finance minister, Shoichi Nakagawa, welcomed the move. The Nikkei index closed down 0.5% at 9157.</p>",
  "<p>Coverage of the global financial meltdown in the wake of the credit crunch has tended to obscure reporting of events in the Middle East, a region apparently stuck in a never-ending political crunch. </p> <p>The build-up of more than 10,000 Syrian troops on the Lebanese border, nominally to \"stop smuggling\", a car bomb in Damascus, and continued fighting in and around the northern city of Tripoli, are all part of the continuing saga of poor relations between Syria and Lebanon since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/30/syria.unitednations\">2005 Syrian \"withdrawal\"</a> from Lebanese territory.</p> <p>Despite the incredible thaw in international relations with respect to Syria, including the possible offer of board membership of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Syria remains nominally in Washington's bad books. This was made clear in George Bush's speech at the United Nations last month, in which he said: \"A few nations \u2013 regimes like Syria and Iran \u2013 continue to sponsor terror, yet their numbers are growing fewer and they're growing more isolated from the world.\" </p> <p>Last week the bizarre story emerged of a US judge ordering Syria <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5g1iYvOov3NAy8y-ctyKh-wVi9BrQD93J8S780\">to pay $400m to families of contractors killed in Iraq</a>, accusing the country of supporting those in Iraq who carried out the killings. </p> <p>But with US officials now admitting to <a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-35805020081005\">a \"reconfiguration\" in policy</a> towards Syria, it is worth asking what those Syrian connections to the Iraqi insurgency and al-Qaida linked-groups actually are. </p> <p>The American military has consistently accused Syria of allowing al-Qaida fighters to cross into Iraq through its border. Yet the crux of the debate should be whether Syrian support for such groups is active or passive. Whereas Damascus's alliance with Hizbullah can be described as an active and largely stable relationship based on a rational strategy of non-conventional proxy attacks on their enemies, the blowback from supporting jihadis for a secular Ba'athist Syrian regime is an obvious danger. </p> <p>Yet links between Damascus and certain extremist groups have been proven. Shakir al-Absi, the commander of the fundamentalist Fatah al-Islam group that clashed with the Lebanese army in the battles of the Nahr al-Barid (the Palestinian refugee) camp in 2007, used to travel around Syria in total freedom.</p> <p>It seems that today, as the Damascus car bomb proved, other Islamist groups in Lebanon are being used back against Syria \u2013 in a form of tit-for-tat jihadi proxy-battle. Indeed Lebanon's leading cleric, Dai al-Islam al-Shahal, has warned Syria to stay out of north Lebanon or risk opening \"the gates of hell\". <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12342146\">The Economist</a> reported that \"after closing the borders, the Syrians got a message from the Salafists [Sunni jihadists]: you leave us alone or we target you\". </p> <p>These groups are said to have been supported by the anti-Syrian March 14 Alliance, headed by Saad Hariri, who called Syria \"a clear and direct threat\" to Lebanon. Yet he \"has been paying jihadis not to be jihadis but they've been rebelling against him\", according to Nadim Shehadi of Chatham House.</p> <p>Paradoxically, traditional American support for the March 14 anti-Syrian \u2013 and thus anti-Iranian \u2013 elements in Lebanon is thus linked to supporting al-Qaida-linked groups that the so-called war on terror is supposed to be directed against. </p> <p>Essentially Washington has found itself in a localised conflict with a bitter history that makes redundant policies such as \"with us or against us\". As the <a href=\"http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&amp;categ_id=2&amp;article_id=96482\">Lebanese Daily Star reported last week</a>, \"too many people in both Beirut and Damascus appear to be operating under a winner-take-all mentality that can only guarantee net losses for all concerned\". </p> <p>The Syrian regime feels an ownership of Lebanon that can almost be compared to its ally Russia's quasi-sovereign control of South Ossetia. Syria also believes that the high tide of US power in the Middle East arrived in 2005, when Syria was forced out of Lebanon, and has been in decline ever since. </p> <p>In 1990 Syria was granted de facto American support for its occupation of Lebanon in exchange for joining in the anti-Saddam coalition. Today the Syrians believe helping a weak US achieve the right conditions for withdrawal from Iraq \u2013 hence help sealing the Iraq-Syria border, achieving influence with the so-called Awakening of Sunni tribesmen, and so on \u2013 should come at a similar cost of accepting high levels of Syrian suzerainty over Lebanon. With the Hariri tribunal seemingly on the back burner and Syria actively courting its neighbours \u2013 including Israel \u2013 the US \"diplomatic reconfiguration\" may do just that.</p>",
  "<p>Want to hear a joke? An investment banker walks into a state-owned savings bank and hands over all his cash.</p> <p>You're not laughing? I bet the banker didn't look too joyous either when he deposited all his money in the much-maligned safe haven of German pensioners and petty savers. It's not a joke, by the way. Investment bankers were actually caught <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gbKv6wPwJ-cYL_rW2cZk6zGqAE6AD93LN0501\">opening savings accounts</a> at the Sparkasse in Frankfurt. It goes without saying that the new accounts are somewhat bigger than the ordinary customer's average deposit.</p> <p>The German system of private or cooperative savings banks and federal state banks has long been ridiculed by private bankers and investors. Communal institutions were the resort of the have-nots. But the financial world has been turned upside down. Even for the most adventurous gambler, security is the key these days.</p> <p>And the system offered by cooperative and savings banks is even safer than Chancellor Angela Merkel's full deposit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/06/europe.germany\">guarantee</a> last weekend. Unlike private banks, they give guarantees for deposits without any limit \u2013 because the institution guarantee stipulates that, if one bank is at risk of failure, the other banks have to step in to save it.</p> <p>Why should savers still trust private banks if even private bankers don't? Last Sunday, Merkel announced that all deposits are safe. But there won't be any law that would enable us to enforce this guarantee by legal action.</p> <p>It is not clear yet if an admittedly strongly worded promise will restore people's trust in the safety of their savings. Who can blame those who withdraw their money and carry it to savings banks or hide it under their pillow?</p> <p>Germany is still struggling for a comprehensive answer to the crisis, and even has difficulties dealing with individual cases. Conflicting statements in the case of <a href=\"http://www.hyporealestate.com\">Hypo Real Estate</a> don't show any sign of a confidence-building crisis management. Now Hypo is even calling for an investigation into whether the minister of finance, Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, is partly to blame for the bank's misery, the Financial Times Deutschland reports. Steinbr\u00fcck had said that billions of euros in guarantees should enable the bank to be \"wound down in an orderly manner\".</p> <p>Meanwhile, the strongest advocates of the free-market economy agree that only the state can stop the downward slide of the financial markets. The European Central Bank and central banks worldwide joined the global rescue team by lowering interest rates. Germany is watching whether Britain's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/marketturmoil.creditcrunch\">\u00a350bn bail-out plan</a> succeeds with great interest. Every rescue plan that goes up in smoke will only add to the lack of trust.</p> <p>Investment bankers might have found their personal last resort in the secure deposits of communal savings banks. But the feeling in Germany is that it would be disastrous if the markets lost trust in the state as the lender of last resort.</p>",
  "<p>I am rolling south. As my train crosses postcodes and county lines I am filled with a nebulous sense of regret that expands each mile farther I go from my cottage and my desk. But what are train journeys for, if not for writing? </p> <p>Well, as I was reminded, they make great listening posts too. Last week I overheard the following: \"Look buddy, I'm sorry, I just got hitched and my mother-in-law and her people are over from China, there's no way I can make it\u2026 sure I'll be on at 6, and yes, we'll do the rock'n'roll bagpipes \u2026 I'll try and find you someone else for the other slot \u2026 but I'm telling you, pipers don't get outta bed for less than \u00a3200 \u2026 believe me I used to be a pro, it takes time to get tartaned-up \u2026 I might know someone who can do it ... gimme an hour.\"</p> <p>The man, somewhere between pro-wrestler and college professor (braces, Oxford bags, beard, Bronx accent, impressive bulk), then proceeded to make a call to a dive bar in Soho asking for 'Joe the Killer', a toastmaster of some repute, I later learned. </p> <p>Trains allow us to move unnoticed through places and conversations, to eavesdrop with impunity. They allow us to be in the world but not of it, unlike the poet <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/learning/getwritingni/wh_macneice.shtml\">Louis MacNeice</a>, himself no stranger to trains, who was once described as \"in the bar but not of it\". They let us absorb the speech patterns and registers of others, to slip for a moment into their modes of thought. (Am I alone in thinking the above might have been code for something more unsavoury than \"rock'n'roll bagpipes\"?)</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoem.do?poemId=7108\">Philip Larkin's Whitsun Weddings</a> the movement of a train lends to the poet's eye something of the camera lens, allowing him to observe with his trademark alacrity and precision a nation teetering on the brink of happiness. So on trains, in perception at least, we are lent a movement and partial-omnipotence usually reserved for the lesser gods or film directors with big budgets. We are gifted establishing shots, cut-aways, close-ups, our visual repertoire is extended as we keep up with a flock of starlings, or outpace the weather system moving in from the west. </p> <p>We see the backs of terraces where bicycles rust and how quickly districts move from gentrified to slum-like. In effect we short-circuit our usual way of perceiving the world; and this is exactly what good poems can do: make the usual unusual, strange, compelling. </p> <p>There is a kind of cordiality that persists on cross-country trains. You couldn't sit on a bendy bus down Oxford Street without fearing your laptop might be swiped or your listening-in taken the wrong way. For better or worse, on weekdays at least, the train carriage finds its natural analogy in the library. </p> <p>It is more your local lending library - complete with screaming kids, anoraks and that faint, pervasive and unplaceable smell \u2013 than the London Library. For that you have to upgrade, its source of melancholy captured in <a href=\"http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.asp?id=15001\">Paul Farley's 'From a Weekend First' in his collection The Ice Age</a>.</p> <p>But trains sit deeper in the poet's psyche; they become freighted with meanings both sublimated and exposed \u2013 think of some of Don Paterson's poems in God's Gift to Women, where the train becomes the vehicle for, what Roland Barthes might call, the poet's image-repertoire for a failing love affair. </p> <p>I have a hunch about why trains outstrip planes and cars as a premier source of inspiration for travelling poets: poets are notoriously bad drivers. Planes were never in the running really: we are too poor to fly with any frequency though Colette Bryce ends her second collection with an almost <a href=\"http://www.thepoem.co.uk/poems/bryce.htm\">pitch-perfect description of a plane landing</a> and <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E0DA1530F933A15757C0A9679C8B63\">Seamus Heaney's Known World</a> is a classic of that tiny genre known as Eastern bloc literary festival inflight-smoking poems. </p> <p>I was told recently of a poet who was listing all the poets in his university department who were non-drivers. When he came to the sole member who could drive, he noted: \"Of course, he can but he shouldn't be allowed to.\" That should probably stand as a universal instruction to us all, in case we miss what Larkin calls the \"frail travelling coincidence\" that lies just outside the window.</p>",
  "<p>Leftwing weekly Tribune plans to close on October 31 if a buyer cannot be found for the troubled 71-year-old publication, MediaGuardian.co.uk can reveal. </p> <p>The paper's management was unable to secure the extra investment it wanted from its trade union owners this week and has decided to sell or close the title rather than \"run it into the ground\".</p> <p>If a buyer cannot be found Tribune's last issue will be published on October 31. </p> <p>A source close to the publication described it as an \"amicable separation\" and said unions were optimistic that a buyer could be found. Several buyers are understood to have expressed an interest. </p> <p>The Tribune editor, Chris McLaughlin, warned on the magazine's website last week that the publication was \"in imminent danger of becoming silent\".</p> <p>He said the magazine's trade union owners - who took control of Tribune in 2004 - would face \"a decision that could cease publication within weeks\".</p> <p>\"The current political situation - not to mention the domination of the British media by rightwing proprietors - absolutely demands the continued existence of Tribune,\" wrote McLaughlin. </p> <p>Tribune is owned by a consortium of trade unions including Unison, Amicus and Aslef, who took over the title in 2004. </p> <p>McLaughlin said the magazine had been transformed from \"terminal decline\" to a position of \"rising circulation, reduced running costs and a significantly reduced monthly loss\".</p> <p>But he said extra investment was required to ensure its \"sustained growth and development and allay the ongoing burden of historic debt\".</p> <p>McLaughlin said if the increased resources were not forthcoming, the title should be closed \"to avoid running the magazine into the ground and an enforced closure by debtors\".</p> <p>\"It will cost up to \u00a3170,000 to close Tribune,\" he said. \"It currently costs \u00a350,000 to run it for a year with no promotions budget.</p> <p>\"The business plan called for \u00a3200,000 over two years with a break-even target and increased growth beyond. This is a small investment when the present and future roles of Tribune are examined.\"</p> <p>McLaughlin warned: \"The political cost of losing Tribune, for want of a comparatively small investment, would be incalculable.

  "<p>Media companies are becoming less willing to fight defamation court cases all the way to a verdict, according to a study by a leading legal publisher.</p> <p>According to research by the Reuters group-owned Sweet &amp; Maxwell of more than 250,000 online law reports and transcripts, 61% of all reported defamation cases over the 12 months until May this year resulted in a \"statement in open court\". </p> <p>This was up from 56% of cases over the same period in 2006/7 and just 21% of cases in 2004/5.</p> <p>The research also shows a steady increase in the share of cases featuring celebrities, which have almost doubled as a percentage of reported cases from 17% in 2004/5 to 32% in 2007/8. </p> <p>The report's authors suggested that the increase reflected a strong appetite among consumers for celebrity stories from print, broadcast and online media but that \"competition to deliver this coverage can lead to factual errors being made which then prompt defamation claims\".</p> <p>The report throws the spotlight on the increasing use of Conditional Fee Agreements (CFAs) by litigants in defamation cases, which increases the financial risks involved in defending a case.<br> CFAs enable lawyers to take libel cases against newspapers on a no-win, no-fee basis which means that if they win they can charge the losing side up to twice their normal hourly fee at a rate of up to \u00a3800 an hour. Caroline Kean of law firm Wiggin, which was not involved in compiling the report, said: \"There is no doubt that the use of CFAs is having a chilling effect on the media, and the whole system needs a thorough review. Defendants are choosing the ground upon which they will fight a case to trial much more carefully. </p> <p>\"With the burden of proof effectively resting on the defendant, they are forced to enter into settlement negotiations in some cases before they have necessarily had a chance to test the claim, if they are to contain the costs that the claimant's solicitors will seek to recover from being totally out of all proportion to the value of the claim.\"</p> <p>Jaron Lewis, the head of media at City law firm Reynolds Porter Chamberlain LLP, said: \"The number of libel cases continues to fall, even though there is now more media content published than ever before.</p> <p>\"The media is now much more used to interacting with its audience and dealing with complaints as they arise. Also, media companies are now under more pressure than ever before to settle cases because of the potential costs of fighting a case through to trial.\"</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

Can I safely get rid of it?</em><br><strong>Peter Paul </strong></p> <p>You should be able to remove NoAdware with the Control Panel's Add/Remove Programs utility.

To avoid confusion, I do recommend Adblock Plus, which is a Firefox browser extension, and Lavasoft's Ad-Aware, but I don't recommend NoAdware.<br></p>"
