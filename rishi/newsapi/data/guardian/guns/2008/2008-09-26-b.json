  "<p>The government's 42 days counterterrorism legislation came under fresh fire last night when a former director general of MI5 said the provision to hold suspects for six weeks without charge was excessive.</p> <p>Dame Stella Rimington became the second former MI5 chief in three months to come out against the controversial measures. \"It's too much, quite frankly,\" she said when asked about the 42-day limit during a talk in London about her new spy thriller novel. While she was uncertain what the right limit was, it was clear to her that 42 days was too long.</p> <p>Rimington, who became the first woman director general of MI5 in 1992 and held the post until her retirement in 1996, also attacked the US-led \"war on terror\" for sending the wrong message and said that the treatment of prisoners at Guant\u00e1namo Bay had been very damaging. \"If there was a moral high ground, Guant\u00e1namo has lost it,\" she told an audience at the Crime Scene festival where she was launching her novel, Dead Line.</p> <p>The 42-day plan faces rejection when it goes to the House of Lords after the summer recess, guaranteeing a bruising round of parliamentary \"ping pong\" in which the counterterrorism bill will travel back and forth between the Lords and Commons if the government insists on the plan.</p> <p>Dominic Grieve, the shadow home secretary, who is strongly opposed to the measure, tells the Guardian today that he expects it to be rejected by peers. \"I'm not a member of the House of Lords and I can't tell their lordships what to do. But my impression is that the chances of the bill getting through in its current form in the House of Lords are low. And it's very likely that the House of Lords will remove the proposal for 42 days altogether, which is what we would support.\"</p> <p>Two months ago, another former head of MI5, Lady Manningham-Buller, used her maiden speech in the Lords to attack the plans. She opposed them on a \"practical basis as well as a principled one\".</p> <p>A critical report from the all-party Lords constitution committee, which includes the former lord chief justice Lord Woolf and former Labour attorney general Lord Morris of Aberavon, said the draft bill risked undermining the independence of judges and the chances of a fair trial for suspects. Other notable opponents of the legislation include Sir Ken MacDonald, the director of public prosecutions, who sees no reason to extend beyond 28 days. Lord Goldsmith, former attorney general, warned that it would undermine fundamental British freedoms.</p> <p>The former head of MI5 said that a \"war on terror\" gave the false impression that aspirations could be achieved by military action. In fact, she said, a combination of policing, intelligence gathering and diplomacy was far more likely to succeed than force of arms. Terrorism should be treated as a crime, she said, as it was in the UK. \"With the 'war on terror', the United States has gone down the wrong line,\" she added.</p> <p>Asked about the introduction of ID cards, another key element of the government's security strategy, she said that \"they [ID cards] won't make us safer.\"</p>",
  "<p>American lawmakers inched closer to a deal on a $700bn bail-out of America's teetering banking industry last night after a day of political wrangling complicated by the involvement of presidential rivals John McCain and Barack Obama.</p> <p>Congressional leaders pledged they would work through the weekend to find common ground, after Republicans defied their president by walking away from an initial agreement, fearing a voter backlash over the cost of rescuing Wall Street banks.</p> <p>McCain had threatened on Wednesday to boycott the first presidential debate with Obama in Oxford, Mississippi, last night, but backed off at midday yesterday. He flew from Washington to Oxford for the debate, as did Obama.</p> <p>Both presidential candidates are scheduled to return to Washington afterward. A rescue deal is unlikely until they return, with both parties keen to have their presidential candidates take credit - even if their roles were peripheral.</p> <p>Last night, Gordon Brown said he was backing the bail-out after talks with Bush at the White House. Bush said: \"The prime minister wants to know if the plan is big enough to make a difference, and if it is going to be passed, I told him it is big enough to make a difference, and it is going to be passed.\"</p> <p>Brown responded: \"Britain supports the plan. Whatever the details, it is the right thing to do to take us through these circumstances. America deserves the support of the rest of the world\".</p> <p>After initially falling sharply, shares on Wall Street surged on hopes that an emergency package would be finalised. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 121 points at 11,143.</p> <p>The fresh impetus came after a stalemate on Thursday when McCain and Obama joined talks at the White House.</p> <p>Democrats accused McCain of grandstanding in Washington without playing a useful part in shaping the bail-out. Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, said McCain's presence had been \"harmful\" rather than helpful: \"All he has done is stand in front of the cameras. We still don't know where he stands on this particular issue.\"</p> <p>McCain's campaign team said he had only agreed to go ahead with the debate because he was optimistic that significant progress had been made towards a deal. Obama told the press on his plane to Mississippi that progress on the bail-out legislation was being made. \"I look forward to, after the debate, coming back to Washington and hopefully getting the package done,\" he said.</p> <p>A tentative agreement struck on Thursday evaporated after a revolt by House Republicans.</p> <p>With their resolve apparently bolstered by McCain's involvement, these Republicans came up with an entirely redrawn proposal which would require troubled banks to purchase state-sponsored insurance for bad debts rather than selling \"toxic\" mortgage-backed securities to the treasury.</p> <p>The treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, who spent much of the day locked in negotiations with members of Congress, expressed reservations about meeting the rebels' demands, including for restrictions on pay-outs for failed executives.</p> <p>Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the Senate banking committee, said the bail-out in its original form was unacceptable. \"They're trying to push this in an emotional state, saying the sky's falling on our heads,\" he said. \"Every time we have rushed to judgment in the past, we have paid for it.\"</p> <p>But calls for urgent action were joined by two of America's most venerable economic figures. Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman and George Shultz, the Reagan-era treasury secretary, published an open letter saying: \"We urgently advocate immediate, extensive action that would maintain the functions of credit markets and prevent a serious economic contraction.\"</p>",
  "<p>Metallica's ninth studio album, Death Magnetic, may be topping the charts, but some fans are signing <a href=\"http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/re-mix-or-remaster-death-magnetic.html\">an online petition</a> that asks the band to re-mix the album and release it again. The problem is the usual one: it has been mixed to sound loud, which has crippled the dynamic range. As one fan says, \"Sonically it is barely listenable,\" according to a report in <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122228767729272339.html\">The Wall Street Journal</a>. The paper says:<br><br></p> <blockquote> <p>Metallica and the album's producer, Rick Rubin, declined to comment. Cliff Burnstein, Metallica's co-manager, says the complainers are a tiny minority. He says 98% of listeners are \"overwhelmingly positive,\" adding: \"There's something exciting about the sound of this record that people are responding to.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>However, Ted Jensen, who mastered the album, emailed one complaining fan to say: \"Believe me, I'm not proud to be associated with this one.\"</p> <blockquote> <p>Mr Jensen regrets his choice of words but not the sentiment. \"I'm not sure I would have said quite the same thing if I was posting it to the bulletin board,\" he says. But \"it's certainly the way I feel about it.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>This is, as the Journal says, a long-running argument. I raised it here in 2006 with a post that said <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2006/oct/02/cdmasteringis\">CD mastering is killing music</a>, with reference to a cover story by Joe Gross in XL Recording Studio Guide 2006: <a href=\"http://www.austin360.com/music/content/music/stories/xl/2006/09/28cover.html\">Everything Louder Than Everything Else</a>. I also linked to a paper (<a href=\"http://www.tcelectronic.com/media/lund_2004_distortion_tmt20.pdf\">PDF</a>) with a historical list of CDs and the amount of excess compression they used.</p> <p>(Note: the problem is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_level_compression\">audio level compression</a> -- raising the average sound level -- not <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_data_compression\">audio data compression</a>. Most people experience it when it's used to make TV adverts sound much louder than TV programmes.)</p> <p>In January 2007, the topic was taken up by Tim Anderson in a Technology section story, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/jan/18/pop.music\">How CDs are remastering the art of noise</a>, where remastering engineer Steve Hoffman explained how it could be done: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"A lot of signal processing is in the mastering stage, the type of processing that was almost impossible in the old days of analogue,\" says Hoffman. \"Now you have digital workstations which mercilessly zap all the dynamics out of music. The other problem is overuse of equalisation (EQ). Equalisation done digitally is very harsh, and most mastering engineers tend to overuse it. You just crank up the EQ and then you compress it digitally so everything sounds like a machine gun, and then it all sounds really loud.</p> <p>\"Unfortunately, once the dynamics are shaved off music, it's impossible to get them back,\" says Hoffman. \"It doesn't matter what volume you're playing at. When everything is loud, it doesn't sound loud any more. The only way that something can sound loud is if there's something quiet that precedes it, or else there's no frame of reference.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>The problem is, that: \"Over the years, rock and pop artists have increasingly sought to make their recordings sound louder to stand out on the radio, jukeboxes and, especially, iPods,\" says the WSJ. And in my experience, the more music is mastered to sound loud on very limited music systems, the worse it sounds when you play it back on decent hi-fi. </p> <p>And if people only listen to music mastered to sound loud on very limited music systems, how are they supposed to know what it could -- and should -- sound like?</p> <p>Well, the Metallica petition has an amusing comment:</p> <blockquote> <p>Having heard samples from Guitar Hero 3, it is clear that something can be done to redeem this album. The album sounds 100x better on a video game than it does on CD or vinyl! Welcome to 2008!</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>The bad press the oil industry receives could mean it's overlooked by students narrowing down career options, but companies have been cleaning up their act, and with high oil prices there has perhaps never been a better time to explore the options. For those with engineering and science backgrounds, the industry provides a wealth of opportunities, and a wealth of cash. Petroleum engineers working in larger companies, for example, can command starting salaries of \u00a329,000, and could see their earnings top \u00a390,000 during their careers. Add to that the opportunities to travel and were not just talking trips out to the North Sea and a career in the oil industry could be a gas.</p> <h2>An employer says</h2> <p><strong>Mike Wagstaff, chief executive Venture Production plc</strong></p> <p>(<a href=\"http://www.venture-production.com\">venture-production.com</a>)</p> <p>We take on graduates for subsurface positions: geologists, petroleum geoscientists, reservoir engineers the people who tell us how much oil and gas is underground, where it is and how best to get it out.</p> <p>We recruit graduates with at least a masters, and I think it's pretty much the same across the industry. I studied mechanical engineering and it was hard to get into the oil industry with just an undergraduate degree. I had to get a masters, but there are plenty of companies that offer sponsorship to do it. They are largely vocational courses, designed to get you into the industry.</p> <p>Most of our graduates are based in the office, but will go out to meet people offshore. The great thing about the industry is it can be incredibly technical and theoretical, but it has to be grounded in practice because we have to get the oil and gas out of the ground.</p> <p>The oil and gas industry has not got a great reputation; it's seen as nasty, dirty and polluting, but its still pretty fundamental. We need it to turn the lights on, to turn the heating on and to drive our cars. As consumers, we never see or touch the product we produce. The only gas we see is when its burning in the cooker; we don't see petrol. The product is sold into a commodity market where the price is set by whats going on in the world. It doesnt have the same touch point with customers, so the industry tends to be a bit more internally focused. We dont do enough to promote what we do.</p> <h2>A university says</h2> <p><strong>Quentin Fisher, professor of petroleum geoengineering, Centre for Integrated Petroleum Engineering and Geoscience, School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds</strong> (<a href=\"http://leeds.ac.uk\">leeds.ac.uk</a>)</p> <p>Our BEng in petroleum engineering is designed to provide undergraduates with core skills in the process engineering, geology and geophysics disciplines as well as more specialised topics in petroleum extraction and refining. Overall, we hope to provide students with a diverse education that will enable them to work effectively within the multidisciplinary teams that they are likely to join within the oil industry.</p> <p>Petroleum engineers can have a very diverse background. For example, it is extremely common to meet engineers whose first degree, MSc or PhD is in subjects such as mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, physics, astrophysics, or maths. Most people working in the industry will have a masters or PhD, and will undergo extensive training when they first join.</p> <p>There is a huge demand for petroleum engineering staff within the oil industry, and the overall trend in oil prices is likely to be upwards for the foreseeable future. Oil has become a high-value resource, where, increasingly, specialist solutions are needed in both extraction and processing. We believe that the jobs market for petroleum engineers will remain buoyant for many years to come.</p> <p>Career prospects in the field of petroleum engineering are excellent and well-qualified engineers can command high salaries soon after graduating. However, long-term career prospects would definitely benefit by undertaking a higher degree before entering the petroleum industry.</p> <h2>A graduate says</h2> <p><strong>Poonum Parmar, reservoir engineer, Shell </strong>(<a href=\"http://shell.co.uk\">shell.co.uk</a>)</p> <p>I work in the Aberdeen office and my role is to find out if we are using the oil fields to their full potential. I'm looking at what opportunities exist and how we can optimise them in the best possible way to get the maximum value out of the fields.</p> <p>I've visited a rig in the North Sea, which was fantastic. You're out at sea and you suddenly see this big lump of metal, which was overwhelming.</p> <p>I graduated in chemical engineering, which is slightly different from the degree you really need for reservoir engineering, but the training you get here pretty much puts you in good stead.</p> <p>At university I was given the opportunity to go to Bosnia for charity, a project Shell sponsored, so I developed a relationship with the company. I became their campus representative and did an internship, so my interest in the oil industry was progressive.</p> <p>When my graduate scheme finishes, I want to work overseas. I'd like to go to Canada or Asia. I'd like to get more offshore experience, have a go at the dirty stuff.</p>",
  "<p>Tilda Swinton sways onto the stage sleek and trim, her hair in a sandy bob, looking every bit the dapper returning Cambridge University alumnus. On the screen behind her, we've just watched her transformation from glam bar tramp to a flame-haired child kidnapper and \u2013 by extension, somehow \u2013 haphazard gangbuster, careening across the wastelands of southern California and through the border into the flesh market of Tijuana.</p> <p>\"I'm very lazy \u2013 I prefer to be in every frame of a film,\" she tells the Saturday night audience, out for the film's premiere at the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2008/sep/24/festivals\">Cambridge Film festival</a> \u2013 and here she all but got her wish. The film is called simply <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903627/\">Julia</a>, and it's an actor's proverbial tour de force, the \"filigree work\" she says an actor can do when she's shooting every scene. The director, Eric Zonca, has what she calls \"a zoological approach\" to his characters, \"like David Attenborough following a dung beetle.\"</p> <p><br>Julia is a drunk, and her permanently spinning head is the reason why she fails to recognise the evident craziness of an AA acquaintance's plan to kidnap her long-lost son. \"Drunks in cinema are usually losers, with this opium vibe,\" Swinton says. \"I think it takes energy, wit and verve to be an alcoholic.\"</p> <p>It's a no-brainer that the kidnap is botched, but Zonca doesn't especially play it for laughs or thrills. Mainly it seems an attempt to keep up with its protagonist: the film is an erratic odyssey through overworked genre terrain, holding to no promise except that maybe Julia will somehow come true. I'm not sure it quite gets there \u2013 the film feels too long and too short; Zonca apparently shot a four-hour film before whittling it down to its current 140 minutes \u2013 but it has some of the rawness of a film whose production followed the path of its storyline. \"It was the kind of shoot where Eric would say, \"You see that traffic? Go into it now\",\" Swinton merrily recalls.</p> <p>She built up her body for the role \u2013 \"covered in waist, with these fantastic tits\" \u2013 but the backers, Studio Canal, cut the budget by a third one month before the shoot, and the resulting pressures thinned her right back down by the end \u2013 not inappropriately. \"Don't tell Studio Canal!\" she tells us.</p> <p>Was she channelling <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2006/may/22/cannes2006.cannesfilmfestival2\">Gena Rowlands</a> in Cassavetes' very comparable <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080798/\">Gloria</a>? Sure, there's a woman, a gun, a boy with curly hair, but the internet rumour that this was a remake was not true, she says. Cassavetes' films \"are about people, relationships, something theatrical in the universe; Zonca isn't on the same page. He loves performances, honesty, alcoholism. I think there's more <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/artblog/2008/may/26/nangoldinsphotographicwork\">Nan Goldin</a> in the film. I had Nan's images on the wall of my trailer.\"</p> <p>Grievous to tell, this is Zonca's first film since 1998's <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120449/\">The Dream Life of Angels</a> and its featurette off-shoot, Le Petit Voleur. Even in France, it seems, the funding climate is now very different from when Swinton first worked her way up in Derek Jarman's mercurial streak of art films in the late 80s and early 90s, funded by the since-disbanded BFI Production Board. The festival has been screening some of these in its Jarman tribute, including a new HD print of his precious War Requiem on its twentieth anniversary, and Isaac Julien's requiem to Jarman himself, made this year with Swinton's own \"letter to Derek\" delivered at the Edinburgh Film Festival a few years ago.</p> <p>Those times are now past, but she thinks Julia may mark another transition in her own work, towards a more European cinema. \"There's a limit to the amount I can fake it in America,\" she says. And she's thinking ahead: a lapel badge says \"8\", the name of her new foundation which aims to widen British children's access to cinema beyond the confines of television and the multiplex. She and her co-founder Mark Cousins want to build up a catalogue of films from which children can choose a title to widen their horizons on their eighth birthday \u2013 before it's too late, as it were. \"If they can get to see a certain kind of cinema by that age,\" she reckons, \"it will stand them in good stead\u2026\"</p> <p>\u2022 Julia is released on December 5.</p>",

  "<p>New research published this week lifts the lid on just how hopeless many students are when it comes to money. </p> <p>The study by the UK's main financial watchdog found that one in three students are constantly overdrawn; two in five admit to being \"completely disorganised\" about their money; and one in three never check their bank statements - or, if they do, they only check the final balance. </p> <p>That is why, as the new university term begins, the Financial Services Authority says an army of money advisers will be sent to higher education colleges to help young people get a grip on their finances. </p> <p>The FSA says it wants to educate students about managing their debts and avoiding getting into difficulties. It has set its sights on introducing its Money Doctors financial education programme to dozens more universities this year. So far, the watchdog has helped train 100 money advisers at 50 universities across the UK, and it hopes to double that number this year. </p> <p>While the number of students who ignore their personal finances is probably representative of the wider population, a growing number of students are in debt to banks. </p> <p>The average student debt, according to Barclays, is about pounds 16,000. Debt campaigners have predicted that by 2010 students will have average debts of more than pounds 30,000. Rent rises and the soaring cost of heating and food have pushed many into financial hardship.</p> <p>Chris Pond, the FSA's director of financial capability, says rises in interest rates on loans and credit cards have proved especially costly for students who relied on debt to fund their studies.</p> <p>\"The FSA's Money Doctors programme is a new approach to financial education and seeks to address some of the causes of student financial problems. Our research shows that young people are least able to manage their finances, and this is why much of our work targets this group.\" </p> <p>The FSA kicked off the project at Roehampton University in 2005. By 2011, the FSA aims to make sure all 168 higher education institutions in Britain are aware of, and hopefully using, the Money Doctors toolkits and training available. </p> <p>Earlier this month, HSBC launched an interactive student advice website, talkingmoney.hsbc.co.uk, which it says is designed to give students and recent graduates an opportunity to share their experiences online and to advise on pressing issues such as finding part-time work and the importance of budgeting. </p> <p>At a time when the cost of living is on the rise, students are increasingly turning to part-time employment to cover expenses while at college. <br>The National Union of Students recently released research showing that around three in four students rely on part-time jobs to help make ends meet. But the typical work they take on - in bars, restaurants and weekend work <br>in shops - could become harder to find as more employers feel the pinch of the credit crunch and cut back on staff. </p> <p>\"So students who are going to rely on part-time work need to really think about the likelihood of finding that job and what they might do for money if they lose it,\" says the bank.</p>",
  "<h2>Job hunters pick pay and perks over ethics</h2> <p>Forget job satisfaction and the chance to travel and corporate social responsibility. In this time of fiscal turbulence, graduates are looking at pay and perks when it comes to deciding where they'd like to work. The findings of a survey carried out by Personnel Today debunked the theory that young people select employers on the basis of their social values, rather than the salaries they offer. Two thirds said pay was most important, while 85% said they would like their employer to offer cash as a performance incentive. Just one in five said having a pension was very important to them when it came to finding work. David Fairhurst, chief people officer at McDonald's, told Personnel Today: \"Employers think young people are cocky, confident and questioning, but the reality is they are the most needy generation of all.\"</p> <h2>More graduates than jobs, say researchers</h2> <p>Things are set to get worse for this needy bunch, as research conducted by the Confederation of British Industry found that universities were producing too many graduates. The research, published last week, found there were 10.1 million graduates, but only nine million graduate-level jobs. Final-year students beginning their job search now should take heed of the comments made by the CBI director general, Richard Lambert. He complained that too many graduates were poor communicators. Some even lacked the ability to get up in the morning, which, frankly, we blame on the decline in morning television.</p> <h2>Don't inflate your CV, Onrec warns</h2> <p>Despite these difficult times, graduates, and students looking for term-time work, have been warned against inflating their CVs. The Onrec website said people tended to over-egg their achievements when times get tough. The organisation said job hunters typically lie about previous experience, job titles, salaries and education background all things that employers can now easily check up on. Advice to graduates is to spend time scrutinising your CV for grammatical errors oh, and clean up your Facebook page.</p> <h2>PhD students move in to showcase ecohome</h2> <p>Two PhD students who have their work cut out in a different way are Deborah Adkins and Nina Hormazabal, who will be spending the next year in an ecohome researching energy efficient designs, construction techniques and technologies used to build and equip sustainable homes. The University of Nottingham students are living in the energy-efficient house, the first of six planned at the university to showcase green buildings of the future.</p>",
  "<p>Looking down 1,000m of untracked powder, we felt like we'd struck gold. It was a perfect blue sky day and I had just carved lines down my first face of the week. The valley was deserted apart from our small group and our fresh tracks were the only ones in sight. This was skiing at its best, the snow flying over our heads as we flew over little drop-offs and scouted tight couloirs below. It had been a week since the last snowfall, and all the big resorts' runs, and even their off-piste areas, were skied out. Yet here, in Switzerland's little-known Val d'Anniviers, we were still finding secret expanses of glorious untouched snow. </p> <p>All skiers agonise about where the best powder might be - poring over last year's statistics, watching the webcams and trying to figure out where the white stuff will pile up - but it is always a gamble. What seasoned skier hasn't turned up in a resort to find green grass on the lower pistes and bare ice at the top, only to hear that just the other side of the mountain it's snowing buckets? </p> <p>But a new holiday concept is shortening the odds of this happening, as long as you don't mind an element of surprise. Launched last season, Mountain Guide Travel's new \"Best skiing at the moment\" package, the brainchild of Swedish mountain guide Andreas Bengtsson, leaves the decision of which resort to ski until the 11th hour. You simply book the guide for the week (on your own or in groups of up to six), book a flight to Geneva, then wait until the day before your arrival to hear where you'll be going. The destination can be anywhere within a 4\u00bd-hour drive of Geneva; a radius that spans Switzerland, the French Alps, the Austrian Tyrol and northern Italy.</p> <p>I joined one of Andreas's groups last January, after excellent early snowfalls followed by a short barren patch. At the last minute, a storm blew itself out over Germany, meaning no fresh snow in the Alps and a difficult decision for Andreas. After speaking to his scouts around the Alps he decided on Switzerland's Valais region, where there would still be a fair amount of powder. But his role didn't end when he'd decided which area to take us to; throughout the week he was in pursuit of the best snow. </p> <p>I met the rest of the group - Rhys, Rod, Barney and Sam - at the H\u00f4tel de la Poste in Martigny, a small ancient town in the Lower Valais with transport connections to Chamonix, the Four Valleys and Portes-du-Soleil. Having arrived the day before me, they were already singing Andreas's praises. \"This guy is a ferret, he can sniff out fresh snow at a thousand paces,\" said Barney. \"Today everything over 2,200m was windblown, and everything under 1,500m had melted and refrozen, so we stayed between those altitudes and skied fresh tracks all day.\"</p> <p>The next day we headed out to the little-known resort of St Luc, a virtually deserted corner of the Val d'Anniviers, with skiing up to 2,950m and fantastic views across to the 4,000m-plus peaks of the Matterhorn and the Weisshorn.</p> <p>I soon learned why Barney was so impressed. It hadn't snowed for a week, but our Swedish powder-hound had the scent of fresh snow in his nostrils. Our first run was impeccable. The steeper sections were too crunchy, so we cut wide turns across rolling terrain just above the tree line. </p> <p>After a few runs we stopped off at the Cabane Bella Tola, an old stone refuge with glorious views across the valley, for a weissbier and a tartiflette. We then headed up to the steeper couloirs, the headline-grabbing terrain that we had been eyeing up all morning. We wanted to jump into the first one we saw, but Andreas had other ideas. We skirted across the ridge line until we came out to a perfect funnel, a long straight chute that gradually opened out. There was room for everyone to make fresh tracks, and a starting gradient of over 40 degrees appeased our gnarlier desires.</p> <p>Martigny is ideal for this kind of trip, a short drive from many different resorts and only 20 minutes from Verbier. While Andreas prefers to check out less well-known ski areas, he is also capable of tracking down fresh powder a week after a snowfall even in such a crowded resort as Verbier. </p> <p>The next day we caught the gondola from the valley base of Le Ch\u00e2ble and headed to the top of the Mont Fort glacier. Every piste was completely skied out, but we headed straight over the back of the summit into a steep couloir for the first fresh tracks of the day. To get any more meant skinning up 500m of vertical for 1\u00bd hours to the peak of Grand Mont Calme, using skins and touring bindings we'd hired in the village. </p> <p>Half-way up we stopped for a picnic lunch on the shoulder of a mountain across the valley from the back of Mont Fort; a staggering view most Verbier regulars will never see.</p> <p>Once the skins came off, we tore into the snow, finding jumps, drop-offs and sun-kissed ridges. As we put in steep turns down one virgin couloir, fresh snow waterfalls rolled over the rocks below. Pure exhilaration. The valley spat us out at Siviez where we joined the crowded afternoon lift queue of skiers who had absolutely no idea what they were missing.</p> <p>\u2022 Mountain Guide Travel (<a href=\"http://www.mountainguide.se\">mountainguide.se</a>) has a Best Skiing at the Moment package for \u20ac1,650pp, inc three-star B&amp;B, six days' guided off-piste skiing, lift passes, safety equipment and all transfers.

  "<p>Some of football's laws attract less controversy than others. Law Two, for example, declares that \"the ball shall be spherical\" and so far as is known nobody, not even John Terry or Gary Neville, has ever protested to the referee about its roundness.</p> <p>Similarly Law 10 would appear to leave little room for argument. This asserts that a goal is scored \"when the whole of the ball has passed over the goalline between the goalposts and under the crossbar\". No confusion there surely, Geoff Hurst and 1966 notwithstanding, and at Vicarage Road last Saturday a goal was given when the whole of the ball had indeed crossed the goalline. Trouble was it was not that part of the goalline which lies between the posts.</p> <p>Reading took the lead, much to their bewilderment and Watford's displeasure, when a linesman signalled a goal after the ball had gone out of play before Noel Hunt hooked it into the goalmouth. The referee consulted the assistant, who stuck to his conviction that the ball had entered the net rather than gone wide.</p> <p>The game was drawn 2-2 amid much speculation that it would have to be replayed. The Football League, however, decided that the result should stand and was right to do so in spite of a German precedent in 1994 when Bayern Munich were given a goal against Nuremberg for a shot which went wide and won 2-1. The Bundesliga ordered a replay, a decision which Franz Beckenbauer, then the Bayern coach, found \"incomprehensible\" although his team won the second match 5-0 anyway.</p> <p>Matches which have been completed should be replayed only as a remote last resort. In 1999 Arsenal beat Sheffield United 2-1 at Highbury in the fifth round of the FA Cup but their winner brought angry protests from the losers because it broke the modern convention that when play has been stopped to treat an injury the ball should be returned to the side that kicked it into touch so the victim could receive attention.</p> <p>Alan Kelly, the United goalkeeper, had kicked the ball out after a colleague went down but when play restarted Nwankwo Kanu received Ray Parlour's throw-in and naively set up an attack which led to Marc Overmars scoring. Within minutes of the final whistle the Arsenal manager, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, offered to replay the tie and the Football Association agreed \"in the interest of fair play\". Arsenal again won 2-1.</p> <p>The whole thing was a nonsense. The original result should have stood since Arsenal had scored a perfectly legitimate winner. There was a stronger case for replaying an FA Cup quarter-final between Newcastle United and Nottingham Forest in 1974 after a pitch invasion at St James' Park disrupted the original match when Forest had just scored with a penalty to lead 3-1. </p> <p>The teams were taken off for eight minutes and when play resumed Newcastle won 4-3. The FA ordered the tie to be played again at neutral Goodison Park, Newcastle eventually winning yet another replay after a 0-0 draw.</p> <p>It is easier to replay cup ties because the results have less effect on the standings of other teams. The Football League would have opened up a whole can of worms had Watford and Reading been told to meet again.</p> <p>Why stop there? Why not try again after a goal has been wrongly disallowed for offside, which was Liverpool's misfortune last weekend? Why not make West Ham replay every game in which Carlos Tevez scored?</p> <p>The business at Vicarage Road could have been sorted out had the Reading players explained to the officials what actually occurred. According to Stephen Hunt, however, this was not on. \"You can't say 'Hold on ref, don't give us a goal',\" he argued. But of course you can. It's called sportsmanship, a word apparently extinct in football's vocabulary.</p> <p>This was not always the case. Early in the 1971-72 season Crystal Palace were awarded a goal against Nottingham Forest after Steve Kember's shot had gone into the side netting but eventually Kember admitted that he had not in fact scored. </p> <p>A year earlier Alan Hudson's \"winner\" for Chelsea against Ipswich stood, although the ball had hit the stanchion outside the net. No Chelsea player was letting on, Hudson least of all.</p> <p>The Vicarage Road incident has revived the case for goalline technology, experiments with which have so far proved inconclusive. But what technology does anyone need to see whether or not a shot has gone wide? Referees require respect but officials unable to make the distinction should consider something less demanding of their eyesight. </p> <p>Like the local cribbage league.</p>",
  "<p>Born into a place of poverty and conflict, Zohair Abu Shaban, 24, has one clear ambition that would raise him above the hardship around him: he wants to be a professor of electrical engineering.</p> <p>For most young men born and raised in Gaza City, in the heart of the apparently intractable conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, this might seen an impossible dream. No university in Gaza offers any degree above undergraduate level and only the strip's top university, the Islamic University, runs an electrical engineering course.</p> <p>Abu Shaban, a well-mannered and diligent young man, took the course and graduated top in his year. He won awards for his work, which included a project to allow heart patients to be monitored at home through an internet link to their local hospital. </p> <p>He applied to continue his studies abroad and won a prestigious Fulbright scholarship to study for a masters at the University of Connecticut, in the United States. But to take up his place he had first to get out of Gaza, and that long and difficult challenge has all but undone his dream.</p> <p>Last year, Israel declared Gaza a \"hostile entity\" after Hamas, the Islamist movement that won Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006, seized full control of the strip. Israel closed the crossings out of Gaza and students such as Abu Shaban were unable to leave. In May, the US state department told the seven Fulbright scholars from Gaza that their scholarships had been cancelled, before an embarrassed Condoleezza Rice, the US secretary of state, intervened. </p> <p>In the end, three of the seven reached the US and began studying. A fourth had his US visa revoked on arrival in Washington, apparently because Israel had passed on unspecified security warnings, and two others, including Abu Shaban, remained in Gaza with their US visas cancelled, again for unspecified reasons. </p> <p>Abu Shaban has no political affiliations, no criminal record. Frustrated but not deterred, he won a place to begin a masters degree at Imperial College in London and has been told to arrive for his course by next Saturday. He won another full scholarship, this time from the Hani Qaddumi Foundation, a Palestinian group that supports bright young students, and he obtained a British visa.</p> <p>However, Israel still refuses to allow him to cross out of Gaza through Erez, the only crossing for people into Israel. Rafah, which is on the Egyptian border and is the only other non-commercial crossing out of Gaza, is closed.</p> <p>\"Students are the future of this country and if you don't give them the chance to learn, this country will have no future,\" he said. \"Peace only comes from education and if you steal education from the youth, I don't know what future there is.\"</p> <p>Rafah has been closed since June last year because of Egyptian concerns over Hamas and pressure from others, including both Israel and the Palestinian government in the West Bank, the rival to Hamas. Hamas has called for Rafah to be reopened and has said it will allow European border monitors to return, but insists Israel should not have a veto over the crossing's opening, as it did in the past under a US-negotiated agreement.</p> <p>Since last year, Rafah has opened only occasionally and briefly, because the Egyptians are anxious to avoid a repeat of scenes earlier this year when Hamas effectively brought down the border fence and tens of thousands of Gazans streamed across into northern Egypt.</p> <p>Last weekend, during one of those brief openings, Abu Shaban and many others like him rushed to the crossing. He spent 26 hours on a bus with other students before being turned away. \"My bag is still packed and I have hope it might open again,\" he said. There is no guarantee Rafah will open again, or that he and the other students will make it out if it does.</p> <p>He said his parents were \"heartbroken\" at what had happened and his younger brother, in his third year of a university civil engineering course in Gaza, had given up on his own ambitions to study abroad.</p> <p>After the Fulbright case in May, Israel allowed around 70 students to leave through Erez. Another 100 crossed out of Rafah in August, during one of its brief openings, and about 60 Gazans - students and their families - got out last weekend through Rafah.</p> <p>Yigal Palmor, an Israeli foreign ministry spokesman, said the restrictions on movement would remain as long as Gaza was ruled by Hamas. \"It is not really about the individual potential of each and every person, the question here is what do you do when there is a territorial entity ruled by a terrorist group that defies you violently by principle and refuses to maintain normal relations with you,\" he said.</p> <p>Some political analysts say that rather than weakening Hamas, Israel's restrictions have strengthened the group. Hamas has broadened its control over many areas of life in Gaza and its leaders are able to leave and re-enter through the Rafah crossing. They appear to obtain funding from abroad, including from Iran, with little difficulty. A ceasefire between Hamas and Israel that began in June this year has held, apart from occasional violations, but it has brought little respite to the tough economic blockade on Gaza.</p> <p>Hundreds more students remain stuck in Gaza, said Sari Bashi, the head of the Israeli rights group Gisha, which campaigns on behalf of the students. Each year, more than 1,000 Gazan students are enrolled in universities abroad and try to leave Gaza to study. </p> <p>\"By letting out a few people, Israel has been able to deflect attention from the hundreds of students and 1.5m people still trapped in Gaza,\" Bashi said. \"Punishing innocent civilians for the behaviour of militants or political leaders violates international prohibitions against collective punishment.\"</p>",
  "<p>A Spanish judge looking into the brutal repression of dictator General Francisco Franco's forces during the country's civil war has opened an investigation into the tens of thousands of victims of the so-called \"red terror\" unleashed by some of his leftwing opponents.</p> <p>Judge Baltasar Garz\u00f3n has asked authorities for a list of those killed on the orders of the tribunals set up by the leftwing Republican authorities in Madrid during the three-year civil war that ended in 1939.</p> <p>The judge provoked controversy last month when he asked government departments and the Roman Catholic church to help provide a list of names of those placed before firing squads by Franco's military tribunals or killed by rightwing death squads.</p> <p>That request followed a petition from campaigners who have been looking for and digging up the hundreds of mass graves containing the victims of Franco's forces and supporters. They delivered a list of more than 130,000 victims this week.</p> <p>Garz\u00f3n's initial investigation was criticised by rightwing politicians, who claimed he was stirring up old hatreds.</p> <p>Conservative commentators also condemned his latest request yesterday. \"It is a tactical move because there are doubts about whether the law permits Garz\u00f3n to do what he is trying to do,\" historian Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Marco told the rightwing radio station Cope.</p> <p>Campaigners said they saw no conflict. \"If we are going to be rigorous we have to say that this is the best thing he can do,\" said Rafael Gil, a spokesman in Granada for one of the many groups digging up graves.</p> <p>The names of those killed on the orders of Republican tribunals or by leftwing or anarchist death squads are readily available as they were gathered during Franco's 36-year dictatorship. Franco's courts dealt with many of the perpetrators of those atrocities - often by sending them to the firing squad.</p> <p>A large white cross on a hill beside Madrid's Barajas airport marks the spot, at Paracuellos de Jarama, where several thousand victims of leftwing firing squads are buried.</p> <p>Many campaigners say it is too late for the perpetrators of the repression carried out by Franco's side to be put on trial as the people involved are mostly dead and the crimes are covered by a 1977 amnesty law.</p>",
  "<p>Somali pirates have captured a Ukrainian cargo ship carrying military hardware, including grenade launchers and 33 Russian-made tanks, in the latest brazen attack in the most dangerous waters in the world.</p> <p>The MV Faina was hijacked on Thursday off the coast of Somalia, where Islamist insurgents are battling government and Ethiopian troops in some of the heaviest fighting in years. </p> <p>The Ukrainian defence minister, Yury Yekhanurov, said the cargo also included \"a substantial quantity of ammunition and spare parts\".</p> <p>Russia, which has three citizens among the 21 crew members, responded to the news yesterday by sending a warship to Somalia to address \"the rise in pirate attacks, especially against Russian citizens\".</p> <p>It is not yet known where the freighter, which flies under a Belize flag but is managed by the Ukrainian company Tomax Team Inc, is being held. </p> <p>The heavily armed Somali pirate gangs, who have captured at least 30 ships this year, are rarely interested in a ship's cargo, preferring to extract a ransom for the vessel and its crew that frequently amounts to millions of pounds.</p> <p>But the presence of arms and ammunition on board the Faina make it an especially dangerous seizure in a country ruled only by the gun for 17 years.</p> <p>The destination of the tanks also raised serious questions, especially given the current instability across the Horn of Africa. </p> <p>Ukraine insisted the deal was \"in accordance with international law\", and said that the weapons had been sold to Kenya, which it said had already received 77 T-72 tanks from Ukraine in 2007. The Kenyan government later issued a statement confirming that it had purchased the cargo aboard the MV Faina for its military forces.</p> <p>Andrew Mwangura, head of East African Seafarers' Assistance Programme in Mombasa, which closely monitors piracy in the region, said that the Faina's manifest showed merely that she was carrying cargo weighing 2,320 tonnes.</p> <p>He said that Ukrainian ships had twice offloaded heavy weaponry, including tanks, at Mombasa port in recent times, but that the hardware had been transferred to south Sudan, which is holding on to a fragile peace after ending a 20-year civil war with the Khartoum government in 2005. The claim could not be independently verified.</p> <p>Mwangura said that there had been no demands as yet from the pirates holding the Faina, but that he expected the tanks would be used as a \"bargaining chip\" to extract a large ransom. </p> <p>Typically, the pirates send a list of the crew's nationalities and cargo to intermediaries abroad, who decide on the size of the ransom and facilitate payments from shipping companies or governments.</p> <p>Somalia's weak government, which has no coastguard, says it is powerless to stop the pirates who stalk the busy shipping lanes along the country's 2,300-mile coastline. Launching high-powered speedboats from captured \"mother ships\", the gangs can strike more than 200 nautical miles from shore in the Gulf of Aden, the main sea link between Europe and Asia, as well as along Somalia's east coast.</p> <p>Patrols by the multinational taskforce in Djibouti in recent years have failed to act as a deterrent. </p> <p>Alarmed by the surge in attacks, the security council in June authorised countries to send warships into Somali waters, with the government's consent, to combat piracy. </p> <p>Since then, France has twice sent commandos to rescue French citizens aboard captured yachts held on the Somali coast, and last week it drafted a resolution urging states to deploy naval vessels and military aircraft to take on the pirates.</p> <p>But the chaotic and desperate situation on land in Somalia means that there is no shortage of young gunmen eager to join in the lucrative plunder at sea, regardless of the risk.</p> <p>The Islamist-led insurgency targeting government troops, African Union peacekeepers and Ethiopian forces who swept into Somalia to oust an Islamist regime in December 2006 is now stronger than ever. </p> <p>Over the past five days battles in Mogadishu have claimed at least 80 lives, with 15,000 people fleeing the city. Since January 160,000 people have been displaced from the capital, adding to the 700,000 people who left Mogadishu due to the conflict in 2007.</p> <p>With drought also affecting large parts of the country, Somalia is facing a humanitarian crisis that may be the worst in Africa. </p> <p>At least 3.2 million people need urgent food aid, but the rampant insecurity and deliberate targeting of all foreigners means delivering relief is extremely difficult and dangerous.</p> <p>The pirates, who are not directly linked to the insurgency, have previously contributed to the crisis by hijacking ships chartered by the World Food Programme, making deliveries by sea - the easiest and cheapest method - impossible without escorts from international warships.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>Indonesia has long held the dubious record as the <strong>piracy capital</strong> of the world. But in 2008 Somali pirates surged to the top of the table both in their frequency of attacks and the money made. </p> <p>During the first six months of the year there were 24 reported attempts to hijack ships in Somali waters. Since then the heavily armed gangs have been working overtime, seizing <strong>four ships in 48 hours</strong> in August - a record for modern-day pirates. At least a dozen ships and 200 international crew members are being held near the village of Eyl, on Somalia's eastern coastline. </p> <p>The East African Seafarers' Assistance Programme estimates that there are now more than 1,000 gunmen working for the five main pirate groups in Somalia, which have about <strong>50 high-powered speedboats</strong> at their disposal. The gunmen can earn thousands of dollars in just a few months - a fortune in a war-ravaged country. </p> <p>But it is the Somali financiers, usually sitting in Kenya, Dubai, Canada and the UK, that are making the <strong>big money</strong>. They keep the bulk of the ransom, which for a European or Japanese-owned ship, or one with westerners on board, can run into millions of pounds.</p>",
  "<p>We have always wanted to grow our own vegetables and now that we have a largish garden and have two growing children, it's become something of an imperative. But here is the problem: I don't know where to start. I nag my husband every weekend to do something about it but he doesn't, as he says there's nothing to be done at this time of year. So I have decided to have a go myself. But I am really stumped. Raised vegetable beds or just in the ground? Everything I read confuses me further.<br><strong>Carly Vellan</strong>, Birmingham</p> <p>Your husband is not entirely wrong. You can have a go at planting something at this time of year, but there's little sowing to be done really. But there's also no reason you can't crack on and prepare things, not least because the sense of satisfaction - and empowerment - you will get will be enormous. You can read too much and get yourself so confused you do nothing - remember that it's gardening, not surgery. If you get it wrong, no one is going to die, just maybe some plants. </p> <p>Raised beds have lots of advantages: you can control the content of the soil and suit it to what you're growing; it heats up faster (ergo you can plant earlier); you don't need to bend down as much to work on it; and if you have rabbits it can help keep them off young plants. But slugs and snails do love to hide in the corners and along the sides. You can plant straight into an existing bed if you like, but personally I would do raised beds. Jane Perrone, the gardening editor of Guardian Weekend magazine and author of The Allotment Keeper's Handbook: A Down-to-Earth Guide to Growing Your Own Food (\u00a314.99, Atlantic) also advocates raised beds and advises that, if you're keen to do something now, you could certainly prepare the beds. </p> <p>You can have them any height you want, from a few inches to waist-height. Bear in mind if you have children that it's a nice idea to have them at a height they can help at - and see things - too. If you don't like bending over too much, higher is better, and don't make them so wide you can't work comfortably from either side. What you make them out of is a question of personal choice. Wood looks nicest but requires a teeny bit of skill and confidence with a hammer and nails. There's a lovely book - my top tip for you - called Grow Your Own Veg by Carol Klein (\u00a316.99) that covers how to make raised beds, as well as a complete step-by-step guide to each vegetable and what sort of soil it needs, when to plant it etc. </p> <p>Perrone recommends, for ease and speed, Link-a-Bord (<a href=\"http://linkabord.co.uk\">linkabord.co.uk</a>, 01773 590566). These are made from 98% recycled plastic and start at \u00a311 for a 0.5 sq metre kit. It's also possible to stack them with a stretcher kit. You could get these up and running in a matter of half an hour or so. You then fill your bed with earth from your garden and mix in some peat-free compost from a garden centre (obviously, the deeper the bed the more soil you'll need) and some compost if you have any from your own heap. Add some seaweed granules (from \u00a37.15 for a 2.5kg bag, <a href=\"http://www.organiccatalog.com\">organiccatalog.com</a>, 0845 130 1304), either mixed in or as a mulch, and these will seep into the soil to add nutrients. Then cover with newspaper and plastic sheeting (weighed down with bricks), which will warm up the soil and suppress weeds. Then you can either sit back and wait until March when you can start planting, or start growing some cut-and-come-again salads in tubs now (cover with plastic sheeting or old water bottles if not sheltered). Perrone recommends some Oriental greens and salads, 99p for a packet of seeds, from Tamar Organics (<a href=\"http://tamarorganics.co.uk\">tamarorganics.co.uk</a>, 01579 371087). Or for a more traditional mix try the baby leaf salad mix seeds, from \u00a31.99. This is also a nice way to get into growing your own because salads are expensive in the shops and, as everyone I've spoken to about this advises, \"Grow what you like to eat!\" - presuming you and your family like salad. (A note here: some gardeners will say you can sow things now but the experts I've spoken to say you've less chance of failure if you wait until the earth starts to warm up in about March.)</p> <p>As to what to do after this, I think your best bet here is to look at a vegetable calendar. Different seeds need different temperatures of soil to germinate - this is why you can't just plant anything willy-nilly now as we go into winter. So, think of what you would like to eat, look up when it needs to be planted and when it will be ready to harvest and go from there. The Royal Horticultural Society (<a href=\"http://rhs.org.uk\">rhs.org.uk</a>) has a whole Grow Your Own Veg section, which is free for anyone to access. This is packed with information on what to grow, when to sow and how to grow it, and has a really useful veg calendar that tells you month by month what to do. I'd seriously consider sitting down with a nice cup of tea and reading through it all. Good luck!</p>",
  "<p>The Heart of Midlothian players and staff were yesterday paid their overdue salaries, with the team manager Csaba Laszlo adamant that the players' focus has not been diverted from on-field matters despite another traumatic few days at the club.</p> <p>The majority of the Hearts squad are paid weekly but those monies were not deposited into their accounts, as expected, last Friday. Office and support staff, meanwhile, did not receive their regular monthly salaries on Wednesday. The club blamed a technical glitch for the embarrassing episode and payments were made yesterday. However, the vexed issue of Vladimir Romanov's stewardship of the Edinburgh club has once again been raised.</p> <p>Yet Laszlo, who takes his team to Dundee United this afternoon, seemed unperturbed by the fiasco. \"It was not a big problem,\" he said. \"I and a few of the players have looked at our bank accounts this morning and we can now concentrate on football. I have no influence on this. My job is to bring results, not to worry about things like this.\"</p> <p>As if to emphasise his relaxed attitude about the delays, Laszlo added that he waited three years for backdated pay from one of his former clubs, Ferencvaros, after the Hungarian club suffered financial difficulties.</p> <p>Such delays are apparently more common than some would imagine. Mike Tullberg, the Danish striker on loan at Tynecastle from Reggina, claimed that he was due four months of backdated wages at one stage when playing in Italy. \"As players, you concentrate on things you can do something about,\" he said. \"This is not an issue for me. In Italy such things are normal because they have a different culture from Scotland. Honestly, I haven't thought about it and it hasn't been a problem for the players.\"</p> <p>Despite the bullish talk, however, Hearts have so far been unable to offer a categorical assurance that there will be no similar problem in the future. Amid such uncertainty, Romanov's business background will be studied even more closely than usual in the coming weeks. The Lithuanian's business, the Ukio Bankas Investment Group, reported a profit of \u00a35.7m for the six months to June of this year.</p> <p>Celtic have completed the signing of the 22-year-old American goalkeeper Dominic Cervi. The former Chicago Fire player has agreed a two-year deal at Parkhead, having earlier undergone a trial period at Portsmouth. Because he is of Italian parentage, Cervi does not need a work permit. \"We see him as a two-year project,\" said the Celtic manager, Gordon Strachan. </p> <p>The club's first-choice goalkeeper, Artur Boruc, has regularly been linked with moves to England while the Pole's understudy, Mark Brown, is likely to seek a new club to secure first-team football.</p>",

Born and bred in New York, she was in her early 20s, on holiday in London with her parents, when a waiter at the Connaught started fussing around them murmuring, \"Sir Alistair and Lady Cooke.\" Neither parent seemed fazed. Kittredge, on the other hand, made a dash for the ladies, where she sat in a cubicle and thought, \"What the heck?\" </p> <p>This was the early 70s and Cooke, freshly knighted, hadn't lived in Britain since 1936. For more than 30 years, however, his disembodied fame had grown steadily from his dispatches in the Guardian and weekly Letter From America on BBC Radio. He would eventually become famous in his adopted home, too, from appearances on TV that his daughter says \"were like a balm. People said, 'Phew, there is still an anchor someplace.'\" But that was nothing compared with his status at home, where he became part of the country's rhythm, as reliable as the Shipping Forecast. And if in later years he seemed anachronistic, it was in the best sense of a continuity, an ability to contextualise from memory any world event, so that on September 11 2001 he recalled having lived through the same date in 1914, when the first battle of the first world war took place and 250,000 British soldiers were killed. Cooke would have turned 100 in November, and the response from the old country has, says Kittredge, been \"very heartwarming\". And although she is a mother of five, she retains that air of surprise when considering that her parents had a life before she was born.</p> <p>Kittredge lives in a beautiful house on a lake in Vermont, a place Cooke disliked. Flying, knives, lateness, illness, imagined illness and the countryside all brought out bad temper in him. He was a hypochondriac and prepared for the worst. \"Daddy had a tendency to be scared,\" his daughter says.</p> <p>He would, then, have been horrified by the scandal following his death in 2004, when the New York funeral home the family used was found to be faking permission from relatives and selling body parts, Cooke's among them, to biotech firms. In June this year, the head of the harvesting operation, Michael Mastromarino, was sentenced to 18-54 years. \"But he'll be eligible for parole.\" There is a group action under way from some of the other families, seeking damages, but, says Kittredge, \"We said we're not having anything to do with that. I wanted to be able to speak out about it and never be accused of potentially wreaking some financial benefit.\"</p> <p>Did Mastromarino apologise? \"Yeah.\" She shrugs. The fact that he got away with it for so long is a consequence, she says, of a squeamishness about death, which hands over extraordinary power to funeral directors. \"We are really happy that they come and take [the problem] away.\" There would have to be a \"big cultural shift\" for that to change, but for now she is tired of the subject. For the centenary celebration she wants to talk about her father's life, \"when we have for two years been so focused on his death\".</p> <p>How would Cooke himself have written about it? He was suspicious of tradition for the sake of it. After Jack Kennedy's funeral, he admitted in a BBC broadcast, \"I am not, myself, much disposed to lingering over these mournful rituals.\" He was also resistant to mass outpourings of sentiment. The week of the assassination, while everyone else collapsed in tearful tribute, Cooke gently reminded his audience that, despite the great ideals of the late president, it was useful to recognise \"the very slow translation of these ideals into law... We have to admit that the clear trumpet sound of the Kennedy inaugural has been sadly soured down three short years.\"</p> <p>The irony is that, by emigrating to America, Cooke became a more conventional Englishman than he could ever have been at home. Growing up in Salford and later as a student at Cambridge, he was viewed as flighty and above himself. His father was an iron fitter and a fire and brimstone Methodist lay preacher, from whence came Cooke's lifelong scepticism about religion. His mother ran a boarding house. \"Expectations were not high,\" Kittredge says. \"Somehow he got this injection of energy, curiosity and enthusiasm, and it wasn't going to do well there.\" At university he founded the first society for women actors, as well as involving himself in journalism and creative writing. \"He'd have comments from his professors saying, 'He's not quite focused.'\" </p> <p>Being not quite focused is a basic requirement of journalism, of course, and after going to graduate school at Yale, Cooke became a film critic for the BBC and got a job with NBC news in London, broadcasting a \"London Letter\": a 15-minute talk on British life for American listeners. In 1946 he left permanently for the US where he became the Manchester Guardian's chief US correspondent. His first Letter for the BBC was broadcast in March that year, and continued weekly for 58 years until a month before his death. \"There was space for him here, where perhaps in England some of his exuberant forays were not greeted with enthusiasm. In America, he was not the cowboy; America saw him as what he had not been able quite to be in England.\"</p> <p>In profile, Kittredge looks very like her father, the long, Roman nose and strong chin. Her porch overlooks fields running down to the lake and she says she was as much born in the wrong place as her father was - \"The way transsexuals say they were born in the wrong body.\" She hated Manhattan as a child and longed for the countryside. \"We lived near Central Park and I would bring back all these stray dogs and say, 'Can I keep this?' And he would say, 'Good God, no, get rid of it.' By the time I was seven, I was going to camp in New England for a month, at eight for two months, and then I went to boarding school in Vermont. I'm happier in the woods.\"</p> <p>Cooke was bemused by his daughter. Her mother, Jane, an artist, was Cooke's second wife and is now 95 (\"I warn my children I may be around for some time,\" Kittredge says dryly). After her husband's death, she moved to a retirement community in Vermont where she has circumvented the home's no-smoking rules - you are not allowed to smoke even in the grounds - by abandoning her car in the car park and going out there every day for a crafty fag. The life her parents led in Manhattan for their 60-year marriage was, says Kittredge, full of parties and celebrities, and the energy of a man who never liked to go to bed early. \"The thing people don't know about Daddy is that he loved to laugh. He loved a good joke. The intensity he gave to his work, he gave to play and fun as well. And my mother was always keen. She'd be working all day and get dinner for the kids and be exhausted and at 10.30pm he'd say, 'Shall we go to a jazz club?' She just wanted to go to bed, but she never said no.\" </p> <p>Jazz was one of Cooke's great loves. He discovered it at Cambridge and it was his soundtrack to America: \"This music that dealt with the Depression and gave some sense of hope and joy and melancholy, and it was all wrapped in the geography of this place.\" The morning after one of her parents' parties, Kittredge would creep into the kitchen in their Upper East Side apartment and - \"Oh my goodness, the blue smoke, wading through it to find the cereal box. They were very gay - I miss the word gay in that respect. They were in Manhattan when it was at its height, and he crossed over between serious reporters and the theatrical world, and that made for quite a social life.\"</p> <p>The only famous guest to have impressed Kittredge was James Thurber, because his blindness fascinated the little girl. Were Cooke's standards hard to live up to? She smiles. \"Only if you talked. Only if you opened your mouth. 'Um' would get you your tongue cut out. And my sister always says, 'You know' and it drove him crazy. He would yell, 'I don't know, I don't know! That's why you're talking and I'm not, because you're going to tell me something I don't know!'\" </p> <p>Even to friends, Cooke was known as The Corrector, a name invented by New Yorker theatre critic Brendan Gill. \"He was a real stickler for language and speech, and not much else. Not much else bothered him.\"</p> <p>Not even his daughter's choice of career - she is an ordained minister in a community church with denominational ties to the United Church of Christ. Cooke didn't see that coming; he brought up his children to be as secular as he could manage. \"Both my mother and father were raised in very strict religious households with a view of God as a harsh judgmental deity, and rejected the idea that they would ever do this to their children. That was one of their great bonds. And I don't know if it's the forbidden fruit, but it became this secret thing for me. And because I went to liberal schools in New York, my introduction to religion was through the back door, through art, iconography and literature. And I started going to church when I came to Vermont.\"</p> <p>After the shock subsided, Cooke took it in his stride and even saw that their two jobs had things in common. \"Daddy and I would joke that he would do his sermon every week and I would do mine.\"</p> <p>Looking back, the most striking thing about the Letter is how resistant Cooke was to the sway of popular opinion. His early dispatches focused on the under-reported scandal of the soldiers returning from the second world war, to poor housing and scant provision from the government. During the cold war, he wrote honestly and emotionally of his fears; his tone was always personal, particularly after he went through a period of intense Freudian analysis. During the Watts riots in the 60s, he looked at how the American dream had become not a spiritual state but a function of consumerism. \"We are victims of our own advertising,\" he wrote. </p> <p>Occasionally he overreacted. Cooke disliked bad manners and the hippy movement dismayed him. In one Letter, in answer to the question, \"Who are the hippies?\" he shared findings from \"a limited New York psychiatric study [that] asserts that as many as 60% are seriously sick, mostly with schizophrenia\".</p> <p>He was in the room in 1968 when Robert Kennedy was shot and, although in deep shock, started making notes immediately on a scrap of paper. Ethel Kennedy's eyes, he wrote, \"had turned into cinders\", and \"down on the greasy floor was a huddle of clothes and staring out of it the face of Bobby Kennedy\". </p> <p>The way he wrote the Letter changed over the years; in his youth, when he was still writing daily for the Guardian, he used to leave it to the last minute and \"let the subconscious take over\", Kittredge says. \"But then, as he got older and wasn't doing the Guardian or Masterpiece Theatre [he hosted PBS' showcase of British television for more than 20 years], the Letter took over. It was the week's focus in the later years. Start on Monday, sit down, watch the news, read the paper, and it took all week.\"</p> <p>When people stopped him in the street to say, \"Aren't you...?\" he would parry, \"That's right, I'm Bob Hope\" until the day when a woman replied, \"Isn't that interesting - I'm Mrs Bob Hope.\" (And she was. They both collapsed with laughter. It was Cooke's favourite story.) </p> <p>It was with some relief that, at 95, he finally stopped broadcasting. He had been diagnosed with cancer and given between three and six months to live. The fact, as his wife said, that he \"only used one\" was in keeping with his nature - brisk and to the point. </p> <p>Kittredge will come to Britain at the centenary of his birth for a reception at the American embassy and readings from her father's work at various literary festivals. Her daughter, Eliza, has just graduated from Columbia Journalism School and is working for ABC news in London. Kittredge says her father would have loved this election, and approved of and been fascinated by Obama. In response to a question to which she doesn't know the answer, she still finds herself thinking, \"I'll just call Daddy.\" But then, \"It's wonderful to be able to hear his voice so much. Most people just have a message on an answering machine.\" </p> <p>When it was time to leave the New York apartment in which the family had lived for half a century, Kittredge was crying, but her mother, a woman after her husband's heart, refused to give in to regret. \"It was obviously the end of an era and we were just weeping and Mother, on her cane, was walking out the door and she turned around and said quietly, 'All things come to an end.' \" </p> <p>\u2022 Free with the Guardian next Saturday, October 4: a 36-page collection of Alistair Cooke's classic essays.</p>",
  "<p>007 was something of a label queen with his accessories: Ronson lighter, triple-banded Morland cigarettes, Pinaud Elixir shampoo - aka \"that prince among shampoos\" - soap by Floris, Rolex watch ... </p> <p>It could be argued that, with all these references, Fleming singlehandedly invented male style journalism. Yet Bond's clothes were remarkable for their taut, under-designed discretion. 007 was always required to wear a kind of well-tailored but unobtrusive glamourflage; kit that could parlay him to a ritzy Monte Carlo casino or an edgy Harlem jazz club. Fleming's Bond never admits to a preference for Savile Row tailoring - in fact, Fleming never mentions any of Bond's clothing by label, preferring to describe, simply, \"a dark blue suit\" or \"a thin black knitted silk tie\".</p> <p>But when outlining the clothes of Bond's various barmy adversaries, Fleming turns into the forensic fashion scribe, outlining each item in detail, name-dropping labels all over the shop. In Thunderball, say, Count Lippe wore Charvet shirts, ties from Dior and Hardy Amies, shoes from N Peal, etc, as if to suggest that such a meticulous attention to one's wardrobe was somehow gauche, nouveau and dangerously narcissistic - a penchant for flash clobber going hand in hand with a psychotic desire to achieve world domination. That said, times are changing in the global megalomania arena: after Casino Royale, Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen, who played Le Chiffre, became the pan-global face of, not Smersh or Stromberg, but high-street outfitters H&amp;M. Watch out, Bond, he'll set his store detectives on to you ...</p> <h2>The best- (and worst-) dressed Bond baddies</h2> <p><strong>1: Auric Goldfinger, Goldfinger, 1964</strong></p> <p>Fleming is particularly unkind when styling Goldfinger's golfing wardrobe, describing him, archly, as a graceless arriviste who has gone to an outfitter's and said, \"Dress me for golf - you know, like they wear in Scotland.\" Togged up in thick socks, brogues, tweed plus fours and a cardie, in various tones of rust and mustard to acknowledge his obsession with hi-worth metallurgy (even his first name, Auric, means \"golden\"), Goldfinger comes off not as menacing but as cuddly, clumsy, comedic - Wodehousian, even - while slender, urbane Bond, in black sports casuals and a Doherty-esque trilby, looks much more the Gary Player-ish, 19th hole barfly. Later, while guiding a laser between Bond's legs (and issuing the memorable line, \"No, Mr Bond, I expect you to die!\"), Goldfinger wears a rather splendid Lurex tuxedo with a gold shawl collar that appears to have been designed by Hedi Slimane during his apprenticeship at High And Mighty.</p> <p><strong>2: Ernst Stavro Blofeld, You Only Live Twice, 1967</strong></p> <p>Back in the 60s, the default setting kit for a delusional, megalomaniacal nutcase, hellbent on world domination, was a vaguely Chinese tunic with buttons fastened all the way to the top. Accessorise with a vicious scar, a fluffy white cat and a big chair nicked from the Big Brother Diary Room, and before you can say, \"Ah, Mr Bond, I've been expecting you\", you have the archetypal Fleming bad boy. The initially scary Blofeld appeared in seven Bond films, played variously by six different actors (including Telly Savalas), but his Maoist suits remained a constant. </p> <p>That said, there's something distinctly Yohji-ish about Donald Pleasence's Blofeld wardrobe. It is clean, asexual, a bit arty and singular but also minimal and nicely finished. Other Blofelds added jetted pockets and military patch pockets, but Pleasence's monkishly unadorned cut is the most unsettling. The pinky ring - a big, ostentatious gold job fashioned in the shape of an Octopus (the Smersh logo) - is his only flirtation with blinging flamboyance. (Although, since Mike Myers' Bond baddie parody Dr Evil, it's impossible to look at Blofeld without one's little finger reaching for the corner of the mouth and the words \"one million dollars!\" spewing forth.)</p> <p><strong>3: Max Zorin, A View To A Kill, 1985 </strong></p> <p>The immaculately cold, deliciously arrogant Christopher Walken stepped in to play Zorin when David Bowie turned down the role, and you can see the Thin White Duke's influence in Bond's archenemy's steely Euro style. For much of the film, Zorin rocks the same oddly disturbing, formal-bland duds favoured by Bowie's businessman alien in The Man Who Fell To Earth. As one would expect from the product of a botched Nazi experiment, computer-chip mogul now resident in France, Zorin was coolly particular, hygienic and stylistically aloof rather than overtly fashionable, but in the odd scene his choice of closely tailored, three-buttoned suits predated similar ensembles by Prada by several years. And Walken's blond, bouffanted hair - only an inch or two off a Winehousesque beehive, in some scenes - is magnificent. </p> <p><strong>4: Jaws, The Spy Who Loved Me, 1977 </strong></p> <p>It's a good job this guy had some elaborately menacing dentistry to fall back on because, from the neck down, Jaws' very horrible chocolate-on-biscuit-beige outfit shows the distinct influence of nothing more intimidating than a crooning Terry Venables, or the kind of get-up that Bruce Forsyth would have worn to present the Generation Game. Actually, strike that; take off the head and you have a smart-casual, Tarby-at-Wentworth style that bears more than a passing resemblance to the outfit Gordon Brown wore on his recent holiday to Suffolk. His excuse? Because of his teeth, 7ft 2in Jaws was a metal-mouthed mute. This made the ordering of bespoke clothing something of a problem. </p> <p><strong>5: Dr Julius No, Dr No, 1962</strong></p> <p>The celluloid rendition of Dr Julius has a whiff of the Daft Punks about him. His crude, snub-ended bionic hands are pervy but fashionably sci-fi recherch\u00e9, and provide a shiny black accent to his off-white, fly-fronted, high-collared, Prussian-influenced tunic. Scary 46 years ago, yes, but nowadays you can get more stylish prosthetics on the NHS and Nehru-collared jackets are worn only by clueless Sloanes at charity balls.</p> <p><strong>6: Largo, Thunderball, 1965</strong></p> <p>There's a great bit in Thunderball where Italian extortion expert Emilio Largo walks in to a slickly appointed Paris boardroom. Two rows of nervous employees sit on wing-backed chairs, notebooks on laps, as their devastating boss saunters between them looking splendid in a dark, single-breasted suit, cut in the Milanese \"bum freezer\" style. This is the only time that one of 007's enemies got to do a catwalk show - fitting, really, because Largo remains the best-dressed Bond baddie of all time. Roman and animalistic, he accessorised with a piratical eye patch, a long stick thing (for pointing at big maps) and smouldering ciggie in a slightly camp holder permanently clamped in his mouth. When the action moves to the Bahamas, he looks marvellously insane in a white sharkskin dinner jacket (Fleming's Bond would only ever wear such a gauche item at sea). And what's not to love about a man who names his yacht Disco Volante?</p> <p><strong>7: Francisco Scaramanga, The Man With The Golden Gun, 1974</strong></p> <p>Played by Christopher Lee, Scaramanga's easy Catalan style paid unfortunate tribute to the US leisurewear craze of the 70s; so the shirt-cut white suit has a ghillie collar and feminine buttons, making our baddie look more benign Austrian pharmacist than ruthless assassin. The outfit is saved from terminal naffness by some choice accessories: nice cufflinks and a gold cigarette lighter that turns into a hand gun. </p> <p><strong>8: Mr Big/Dr Kananga, Live And Let Die, 1973</strong></p> <p>Were they to remake Live And Let Die today, Mr Big would probably be played by Snoop, Mos Def or The Game, and would be all gussied up like an MTV video pimp. Back then, a white blazer, a red shirt, a Chris Eubank haircut and some snooker ref's gloves were apparently enough to get Roger Moore's eyebrows twitching like a pair of fornicating caterpillars. Even less scary was Kananga's sidekick, a chap called Tee Hee, who had a metal clamp where his right hand should have been. He wore a scarlet jacket as a nod to his lust for bloody voodoo rituals, but actually looked like a jovial redcoat from Butlins.</p>",
  "<p>Michele, which is not her real name, is a small, watchful teenager from south London. She used to have a rottweiler. \"Kids would offer us \u00a3300 for it because it was so aggressive,\" she says. One day she finally agreed to sell the dog to some teenage boys. They suggested meeting at a railway station near her flat to conclude the deal. But when she approached the boys on one of the platforms, just as a train was pulling in, they tried to grab her rottweiler by the lead without handing over the money. She refused to let go of the dog. The boys pulled. The train carriage doors gaped open behind them. In the end, the lead snapped. The boys jumped on the train without the dog and disappeared into the city.</p> <p>Michele tells this story without drama. She has a different dog now, \"an English staff\", she says, brown and white and strong in the shoulders. As we talk, he strains on his lead, skitters from side to side on the pavement, jumps up. \"Staffs can be rough, vicious,\" she continues. \"When I got him, he'd been passed around loads of owners. You could say a word and he would just go for it.\" A pause. \"He's not like that any more.\"</p> <p>What's the point, then, of always having such scary dogs? Michele shrugs. \"It's a south London thing. The rougher your dog is, the better you are.\" </p> <p>In fact, it's much more than a south London thing. In recent years, rough, or rough-looking, dogs have become a dramatically more visible part of the British urban landscape. \"There are tens of thousands of pit bull-type dogs out there,\" says Holly Lee of the canine welfare and lobby group the Kennel Club. James Beaufoy, secretary of the Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club, estimates that there are \"between 300,000 and 400,000\" of the breed in Britain, and \"as many again staffordshire crosses\". Last year, only labradors and spaniels outnumbered staffs in the breed totals registered by the Kennel Club - and registering with the Kennel Club may not be a priority for teenage staff owners from south London.</p> <p>Other breeds with bodybuilders' necks and jaws like wheel clamps - French mastiffs, Japanese fighting dogs, South American hunting dogs - are well on the way to becoming urban cults, too. On hip-hop and dubstep videos, on YouTube, on specialist canine websites, rough dogs strut, lunge, fight and hang from tree branches by their teeth, snorting and wheezing, their proud owners grinning beside them. \"People look at the internet to learn about breeds, get ideas,\" says Ali Taylor, head of animal welfare at Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home. \"The trend is for bigger, more muscly dogs.\"</p> <p>But it is not just the dogs that have changed. It's the owners. \"We're seeing a new group,\" says Nigel Griffiths, a veterinary surgeon at the Blue Cross animal hospitals in London. \"They're in their teens and early 20s. It's become a trendy thing to have a dog on a lead if you're a youth with a hood.\" </p> <p>Alex Neil, an SNP member of the Scottish Parliament who is seeking to extend the legislation covering dangerous dogs, is more specific still: \"The typical profile of the owner of a dangerous dog is male, big build, with a tattoo, living in a housing scheme, wanting to show himself off.\" </p> <p>As this subculture has grown, so have some of the more alarming indicators of canine behaviour. In England, the number of people admitted for emergency hospital treatment after dog attacks has risen by approaching half in the past four years, to 3,787 in 2006-2007; in London, the number of these victims under the age of 18 has increased by 119%. Convictions of dog owners in England and Wales for having a dangerously out of control dog, or allowing that dog to injure or seriously intimidate someone, have trebled since 1997. Last year, a report by Southwark council in London, Public Space &amp; Nuisance Dogs, found \"dogs have become the 'weapon of choice'... for a rising number of thugs\". Taylor explains: \"A dog is a better weapon than a bullet or a knife, because it can go round a corner after someone.\"</p> <p>Mark Callis, head of the dog control unit at Wandsworth council in London, describes two other increasingly common scenarios: \"A couple of youths come up to you and say, 'Give us your phone or we'll set the dog on you.' And dogs accompany people carrying drugs. Drug runners know many police officers are scared of dogs and will call for a dog unit, which gives the drug runners time to get away.\"</p> <p>When it comes to rough dogs, the newspaper headlines virtually write themselves. Yet all dogs will always alarm some people, reasonably or not. And the current anxiety about rough dogs may dovetail a little too neatly with other modern British fears - sometimes media-stoked and questionable themselves - about teenagers and gangs and bad estates and public menace and disorder. \"One of the things you get at residents' meetings,\" Callis says, \"is they want something done about the youths with the dogs. But Mrs Miggins upstairs with a labrador, they say she's OK.\" </p> <p>There are an estimated 7.3 million dogs in Britain, almost half as many again as 40 years ago; the amount of violence and lawbreaking in which they are involved, while it is increasing sharply, is proportionately very small. The craze for staffordshire bull terriers and similar breeds cannot be put down purely to a surge in urban aggression and criminality. What, then, is really going on? </p> <p>The Doddington estate in Battersea in south London is a dense, slightly forbidding forest of council blocks squeezed between railway tracks and main roads. It used to be known locally for shoplifting and occasional murders. Now it is known for its rough dogs. \"The Doddington is probably our most troubled estate for dog issues,\" Callis says. </p> <p>On a sunny late summer morning, the chain of well-kept play areas under the trees along the estate's southern edge is empty of children. Instead, it is full of warning notices: \"No Dogs Allowed\", \"No Dogs On Amenity Greens Playgrounds Gardens And Drying Areas\", \"Maximum Penalty \u00a3500\". Some of the signs are old and faded, some newer and harder to miss. Both kinds, unlike the estate in general, have been heavily vandalised. A single small sign has been bent, slashed across with graffiti, scratched with a coin and pitted with what look like air gun pellets. </p> <p>The playgrounds are also full of dogs. In one a woman in her 30s talks on her mobile phone while her lean mastiff cross, off the lead, gallops back and forth. In another play area, another youngish woman stands smoking, a heavy black staffordshire beside her, also off the lead. As I walk past, the dog, without barking, notices me and charges. Its owner does not move or speak. Only the playground fence makes the dog stop. It stares from behind the bars, legs rigid, not backing off. Its owner stays where she is, silently finishing her cigarette, unconcerned. </p> <p>In nearby Battersea Park, a favourite with local dog-walkers, another short-haired, muscular dog is snoozing under a tree. Its owner, Pete, a big man with gold teeth and a tracksuit, is fishing in the lake. He lives on the Doddington and is unemployed. What breed is his dog? Pete smiles. \"Mixed. Staffs, pit bull and labrador. That's a fighting dog. But she doesn't fight because she's mine.\" He laughs. \"I do the fighting.\"</p> <p>Pete has another dog I don't meet until later: a Japanese akita, thick-coated and burly like a husky on steroids. According to the website dogbreedinfo.com, akitas are \"intelligent\" and \"very affectionate\", but \"capable of ferocity\" and \"very aggressive to other dogs\". Pete's akita is wearing a studded leather chest harness like a medieval breastplate and cost him \u00a31,800. How did he buy it? \"From a pub. I looked on the internet. You can get a shit staff for under \u00a3100.\"</p> <p>His dogs are called Amber and Marbles. Their coats look immaculate. He has a lead neatly coiled in his tracksuit pocket, a can of dog food with his fishing tackle. On the Doddington, he says, \"The other dogs and the other owners know my dogs. They know my dogs aren't fighting dogs. But when push comes to shove, my dogs will look after themselves. You can't steal them. A lot of that goes on. Stealing for dogfighting.\" </p> <p>Pete's friend Ted is fishing next to him. Ted is 58 and has a rottweiler. \"The Doddington is a good estate,\" he insists; he has lived on it since he helped build it in the 70s. \"Everyone knows everyone. But it's got a lot worse when it comes to dogs. Loads of owners want them to fight. Young kids.\" The preferred part of the estate for dogfights is a low, echoing pedestrian tunnel under the railway tracks. Neither end is overlooked by many windows. Ted says half a dozen dead dogs have been found there in recent years.</p> <p>Yet the dogfighting craze on the Doddington and similar London estates is not quite dogfighting in the traditional sense. The latter has long involved established dogfighting rings, the placing of bets and gory confrontations in converted basements at secret addresses. The new version is often more about show and machismo than actual violence. \"They call it 'chain-fighting' or 'rolling',\" Callis says. \"You get 20 or 30 youths, late at night. They put the dogs on thick chain harnesses. They bait them to attack each other. But they hold them back, inches apart. Staffordshire bull terriers - they scream and howl and whine like babies. But there's no fighting, unless something goes wrong and a hyped-up dog gets loose. Then you see dogs with front facial injuries. In a proper dogfight, where one dog usually ends up on top of another, you would see injuries to the back of the neck.\" Rolling is not illegal until it causes a public disturbance. \"Then the police turn up,\" Callis says, \"and everyone scarpers.\"</p> <p>Staffs have associations with fighting and lawlessness going back two centuries. The breed evolved in the Midlands from around 1800 as a cross between the bulldog, which was used for bull- and bear-baiting, and the nimbler old English terrier. \"People wanted the fierceness and strength of the bulldog, but a less cumbersome dog,\" says Beaufoy of the Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club. The resulting \"pit dogs\" and \"bull and terriers\", as they were initially known, were bred to fight each other for money. After dogfighting was made illegal in Britain in 1835, the dogs and the practice remained popular with, as Beaufoy puts it, \"villains in poor areas who stayed one step ahead of the police\".</p> <p>But the breed was also found to have a strongly affectionate side and this, together with its boisterous, blunt-nosed, no-nonsense doggishness, gradually turned the staffordshire bull terrier, as the breed was finally christened in 1935, into a respectable pet in Britain and abroad. Beaufoy has 10 of them: \"The stafford is clean. It's highly adaptable. It can live in a flat. It will live without much exercise. I've handled tens of thousands all over the world and I've never been bitten.\" </p> <p>He acknowledges, though, that the dogs can be volatile. \"Once a stafford's been bitten, it doesn't get bitten twice. A good owner would not have his dog off the lead. In the wrong hands, a stafford could quickly be turned into a fighting machine again.\" </p> <p>At Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home, five minutes' walk from the Doddington, some of the consequences of the vogue for staffs among what Beaufoy calls \"macho people\" are deafeningly obvious. Almost every dog in the kennel block I visit is a yelping, panting staff or staff cross. \"We're pretty much overrun by them,\" Taylor says. \"We get staffies brought in by people who say, 'He's no good. He's good with dogs. He won't bark. Have you got anything that does?'\" </p> <p>The fashion for rough dogs means more and more people are breeding them at home for cash. The internet, or word of mouth on a close-knit estate such as the Doddington, does the rest. Prices have fallen low enough for even young teenagers to afford the dogs. Boys buy puppies for their girlfriends, or vice versa. \"Often parents won't have the dogs in the house,\" a teenage girl on the estate tells me. Then the dogs are passed around between friends and relations, or sold and resold, or simply abandoned as too much trouble.</p> <p>Faced with this world of shifting owners' addresses and confusing breeds and crossbreeds, British legislators and law and order bodies have struggled. The 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act, drafted with infamous haste after two vicious and much-publicised attacks on people by pit bull terriers, banned the breeding and sale of \"pit bull terrier type dogs\" and three more obscure Japanese and South American breeds. But the vagueness of some of the law's language, and the fact that many existing owners of forbidden breeds simply did not register their dogs with the police as the act required, means that, 17 years on, when any \"dangerous dog\" alive in Britain in 1991 ought to be long dead, there are almost certainly far more of them than in the early 90s.</p> <p>This month, Wandsworth council, which is responsible for the Doddington and has long been a pioneering Conservative local authority, has started addressing the problem in an innovative way. All new council tenants in the borough who have dogs are now required to have a microchip the size of two grains of rice inserted into their dog's neck. The dog owner's name and address are entered into a database; any dog then found lost or abandoned or misbehaving is scanned and its owner identified. Wandsworth intends steadily to extend the scheme, which already exists in voluntary form, to all its council tenants. People who refuse to register their dogs will ultimately face eviction. \"We're probably going to have a few people banging on about civil liberties,\" Callis says. </p> <p>There may also be unease that the scheme effectively discriminates against council tenants: dog owners in other properties, however irresponsible, will not be required to have their dogs chipped. The council responds that its estates are where the worst dog problems are, and where it has the most power to do something about them. \"Microchipping is a start,\" council leader Edward Lister says. \"There ought to be some sort of fit and proper person test for ownership of a dog.\" </p> <p>There is no sign of that, at least under the current government. The British dog licence was abolished 21 years ago, in part because only a minority of owners were bothering to get one. On the Doddington estate people are unsure that microchipping will make much difference. \"They're going to need a lot more than chipping,\" says a suave young man with a staff as he polishes his convertible. He throws his arms wide: \"Dogs are just like us, some good, some bad. When I'm walking along, people see a black guy with a staffy blah blah blah, but when they speak to me, they realise I'm all right.\" </p> <p>Why has he got a dog? He talks about companionship and getting out of the house and meeting other owners. \"And,\" he says, \"you need a dog to protect yourself and your home. No one's going to bother me with a knife if I've got a big dog.\" </p> <p>Tied up outside the supermarket on the estate is one of the biggest, most intimidating dogs I've ever seen: brown, cannonball headed, hip high. Its silver chain is half as thick as my arm. Its owner is nowhere in sight. Then he saunters out of the supermarket, bulky and tall, carrying two huge bags of dog food. Four other teenagers follow, all baseball caps and spliff smoke. The owner unties the dog and leads the group towards the tower blocks. </p> <p>I stop him and ask what sort of dog it is. \"French mastiff,\" he says. \"Mastiff de Bordeaux.\" Why did he get it? \"I just like big dogs. If you're walking down the street, people move out of the way.\" How does he feel about that? He gives a cold look: \"If people move, that's their business.\" Then his expression softens. \"There was a French mastiff in that Tom Hanks film,\" he says. \"Turner &amp; Hooch.\"</p> <p>There is something cartoonish and blustering as well as menacing about the rough dog culture. \"There is one dog on this estate called Killer,\" three teenage girls with staffs on the Doddington tell me. \"And there's Bullet. There's Trigger...\" </p> <p>As we stand talking by the stairwell of the girls' block, their staffs scampering delightedly up and down the slide in an adjacent playpark, the girls switch constantly between chilling specifics about dog behaviour on the estate and what sounds a little like hearsay or urban myth. \"People around here feed their dogs tripe to make them look muscly. They pinch their back legs to wind them up. They use special codewords to get them to attack: 'Where's the money?'; 'Shake him'; 'Where's the cats?' Or they keep them locked in cages, so they don't see other people. When they let the dogs out, they go mad. But then other people think that if you keep the dogs in cages, they don't grow...\"</p> <p>\"Probably about 10% of young problematic dog owners are a hardcore, involved in crime and antisocial behaviour,\" Callis says. \"We're never going to change them. The rest aspire to be tough, or just really like their dogs and get roped in.\"</p> <p>Over on the Doddington estate, the man with the convertible and staff thinks that the rough dog craze has almost run its course. \"This dog thing, it's dying off,\" he says, polishing his car as his staff watches, sitting quietly, carefully muzzled. \"There's too many dogs.\" Tough dogs seem less tough when everyone you know has one.</p>",

  "<p>How much difference will the departure of George W Bush make to the politics of climate change? The answer as of today is: not enough. Both candidates for his job have acknowledged the need for action, but not such as to threaten the inalienable right of US motorists to cheap gas. And the boldest initiatives that now seem politically feasible in America will scarcely make a dent in the problem.</p> <p>For one thing, there is much less of a consensus in the US about the nature of the threat than exists in Europe, and powerful vested interests stand in the way. Four of the key swing states - Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and West Virginia - are built on coal, while others such as Iowa have big biofuel interests.</p> <p>For another, the sheer complexity of America's energy system is a serious barrier to progress. To take one example, there are more than 3,000 separate electric utility companies spread across the country, all of them given incentives to sell as much power as possible from the cheapest energy sources. There are three regional grids, with limited interconnection. And there are armies of sometimes competing regulators, at local, state and federal level.</p> <p>Hence the importance of Thomas Friedman's new book. In many ways, it's a maddening read for Europeans, and not just because it ignores the EU and the lead that it has taken on this issue. Friedman's style is all-American. He believes the vital role of the US is to stand as \"a beacon of hope and the country that can always be counted on to lead the world in response to whatever is the most important issue of the day\". But his arguments are pitched squarely at American readers, and his is an influential voice. His last book, The World is Flat, became required reading in the corner offices of Fortune magazine, and his latest offering is designed to win over the same sceptical audience.</p> <p>The starting point is that ending America's addiction to oil is not just an environmental necessity - it is also a strategic and economic imperative. Oil dependency makes dictators stronger, democratic countries weaker and radical terrorists richer. Rather than staying on this course, business and the country as a whole should see the development of a clean energy infrastructure as a source of competitive advantage. Friedman claims that the greatest thing that the US could do today for itself, and for the whole world, would be to announce its intention to \"outgreen China\" - by taking a commanding lead in the race to build the next great global industry: clean power.</p> <p>Not only would such a goal bring strategic, economic and environmental benefits, it might also help to strengthen the role of civil society in China, as citizens start to speak out against environmental excesses. \"The Chinese Communist party will not be able to deliver on its promise to its people of the freedom to breathe unless it gradually but steadily starts to grant more of them the freedom to speak.\" And the best way to do all this is not through rules and regulations, or international treaties, but by way of \"the most effective and prolific system for transformational innovation and commercialisation of new products ever created on the face of the earth - the US marketplace\". </p> <p>Friedman's big idea is the creation of what he calls the energy internet - a world in which consumers of electricity will be empowered by innovative technology to maximise energy efficiency, choose different sources of supply at different times and at different prices, and sell any power they generate themselves back into the grid. Most of what's needed already exists, at least on paper: the challenge is to bring down the cost and change the rules to make it all possible.</p> <p>All this is aimed at those who think climate change is a hoax devised by pony-tailed tree-huggers. Technology and America's spirit of innovation will do the trick, and bring economic benefits into the bargain. But it's not enough to rely on market forces, at least in the way that they currently operate. Friedman recognises the vital role for government, in introducing demanding targets to spur industrial change; in setting standards to raise the energy efficiency of goods and services; above all, in giving price signals that the market needs in order to operate effectively. That could mean the introduction of a carbon tax, a floor price for oil, a cap and trade system for reducing greenhouse gas emissions - or some combination of all three. California has started down this road. But it will be a very hard sell across the rest of the US, as Senators Warner and Lieberman found with the failure of their attempted legislation this summer.</p> <p>Even the ever-optimistic Friedman occasionally seems daunted by the scale of the challenge. There are no quick fixes, despite the flood of US publications offering articles such as \"205 Easy Ways to Save the Earth\". The US is going to have to redefine its ideas of a middle-class lifestyle and set a very different example to the world. But in doing so, Friedman suggests, it can rediscover its sense of national purpose. As short-term economic problems pull political and public attention away from long-term threats to the environment, America needs a forceful advocate like Friedman to make this case for change.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard Lambert is director general of the CBI</p>",
  "<p>For much of his career John le Carr\u00e9 has been pigeonholed as a practitioner of genre fiction. But whereas the spy novel has traditionally induced an appealing but limited frisson of fear in the reader, presenting a threat to the moral and political establishment which is then resolved by the triumph of the hero and the state whose interests he represents, Le Carr\u00e9 has never dealt in comfort or certainty. His novels depict a bleak world in which the clarity of ideology, morality, patriotism, professional duty and personal loyalty dissolves into a fog in which his characters flounder, groping for some sort of basis on which to live and act. In this respect his work feels closer to postwar existentialism or the central European absurdist tradition than the kinetic action thrillers or puzzle-solving whodunits with which it is often shelved.</p> <p>With the end of the cold war there were those who wondered whether Le Carr\u00e9 would survive the collapse of the binary opposition which gave his fictional grey area its compelling atmosphere. From the 1990s onwards, in novels such as The Constant Gardener, he turned his attention to the new nexus of corporate and state power, the decentralised network of interests which have gone on to define the 21st century global order. Now, as the contours of the post-9/11 state of emergency become clear, he has published his 21st novel, A Most Wanted Man, which deals with the war on terror and its attendant abuses. It opens as a Turkish immigrant couple in Hamburg reluctantly take in a young Russian vagrant, a devout Muslim called Issa, who says he is from Chechnya. Issa's presence in Germany is a mystery. He has been smuggled across the border, bears the psychological and physical scars of torture, and is carrying a large sum of money. Is he a militant? A refugee? Is his unworldly persona in fact an elaborate cover for something more sinister? Drawn into his orbit are several recognisable Le Carr\u00e9 types. Annabel Richter is a young and idealistic immigration lawyer who takes Issa on as a client, hoping to prevent his deportation. Gunther Bachmann is an experienced intelligence agent, who sees the boy as a thread which he can pull to unravel a complex skein of jihadi finance. Tommy Brue is the ageing Scottish head of a small private bank, an old-fashioned operation which has a number of financial skeletons in its closet.</p> <p>The fact that these people feel immediately familiar to his fans is both Le Carr\u00e9's strength and his weakness. Bachmann the spy is sketched in a few paragraphs, which are both rich in incidental detail (\"[he] had by the age of 30 run away to sea, trekked the Hindu Kush, been imprisoned in Colombia, and written a thousand-page unpublishable novel\") and somehow perfunctory. Brue and Richter are more interesting, affording the author an opportunity to pick at scabs of class and status to get at the wounds beneath. Richter is the daughter of a senior diplomat, and her radicalism seems to be a way of escaping her privileged background. Brue, the nearest thing in the novel to an authorial proxy, is trapped in the ossified world of European old money and falls in modest and distant love with her, taking on her problems, and discovering that \"in doing so he had consciously and deliberately entered her danger zone, which he now shared with her. And in consequence, his life had become vivid and precious to him, for which he thanked her from all his heart.\"</p> <p>In a recent interview Le Carr\u00e9 was asked if he ever considered defecting. \"Well, I wasn't tempted ideologically ... but when you spy intensively and you get closer and closer to the border ... it seems such a small step to jump ... and, you know, find out the rest.\" Though this has been reported as some sort of tabloid confession (\"I was tempted to defect, says spy novelist Le Carr\u00e9\"), it seems primarily interesting as a key to his fiction, whose central concern is the exploration of the metaphorical borderland occupied by the proponents of any polarised conflict. In the cold war, the security establishment was deeply invested in proclaiming the evils of communism. Why? Le Carr\u00e9 offers the wry suggestion that it was prophylactic: they beat the drum for certainty because they understood the perilous ease with which they - in particular, the cold warriors - could slip over to the other side, the small step it would take to find themselves in the communist mirror-world. So the pathological anti-communist becomes, like the swaggering homophobe, a figure of insecurity, protesting loudly and too much. And the ordinary spy, a man perhaps like the young John Cornwell, toiling in his Bonn office, immersed in the minutiae of the system on which he is spying, finds the bureaucratic abstraction of his task leading to a sort of Marxist disillusionment, as evinced in the Communist Manifesto: \"All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.\"</p> <p>As a key to A Most Wanted Man, Marx's apprehension of the brutal truth of human social relations can usefully stand alongside another famous quotation, EM Forster's statement that \"If I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend, I hope that I should have the guts to betray my country.\" Betrayal and the conflict between different kinds of loyalty form one recurrent theme of Le Carr\u00e9's fiction. The all-too-human desires of his characters - for loyalty, love and friendship - become terrible vulnerabilities when exposed to the \"real conditions of life\", the inhumanity of the realpolitik that governs the secret world.</p> <p>In A Most Wanted Man, such vulnerabilities are ruthlessly exploited. The novel's centre, the damaged young man known as Issa (whose name, significantly, is an analogue of Jesus), becomes a kind of blank screen for the hopes, fears and desires of the banker, the lawyer and the spy. At times his plight makes him genuinely poignant. At others he is little more than a cipher, a faint echo of Prince Myshkin in The Idiot, a \"monk with coal-dark eyes\" who speaks in a wildly uneven linguistic register, sometimes childlike, sometimes incongruously using words such as \"malodorous\". Issa is another incarnation of a familiar Le Carr\u00e9 type, the loose cannon, someone whose psychological precariousness and social disconnection make them disruptive of the established order - and useful to the puppeteers of the human soul who run the intelligence services. Some of Le Carr\u00e9's agents are people for whom this is an active talent - Jerry Westerby in The Honourable Schoolboy, Leamas in The Spy Who Came In From The Cold. Others, such as the actress Charlie in The Little Drummer Girl, are mere pawns in the intelligence game. Here Issa's passive unworldliness is a trait that destabilises the very worldly people who are drawn to him, inducing a sort of sentimental nobility that opens them up to tragedy.</p> <p>As ever, Le Carr\u00e9 is particularly good at portraying the quiet ruthlessness of intelligence organisations, and the terror of the moment when an unsuspecting person drops through the trapdoor that separates the everyday world from the secret one. He understands the ecstasy of confession (\"there was a certain relief, even pleasure, in becoming a child again, in handing the big decisions of her life to people older and wiser than herself\") and the subtleties of the relationship between interrogator and subject. The exploitation of human weakness both fascinates and disgusts him, and he is able to weave the familiar elements of his fictional universe into a plot that unwinds satisfyingly and with a certain sickening inevitability. A Most Wanted Man is an uneven book, but despite its flaws it stands as one of the most sophisticated fictional responses to the war on terror yet published, a humane novel which takes on the world's latest binarism and exposes troubling shades of grey.</p> <p>\u2022 Hari Kunzru's latest novel is My Revolutions (Penguin)</p>",
  "<p>Share prices may have taken a pounding, but the financial crisis is sending savings rates shooting up - with some accounts now paying more than 7%. Britain's high street banks were this week falling over themselves to offer attractive deals as they seek to pull in new business and replenish their coffers.</p> <p>NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland led the charge with a stack of new and improved offerings, while Alliance &amp; Leicester and Lloyds TSB are among the other institutions holding out the carrot of tasty rates. \"They say every cloud has a silver lining, and out of the chaos of last week comes excellent news for savers,\" says Kevin Mountford at the website moneysupermarket.com. \"The market really is hotting up, and the latest offerings reflect the ongoing desire of institutions to fight hard for retail savings.\"</p> <p>It seems the high street is fighting back after years when the savings market was dominated by new entrants, many of them based overseas. Some savers may worry that banks offering really good rates are only doing so because they are in trouble. Others will feel safe in the knowledge that the Financial Services Compensation Scheme would step in if their bank went bust (see page 3). If you are worried, you may want to opt for one of the \"too big to fail\" players (maybe Barclays should revive the \"A big world needs a big bank\" TV ads featuring Sir Anthony Hopkins).</p> <p>Here's our guide to some of the new deals on offer. Rachel Thrussell at financial data provider Moneyfacts points out that many of these deals involve interest bonuses that only last a year. She says people should remember that once the bonus is gone, the rate you are left with may be less than impressive. </p> <p>7%-plus Royal Bank of Scotland - a pretty big bank by anyone's standards - is offering a rate of 7.25% in a bid to encourage people to transfer their cash Isas. The bank says it is quick and easy to move your cash Isa to RBS using its \"hassle-free\" transfer service. \"Simply complete the form [on the website] and take it into your local branch,\" it says. And RBS is offering instant access to your money.</p> <p>Of course this deal has strings attached. The rates on offer - 6.25% to 7.25% gross - are boosted by a 2% bonus that lasts for only 12 months. And to get 7.25%, you would need to have a balance of at least \u00a324,000, which will be well beyond many of us. For those with between \u00a33,000 and \u00a38,999, the rate (including the temporary bonus) would be 6.45%.</p> <p>The bonus is paid in two instalments: at the end of March 2009 and March 2010. NatWest cash Isas are excluded from the deal.</p> <p>NatWest (part of the RBS group) has been advertising a similar offer in which it will pay up to 7.13% gross (7.32% AER) if you move your existing cash Isa over to it. This rate is also boosted by a 2% bonus for 12 months, and applies to balances of \u00a327,000 or more. If you have a smaller nest-egg, the rate is between 6.51% and 6.98%. To take advantage of this deal, you will need to hold, or open, a NatWest instant access account. Interest is paid monthly and transfers within the RBS group are excluded.</p> <p>6.6% NatWest and RBS have both launched two-year fixed-rate savings bonds paying 6.6% aimed at people looking for a \"safe haven\" for \u00a310,000 or more, and who don't mind tying their money up for a couple of years. Interest is paid either monthly or annually, and you need to have a NatWest/RBS current or savings account.</p> <p>If that doesn't appeal, Alliance &amp; Leicester this week unveiled an internet-only savings account called eSaver Issue 2 which also pays 6.6%, - and this rate isn't boosted by a short-term bonus. The minimum balance is just \u00a31, and the maximum \u00a3500,000. Also, the interest rate is guaranteed to stay at least 0.5% above the Bank of England base rate until the end of February 2010. </p> <p>The downside is that if a withdrawal is made in any month other than July, no interest is earned on the balance for that month. So this is not an account for regularly dipping into.</p> <p>6.31% NatWest says anyone opening its e-Savings online account will now receive an extra 2.09% bonus for 12 months - lifting the rate to 6.31%. You can start saving with \u00a31, the interest rate stays the same no matter how much you save, and there are no penalties for withdrawing your cash, a spokesman says.</p> <p>6% Anyone who opens an RBS Direct Saver instant-access internet account will now get an extra 1.3% bonus for 12 months, giving a headline rate of between 5.25% and 6%, depending on how much you stash away. The minimum balance is \u00a31.</p> <p>5.5% Lloyds TSB is now offering up to 5.5% on its Internet Saver account, though this rate includes a 1.5% bonus for 12 months. You need a Lloyds TSB current account.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:r.jones@theguardian.com\"><br>r.jones@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Born into a place of poverty and conflict, Zohair Abu Shaban, 24, has one ambition that would raise him above the hardship around him: he wants to be a professor of electrical engineering. For most young men born and raised in Gaza City this might seem an impossible dream. No university in Gaza offers any degree above undergraduate level and only the area's top university - the Islamic University - runs an electrical engineering course. </p> <p>Abu Shaban took the course and came first in his year. Then he won a Fulbright scholarship to study for a masters at the University of Connecticut. But he had first to get out of Gaza and it is that challenge that has all but undone his dream. </p> <p>Last year, Israel declared Gaza a \"hostile entity\" after Hamas seized control there. Israel closed the crossings out of Gaza and students such as Abu Shaban were unable to leave. In May, the US state department told the seven Fulbright scholars from Gaza their scholarships were cancelled, until the secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, intervened. In the end, three of the seven reached the US and began studying. Abu Shaban and two others had their visas cancelled, for unspecified reasons. </p> <p>Frustrated but not deterred, he won a place to begin a masters at Imperial College London and has been told to arrive for his course by next Saturday. But Israel still refuses to allow him out of Gaza and the Egyptian border is closed. </p> <p>\"Peace only comes from education and if you steal education from the youth I don't know what future there is,\" Abu Shaban said. </p> <p>After the Fulbright case Israel allowed about 70 students to leave through the Erez crossing, and another 100 crossed out of Rafah in August. Israel's foreign ministry said the restrictions would remain as long as Gaza was ruled by Hamas. \"It is not really about the individual potential of each ... person, the question here is what do you do when there is a territorial entity ruled by a terrorist group that defies you violently ... and refuses to maintain normal relations.\"</p>",
  "<p>I've been reading the Guardian for 28 years. My sister-in-law introduced me to the cryptic crossword and we used to spend time puzzling as a family. Araucaria is my favourite. I'm not really into politics, but I like the way the reporting is less sensationalist than other papers. I always read the sport and I'm a big fan of David Lacey, he writes with a lot of humour.</p> <p>As a Brighton boy I always look out for Steve Bell and I love Eyewitness. It's things like that that make the Guardian just that little bit different. I really liked the rebranding and the extras it gives, like the Guide. It is a pioneer in the field, always looking to add new things, which the other papers end up copying.</p> <p>At the end of October me and a group of friends are doing a 250km sponsored run across the Sahara desert. We are a team of four professionals in the construction industry and we call ourselves the Sandblasters. We're trying to raise \u00a31m for two children's charities by running five events in two years.</p> <p>Desert running is an extreme physical and mental challenge. You are running a marathon every day in temperatures that can get up to 55 degrees. We did our first event running across the Gobi desert in June last year, and we did the Marathon des Sables across the Sahara in Morocco in April. It's just a crazy event with crazy people, but when you finish there is just this amazing sense of achievement.</p> <p>I read the Guardian every day on my commute and get it every weekend, so when we ran the Gobi desert last year it was the longest I had ever been without the paper. The thing I was most looking forward to after we had finished was getting home, sitting down with a pint of Guinness and a copy of the Guardian. </p>",
  "<p>If you want to test the temperature of the high street, look at John Lewis's weekly sales figures. The partnership's department stores have provided accurate readings for years, which is why JJB Sports' problem with its auditors was not the only big retail story yesterday. John Lewis's figures suggest retail sales have fallen off a cliff, as shopkeepers are inclined to say.</p> <p>You only get a glimpse of the story from the 5.6% drop in John Lewis's overall year-on-year sales. That figure includes a 5% gain at the Oxford Street store, where the cheap pound is still bringing in tourists, and a 15% advance in internet sales. Those two parts of John Lewis are one-fifth of the whole.</p> <p>Dig deeper into the numbers and you will see that some John Lewis stores are suffering huge falls. Peterborough was down 20% last week; Nottingham 18%; Bluewater in Kent 16%; Trafford in Manchester 16%; and Edinburgh 14%. </p> <p>John Lewis talks about \"uncertainty in the financial markets\". What it means is that the takeover of HBOS may have been the moment that the penny dropped for shoppers and they started to prepare for tougher times.</p> <p>Note, too, that John Lewis has been cutting prices this year in an effort to keep sales turning over. Many other retailers have held their prices to protect profit margins - in other words, they have been crossing their fingers and hoping that consumers are saving up for a splurge at Christmas. That hope is surely fading.</p> <p>We'll get a better picture next week when Marks &amp; Spencer - another bellwether - reports. If M&amp;S's numbers are as weak as the analysts expect (Investec forecasts \"high single digit\" declines), we can safely say that the consumer recession has arrived.</p> <p><strong>Ready money</strong></p> <p>Relax, don't worry, the Bank of England has got this thing under control.</p> <p>That, at least, was one version of events yesterday as the Bank joined coordinated efforts by central banks around the world to pump funds into the short-term money markets and then added a juicy cherry on top. It said that on Monday it will auction \u00a340bn to be repaid in mid-January. Banks can get their hands on this cash by offering collateral in the form of top-grade mortgages.</p> <p>The significance of all this is that three-month money is the stuff that is in desperately short supply. Central banks have been generous with overnight money, and yesterday also turned on the one-week tap, but such short-term lending doesn't get money flowing through the system.</p> <p>Banks have simply hoarded these short-term funds, fearful that another big banking name could collapse at any moment.</p> <p>The fears are well-founded. On Thursday night, Washington Mutual became the biggest banking failure in US history as the government seized control and sold the banking operations to JP Morgan for $1.9bn. The process was ruthless and smooth, but the splash could be enormous since it is clear that it is not only WaMu's shareholders who will suffer. Some of the bondholders, or their insurers, will be burned, as they were at Lehman Brothers. Banks have another reason to worry about counter-parties.</p> <p>So, will the Bank of England's addition of three-month money kick-start the system? We will only be able to start to guess next week, when we discover the price banks have been willing to pay for their money - the higher the price, the more desperate their need. But the banks can't complain this time that the Bank is being stingy: \u00a340bn is a serious sum.</p> <p>Ultimately, success or failure hinges on whether the auction brings down the three-month Libor rate - the rate at which banks lend to each other. This reading has reached the seemingly absurd level of 6.25% - some 125 basis points above base rate. In normal times, you'd expect to see a 25-point premium. Even at the time of Northern Rock's collapse, three-month Libor reached only 118 points above base rate.</p> <p>So we shall see what next week brings. But the Bank's difficulty is clear. It has thrown oodles of cash at the short-term money market. Now it is throwing oodles at the three-month market. If that doesn't work, there is only one place to go - reduce the price of money by cutting interest rates deeply.</p> <p>The same policy hasn't done much good in the US, the Bank may argue. But how can it tell? Problems in the US might be even worse without 2% interest rates. Chugging along at 5% in the UK - or 6%-plus in real terms - looks very high.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nils.pratley@theguardian.com\">nils.pratley@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Joe Kinnear's startling announcement that he expects to be succeeded by a managerial dream team of Kevin Keegan and Alan Shearer at Newcastle United appeared unfounded last night.</p> <p>On being installed as Keegan's shock interim successor yesterday, the former Wimbledon manager's first act was to declare that he was merely holding the fort while an anticipated takeover was completed and that the new regime aimed to place the two local heroes in charge. He also said that a Nigerian consortium was the preferred choice of Mike Ashley, Newcastle's current owner, to buy the club.</p> <p>Although Keegan's return cannot be entirely ruled out, friends of Shearer revealed that the former Newcastle and England captain was \"in the dark\" about his proposed new role. Moreover Shearer - who rejected a coaching role this year - is understood to have no interest in such a career turn and feels he \"would be mad\" to accept a post there at present.</p> <p>\"I think the club's going to be sold at the beginning of October,\" said Kinnear shortly after signing a short-term contract which runs until November 1. \"My job is to get a few results until the two main people are named. I assume, from the new people coming in, they will be Kevin Keegan and Alan Shearer. \"Mike Ashley made it quite clear to me that he hopes to have the club sold by the beginning of October. He assures me they have a buyer and that the consortium coming in have Kevin Keegan lined up and possibly Alan Shearer.\"</p> <p>Asked by his interviewer to detail what he knew about the Nigerian consortium being fronted by Chris Nathaniel of NVA management, an entertainment company, Kinnear said: \"I'm led to believe that the consortium is their first choice of buyer and that Keegan might come back.\"</p> <p>Nathaniel said last night that the consortium had made an official offer of more than \u00a3200m but City sources continue to cast doubt on the viability of the Nigerian bid and insist that there is interest from the Far East. Keith Harris, the chairman of investment bankers Seymour Pierce and broker of some high-profile foreign take-overs of Premier League clubs, is actively seeking a purchaser after the increasingly beleaguered Ashley signalled his intention to sell. However, it is understood that certain potential purchasers would not wish to re-employ Keegan.</p> <p>Meanwhile Ashley does not want to have to offload a team heading for relegation and, after four successive defeats, Kinnear's appointment is intended to stabilise the team. Out of work for almost four years since resigning from his last job at Nottingham Forest, the 61-year-old is realistic enough to realise he is very much the backstop option, appointed after other managers, notably Terry Venables and Glenn Hoddle, turned the post down.</p> <p>\"I'm not daft enough not to know that they've tried everyone else and everybody else has turned their back on it,\" admitted Kinnear, who expects to be in charge for six to eight games. \"What I intend to do, though, is make an instant improvement.The brief to me is to try to steady the ship, to keep the club out of the bottom three. The fans are going to be disappointed by my appointment but my shoulders are broad enough to take any criticism.</p> <p>\"Good luck to Kevin if he's coming back in. He's the fans' choice and they call the tune in many respects. I just hope they realise I'm in there doing the best I can. I've never been involved in a side that's been relegated in my life. I've never been one to back down from a challenge. And this is a big one. The worrying thing for me is that there are nine players injured long-term and all nine would be in the side.\"</p> <p>If that sounds as if he is getting his excuses in early, Kinnear - who will leave Chris Hughton, the caretaker coach, in control of today's game at home to Blackburn Rovers - has good reason to be concerned about Newcastle's prognosis.</p> <p>As Hughton rather pointedly emphasised yesterday, the extreme thinness of the squad is taking a severe toll. \"We did need to bring in more bodies and have a squad which would be able to cope with the demands of the Premier League,\" he said after learning that Obafemi Martins, the Nigeria striker, will be sidelined for six weeks with knee trouble.</p> <p>\"There are injuries at every club and there are teams who have squads who can cope with them.\"</p> <p>Kinnear is no faith healer but he has a reputation for motivation which will be tested to the limit. Judging by Shay Given's reaction yesterday, Newcastle's players are underwhelmed by his installation.</p> <p>\"I don't really know the man,\" said the Republic of Ireland goalkeeper, blowing out his cheeks and shaking his head. \"The club's up for sale and we haven't got a permanent manager, so I wouldn't say I'm pleased.</p> <p>\"I don't know if it [appointing Kinnear] is a good thing or a bad thing, to be honest. In an ideal world we'd like the club sorted out and a permanent manager. We don't know what is happening. There is a lot of uncertainty around the club and it's not helping anyone.\"</p>",
  "<p>Fate has no meaning in Rafael Ben\u00edtez's managerial lexicon but he is prepared to make an exception in the case of Steven Gerrard's 100th goal for Liverpool. Only an errant decision denied the Liverpool captain his milestone against Stoke City at Anfield last weekend. That the opportunity now arises at Goodison Park, a ground where Gerrard has been baited mercilessly in recent years, has caused even Liverpool's arch-pragmatist to believe the outcome may be scripted.</p> <p>\"Maybe his goal against Stoke was disallowed because destiny has been reserved for him to score his 100th goal against Everton,\" said Ben\u00edtez, who takes an unbeaten record across Stanley Park this lunchtime. \"Gerrard can score in any game, he's always a threat even when he's not playing well, but I am sure what happened against Stoke will only motivate him more to score against Everton. Especially in a derby, it would be fantastic for him to get that goal and I believe he can.\" </p> <p>The Liverpool manager controversially substituted the man from Huyton during last season's tempestuous Goodison derby for displaying \"too much passion\" and believes the England midfielder has learned from the experience.</p> <p>\"Gerrard is more mature now and understands he can play with passion but have control of the situation too,\" insisted Ben\u00edtez. \"At that point [in last year's derby]we needed to keep possession against 10 men, we needed to keep control. And it was Lucas [Leiva] - who came on and was calmer and more relaxed - who was able to create our winner. That was an important decision for the team, something I had to do. Maybe this time it will be Steven who wins the game for us.\"</p> <p>Liverpool, if they win, will equal their best six-game start to a Premier League season and Ben\u00edtez added: \"This kind of game, against a rival in a derby, is always a test but if we can win the confidence will be really, really high in the team.\"</p> <h2>Moyes v Ben\u00edtez Advantage Liverpool in the battle for Mersey pride</h2> <p><strong>Dec 11 2004 Everton 1 Liverpool 0</strong></p> <p>Lee Carsley's winner gives Moyes his first victory in the fixture and Everton a first in five years</p> <p><strong>March 20 2005 Liverpool 2 Everton 1</strong></p> <p>Steven Gerrard and Luis Garc\u00eda score in quick succession for Liverpool.

  "<p>One of the biggest successes of this year's Edinburgh festival fringe, Philip Ralph's drama about the second of four alleged suicides at Deepcut army barracks, has renewed the campaign for a full public inquiry. A play about the third suspicious death at Deepcut opens next month in Newcastle. Other Edinburgh fact-based dramas included Scamp Theatre's Charlie Victor Romeo (edited from black box transcripts) and Motherland (based on the testimony of mothers, sisters and wives of British soldiers in Iraq). And the radical dance company DV8's latest show, which plays at the National Theatre from October 29, is based on 85 audio interviews about homophobia.</p> <p>The war on terror brought politics back on to the world stage, and it's no surprise that politics returned to theatrical stages as well. But the predominance and resilience of verbatim, witness and testimony theatre needs explaining. The big subjects of this decade appear to lend themselves to traditional, mimetic representation. So why have so many post-9/11 plays presented their research interviews as reportage rather than dramatising them in scenes? Why is the first question for an audience at a contemporary political play not \"how have they shown the horrors of terrorism and war?\" but \"will it be stools or chairs?\"</p> <p>The rise of a theatre of reportage rather than enactment is all the more surprising in view of what preceded it. In the mid-90s, there was an upsurge of plays characterised by the explicit representation of sex and violence. Dominating the repertoires of theatres all over Europe, what became known as \"in-yer-face\" drama articulated the frustrated agonies of a generation for whom politics was Margaret Thatcher, pleasure was heroin and sex was Aids. </p> <p>Although biodegrading into a parade of plays about young people shooting up and sounding off in south London flats, the early works of this school confronted urgent political questions. Sarah Kane's 1995 Blasted moves from a Leeds hotel into a Balkan war zone. Mark Ravenhill's 1999 Some Explicit Polaroids starts with the release of a 70s activist from a 20-year jail sentence for political violence. Gregory Burke's Gagarin Way is about a group of articulate but incompetent anti-globalisation protesters whose disastrous capture of a company boss is, in part, an exploration of political terrorism.</p> <p>British theatre thus had a vocabulary to deal directly with an international crisis that started with a terrorist outrage and moved on to shock and awe, a crisis whose most memorable images are of private torture and public executions. The theatre's response was to place inverted commas round these bloody happenings, reconstructing them through interviews, or recollecting them in the courtroom: from the Tricycle's continuing series of dramatisations of significant contemporary tribunals (notably, post-9/11, the Hutton inquiry into the death of David Kelly), via strict verbatim dramas such as Robin Soans's Talking to Terrorists and Alan Rickman and Katharine Viner's 2005 play constructed from the emails and journals of anti-war campaigner Rachel Corrie, to interview-based plays such as Gillian Slovo and Victoria Brittain's Guant\u00e1namo: \"Honor Bound to Defend Freedom\". Dozens and dozens of verbatim and witness plays have appeared, many about the war on terror, some about other contemporary issues, following on from Jessica Blank and Erik Jensen's The Exonerated (presented from 2000 to 2005 and now televised), a compilation of the stories of six people wrongly incarcerated on American death rows. True, Ralph sets his Deep Cut in an accurate simulacrum of Private Cheryl James's parents' front room (so, sofas rather than stools) and DV8's To Be Straight With You combines verbatim reportage with dance, animation and film. But these are just variations on a defiantly anti-mimetic theme. </p> <p>It's worth remembering that we have been here before. In the 1950s and early 60s, the Theatre of Fact movement built plays out of documents, particularly trial transcripts. The best-known products of the school were Heinar Kipphardt's In the Matter of J Robert Oppenheimer, a dramatisation of the atom bomb scientist's arraignment for supposed communist sympathies, and Peter Weiss's The Investigation, about the postwar trials of the Auschwitz guards. The theory behind these works was not, however, to explain the phenomena they described. The strategy of using documents as opposed to dramatic invention was a conscious evasion: playwrights were saying that, after the enormities of Auschwitz and Hiroshima, the old concepts of cause and effect no longer apply. All the playwright can do is present the documents for the audience to make of them what it will. In this sense, Theatre of Fact is the other side of the coin of 50s and 60s absurdism. Both forms sought to express phenomena they could no longer explain. </p> <p>It's possible to argue that the anti-theatricality of the Tricycle tribunals, and the minimalism of the interview-based play, get their makers off the hook. Yet far from being an abdication, much journalism-posing-as-theatre is literally and proudly that. In the 2003 play about railway privatisation, The Permanent Way, David Hare and his collaborators did the kind of in-depth, investigative, historically analytical job on a contemporary political story that conventional journalism rarely does any more, occupying space abandoned both by long-form print journalism and by traditional television documentary. In Deep Cut, reporter Brian Cathcart is quoted as saying that \"journalism dropped the ball\" after the internal inquiry into the four deaths, implying that theatre has now picked it up.</p> <p>Similarly, you could say Hare's 2004 play about the build-up to the invasion of Iraq, Stuff Happens, was performing the role that television drama-documentary has performed in the past. Drama-documentary was developed by Granada in the 70s to report stories that could not be portrayed by conventional journalism; since then its priorities have shifted from doc to dram. There continue to be occasional, effective drama-docs about contemporary public events, such as Antonia Bird, Ronan Bennett and Alice Perman's The Hamburg Cell (about the 9/11 bombers), Peter Kosminsky's The Government Inspector (about the suicide of David Kelly) and Michael Winterbottom's The Road to Guant\u00e1namo. But they have largely degenerated into the dubious retelling of titbit scandals about government ministers or soft-edged biopics of royal and political celebrities. In 1971, the producers of Granada's first drama-doc (about a Soviet dissident incarcerated in a mental hospital) assured its viewers that \"All the incidents and conversations which follow are exact transcriptions.\" The disclaimer for a 2005 drama about Princess Margaret was: \"Some of the following is based on fact. And some isn't.\" Journalistically rigorous theatrical drama-doc certainly has space to occupy. </p> <p>And far from evading polemic, fact-based theatre has tended to make clear where it stands, thereby making an impact beyond the usual audience for political theatre. Long before Sherman Cymru reopened the Deepcut case, the Times mounted a campaign for the subsidised theatre to be obliged to preserve the kind of political \"balance\" that is incumbent on the BBC. Following an unexpectedly successful West End run, Guant\u00e1namo: \"Honor Bound to Defend Freedom\" was an even less expected hit on Broadway (with Archbishop Desmond Tutu making a couple of guest appearances). My Name is Rachel Corrie caused outrage (for and against) when a New York theatre withdrew its production, fearful of Jewish reaction to the story of an American woman crushed under an Israeli bulldozer.</p> <p>These campaigning achievements have been complemented by something deeper. Fact-based theatre calls attention to, and thus questions, the credibility of the evidence on which we base our view of the world. Unlike naturalistic drama, which invites us to suspend disbelief, verbatim drama wears its sources on its sleeve. At a time when people are highly distrustful of public information, the presentation of witnesses in the theatre invites us to cross-examine. Testimony theatre can be simultaneously reliant on and suspicious of its raw materials.</p> <p>In this, it's part of a wider canon of contemporary British and Irish plays. One of the ironies of the past 25 years is that, while the academy has been proclaiming the death of linear narrative, the real world has seen a rush towards it. In the 70s, narrative was one of many ways to convey meaning (along with character, metaphor, argument and theme). Now the dominance in the electronic media of narrative genre has virtually eliminated all bearers of meaning beyond what happens next. Far from losing the plot, contemporary popular dramatic fiction appears to have lost pretty much everything else.</p> <p>Theatre's response has been neither to follow nor to reject the narrative urge, but to question its credentials. Sebastian Barry writes memory plays in which the dying bring back their past and present ghosts at the moment of death. Conor McPherson's 1997 The Weir was about three men who tell fake ghost stories and a woman who shocks them and us by telling what appears to be a true one. My own play about Albert Speer (2000) saw a man constructing his take on his past life in act one, only to have the other characters challenge and undermine in it in act two. Martin Crimp, at the end of his latest play, The City, reveals that the story we've been watching was a fictional invention by one of the characters.</p> <p>Similarly much verbatim theatre is double-coded, not just sourced from interviews but about the interview process, questioning how retrospect recasts the past. Alecky Blythe's 2003 Come Out Eli, a play about an east London siege in which the actors literally have earpieces on which the original interviews are played as they speak them, was as much about the process as the product. Gregory Burke's highly praised play for the National Theatre of Scotland about the Black Watch's tour of duty in Iraq has scenes that represent the interviews on which the play is based, with the \"writer\" as a character. Increasingly, the Tricycle tribunals emphasised the contrast between the coolness of the inquisitive form and the heat of the events they seek to explicate. The latest and last Tricycle tribunal play - Called to Account - gave the usual editing treatment to a specially mounted, and in a literal sense fake, trial of Tony Blair for war crimes (the witnesses and lawyers were real, but the event was a construction). Dennis Kelly's Taking Care of Baby, co-produced by Birmingham and Hampstead last year, is a mockumentary, an entirely fictional work about a woman wrongly imprisoned for murdering her baby, which fools the audience for at least half its length that it is a real verbatim drama based on interviews about a real case.</p> <p>There is evidence that theatre might now be expanding its vocabulary, returning to imaginative fiction to confront the issues that verbatim theatre has made its own. Fiona Evans's upcoming play about the third Deepcut death - Geoff Dead: Disco for Sale - is conventionally mimetic. And political drama is moving back into history and (often) away from fact: one of the criticisms of Rebecca Lenkiewicz's successful and controversial National Theatre play about the suffragettes (Her Naked Skin) was that its central characters were fictional, allowing Lenkiewicz to explore the tensions between political activism and personal fulfilment.</p> <p>But despite signs that verbatim theatre has run its course, this year's Edinburgh festival (in general) and Philip Ralph's Deep Cut (in particular) seem to demonstrate the renewal of a form that has had consistent dramatic as well as journalistic impact for the past seven years. Its visual aesthetic is increasingly informing conventional, fictional theatre, spreading its influence beyond its own product. While conventional journalism continues to drop the ball, and television drama remains (largely) mired in genre, the stools and chairs may not be finally stacked for a while.</p>",
  "<p>What do you do if you are a three times-married struggling single mother called Erin Brockovich and Julia Roberts adopts your name, wins an Oscar for the movie and makes you one of the best known women in the world with a film that has taken more than $256m (\u00a3140m)? Do you: (a) change your life and become an instant celebrity? (b) make some vapid TV shows and write an autobiography, or (c) become one of America's leading environmental campaigners?</p> <p>All three, if you are the real Erin Brockovich, the once lowly-paid, unqualified legal clerk whose investigation brought the giant Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E) company to its legal knees - after she exposed how it dumped the carcinogenic chemical hexavalent chromium into unlined pits which polluted drinking water near the desert town of Hinkley, in California. </p> <p>Going back to Hinkley over and over again, she dug out hundreds of people suffering everything from nosebleeds and cancers to Hodgkin's disease, miscarriages and spinal deterioration. She herself got rashes after drinking the water. \"I could actually see people, animals and trees dying. I have been to the funerals,\" she says. </p> <p>Although it is hard to pin specific illnesses on any one chemical or company, the untutored Brockovich - who dropped out of college - succeeded, and it eventually cost PG&amp;E more than $650m (\u00a3350m) in civil lawsuits, the last of which has only just been concluded.</p> <p>The poisoned residents got payouts of about $100,000 each, but Brockovich struck gold. There was a $2.5m bonus and promotion to research director of the law firm; there was a mansion in the Californian hills, and the bestselling memoir. There was a mini-break into TV in the style of Anneka Rice; and thousands of requests from communities around the world to help them, too. </p> <p>But personal dramas carried on following the former Miss Pacific Coast beauty queen around. Within months of the movie coming out in 2000, she had divorced her husband. Soon afterwards another former husband and an ex-boyfriend were arrested and charged, along with a lawyer, with trying to extort $310,000 from her. The lawyer was jailed for six months and disbarred for life, but charges against the other two were dropped. </p> <p>Brockovich admits an equal instinct for trouble and glamour. Perhaps it's the way she stands 6ft tall, and wears four-inch high heels and literally talks down to most men, but she helped shake up the earnest US environmental movement.</p> <p>\"We had this idea of what a hero or an environmental advocate should be.

But you don't have to have a PhD to be a humanist,\" she says. </p> <p>She now works for two law firms, one in LA the other in New York, both of which specialise in toxic exposure and the kind of mass torts or civil actions used against PG&amp;E. \"I get thousands of emails. Half my work is environment-related, the rest is pharmaceutical problems. There's so much of it. No one law firm can handle it now\". This week she has been in Europe, meeting the Irish environment minister and giving motivational lectures. Her speciality is water, and she is currently fighting two water pollution cases in Italy and Greece. \"It dawned on me then that we were destroying the very element needed for life - water. For me being green means cleaning up the water. Water is the key. Start with water. You can't ignore the fact that that nearly 80% of US waterways are potentially poisoned - benzene, solvents, heavy metals, pharmaceuticals ...</p> <p>\"I get thousands of requests from people near hex chromium sites. There's one in Cork. In Italy there are five. There's a huge one in Greece with readings 10 times higher that at Hinkley. Hell, the river there runs purple! We're about to take out a class action.\"</p> <p>What you really need, and she's got, she says, is stick-to-it-ive-ness. \"It's a noun. It means dogged persistence. Stubbornness. This is what I was taught. I was dyslexic, the least likely to succeed. It means things don't just happen, you have to make them happen.\"</p> <p>Which is why she is currently causing a stir in political circles in the US. Although she rates herself as a leading environmentalist, she is extremely keen on Sarah Palin, the huntin', shootin' Alaskan governor running for vice president with the Republican candidate John McCain. </p> <p>Environmentalists have painted Palin as the arch-enemy, to the right of Bush, because until last week she was denying climate change had anything to do with man, thought polar bears could go live on land and wants to see the Arctic drilled to within a quart of its oil. </p> <p>But Palin is also being called the \"Erin Brockovich of Alaska\" and last week, on her blog, Brockovich came close to endorsing Palin. \"Sure, she may be loud. So am I,\" she said. \"Sometimes you've got to scream to get anyone to hear you. So what if her 17-year-old is pregnant? None of us should judge Sarah Palin for anything but her own actions.\"</p> <p>What about her wanting to drill the arctic reserve? What about the bears and wolves that Palin shoots? </p> <p>\"No buts,\" says Brockovich. \"The fact is that Sarah Palin positively emanates strength. She gives off the aura of being a strong woman who doesn't back down, and she does it sporting heels and wearing her family like a badge of honour. I am sure there are a million other women out there who are doing the same thing.\" </p> <p>The blogosphere went wild, with people applauding or accusing. She denies moving to the right, pointing out that she's a registered Democrat, and says she'd be elated if asked to work with the Democrats. \"But it's not about politics. I don't pick a person because they are a Republican or a Democrat but for the person. I like Obama. I like McCain. Both have strong points\".</p> <p>Her real beef is neither capitalism nor industry, Democrats nor Republicans, she says, but greed. </p> <p>\"It's not that industry is bad. If we shut it down we do not progress. Greed is the problem. If PG&amp;E had done the right thing morally then we'd never have had this lawsuit, lives would have been saved and they would not have been out of $1bn. That's just bad business. Honesty hurts, but it's at least respectful of people. I see no change at all in industry.\"</p> <p>Sometimes she goes back to Hinkley. \"But I prefer not to. The chemical is still in the environment, the plume [of pollution] is still moving. The company is still buying houses there. I am the canary in the mine shaft. I still get rashes.\" </p> <p>The beauty queen once expected to parade and keep quiet now finds herself confused and angered by what is happening in the US and the priorities of people with power and influence. \"We have the money and the intelligence. We can find hundreds of billions of dollars [to bail out banks] but we can't find anything to clean up our water, the one element that sustains all life. I just don't get it.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Pick of the week:<br>Jordin Sparks, Tattoo (Sony BMG) </h2> <p>When she's not calling for Russell Brand's hirsute mug on a plate, abortions to be made illegal and disappointing all the Bratz- channelling prositots by showing off her virginity like it was a shiny new coat, Sparks is actually quite a good pop star. If No Air was her Crazy In Love, Tattoo is her Irreplaceable; it follows R&amp;B's brave new world of meshing gospel vocal and Europop circa Ace Of Base's The Sign. Lovely.</p> <h2>Steve Mac, Paddy's Revenge (All Around The World) </h2> <p>About as subtle as partners in Lehman Brothers doing a version of Money, Money, Money with tills littering the chorus, this Irish-themed trance \"anthem\" is a whole bagful of wrong. The risible video features every Oirish cliche you can think of: ACTUAL LEPRECHAUN (check), Riverdancing lasses (check), rainbows with pots of gold at the end (check). Reports that the Frosted Lucky Charms man refused to appear because it was \"verging on the jingoistic\" could not be confirmed. </p> <h2>Boyzone, Love You Anyway (Polydor) </h2> <p>\"Good daytime TV presenter material\", \"Doesn't look too shabby in a Byrite suit\", \"Better than Ronan\": yes, these were the Whisper Therapy tools Shane, Mikey, Stephen and the other one undertook before the Boyzone reunion. Hell, if Madonna and Guy can do it, why couldn't they? Despite blurting these sweet nothings into each other's ears at random points in the day, Ronan still gets the lead vocal. And it sounds exactly like Back To Black played in the key of F. Weird. </p> <h2>The Rascals, I'll Give You Sympathy (Deltasonic) </h2> <p>Here's a three-point plan for the Rascals to get singer Miles Kane's attention back from Alex Turner. 1) Give him as good as he gets! Next time Kane says, \"Oh, I can't make rehearsal. I've got another Last Shadow Puppets awards ceremony to go to,\" hit him back with, \"Yeah? Well, I'm actually making a solo album with Drew from Babyshambles thankyouverymuch. And Mick Jones is producing.\" 2) Dress up. See him swanning off in his vintage suit arm in arm with Turner? What would he do if he saw you wearing, say, a mankini of an evening? Look at you in whole new light, that's what. 3) Or... just beg him to stay. Seriously, if I'll Give You Sympathy is anything to go by, he's totally gonna leave your ass. </p> <h2>Jack White and Alicia Keys, Another Way To Die (SonyBMG)</h2> <p>If the idea of a bleary-eyed, tissue-eating Amy Winehouse incoherently blurting out made-up rhymes with \"quantum\" and \"solace\" wasn't quite such a great image, maybe Alicia and Jack could pull it off. As we all know, Jack hasn't been too interesting since he dressed up like Dick Van Dyke, discovered the bagpipes and buried Meg down a well so he could hang out with Brendon Benson a bit more. And so this tune is just OK. But it does follow in the tradition of Live And Let Die in that the intro goes \"DA! DA! DA!DADADADADDDDDDAAAAA!\" and has some tempo changes. Will probably sound better when some silhouetted ladies are prancing around the opening credits, too.</p>",
  "<h2>Help! After 50 years, HSBC thinks I'm a drugs dealer</h2> <p>My two-year fixed rate bond with Bradford &amp; Bingley matured this month. Because I am 80, I decided I was too old to take risks, so I opted to reinvest it in National Savings &amp; Investments. My local Bradford &amp; Bingley branch was charming. It gave me a cheque for the \u00a360,000 which I then took a few hundred yards along the road to HSBC, where I have a current account.</p> <p>Once the cheque cleared, I was going to transfer the cash to NS&amp;I on the phone via my debit card.</p> <p>The HSBC branch said my cheque would take three days to clear, which I accepted. When I phoned three days later, the bank said the cheque had cleared but I could not spend the money as it had to be investigated for possible fraud and drug-dealing implications. Please help.<br><strong>VA, Lincolnshire</strong></p> <p>What happened to banks knowing their customer? You have been an account holder continuously since 1956 and at your present address for many years. Your late husband, who had a distinguished career in public service, was also an HSBC customer.</p> <p>And what happened to the bank staff's common sense? The cheque was drawn on Bradford &amp; Bingley, which, although it has problems, is hardly the Colombian Cocaine Cartel.</p> <p>You were so worried by the mention of drugs you even offered your doctor's details to HSBC to prove you were not on crack. You take blood pressure pills, and the HSBC call could have pushed you into the danger zone. After around 30 minutes and talking to more than one person, HSBC did allow you to take your cash.</p> <p>It claims staff were \"following procedures\" - seemingly without question - but concedes the talk of drugs and fraud was \"badly worded\" and not well explained. It will now write to apologise for the incident, and send you book tokens to help relax your mind.</p> <p>You now have your NS&amp;I bond.</p> <h2>Saved from that watch ... in the nick of time!</h2> <p>I received a letter last week from Unclaimed Prize Register of Ross-0n-Wye. It said: \"We are holding a cheque for \u00a325,000 or other item that has already been allocated to you.\"</p> <p>It claimed I had entered a previous competition, which was not true.</p> <p>Is there really a cheque for \u00a325,000? As a student, I can't afford to lose anything to find out.<br><strong>LS, Southampton</strong></p> <p>Unclaimed Prize Register (UPR) comes from DM plc, a stockmarket-quoted company which specialises in postal prize draws.</p> <p>Yes, there is a cheque, and \u00a35,000 of premium bonds, a Sony laptop and a big-screen television as well. But these will only be won if your personal code matches the prize's preset number.</p> <p>If no one claims these, the prizes will not be won. To find out, you have to send \u00a319.95. But most people will get a \"Zurich Watch\", a brand that retails at around \u00a35 online.</p> <p>UPR used to ask entrants to phone a premium rate line. </p> <p>Last year Guardian Money quoted regulator PhonepayPlus saying that one of its mailings \"failed to give sufficient prominence to the cost of the call (it's in the small print) and that there should not be emphasis on calling as soon as possible, given the December 31 deadline\".</p> <p>There's still an urge to hurry despite another December 31 deadline. </p> <p>But the premium rate line (and any involvement with regulators) has gone. Instead, you apply by post. And the price has risen from a \u00a39 call and \u00a36.50 postage (\u00a315.50) to \u00a319.95 - an inflation-busting increase of 28.7%.</p> <h2>3-point turn as network says 'sorry'</h2> <p>In April I signed a contract with mobile phone company 3, which was sold over the phone by a Cardiff-based company supplier.</p> <p>It was a mistake. When it arrived I didn't like it, and friends were negative about its network coverage.</p> <p>I immediately got in touch with 3 to return the phone unused and cancel the contract within the 14-day cooling-off period. Since then, 3 has billed me every month, and is using debt collectors. Please help.<br><strong>HB, London</strong></p> <p>You sent the handset back to 3 which did not deny receiving it, or that it was unused. But you should have sent it back to Cardiff. 3 refused to send it to the reseller, insisting it was returned to you. It never arrived, but, even had it done so, you would have been outside the 14-day cooling-off period. All this is confusing, when phone resellers go bust the customer contract is with the network, not the reseller.</p> <p>However, 3 now concedes that you were misadvised and accepts that it should have treated you better. </p> <p>It will write to apologise, call off the debt collectors and send you a pre-paid \"dongle\" for mobile broadband as a goodwill gesture.</p> <h2>Scam that's an accident waiting to happen</h2> <p>I was cold-called today by someone who knew my name and address, telling me someone in my family had been in an accident in the past two years. He claimed repeatedly to be working for a government department, \"The National Investigation Bureau Department\". He stated I had unclaimed compensation to claim.</p> <p>Can this be for real?<br><strong>HS, London</strong></p> <p>No. There is no such organisation in the UK. You would have known if someone in your family had had a serious accident. And if you didn't know, there may have been a reason. In any case, why should you get compensation for someone else's accident?</p> <p>This is a new form of \"advanced fee fraud\" where you are told money is due to you - it's similar to the \"lottery win\" from Spain, except here the caller claims to work for the UK government.</p> <p>If you buy into this, they'll ask for cash to help free up the compensation, and you will be told never to discuss it with anyone to maintain confidentiality. And should you get hooked, they will continue to milk you for every single penny that you have. It's a scam that is based on greed.</p> <h2>Point of interest about bank compensation</h2> <p>In your last edition, you mentioned the Financial Services Compensation Scheme several times in the context of possible problems with savings banks. I want to know if I will get all the interest earned if my bank goes bust? And what happens if the scheme runs out of money?<br><strong>CM, Middlesex</strong></p> <p>The question of interest is not mentioned on the FSCS website. But it's important. The maximum \u00a335,000 under the UK scheme in a bust bank would give nearly \u00a32,000 a year in interest. The FSCS had to ask its lawyers when Capital Letters called. But it appears you should get the interest and your original savings.</p> <p>The scheme is financed by a levy on similar firms and is up for review. A consultation period ended on September 15, which should lead to legislation this autumn, including a likely increase in the savings limit to \u00a350,000 - still far short of the \u20ac100,000 (\u00a379,000) that Irish banks offer.</p> <p>FSCS could run out of money but, by then, all bets will be off as the financial crisis will be so bad the government will have to rescue banks across the board. Or we'll all be bust.</p>",
  "<p>\"The waste remains,\" William Empson wrote in one of his villanelles, \"the waste remains and kills.\" The line might have served as an epigraph for Rose George's book, which looks at the toxic effects of poor sanitation and the heroic efforts of the visionaries who seek to improve it, from Joseph Bazalgette in 19th-century London to his heirs in the developing world today. By \"waste\" she doesn't mean the stuff that goes into wheelie bins or on to landfill sites; she means the unmentionables we flush down the loo - supposing we're lucky enough to have one. </p> <p>\"Shit\" is her preferred usage, rather than excreta, faeces or stools. The topic invites euphemism or tittering toilet humour, but she has an answer to those who think it beneath their dignity: how a society disposes of its sewage tells you a lot about its economy, politics and religion, she says. Disgust may be an understandable reaction (\"Oh! Celia, Celia, Celia shits,\" Jonathan Swift cried in horror), and the author is no coprophagist. But without rubbing our noses in it, she shows how the problems associated with shit are impacting on the Earth.</p> <p>The statistics are horrifying: 2.6 billion people - 40% of the world's population - with no access to a toilet or latrine; 90% of our sewage discharged, untreated, into oceans, rivers and lakes; 10 million viruses and 1 million bacteria in each gram of faeces; every 15 seconds a child dies of diarrhoea caused by contaminated water. In the face of such facts, polite avoidance of the subject seems irresponsible. But persuading people to discuss it openly (as they have learned to with formerly taboo subjects such as sex and death) is a struggle. An advertisement for Velvet toilet tissue in 2002, with artily photographed bare bottoms and the slogan \"Love your bum\", was the second most complained-about ad that year. Celebs will do their bit for WaterAid but not for sanitation. Even those in the industry are shy about admitting it, for fear the rest of us will back away.</p> <p>With no qualifications except an intrepid spirit and a resolve to look and learn, George visits some of the dirtiest places in the world. She goes down among the turds in London's sewers, finding the air surprisingly wholesome but the number of employees or \"flushers\" (a mere 30-odd for the whole of the capital) alarmingly small. She inspects school lavatories in South Africa (where they exist, and are clean, the attendance rate is higher), mingles with untouchables in India (though officially they no longer exist), samples a biogas stove in faeca-philiac China (it runs off converted human excrement), watches latrine pits being emptied in Dar es Salaam (sledgehammers and kerosene do the trick), and handles the sludge used as a fertiliser by American farmers (\"It looks and feels like a crumbled brownie\"). Less gruellingly, she samples state-of-the-art lavatories in Japan, which can check your blood pressure, play music and automatically put the seat down for you, but which have had no more success as an export to the US than the bidet did - to middle America, anal washing seems pervy and louche. Australia is about the only place George doesn't visit, though she does talk to Aussies in the business. Whenever there's a toilet conference, be it in Moscow or Bangkok, there she is with her notebook and an ear cocked for absurdity. </p> <p>Along the way, she explodes a number of myths. That we in the west are well sorted in terms of \"watsan\" (water and sanitation), for instance. Not so: recent years have seen outbreaks of disease from Galway to Milwaukee and catastrophic sewer overflows in London and New York. Nor are developing countries as indifferent to hygiene as popularly alleged: George meets countless evangelists waging war on ignorance, not least in India, where local initiatives have brought sanitation to villagers who used to squat in the bushes or next to ponds. The dream is to create a continent that's ODF, open defecation-free - no more bottoms discharging on to the railway in the slums of Mumbai and elsewhere.</p> <p>Though charmed by the evangelists, George is sceptical of their claims to lasting success. And having listened to the arguments on both sides, she can't decide where she stands on biosolids: are the Americans and Chinese who use human shit as fertiliser noble recycling pioneers or dangerous polluters? The book seems repetitive at times, because of its structure - part travel book, part reportage, part polemic - and it's a pity the notion of waste wasn't broadened out. It's an invaluable contribution nevertheless.</p> <p>\"Shit's shit,\" Andrew Motion once wrote (poets seem better at facing the issue head-on), \"and what we desire in the world is less, not more, of it.\" Less won't happen, with the global population expanding at its current rate. But given that \"sanitation is one of the best investments a country can make\" (good for health, tourism and the economy), it's bewildering how little is spent on it - whether in Pakistan (which spends 47 times more on its military, despite 120,000 diarrhoea-related deaths a year) or in the UK (where sewage systems in many cities haven't changed since Bazalgette). Rose George doesn't pretend to have the answers. But as she prods, pesters and provokes, she proves an excellent shit-stirrer. </p> <p>\u2022 Blake Morrison's South of the River is published by Vintage</p>",
  "<p>When Sean Powell started getting demands for \u00a3300 from British Gas, he thought it must be a joke for one simple reason - there isn't a gas supply to his central London flat.</p> <p>Now, 18 months on, the self-employed property manager is distinctly unamused after the energy giant put a default notice on his credit file - for not paying his non-existent account.</p> <p>But while such an incident would be a serious inconvenience for most people, for Powell the episode has ended a perfect credit record and thrown his business into jeopardy.</p> <p>Unfortunately for him, Powell has become the latest in a growing number of victims who have had their ability to get credit ruined because of a mistake by a large company. </p> <p>Earlier this month we featured a Yorkshire businessman who is suing mobile phone company O2 after it did a similar thing.</p> <p>Powell's story starts in March 2007 when, out of the blue, he received the \u00a3300 British Gas bill. Knowing it to be a mistake - he has no gas appliances, or a meter, and never has had - he pointed all this out in a letter.</p> <p>A second bill soon arrived which, again, was in his name and demanded payment. Again he replied, telling the company it was impossible. After several more demands, including some from debt collectors, he took to phoning British Gas, but got nowhere.</p> <p>\"I even got the managing agent to write a letter to prove there was no gas supply to the whole building - our heating is provided centrally and fired by oil - but still the demands came.\"</p> <p>He says that, having grown tired of constantly phoning, he assumed it would go to court. However, no court summons appeared. Instead, British Gas put a default notice on his credit file - bizarrely, for \u00a373.</p> <p>\"The first thing I knew about it was when I was turned down for a loan. As a regular property buyer, I have been meticulous over the last 14 years in keeping my credit record clean. When it happened for a second time, I got my credit files and, sure enough, there was a default notice saying I had not paid my gas bill.\"</p> <p>Absolutely furious, he got hold of someone in British Gas's debt recovery department, who said he would remove it, but this never happened.</p> <p>\"I'm at the end of my tether. The property market is absolutely flat and at a time when I need to raise money most, I've been scuppered through the incompetence of a company I don't even use. If wasn't so serious, it would be farcical,\" he says.</p> <p>A spokesman for British Gas says the mix-up occurred after the company was wrongly told by National Grid that there was a supply to Powell's flat, although British Gas accepts the error should have been rectified once the company had been made aware of it.</p> <p>\"We've spoken to Powell and apologised. We have removed the default on his credit file and will continue to discuss the situation with him to try and agree suitable compensation,\" he says. Meanwhile, Powell says he will be looking for some recompense to make up for all the time and expense this issue has caused him.</p> <p>\"The loans that I was originally turned down for have at least been resurrected, which is something, but it hasn't exactly helped my reputation with the building society. Also, I haven't been told whether British Gas still want to rummage through my wardrobes to make sure I'm not hiding the meter somewhere,\" he adds</p> <h2>How to check what is on your credit file</h2> <p>Once you've got a default notice on your file, it is notoriously difficult to get it removed, and it can only be taken off by the company that placed it there, according to Espe Fuentes who works for Which? legal services.</p> <p>She says companies are supposed to warn consumers whose accounts are in the red before they apply a default charge to a credit file, but that rarely happens.</p> <p>From October 1, companies will be required to give two weeks' notice (currently one week) before they take such action. Consumers can complain to the Information Commissioner (<a href=\"http://www.ico.gov.uk\">ico.gov.uk</a>, 08456 30 60 60), which has the power to force companies to remove notices.</p> <p>The big three credit agencies will supply your file instantly online.

Add the curry leaves, cardamom, coriander seeds, turmeric, chilli and a teaspoon of salt, and cook and stir for another four minutes on medium heat. Add the rice, stir to coat it in the oil, then pour in the water (it should come 1cm above the top of the rice), cover and bake for 25 minutes. By this point, the rice should be totally cooked.

  "<p>As everyone knows, a successful self-help book cover must feature three things: first, a picture of a gold-encrusted scroll or chest, suggestive of ancient wisdom and untold riches; second, a picture of a smiling person, preferably Paul McKenna, to demonstrate the joy you'll achieve upon reading what's inside; and third, the letters \"PhD\", to reassure you that the author must be very wise because he or she once did a correspondence course in art history from the Internet University of the Cayman Islands. My copy of Judgment Under Uncertainty, edited by Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky and Paul Slovic, fails on all three counts: it's a dry collection of academic studies from 1982, so the cover has a boring, two-tone colour scheme; there's no mention of PhDs. This is a pity, since it may be, unintentionally, one of the most useful self-help books ever published.</p> <p>The researchers' basic point is this: when we lack definite information, we make very poor judgments, and we do so in predictable ways. We're notoriously terrible at assessing risk; we worry about all the wrong things. We fear events that bring vivid imagery to mind, such as terrorism, but not road accidents, though they're far more of a threat. (In studies, people are willing to spend more on travel insurance that would pay out $100,000 for death by terrorism than for insurance that would pay the same for death from any cause.) We fear things we can't control (air accidents) but not things we can (death by smoking). And we believe completely illogical things: most people, Kahneman found, are convinced that the murder rate in Detroit is higher than that in Michigan. </p> <p>Self-help's usual response to worry is to replace a glum or stress-inducing view of the future with an upbeat one: if you're convinced the worst will happen, just convince yourself the best will happen instead! But that rarely works. The findings of Kahneman et al suggest a different approach: rather than trying to change that feeling in your gut from negative to positive, learn to be sceptical of your gut feeling, whether it's negative or positive - because there's good reason to believe your focus is completely wrong. (There are sound evolutionary explanations for why we ended up this way, but our brains were designed for an environment in which we no longer live.)</p> <p>If you're prone to fretting, a simple experiment will reveal how much time you spend worrying about the wrong things. For a week, note down your main recurring fears about the immediate future, then look back and see what really happened. I tried this recently. Things went better than I'd imagined, obviously. But that wasn't the interesting part: what stood out was how many times reality bore no relationship to anything I'd anticipated. I'd worry about some event going badly, but instead of going badly or well, it'd be cancelled. I would worry about how I'd handle some crucial conversation, but by the time it arrived, circumstances had changed, and it wasn't crucial at all. My gut feelings weren't so much overly negative as simply irrelevant. <br><a href=\"mailto:oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com\"><br>oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Patrick Ness buzzes with the same kind of energy as the novel that this week won him the 2008 Guardian children's fiction prize. The Knife of Never Letting Go, his first children's book, is the story of Todd, the only boy in a community of men, who has to flee his home after he discovers a girl in the crocodile-infested marshes that surround his village. It's a book bursting with ideas about adolescence, free will and how we live in a world full of noise and intrusion. For the people in Todd's world, \"the Noise\" intrudes literally - as the result of a \"germ\", they can hear every thought, not only of each other but of animals and birds, too. Some of it is menacing, much of it banal. Todd can never escape the thoughts of others; nor, more dangerously, can he hide his own.</p> <p>With one adult novel and a short-story collection behind him, Ness started The Knife of Never Letting Go with two ideas, one serious and one frivolous. The serious one was about information overload. \"It's so loud,\" he complains. \"We can't get away from emails, texts and the rest.\" The frivolous one came from his childhood dislike of stories about talking animals. To get his revenge - and after observing the way his cat only \"talked\" on the way to and from the litter tray - he was determined to write about a dog who only expresses itself in single words.</p> <p>He then let the ideas \"sit and stew\" for a couple of years while he got on with other kinds of writing, as well as teaching creative writing in Oxford. (An American by birth, Ness has recently taken British nationality.) From this \"stewing\" emerged the characters of Todd and his dog Manchee, along with Todd's idiosyncratic adolescent narrative voice, which sounds American to English readers and English to Americans - a measure of his success in creating a language that he describes simply as \"other\". </p> <p>He admits to being influenced by Russell Hoban's Riddley Walker - a first-person narrative similarly set in a primitive future world. But first and foremost he regards the book as \"a western with some sci-fi settings: it's set in the next natural extension of the wild frontier, complete with troublesome natives.\"</p> <p>With the help of his teenage narrator, he set out to write the kind of book he would have liked to read as a bookworm growing up in Hawaii and Washington state. \"I liked things that were completely strange or pretty rough but which tell the truth,\" he says. He believes it was partly this principle that gave him a connection with a young readership. \"If you treat them right, make the promise that you'll tell the truth - and then do it - they are more than willing to follow you.\" </p> <p>Just as important in the novel is the freedom of every individual to find their own truth. As the child of Christian fundamentalist parents, who spent parts of his childhood in \"a small town in the middle of the ocean with no neighbours at all\", Ness is alert to the paradox of isolation. \"The US has its problems, but the great thing about it is this idea of the frontier: you can still make of yourself what you want without anything holding you back.\" </p> <p>But at the same time, isolation plays into the hands of religious extremists, \"who tell you not to ask and choose\". Though the community Todd grows up in is not primarily religious, it is founded on \"the inability to question\". Reading is forbidden, and Todd is aware that illiteracy takes away his ability to control or interpret his world.</p> <p>The novel is bleak at times, but Ness doesn't see it as grim. \"It's a rough book. There are no jokes in it, but there is some fun.\" Truth, he says, \"can be funny, hopeful and complicated\". The hope emerges from Todd's friendship with the girl Viola, sole survivor of some sort of plane crash, who becomes his travelling companion. \"Todd and Viola connect - not in a girl/boy way, but so as to survive. Viola is the first person Todd has ever trusted, and that's the way to make things happen.\"</p> <p>Though the novel unfolds as a gripping chase narrative, Ness cares very much about the ideas that power Todd's story, describing the narrative as a Trojan horse. \"If I could get the narrative right I could write the ideas.\" Which brings us back to that all-pervasive din, and the importance of privacy. The internet, he says, is \"a kind of unedited 'id'\" - not unlike \"the Noise\" that surrounds Todd. The question he asks in the story is, what would you do if you couldn't turn that noise off? How can you escape it without cutting yourself off completely from other people? Todd's connection with Viola reflects their creator's view that \"the greatest victory you can have is connecting with another person. If you can do it with one, you can do it with all.\"</p> <h2>Puppy talk</h2> <p>The first thing you find out when yer dog learns to talk is that dogs don't got nothing much to say. About anything.</p> <p>\"Need a poo, Todd.\"</p> <p>\"Shut up, Manchee.\"</p> <p>\"Poo. Poo, Todd.\"</p> <p>\"I said shut it.\"</p> <p>We're walking across the wild fields south-east of town, those ones that slope down to the river and head on towards the swamp. Ben's sent me to pick him some swamp apples and he's made me take Manchee with me, even tho we all know Cillian only bought him to stay on Mayor Prentiss's good side and so suddenly here's this brand new dog as a present for my birthday last year when I never said I wanted any dog, that what I said I wanted was for Cillian to finally fix the fissionbike so I wouldn't have to walk every forsaken place in this stupid town, but oh, no, happy birthday, Todd, here's a brand new puppy, Todd, and even tho you don't want him, even tho you never asked for him, guess who has to feed him and train him and wash him and take him for walks and listen to him jabber now he's got old enough for the talking germ to set his mouth moving?

  "<p>It feels appropriate that cosmology should form the underlying basis of Neal Stephenson's vertiginous new novel. Both hold, for me, a boundlessly engaging fascination that comes at the price of being made to feel infinitesimally small: not merely as a human being, but as a writer, too. The scale of his works since Cryptonomicon in 1999 has been such as to require a greater commitment than some marriages. Even with Snow Crash (1993), a breakneck satirical geek-fest that still reads as though it's years ahead of the cyber-curve, he was demonstrating an aptitude for wrangling big ideas without sacrificing pace or lightness of touch. That early novel has its faraway echoes in Anathem, as Stephenson again explores the relationships between language, thought and meaning: specifically, whether the last can exist outside of the direct dominions of the first two.</p> <p>Anathem takes place on a world called Arbre, where our narrator, Erasmas or \"Raz\", is an avout Decenarian fraa in the concent of Saunt Edhar. Don't panic: I will elaborate upon this last sentence. The concents are like monasteries, but where science, philosophy and mathematics are studied, rather than theology. The word concent suggests an encircling structure to these sanctuaries - metaphorical rather than necessarily physical - in which the fraas and suurs are denominated according to how often their constituent group opens its gates to the world beyond: from unarians (once a year) to the remotely cloistered millenarians.</p> <p>In these realms of the avout, the word saunt (a punning contraction of \"savant\") is defined as \"a term of veneration applied to great thinkers, almost always posthumously\". However, this does not imply that the people of Arbre revere academe above religion or even \"saecular\" ambition. When their gates are closed, these concents are sealed off almost entirely from the saecular world: they are not allowed direct access to technology (their limited use of it being moderated by an authentically grumpy caste of IT types), and write their proofs on genetically modified leaves, as even paper is not permitted. Their Discipline dictates not only that they receive no news from outside the concent, but also that the ten-, hundred- and thousand-year constituents have no inter-communication either. This is ostensibly so that their \"theoric\" study is uncontaminated by transitory ideas, but more historically it is because the saecular world mistrusts them with a suspicion that has spilled over into catastrophic violence at various points throughout the planet's history.</p> <p>The obvious early point of reference is Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast novels, as Stephenson immerses the reader in a world of ritual and order, the reasons for which are not entirely understood by their adherents. These are people who think as a vocation, deconstructing the reasoning behind every statement; yet even in such a culture, ritual can take hold and impose an order whole centuries after the reasons for it have been forgotten.</p> <p>Arbre's is a civilisation several thousand years more mature than our own; I say mature rather than advanced, as there is a deep sense of technological ages largely forgotten, buried under cataclysm. World wars and genocide are recorded as mere harbingers of \"the Terrible Events\". The hidden history of this world, and in particular the relationship between the avout and the saecular, emerges in glimpses only once a threat of unprecedented scale sees Raz and some of his fellow avout \"evoked\": that is, sent on a mission that will take them not merely into the saecular world, but to points far beyond.</p> <p>Stephenson insisted that his historical trilogy The Baroque Cycle be described as SF because it was \"fiction about science\". He tags Anathem as \"speculative fiction\", but in keeping with his previous work, this novel is as much about language, and it provides a whole new playground for his fascination with etymology. Take the term \"speelycaptor\", for example, which denotes any kind of visual recording device. It is a word that does not merely imply a plausible coinage, but suggests a history of usage that has transcended and even abandoned the technology that first gave rise to it. Laden with dozens of such words, Anathem is as much a code-breaking experience as Cryptonomicon, due to the teasing way Stephenson's neologisms gradually unlock themselves.</p> <p>However, the beating heart of this novel is philosophy, and if I may borrow an analogy from Professor Stephen Law, at times Anathem is not so much a work-out in the philosophy gym as philosophy extreme sports. The history of the avout is punctuated by the breakthrough ideas of saunts, all of them replicating concepts familiar to us here on Earth through Plato, Euclid, Leibniz, Newton and so on. Edmund Husserl's copper ashtray becomes Atamant's Bowl; Occam's razor becomes Saunt Gardan's Steelyard. This is more than mere facsimile: the most powerful and controversial idea among the avout concerns the \"Hylaean Theoric World\", and the question of whether the same ideas will occur independently to thinkers on different planets because there are certain transcendental truths - prime numbers, the value of pi, the laws of geometry - that exist on some higher plane. Taking his cue from the likes of Hugh Everett and Max Tegmark, Stephenson postulates that, while certain conditions are necessary for the cosmos to have taken shape (various laws of physics, such as the speed of light, having to be set at very precise values), there is still room for tiny variations in those values to create parallel cosmoses in which the make-up of matter is minutely distinct. It is the many worlds theory evoked with a greater elegance than I have read in any previous work of \"speculative fiction\". For that let us hail him Saunt Neal of Seattle.</p> <p>Weighing in at 800 head-stretching pages, Anathem demands a near-avout level of commitment, but rewards those who enter its concent with bounteous gifts of wisdom, beauty and \"upsight\". The only catch to reading a novel as imposingly magnificent as this is that for the next few months, everything else seems small and obvious by comparison. Indeed, Stephenson's own predicament in the midst of such a towering project is succinctly encapsulated in one character's fraught observation: \"Why did I study Linguistics instead of Celestial Mechanics? Linguistics got me into this excellent mess - only physics can get me out.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Christopher Brookmyre's latest novel is A Snowball in Hell (Little, Brown)</p>",
  "<p>Leading public schools are to launch a charm offensive on the state sector by declaring an end to the \"cold war\" between state-funded and fee-charging institutions. </p> <p>Tim Hastie-Smith, the chairman of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), which represents the 250 best-known public schools including Eton, Winchester and Harrow, told the Guardian it was essential to break down perceptions of a \"chav-snob divide\" to give all children a balanced education and experience in life.</p> <p>He will tell the HMC's annual conference in London next week that the government and opposition are convinced that the independent school model should be replicated in the state sector through privately controlled academies. Independent schools should encourage that by sharing their expertise, he believes. </p> <p>Speakers at the conference will include the Labour MP Frank Field and former education secretary Estelle Morris, both leading proponents of comprehensive schools. The schools minister, Lord Adonis, is due to give a speech on Tuesday unveiling plans to open up six leading independent schools' combined cadet forces to local state-school pupils.</p> <p>Sixteen local authorities have also signed up to send children in care to 70 boarding schools across the country. Only 15 children have so far been placed in schools but more are expected to follow next September. </p> <p>Hastie-Smith, who announced this month that next year he would leave his post as head of Dean Close school, in Cheltenham, to become head of a government-funded academy, said the moves marked an atmosphere of \"glasnost\" between the sectors, which have been suspicious of one another. </p> <p>He said: \"Independent schools' greatest strength is their independence, it's about being able to set the curriculum and use staff in the way you want. But it's also about the responsibility: the buck stops with you. The state sector can learn from that.\"</p> <p>Asked if it amounted to a thawing of a \"cold war\" between the sectors, he added: \"Yes I think it's glasnost. Nobody thinks the split between the state and independent sectors is a good thing.</p> <p>\"Anything we do to break down the perceptions of a chav-snob divide has got to be good.\"</p> <p>It marks a considerable change in mood among leading private schools. A year ago Adonis attempted to woo HMC heads into adopting academies by exempting them from the \u00a32m charged to private sponsors. </p> <p>Bernard Trafford, headmaster of Wolverhampton grammar school, who was then chairman of the HMC, responded by warning the government to keep its \"hands off\" private schools, claiming that academies, changes in private schools' registration and new rules on their charitable status were threatening their independence.</p> <p>Hastie-Smith said the mood had not been affected by the change in the law which would see private schools compelled to prove their worth as a charity. His comments are publicly supported by colleagues within the HMC. </p> <p>But one HMC source said: \"Heads are personally, professionally and philosophically in favour of doing this work. But they face barriers. Parents of their pupils who pay the fees want to know their investment is ring-fenced.</p> <p>\"Independent schools are already at full stretch and the next two to three years will be hard so they can't afford to haemorrhage their own resources and strengths on this.\"</p>",
  "<p>The US rapper Busta Rhymes last night won a high-court battle to play at a charity concert for thousands of young volunteers, as a judge denied government efforts to gain his deportation. </p> <p>The judgment came less than two hours before the gig at the Royal Albert Hall was to begin. Rhymes, who has already been allowed entry to the UK twice this year, has a valid work permit for the concert. </p> <p>Mr Justice Stadlen, at the high court in London, ruled that the singer, whose real name is Trevor Smith, could seek a judicial review challenging the legality of the decision to refuse him entry to the UK. </p> <p>Rhymes was detained for 11 hours on Thursday at London City airport by immigration officials who cited \"unresolved convictions\" in the US. But the court heard the decision to have him barred from the UK was based on incorrect information that he had a conviction for \"gang assault\".</p> <p>His counsel, Amanda Weston, argued that the basis on which he was refused entry was incorrect as the offences of assault and drink driving of which he had been convicted constituted \"misdemeanours\" under New York law, not \"felonies\".</p> <p>Ruling that an injunction stopping the 36-year-old's removal should stay in place, the judge said he was concerned that if the singer did not perform the 4,000 volunteers who had done charity work and earned a ticket to the Orange RockCorps concert would be disappointed, an outcome that could have an adverse effect on the charity scheme.</p>",
  "<p>The turmoil in the City and slowing economy have proved a boon for insolvency specialist Begbies Traynor, which yesterday said the number of companies forced into liquidation would grow strongly over the next couple of years.</p> <p>The company, which recently warned that nine UK airlines were near collapse, said several sectors had been badly hit by the UK's economic woes. In a statement to shareholders before its annual general meeting, it said revenues were significantly ahead of last year.</p> <p>Ric Traynor, executive chairman, said construction companies, property firms and printing businesses were the frontline casualties of the deteriorating economic climate, along with transport firms, retailers and leisure businesses such as pubs, clubs and smaller hotel chains.</p> <p>\"I'm afraid I think there is a lot of pain to be felt. It will be busier in 2009, and 2010 will be busy as well.</p> <p>\"Wherever businesses are affected by discretionary spending you see stress. Printing, for instance, is one of the first to be hit because companies, even though they are probably shooting themselves in the foot, cut their marketing spending,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Transport is a supplier to industry and commerce, which does not need so many goods to be delivered. The cost of diesel hit them hard and they tend to operate with little fat on them, so when the bad times come it is easy for them to tip over. Removals companies are particularly vulnerable.\"</p> <p>Begbies is one of the few insolvency firms to be listed on the London stock exchange. Larger rivals, including Kroll and the major accountancy firms, have largely remained partnerships. </p> <p>In recent weeks accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers has become administrator for high-profile crashed companies including Lehman Brothers and the holiday firm XL. </p> <p>Begbies generally advises on mid-market firms in trouble. In June the firm was apppointed joint administrator of the Luton-based business-class-only airline Silverjet, which became the first of several budget airlines to go bust. It was after the recent collapse of XL that Begbies predicted nine other operators faced the same fate.</p> <p>Traynor said in previous years he would expect to rescue a large proportion of firms in trouble and sell them to trade buyers, but \"in the current climate there is little appetite to buy distressed companies\".</p> <p>He said most were falling straight into administration and the majority were being wound up. </p> <p>Private equity firms, which traditionally seek out bargains among firms that have collapsed, were \"sitting on their hands\", and banks, which would normally lend to new owners, are refusing to extend loans as part of rescue operations, he said.</p> <p>The firm has boosted the number of fee-earning staff by seven to 55 since last year, when it suffered a decline in business and a sharp fall in its share price.</p>",
  "<h2>Shot fired at police during 80mph chase of stolen car</h2> <p>A shot was fired at a police car in Salford as it pursued a stolen vehicle at speeds of up to 80mph, it emerged yesterday. A 26-year-old male passenger was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after he fired a gun from the car window on Thursday night before fleeing into a house for a 90-minute standoff. Four suspects ran into an estate. The Skoda Octavia, which had been taken in an aggravated burglary in Worlsey a few days earlier, was abandoned after the pursuit. It is believed it was stolen by a gang who have taken about six cars in the Salford and Trafford areas to use as getaway vehicles.<br><strong>Helen Carter</strong></p> <h2>Woman, 82, is banished from home for five years</h2> <p>An 82-year-old woman was banned from her home for five years yesterday for breaching an antisocial behaviour order. A jury at Cardiff crown court found Dorothy Evans guilty of twice breaching the order by harassing her neighbours in Park Crescent, Abergavenny, south Wales. Evans, who denied all charges, was cleared of a further eight breaches. Judge Nicholas Cooke QC made the new asbo \"with regret\", banning her from a square mile area around the house where she has lived for 41 years. The judge said the only alternative to the order would be a lengthy prison sentence.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Planes left in wrong place force BA to cancel flights</h2> <p>British Airways cancelled more flights from Heathrow and Gatwick airports yesterday due to knock-on effects from a computer failure at Britain's main air traffic control centre. Around 20 short-haul flights to and from Edinburgh, Paris, Brussels, Dublin and Venice were scrapped after planes were left in the wrong locations overnight. A spokeswoman said BA would ask for a full investigation by Nats, the air traffic control group that operates the Swanwick air traffic control centre and is part-owned by BA. Around 12,000 passengers were affected by cancellations on Thursday.<br><strong>Dan Milmo</strong></p> <h2>Two held after London teenager dies in stabbing</h2> <p>A 19-year-old lost his life in a stabbing in west London yesterday. Craig Steven Marshall died in hospital from his wounds at 8am, after the knifing outside Rufford Tower on Lexden Road, Acton. Two men, both in their twenties, were arrested in connection with the attack and were being held at a west London police station. Marshall became the 27th teenager to die as a result of street violence in the capital this year. A postmortem examination will be held to establish the exact cause of death. The killing followed that of Oliver Kingonzila, 19, who was stabbed outside a bar on September 13.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p>",
  "<p>Speculation intensified last night that Bradford &amp; Bingley's days as an independent bank were numbered, after its shares were pummelled and its market value fell to \u00a3390m, a fall of more than 90% from its peak.</p> <p>Shares in Lloyds TSB, HBOS, and Royal Bank of Scotland also dived, amid heightened concern over stability in the financial system if plans for the $700m (\u00a3378bn) US mortgage market bail-out fail.</p> <p>The financial authorities were reportedly scrambling for a solution for Bradford and Bingley, amid worry that the stricken lender might have to be nationalised if no solution can be found.</p> <p>Speaking in Washington, Gordon Brown last night refused to comment on reports that the leading buy-to-let mortgage provider faced nationalisation. \"I wouldn't comment, and nobody would expect me to comment, on these speculative statements made in newspapers,\" he said after talks on the financial crisis with George Bush. \"I'm not going to comment on any individual company or building society.\"</p> <p>But Treasury officials were reportedly preparing contingency plans in case the situation further deteriorates and a buyer fails to materialise.

  "<p>Night fell over the village, though it made no difference to us, lying slumped against the walls of the nagmash (armoured personnel carrier). Ten of us were crammed into a space not much bigger than a double bed, flung back and forth every time we hit a boulder in the road. We shared the space with the remains of our lunch, as well as tomorrow's breakfast. The sweat pouring down our faces was black with dirt, and our shirts were stuck fast to our backs. Gabe looked like a melting snowman - if it weren't for his moaning quietly from time to time, I'd have thought he'd passed out in the back. </p> <p>Occasionally, I'd muster the energy to stand up and peer through the small panes of bulletproof glass at the top of the nagmash to try to get my bearings. The windows were far too thick to see anything clearly, but we'd already been through the centre of Tulkarm once and now seemed to be circling the deserted backstreets over and over. </p> <p>Having been stuck in this cauldron for 15 hours, I couldn't have cared less whether or not we caught the terrorists - I was all for calling it a draw, and arranging a replay in two weeks' time. </p> <p>Not so our platoon commander. He stood up at the front of the vehicle, urging Shai to drive ever onwards towards God knew what. He manned the machine gun mounted on the roof, swivelling it in the direction of any unfortunate who was sharing the cobbled roads with our mini-tank. Eventually we noticed that we were slowing down, and it sounded as though we were now driving off-road, which was usually a sign that we were looking for a place to park up and rest. </p> <p>Perking up momentarily, we debated whether this was a five-minute pit stop or the couple of hours' sleep we'd been promised. We piled out of the back door and surveyed our surroundings. We seemed to be in the back garden of a mansion-sized house on a residential backstreet, and the owner's family were peering at us from the porch with a mixture of bemusement and disgust. </p> <p>We took positions - everyone covering one another, guns locked and loaded, as we edged forward. The squad from the other nagmash were also here, approaching from the other side of the garden, and we were now 20 strong as we descended on the house that we were going to commandeer for the night. </p> <p>The platoon commander delivered curt instructions in Arabic to the family members sitting on chairs on the veranda. Taking Matan with him, he disappeared inside the house and set about locking the family in the basement, before letting the rest of us in to search the building. Once we'd declared it clear, we all gathered in the lounge to receive our orders. We were to guard in pairs, everyone doing 20-minute shifts over the next four hours while the others slept. We stripped off our shirts, rolled them up as pillows, and crashed out on the tiled floor of the living room. </p> <p>We were under strict orders not to touch anything in the house; not even to use the bathrooms. The place was a palace compared with some of the shacks we'd been used to searching - it turned out the houses we took over were always big, to avoid embarrassing poorer folk who would be ashamed of their meagre possessions. It still felt as if we were taking liberties, half-naked and sprawled all over the floor of this family's lounge. I could hardly argue; we could not drive all the way back to our side of the border every time we needed to sleep. And if we dossed down in the nagmash here on the West Bank, we'd be sitting targets for anyone with a rocket-propelled grenade who might fancy his chances. On the other hand, keeping the family locked in the basement smacked of human shields to me. I passed out and went to sleep anyway - the thought in my mind that there was no way we were winning the peace with this particular clan. </p> <p>It all began in the comfort of my London home as I watched the second intifada unfold on the TV news. I felt the piercing stare of an Israeli Lord Kitchener: my country needed me. With every bus that exploded in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, the feeling grew stronger - I should be playing my part. I had a religious affiliation to Israel, the land of my forefathers, and a more personal attachment to the modern-day Jewish state thanks to twice-yearly childhood holidays and a gap year spent travelling the country. </p> <p>So it was that in November 2004 I found myself in a barracks on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, struggling to pull on eight-holed combat boots and staring at my olive-clad reflection in the mirror. Within a matter of months, I would be on my first tour of duty in the heart of the West Bank. </p> <p>Our first placement after completing training was guarding Rachel's Tomb, a site of pilgrimage for Jews, situated on the edge of the al-Aida refugee camp in Bethlehem. At that time, the Bethlehem stretch of the security wall was unfinished, which meant extra troops were required to provide protection for the thousands of visitors who thronged daily to the site. We rode the bulletproof buses from the checkpoint to the tomb, as much to calm the nerves of the tourists as to provide any practical assistance. Rock-throwing youths dispersed long before we could dismount the buses and give chase, and the shatterproof glass in the windows was more than sufficient to repel the sporadic attacks. </p> <p>However, we were required to carry out regular patrols of the Muslim cemetery behind the tomb, as well as the narrow alleys of the refugee camp, where our presence did nothing to abate the tension that was palpable on every street corner. Decked out in full combat gear, with words of encouragement from the pilgrims ringing in our ears as we left the tomb, we would march towards al-Aida and straight into a scene from CNN. A teeming refugee camp, piles of rubble everywhere, Arab men lounging on half-built walls and us: six heavily armed Israeli soldiers. </p> <p>On one roasting hot summer's day, during a routine patrol, the inevitable happened - a group of youths, screaming \"Allahu Akhbar\", greeted us with a hail of stones, and we took cover behind a nearby building. The sergeant said that he and Shtricks would hide behind a wall while the other four of us walked in a snake-like formation in view of the youths. The aim was to draw another barrage of rocks, at which point the sergeant would arrest one or two of them. It was too easy - we walked, they threw, we retreated, the sergeant leapt out and slammed a boy against the wall, holding him by the neck. He was a sullen, scruffily dressed boy of maybe 14. The sergeant asked us if he'd been one of the stone throwers; I said yes, without being 100% sure - it hardly mattered, since the objective was to make a point to his friends. </p> <p>We marched him to our base. There was a dodgy moment when a group of men, maybe 25-year-olds, ran towards us, shouting; we trained our guns on them and made them back off. We delivered the boy to one of the squadron commanders. It was our first unplanned arrest (as opposed to arrests made on a raid), so everyone swarmed around the kid as if he was a rare butterfly we'd netted. He was made to sit in the sun against a wall and, cursing and shouting, he threw the cup of water he was offered all over the commander. </p> <p>The sergeant was strutting around, beaming gleefully - a bit overly proud, I thought, considering he'd nabbed a teenager, with five armed soldiers behind him as backup. After about 20 minutes, we marched the boy out to hand him over to his parents, who had been summoned to meet us. The father had to lift his shirt to prove he wasn't wearing a bomb belt before we allowed him anywhere near us. The boy went home and the patrol was over.</p> <p>The debriefing was interesting; we sat in the same positions in the sergeant's room as we had before. Only an hour had passed, but we were older and wiser - we dissected the experience as if it were simply another part of training, and not as though we'd been in a very real, very dangerous situation that nearly became a riot. </p> <p>Was this really the best way to keep the peace and ease tension, I asked the sergeant. He maintained that the boy would learn his lesson and it was all for the best; I said that was wishful thinking - the boy was plainly now a hero among his friends. Did he expect us to take pride in what we'd done? </p> <p>Once the debriefing was over, we discussed the incident among ourselves. Why did our merely being on patrol - not beating someone or damaging property - cause such a violent reaction? Why did young kids, who had been playing with kites and footballs until we arrived on patrol, suddenly become mini-terrorists? It was clear that several of us weren't comfortable with our seemingly over-the-top reaction to the stone-throwing. If the David and Goliath overtones of the situation were clear to us, how much more so would they be to those on the other side of the divide?</p> <p>As the weeks wore on, and we spent more and more time dealing with the locals through the sights of our guns, it became increasingly apparent that we were never going to win over hearts and minds - not when we were barking, \"Stop or I'll shoot\" at women approaching us on the checkpoint. Wasn't there a way to engage with Palestinians that wouldn't compromise our security? </p> <p>Another patrol on Route 60 made it very clear that our commanders were interested only in the here and now. We were going through the usual stop and search of random pedestrians and vehicles when an incident just as we were leaving turned nasty. Six of us stopped a man and his son in their BMW; we ordered the father out at gunpoint while the five-year-old child silently watched. The platoon commander dealt with him very curtly, making him stand, sit and so on, at whim. This went on for about 25 minutes, with passersby watching, until the squadron vice commander rocked up in his Jeep and treated the detainee, a family man of about 35, even more brusquely. The suspect was becoming visibly upset. Once the commanders finally got bored with tormenting him, we headed back, stopping to force another man and his six-year-old son to lift their shirts on the way. </p> <p>During the debriefing, it all came out as we took on the platoon commander for his fierce handling of the situation. Several soldiers were upset at an event earlier in the week, where they'd been made to surround a house at 1am and wake all the residents, a large family, and order them out into the cold, simply for a practice exercise. All this led to some heated debate. I asked the platoon commander if he would have been happy if his own dad had been treated in the way he'd dealt with the man in the BMW. As usual, he batted away all criticism with a flat statement that everything we did was \"for security reasons\", plain and simple. </p> <p>The discontent in my unit grew with every unsavoury incident that we witnessed or in which we were forced to take part. My friend Shai, who was assigned to accompany two prisoners en route to Shin Bet interrogators, told me that the interrogators ordered the soldiers to finish their meals and put the remains from the plates into a sandwich for the Palestinians. Shai refused - \"Are we Nazis?\" - and gave them half his meal. He also told me that when the Palestinians offered some of the food back to the soldiers, the Shin Bet men tossed it out the window, saying, \"Don't eat food after an Arab's touched it.\" </p> <p>Our next posting was in the nearby village of Bet Jalla, where our base was a disused hotel on the edge of town. One morning, out on patrol, we got a call from the \"eye in the sky\" camera crew, who directed us to drive to a local school where students were apparently hurling rocks at Jewish cars. That was music to the ears of our Yemenite commander, Shoko, who morphed into A-Team mode all of a sudden, ramming a magazine into his gun and checking his grenades were in his vest. A bit strong, I thought, seeing as we were going to be at least 10 years older than our opponents. </p> <p>We flew along the Bet Jalla backstreets, nearly upending a donkey and cart when we tore around one blind corner. We drove with the back doors of the Jeep open, and Arthur and I kept our guns trained on anyone who stared at us for too long. Arthur turned to me as we sped along: \"You know, I'm much less scared of being around Palestinians than I used to be.\" No shit, mate - you're in a bulletproof Jeep with three other soldiers and enough firepower to turn the whole town into Swiss cheese. </p> <p>As we approached the school, we parked hurriedly on the grass and split into pairs. Arthur stayed with the driver in the Jeep, so I was Shoko's zug (partner), which meant that wherever he went, I trailed in his wake, Marlboro-coated lungs protesting at the pace at which I was running. As we rounded the final corner, we were confronted with 15 10-year-olds holding rocks bigger than their heads, which they tossed off the side of the hill into the path of the cars below. Even more disturbing was the sight of their 50-year-old teacher standing to one side, supervising them as he puffed languidly on a cigarette. When Shoko shouted at him in Arabic, asking what the kids were doing, he shrugged and replied, \"It's their break time.\" </p> <p>After Shoko warned him he would bring the children to order himself if necessary, the teacher ever so slowly turned towards his charges and told them to go inside. We piled back into the Jeep, depressed - the other three because there had been no action, me because we hadn't had time for a cigarette break. I turned on my iPod and ignored Shoko's debriefing. There were plenty of political and emotional issues to discuss after seeing a class of infants throwing missiles with their teacher looking on, but the present company wasn't the ideal forum. Dror, the (reservist) driver, was more concerned with phoning his broker to check on his trades than listening to the two-way radio. Shoko looked genuinely sad that he wouldn't be adding to his kill-count today, and Arthur's idea of philosophical discourse was dissecting Tupac's lyrics as though analysing Baudelaire. </p> <p>The next day I was again on Shoko's squad, and once more the women monitoring the cameras put out a call for us to head to the school. I was starting to feel like an Ofsted inspector. The brief this time was that a boy wanted for a recent Molotov attack had been spotted in the playground, and we needed to bring him in for questioning. Our team played with the same formation as the day before: Shoko and me up front (to make the arrest), Arthur and the driver shoring up the defence (or, more accurately, gorging themselves on the remains of breakfast in the back of the Jeep). </p> <p>This time I was much more aware of the danger. Every corner we rounded, we did so guns first, since we had no idea who was lying in wait or where we were going. It was eerily quiet as we went round the perimeter of the school; I could just about make out the dull tones of classroom chanting from an upstairs window, but otherwise the only sound was our guns smashing against our bulletproof vests as we ran. We finally found the playground where a football match was taking place. Twenty kids in their mid-teens were hurtling around the concrete pitch in hot pursuit of a worn-out leather ball. </p> <p>As we edged up to the fence, one or two of the players noticed us, but barely looked twice. Finally, Shoko got word over the radio of which kid we wanted and, after shouting at the children in Arabic, he marched determinedly into their midst and grabbed his quarry. The other students literally turned their backs on the scene without a word, continuing their match, unperturbed that one team was now a player down. Was it really such an everyday occurrence for them that it didn't bother them in the slightest? I tried to imagine what would have happened if a couple of marines had arrested one of my classmates. Then again, I couldn't imagine our headmistress allowing us to throw rocks at passing cars either. </p> <p>As Shoko manhandled the boy towards the Jeep, one of the boy's teachers struggled to catch up with us, shouting something indecipherable in Arabic. (Actually, everything in Arabic was indecipherable to me. All I could say was \"Stop or I'll shoot\", \"Give me your ID\" and \"Lift up your shirt\" - the sum total of the army's language training.) She pleaded with Shoko, who didn't like being interrupted in the middle of his \"mission\". Eventually the camera crew told us to let the boy go since he was too young to hold overnight and it would have been more trouble than it was worth to have to return him to the village at sundown. </p> <p>As we walked back to the jeep, Shoko turned to me and said, \"Did you see that? I swear, the little fucker was about to start crying.\"</p> <p>\"Yeah, Shoko - he's barely 13 and staring down the barrels of two semi-automatics,\" I said, surprised at the look on my commander's face. Perhaps, growing up a dark-skinned Yemenite surrounded by Ashkenazis (European Jews), he'd had rough times - now he was getting his moment in the sun.</p> <p>It was raiding the house near Tulkarm that was the last straw for me; looking into the eyes of the children as we screamed at their father and wrested from him command of his own house. That was when it dawned on me what the effect of our actions would be - the next generation were guaranteed to end up hating us when all they saw was us herding them like cattle. </p> <p>There was another episode, too, a few days later, when our unit was called upon to bolster the forces massed in Homesh, a West Bank settlement scheduled for evacuation during the disengagement. Despite the threats of the settlers that they would fight tooth and nail to defend their homes, our commanders decided that we would ignore their words, down tools, and deal with them without our weapons to protect us. This was, they said, to douse the tension between the two camps; it was a far cry from the way we dealt with Palestinians who made similar threats. I tackled the platoon commander: if this softly-softly approach was the best for one group of \"enemies\", why would it not be similarly effective in calming hostilities with the local Palestinians? </p> <p>The Palestinians, he said, were a different kettle of fish entirely, for whom kid-glove treatment would be out of the question. In the event, the settlers attacked and wounded dozens of soldiers, but the incidents were brushed under the carpet by the authorities, who were keen to paint them as \"peaceful protesters\", in contrast with their ever-violent, ever-aggressive Palestinian counterparts. </p> <p>The more I banged my anti-occupation drum, the more I was confronted with the accusation that \"you don't know what you're talking about - you haven't been in the country long enough to realise how much they hate us\". But I believed 15 months in a combat unit more than qualified me to counter that claim.</p> <p>In order to be taken seriously in this country, you have to jump through hoops to prove you know what you are talking about, and also show that you are prepared to do your bit for the society in which you live. But doing your bit for society didn't have to mean donning combat boots and marauding the West Bank, making Palestinians' lives a misery - this was a view shared by ever-increasing numbers of ex-combat soldiers in Israel. A study by Haifa University concluded that \"over the course of their military service, combat soldiers become less rightwing, adopt more dove-ish political views and are more open to compromise on security matters\". </p> <p>It was easy for the armchair warriors to urge Israel on to ever more combative lengths. Experiencing first-hand the unpleasantness of occupation - and carrying out the orders - opened our eyes to the truth of what was happening more than a lifetime of blindly cheering on the IDF from the sidelines ever could.</p>",
  "<p>Until last week I'd never set foot in a snowdome. That obviously didn't stop me rubbishing them at every opportunity. Why ride crappy fake snow on a run the size of a driveway, when you could put your cash towards a trip to real mountains? But when two friends morphed from fellow snowdome-haters to evangelical converts - one a skier who learnt to snowboard there, the other a snowboarder who suddenly became good at tricks - I decided to give it, and my freestyle skills, a chance. </p> <p>Considering I've been snowboarding for eight years, two of which were spent in Chamonix riding steep slopes and deep powder, I shouldn't be so comically inept at freestyle. Yet I ride through the centre of half-pipes and avoid rails like the plague, and the only time I get any air is by accident. This is partly because I'm chicken, but also because I'm scared of looking stupid in front of kids half my age but 100 times better in a snow park. So the decision to head to the SNO!zone at Xscape in Milton Keynes for one of the twice-weekly freestyle nights went against all my natural instincts. I feared it would be full of teenage boys with moody stares, hurling themselves off giant kickers.</p> <p>But I was pleasantly surprised to find a wide mix of ages and abilities, and just as many women as men. </p> <p>Jules Chappell, a freestyle coach who was tasked with making me less useless at tricks, told me the regular participants range in age from six to 69. She recently started the Girls Snow Academy, which takes place on the last Thursday of every month, and already has 50 regulars, from beginners to advanced sponsored riders. </p> <p>It was authentically cold inside the ski area, which was nice and wide, but not especially steep or long. But then what did I expect, an indoor Trois Vall\u00e9es? Most importantly, the snow felt great, far better than the fake stuff spurted out by snow cannons at ski resorts, and it was amazing to be carving turns when I'd been sitting behind a desk only two hours before. </p> <p>The rookie park consisted of a baby kicker, a bright yellow gas pipe set into the snow, and a scary-looking metal rainbow rail. The more serious park in the centre of the slope had bigger kickers, table-top jumps and big kinked rails. We spent some time on the baby kicker, where everyone was strangely friendly and supportive. The landing was nice and soft, and with Jules's helpful coaching and my growing confidence I was getting a respectable amount of air, and even managed an indy grab, which is the easiest kind, but a grab nonetheless. Confidence soon turned to cockiness and I tried some spins. The first one I tried to ride fakie (with my wrong foot forward) but my steering was so bad I completely missed the jump, and the second involved a rotation of sorts, though I stopped dead and ruined the landing area for everyone else. </p> <p>Jules suggested we moved to the gas pipe, which had a ramp so I didn't have to ollie (jump) on to it. \"If you can ride straight you can do this,\" she said. She held my arm on the first couple of goes, but I kept veering off halfway. Then finally I got it and rode right the way along the pipe. It felt amazing, and so much easier than I had expected. I can see how these freestyle nights are addictive. Sometimes they have huge airbags so you can go big on jumps and be guaranteed a soft landing. </p> <p>If you're used to hooning down mountains and have no interest in the park, this probably isn't the place for you. But if you're a beginner or a little rusty before a ski trip, or if you want to find some freestyle skills or hone what's already there, the SNO!zone makes a brilliant pre-season night out. Even though I'm still pretty rubbish at tricks, I improved dramatically in just two hours, and going snowboarding is always better than not going snowboarding, so in this cursed part of the world with no mountains of its own, this place is worth a visit.</p> <p>\u2022 Freestyle nights take place Thursdays and Fridays at SNO!zone (<a href=\"http://www.snozoneuk.com\">snozoneuk.com</a>) at Xscape in Milton Keynes, Braehead and Castleford.

  "<p>When developers - especially those hawking new apartment buildings with names like Olive or Aubergine - started branding this once-gritty area as SoMa, some locals rolled their eyes. They hadn't carved a bohemian niche in this mostly forgotten neighbourhood for it to be hijacked by yuppie-luring marketing campaigns. Luckily, South Main (as real locals refer to it) has mostly survived the spin, becoming Vancouver's coolest hangout and an ideal destination for visitors aiming beyond the city's crowded tourist attractions and its nature-hugging, camera-ready vistas.</p> <p>South Main - part of the historically working-class Mount Pleasant district - is best divided into two. The few blocks south of the traffic-choked Main Street and Broadway intersection comprise the showier end, complete with the kind of hangouts where sipping your espresso behind a top-end Apple laptop is de rigueur. Venture a few blocks past the paint-peeled dry cleaners and humdrum family restaurants to the intersection with 20th Avenue and you'll suddenly hit another pocket of cool. This stretch is studded with eclectic indie stores, serving the bright young things who colonise the wooden heritage homes lining the side streets.</p> <p>Make sure you visit both areas: the first has some of the city's best bars, restaurants and cafes; the second is where you'll pick up creative crafts and clothing and meet the artsy locals who make them. But do it soon. Vancouver is bristling with rampant development - even the dodgy downtown Eastside is sprouting apartment towers - so it's only a matter of time before South Main is subsumed by posing architects wearing their weekend Puma trainers and recalling the bad old days when there were only five branches of Urban Outfitters here.</p> <h2>1 Red Cat Records</h2> <p>Dive into Vancouver's indie music scene at this compact record store run by two members of local alt-country-rock band the Buttless Chaps. Singer Dave Gowans and guitarist Lasse Lutick are usually on hand to offer tips about must-see Vancouver acts such as Destroyer, Black Mountain and Fond of Tigers and you can listen to their recommendations at the in-store turntables and MP3 players.

Expect to see Dostoyevsky-reading singletons and young parents whose toddlers already dress better than you.

  "<p><strong>Gekko's back</strong> <br>Stockmarkets continued their rollercoaster ride, with many of Britain's banks again taking a caning. Where's it all going to end? As a little light relief, here's a bit of trivia, relayed to the Reporter by a banking contact: \"Interesting ironic fact. The last big crash in 1987 happened while the movie Wall Street was in production. The sequel Money Never Sleeps is now in production.\" Michael Douglas is set to reprise his role as corporate raider Gordon \"greed is good\" Gekko, and the film, expected next year, will reportedly be set partly in London. Presumably, the script is being rewritten on a daily basis to take account of all that's going on. Perhaps they'll have Gekko banged up for illegal short selling, or down on his luck, flogging the Big Issue ...</p> <p><strong>Harsh lesson</strong> <br>They're glass-half-full types at financial education charity the ifs School of Finance. It reckons youngsters could \"benefit\" from the financial meltdown because it is \"a real learning opportunity\". It adds: \"Business and finance is making the front pages of most newspapers as well as leading the broadcast media. This, in itself, makes learning about saving and investing more relevant to many young people.\" That's one way of looking at it. If these youngsters do own stockmarket-linked investments, they'll have learned one thing - they are worth less than they were at the start of this year.</p> <p><strong>Coining it </strong><br>Check the change in your pocket. The number of fake \u00a31 coins in circulation has doubled in the past five years, according to a BBC News report, with one in 50 now counterfeit. Indistinct lettering on the coin's edge will often be the giveaway. The Royal Mint says anyone who finds a fake pound coin in their wallet or purse should hand it to the police. Yeah, right. I'm sure they'll appreciate being asked to put their normal crime-fighting duties on hold while they investigate the provenance of Mrs Miggins's small change. Some of us would probably opt to pass the buck by sandwiching the offending item between two genuine coins, handing it over as payment in a shop, and walking away in a hurry. But that would be breaking the law - the Mint says it is \"a criminal offence\" to use a counterfeit coin.</p> <p><strong>Bringing home the bacon </strong><br>Talking of crime, if you're burgled, best to check the fridge as well as your jewellery boxes. A report in the freebie Metro newspaper revealed that police reckon junkies are stealing bacon for resale to finance their drug habits. Apparently, one store in Burnley has taken all the bacon out of its fridges after its entire stock was stolen two days running.</p> <p><strong>Equitable protest </strong><br>Last week it emerged that Gordon Brown had a policy with a company linked to scandal-hit Equitable Life (we don't know if he's still got it). This week, as the prime minister prepared to deliver his keynote speech at the Labour party conference in Manchester, angry Equitable policyholders staged a demo outside to highlight their demands for government compensation. The group, which carried a wooden coffin and wore black T-shirts saying \"30,000 dead waiting for justice\", want ministers to act on the parliamentary ombudsman's recommendation that they be paid redress. They said the coffin, which bore the words: \"It wasn't an Equitable Life after all, Henry\", represented the 15 Equitable Life pensioners who are dying every day. The government has said it will respond to the ombudsman in the autumn.</p> <p><strong>More dough for Stelios </strong><br>When the going gets tough, the tough ... start cooking pizzas? As we all know, these are tough times for the travel sector, but cut-price restaurants and takeaways are booming as Brits search out cheaper pleasures. Perhaps that's why Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the man who founded easyJet (and still owns a big slice) is expanding his <a href=\"http://www.easyPizza.com\">easyPizza.com</a> venture. Distinctive orange flyers stating easyPizza is \"now in your area\" have been dropping on to doormats in London and further afield. But these pizzas aren't for wimps; they only come in one size (large) and you can forget your goat's cheese and fresh rocket - Stelios is clearly a big fan of chili and pepperoni.</p>",
  "<p>Celtic Crusaders will bid farewell to a remarkable three-year National League odyssey when they face Salford in the NL1 Grand Final tomorrow. The Welsh club's rise to prominence will see them take up a three-year licence in Super League next season, and a group of Australian trail blazers have witnessed every step of their development.</p> <p>Jace van Dijk, Tony Duggan and Damien Quinn were three Queenslanders looking for a new challenge when the coach John Dixon approached them about a bold new venture on the other side of the world in 2005. Three years later the trio have provided the spine of a side that first earned promotion from NL2 before reaching tomorrow's NL1 showpiece game at Warrington's Halliwell Jones Stadium. Dixon has already stated that he will keep faith with the men who have served the club so well over the past three years. That means Van Dijk and company will complete a journey that began on a lonely field for a Northern Rail Cup game at Hemel Hempstead and will culminate in famous rugby league venues such as Headingley and Knowsley Road next year.</p> <p>\"I remember that match at Hemel, and thinking what a small field this was and how it wasn't like the grounds I was used to playing on,\" said Van Dijk, a tall, powerful scrum-half who has impressed a host of observers over the past three years. \"Tony Duggan scored the first try for the club, and we've come a long way since then. There was probably 50 people there that day.</p> <p>\"When we came over here, in the first training session we were teaching guys how to play the ball, because a few of them were from a rugby union background. Now when we go round the local schools, a lot of the people of Wales have taken the fundamental skills of rugby league on board. I can't say how far the club has come in three years, it's been phenomenal.\"</p> <p>The three players followed Dixon to Wales after playing under him in the Brisbane Broncos junior system in Queensland, and quickly made an impact over here. Van Dijk was named the NL2 player of the year in 2006, the full-back Duggan in the promotion-winning campaign the year after, and the stand-off Quinn completed the treble by landing this season's NL1 accolade last Tuesday.</p> <p>Quinn was rewarded for filling the playmaking hole left by Van Dijk's 11-week absence, after the scrum-half suffered a double broken jaw midway through the season against Batley. The 27-year-old was forced to eat through a straw for three weeks and lost nine kilograms in the same period. \"The only good thing was that it's probably freshened me up for the end of the season,\" Van Dijk said. \"But it wasn't a very nice injury. I've had a shoulder reconstruction but I'd take that over a broken jaw any time.\"</p> <p>The Crusaders laid down a marker for today's match with a crushing 44-18 win at Salford just two weeks ago, though Van Dijk insists that will have little bearing on tomorrow's outcome. At least both sides will be able to play without the pressure of the winner-take-all scenario of recent seasons, when the Grand Final victors were the only club granted promotion to the top flight. </p> <p>The new licence system ensures that Van Dijk, Duggan and Quinn are guaranteed to get their chance on the big stage regardless of tomorrow's result, after playing their full part in the Celtic success story.</p>",
  "<p>Tim Cahill has moved out of Liverpool and taken up yoga to handle the pressures of his football-obsessed environment this year, but he accepts that there is no escape from the magnitude of the 208th Merseyside derby. Nor does the Australian international seek one.</p> <p>Everton's season could flourish or flat-line in the coming week, with Liverpool's visit to Goodison Park followed by Thursday's ominous second date at Standard Li\u00e8ge in the Uefa Cup first round. Defeat at Blackburn Rovers in the Carling Cup prompted Joleon Lescott to issue a public apology to the supporters who booed off David Moyes' team at Ewood Park and the manager's fears about assembling a team so late in the transfer window are being realised with every meagre display.</p> <p>With seven games gone and 14 goals conceded, Everton still await their first clean sheet of a faltering campaign. No way to be facing unbeaten local rivals or no better opportunity to dispel the despondency Cahill, a supreme optimist with or without breath control, has no doubt.</p> <p>\"Beating Liverpool would be the ideal lift and that is the only way we can look at it. That's the beauty of this game,\" said Cahill, who has scored twice since his premature return from injury to re-emphasise his value to Everton. \"The seriousness of this game goes beyond football, it goes into people's livelihoods. I lived in Liverpool for four years so I understand what it's like to walk down the street to get a carton of milk after a derby. I get loads of banter, especially from the Liverpool fans, but it's a compliment when you get a bit of bitterness because it shows you're a threat and I've had a habit of scoring against Liverpool a few times. It's all about passion.\"</p> <p>The 28-year-old understands the criticism at Ewood but insists it is a question of when, not if, last season's fifth-placed side gel with new signings such as the \u00a315m Marouane Fellaini. It is the constant search for answers in a divided football city, however, that led to Cahill moving his young family to leafier climes earlier this year.</p> <p>He admits: \"One of the best things I did was to move away from football and just to concentrate on my family and my kids. My problem was I was too enthused in it all. I slept, ate and breathed football and there was no outlet. Liverpool's a beautiful city with beautiful people but I needed to be able to switch off and go down the park with my kids without having to listen to an adverse comment. I still always go out for dinner in Liverpool and see the lads here, but I needed a release from football. I can relax now without worrying about people saying I'm crap.\"</p> <p>Cahill's relocation was out of choice, but it was necessary for the Everton midfielder to change his training routine, relaxation techniques and even his running style having fractured the same metatarsal three times in 12 months. The Australian underwent revolutionary surgery in Sydney in April, after visiting specialists in London, Manchester and the Netherlands, but credits working with Danny Donnachie, Everton's well-being and performance coach, and son of the former Scotland international Willie, for ensuring no psychological scars survived the repeat injury.</p> <p>\"I've changed the way I run, my footwear, the insoles, all sorts, and I've been doing yoga and Pilates of an evening, anything to help,\" adds Cahill. \"People might think that's a bit radical but you have to switch off outside of football. We have a regime at Everton now where Danny works with us individually on matters on and off the pitch. A big part of football nowadays is the mental aspect. It is not all about technique. It's about how we overcome losing to Blackburn in the cup or drawing with Hull, and we know if we beat Liverpool all that will be forgotten.\"</p> <p>One constant in Cahill's repertoire is his goal celebration of trading punches with the corner flag, an idea that originated with an international team-mate Archie Thompson and, thanks to Cahill becoming the first Australian to score at a World Cup finals, is now replicated throughout their homeland. \"We both had baby boys around the same time and it is a celebration for our kids,\" Cahill explains. \"We based it on the Nintendo Wii. Archie had a kung-fu celebration and I just spiced it up a little bit. It would be nice to do it more than once against Liverpool.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Tuesday October 7 2008</strong><br> The Orchard is a medium secure hospital unit for women with mental disorders who pose a significant risk to themselves and or others. It is not specifically for women transferring from Broadmoor high security hospital, as we said. Women there are patients, not inmates. The latter has been corrected.</p> <p> </p> <p>Everyone in court agreed that Joanne Hill had suffered from serious mental health problems for almost half her life, even the prosecution, who argued that she had known exactly what she was doing when she drowned four-year-old Naomi in the bath last year. </p> <p>The lawyers conceded Hill had previously suffered significant psychiatric episodes, and struggled to cope with her daughter's cerebral palsy, for which she held herself personally responsible.</p> <p>At one point during the two-week trial the forensic psychiatrist called by the Crown as an expert witness - who testified that Hill's actions did not suggest a mental disorder at the time of the killing - admitted that she \"certainly\" seemed to be mentally ill in court, as she sat in the dock flanked by two nurses and a guard. </p> <p>Every day of the hearing, in fact, she was brought to Chester crown court not from a cell in the local prison but from the Ty Llewellyn medium-secure hospital unit near Bangor, north Wales. </p> <p>And yet on Tuesday the jury decided that Hill, who had been known to local mental health services in Connah's Quay, Flintshire, since she was 17 and had seen a child psychiatrist, had been in control of herself when she killed Naomi by holding her head under the water of a bubble-filled bath for up to 10 minutes last November. They decided the 32-year-old was not sufficiently mentally ill when she took her daughter's lifeless body from the bath, dried her off, dressed her in dungarees and lay her on the back seat of the car, then drove aimlessly for eight hours, stopping to buy wine and petrol before eventually taking her to the local hospital, long after anything could be done to save her.</p> <p>Simon Hill, her husband, had testified in court, saying Joanne had had \"very dark thoughts\". He said she once suggested Naomi should be adopted and thought it was her fault the child had cerebral palsy. Joanne veered between having a good, \"overpowering\" relationship with Naomi, when she would buy her a lot of toys, and being \"not so good\" with her, he said. After the trial, he said that what his wife did to their daughter was \"evil\".</p> <p>Hill's barrister, Stephen Riordan QC, said his client had an \"abnormal, tortured mind\". The jury did not agree. Unconvinced that Naomi's death was the consequence of Hill's illness, they rejected her defence of diminished responsibility and found her guilty of murder. </p> <p>Elgan Edwards, the Recorder of Chester, jailed her for life and ordered that she was not to be released for 15 years. He described the situation as a tragedy for all concerned. He told her: \"This has been a very sad case. Sad for you, your family, for your husband and his family, and tragic for the daughter you killed.\"</p> <p>During the two-week trial the jury heard that Hill was ashamed of Naomi's condition; the little girl had to use callipers to help her walk.</p> <p>It is a case which has stirred many emotions. In the Daily Mail Rosa Monckton, whose 13-year-old daughter has Down's syndrome, wrote: \"It was unquestionably an evil act and she deserved to be punished but I cannot help feeling sympathy for her.\" Mary Dejevsky, writing in the Independent, said: \"Society's expectations of women, inadequate care services, and an adversarial court system that magnifies vice and virtue could, and should, have been in the dock, too.\"</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian yesterday, a leading psychiatrist who examined Hill for three hours in August said that she had had complex psychological problems that defied easy categorisation.</p> <p>Aideen O'Halloran, clinical director of the Orchard, a secure unit for women patients from Broadmoor hospital, had told the court, as a witness for the defence, that Hill was \"suffering an abnormality of mind\" when she killed Naomi. Yesterday she said that Hill's mental disorder meant she had not been \"able or willing to open up about the extent of her difficulties\". </p> <p>That might be why Hill did not seek the help she needed. The disability charity Scope, which helps people with cerebral palsy, told the Guardian it had no record of Hill contacting it for support.</p> <p>\"Joanne Hill was quite a closed person, who appeared to struggle to access her emotions and consequently may not have made professionals aware of her needs,\" said the psychiatrist, who had told the court that Hill was in a \"trance-like state\" for much of their time together.</p> <p>O'Halloran said the case revealed \"the difficulties of trying to present an individual patient, with a serious level of mental disorder, to the courts, who does not fit neatly into a diagnostic category\".</p> <p>She added: \"This case highlights the weaknesses of relying on categorical diagnostic systems, which require individuals to fit neatly into category or risk not having the disorder recognised by the court. It highlights the mismatch between the clinical context and judicial context.</p> <p>\"It is difficult to get across complex psychiatric/psychological problems in an adversarial arena, where complex shades of grey do not fit neatly with the black/white answers required.\"</p> <p>Hill's legal team criticised much of the media coverage of the trial, which concentrated not on her mental health but on her \"shame\" over her daughter. Liam Ferris, her solicitor, said: \"What was very disappointing to many of those who know the case well was the way in which parts of the media chose almost to ignore the complex and important psychiatric issues involved. This can only have left the public misinformed about its real nature.\"</p> <p>Hill first showed signs of mental illness in the 1990s, when she was 17 and saw a child psychiatrist for anxiety. In 2000 she twice attempted suicide and throughout the year was prescribed drugs for anxiety, depression and sleeplessness. In January 2003, shortly before Naomi was born, Hill was diagnosed with chronic anxiety and in April had a \"hypermanic\" episode. </p> <p>Naomi was born 10 weeks premature in a \"difficult\" birth in June. Almost immediately Hill suffered puerperal depression, a severe form of postnatal depression. She was treated by her local community health team; appearing to make a quick recovery, she was recommended for discharge from outpatient care in September. On Boxing Day 2006 she had a severe relapse and left the family home to be cared for by her parents. But she recovered and went back to work part-time in March and then full-time a month later. In June doctors decided there was no need for further involvement by the local mental health team and in August her case was closed, although she remained under the care of her GP and on several types of medication. </p> <p>In November it was recorded that she was drinking heavily, increasing the risk of depression and the likelihood that she would stop taking her medicine. Later that month she killed Naomi.</p> <p>After the child's death North Wales NHS trust conducted an interim review looking at the care she had, and recommended improvements to policies. A spokesman said yesterday these had been implemented. A full review is being completed under the control of Flintshire local safeguarding children board.</p> <p>Alice Maynard, chair of Scope, said: \"This case raises the wider issue of how many disabled parents still don't get the support they need in bringing up children and how society continues to portray disability in a negative light, creating shame and stigma around impairment. Tragically, in this instance, this combination of factors proved lethal.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the middle of the revolutionary ferment of 1968, Raoul Vaneigem sent out a call to arms to the strap-hanging masses who were \"dragged out of sleep at six every morning, jolted about in suburban trains\" and \"tossed out at the end of the day into the entrance halls of railway stations, those cathedrals of departure for the hell of weekdays\". Situationist thinkers like Vaneigem believed that commuting was simply unpaid labour. Their utopian dream was to do away with the daily grind - what Parisians call \"m\u00e9tro-boulot-dodo\" (commute-work-sleep) - for good. </p> <p>Forty years on, this call to arms is still falling on deaf ears. Our heaving railway carriages are not hotbeds of activism; today's commuters seem actively to embrace their fate. Remember all those millennial stories about downshifters escaping from the office via their modems? According to a National Travel Survey, the number of people who work from home - 3% - has not changed since 2002. And in his new book, Traffic, Tom Vanderbilt cites numerous surveys which suggest that most people desire a minimum commute, a brief hiatus between home and work, of 20 minutes. Vanderbilt found that all over the world, from African villages to American cities, the round-trip from work to home and back again reached a natural equilibrium of about 1.1 hours.</p> <p>Yet our stock images of commuting are almost universally unflattering - from WH Auden's bowler-hatted gent (\"The eight o'clock train, the customary place, / Holding the paper in front of your face\") to Blur's Ernold Same, whose dull life is fittingly narrated by that well-known tube-rider, Ken Livingstone. </p> <p>I wonder if the survival of these negative images owes something to an idea of modernity we inherited from the 68-ers - the notion that we live in an unemotional, alienating public sphere which suppresses our intimate, authentic selves. In the years since then, and partly as a legacy of the \u00e9v\u00e9nements, the opposite has become the case. We now live in an intensely emotional public culture. The academic Eva Illouz invented the phrase \"cold intimacies\" to describe this culture in which emotional literacy is prized, pop psychology defines our identities, and our workplaces stress the importance of empathy and consensus. </p> <p>We live in a world, Illouz writes, that is \"Rousseauian with a vengeance\", in which our \"emotions have become entities to be evaluated, inspected, discussed, bargained, quantified, and commodified\". Perhaps, then, we have learnt to welcome the commute as a neutral space where we can escape this obligation to be permanently available to others, and where an informal public life can flourish, without the emotional demands of work or home. </p> <p>The French philosopher Michel de Certeau once wrote that a railway journey was an \"incarceration-vacation\" in which commuters could replace \"the compromises, opacities and dependencies of a workplace\" with \"the beautiful abstraction of the prison\". OK, De Certeau probably didn't travel much on First Great Western trains, but I still think he was on to something. Whenever I am in London, I am struck by the nonchalant virtuosity with which natives use the tube, the balletic economy of their movements - the way they flash their Oyster cards and walk straight through the barriers without breaking their stride, or know exactly when to quicken their pace based on the noise of a train whooshing through the tunnels. And I keep going on the BBC website to check out the hypnotic patterns made by our daily journeys from the recent documentary Britain from Above - streets flowing with besuited people, trains arriving and departing at Clapham Junction, the glowing GPS traces of cars. Speeded up and seen from the air, these movements seem as beautiful and compelling as those of flocking starlings at dusk. </p> <p>Amid all the justified moaning about jams and delays, it is worth remembering that this rush-hour movement of 36 million Britons each day is really a miracle of controlled chaos. The National Travel Survey found that more than half of commuters, both in cars and public transport, have no problems with their daily journey. And even the large minority that do have problems generally arrive at work on time and in one piece, without murdering each other.</p> <p>Vaneigem would probably have put it down to false consciousness, but we shouldn't undervalue the emotional pull of those 1.1 hours, that dead time when we can think, daydream and take stock. One of my students told me that in Second Life, that virtual world online, no one uses the roads or railways because they can simply teleport to their destinations. Nothing comes between the cyber-citizens and their real estate; commuting has been abolished. And part of me thought: what sort of life is that?</p> <p>\u2022 Joe Moran is the author of Queuing for Beginners </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:J.Moran@ljmu.ac.uk\">J.Moran@ljmu.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>You'll remember the Durham fish oil \"trial\" story, possibly the greatest example of scientific incompetence documented from a local authority. Initially it said - to blanket media coverage - that it was running a trial on fish oils, giving pills to 3,000 children to see if it improved GCSE performance. I pointed out, along with several academics, that the experiment was incompetently designed, and would only produce false positive results. The council responded that this was okay, as it hadn't called it a \"trial\".</p> <p>This was untrue: it had, repeatedly, in press releases and interviews, and anyway, whatever you called it, this was still a stupid experiment. Durham's response was to edit the online version of its press release to remove the word \"trial\". Then I asked what it was going to do in this experiment, how it was going to measure results, and more. It refused to give me this information - for an experiment by a public body performed on thousands of children - so I used the Freedom of Information Act. It still refused. Then hundreds of you wrote to its information commissioner, using the FoI, and it refused again, accusing us of running a \"vexacious campaign\".</p> <p>Then the GCSE results for Durham came out. They weren't too great, so I asked for the results of the \"trial\". Durham refused to give me this information. Then it announced, bizarrely, in a formal response to a written question: \"It was never intended, and the county council never suggested, that it would use this initiative to draw conclusions about the effectiveness or otherwise of using fish oil to boost exam results.\"</p> <p>This was, once again, untrue. Durham's own press release had clearly said it was giving out the pills \"to see whether the proven benefits it has already brought children and young people in earlier trials can boost exam performances too\". </p> <p>The council's chief schools inspector, Dave Ford, said: \"The countywide trial will continue until the pupils complete their GCSE examinations next June, and the first test of the supplement's effectiveness will be when they sit their 'mock' exams this December.\"</p> <p>Suddenly this trial did not exist. Now, bafflingly, in defiance of its previous denials, Durham has released some results. \"Detailed analysis of the outcome of the initiative,\" it says, \"shows that pupils who took the Omega-3 supplement did better than those who did not.\" Hardly. Let's try to disentangle what it thinks it has done.</p> <p>\"Initially, just over 3,000 year 11 pupils began the study, taking the Omega-3 tablets at school and at home. By the time GCSE examinations came around, 832 pupils had 80% or greater compliance.\" This is appalling. 2,168 of its subjects dropped out of the trial: it must count these people in the results. It does not. This makes the rest of its claimed results even more meaningless.</p> <p>\"Mr Ford and his colleagues then sought to identify the same number of year 11 pupils who had not taken the supplement and match them to those who had, according to school, gender, prior attainment and social background.\" It originally said it was going to compare children's predicted GCSE performance (whatever on earth that means) against actual performance. It refused to say how it would analyse this, despite hundreds of requests. </p> <p>\"The GCSE results of 629 'matched pairs' - fish oil takers and non-fish oil takers - were then analysed.\"</p> <p>Who are these 629? I thought it was 832? But more importantly, by selectively only looking at the results from the pupils who were most highly adherent to the capsules regime, it has skewed its sample. It has discovered that school performance is better in children who are more highly adherent to a school regime involving pills, and who are, in all probability, also more adherent to everything at school, harder-working, better-performing, and so on.</p> <p>This result has nothing to do with the pills. It is laughably incompetent science. Fish oil pills are the biggest selling food supplement product in the UK, and still no one has ever tested them properly. Durham council had the children, and the pills, necessary to perform a decent piece of research. The only thing it was missing was the rigour. </p> <p>The real question now is this: why has Dave Ford performed an incompetent experiment on thousands of children? And, more importantly, why has Durham council let him?</p>",

  "<p>Ah, the G-string. You've got to love it. I'm wearing one now!\" Jeff Bridges is sitting in the sunny surroundings of one of Santa Monica's beachfront hotels, and, if he is wearing a G-string, it's hidden beneath his blue jeans. Our conversation has turned to skimpy sartorial objects courtesy of Bridges's decision to star in the new Tron movie; as fans of the original 1982 film will recall, back then he wore something that resembled a neon \"mankini\".</p> <p>\"I'm not sure if I'll be wearing that again!\" he laughs. \"Seriously though, doing the new Tron movie is something that is just too good to pass up. It was the same with How To Lose Friends And Alienate People.\" The big-screen adaptation of Toby Young's memoir opens this week with Bridges starring as Clayton Harding, a magazine editor who plays mentor to Simon Pegg's leading man, Sidney Young. The film's director, Curb Your Enthusiasm's Bob Weide, says he saw something of the 58-year-old Californian reflected in the character. \"It had to be Jeff,\" he says, \"he's great at playing rebels.\"</p> <p>It's true - Bridges plays an eminently likable rebel, as with the easy-going dudes in The Last Picture Show, Thunderbolt And Lightfoot and, of course, The Big Lebowski. Yet there is much more to his talent than this. Just consider the increasingly psychotic fellow that he played in Jagged Edge, his eerie alien from Starman, and the quick-witted DJ drowning in depression in The Fisher King. This year he shot his first blockbuster, Iron Man, one of the year's highest-grossing films. Bridges, it seems, is perennially popular, with film-makers, audiences and critics. Indeed, the New York Times once called him \"the best actor alive\". </p> <p>\"Are you serious?\" he roars. \"Man, I spend most of my time trying to avoid work!\"</p> <h2>Q&amp;A</h2> <p><strong>Did your character in How To Lose Friends... feel familiar?

I took little bits<br>from what I'd gleaned about him but I didn't shadow him around the office.</p> <p><strong>Was it tempting to go \"method\" when you were playing The Dude in The Big Lebowski?</strong><br>Hah! Having a smoke all day? No, I didn't do that. It would have been a good excuse to get high, sure, but you can't really work when you're in that state. It's OK for a couple of takes, but you're not going to be able to sustain it all day long. I liked a bit of pot in my youth, though, so I guess I did some memory work.</p> <p><strong>You visited the inaugural Lebowski Fest. What was it like seeing thousands of Dudes?</strong><br>Ah, man, it was great. That was my Beatles moment. I got a little band together and played, unannounced. I came out and played to this sea of Dudes! It was awesome. I hope to return and do some tunes with John Goodman. We'd love to do that one day. Lebowski Fest - it's fantastic fun. There's one coming up but I can't go because I'm off to shoot a film. It has been going on a couple of years now all over the States two days of bowling, music, heavy partying, and all these people are dressed up. You see some of the most obscure references, and the movie plays on the walls all the time.</p> <p><strong>I heard that the girls in the The Big Lebowski dream sequence played a trick on you on set?</strong><br>Oh yeah, that was kind of funny. It was when The Dude sort of flies through all these women's legs, smiling when he's looking up all their skirts. Well there I am, lying back on this skateboard, and when I go under the first girl, she's got all this pubic hair sticking out of her leotard. Then when I went under the next girl, she's got even more hair, the girls were getting bushier and bushier. Basically, all the girls had decided to play a joke to confuse The Dude!</p> <p><strong>Did you ever expect The Dude to be your most successful character?</strong><br>I don't think of it that way. I was nominated for an Academy Award for<br>playing a president, which is about as un-Dude as you can get. Then Iron Man, too, was very un-Dude-like. I love to shake it up and keep my own persona slightly confusing. That way people will be able to slip me into the character at hand.</p> <p><strong>In your next film, Crazy Heart, you play a country singer. That's got to be exciting for a musician, right?</strong><br>Oh yeah! We're shooting that with Maggie Gyllenhaal and Colin Farrell, while T-Bone Burnett - my great friend, we go back to Heaven's Gate - is doing the music. I mean, getting to play a country singer and work with T-Bone, this was an easy one to say \"yes\" to. I get to play music too.</p> <p><strong>Iron Man turned out to be one of the biggest films of the year. Why do your first big blockbuster now?</strong><br>The big draw for me with Iron Man was [director] Jon Favreau. I got the<br>script and wasn't sure I wanted to do it, but when I heard that Jon was<br>involved\u2026 I was a big fan of his from the moment I saw him in Swingers,<br>and I'd been following his career. I found it intriguing to have him directing a big comic book movie. When he told me he had Robert Downey Jr, I thought that'd be wonderful. Jon had a very hard time convincing the powers that be that Robert was the right man, but he was such a wonderful off beat choice.</p> <p><strong>You've been busy this year, but over the last couple of years you've made fewer movies. Why?</strong><br>I spend a lot of time trying to resist doing anything, really! Honestly, there are a lot of things I love to do other than making movies, and I know that once I commit to a film it's going to prevent me from doing any of these other things. So I do try and not commit; I try hard not to engage. But sometimes there's an element in it which I just can't resist. It changes with each movie. You can just get a feeling, and you don't know what that is until you do the movie.</p> <p><strong>Is that why you signed up for the new Tron movie?</strong><br>Yeah, that's another unique, wild experience that was too good to turn down. Engaging in that world again feels just like it did all that time ago. Basically, I'm still a child, I love being childlike, and here was another chance to play with these crazy toys. And the cutting-edge technology makes it exciting. Doing the teaser trailer for Comic-Con, I had my first experience of motion capture. And that's turning the industry on its head. It's amazing being part of that.</p> <p><strong>There's such a retro love for Tron. How do you bring it up to date?</strong><br>Well, when we made Tron there was no internet, no cellphones. But now we have motion capture, so I think we'll get a far more successful version of the story, which is someone literally getting sucked into a video game. When we did King Kong in the 70s, one minute you'd have a shot of Rick Baker in this big suit and then you'd cut to this 80ft stiff model, and they looked nothing alike. Compare to that Peter Jackson's King Kong the technology is there and they did a wonderful job. I thought they created a beautiful Kong. So I hope that'll be the same for Tron.</p> <p>\u2022 How To Lose Friends... is out on Friday</p>",
  "<p>Charlie and Caroline Gladstone were, 17-odd years ago, a double-income couple raising one small child in a comfortable London pad. Today, they run their own business and live in a 15-bedroom Victorian shooting lodge in rural Scotland with six children and five dogs. </p> <p>On the pages of their mail-order catalogue, Pedlars, the Gladstones' life looks pretty idyllic - an endless round of camp-fire picnics and traditional family games - but how do two people who run a business, a large house and an enormous menagerie of dependants (there are horses and chickens here, too) have time to sleep, let alone play mini golf and knock up daily hampers of egg-and-cress sandwiches? </p> <p>\"We work incredibly hard,\" Charlie says. The labour is roughly divided down traditional lines: he runs the businesses (Pedlars is only one of several ventures) while Caroline take care of the kids and the house, but their roles do merge. Charlie's office is in the house, enabling him to \"work all hours and still be around for bath time\", while Caroline is a key component of the Pedlars setup, styling the catalogues and organising the publicity for the shop. \"It all entails a lot of juggling so I have to be hyper-organised,\" she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338020874\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/09/26/2709_homesfeature_3_sp.jpg\" alt=\"Space feature\" width=\"220\" height=\"310\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It sounds exhausting. Caroline says she is \"blessed with extreme energy\" and the move to Glen Dye was never about downshifting: it was about the house. Set above a river in 45 acres of rugged countryside west of Aberdeen, Glen Dye had everything the couple were looking for in a family home: character, potential and masses of space. (It was built to accommodate shooting parties, so there are lots of small bedrooms and bathrooms.) The only downside was that, having been used solely as a holiday house since the 20s, it was almost uninhabitable.</p> <p>\"There was no central heating, no working wiring, every window needed replacing, and if you touched the whitewashed walls, the paint came off on your hands,\" Charlie says. </p> <p>The renovations took eight years, during which time they had five more children and launched their mail-order business. It was a risk: the mail-order homewares market was in its infancy, and neither Charlie nor Caroline had any first-hand retail experience (she was home furnishing product designer at Laura Ashley, he was in the music business), but both loved \"stuff\" (Charlie is a lifelong collector) and had absolute faith in their own taste.</p> <p>\"I love clutter, and detest the modern, clinical style,\" Charlie says, \"because it doesn't reflect the warmth that's the core of a family home. But the clutter has to be organised. Everything on display has a story or some personal history.\" Even potentially mundane things, such as pencils, look interesting if they're well arranged, he says. \"And anything - a postcard, a note or a ticket - can be framed. We lean them on mantelpieces or shelves so we can move them around.\"</p> <p>The Gladstones' business strategy was simple, but it worked - the catalogue's customer base is currently pushing 50,000 and they have just opened their first retail store in one of west London's hippest streets. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338020875\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/09/26/homesfeat2_03_wsp_0927_108.jpg\" alt=\"The Gladstone family \u0096 Space Feature\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Which means that Charlie is now working even harder - and isn't around for quite so many bath times. He says he's the one with the passionate interest in graphic design, which is why Pedlars stocks so many bits of typography, but you can't help wondering whether it's Caroline who has brought in all the items bearing the motto \"Keep Calm And Carry On\". </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Pedlars, 128 Talbot Road, London W11 (01330 850400; <a href=\"http://www.pedlars.co.uk\">pedlars.co.uk</a>)</p>",

  "<p>The Seat Ibiza is what's known as a \"supermini\", which is essentially a more exciting way - how could it not be? - of saying \"small hatchback\". In effect, that's also the aim of its new design: to find a more exciting way of saying \"small hatchback\".</p> <p>Alas, it's not possible to be too exciting with small hatchbacks, because then they would probably become expensive small hatchbacks, thereby defeating the purpose of the whole concept - an affordable little car for the masses, or, more accurately, thrifty but style-conscious urbanites.</p> <p>The Spanish-based Seat (it sort of rhymes with Fiat, the company on which it was originally modelled) has ambitions to make major inroads into the supermini market, a sector already jammed with such models as the VW Polo and the Skoda Fabia. Both those cars happen to fall under the capacious Volkswagen umbrella, as does Seat, another subsidiary of VW, and the Ibiza shares a great many parts and underpinnings with its sister cars. As they're all more or less cannibalised versions of each other, the competition is perhaps less about performance than appearance. And the new Ibiza, like so many visitors to the holiday island from which it takes its name, looks determined to make the most of its modest assets.</p> <p>The chassis boasts more creases than a New Romantic's trousers. Along the side doors and panels runs a funky, Z-shaped line, as if at some point in its assembly the car had enjoyed an uncomfortably close encounter with Zorro.</p> <p>Assuming the Errol Flynn or Antonio Banderas role at Seat is one Luc Donckerwolke. With a name like that, you could do with a compensating sense of splendour. And Donckerwolke, Seat's chief designer, is no slouch when it comes to flamboyant gestures of elegance. He used to work for Lamborghini, where he conceived the Murcielago, a terrifying \u00fcberbabe of a sports car.</p> <p>The move to Seat must have been a bit like giving up epic poetry to become a tabloid journalist, which may explain the origin of the Ibiza's decorative flourishes. But has the lusty spirit of a 6.2 litre Murcielago - top speed 205mph - been infused into the functional confines of a 1.6 litre Ibiza? </p> <p>Well, not exactly, but it does suggest sportiness, which is no mean achievement for a five-door supermini. Apparently, this update is roomier than its predecessor, though the back seats are still suitable only for children or people who enjoy flying long-haul in economy. What's more, it's even quite perky in town traffic, nipping and tucking with the ease of a busy cosmetic surgeon.</p> <p>On the motorway, however, it's better to forget all about Donckerwolke's Lamborghini roots. Especially when going uphill. Driving to Dorset, I spent extended periods with my foot pressing the accelerator pedal right down. Granted, this seemed to cause more stress to my ankle than it did to the car, which behaved as if it were on cruise control. Nonetheless, it's probably wise to avoid getting into burn-offs with any passing Porsches.</p> <p>But then you don't buy a supermini to hang out in the fast lane. And in any case, outside of the dodgems, when do you ever get the thrill of \"flooring\" a car? Certainly not in a Lamborghini.</p> <h2>Seat Ibiza 1.6 16V 105PS</h2> <p><strong>Price:</strong> From \u00a310,895<br><strong>Top speed</strong> 116mph<br><strong>Acceleration</strong> 0-62 in 10.5 seconds<br><strong>Consumption</strong> 42.8mpg<br><strong>CO\u00b2 emissions</strong> 157g/km<br><strong>Eco rating</strong> 6/10<br><strong>At the wheel</strong> Victoria Pendleton<br><strong>In a word</strong> Balearic</p>",
  "<h2>Do we really know what goes on in space?</h2> <p>Conspiracy theorists who believe the moon landing and all other space exploration has been faked could be feeling a little vindicated by the news that Chinese state media fudged a report on the launch of the Shenzhou VII spacecraft.</p> <p>On Thursday the Xinhua news agency described the take-off - even quoting conversation between the \"taikonauts\" (below). The only problem was that the spacecraft was still on the ground.</p> <p>The story was removed by the end of the day and Xinhua described its publication as a \"technical error\". But it highlights that when it comes to what goes on in space, we Earthlings have to rely on what we're told. The Chinese propaganda was only exposed because of the early publication - if the story had gone up on time, would anyone be the wiser?</p> <p>It's not the first time. The Soviet authorities originally claimed Laika the dog died after a week in space, but it was later revealed she died within hours of take-off. And in 1961 Yuri Gagarin released a pre-prepared statement about his \"normal landing\", despite having parachuted from 20,000 feet.</p> <p>There are reliable unofficial sources, however. \"There's a bunch of fairly talented amateurs who spend a lot of time tracking spacecraft and listening to their communications,\" says Chris Welch, lecturer in astronautics at Kingston University. These space-age versions of the trainspotter are the reason we know about many US intelligence satellites that are not officially acknowledged. Pupils at Kettering grammar school in Northamptonshire were even the first to discover Russian satellite launches.</p> <p>Publishing stories before they happen is not unique to space reportage. In 2007 the Daily Telegraph's US editor reported Saddam Hussein's execution before the event. Obituaries are often written early and updated - a fact that backfired for Bloomberg in August when it published one for the still-very-much-alive Apple boss Steve Jobs. </p> <p><strong>Caitlin Fitzsimmons</strong></p> <h2>Has music become too loud?</h2> <p>Heavy Metal Fans Claim Music Too Loud sounds like a joke headline, but when sound engineer Ted Jensen, who mastered Metallica's Death Magnetic album, recently admitted to disgruntled fans: \"I'm not proud to be associated with this one,\" he highlighted the phenomenon of the \"loudness wars\" which has been escalating over the past decade. </p> <p>A CD's loudness (known in the industry as \"hotness\") is increased by heavily compressing (\"brickwall limiting\") the music during remastering to close the gap between average and peak volume. If the sound of an older CD is a thin line oscillating with the dynamics of the music, a modern one is thicker and more uniform. </p> <p>\"Hot\" mastering first gained popularity in the early 1990s. Gradually, loudness became an arms race, with few artists willing to sacrifice impact for subtlety. Recent offenders include Arctic Monkeys and Lily Allen. The advantages are obvious. \"Hot\" CDs have more impact in noisy cars and crowded bars. The typical average volume in 1985 was -18db. Today, it is -3db. The closer you get to 0db, the less room the music has for colour and warmth, and the flatter and harsher it becomes. In some cases, this results in distortion. Bob Dylan said of modern CDs \"atrocious: they have sound all over them\". Most listeners don't notice this, although the Red Hot Chili Peppers' 1999 album Californication is so notoriously over-compressed that there is an online petition to get it remastered.</p> <p>Ted Jensen, who claims the Death Magnetic tracks were \"brickwalled\" before he got them, hopes the fuss will encourage a return to dynamic range. As Steely Dan's Donald Fagen told Rolling Stone: \"God is in the details. But there are no details anymore.\" </p> <p><strong>Dorian Lynskey</strong></p> <h2>Can short-selling be ethical?</h2> <p>Some financial practices have always sat uneasily with religions. Sharia law, for example, prohibits payment of interest - which mainstream Christianity took centuries to accept. Amid the recent financial turmoil, Church of England leaders including the Archbishop of Canterbury voiced criticism of \"short selling\", or betting on shares, commodities or financial indices falling in value.</p> <p>When it emerged that the church had lent stock to short-sellers, the bishops were accused of hypocrisy.</p> <p>Ethical investment decisions generally concern the stocks themselves, with tobacco and arms among those most often avoided. The church commissioners' ethical advisory committee approves the practice of lending out stock for short-selling - a strategy common among most large investment funds. But that was before the impression took hold of City traders betting against our most trusted financial institutions, and short-selling was temporarily banned. The church was also revealed to have bet against currencies rising and falling. Airlines take such bets on the price of oil to offset future rises in their fuel bills. This kind of short-selling, known as hedging, is designed to insulate companies from volatile movements. The chancellor, Alistair Darling, tried to draw a distinction between what he calls \"legitimate hedging\" and \"speculation that can be harmful\".</p> <p>In the current stock market chaos senior figures blamed hedge funds short-selling shares, but many market professionals believe short-sellers, by betting that shares are overvalued, create a vital tension in a market. Without it, prices are falsely inflated. In China the CSI 300 index of leading stocks ballooned before losing more than half its value this year. Regulators yesterday said they were planning to revoke the ban on short-selling in the hope of restoring faith in a functioning market.</p> <p>\"Short selling is the pursuit of truth and knowledge,\" says Hugh Hendry, of hedge fund Eclectica Asset Management. \"Speculators are merely the messengers.\" </p> <p><strong>Simon Bowers</strong></p>",
  "<p>It has been a quick and easy journey, but the village square of Champoluc seems a world away from home. We arrive as the last rays of the afternoon sun are warming the cream and pink stucco of the church tower, and the locals are coming out for the evening passagiato.</p> <p>There's a smell of wood smoke and pine trees. Children play on the steps of the shop beside the church, peering through the windows at the elaborate displays of biscuits and cakes. Though we've barely unpacked, it's already clear that if you want to get away from it all, this is the perfect resort. </p> <p>Champoluc sits at the end of the Val d'Ayas, one of three adjacent valleys that make up the Monterosa ski area. Over the hill from Champoluc is tiny Gressoney-la-Trinit\u00e9, and beyond that is beautiful Alagna, a resort revered for its extreme off-piste terrain. The contrast with the more famous three valleys, the Trois Vall\u00e9es in France, couldn't be greater. Those Trois Vall\u00e9es, comprising Courchevel, M\u00e9ribel and Val Thorens, are Britain's favourite place to ski, attracting 300,000 of us every year. In M\u00e9ribel, which alone gets 150,000 Brits annually (and was founded by a British colonel) it feels as if you can go days without hearing a local voice.</p> <p>But though Turin airport is only a 90-minute drive from Champoluc, few Brits have even heard of Monterosa, let alone visited it, and its villages still feel like authentic Italian farming communities. </p> <p>\"This isn't Chamonix - there are no clubs, no casino, not even a swimming pool, and the most exciting shop in town is the butcher's,\" says Simon Brown, who moved here with his family nine years ago to run Ski2, one of the very few tour operators that brings people to the village. </p> <p>Robin, the photographer, and I stroll off from the village square with the rest of the early evening throng, following the half-frozen stream, past the little open-air ice rink on its banks and the cluster of venerable wood-clad hotels, to the base of the main lift, where a few skiers are toasting their day's exploits in a couple of bars. Anyone seeking wild apr\u00e8s-ski of the dancing in ski-boots on tables variety will be sorely disappointed, but Champoluc oozes laid-back charm. </p> <p>Up on the mountain, the relaxed, small-town vibe persists. The next morning, our first on skis, we find the wide, open pistes are utterly deserted. A couple of the chairlifts are old and slow, but there's no one else around, so never any queues. The only time we see a big group of other people, it turns out to be the ski club from the village school, bombing down in their matching helmets to their parents waiting at the bottom of the slope. We stand on the empty piste, look up at the Matterhorn, and imagine the packed runs of Zermatt, the world-famous resort on the other side of the mountain. </p> <p>But though all of Monterosa's villages are tiny, the ski area they collectively muster is not to be sniffed at - there are a total of 37 lifts and 180km of pistes. It's high and snowsure too - Champoluc sits at 1,580m and the lifts extend to just under 3,000m. Plus Monterosa is one of the best places in Europe to get a taste of heliskiiing. Single day trips are easily booked, cost around \u20ac250, and let you ski high on the Monte Rosa glacier and, if you like, down to Zermatt, off-piste all the way.</p> <p>Lunch takes us even further away from it all. We turn left from the Del Lago piste, and swing through some trees into a little hidden valley. Perched at 2,000m in a clearing below us is Stadel Soussun, an ancient wooden hamlet. There are a couple of old houses, and a tiny chapel big enough for a congregation of four. </p> <p>The hamlet's main house is now a restaurant with rooms (0039 348 6527222, <a href=\"http://www.stadelsoussun.com\">stadelsoussun.com</a>, 80pp per night half-board), and we creak open the heavy wooden door to find a big antique table set and waiting for us. The walls and vaulted ceiling are rough stone and hung with brass pots and old climbers' rucksacks. At one end, a big wooden dresser groans under the weight of red wine bottles. </p> <p>There's no menu, so Stephania, the curly-haired waitress, just reads out what they have. There's steak with juniper berries and goulash, but we opt for Moretti beers and a huge plate of cheese, dried meats and sausage. It's rounded off in proper Italian fashion with shots of homemade genepy, made with the artemisia flower that grows nearby - on the house of course. </p> <p>Upstairs are seven beautiful double rooms in what used to be the grain store. As she shows us around, Stephania explains that the house has always been in the current owner, Sergio's, family. When I ask how old it is, she points to a coat of arms carved into a rafter, alongside the date it was built - 1518. </p> <p>From the piste map it looks as if it's impossible to get back to the slopes from here without a long walk uphill. But, genepy shots downed, the boss fires up his piste basher, we jump in the back, and he drives up a snowy track to the nearest lift.</p> <p>Stadel Soussun is a unique place to stay, but Champoluc is full of good hotels. We're at the comfortable, traditional, Relais des Glaciers (+0125 308 300, <a href=\"http://www.hotelrelaisdesglaciers .com\">hotelrelaisdesglaciers.com</a>); the best in town is the five-star Breithorn (+0125 308 734, <a href=\"http://www.breithornhotel.com\">breithornhotel.com</a>); but those looking for something a bit different should try the Hotel California (+0125 307 977), on the outskirts of the village. As the owner, Guido, shows us around he explains that he's a big fan of rock music from the 60s and 70s, and that his hotel is a tribute to his obsession. A huge Wurlitzer dominates the lobby, and each of the 12 rooms is named after a different singer or group. We check out Bob Dylan, and as Guido proudly flips the light switch, the stereo automatically cranks up: \"How many roads must a man walk down ...\" Each room has music recorded by its namesake, which continues for 90 seconds after you turn on the light. Neat, but it could get annoying, especially if you are just getting up for the loo in the night. </p> <p>We're only here for the weekend, so on Sunday, we head out to explore the rest of Monterosa's three valleys. We sweep down to Gressoney, from where two seemingly endless gondolas take us up to the Passo Salati at 2,971m. From the pass, we peer down towards Alagna, lost in a deep fold in the valley below. </p> <p>Champoluc feels like it's marooned in a gentler age, but if you really want to escape the modern world, come up to this ridge, then traverse right, following the wooden signpost, to the Rifugio Guglielmina (+0163 91444, <a href=\"http://www.rifugioguglielmina.com\">rifugioguglielmina.com</a>, \u20ac50 per night half-board), a refuge clinging to the mountainside at 2,880m. As we arrive, Alberto Calaba, the owner, is making the final preparations for lunch. His family built the place in 1878, although today it's all far slicker, after a major renovation in 2007. There's now heat and light in every room, plus Alberto's pride and joy, the extensive wine cellar, which he drags me behind the bar to see. \"I have 7,000 bottles from Aosta, Piemonte, Tuscany and Sicily - all Italian, of course!\" he says. </p> <p>We may be in a remote setting atop a mountain, but these days the world is a small place. As diners start to take their seats on the large, sun-drenched terrace, many of them stunned to silence by the view, Massimo, one of the waiters, shows me around the bedrooms. He casually mentions that he only moved to this high-altitude outpost a fortnight ago, after 12 years living in Brixton. Talk about getting away from it all ...</p> <p>From the refuges, it's a thigh-busting 1,680m non-stop descent all the way to Alagna. While Champoluc is great for families and fast intermediate cruising, this valley is for the experts. There are only four lifts and a couple of pistes, but the wild mountainside above the village is covered in long, steep, off-piste routes.

  "<p><strong>How do we ensure our boys won't be sexist?</strong></p> <p><strong>We have two adolescent sons. How do we encourage in them a positive, healthy and respectful attitude towards masculinity, women, sex and sexuality when they are bombarded with negative, oppressive, distorted stereotypes of all these by the media, gaming and music industries (little of which they have access to at home as a result)? KI, on the talkboard </strong></p> <p>You could just as easily ask the same of adolescent daughters regarding the pressure to primp/wax/slim/preen/pout and forever have a workable combination of home/work. The answer to both is to set a good example yourselves and show that this is compatible with being happy. <strong>DA,</strong> on the talkboard</p> <p>Teach them to iron and cook and how to wash their clothes, too. Nothing was more attractive to me at university than a man who could do his own laundry. My mother-in-law had three sons and when her eldest (my husband) turned 12, she noticed he was starting to turn into a bit of a rebel. That was when she moved them from the middle of a northern city centre to the Lake District. Best thing she said she ever did. Lots of fresh air and mountains to keep them out of trouble. <strong>NV,</strong> on the talkboard</p> <p>I think the biggest influence on how boys grow up to treat women is seeing how the men in their lives (especially their dad) treat women. <strong>FY,</strong> on the talkboard</p> <p>My partner and I are always openly affectionate and loving towards each other in front of our 20-month-old son. We try not to shout or argue in front of him (we don't do much of that anyway) and when he went through a phase of pulling his mum's hair hard and pinching her arms a few months ago, I showed him by example how to be gentle with her instead, which seemed to work pretty well as he now strokes her rather than pulls or pinches. Quite how much effect this will have in future years I'm not sure. <strong>SF,</strong> on the talkboard</p> <p>All the wonderful men with a good attitude towards women have either had strong mothers or strong sisters. The more females they know in a non-sexual sense, the less likely they are to give credence to stereotypes. One of my friends was raised by a single mum and has a great bond with his sister. He is just used to getting on with women, and it shows. <strong>KR, </strong>on the talkboard</p> <p>What you also need to do is reassure them that there are girls out there who find non-macho, unstereotypical boys attractive. One of the hardest things about growing up as a non-typical lad is the sheer preponderance of girls who seem drawn to the loud, sexist Jack-the-lad/frat boy type. <strong>JM,</strong> on the talkboard</p> <p>Tell them to marry a woman who loves (and likes) her father. My father used to tell me that - I don't think he realised how right he was. <strong>CD,</strong> on the talkboard</p> <p>I have two young sons and squirm when we watch some of the macho rap artists on MTV, surrounded by submissive women, and we've had long talks about homophobia, which seems a big issue among boys who habitually use the word \"gay\" as an insult. I'd just keep talking to them; not in order to force your views on them, but to get them to question what they're being served up by the media. <strong>EF,</strong> by email</p> <p>I think they need their social groups expanding so that they have more contact with older boys who have got out of adolescence. My sons' four male cousins are about six and eight years older. Their scoffing at 15-year-old male \"wisdom\" soon made our two wise up. <strong>VD,</strong> on the talkboard</p> <h2> Any answers</h2> <p><strong>Have you had to set the ground rules for other people's children in your house?

  "<p>Kylie Minogue will apparently pocket a seven-figure sum for a one-off performance at a private party in Dubai. It is claimed she could earn as much as $4m (\u00a32.2m) for the gig in November, which will mark the opening of a luxury hotel.</p> <p>That's all well and good, but most of us probably couldn't even afford to hire Kylie's left hand to tap out the rhythm to the Locomotion. What if you would like some quality entertainment at your event but for a smaller fee? Not much good trying the Rolling Stones - they played a Texan billionaire's 60th birthday party at a cost of \u00a33.5m. Still, you can get Sir Elton John, Rod Stewart or Robbie Williams - when he's not off searching for UFOs - for \u00a31m each. </p> <p>Sir Paul McCartney is said to be available for half that fee, while Sting has relatively competitive rates, having played at a Bill Gates bash in New York for \u00a3250,000.</p> <p>If that still seems a little steep for your sister's 30th birthday party, how about some music recorded by the same big names played by your favourite DJ? It's party time, and the occasion needs to be celebrated with food, friends and fine wine. </p> <p>Once the nibbles are gone and there are 10 empty green bottles standing on the wall, guests will feel compelled to start convulsing rhythmically to an array of sounds provided by your hired entertainment.</p> <p>A professional \"superstar DJ\" will, of course, set you back a small fortune. Fatboy Slim - who is playing on Brighton's seafront tonight - could cost anything in the region of \u00a325,000 to \u00a3125,000 for a private party. But talent doesn't have to be an extortionate drain on the bank account. </p> <p>If you manage to get your hands on a student who fancies themselves as the next big thing and who needs a little extra cash, then you may be able to book your DJ for next to nothing, plus a few drinks and a cab home. </p> <p>House music DJ Seb Fontaine started out earning \u00a330 a night spinning tunes at a club on the Kings Road in Chelsea.</p> <p>Musical taste should probably dictate the direction you begin your research. If your teenage son is heavily into hip-hop, the best-known DJ for that style of music in the UK is Tim Westwood, the host of Radio One's flagship rap show. For a four-hour set Westwood will charge around \u00a33,500. However, if you start to move down the scale of celebrity to a lesser-known host on BBC 1Xtra such as the Mobo-nominated DJ Semtex or the tag team of Ace &amp; Vis, you could probably pick up two hours of musical talent and expertise for about \u00a3500 in addition to a booking fee.</p> <p>If you are looking for something cheaper but require a level of professionalism above the student option, there are thousands of part-time disc jockeys in clubs and bars up and down the country who would be grateful to get another gig, and may well be happy to provide music all night for less than \u00a3200. If you see someone you like while out enjoying a tipple, ask for their contact details and a quote.</p> <p>You are then lumbered with the task of finding a suitable venue with the right equipment as the higher-priced DJs won't provide anything except the music. Most bars and clubs have the equipment installed already, though you are advised to check exactly what gear the DJ requires, and if the venue does not supply this you will be looking at further hire costs.</p> <p>Some party organisers will be after something a little more nostalgic - maybe a selection of golden oldies for that 40th wedding anniversary in a pub's function suite or the church hall. The Elite Disco Service in south London quote a fee of \u00a3220 for five hours of music, equipment and a light show. Many mobile discos will allow you to provide your own playlist, and may even be able to source that rare track your parents had their first boogie to.</p> <p>Or you could ignore all the above and pick up a copy of the latest Now That's What I Call Music compilation, or hook up your MP3 player to a decent sound system, and you have got a party at a fraction of the price where the musical choices are yours alone.</p>",
  "<p>Although George Bush wasn't at the Republican National Convention, his presence was keenly felt, in the form of an ambient pandering to \"the average Joe\". During the 2004 election, much was made of the fact that \"the average guy\" would rather have a beer with Bush than with John Kerry, since Bush was a C student who mangled his words, didn't know much about foreign countries and sometimes wore a cowboy hat. This idea still pervades US politics, although last time I checked, \"the average Joe\" hadn't had a beer with either Bush or Kerry, and in fact had gone from beer to whiskey because his home was in foreclosure, and his investments had vanished in the stock market swoon, and two of his sons were in Iraq, and he was fading fast because he had cancer and no health insurance.</p> <p>At the convention, nearly every speaker made a point of underscoring his or her humble origin. There were a lot of wry shakes of the head at the elitist foibles of the Democrats, who'd all been hopelessly corrupted and led away from common sense for ever by \"their prestigious Ivy League educations\" (this to be said with a sneer). Suddenly, it was a bad thing to have gone to Harvard and Yale. The Republican party, they seemed to be saying, is not just the party of the rich. It is, actually, the party of the poor. The poor who, through hard work, pull themselves up out of poverty. Yes: the Republicans believe in working hard. But not too hard. If one works too hard, one might find himself at a \"prestigious Ivy League university\". This would be terrible. That is where elitists like Barack Obama are bred. Obama, to his credit, was originally poor, but then screwed it up by going not to a mediocre state college where he did only so-so, but to Columbia, one of our finest universities, and then to law school at - you guessed it (said with a sneer) - Harvard.</p> <p>Republicans are, above all, non-elitists. They believe in the primacy of the average person. Hence the presence of Sarah Palin on the ticket. She is, we heard over and over, a \"hockey mom\". But this raises a question. If you believe in promoting the average over the \"elite\" (ie the exceptional), why choose Palin who, after all, is a gifted speaker, a college graduate, pretty, charming - a governor of an entire state, for God's sake - over some less exceptional hockey mom who, say, didn't go to college and can't read, and in fact breaks into a rash if she even sees a letter of the alphabet, and is hideous to behold, and puts her words in random order? That's about as anti-elitist as it gets, and would really appeal to \"the average Joe\", as soon as he stops weeping and sobers up a bit.</p>",

  "<p>I yield to few in my love of gadgets: let a new gizmo arrive in the post or be brought back from the shops and you will see me fall on it like a lion on an antelope - I will savage the hard, clear, welded plastic packaging with my teeth and let out growls of drooling hunger and mews of pleasure. Out tumbles the doodad and straight away I will plug it in, install its drivers, power it up and connect it, and to hell with the manual. No matter how gimcrack or futile the toy might be, the adrenaline will surge, the lips part and the breathing come in shallow stertorous pants of ecstasy. </p> <p>Actually, there's a rider to that - aside from apologising for using the phrase \"pants of ecstasy\", I ought to make it clear that there is one genre of gadget that over the years has proved so preternaturally disappointing, so remorselessly useless, that I receive it with dread. I am talking about the so-called Universal Remote Control. I have drawers full of them. Over the years I have bought more than 50, and not one was any use. Someone gave me a cheap market stall giant URC as a joke and that - oddly enough - is the only one I use, but it is configured only for the TV, which brings me to the principles underlying these wastes of plastic.</p> <p>It ought to make so much sense. We sit hunched on our sofas while a lapping tide of remote controls surges towards us, threatening to flood every spare square inch of surface. Why not unite them into one remote? It really ought to work, I do see that. And yet... The configuration processes, whether by code look-up table, online software connection or IR \"learning\", never work satisfactorily, unless I have been unlucky 50 times on the bounce, which is possible, if statistically improbable. I won't claim they have never worked, but they have proved more cumbersome and annoying than the problems they were designed to solve. Maybe it is just me, but some mixture of muscle memory and brain mapping has meant that I have been happier with the complicated routines of the six or seven devices I know than with the streamlined convenience of one URC.</p> <p>It was with low expectations, then, that I unpacked the Logitech Harmony One and the Philips Prestigo SRU 8015. Each has a colour LCD screen and claims to solve your remote control problems in one fell swoop with ease and power. After half an hour with each, I wanted to hurl them out of the window. They are not as dreadful as what has gone before, they are much worse: worse because there is so much more (badly implemented) technology to come between the problem and the solution. They both come - and this should alert anyone with an eye sensitive to technology - in the shiny piano black that was fashionable some years ago. Both Logitech and Philips have always had poor design sense, and this is demonstrated by their desire to copy colours and forms precisely at the moment they become tired and dated. But that shouldn't matter if the functions are taken care of.</p> <p>The Harmony One is configured with your DVD, satellite, TV, amplifier and games machine by connecting it via USB to an online computer. You go through a tedious and ill-designed process, on PC or Mac (beware the Mac online update to the software that comes bundled with the remote - it simply does not work: I am not alone in finding this out; forums and user group sites are alive with furious users who have had to uninstall the update) and eventually five or six of your devices can be controlled by the Harmony handset. Only they can't, because the system stinks.</p> <p>The maddeningly non-intuitive Philips Prestigo uses inbuilt codes and works little better. Between them these two useless implements have sucked four hours out of my life. Usually I don't mind when time is frittered away in digital device play, but somehow when it is lost trying to use objects whose only purpose is to simplify and harmonise, I get very cross indeed.</p> <h2>Initials of the week</h2> <p><strong>URC</strong> Universal Remote Control or Useless Rotten Crud...</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 The variegated grass Phalaris arundinacea, or gardener's garters, is too invasive for many gardens, but has tended to thrive where other grasses have petered out, perhaps due to the damp soil.</p> <p>\u2022 Monocultures of brightly coloured grasses echo the crops of the past and are never high enough to block the views of the modern-day fields beyond.</p> <p>\u2022 Box hedges are kept low, so they can be crossed with an easy stride to make movement from one compartment to another as simple as possible when tending the garden.</p> <p>\u2022 Ferns and Carex pendula (in the foreground) are welcome visitors, and are allowed to distribute themselves wherever they wish.</p> <p>\u2022 Standing stones, a feature of the local landscape, have been placed within the garden to make a connection with an ancient past.</p> <p>The creators of the gardens at Veddw eschew the idea of endless flowers and mixed borders. Instead, Anne Wareham and Charles Hawes have created a garden based on ideas rather than on conventional horticultural formulas.</p> <p>Although some of the ideas are perhaps a little overegged - for example, the curve-backed bench cut in a naive wave to look like the Monmouthshire hills - others are sublime. Wareham has based the layout of the garden's grasses parterre (pictured) on a tithe map from the 1840s, with box hedges mimicking the original pattern of field boundaries. This field system in miniature makes an intellectual connection with the rolling farmland beyond and immediately anchors the garden in its surroundings. </p> <p>As Wareham says, the parterre \"has the essential virtue of being a low, flat planting, so it doesn't obscure the view over the Veddw valley\".</p> <p>The garden is large - two acres of woods matched by a similar sized ornamental garden - and the plant palette is restricted to introduce order and tranquillity. Yet Wareham allows rosebay willowherb to self-seed, and even grows named cultivars of this invasive weed.

  "<p>For a party that has proudly wrapped itself in the union flag until relatively recently, Dominic Grieve must be seen as something of an interloper. The new shadow home secretary is, to put things delicately, not entirely British. \"I was educated like a little French boy between the ages of four and eight,\" Grieve says. \"In fact I suspect that I spoke French before I spoke English.\"</p> <p>Grieve's background - his French mother sent him to the Lyc\u00e9e in London while his father, Percy, was a Tory MP - marks him out as a distinctive figure in David Cameron's team.</p> <p>With the clipped tones of a QC who has earned himself a reputation for great precision at the Commons despatch box, Grieve's tall and patrician figure appears to embody the perfect Tory. Switch on French television, however, and the MP for Beaconsfield often pops up - \"I pass for a Frenchman most of the time\" - to explain how the Tories have moved on from the days of Margaret Thatcher.</p> <p>Just as outsiders may find it difficult to pigeonhole Grieve, some Cameroons fluttering around the Tory leader also struggle with the shadow home secretary. Until now the \"big three\" members of the shadow cabinet after Cameron were appointed because they were either members of his tribe (George Osborne) or because they reached out to traditional parts of the Conservative party (William Hague and David Davis).</p> <p>Grieve rewrote the rules in June when he was catapulted from the relatively obscure role of shadow attorney general to become shadow home secretary after Davis resigned to fight a one-man crusade in favour of civil liberties. Like Davis, Grieve is a passionate supporter of civil liberties who has no truck with the government's 42-day terror detention plan. Osborne and Michael Gove needed a lot of persuading to oppose the government with fears that the Tories could be devastated by \"a Madrid\", a reference to how a major terrorist attack would leave them exposed.</p> <p>Grieve says the shadow cabinet is completely united, though he has no time for the Madrid argument. \"The fact there's an awful terrorist attack doesn't justify going beyond 28 days. Terrorist outrages can't be stopped by detaining people for long periods.\"</p> <p>Grieve says he would need new evidence - not a terror attack - to support extending the detention of suspects. \"It is true that if there are other plots discovered, or other circumstances, then that might contribute to evidence emerging about need for more time.\"</p> <p>Grieve has also been thinking deeply about the \"terrible\" impact of multiculturalism which has, he believes, compartmentalised people from different traditions and downplayed the identity of white Britons. \"We've actually done something terrible to ourselves in Britain,\" says Grieve who was asked by former Tory leader Ian Duncan Smith to look at community cohesion in 2002.</p> <p>\"In the name of trying to prepare people for some new multicultural society we've told people, particularly long-term inhabitants, 'Well your cultural background isn't really very important, or it's flawed, or you shouldn't be worrying about it'. And then we've been shocked that far from producing the new model citizen who easily adapts to multiculturalism, people are very resistant, very fearful and very lacking in self-confidence. And we have the same problem with some second- and third-generation immigrant communities who say they don't know what British values are and that they're alienated.\"</p> <p>The vacuum created by multiculturalism is to blame for extremists on either side of the spectrum. \"In this vacuum, both the BNP and Hizb ut-Tahrir rise. They are two very similar phenomena experiencing a form of cultural despair about themselves and their identities. And it's terribly easy to latch on to confrontational and aggressive variants of their cultural background as being the only way to reassure themselves that they can survive.\"</p> <p>Grieve feels uneasy about the restriction of debate by what he calls \"fundamental Islam\". \"Our country has adapted because people have been tolerant, which has often required a lot of forbearance and acceptance of things they didn't like. That is how Britain has evolved. When I address an Islamic audience I always point this out.\"</p> <p>An Anglican, who is a member of the London Diocesan Synod of the Church of England, Grieve draws a historical parallel. \"Britain's been through all this before. We've had a reformation. We've had a civil war all about it. And the polemics about Roman Catholics and Jews in the 19th century. But we did this without suppressing the discussion.\"</p> <p>As one of the few frontline politicians to talk openly about his faith, Grieve says Britain should be proud of the contribution made by all the major religions, including Islam, in shaping the country. But he says people should not forget Britain's Christian heritage.</p> <p>\"The role of Christianity is really rather important. It can't just be magicked out of the script. It colours many of the fundamental viewpoints of British people, including many who have never been in a church.\"</p> <p>Such language is telling of how Grieve is cut from a different cloth to David Cameron. Where Grieve says he applies \"my religious precepts to my life\", Cameron jokes that his faith is like \"the reception for Magic FM in the Chilterns: it sort of comes and goes\".</p> <p>Cameron regarded Grieve as a natural choice because he had never put a foot wrong during the five years as shadow attorney general. Nevertheless, he was surprised by his promotion. A year earlier he nearly resigned in disgust from the frontbench after he was passed off for the new post of shadow justice secretary. This was a deliberate punishment by Cameron after Grieve had challenged an apparent attempt by the leadership to water down Tory support for grammar schools in areas where they have a strong presence. Beaconsfield, his constituency since 1997, lies in Buckinghamshire, where selective education still holds sway.</p> <p>\"I am a huge believer in the system that Buckinghamshire has,\" Grieve says, clarifying who won last year's argument. \"Any change to it would be massively disturbing and lower educational standards.\" Such plain speaking shows that Cameron has something of a free thinker at his top table.</p>",
  "<h2>Terror suspects arrested on board plane in Cologne</h2> <p>German police boarded a KLM flight at Cologne airport yesterday and arrested two men suspected of planning a terrorist attack.

They denied reports that the plane had been stormed by commando forces. They had been trailing the men for months, and had arrested them after finding suicide notes in their Cologne flat saying they were acting in the name of jihad.<br><strong>Kate Connolly in Berlin</strong></p> <h2>Man who abandoned nine children just 'fell apart'</h2> <p>An out-of-work widower who abandoned nine of his children at a hospital under Nebraska's new safe haven law said he was overwhelmed without his wife and just \"fell apart\". \"I hope they know I love them,\" Gary Staton told television station KETV. The unique law allows caregivers to abandon children at hospitals without fear of prosecution. Staton left the five boys and four girls... aged one to 17... at Creighton University Medical Centre's emergency room on Wednesday. He said his wife died shortly after delivering their youngest child, and he could not take care of the children on his own.<br><strong>Associated Press in Nebraska</strong></p> <h2>Police hand driver \u00a31m fine for traffic offences</h2> <p>A businessman in Sao Paulo was pulled over by police at a roadblock on the city's south side and handed a traffic fine for R$3.4m - just over \u00a31m. Armando Clemente da Silva was ordered from his 1996 Corsa, which was impounded. Records show that drivers in the car's 12 year history have racked up 970 fines for speeding and illegal parking.

  "<p>Speaking about the less than surprising revelations at the end of Our Mutual Friend, Charles Dickens made this ruefully exasperated comment: \"I foresaw the likelihood that a class of readers and commentators would suppose that I was at great pains to conceal exactly what I was at great pains to suggest.\" I imagine Benjamin Black (aka John Banville) might have foreseen a similar reaction to his first two mysteries, Christine Falls and The Silver Swan. In each, the solution to the various puzzles facing Quirke, their majestically gloomy protagonist, is fairly obvious, fairly early on, and intentionally so. </p> <p>The point, as in Greek tragedy, isn't to floor the audience with some stunning twist, but to charge the foreknown with powerful meanings that release correspondingly powerful emotions. The disclosures at the end of Christine Falls may not surprise exactly, but through them the force of the book's portrayal of 1950s Dublin, squatted over by an alliance of ruthless businessmen and sleazy clerics, is brought into final, devastating focus. The same goes for The Silver Swan, where the murder plot is less an occasion for clever sleuthing or cliffhanger suspense than the armature for a series of swift, often brilliant sketches of Dublin lowlifes trapped and warped in that decade's (the 50s again) peculiar aspic of boredom and repression. Both books leave one with the sense of a highly skilled literary novelist using the mystery format on his own terms and shaping it to his own purposes.</p> <p>The Lemur, Banville/Black's latest, forsakes the pathologist Quirke and his seedy postwar Dublin for John Glass, a once-celebrated journalist now married to money and idling in a glittering present-day Manhattan. Appointed by his autocratic father-in-law, Bill Mulholland, to write his official biography, Glass hires a researcher, who appears to discover something unsavoury in the old man's past. Before he can pass on this dark secret, however, the researcher is found dead: shot through the eye with a bullet fired from a Beretta - just as a former colleague of Mulholland's was, years earlier . . .</p> <p>It's a slimmer, much slighter book than its predecessors, and in this case it's very much the genre that seems to be shaping the narrative rather than vice versa, with all the contrivance that the convention calls for - false leads, surprise twists, bursts of B-movie dialogue (\"'You look to me,' he said, 'like a man about to cause an awful lot of trouble . . . '\").</p> <p>This would be fine if it were done with conviction, but that seems only intermittently the case. The book was commissioned for serial publication by the New York Times Magazine, which no doubt presented an interesting challenge, but the excitement seems to have worn off quickly in the execution. You can practically hear the author yawning as he bangs out the off-the-peg CIA background for his menacing patriarch (the old judge in Christina Falls is a masterpiece of morally equivocal portraiture by comparison), or the equally thinly imagined crusading career of his burned-out journalist. A measure of the general perfunctoriness is the growing gap between the book's escalating rhetoric of anxiety - \"How had this thing gone wrong, so quickly, so comprehensively?\" - and the reader's actual, rather low level of concern for Glass or anyone else. It's like being hustled by a film score into feeling fears that the drama itself hasn't come close to arousing. </p> <p>The intrigue itself turns on the question of the death of Mulholland's former colleague. Suicide or murder? If the latter, by whom? But since almost nothing is done to interest us in this man's life (his name is Varriker, but it might as well be MacGuffin), it's hard to get caught up in the mystery of his death. And the final twist, far from making the villainy seem suddenly larger and more chilling than you ever imagined (which is what twists are supposed to do - isn't it?), has the perverse effect of diminishing it, bringing matters to a close with a decided whimper. </p> <p>Which is all, quite possibly, to take the book more seriously than it wants to be taken. There's a pervasive flavour of the po-mo lark; winking allusions to David Lynch (\"Mulholland\"), and to Chinatown (John Huston has a walk-on part, as host of the event where Glass first met his wife). There's also enough queasily self-conscious invocation of the generic - \"He was a walking clich\u00e9\", \"a couple of caricature Wall Street brokers, loudly discussing hedge funds\", \"The Police Station . . . looked just as it would have in the movies\" - to suggest the enterprise may think of itself as entirely tongue-in-cheek. Whether that makes it any more interesting will depend on your taste. Certainly the pages go by at a good clip. The descriptive filler is, as you'd expect, mostly of a high quality. And there are some memorable observations - \"The trouble with smoking was that the desire to smoke was so much greater than the satisfaction afforded by actually smoking . . . \" But personally I'd recommend holding tight till the next instalment of the Quirke family saga, which is not only incomparably more gripping, but also, despite its setting, considerably more fresh and original.</p> <p>\u2022 James Lasdun's novel Seven Lies is published by Vintage.

  "<p>Multiculturalism in the UK has left a \"terrible\" legacy, creating a vacuum that has been filled by extremists from across the political spectrum, the shadow home secretary, Dominic Grieve, warns today. </p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian on the eve of the Conservative party conference, Grieve says that \"long-term inhabitants\" have been left fearful, while second- and third- generation immigrants have felt alienated and unsure what British values stand for. He also warns against downplaying Britain's Christian heritage.</p> <p>His remarks on such a contentious area come as an ICM poll for the Guardian shows that Labour has narrowed the gap on the Tories, whose lead over the government is now into single figures - the lowest since April. </p> <p>The survey puts the Conservatives on 41%, down three points from last month. Labour is up three on 32% with the Liberal Democrats on 18%. </p> <p>The poll - the first to be carried out after the end of the Labour conference and the resignation of Ruth Kelly - suggests that voters may be returning to Labour amid fears of a worldwide economic crash, and will underline fears in the Tory party that it has yet to \"seal the deal\" with the electorate. Based on the poll, the Conservatives would struggle to win an overall majority at an immediate general election.</p> <p>With polls now suggesting a narrowing of the gap between the two main parties, David Cameron knows he needs to outline how the Tories would address the economic crisis and make a difference in government. The conference has been tightly organised to focus on the economy, the NHS and \"fixing broken Britain\".</p> <p>But Grieve today ventures into the sensitive subject of multiculturalism in some of the strongest remarks by a Tory in recent times. He tells the Guardian: \"We've actually done something terrible to ourselves in Britain. In the name of trying to prepare people for some new multicultural society we've encouraged people, particularly the sort of long-term inhabitants, to say 'well your cultural background isn't really very important'.\" He adds: \"In this vacuum the BNP rise and Hizb ut-Tahrir rises. They're two very similar phenomena of people who are experiencing a form of cultural despair about themselves, their identity. And it's terribly easy to latch on to confrontational and aggressive variants of their cultural background as being the only way to sort of reassure themselves that they can survive and have an identity.\"</p> <p>The shadow home secretary said multiculturalism was inspired by the \"understandable\" desire to make people feel comfortable. But he added: \"The idea behind it was [to] create the melting pot. But the melting pot needs the ingredients of people's confidence in themselves as they come together. And if it isn't there I think we've done ourselves huge damage.\" </p> <p>He also raises fears that \"fundamental Islam\" is restricting debate. \"Our country has adapted because people have been tolerant which has often required a lot of forbearance and acceptance of things they didn't like. We all have to accept things we don't like. That is how Britain has evolved. When I go and address an Islamic audience I always point this out.\"</p> <p>An Anglican, Grieve praises the contribution all the major religions have made to Britain. But he says that people should not forget Britain's Christian heritage. \"The role of Christianity is really rather important. It can't just be magicked out of the script. It colours many of the fundamental viewpoints of British people, including many who've never been in a church.\"</p> <p>Grieve says he would restore traditional British justice by conducting a review into whether to scrap fixed penalties for \"dishonesty offences\", such as shoplifting, though not motoring offences.</p> <p>\u2022 ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,012 adults aged 18+ by telephone between September 24 and 25. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults.</p>",
  "<p>Irish eyes are smiling on nervous British savers. If you are worried about banks going bust, Irish institutions, such as Bank of Ireland and Anglo Irish Bank - which both operate in the UK - this week became some of the safest places to keep your cash.</p> <p>And that is very good news for anyone who has money in a savings account run by the UK Post Office, which channels funds into Bank of Ireland. The Irish government has decided to beef up the country's \"deposit protection scheme\" (similar to the compensation scheme that protects UK savers) so that it now covers savings up to \u20ac100,000 per person, per bank. That is about \u00a379,000 - more than double the \u00a335,000 protection the UK offers.</p> <p>This is a move that does not just benefit people living on the Emerald Isle. You do not have to be resident in Ireland, or be an Irish citizen, to claim. As long as your money is held in a bank or building society that is part of the scheme, and your account is one of the types covered, you can make a claim.</p> <p>What this means is that if you have, say, \u00a375,000 stashed in an account run by a bank covered by the Irish compensation scheme, and that bank went bust, you would get \u00a375,000 back. If you had \u00a375,000 in a UK-based high street bank, you would only be guaranteed \u00a335,000.</p> <p>Previously, the Irish compensation limit was \u20ac20,000 (\u00a315,800), which meant UK savers with money in accounts run by Irish banks would have had to claim this much in Ireland, topped up to a maximum of \u00a335,000 by the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Now, though, you would go straight to the Irish scheme.</p> <p>The new rules apply to, among others, Bank of Ireland and Anglo Irish Bank, both of which are open for business in the UK.</p> <p>If you are one of the thousands of people who has money in the Post Office's popular Instant Saver account, you may or may not know that this account is provided by Bank of Ireland, as are the Post Office's Growth Bonds and its Fiveyear Saver. Its recently-launched cash Isa, paying 6.25%, is provided by Family Investments, but the deposits are held by Bank of Ireland and so, again, you are covered by the more generous Irish scheme.</p> <p>The new regime is also good news for the 140,000 UK savings customers of Anglo Irish Bank, which launched savings products in this country five years ago and regularly features in the \"best-buy\" tables. Its most attractive offerings include fixed rate bonds paying 7% and the Easy Access Account paying 6.4%. Anglo Irish says the new higher limits are \"great news\" for all its UK savers.</p> <p>The changes may mean that some people with large-ish sums to invest will feel safer with an Irish bank than a UK one. Legislation is being introduced to implement the new \u20ac100,000 limit, but the change will be backdated to September 20.</p> <p>What about other European banks? All countries in the European Economic Area must have a compensation scheme in place, but in most cases these are more stingy than ours. However, most European banks operating here - including players such as ING Direct and Landsbanki (the bank behind Icesave) - have \"topped up\" the protection they offer by joining our scheme, too, which means you would end up being entitled to up to \u00a335,000.</p> <p>Brits enviously eyeing the gold-plated Irish scheme should not be downhearted. There are proposals to raise the UK compensation limit to \u00a350,000, which would apparently cover 98% of savers, and it has been suggested that this change could be made quite soon.</p> <p>In the meantime, if you have got a fair bit of cash, spread your savings around a number of different institutions. And check who owns the bank or runs its savings operation, because in some cases people could be left out of pocket if they have their money in two or more savings providers that happen to be part of the same banking group, and this then went bust.</p> <p>This can get complicated:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Six HBOS-owned or run savings providers - Halifax, Bank of Scotland, Birmingham Midshires, Intelligent Finance, Saga and the AA - all share the same Financial Services Authority \"authorisation\", which means anyone with money in two or more of these would, in the event of HBOS going belly-up, only get one helping of the \u00a335,000 compensation. But Sainsbury's Bank, a joint venture between HBOS and Sainsbury's, has its own authorisation.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland, Tesco Personal Finance (a joint venture with the supermarket giant) and Coutts are all part of the Royal Bank of Scotland group, but each one is separately authorised. However, Direct Line - another part of the group - shares its authorisation with RBS.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Lloyds TSB and HBOS currently have separate authorisations, though it is unclear what will happen once the HBOS takeover by Lloyds TSB has taken effect.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Alliance &amp; Leicester is being taken over by Spanish bank Santander, which owns Abbey, though it looks like the two UK banks will retain separate authorisations. However, Abbey's online bank Cahoot shares Abbey's authorisation.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Derbyshire and Cheshire building societies are being taken over by the Nationwide in December, and they will then share the bigger society's authorisation.<br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/interactive/2008/sep/25/savings.providers\"><br>Are your savings institutions part of the same banking group?</a></p>",
  "<h2>I have strayed from my degree, how can I re-engineer my career?</h2> <p>I graduated in 2002 with a first class BEng in mechanical engineering. I didn't become an engineer and now, six years later, I wish I had and am wondering if it's too late. I decided at the time that I didn't want to be an engineer per se but that I'd like to apply my knowledge in some form. I applied for many jobs (graduate trainees for patent law firms, technical publishing, process engineering in the oil industry) and had a few interviews. For whatever reason, I never progressed further. I found it hard to focus on a specific role that interested me and realised I'd been lulled into a false sense of security as to how easy it would be to find a job. </p> <p>As a result, I worked in a small printers for nearly a year until I accidentally found a place on the graduate training scheme for a global PR agency in London. I didn't know what PR was but the job was as a trainee in the agency's technology practice. This seemed to fit my desire for something related to my degree with an element of creativity. </p> <p>I soon realised it wasn't for me - the work was repetitive, not challenging and I didn't fit the role. However, it taught me a lot of valuable lessons. My next job was in communications for a global engineering firm. I enjoyed the role for several years but began to feel pangs of regret for not being on the other side, as an engineer. I began to find out more about all the different roles and what I could have done. Ironically, now that I was in an engineering firm but NOT as an engineer, I began to see the possibilities. I also began to think about travelling, which I hadn't done much of to date. </p> <p>As a result, I moved to Mallorca, Spain and am working as a freelance copywriter. I am again feeling unchallenged and want to make a change. I am passionate about the environment and would love to explore further study, building upon my engineering knowledge, or find work where I can apply my degree - something where I can be of use to society. Is it too late for me to use my degree? Six years is a long time and I really don't remember much of the nitty-gritty of the theory. I enjoyed many elements of the course; most notably the mathematics, materials engineering and fluid mechanics. Money is still an issue, but my work now allows flexibility to earn around studying. Is it too long since I graduated to apply for training courses? Which is the best option and which is more open to me? Study or work? If only I'd known in 2002 what I know now.</p> <p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> There seems to be a sizeable category of people who see the obtaining of a degree not as the necessary introduction to a professional career but as an end in itself; as a self-contained project. It's almost as if the gaining of a degree is just a natural, if rather more challenging, successor to the holiday essay.</p> <p>It sounds to me as if you belong to this category. Otherwise I find it odd that you should have chosen to take a degree in mechanical engineering, worked diligently enough to obtain a first - and then decided not to be an engineer. It's true that a good degree in just about any subject should reassure prospective employers in all sectors that you're both intelligent and conscientious - but it's certainly not a guaranteed passport to utterly unrelated jobs.</p> <p>All this, of course, you now know - and I'm sorry to spell it out so starkly. But I think it's a necessary preamble to working out where you might go next. </p> <p>You've learned a great deal in the last six years and you shouldn't see them as wasted (though I'm a bit bewildered by your sudden swerve to live in Mallorca and take up freelance copywriting: that does seem a bit of an aberration).</p> <p>What you've finally learned (I think) is what you're passionately interested in - and it's not engineering. It's the endlessly fascinating and vastly important subject of the environment. So now you must feed that fascination - and you're surprisingly well-equipped to do so. You have a trained mind that can understand mathematical models and scientific data - and you also have considerable experience of communication. That's a rare combination. I don't think you need further study - I think you should go hell-bent for work. If you can do it from Spain, fine. If not, you'll have to come home. Be utterly relentless in your pursuit of any sniff of an opportunity to work in the environmental field. Don't worry too much initially about money and prospects: start at the bottom and learn on the job. But for the first time in your life you'll be doing something that you're not only intellectually qualified to do but are actually passionate about. And that means you have every chance of doing it extremely well. </p> <h2>I have a good CV, so why am I not getting any interviews?</h2> <p>I have been applying for PA jobs for a year. I have come from a creative and retail background but have improved my Microsoft skills by taking advanced courses. I feel my CV is in good shape yet have only had one interview for a PA role despite applying for jobs nearly every day for the past 12 months. What am I doing wrong? Why am I being ignored?</p> <p><strong> Jeremy:</strong> It could be just chance - it often is. But it's possible that your all-purpose CV, though perfectly professional, doesn't let your own individuality shine through enough. Rather than send off dozens of identical applications in the hope that one of them will strike gold, it's worth giving a lot of thought to each of the companies you're applying to - and then modifying your CV accordingly. Your creative and retail experience and your own out-of-work interests, for example, will be of potential interest to some but not to others. Doing it this way is a lot more time-consuming, certainly: but it should greatly improve your chances of getting to interview stage.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> For Jeremy Bullmore's advice on a work issue, send a brief email to <a href=\"mailto:work@theguardian.com\">work@theguardian.com</a>.

  "<p>A residential care home for the elderly, for many of us, will be the departure lounge, the last place we can be fully, socially human before becoming a chart at the end of the bed.</p> <p>Some half a million elderly and physically disabled people are long-term residents of about 30,000 private, public and voluntary care homes in the UK. Yet unlike the hospital - another place you'd rather not be if you can help it - the care home is almost invisible in our culture, despite a collective population equivalent to Newcastle and Gateshead combined. One might almost wonder if there's a nationwide conspiracy of uncomfortable silence, like a guilty family secret. Sian Lowell, a veteran care home worker who three months ago started as a shift manager at Hawthorn Court, a private residential care home up the winding hills of Swansea, hints as much.</p> <p>\"I've noticed more pressure from families, a huge amount of guilt among relatives; you can see that if they become aggressive towards you,\" she says. \"Today, men and women work all the time but have an emotional attachment to the idea we should be the ones looking after our elderly relatives. I try to recognise the turmoil that creates in relatives who show it by being very demanding. If my mother was still alive and in a care home, I would want the best for her too.\"</p> <p>Lowell is starting her 2-10pm shift with the handover period, a debrief with the morning shift manager, Bev. Nestling in what was originally an Edwardian villa which since has sprouted annexe after annexe, leaving sadly little garden space, their office is a den of peeling cream-painted walls, shelves of files, a noticeboard pinned with official certification and need-to-know paperwork, a forbiddingly steel-doored medication cupboard and four CCTV screens monitoring the exits for intruders. A new young care worker, Sarah, brings us tea, and residents feel free to pop their head round the door to say hello. Hawthorn Court is a pleasant place where people potter about, watch TV and chat over glasses of squash (ready to hand to prevent urine infections, a common care home problem).</p> <p>Among Hawthorn Court's 26 residents aged from 80 to 98, one in particular is a recent cause of concern to Lowell and her team. \"One lady has now developed dementia, and she will spend all day walking and picking things up, and has had several accidents through sheer exhaustion. You endeavour to secure her safety but you can't watch her 24 hours a day. She used to run two shops, and I think in her mind she's stacking shelves or tidying up. So you have to monitor her. She was dehydrated and is diabetic and also on psychiatric medication, so I spoke to her CPN (community psychiatric nurse); he came up and assessed her, checked her blood pressure, looked at her fluid chart and the confidential documentation we'd written on her behaviour - something as simple as someone waking up in the middle of the night might be significant. None of us are nurses or doctors; we have them to plug in to.\"</p> <p>Lowell is part of a healthcare network that extends from GPs to incontinence advisers, CPNs, consultant psychiatrists and psychologists: \"We have to liaise with somebody almost every day, and work as a team within a big outer team.\" Then, of course, there are the cooks and cleaners, and her care staff which number three per shift with an occasional trainee as well. Lowell has a lot on her shoulders.</p> <p>\"I worked for years in Swansea social services; I got the training and perspective, but it was clinical, so being back at a private residential home is lovely. You adhere to the same procedures, but because it's smaller, it's friendlier. In the bigger social services homes you spend half the day writing up the changing policies - which I still do here, but residents can pop in and out of the office and we all muck in together. We try to make things as much as we can like a family home. Some residents like to go into the kitchens to help wash up, using their household skills; some like to play the piano, or go out to eat.\"</p> <p>Originally from Kidderminster, Lowell married young and, when her husband lost his job as recession hit the carpet industry, moved with her young children to her mother's home town, Swansea, \"to start afresh. When I left school at 16 I worked in a local youth club, then an adventure park in a very rough neighbourhood to help get the youth off the street. I started working in a care home aged 22, my first ever job in Swansea. Right then I just knew I wanted to help people. Don't ask me why - I just knew.\"</p> <p>In her home life, Lowell, now 44, has had to care too; her mother died of cancer aged 62 and her father of cirrhosis aged 56. \"I experienced loss, and I think I care so much because I have no older family left. It wasn't a good marriage and I'm divorced; I have three wonderful daughters, but it's just us.\" Lowell's youngest is still at school but her middle daughter, aged 18 who has just qualified as a hairdresser, is making her a grandmother at the end of the year. They all rub along together in Lowell's four-bedroom house.</p> <p>Today, Lowell's proudest possessions are not material; they are her qualifications, crucially an NVQ advisory level 3 as required under the Care Standards Act passed eight years ago. NVQs in care work can't just be acquired by passing a written exam: training, observations, case studies, work placements and witness testimonies are all part of the nine-module mix. It can take two years to pass, \"though some people fly through it in three months. By law throughout Wales we have to go on POVA courses - Protection of Vulnerable Adults - have CRB [Criminal Record Bureau] checks, and work to a minimum NVQ level 2. And when I worked on an EMI - the elderly and mentally infirm - unit, I did university death and dying courses.</p> <p>\"In this home we have no specialised units, though a lot of our residents have gone on to develop dementia or Alzheimer's. But this is their home, and as long as they do not require high-dependency nursing care, they remain here at home.\"</p> <p>With all that on her plate, does Lowell still have the time and energy to care?</p> <p>\"I have a rule for myself which I tell the trainees: treat people how you'd want to be treated yourself in the same situation. If you live by that, you can't go wrong.\"</p> <p>It is, she admits, not always easy for a young trainee to empathise with someone 60 years older. \"That's why it takes a special person to do this. People should not just do this as a job. You get some young carers who just don't realise what the work entails. Personal care - washing, bathing, showering, toileting, dealing with incontinence pads and urine and faeces - is quite shocking to some people.\"</p> <p>But, says Lowell, you can care too much.</p> <p>\"A few years ago I was a key worker to a lady who had Alzheimer's. To see this vibrant, intelligent woman, a headmistress who travelled the world and did dramatics, at the age of only 58 diagnosed with Alzheimer's was so painful. I saw her through to the very end, when she'd even forgotten how to swallow. I felt I knew her and I got a little too attached. But sometimes it's almost impossible not to. Now, I try to remain professional but also I hope I'm friendly and approachable too.\"</p> <p>Lowell's ambitions? To do her residence managers award, and leadership and management skills qualification. \"Twenty years ago it was just a job. I want a career; I want to run my own home or be a manager for an owner. I want to be able to instil my values and training, and encourage other people to do theirs. The whole perspective of what you might say are menial jobs is changing; it can now be a career with status.\"</p> <h2>Curriculum vitae</h2> <p><strong>Pay</strong> \u00a36.50 per hour and a performance-linked pay review, plus four weeks' paid holiday.</p> <p><strong>Hours</strong> Four eight-hour shifts a week, but up to a 40-hours a week when covering other staff.</p> <p><strong>Highs</strong> \"Little things like seeing a new member of staff pleased with her training, or making a resident's day by making a tray of tea if their family is visiting. If I see they're happy, that gives me gratification.\"</p> <p><strong>Lows</strong> \"It's tiring, and witnessing people feeling loss is painful. And it's sometimes frustrating and heartbreaking when you can't help somebody.\"</p>",
  "<p>There are few outward signs that Tim Lindsay isn't completely straight. A family man in his fifties and president of advertising giant TBWA, with a client list of international brands that include Apple, Adidas, Mars, McDonald's and PlayStation, Lindsay appears to be a highly successful, even conventional, senior manager.</p> <p>Yet Lindsay has a secret. According to an aptitude test designed by the advertising industry to pull it out of its white, middle-class rut, Lindsay is, to date, the most \"diagonal thinker\" in the world.</p> <p>You may have heard of linear thought - the ability to think logically. And you're probably aware of lateral thinking - the ability to think creatively. But diagonal thinking is a new concept dreamed up by the advertising business to describe the combination of the linear and lateral thinking needed to succeed in creative jobs.</p> <p>\"It's the ability to switch effortlessly between linear, logical thought processes to lateral, creative ones,\" explains Hamish Pringle, director general of advertising trade body the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising (IPA), \"and it seems to be one of the defining characteristics of people who do well in our industry. If you're just linear, you should, perhaps, be an accountant. Just lateral and maybe you should be in fine arts. But if you're a diagonal thinker, you are equipped to succeed in all the main roles in advertising.\"</p> <p>According to the IPA 10% of the population can think diagonally. If you're curious to find out if you're a diagonal thinker - or keen to land a creative job - try taking the IPA's free hour-long, online aptitude test. \"Anyone scoring more than 90% can print out an IPA certificate proving their scores and attach it to their CV,\" says Pringle. Proof of talent will become, he reckons, \"their passport to Adland\". </p> <p>The test has been endorsed by the government which included it in a Creative Britain strategy document published earlier this year and was officially launched last week by culture secretary, Andy Burnham, at a festival held in London's Golden Square to promote the creative industries.</p> <p>With the financial sector in crisis, the government sees the creative industries as key to Britain's future economic success. Currently accounting for more than 7% of GDP, the creative sector is growing at twice the rate of the wider economy and is on course to become the second largest contributor to the UK economy by 2018. </p> <p>And yet it's an industry perceived as being riddled with institutional snobbery and elitism. Pringle admits that \"diagonal thinking\" is only the latest effort by creative industries desperate to shed their reputation as a refuge for the pampered bourgeoisie.</p> <p>\"There's a self-reinforcing cycle of largely white, middle class, university-educated students who are friends and family of similar people already employed throughout the top levels of the industry,\" he says. \"They're the ones who get the scarce work experience positions, receive coaching on completing job applications and the interview process, and end up winning one of the rare jobs on offer.\"</p> <p>Sure enough, a recent IPA survey found that only 6% of advertising people come from ethnic backgrounds - not so bad compared with the national average of 8%, but pretty shocking when compared with the London figure of 40%.</p> <p>It doesn't help that agencies perpetuate the practice of wageless work placements and low entry-level salaries - an average of \u00a317,000 per annum compared with \u00a330,000 you might earn in a law firm, making it nigh impossible for graduate trainees with student debts to afford to live in London without family support. \"If you're not already in our 'village', and from a non-white, non-graduate, non-middle class background, it's very hard to break in,\" concedes Pringle, \"and the lack of role models makes it look as if Adland doesn't want you anyway.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile Lindsay expresses surprise at being the highest-scoring diagonal thinker among the 200 people who have trialled the test. \"I've always known I have both linear and lateral thinking skills, but always thought I was never quite good enough at either,\" he says.</p> <p>But he reckons that it confirms what he has long looked for when recruiting fresh blood. \"I always ask them about their enthusiasms - whether they read the FT and the Economist,\" says Lindsay. \"But I also ask them who their favourite directors are and why.</p> <p>\"You need diagonal thinking in advertising to be able to come up with relevant creative ideas and innovative business ideas, and secondly to be able to judge creative ideas. But most of all you need it to manage creative types - often borderline sociopaths who just don't play by the rules.\"</p> <p>The test has only been available for a few days, but the trials have already produced results. In 2001 Lucia Hargasova came to the UK from Slovakia where her father was a builder. After a couple of years of nannying she was sufficiently fluent in English to put herself through a degree at London Metropolitan University. She took part in the diagonal thinking trials before she graduated this year and, to her surprise, scored in the top 10%. It helped her secure four job interviews and she is now a trainee media planner for media agency Starcom. </p> <p>\"It was straightforward. Time pressured, but not difficult,\" she recalls. \"But there's no doubt that my test results opened doors for me that might otherwise have remained closed.\"</p> <h2>How to do the diagonal thinking test</h2> <p>The diagonal thinking test is a cocktail of psychometric measures which identify the linear and lateral thinking styles, and personality traits that have been proven to be characteristic of people who do well in the advertising business, explains the occupational psychologist John Gage who developed the test. Try answering the following:</p> <p><strong>Lateral thinking question</strong><br>You are managing director of a small but successful catalogue clothing business aimed at professional people within the UK with above average incomes. Your clothing is priced generally around 80% higher than your nearest competitor, but sells well to its market as it is seen as unique in design, high quality and British made. You are deciding whether to expand your target market or to re-brand to make your business even bigger and better.</p> <p>List as many factors and issues you would need to take into account making this decision.</p> <p><strong>Linear thinking question</strong><br>Should all British householders be fined for failing to recycle at least 70% of their household waste?</p> <p>Questions like this measure your ability to judge whether an argument is a good or poor one in relation to the question presented. A good one would be important and related to the question, while a bad one would be if it is of minor importance or related only to trivial aspects of the question. For example, a poor argument might be \"No - fining schemes usually backfire as people often rebel against them. It should be up to each individual household to decide on the amount of waste they wish to recycle.\" In contrast, a good argument might be: \"Yes - this would encourage the average British citizen to think more about their recycling habits.\" </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ipa.co.uk\">ipa.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/ofcom\">Ofcom</a> right to say that we face a real problem with public service broadcasting? Yes. You can't look at the depressing conclusions about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/ITV\">ITV</a>'s regional provision, contained in the regulator's report this week, without accepting that. And is Andy Burnham, the culture secretary, right to say that it's an urgent problem? Again my answer is yes. The ITV story offers a grim lesson. Over the years, successive regulators moved too slowly and underestimated the scale of change that ITV was facing. There may be an inevitability about ITV's retrenchment now, but the public have every right to feel let down.</p> <p>So, a real and urgent set of issues. But does that mean that Ofcom's ever smaller set of proposed funding models somehow hold between them the way ahead for British broadcasting? </p> <p>I don't believe so. To me, the debate needs to become more ambitious, more imaginative and less defeatist. We need a solution that supports the vital creative and editorial role which Channel 4 plays in our system. But we shouldn't throw in the towel when it comes to ITV and Channel Five - both have a critical role to play in investment, in creative diversity and in public service delivery. The public wants all to remain in the family. And they don't want the stabilisation of any of the commercially funded public service broadcasters at the price of destabilising or weakening the BBC. </p> <p>Long-range certainty of funding and independence for public service broadcasting must include long-range certainty of funding and independence for the BBC. Otherwise you haven't strengthened the system at all: you've just moved the problem elsewhere.</p> <p>Britain's broadcasters need to do more together to shape their own destiny, and the BBC can and must play a central role in this. We're well down the road to a set of tangible and economically significant initiatives to help all of the public service broadcasters transition successfully to a digital future. Can our investment and the lessons we're learning about digital production transform the whole industry? Can we help small, independent producers and other stakeholders and potential partners as well as public service broadcasters? Can we use regional and journalistic infrastructure to help the sustainability of local, regional and national services beyond the BBC?</p> <p>Later in the year, we will be presenting our ideas to the BBC Trust. We know they've got to represent more than just fine words. They've got to mean real, identifiable cost savings and new revenue streams and they've got to be deliverable. They've got to work for Channel 4, for ITV, for Five. Indeed, many of the ideas we're developing at the moment don't come from us, they come from the other public service broadcasters.</p> <p>I want to offer a set of practical partnerships and initiatives which are deliverable and big enough to be game-changing. Which do not require legislation or any new regulatory machinery - and which, therefore, can make an economic difference to the other broadcasters in months rather than years. Which avoid going around the houses yet again on the tired and contentious topics of contestability and an \"Arts Council of the air\". And which point to broadcasting's future rather than its past.</p> <p>We need a better debate about the future of public service broadcasting. Less spin. Less certainty that the regulatory levers are the only levers to achieve the right result. Less sitting back and waiting for the politicians or somebody else to ride to the rescue. We need to work together to give this unique, sometimes slightly wayward, ultimately very precious system of ours a great future. It's what the public want. This time we shouldn't let them down. </p> <p>\u2022 Mark Thompson is director general of the BBC.

  "<p>Lewis Hamilton showcased his confident mastery of Singapore's spectacular Marina Bay street circuit yesterday by posting the fastest time during the opening day's practice for formula one's first race to be run at night under floodlights. The McLaren-Mercedes driver shaved every retaining wall with relentless precision to set a time less than one-tenth of a second faster than Felipe Massa's Ferrari, his main rival in the ongoing battle for the 2008 world championship.</p> <p>The Brazilian was lucky to escape contact with the barriers close to the circuit edge after skidding up escape roads on a couple of occasions. Hamilton said that the circuit was one of the most physically demanding he had experienced, rating it twice as difficult as Monaco where he won earlier this year.</p> <p>\"You need to put a lot of work into the car to get a good lap,\" he said. \"I'd say it requires double the energy of Monaco over a single lap. One lap around here is like two laps of Monaco.\" While insisting that the lights were not a distraction, he added: \"I was surprised how bumpy certain sections of the track are. Through certain corners there was lots of bottoming, and when you hit a bump it would throw the car around quite a bit.</p> <p>\"On my first proper run, I managed to find a half-decent line - but the car was still bottoming in places. Throughout P1 [the first session] I was able to get more comfortable with the car. On first impressions, there seems to be quite a lot of grip on the track, so you can brake quite late into the slower corners.\"</p> <p>Hamilton's impressive demonstration marked the start of a new era in the sport's history as the most sophisticated racing cars took to the track for this bold new experiment, the intensity of the trackside illumination offering a dramatic, if slightly surreal, counterpoint to the twinkling lights of the skyscrapers on the horizon in the city centre a couple of miles away in the inky blackness.</p> <p>Fernando Alonso caused something of a surprise by setting the fastest time in the second session with his Renault R28 but he was one-tenth of a second shy of the times set by Hamilton and Massa in the first session. </p> <p>Toro Rosso's Sebastian Vettel, winner of the previous race at Monza, was 1.7 seconds off the pace and predicted a weekend of struggle for his team. \"The track is very difficult and unfortunately the surface is very bumpy which does not make life easy,\" Vettel said. \"As for my car, I'm not happy yet as it feels very loose and I don't think we will have an easy time.\"</p> <p>The new circuit was obviously very dusty and slippery from the outset, a fact discovered abruptly by Mark Webber, who skidded into a wall within a few minutes of the start of the first session, removing his Red Bull's right front wheel in the impact. \"Crashing on your third lap is probably not the best way to prepare for a race weekend,\" said the team principal Christian Horner.</p> <p>Webber's car was repaired in time for him to compete in the second session, although he only took to the track half an hour after it began and ended up setting the 11th-fastest time. Hamilton's teammate, Heikki Kovalainen, finished the day fourth fastest ahead of Kimi Raikkonen in the other Ferrari while Robert Kubica, currently third in the world championship, wound up sixth in his BMW Sauber.</p> <p>Jarno Trulli certainly will not forget his first experience of the 3.148-mile track, finishing the day with a reprimand from the race stewards and a \u20ac10,000 (\u00a37,950) fine for driving in the wrong direction. The Italian lost control of his Toyota TF108 at the exit of the final left-hander before the pits, skidding to a juddering halt in the middle of the circuit.</p> <p>Instead of spin-turning his car back into the direction of the circuit, Trulli astonished onlookers by committing the cardinal sin of driving against the traffic in order to gain access to the pit lane. </p> <p>The stewards were understandably shocked by such a fundamental driving breach on the part of a seasoned competitor and Trulli also received an official reprimand for this lapse in etiquette. Most people felt he was lucky to get away so lightly.</p> <p>There were concerns voiced about the configuration of the entrance to and exit from the pit lane which may require addressing before today's qualifying session. \"We might need to move the pit lane entry a bit - with the white line filtering us in there's going to be quite a speed differential between the guys coming in and the guys still on the track,\" said Webber.</p> <p>The problem was highlighted by a close moment when Sebastien Bourdais exited the pit lane just as Nick Heidfeld committed to the first turn on a flying lap, causing the Toro Rosso to cut across the inside run-off and the German driver's BMW Sauber to take to the run-off area on the opposite side of the track.</p>",
  "<p>Jonny Wilkinson passed another milestone when he became the Premiership's all-time record points-scorer as he steered Newcastle to an important win over Bristol at Kingston Park. Wilkinson had a hand in both Newcastle's tries but he also converted both and kicked a penalty to take his Premiership points total to 1,482, two ahead of Andy Goode.</p> <p>Billed as the battle of the basement clubs, the match was no great shakes but both sides tried to play attacking rugby on a greasy pitch, although it did degenerate into a kicking match after some fussy refereeing from Chris White.</p> <p>Wilkinson kicked two conversions and a penalty as Newcastle's pack edged Bristol's but they were never able to control a lively Bristol backline and their director of rugby, Steve Bates, said: \"When Jonny kicked that conversion from the touchline in the second half it was just what we needed.</p> <p>\"It gave the team a big lift but that's what you get with Jonny. It's quite amazing that he has set the record for points-scoring in the Premiership considering how much rugby he has missed.</p> <p>\"We're very pleased with the result although we did make a few errors and we now go to Gloucester with confidence. We will keep our feet on the floor because, while it was a good performance, it wasn't a vintage performance.\"</p> <p>Bristol's head coach, Richard Hill, also paid tribute to Wilkinson when he said: \"There's no one like Jonny when he's playing behind a pack going forward.</p> <p>\"We contributed to our own downfall by making far too many mistakes. I can't put my finger on why that happened and I'm at a bit of a loss, really, after we played so well last week.\"</p> <p>Hill was right. The Falcons pack took control in the first half after Ed Barnes kicked a third-minute penalty and Wilkinson levelled the scores in the eighth minute. The first try was crucial, Adam Balding squeezing over and Wilkinson converting to make it 10-3 in the 23rd minute.</p> <p>Newcastle just about deserved their lead and after the interval Wilkinson did his best to spark the game into life with a couple of mazy runs. This worked as the Falcons went up a gear and Wilkinson and Tom May carved a way through, with John Rudd crashing over in the corner for Wilkinson to convert from the touchline to become the top Premiership points- scorer of all time and ensure Newcastle ran out winners. </p> <p><strong>Newcastle</strong> S Jones, T Visser, J Noon, T May, J Rudd (S Davey 62), J Wilkinson, J Grindal (H Charlton 66), J McDonnell (M Ward 55), M Thompson (A Long 51), C Hayman, A Perry (T Swinson 62), M Sorenson, A Balding (R Winter 64), E Williamson, P Dowson (capt).

  "<p>Was there ever such a pretty wart? There it sits beside the noble nose, the solitary imperfection in Avedon's impossibly beautiful 2004 portrait of Barack Obama, when Obama was the wunderkind of the struggling Democrats. You look at the clever, artless, eager child preserved in the star orator, civic gravity and American ardour overlaid on the same face, the open collar an advertisement of moral transparency, and two wistful thoughts come to mind. How long ago that seems; and how sad it is that the greatest of America's portraitists in any medium isn't around to fulfil his project of shooting \"Democracy\" in action. Avedon died, aged 81, in mid-shoot, not long after photographing Obama. </p> <p>Avedon never made any pretence to objectivity; the notion of the dispassionate lens he wrote off as delusion. His work, he said, was at least as much about him as his subjects: a vast collective self-portrait of the compulsions he projected on to America's faces and figures. In person, he was a merrily humane optimist, warm-blooded and gregarious; to know him was to love him. But he was no sentimentalist and there was a Daumier streak in him: coolly contemptuous of the political masquerade even while enthralled by its performances. Like a caricaturist, he thought that lies and cruelty settled like a crust on the physiognomy. All he had to do was to supply a lit exposure of the particular features in which moral intelligence or its absence had been inscribed.</p> <p>As hip as he mostly was, Avedon was, at root, an old-style Jewish moralist whose texts were written in freckles and furrows, pits and pocks. Sometimes those marks and blemishes, which stood out so sharply in front of the white sheet against which his subjects posed, were lit as poetic expressions of the persona. Avedon took delight in tweaking - or annihilating - the expected icon. Ronald Reagan, whose beaming smile warmed millions with its avuncular easiness, he trapped in lower-facial corrugation, as if the firming of power had been withdrawn in retirement along with the presidential motorcade. \"Looking good,\" Nancy is said to have murmured as Reagan stood, looking anything but, on the chalk lines he had asked Avedon to supply. Avedon may have wanted the gaze off yonder to suggest rueful reflection, but our retrospective knowledge of Reagan's fade into Alzheimer's gives the image a different charge. Confronted by his famously affable beam turned into a mask of porky smugness, as if fattened at the trough of self-satisfaction, Karl Rove got all steamed up, accusing Avedon of setting him up to look \"stupid\"; the arch-amBusher ambushed. To which, I think, Avedon would have replied - with his most rogueishly winning grin - that all his portraits were collaborations; and that nothing about the meeting of photographer and subject was calculated in advance. People came as they were. </p> <p>But the truth is a little more complicated than that profession of guilelessness. Avedon did, in fact, have certain id\u00e9es fixes about the essential whomever; and then, through some astonishing act of photographic magic against that white paper, could make clothes, expression, collude in imprinting the essential them. Merely by the innocent act of sticking his left hand in his pocket, the trademark glasses a smidgin off-kilter, Henry Kissinger's expression assumes the defensiveness of concrete berms erected around a US embassy. For all we know, there may have been moments when Kissinger (who can be voluble) let down his guard and surrendered to the Avedon charm offensive. But the image is of someone guarding state secrets deep in his trousers. Equally, it's hard not to let what we know of Donald Rumsfeld's years of catastrophic military bungling cloud our take on Avedon's young myrmidon of the Ford administration. But the insignia of the Organisation Man, whose openings are strictly limited - the slightly superior amusement registered in the narrowing eyes, the dangerous haircut and the barely unzipped attache case - are already there.</p> <p>Avedon's was a literary and dramatic sensibility more than an aesthetic. Every face, every body, came with a potential narrative to tease out. Sometimes, in his own mind, sitters were twinned in some deep and weighty history even when they faced the camera alone. The Carter-Ford election was fought all over again in his studio; Carter, at ease in his loosely-fitting Christian simplicity, Ford (slightly unfairly) made to scowl as if a different and nicer man were struggling to break through the stony carapace. Deeper still is the duet of Adlai Stevenson and Dwight Eisenhower, a chapter to itself, in Avedon's visualisation, of postwar US history. The curriculum vitae tells us that Stevenson, the last heavyweight intellectual in Democratic politics before the Arkansas Kid, was twice loser; Ike the winner - which sets up expectations of Avedonian role reversal. Stevenson, photographed when he was Kennedy's ambassador to the United Nations, at the acme of his rhetorical force (especially deployed against the Castro-Khruschev missiles), looks to his right, but his face is alive with confident wit; the unembarrassed pleasure of a life fulfilled. The old boy is blessed with the benison of Camelot. By contrast, post-presidential Ike seems flaky pastry; the eyes unfocused. Stevenson's glance is sideways and down, a man on top of his form; Ike's is distant and upward, lost in meditation. But it was Eisenhower who, in his old age, had the more important things to say: his farewell presidential address the famous warning against the coming of the self-perpetuating \"military-industrial complex\", the beast that would consume American liberty. So Avedon bestows on him the dreamy saintliness of an ancient buddha mourning his vindication. </p> <p>The studio was Avedon's theatre, with sitters encouraged to perform and the maestro as the genial director. The only time I went there - for a group photo of New Yorker writers paying homage to their departing editor - the atmosphere was festive, beckoning drinks on a side table. Avedon orchestrated the afternoon unwinding, encouraging us into showtime exuberance (in our case not a challenge). When the right moment came, he stood beside, not behind, the large-format camera, never taking his eyes off us, a party to the party, and caught the family jubilation just so. It was his Shakespearean sense of life as play that made him Olympian and intimate. His strongest pictures tease out the inner, optimised image we all carry within ourselves, hoping that it might have some relationship to the way others see us: strong, wise, finely featured. But then Avedon puts that naively glamourised version in a dialogue with what he sees himself; the result being, in the subjects with which he had most sympathy, a marvellous dialogue between inner and outward countenance: the anima and its vital casing. </p> <p>The effect is to evoke presence more distinctively than any other photographer who has ever turned their hand to portraiture; more powerfully than Matthew Brady, Julia Margaret Cameron, August Sander or Alfred Stieglitz. For, like Rembrandt, Avedon caught the shorthand signature of an entire life, and the pose became a print of individual spirit. </p> <p>\u2022 Avedon's portraits are on show at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington DC, until January 25 2009.

  "<p>Another day, another big American bank goes under. Yesterday, it was <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/mergersNews/idUSN2519733720080926\">Washington Mutual</a>, with $307bn in (somewhat impaired) assets, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/26/business/26wamu.html\">described</a> as \"the biggest bank failure in history\". <br> But that wasn't the biggest story of the day. That of course was the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/26/business/26bailout.html\">collapse of the bail-out negotiations</a> in Washington DC. George Bush invited congressional leaders, along with John McCain and Barack Obama, to sit down and hopefully announce an agreement on a bail-out package. John McCain, who had flown in so he could be on hand to seal the deal, sat silent as GOP dissidents blew the whole thing up.<br> The bail-out package on the table yesterday was a significant improvement over those of the Treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, whose <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/business/21draftcnd.html\">original proposal</a> included no oversight, no controls and no new regulatory requirements for the banks lining up for the proposed $700bn in spending authority - roughly five per cent of annual US national output. That is more than the current budget for defence, or for Social Security benefits, or for Medicare and Medicaid combined.<br> The agreement that got shot down yesterday is a big advance over the blank cheque first proposed, starting with an equity stake for the government, as was arranged with AIG. You want our capital? Fine, we own you. This leads logically to the issue of executive pay. Americans are rightly aghast at the prospect of bailing out chief executives who have amassed fortunes while driving the financial system into crisis. Limiting executive pay is easily accomplished if the government takes an equity stake, as is now contemplated. The agreement as it stood yesterday would institute much more control over dispensing the $700bn, which was originally proposed to be left entirely to Paulson's discretion. These provisions made an admittedly distasteful bailout a little easier to swallow. This is the deal that unraveled before George Bush's eyes yesterday. The Republican conservatives didn't so much <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSTRE48O9WP20080925\">offer a plan</a> as a set of talking points. They asserted that \"private capital can be drawn into the market by removing regulatory and tax barriers.\" All we have to do is relax the regulations and give the banks more tax breaks and losses from impaired assets will somehow turn back into gains. <br> Meanwhile, it was off again, on again for the McCain campaign. After declaring that he would <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/25/AR2008092504603.html\">skip tonight's debate</a> to stay in Washington to deal with the crisis, McCain finally relented and said he will be <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/26/AR2008092601944.html\">on stage tonight</a> for the first debate. <br> Since the beginning of last week, John McCain has declared that the economy's fundamentals are sound, said that as president he would fire SEC member Christopher Cox when he couldn't, repeated his assertion that markets don't need more regulatory oversight, agreed that the bailout requires more oversight, returned to the idea of diverting Social Security funds into private investment accounts, issued a joint statement on the bailout with Barack Obama, announced he was suspending campaigning until further notice and would skip the first debate, sat in a meeting in which the deal over the bailout fell apart, and today decided he would attend the debate after all. No wonder he's looking tired.</p>",
  "<p>In a post this morning, I promised more to come on the question of how this bailout debate exposes a fraying of the longstanding Main Street-Wall Street alliance inside the GOP. So here we go.</p> <p>Let me first explain what that is. \"Main Street\" means, in short, the right-wing populist aspects of the current GOP--guns, God and gays, abortion, rallying the decent common folk against the coastal elites, etc. \"Wall Street\" means, literally, Wall Street -- more specifically, the pro-corporatist policies that the party puts in place once voted into office by the people on Main Street: the tax cuts for the wealthy, the stern opposition to almost all regulation and oversight of the private sector, the denial of a human role in climate change (because to acknowledge would imply the need to do something about it, and that means regulations and oversight), a host of policies like that. </p> <p>Get the little people to vote you in. Give them a small tax cut and lots of symbolic stuff that has no actual price tage. Give the store to the big people. That's the Main Street-Wall Street alliance.</p> <p>This bailout proposal puts them at each other's throats far more directly than I can ever remember in my adult lifetime. The decent common folk (almost all white, it should be mentioned) are usually egged on by right-wing populist talk radio jockeys and by politicians to aim their ire at the brown illegals or the homosexuals or the Harvard pointy-heads. Now they're being egged on against the bankers. It's a modern first. And the stakes are fascinating, and high.</p> <p>The always sagacious Mark Schmitt has written <a href=\"http://prospect.org/cs/articles?article=is_the_republican_alliance_finally_breaking\">an interesting take on this</a> at the American Prospect Web site. Why is this happening right now? That is, why are House Republicans rebelling so forcefully? Ideological reasons of course, but ideology is also, it is always to be remembered, driven by structural facts. And the key structural fact, Schmitt writes, is that the House GOP members now almost wholly represent Main Street-style districts:</p> <blockquote> <p>The House Republicans now represent white Americans of modest means -- the very opposite of the \"investor class.\" (Most of the Republicans who represented affluent districts were wiped out in 2006.) They are the ones whose phones are ringing off the hook with opposition to the bailout, the ones already saddled with an unpopular president, an unpopular war, and an uninspiring presidential nominee.</p> <p>Republican strategist Ed Rollins gave the game away on CNN: \"At the end of the day, there's a lot of people thinking about how to rebuild this party, and do we want to rebuild it with John McCain, who's always kind of questionable on the basic facts of fiscal control, all the rest of it, immigration. And I think to a certain extent this 110, 115 members of this study group are saying, here's the time to draw the line in the sand.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>A point very much worth keeping in mind. Senators represents entire states. Some states are small and largely rural. But most individual senators cannot, and the Senate as a body cannot, see itself as the representative of a purely conservative-populist-agrarian politics. America isn't Wyoming. And the affluent districts Schmidt refers to are, as Ruy Teixeira and John Judis (second mention today on Tomasky blog!) <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Emerging-Democratic-Majority-John-Judis/dp/0743254783\">anticipated years ago</a>, shading purple or even blue. So House Republicans are very logically representing the interests of the people, in some ways the <em>only</em> people, who vote for them.</p> <p>Problem: They aren't 51% of the country. Not even close. That's why the GOP needs the Wall Street end of the deal to hold up. But if the House GOP has its way -- and evidently, if John McCain has his way, since he's hitched his star to theirs -- the alliance may crumble. Back to Schmitt:</p> <blockquote> <p>he Republican coalition since at least Reagan has been a miraculous alliance of Wall Street and Main Street. Populist politics, such as the attack on \"elites\" now embodied by the enthusiasm for Gov. Sarah Palin, were the vehicle for Wall Street policies, the very policies that led to the crash. The alliance always seemed unsustainable. At some point it had to break -- you can't go on forever with policies that do nothing for your core constituencies. And now, in the backlash against the bailout, it has broken. The House Republicans see in that backlash an opportunity to, as Rollins says, \"rebuild this party\" on populist, anti-Wall Street grounds.</p> <p>There are only two problems with this tactic. First, the middle of a financial crisis that's about to turn into an economic crisis is a hell of a time to suddenly start listening to your constituents. But that's the problem with playing with populism -- eventually you have to deliver something, and it's likely to be something ugly.</p> <p>The second problem is that the Republicans still have nothing but reflexive Wall Street policies in their bag of tricks. The House Republicans' main alternative? Suspend the capital-gains tax for two years, to encourage banks to unload assets. Brilliant! Except that if these assets had produced capital gains, banks wouldn't be in trouble. But it would still be a nice giveaway for the top one percent. </p> </blockquote> <p>Well said.</p> <p>Final note: Schmitt mentions the great budget battle of 1990 as a spiritual antecedent to what's happening now (see a timeline of that <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6DC1439F93AA35753C1A966958260\">here</a>).<br>That year's budget deal, in which George H.W. Bush agreed with the Democrats to raise taxes, gave much impetus to a then much smaller group of House conservatives, who used right-populist resentment at the deal, which was cut at Andrews Air Force base (to say those three words in conservative circles to this day makes some people spit on the floor), as a way to build their numbers and eventually take over the House of Representatives four years thence.</p> <p>Their leader, then, was Newt Gingrich. So I was interested to read <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/thecrypt/0908/Is_Newt_still_running_the_show.html?showall\">this</a> in the Politico just this morning:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>If you didn't know any better, you'd think [House Republicans] were taking marching orders from Speaker-in-Exile Newt Gingrich. For the past week or so, he's been urging Congressional Republicans and John McCain to reject the $700 billion bailout and label it the \"Bush-Obama\" plan -- tying the Democratic nominee to the most toxic Republican since, well, Gingrich himself.</p> <p>Opposing the plan would also open up a world of political possibilities for Republicans still tepid about backing Senator Maverick, he's argued.</p> <p>If the GOP blocks the bailout, \"I think you will see the emergence overnight of a 'McCain Reform Wing of the Republican Party' and you'll see House and Senate members siding with McCain by overwhelming margins and then you'll be in a very different political environment,\" he told ABC a few days ago.</p> </blockquote> <p>A few days ago? It seems pretty clear that Gingrich was sketching out to ABC his desired scenario and then whispering in some ears up on Capitol Hill. Nothing wrong with that. Just interesting that a man who left politics in disgrace and drove his political bus over a cliff on the matter of the Clinton impeachment -- and who probably today has an approval rating of no higher than 32% or so -- still carries such weight.</p> <p>The circumstances were right in 1990 for such a nascent right-populist coalition to build. And Gingrich, rhetoric aside, just about always looked out for Wall Street. But whether he's right about that \"world of political possibilities\" today is another question. If the GOP holds onto Main Street and hands Wall Street to the Dems, how are they going to reach 51% (and where are they going to get their donations from?)</p> <p>Last point: If were Obama and David Axelrod, I'd be thinking about ways to tie McCain to Gingrich.</p>",
  "<p>Americans - most notably right-leaning Americans - used to issue dire warnings about sliding down \"the slippery slope\" on any number of hot-button political issues. From the slippery slope of <a href=\"http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?i=bc04c02\">same-sex marriage</a> to the slippery slope of <a href=\"http://www.guncite.com/journals/okslip.html\">gun control</a> to the slippery slope of <a href=\"http://www.cwfa.org/articledisplay.asp?id=1413&amp;department=CWA&amp;categoryid=life\">abortion rights</a> to the slippery slope of <a href=\"http://www.pushhamburger.com/slippery.htm\">immigration</a> and on and on, various political interest groups in America guarded that slope, with no small amount of zeal, lest any of us find our God-given rights or once-vaunted rule of law lost for good before we even noticed.</p> <p>Bad news. We've lost our God-given rights, at least our constitutional ones, and certainly the rule of law. The US is now in full-plummet down the slippery slope, due, in no small part, to a lack of courage, willingness, interest and imagination of those who might have kept it from happening long ago.</p> <p>Following the Democratic (and Republican) Congress's utter disinterest in taking action to oppose George W Bush's extra-constitutional legislative signing statements \u2013 in which he declared, <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/04/30/bush_challenges_hundreds_of_laws/\">many times over</a>, that he would neither obey certain laws himself, or didn't believe they applied to any departments of the executive branch - the slippery slope was nicely lubed up to allow for his Wall Street bail-out bill's <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/22/dirty-secret-of-the-bailo_n_128294.html\">remarkable \"Section 8\"</a>.</p> <p>Those 32 words in Bush's draft legislation allow for the complete control of at least $700bn in US taxpayer dollars by a single person, the secretary of the Treasury, and worse, stipulate: \"Decisions by the secretary pursuant to the authority of this act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion, and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency.\"</p> <p>But why should Republicans be concerned about that? After all, they themselves have attempted to undermine, or have otherwise out-and-out supported, the undermining of constitutional checks and balances by removing judicial reviews legislatively, or supporting the executive branch doing so, on everything from <a href=\"http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_member.php?cs_id=V3713\">detainee<br>rights</a> to <a href=\"http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com/2006/05/no-need-for-congress-no-need-for.html\">wiretapping American citizens</a> to building <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/01/30/bush_asserts_authority_to_bypass_defense_act/\">permanent US military bases</a> anywhere in the world they liked. (And that's just the proverbial tip of the iceberg, as many such Bush administration <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2007/06/19/us_agencies_disobey_6_laws_that_president_challenged/\">refusals to follow the law</a> had nothing to do with so-called national security issues.)</p> <p>And why should Democrats be suddenly indignant about Bush's Section 8? They've sat by and watched his usurpation of their co-equal congressional powers, and the powers of the court, happen before their very eyes. They failed to take action beyond a few congressional hearings (ignored by the media) and a number of sternly worded letters (ignored by the recipients). First, they claimed, they could do little about any of this, as they didn't have a majority in Congress. Then they claimed they didn't have enough of a majority. In both cases, oddly enough, Republicans and the Bush administration, generally got everything they wanted. Apparently not having a majority, for Republicans, is no problem at all.</p> <p>Bush administration officials have defied the rule of law time and again when it comes to congressional subpoenas. Karl Rove, Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten have all laughed in the face of Democratic (and <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=5437\">even bipartisan</a>) congressional attempts to force them to testify on any number of things. The Judiciary committees in both <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6231\">the House</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=5437\">the Senate</a> have recommended contempt of Congress citations against all three, but the Democratic leaders in both chambers have refused to bring those recommendations to the floor for a vote, even as Bush administration's department of justice has informed them that they <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=5247\">wouldn't bother enforcing</a> such subpoenas anyway.</p> <p>Congress's response to that direct spittle to the face? With the exception of a handful of congressmembers - most admirably Dennis Kucinich, who filed <a href=\"http://www.impeachbush.tv/progress/bush_dk.html\">35 articles of impeachment against Bush</a> (also ignored by congressional Democrats in the House) - they've done nothing to enforce the rule of law.</p> <p>So is it any wonder then that Sarah Palin's husband Todd, and five others, have now simply <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1842992,00.html\">refused to answer lawful subpeonas</a> to testify to an Alaskan congressional panel in the so-called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/sep/24/sarah.palin.troopergate\">Troopergate</a> scandal? Those scofflaws are simply following the example set for them by this White House and the nation's top law enforcement agency. A fish rots, it is said, from the head down. The first dude and his friends saw that ignoring the law has exactly zero consequences. So why even bother to show up? They didn't.</p> <p>I've <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/anthrax.usa\">written before</a> about the US having now fully become an outlaw nation, even as the bulk of its media outlets - and, in turn, its citizens - proceed as if everything is pretty much just politics as usual. It's not. It is anything but. It's a new and remarkable form of organised anarchy in which one major political party has abandoned their principles (if they ever actually had them in the first place) and another has been paralysed by complete fear and total denial.</p> <p>I find it all rather astonishing. America need no longer fear the slippery slope. We are now, officially, careening down it. Where it stops, nobody knows. But does anybody other than a few noisy and pesky citizens out here even care?</p>",
  "<p>A judge ruled today that the hip-hop star Busta Rhymes could remain in the UK to perform at a charity concert, hours before he was due on stage. </p> <p>Rhymes was within an hour of being deported yesterday because of criminal convictions in the US, before lawyers obtained an injunction preventing his removal. After being held at London City airport for 11 hours, he was released on bail pending today's hearing. </p> <p>Mr Justice Stadlen, sitting at London's high court, continued the injunction preventing Rhymes' removal from the UK. He emphasised the extraordinary nature of the case, stressing that he was acting so as not to disappoint thousands of fans on their way to the gig at the time the judgment was being handed down.</p> <p>The injunction gives Rhymes the opportunity to challenge the decision by immigration authorities to deny his entry and paved the way for him to perform at tonight's Orange RockCorps gig at the Royal Albert Hall - a free concert for 5,000 charity volunteers which he is headlining. The gig starts at 7pm.</p> <p>Rhymes, whose real name is Trevor Smith Jr, was kept in a small room with five armed police officers after being stopped by immigration officials when he arrived at the airport at 7.26am yesterday. The UK authorities wanted to fly him back to Amsterdam two hours later, citing \"unresolved convictions\" in America, but at 8.58am his legal team secured an injunction preventing him from getting on the flight.</p> <p>In March, Smith, 36, was given three years' probation in New York for assaulting his former driver and a fan who had allegedly spat on his car, in separate incidents. He was ordered to do 10 days' community service, pay a $1,250 (\u00a3675) fine plus costs and enrol in an anti-drink-driving programme.</p> <p>The judge at Manhattan criminal court warned Smith, whose hits include Woo Hah! Got You All in Check, Fire it Up and Everything Remains Raw: \"If you mess up, you're going to jail. I've given you a chance.\"</p> <p>In the wake of Smith's detention, Orange RockCorps said Ludacris, a fellow American hip-hop star and a friend of Rhymes, was added to the bill to perform alongside the Automatic, Guillemots, Lethal Bizzle, John Legend and Feeder in front of concert-goers who had earned their tickets by volunteering for four hours at community charity projects over the summer.</p> <p>A spokeswoman said Smith had been told he did not have permission to work in the UK due to what she described as his \"minor\" criminal record. But he had a valid work permit for tonight's show.</p>",
  "<p>Around the ancient and celebrated temples of Bagan, a tour guide blandly dispenses historical nuggets to tourists, his fury hidden beneath a bright smile. Myint Win, a novice monk, is taking a break from his monastery to earn some money in the town whose temples make it one of the country's premier tourist destinations.</p> <p>But times are hard. The protests against the Burmese regime that began a year ago renewed awareness of the tourism boycott of the country, and only the determined make it here these days. In Bagan, few hostels have more than one guest, tour guides say they haven't had a client in months and at the most celebrated temples there is a frantic edge to the hawkers as they plead for custom from the occasional visitor. </p> <p>The irony is not lost on Myint. \"Protesting not good for business,\" he says with a wry smile.</p> <p>In Mandalay, the tourists have vanished. The nightly performance of the Moustache Brothers, Burma's best-known comedians and renowned opponents of the regime, is struggling. Allowed to play only to foreigners, their audiences have dwindled. \"Some nights we cancel,\" says Lu Maw, one of the brothers. \"We can't perform with no audience.\"</p> <p>In the capital, Rangoon, a year after the protests the streets project an eerie impression of normality. Brief chats with those who will risk speaking to a foreigner reveal the fear that conditions everyone's lives. Eyes flick round cafes and voices are lowered before any opinion is expressed. Conversations in taxis or on rickshaws \u2013 anywhere an informer might be listening in \u2013 are studiously avoided. </p> <p>Today, Burma is back to the Orwellian paranoia that has passed for normality here for years, where anger and dissent must be hidden and the daily image of contentment maintained to ensure survival. The regime has tightened its grip, Human Rights Watch reported this week, with the continued arrest and detention of political activists. </p> <p>Myint, the 29-year-old novice monk, first heard about the protests over rising fuel prices at the end of August 2007. Within days, demonstrations had spread across the country to become the largest Burma had seen in decades. A monk in Rangoon phoned Myint. \"He said, you have to help us,\" recalls the novice.</p> <p>And so Myint began to march. In the high plains of Bagan, the sun blazed down on the bareheaded protesters. Walking with thousands of other young, angry men, Myint remembers the glare of the light and his bare feet burning on the hot tarmac. \"The people lined the streets to protect us,\" he says. \"They made sure they were between us and the military and they gave us water. I wasn't afraid because I knew what we were doing was right.\"</p> <p>Then the shooting began. Violating a core principle many believed even the junta must hold sacred, the authorities turned their guns on the monks. The images flooded out: soldiers shooting at unarmed, barefoot protesters, amateur footage smuggled across borders, illicit photos shot on mobile phones flashing around the world. The world reacted with shock; the junta's response was to shut down access to the internet and carry on.</p> <p>There was no shooting in Bagan, but Myint and his colleagues watched satellite pictures of events in Yangon with mounting horror. \"We watched the other marches \u2013 and then the violence. Everyone was shocked. The head of my monastery made the decision to stop the protests.\"</p> <p>Elsewhere, the crackdown was biting hard. Up in Mandalay, as tens of thousands took to the streets of Burma's religious heartland, two middle-aged men watched the monks go by. The authorities knew exactly who they were: Moustache Brothers Par Par Lay and Lu Maw. Three days later they came for Par Par. </p> <p>\"To be honest we had been expecting them. They came at night \u2013 as usual - and said they wanted to ask questions,\" says Lu Maw. \"They held him for just over 30 days.\" \"They kept asking who was organising the protests,\" adds Par Par. \"But I actually wasn't involved this time round, so I couldn't tell them anything.\"</p> <p>By the time the protests had finally been extinguished, more than 4,000 people had been detained, according to Bo Kyi, of the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an organisation in Thailand that helps political prisoners inside Burma. Many were tortured; monks were forced to disrobe, beaten and some placed in solitary confinement. An unknown number were killed.</p> <p>Those who escaped jail were cowed, and the protest movement evaporated as quickly as it had sprung up. The Burmese people who had dared to hope for real change retreated as the regime reasserted its grip.</p> <p>Four months ago came another devastating blow. In the early hours of May 3, Aung Thin was woken in the small, wooden house she shared with five other family members in her village deep in the Irrawaddy delta by the howl of the wind, then water pouring in. As the water rose, the family scrambled on to the roof. </p> <p>\"We managed to climb into a banyan tree next to our house,\" she says. \"Then the roof began to float and became trapped in the trees. So we climbed back on to it, like a raft. We could see children in the water. My father tried to pull them out but the current was too strong.\" There they clung for hours until day broke and cyclone Nargis, the worst storm to hit the delta in generations, finally passed.</p> <p>Aung tells her story outside the flimsy frame of the new, temporary house her family has built. They were lucky: the storm claimed an estimated 130,000 lives. </p> <p>Their problems are far from over. Four months on, they have a new fear: starvation. The storm swept away not just their harvest but their precious store of rice seeds, ploughing equipment and livestock. It dumped salt water in the paddy fields, rendering them infertile. \"We need to plant,\" says the village chief. \"We have got rid of the salt from fields. We've enough rice to live on for the moment \u2013 just,\" he says. \"But we have to plant.\"</p> <p>The needs could not be more evident, yet the response continues to lag. Money is short; the UN appeal has so far raised less than half of the money needed - $196m of $481m. The critical agriculture sector is just 14% funded. </p> <p>Most cyclone survivors rely on the only support on which they can count: each other. Within days of the cyclone, Myint's fellow monks stepped in to coordinate the delivery of donations across the delta. In Mandalay, Par Par Lay organised donations from the local theatrical scene and drove them in a procession led by a float down to Rangoon. According to the UN, in the first six weeks of the response alone the Burmese people raised a staggering $11m worth of aid. \"In the weeks afterwards, everyone was asking why there hadn't been more secondary deaths,\" says one aid worker in Rangoon. \"The answer is simple: the local response was \u2013 and continues to be \u2013 incredible.\"</p> <p>What happens next? The outlook is grim. There are widespread fears that the failure of the rice harvest will drive up prices of Burma's staple food, and the global credit crunch is biting hard. Black market costs of essentials such as fuel have gone up. Aung San Suu Kyi's house arrest shows no sign of ending. The initial protests may have been triggered by such hardships, but the chances of this happening again are remote. Anger at the inadequacy of the government response to Nargis has deepened the hatred of the junta, but it has not lessened the fear. </p> <p>\"We are still angry,\" says Myint. \"But we bury it here\" \u2013 and he thumps his heart. Myint says the monks are divided: some want more protests, others do not. There has been talk of an armed uprising and a desire for guns, but few see this as a real possibility. \"The monks will never take up arms,\" says Myint. \"Ordinary people, yes. But not the monks.\"</p> <p>A year on, would Myint protest again? It takes him a long time to answer this question as he leans against the warm stones of the ancient temple and looks out across the Bagan plain. In the peaceful light of the late afternoon sun, it is hard to remember the awful realities away from this serene temple plain: the hunger that clutches at Aung and many thousands like her, the suffering of the hundreds still held in Insein and the sheer courage of Par Par Lay, who survived years of hard labour and still will not be silenced. </p> <p>\"I would,\" he says finally, \"but we have no power, only our prayers and our mouths. The government has guns. We must wait and hope. One day, our time will come.\"</p> <p><em>Names have been changed for this article.</em></p>",

  "<p>Gordon Brown today called for an end to \"the age of irresponsibility\", apparently handing his Conservative critics a free chance to blame him for his role in creating a culture of greed as chancellor for the past decade. </p> <p>The prime minister's remarks, in a speech to the United Nations general assembly calling for new systems of international regulation of the big global financial players, were immediately seized upon by George Osborne, the shadow chancellor.</p> <p>Brown said: \"This has been an age of global prosperity. It has also been an era of global turbulence and where there has been irresponsibility we must now clearly say the age of irresponsibility must be ended.\" </p> <p>Osborne retorted: \"Gordon Brown has now accurately described his time in office as the 'age of irresponsibility'. For ten years he presided over a debt-fuelled boom and failed to call time on debt. The age of irresponsibility has now become the age of hypocrisy.\"</p> <p>Brown made his remarks before flying to Washington to meet George Bush in the midst of the US president's efforts to persuade a rebellious Congress to give bipartisan support for a $700bn Wall Street bail-out package. </p> <p>The prime minister's presence in Washington at the epicentre of the crisis will help to burnish his credentials as an international financial statesman, even if he can do little to create political consensus in Congress. </p> <p>Brown gave broad support for the package and said he would continue with the British strategy of addressing problems in individual institutions, rather than establishing an over-arching package. </p> <p>The prime minister's official spokesman refused to date when this age of irresponsibility started and said the remarks were a reference to the way in which \"large financial institutions had racked up large liabilities that they were themselves unable to quantify\".<br> Brown insists he has been trying to forge a tighter international regulatory structure for years, but at the weekend Britain was singled out along with the US by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, for long resisting her proposals to control hedge funds and credit rating agencies. As politicians head for cover from the retribution of their electorates, an international game of blame-passing seems already under way. </p> <p>Brown called for a new world order based on transparency and not opacity. He predicted that by the end of the year the 30 largest global finance institutions and banks would each be subject to internationally coordinated monitoring by an international \"college of regulation\". </p> <p>The PM, who has kept in touch with market developments in the UK from the US, said he was not going to intervene in the highly political dispute in Washington on whether to back the $700bn bail-out, but he gave the proposals his broad backing. </p> <p>\"America deserves support from the rest of the world as it seeks to agree in detail what all parties agree in principle,\" he said. </p> <p>In practice, the dispute in Congress seems to have widened so much \u2013 with Republicans calling for an insurance based solution \u2013 that it is hard to argue that there has even been agreement in principle to the package.</p> <p>Brown, setting out his medium-term solutions to the crisis, said: \"Confidence in the future is needed to build confidence today and that confidence will be built by showing that what are global problems can also be addressed by globally coordinated solutions.\" </p> <p>He called for the new international architecture that is being drawn up by the financial stability forum to be built on five principles of transparency, including sound banking practice, responsibility, integrity and global regulation. </p> <p>He argued: \"The international institutions created in the aftermath of world war two have not kept pace with the changing global economy. We need national regulators to be cooperative, rules and principles to be consistent and international movements of capital to be transparent.\" </p> <p>He demanded \"sound banking practice and more effective regulation\" and greater responsibility. \"No member of senior management should be able to say they did not understand the risks they were running and walk away from their obligations,\" he said. </p> <p>Brown is to back a call for a world leaders summit on the financial crisis that is being sought by Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president and holder of the EU presidency. No date has been set for the meeting. </p> <p>Speaking to the UN earlier today, Brown hailed an \"historic summit\" at which another $16bn had been committed to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \"It's demonstrated to the world that in the face of economic challenges we must do more not less to help the poorest of the world,\" he told a press conference last night.</p>",
  "<p>The international financial crisis took another dramatic twist today when Washington Mutual, America's biggest savings and loans company, collapsed in the early hours and a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/25/wallstreet.useconomy1\">$700bn (\u00a3380bn) bailout package </a>for the financial sector was in jeopardy.

  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Brooklyn. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Will Roan (vocals), Simon O'Connor (guitar), plus a rotating cast of thousands, well, tens. Actually, seven at last count. <br> <strong>The background:</strong> Most \"movements\" gain attention because of one genuinely great band while the rest hang on their coattails. But that's not true of the current scene based around acts operating in the Brooklyn area who met earlier this decade at liberal arts college Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. MGMT may have been the first out of the traps, the first to gain global renown \u2013 and it was us who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/nov/09/popandrock3\">told you about them first</a>, folks, up here at New Band of the Day \u2013 but they're by no means the only Wesleyan alumni worth getting into a tizz over. There's the effortlessly cool punk-disco of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/28/boy.crisis\">Boy Crisis</a> and the ambient folktronica meets latterday power balladry of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/03/new.band.of.the.day.382.chairlift?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=music\">Chairlift</a>. Last but by no means least are Amazing Baby, who are amazing, baby, but who hadn't even formed when we unleashed MGMT on an unsuspecting world way back in the mists of time, in November 2007. <br> No, they didn't get together until January 1, 2008, when Will Roan and Simon O'Connor, the core duo and creative masterminds of Amazing Baby, decided that it might be a nice idea to form a group capable of being simultaneously epic and anthemic yet with a richly detailed sound that could incorporate psych, folk, prog, funk and pop elements without it being a horrible mish-mash of opposites. They love the studio whizkiddery and sonic trickery of Brian Eno and Lindsay Buckingham - look out for the multi-tracking and overdubbing, reverb and echo - as well as the choral majesty of Queen even if, live, they can't hope to approximate the lush intricacy of their recordings and so go instead for a stripped-down rawk attack. Without a doubt, it could have been sprawling and inchoate but somehow all the elements cohere quite beautifully. In fact, they've created an organic new hybrid, and now we just need a name for it. Choral stadium folk-metal? Too unwieldy. Prunkadelia?! Do send in suggestions.  Meanwhile, let's meet the players: Roan is the enigmatic shaman \u2013 the Andrew Vanwyngarden of the piece \u2013 who, it has been said, \"prowls the front of stage like a pre-pipe'n'slippers Richard Ashcroft\", while O'Connor, who was in a porn-rock band with those MGMT boys at college called Misogynistic Pineapple, has been said to resemble \"a Faith No More-loving metal-head who wandered into the wrong audition by mistake\". An odd couple, perhaps, but these acid-loving hippie throwbacks (on their MySpace the cheeky scamps say they're signed to a tiny imprint called Psilocybe but actually they're about to ink a deal with a major) have charismatazz by the bucketload. They did their first photo shoot naked, they talk about cosmic dentists, they'd like to play a gig inside a medieval volcano while on their website, under the heading \"About Amazing Baby\", there is a photograph of a mushroom cloud after an atomic blast. Like, heavy, man.  But they're no space cadets. They know what they're doing. Having made available their self-produced Invisible Fucking Cross EP via their website earlier this year, the band make their first trip to the UK in November supporting MGMT before starting work on their debut album with Claudius (Muse, Interpol) Mittendorfer. If it includes some of the tracks on their MySpace \u2013 the celestial bliss-rock of Head Dress, and The Narwhal, which sounds like T Rex on the moon \u2013 it will be something very special indeed. <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"These Brooklyn scenesters pile layers of noisy, cascading guitars onto an 'aohw aohw' chorus like wayward glam refugees munching 'shrooms.\"</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> We don't want to be accused of hype and turning Wesleyan into the Noughties version of Swinging London or Madchester, but this makes four great bands on the trot. Out of one college. What did Trent Poly ever do for us?<br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Encourage pilgrimages to Middletown.<br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Appeal to Middle America. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Pump Yr Brakes is released on November 10 by Another Music Another Kitchen. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Polyphonic Spree, MGMT, Grateful Dead, Hawkwind.<br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/theamazingbaby\">www.myspace.com/theamazingbaby</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theamazingbaby.com\">www.theamazingbaby.com</a><br><strong><br>Monday's new band:</strong> Woodpigeon.</p>",

  "<p>This week I've explained a number of little things about the way the Guardian Technology website works to help you get a little more out - first <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/sep/24/1\">how our site's organised</a>, then some details on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/sep/25/blogpost\">our RSS feeds</a>.</p> <p>Today I'm going to explain a couple of things that are direct benefits of registering to leave comments on the site. </p> <p>In order to comment on any article on the Guardian website - including some news stories, opinion pieces and all of our blog posts - you have to register. It's a bummer, in many ways, but it does help weed out the trolls a little.</p> <p>One added benefit, however, is that every commenter gets their own user profile page at theguardian.com/users/username (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/users/bobbiejohnson\">here's mine, for example</a>. We're planning on adding extra functions to user profiles over time, but what exactly can you do with it right now? </p> <p>Well, first of all it keeps all of your comments in one place. That's great if you can't remember exactly what you said, or where you said it. Just click on the 'show all comments' - or go straight to theguardian.com/users/username/comments</p> <p>This can be useful for you, but also handy to check <em>other</em> people's comments. Suspect somebody's a troll? Check their most recent comments to see if they just spend their days trying to wind people up across the site. Or perhaps they've got a serious thing for complaining about one pet hate, and you don't need to bother responding. Whatever, you can make a more informed choice about how you comment and talk with other users.</p> <p>Also on the user profile page you can see clippings. This is an internal bookmarking service that we've got for the Guardian, and one we're planning on expanding over time. Just press the little pink scissors icon visible on the right hand side of any article to keep a copy on file. You can even build your own special pages pulling together articles from across the site - over on our Inside Guardian blog earlier this year, my colleague Sean Clarke <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/help/insideguardian/2008/may/23/wouldyouliketobe\">explained how it works</a>.</p> <p>Oh, and you get an avatar too. Right now you can't upload pictures to your profile, but you can at least choose a colour for your Cluedo-esque virtual representative on Guardian.co.uk.</p> <p>There's more to come in this area - and suggestions are always welcome.</p>",
  "<p>Fake cough? Check. Handkerchief placed neatly over the receiver? Check. Spurious - but elaborate - excuse involving a chest infection, washing machine or family pet (or ideally all three)? Check. Then you're ready to begin your attempt to skive off work. It never used to be this difficult. Back in the day (say, early 2007) companies were still handing out <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/career_and_jobs/article2041469.ece \">duvet days</a> willy nilly. But no more. According to AXA, 72% of us are turning in for work <a href=\"http://www.peoplemanagement.co.uk/pm/articles/2008/09/british-staff-too-busy-for-sick-leave.htm \">even when we are really sick</a>, with 24% of us doing so because we have too much work to do. </p> <p>Perhaps the problem is not that we are busy bees, but rather that some of us want to be queen bees. <a href=\"http://working.canada.com/resources/story.html?id=18908804-147c-42bd-92e1-508e17ff6a5c\">A study</a> by the University of Toronto has found that women with a female boss are more likely to be stressed than those with a male one. Professor Scott Schieman, who led the research, says that his team don't yet know why this might be - but fear not, because <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1059997/Why-women-harder-working-Queen-Bee-male-boss.html\">The Daily Mail does!</a> It's all down to something called \"queen bee syndrome\" apparently, where an otherwise successful woman is afflicted - nay, struck down - by an intense dislike of \"competitors\" of the same sex. If only women would stay in the kitchen where they belong we wouldn't have these sorts of problems.</p> <p>It's not all doom and gloom, though. This week, equalities minister, Harriet Harman, said she wouldn't rule out forcing private firms to publish their <a href=\"http://www.personneltoday.com/articles/2008/09/26/47620/gender-pay-gap-compulsion-threat-hangs-over-private-sector.html\">gender pay gaps</a>. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission has also committed to investigating sectors showing \"clear inequality\". Earlier in the week, the pay gaps of all government departments were published. The Foreign Office (where men are paid 19.3% more) and the Home Office (18.2%) came bottom, while the Equalities Office (-0.9%) came out top, proving in the process that equal pay for equal work is not just a crazy idea that couldn't possibly work in practice.</p> <p>Elsewhere we learned that the newly created CBI Higher Education Taskforce will be charged with <a href=\"http://www.peoplemanagement.co.uk/pm/articles/2008/09/cbi-creates-higher-education-taskforce.htm \">\"examining what business wants from higher education\"</a>. Melfort Campbell, CEO of Imes Group, said: \"I want the HE sector to provide more graduates with degrees which are relevant to our business. Industry needs to be clear on which degree subjects are considered valuable.\"</p> <p>This does not bode well for office life. Let's just hope they don't get too literal or we'll get a generation of graduates who know how to use the photocopier but can't hold a conversation about anything apart from work.</p> <p>Lastly, <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/career_and_jobs/article4421544.ece\">this</a> has been doing the rounds for some time, but only plopped into my inbox this week. Forget the management theory - just watching assorted head honchos trying to leap as high as Masai tribal elders is priceless.</p>",
  "<p>Abandoned pint glasses, overgrown gardens, heavily curtained windows and loud kerfuffles at the crack of dawn.</p> <p>If housing minister Caroline Flint has her way, these hallmarks of undergraduate living could soon vanish to restore suburban order to student-saturated streets.<br>In some areas, students outnumber local residents. Belfast's Queen's University students inhabit more than half of houses in the immediate vicinity of the campus while around two-thirds of the 10,000 residents of Headingley, in Leeds, are students, all packed into 73 streets of terraced houses.</p> <p>Town-gown relations are notoriously tense during term time in cities such as Leeds, Nottingham and Southampton.</p> <p>The government's plan is to halt the \"studentification\" of university towns by capping the number of houses in multiple occupation (HMO).</p> <p>Flint wants councils to get together with universities to plan more purpose-built accommodation. She says her main concern is communities left as \"ghost towns\" when students desert them during the summer months.</p> <p>But let's not forget why these ghettos sprung up in the first place. </p> <p>Thanks in part to the government's ambitious target to get 50% of young people into higher education, the UK's student population has swelled to 2.5 million.</p> <p>Couple this with an average student debt of \u00a317, 500 and you can't blame students \u2013 and landlords for that matter \u2013 for searching out the cheapest, most convenient housing, however overcrowded or antisocial this may be for their neighbours.</p> <p>Flint's drive to \"blend student populations into well-mixed neighbourhoods\" seems a seriously delayed reaction to a problem that has been building up for years. And announcing her plans in the middle of a dip in the housing market is unlikely to get landlords on board with changes in legislation.</p> <p>A spokesman for the housing charity Shelter said: \"This seems to be a cheap dig at students, many of whom are forced to live in HMOs because it's the only way they can afford to attend university.</p> <p>\"Students are often some of the most exploited people in the private rented sector, having to live in poor but expensive accommodation because it's located near the college or university.</p> <p>\"If the government really wants to tackle the issue, it should be looking at the sector as a whole and not just blame students.\"</p> <p>And Wes Streeting, president of the National Union of Students, fears that \"added bureaucracy will discourage landlords from the HMO market\".</p> <p>The truth is that universities and clusters of their students bring in a substantial income to many towns and cities.</p> <p>According to Universities UK, higher education institutions generate \u00a345m each year, and for every 100 university employees, a further 99 jobs are created in the wider economy as a knock-on effect.</p> <p>So, in theory, top marks to Flint for recognising that many UK university towns are swamped with students. </p> <p>In practice though, with so many millions of young people in full-time higher education, the ghost-town problem is unlikely to disappear.</p>",

It's high time that we have top Christian businessmen, businesswomen, bankers, you know, who are men and women of integrity running the economics of our nations,\" he said, his remarks captured in recently unearthed video footage. Then he continued: \"If you look at the \u2013 you know \u2013 if you look at the Israelites, that's how they work. And that's how they are, even today.\"<br> It's seems pretty clear that Muthee was alluding to Jewish control over global finance. But if Sarah Palin objected, she certainly didn't show it when, a few minutes later, she joined him on stage. There, as she bowed her head and turned her palms toward heaven, Muthee laid hands on her and beseeched God to pump money into her gubernatorial campaign coffers. \"Bring finances her way, even for the campaign, in the name of Jesus,\" he prayed. Earlier this year, speaking at the church, <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gvCzZ0SoitdKvCm5L-qbcB6KSGUQD93DIUQ80\">Palin gave Muthee part of the credit</a> for her victory. \"He said, 'Lord, make a way, and let her do this next step,' and that's exactly what happened. Again, very, very powerful coming from this church, so that was awesome,\" she said.<br> We've seen, in this surreal campaign season, a surfeit of problematic preachers, raising questions of how much responsibility politicians have for their religious consorts. Barack Obama continues to be excoriated for his long association with the Rev Jeremiah Wright, whose <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/14/AR2008011402083.html\">connections to Louis Farrakhan</a> are being used to frighten some Jewish voters. Yet Obama never had any direct relationship with Farrakhan, nor did he ever join Wright onstage during one of his inflammatory sermons. There is nothing in Obama's history to suggest any tolerance for, let alone comfort with, anti-Semitism. It is not clear that the same could be said for Palin.<br> Politicians are not accountable for everything said in their presence, or everything uttered by their supporters. If Muthee's comments were the only time Palin appeared to condone anti-Jewish language, it would probably be fair to overlook it. Palin is not, after all, a terribly worldly woman, and it is possible that Muthee's Protocols of the Elders of Zion reference went right over her head.  But this incident was not unique. When Palin <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/03/us/politics/03wasilla.html?pagewanted=all\">ran for governor against incumbent Republican John Stein</a> in 1996, her supporters argued that Wasilla needed a \"Christian\" mayor. \"My background is Lutheran,\" said Stein. \"Does this mean that people think I'm not a Christian?\" It did indeed. Some of Palin's backers may have just been suggesting that Stein wasn't a real Christian, but as I learned when I visited Wasilla earlier this month, there was also a rumour that he was Jewish.<br> Palin isn't overtly hostile to Jews, of course \u2013 indeed, one of her daughter Bristol's best friends comes from one of Wasilla's few Jewish families. Yet the religious milieu that shaped her is, at the very least, more anti-Jewish than the one that nurtured Obama. Less than two weeks before Palin was chosen as John McCain's running mate, she <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/sep/04/uselections2008.sarahpalin3\">sat in the congregation at Wasilla Bible Church</a> as David Brickner, executive director of Jews for Jesus, suggested that violence in Israel was part of God's judgment on non-Christians. \"But what we see in Israel,\" he said, \"the conflict that is spilled out throughout the Middle East ... is an ongoing reflection of the fact that there is judgment. \u2026 When Jesus was standing in the temple, he spoke that that judgment was coming, that there's a reality to the judgment of unbelief.\"<br> Can we attribute Brickner's views to Palin? Of course not. We can, however, conclude that they are not uncommon in Palin's church. While in Wasilla, I <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/doc/20081013/goldberg\">interviewed Curt Menard</a>, a local politician who is very close to Palin. She was a classmate and close friend of Menard's late son, who, before he died in a 2001 plane crash, was the godfather of Palin's son Track. His wife, Linda, the former director of the Miss Wasilla pageant, recruited Palin into beauty contests, and the couple is currently caring for Palin's dog. Like Palin, they attend Wasilla Bible Church, and I asked Menard about whether we could determine anything about Palin's stance on the Middle East from her religion. He immediately started talking about Brickner. \"He spoke on Jews for Jesus, and I think in his opinion \u2026 the fact that a lot of the problems and issues that Israel has in the world, is because they haven't accepted Christianity,\" said Menard. He couldn't say whether Palin shares such views, but he said they were not controversial among the congregation.<br> Imagine, for a moment, that Obama had a similar record. Imagine that he joined a preacher onstage right after that preacher had spoken about \"Israelite\" control of the financial sector. Imagine that he had won his first local election against a man with a Jewish-sounding last name amid suggestions that his opponent wasn't really a Christian. Imagine that he had sat in church this summer and listened without protest to a sermon blaming Israel's agonies on the country's adherence to Judaism. All this would likely have resulted in something near hysteria among both the professional media and the demagogues of talk radio.  Yet on Palin, the self-appointed defenders of American Jewry have been fairly quiet. That's because, when it comes to the chosen people, those on the left are held to very different standards than those on the right. Palin, like many right-wing evangelicals, is wildly hawkish on Israel, and in American politics, that's seen as synonymous with friendliness toward the Jewish people. Yet as Pat Robertson and many others have proven, promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories is not incompatible with fanatical Zionism. Palin would, in all likelihood, be an ally of that messianic fringe of the Jewish community determined to thwart any possibility of peace with the Middle East. That doesn't mean her candidacy shouldn't give other American Jews real reason to worry.</p>",

The word on the street (OK, it's the word in the popular entertainment press that you find in a supermarket next to the <a href=\"http://www.hersheys.com/products/details/reesespeanutbuttercups.asp\">Reese's peanut butter cups</a>) is that - following Russell Brand's <a href=\"http://omg.yahoo.com/news/jordin-sparks-russell-brand-spar-over-purity-rings-at-vmas/12831\">ring-poking stint</a> in charge of the VMA awards - <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/ricky-gervais\">Ricky Gervais</a> is the hot tip to present next year's Oscars ceremony.</p> <p>According to Entertainment Weekly, Gervais's performance at last weekend's Emmys (see above) has lit up lightbulbs in the heads of various executives, who are now considering giving the Reading native control over several hours of song and dance routines next February. Apparently, <a href=\"http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2008/09/ricky-gervais.html\">\"his reps were besieged with inquiries about his availability\"</a>.</p> <p>The Emmy clip is undeniably pretty funny, but don't these Hollywood people know that <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/jul/11/callmecrazybuthasrickyge\">the Guardian announced that Ricky Gervais was over</a> a whole year ago after his not entirely successful linking sting at the <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2k5qk_ricky-gervais-concert-for-diana_fun\">concert for Diana </a>?

And, furthermore, is there something ineffable in the British genetic makeup that makes us predisposed to give better award show host action? Think about it. Then reply.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Horse play</strong></p> <p>Daniel Radcliffe was back in the saddle last night, reprising his role in Equus on Broadway to the delight of celebrity-studded audience and critics alike. The Harry Potter star first took the part in London last year, before being succeeded by Alfie Allen.</p> <p>Ben Brantley, writing in the <a href=\"http://theater2.nytimes.com/2008/09/26/theater/reviews/26equu.html?ref=theatre\">New York Times</a>, praises the boy wizard's sensitive and intelligent portrayal of the disturbed stable boy, Alan Strang, focusing on his \"Alsatian-blue gaze\" which \"snags your attention with an extra, possibly dangerous gleam of intensity\". He has less praise for the \"arid\" and \"dated\" psychodrama, however.</p> <p>But words of wonder gallop in thick and fast for the 19-year-old's performance: \"The Harry Potter star puts to rest any arguments that his appeal should be limited to moony adolescents and maudlin grown-ups\", enthuses <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/life/theater/reviews/2008-09-25-equus_N.htm\">USA Today</a>, while over at Newsday Linda Winer writes: \"[Radcliffe] bravely established himself as a smart, intense, wildly serious stage talent\".</p> <p>In marked contrast to the British press, which couldn't resist focusing on Radcliffe's \"<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/02/28/btequus28.xml\">naked talent</a>\" when the play premiered in London in 2007, the US papers seem not to dwell on the actor's nudity. Not so for <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,428284,00.html\">Fox News</a> whose headline condenses Shaffer's complex thriller into: \"Harry Potter Gets Naked, Horses Around\".</p> <p>Back across the pond, the Daily Mail's Baz Bambigboye reveals that \"Harry's next trick\" will be a return to the London stage in a new play by David Pugh. Fans will have to wait a couple of years, though, as there's the small matter of shooting a blockbuster in the meantime - the final Potter movie, Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows.</p> <p><strong>No one puts Harvey in the corner</strong></p> <p>Royal ballet principal Martin Harvey, who has been with the company since he was 11, will take over the role of Johnny Castle in the original London production of Dirty Dancing - The Classic Story On Stage, now in its third year. Also joining him on stage from September 29 2008 will be Leanne Rowe as Frances \"Baby\" Houseman in her West End debut at the Aldwych Theatre production. Rowe played Nancy in Roman Polanski's 2005 Oliver Twist, while Harvey, who has played such roles as Mercutio in Rome and Juliet and Crown Prince Rudolf in Mayerling, appeared to be very pleased indeed to be following in Patrick Swayze's footsteps: \"It has long been an ambition to play a lead in the West End, to be taking the role of such an iconic and inspirational character as Johnny Castle is a genuine thrill,\" he said in a statement.</p> <p><strong>Nunn's musical factory</strong></p> <p>After the \u00a34m flop that was Gone with the Wind - cancelled after just 79 performances at the New London Theatre - West End veteran Trevor Nunn is turning his directing skills to yet another musical. This time he is to revive Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's 1973 Broadway musical A Little Night Music at the Menier Chocolate Factory in London. The production \u2013 which marks Nunn's Sondheim debut - will open on December 3 2008 at the 190-seat Southwark venue, where its limited season continues until March 8 2009. </p> <p>The fairytale musical is inspired by Ingmar Bergman's 1955 film, Smiles of a Summer Night, following the tangled romantic lives of four mismatched couples in Sweden at the turn of the 20th century. The score, largely written in waltz time, includes the Grammy-winning ballad Send in the Clowns.</p> <p>The show won six Tony awards when it premiered on Broadway in 1973, ahead of its 1975 West End premiere at the Adelphi Theatre. It was last seen on the London stage in 1995 at the National Theatre and at the West End's Piccadilly Theatre in 1989. The cast for the National's revival included Patricia Hodge, Sian Phillips, Joanna Riding and Judi Dench, who won a Best Actress in a Musical Olivier award for her performance.</p> <p>Full casting has yet to be announced for the new production, which will be designed by Menier regular David Farley, who won a hat trick of awards for Sondheim's Sunday in the Park with George. It will be choreographed by Lynne Page, with musical supervision by Caroline Humphris, orchestrations by Jason Carr and lighting by Hartley T A Kemp. Nunn's previous successes have included Cats and Les Mis\u00e9rables - the longest running musical in West End history - as well as his recent production of King Lear starring Sir Ian McKellen. Earlier this year, Nunn directed Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage, after the Swedish director's 1973 film of the same name, in Coventry.</p>",

  "<p>\"Hopefully we won't have a black-out,\" said Felipe Massa yesterday. \"Because then it will be very difficult.\" Don't ever suggest that racing drivers would struggle to fill out a Funday Times crossword puzzle, for the Brazilian has hit on one of the many issues surrounding this weekend's Singapore grand prix \u2014 formula one's first ever night race.</p> <p>There is the air of adventure, of danger and of charting unknown territories ... albeit with the lights on. That the Le Mans 24 Hours \u2014 which features huge stretches without so much as a zip lighter for illumination \u2014 has been running for longer than the formula one world championship is of no concern here. Instead, let's ponder some of the unique issues faced by grand prix drivers as they try to make the country they've travelled thousands of miles to race at bend a little bit more to <em>their</em> needs.</p> <p>Formula one time: the whole point of creating a motor race that starts at 10pm is not to give young racers pampered by driver aids the opportunity to really show what they're made of. That would be silly. No, it's to make sure that viewers back in Europe are watching formula one, not Diagnosis Murder, while they tuck into their roast dinners. But how is the paddock coping with the prospect of a race that starts at 10pm? By creating their own time zone, of course.</p> <p>While certain individuals will be happy to while away the small hours until they go to bed at 4am local time \u2014 thanks, David Coulthard, for revealing to the world how you will be doing this with other half Karen \u2014 others are confused by the wonky logic. Don't be surprised if Sebastian Vettel turns up at one of Red Bull's legendary booze-ups wearing his Transformer pyjamas and clutching Gunther the teddy. Actually, that's not too far-fetched \u2014 my venerable colleague Alan Henry tells me that Jacques Laffite once arrived at an early morning practice in Dallas wearing his jim-jams ...</p> <p>Lock-down: according to DC, the area of Singapore where the paddock is protectively huddled together is under lock-down (I think he means for the locals \u2014 or does he?). Anyway, it's caused a bit of a stir. \"I expected the city to be a bit more adapted to our time as when I was trying to get dinner last night at three o'clock in the morning, I could find only one place open other than room service! And you don't want to do a week of room service.\" Heaven forbid that an army of poor Singaporeans toil for hours to bring steaming bowls of local delicacies to your door without you having to step foot into the night air. That would be horrendous.</p> <p>Around 3,180,000 watts of power: come on guys, do you really think there's a better way to use this tiny country's resources than making a night-time race look like it's happening in the daylight? Just don't try suggesting this has anything to do with the Daily Mail's report that <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1062089/Back-Dark-Ages-National-Grid-raises-spectre-blackouts-winter.html \">Britain is facing black-outs this winter</a>. Those blokes at the National Grid could learn a lot from the formula one way of doing things, though.</p> <p>Rain drops keep fallin' on my head: hotel receptionists are under strict instructions not to play the Burt Bacharach classic in their lobbies lest the team strategists' brains short circuit. Apparently there's a 50% chance that rain will fall and as the light refracts through the spray \u2014 they've already sorted the visors to make sure drops cannot settle \u2014 the drivers will be dazzled. Sources say this could be good news for Lewis Hamilton as it is akin to stepping out of a restaurant with his Pussycat Dolls girlfriend and being hit by the flashes of 72 paparazzi cameras. It is unclear whether Ferrari will complain to the FIA that he has an unfair advantage. Meanwhile, the spectators seated in the lower levels of the grandstands are taking precautions to avoid receiving third-degree burns and retina damage from the 3,000 lux lights (that's four times stronger than at a Premier League football match apparently, but don't try staring directly into one to check).</p> <p>It sounds like a whole lotta fun for everyone out in Asia, but as one weary theguardian.com blogger typed: \"I think most fans don't mind if a race is on the moon, just make it a decent one.\" Hang on, there's a thought. \"Bernie ...\"</p> <h2>Last weekend's action</h2> <p>British Touring Car Championship star Fabrizio Giovanardi hadn't finished out of the points for 40 races until the Brands Hatch finale where he nevertheless clinched his second consecutive BTCC crown and eighth top touring car title. It was a bizarre weekend for the Italian legend, who headed into Sunday's three races needing to score just nine points more than Jason Plato. In the end he missed one race through a problem with his Vauxhall's engine and scored just a single point by setting the fastest lap in the final encounter. The crown would, therefore, have been Plato's had the Seat man not suffered his own dramas.</p> <p>Both these racers have now passed the 40 years mark and it would be wrong to call them arch rivals. Talking about Seat's decision to end its motor sport activities in the UK \u2014 which leaves Plato looking for a new drive \u2014 Giovanardi told me: \"I'm really sorry for Jason, he's one of the fastest guys ... and I need a competitor.\" He might just have one with Mat Jackson, however, as the BMW Dealer Team UK youngster pipped Plato to second overall in the series with two wins at Brands Hatch, in what was a very unpredictable weekend.</p> <h2>This weekend's action</h2> <p>An incredible line-up of rally legends will descend on Perth tomorrow for the 2008 Colin McRae Forest Stages Rally, a year on from the former world champion's death. The names on the list of those taking part reveal all there is to be said about how much the Scottish star was revered and is missed: Alister and Jim McRae, Bjorn Waldegard, Ari Vatanen, Hannu Mikkola, Stig Blomqvist, Louise Aitken-Walker, Malcolm Wilson ...</p>",
  "<p>You may have noticed that besides getting younger, police officers are also flaunting a lot more technology. Besides their walkie-talkie, pepper spray, truncheon, stab vest, handcuffs and notebook, they're starting to wield all sorts of other gadgets \u2013 route-finders, BlackBerries, you name it. The average police car now resembles a baby Stealth bomber; press the wrong button on the dashboard and you'd probably launch an attack on whoever we're at war with this week.</p> <p>But it occurs to me that our problem is not that the police have too much technology. Quite the opposite: a little bit more of a system that's already being used for fun \u2013 and looking for a home \u2013 would make policing both more reliable and more effective.</p> <p>So here's what to do. Equip police officers with little video cameras able to record every moment of their working day. The technology already exists: Microsoft's Cambridge Research team has been demonstrating something like it for years, under the <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/sendev/projects/sensecam/\">Sensecam</a> name. Their idea was that it could be useful for people with memory problems who wanted to remember where they left their keys, though it only does photos, not video. But of course we've now got incredibly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/sep/04/digitalvideo.gadgets\">cheap handheld camcorders</a> like Pure Digital's Flip and the Kodak Zi6.</p> <p>Yes, I know that the police already have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jul/12/humanrights.ukcrime\">webcams on their helmets in some places</a>. But this goes far beyond that. Those cameras are expensive and limited in storage. I'm talking about something small, unobtrusive, cheap and, most of all, used all the time.</p> <p>The principal problem for the police is that they still spend <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jan/31/uk.uknews4\">too much time filling in forms</a>. Second, the number of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/feedarticle/7825241\">complaints about police behaviour has increased dramatically</a>. Though a police spokesman insists they're unjustified.</p> <p>Having the Sensecam \u2013 or its big video brother \u2013 attached to a police officer would simplify things. There'd be a pinhole camera and microphone attached to their uniform, linked to a solid-state store on their belt (say). What they see is what the camera sees. If they're trying to arrest someone, they'll see their face, and so will the camera. If they stop and search someone, the details are going to be audible. At the end of the day they can plug the storage into a computer at the police station, where it'll be downloaded, tagged and stored.</p> <p>Here's the next part: if they need to fill in details about an arrest or search, then they call up the film, zip through it to the relevant bit, and tag that to the document they're filling in \u2013 which of course, in our newly minted police world, will be on a computer. Less typing involved.</p> <p>If that sounds a bit unlikely, consider that we're already used to seeing in police videos. Car chases (with GPS and speed displayed on the bottom of the screen) have become standard fodder on TV channels; footage of police custody interviews is often released after a defendant is found guilty. We're also accustomed to fly-on-the-wall footage of the police going about their business arresting people who are too drunk to stand up properly yet somehow not drunk enough not to fight.</p> <p>Policing has changed radically. Up to the 1980s, when tape-recording of police interviews became mandatory, it was still a defendant's (and their lawyer's) word against the police's about precisely what had been said in the interview room. But with audio recording, and the addition of video, we can hear and see for ourselves what really happened.</p> <p>I'm not saying it would solve our policing problems overnight. Police officers would feel uncomfortable with the idea that their chat while they're on the beat would be recorded, perhaps for all time. They'd feel observed. There'd be the problems of lenses or microphones being conveniently obscured to cover up malfeasance. There'd be the problem of teaching a generation of police how to operate video. There'd be the hassle of storing the data and keeping it backed up; storage demands would soar.</p> <p>Yet with the cost of storage halving every year, this has to be feasible. It might not come soon, but with people complaining about the police, and the police complaining about form-filling, it's got to be an improvement. Everyone keeps talking about getting police back on to the streets and away from the keyboard. So let's be having you, officers, and don't forget the battery pack for the video.</p>",
  "<p>British Airways cancelled at least 20 flights from Heathrow and Gatwick today after a computer failure at Britain's main air traffic control centre yesterday.</p> <p>BA said the knock-on effect of flight chaos yesterday had forced it to ground several short-haul flights from its two main airports this morning. Services to Edinburgh, Paris, Brussels, Dublin and Venice were cancelled after planes were left in the wrong locations overnight.</p> <p>BA said that apart from today's cancellations its Heathrow and Gatwick operations were \"working normally\". A spokeswoman said BA would ask for a full investigation by Nats, the air traffic control group that operates Swanwick and is part-owned by BA.</p> <p>\"We will speak to Nats in order to get a better understanding of how it happened and get some reassurances that the causes are being looked at closely,\" she said.</p> <p>The worst affected airline yesterday was easyJet, which cancelled 60 flights. BA cancelled at least 35 services and Ryanair cancelled six. About 12,000 passengers were affected by the cancellations yesterday, with thousands more enduring delays after departures from all airports in the south-east were halted for 40 minutes from about 4pm.</p> <p>Richard Minnis, 26, an IT consultant from London, missed his flight to Cape Town last night after getting stuck in queues caused by the glitch. </p> <p>\"It has been a bit of a shambles really,\" he said. \"I missed my flight because the queue was so long to check in. When the problem started all the airport staff seemed to disappear. There was no information.\"</p> <p>Passengers described the situation in many airports yesterday as chaos. \"When the flight was cancelled everyone was herded to a desk manned by about four people, who were expected to deal with over a thousand passengers,\" said a businessman whose flight to Munich from Heathrow was cancelled.</p> <p>Easyjet said it had had no cancellations today and Ryanair said it was operating a full schedule, with the worst affected service a flight from Stansted that was delayed for five hours this morning.</p> <p>An easyJet spokesman said the airline decided to sacrifice flights yesterday to ensure a normal Friday schedule. \"Our aim is to, if necessary, go ugly on the first day in order to guarantee that the network works absolutely fine the next day.</p> <p>\"The particular iniquity in this is that under EU law it is airlines that have to put people into hotels and rebook flights. It is a lot of money for something completely out of our control.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for Nats said it was \"business as usual\" at Swanwick today. An investigation into what caused the computer failure was under way, the spokesman said. </p> <p>A temporary ban on take-offs at airports in south-east England was imposed after the computer failure, which impaired air traffic controllers' ability to monitor planes flying at more than 24,000 feet. </p> <p>Controllers had to type routine flight data, such as altitude and direction, into computer systems. Because this increased their workload, immediate limitations were put on the amount of planes that could use the airspace over London, resulting in a sudden decrease in take-offs.</p> <p>Ian Hall, the operational performance director of Nats, apologised to those affected and said safety had not been compromised at any stage. \"We handle nearly 2.5m flights a year and our systems are incredibly resilient. We take every step to avoid any problems but are always aware that in maintaining and updating highly complex systems we can experience difficulties.\"</p>",
  "<p>Six years ago, John Cole and Harry Sumnall from the University of Liverpool and Charles Grob, director of the division of child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of California, Los Angeles, had the temerity to suggest that some research on ecstasy might have been biased by <a href=\"http://www.liv.ac.uk/Psychology/staff/JCole/Sorted_Sep02Cole.pdf\">assumptions about its harm (pdf)</a>. </p> <p>Paul Betts, the father of Leah Betts, the teenager who died in 1995 after taking the drug, described their scholarly article as \"<a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2002/HEALTH/09/02/ecstasy.article/index.html\">despicable</a>\" and said: \"It has been proven beyond any shadow of a doubt that every single ecstasy tablet destroys parts of the brain\". </p> <p>The views of Betts, coloured by memories of his daughter's tragic death, carry enormous weight with many who fear the corrosive influence of illicit drugs on our society and who are desperate not to encourage their use. </p> <p>But ecstasy does not literally destroy the brain. Nor is it exceptionally toxic. In Britain the majority of those who have died were problem drug users, typically men in their late 20s, taking a cocktail of drugs. American records show that fewer people die using ecstasy than eating peanuts \u2013 one in a million users. If we based the law on individual catastrophes, we would ban peanuts. </p> <p>No drug (whether miraculous medical treatment, alcohol or heroin) is completely safe. To make sensible decisions about how to deal with drugs, we need reliable information about their risks. For prescription drugs, there is a regulatory framework aimed at minimizing harm. And in principle, we have an equally rigorous mechanism for specifying the dangers of illegal drugs. </p> <p>The 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act established the <a href=\"http://drugs.homeoffice.gov.uk/drugs-laws/acmd/\">Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs</a> (ACMD) \"to keep under review the situation in the United Kingdom with respect to drugs which are being or appear to them likely to be misused and of which the misuse is having or appears to them capable of having harmful effects\". The ACMD advises the government about the relative harm of drugs, and the resulting classification \u2013 A, B or C \u2013 determines the sentences imposed by courts. </p> <p>Unfortunately this admirable example of evidence-based policy is at<br>risk of being paralysed. </p> <p>In May, the ACMD advised that cannabis should not be moved back from C to B. But the Home Office and No 10 made it clear in advance that cannabis would be reclassified, because of concern about the \"message\" that had been sent by downgrading it to C in 2004. </p> <p>The ACMD is now reviewing the status of ecstasy, currently a Class A drug. Last year, a study <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6474053.stm\">published in the Lancet</a> (in which I was involved) asked panels of experts to gauge all the risks \u2013 to users and society \u2013 associated with 20 different drugs. Ecstasy had the lowest overall rating of all the illicit drugs \u2013 far less harmful than the iconic class A drugs, heroin and cocaine, and also lower than cannabis, which was itself ranked less harmful than tobacco or alcohol. The<br>resulting evidence-based scale of relative harm bore little resemblance to the current ranking of drugs in the A/B/C system. </p> <p>I don't know what the ACMD will recommend but, unless the evidence has changed dramatically, it is hard to believe that they will conclude that ecstasy ranks alongside crack cocaine. But if they recommend reclassification, all the signs are that the government will again reject their advice. </p> <p>Of course governments are entitled to express opinions about drug use.<br>Equally, they have to direct resources for policing, for education of young people and for healthcare. All of these actions should be based on knowledge of the different aspects of harm associated with drugs. But at present, the A/B/C system, designed to guide sentencing, is being constrained for other purposes. </p> <p>The obvious way forward is to institute a radical review of drug classification, which Charles Clarke briefly entertained when he was home secretary. The Commons <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/science_and_technology_committee.cfm\">select committee on science</a>, the <a href=\"http:// www.acmedsci.ac.uk\">Academy of Medical Sciences</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.thersa.org\">Royal Society of Arts</a>, and, most recently, the <a href=\"http://www.ukdpc.org.uk/index.shtml\">UK Drug Policy Commission</a> have all argued for such a review. It would minimise the amount of egg on faces and would reaffirm the government's commitment to evidence-based policy.</p>",
  "<p>When I was a baby critic I loved art and just wanted to write about it. I was shocked and puzzled that so many people I met who also spent their time talking, writing, thinking about art seemed motivated more by rage than love. A lot of art lovers seem to end up as furious art haters, railing against perceived wrongs. Art often appears to be about money and power, and inevitably those who brush against the materialist side of it can get pretty disgusted. But most of art's less attractive trappings are just that, trappings - to be angry is to make these illusions seem more real than they are. </p> <p>It's this distinct sense of bitterness that I detect again and again in the newsletters and campaigns of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuckism\">stuckists</a>. I just received a press release from <a href=\"http://www.stuckism.com/\">Stuckism International</a> saying that a stuckist lawyer, Leo Goatley, has written to the culture minister questioning the Tate's recent statement that Sir Nicholas Serota's seven-year contract no longer needs renewing and becomes a lifetime appointment. </p> <p>Goatley claims that in fact Serota's contract came up for renewal a month before the new legislation that permits this decision came into effect ... uh? What? You took the time to research that? </p> <p>Do the stuckists seriously think there would be any doubt about renewing the employment of the most successful museum director in the world? The man who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/may/13/art\">redrew the map of British art</a> and whose institution is so effective that - well, that it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/dec/11/arts.artsnews1\">creates enemies like this</a>? </p> <p>Look, the Tate is just a museum. Serota is just a man. If you don't like what you think it stands for just do your own thing, believe in it, be creative. Art is just that, isn't it? Being creative? The other stuff is just verbiage. Just go and do a painting. Enjoy yourselves. It's time for stuckism to be consigned to history. Don't worry it will never be forgotten - I'm sure it will all be meticulously documented, in the Tate archives.</p>",
  "<p>I serve on the <a href=\"http://budget.senate.gov/democratic/aboutsbc.html\">budget committee</a> in the US Senate, and prior to that served as a member of the banking committee of the House of Representatives. For the past seven years I have heard President George Bush and his administration tell us how \"robust\" the American economy was, and how all of its \"fundamentals\" were <a href=\"http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2007/08/bush_fundamentals_of_our_econo.html\">strong</a>. <br> That was until <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/09/19/business/main4459685.shtml\">a few days ago</a>. Now, suddenly, the American Congress \u2013 and the American nation \u2013 are being told that if Congress does not act immediately and approve a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/25/business/economy/25paulson.html\">$700bn Wall Street bailout proposal</a> that the Bush \"free marketeers\" have written up, there will be an unprecedented economic meltdown in the United States and an unraveling of the global economy. </p> <p>This proposal as presented is an unacceptable attempt to force the middle-income families of the United States to pick up the cost of fixing the horrendous economic mess that is the product of the Bush administration's deregulatory fever and Wall Street's insatiable greed. If the potential danger to the American economy was not so dire, this blatant effort to essentially transfer $700bn up the income ladder to those at the top would be laughable. </p> <p>Let me be clear. If the economy is on the edge of collapse, we need to act. But rescuing the American economy does not mean we have to just give away $700bn of taxpayer money to the banks. Unlike the Bush administration, I believe any proposal must protect middle-income and working families from bearing the burden of this bail-out. We must not redistribute wealth upward, to the financial houses and banks and the wealthy investors who control them.</p> <p>I have proposed to my colleagues in the US Senate a four-part plan to fund responsibly whatever bail-out is necessary.</p> <p>The first part is a progressive and reasonable distribution of fiscal responsibility: a five-year, 10% surtax on the income of individuals above $500,000 a year, and $1m a year for couples; a requirement that the price the government pays for any mortgage assets are discounted appropriately so that government can recover the amount it paid for them; and, finally, a programme to enable the US government to receive equity in the companies it bails out so that when the stock of these companies rises after the bailout, taxpayers have the opportunity to share in the resulting windfall. Taken together, these measures will provide the best guarantee that at the end of five years, the government will have gotten back the money it puts into the bail-out. </p> <p>Second, in addition to protecting the average American from being saddled with the cost, any serious proposal has to include reforms so that we end the type of behaviour that led to this crisis in the first place, a crisis that has endangered not only the American economy but the world economy. Much of what has gone wrong in the US can be traced to specific legislation that broke down regulatory safety walls in the financial sector, allowing banks and others to engage in new types of risky transactions that are at the heart of this crisis. That era of deregulation needs to be ended. Wall Street has shown it cannot be trusted to police itself. America needs to reinstate a strong regulatory system that protects our economy, and the economies of other nations that invest in American financial instruments.</p> <p>Third, the US needs to adopt some of the worker-oriented priorities of other nations so that it can address the needs of working families in our nation who are today facing very difficult times \u2013 and not just bankers and their partners in fiscal speculation. If we can bail out Wall Street, we need to respond with equal vigour to the plight of American workers and their families. That means, for example, creating millions of jobs through major investments in rebuilding the crumbling infrastructure of the US and in creating a new renewable energy system to address global warming. We must also make certain that we protect more than banks: we must make sure the most vulnerable Americans don't freeze in the winter or die because they lack access to primary healthcare. </p> <p>Finally, we need to protect the international financial system from being at the mercy of giant companies that are \"too big to fail,\" companies which are so large that their failure would cause systemic harm to either the American or the world economy. We need to assess which companies fall into this category and insist they are broken up. Otherwise, the American taxpayer will continue to be on the financial hook for the risky behaviour, the mismanagement, and even the illegal conduct of these companies' executives. Likewise, those who work in economies interlinked with the US economy \u2013 which in our 21st century global economy is every nation \u2013 must be protected from disruption because of irresponsible or wrong decisions by corporate executives in a place far from their own.</p> <p>These are the last days of the Bush administration, the most dishonest and incompetent presidency in modern American history. I believe that is imperative that, at this important moment, the US Congress stand up for the American middle class and for fiscal integrity. The future of the United States, and that of the global economy, is at stake.</p>",
  "<p>German police boarded a KLM flight at Cologne airport early this morning and arrested two men suspected of preparing a terrorist attack.</p> <p>Police refused to comment on whether the men - a 23-year-old Somali and a 24-year-old Somali-born German - were believed to have been planning an attack on the plane or in the Netherlands.</p> <p>They denied earlier reports that the plane had been stormed by special commando forces, but said they had been trailing the men for months. They were arrested after suicide notes were found in their Cologne flat saying they were acting in the name of jihad.</p> <p>Passengers were ordered to leave flight 1804 and asked to identify their luggage to check whether the two arrested men had bags with them. The plane took off an hour late and landed safely at Schipol airport in Amsterdam.</p> <p>The arrest of the men, who are being held in custody, comes as German authorities are on high alert for a German-born convert to Islam who is believed to have spent months training in terrorist camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p> <p>It is unknown if today's arrests are in any way connected. But authorities at border crossings across the country were told on September 20 to watch out for 21-year-old Eric Breininger, from Saarland, and two accomplices.</p> <p>The three are believed to be on their way back to Germany from Pakistan. They were last seen in the Bosnian town of Zenica just over a week ago. Breininger is known to have links to a suspected Islamist terror cell known as the Sauerland group, which planned car bomb attacks in Germany last year.</p> <p>If successful they would have been worse than the Madrid train bombings. Police arrested the alleged ringleader, Daniel Schneider, and other members on September 2 last year. Breininger, who police say considers Schneider as \"an older brother\", left Germany suddenly two days before the arrests. He went to Pakistan via Egypt and joined the Islamic Jihad Union in the Pakistani mountains, where he was trained in terrorist techniques.</p> <p>In May, a video showing Breininger brandishing a Kalashnikov and declaring his willingness to die for Allah appeared on the Internet, prompting police to say he was \"highly dangerous\" and \"willing to carry out a suicide attack\".</p> <p>Germany's federal criminal police agency, the BKA, has warned that the presence of around 3,000 German soldiers in Afghanistan has increased the risk of terrorist attacks on German soil.</p> <p>Germany is beginning to come to terms with the phrase \"home-grown terrorist\", having escaped a bomb attack that was planned on two trains from Cologne by two Islamist militants in 2006. The bombs failed to explode.</p> <p>On Tuesday, suspected Islamist militants were arrested for threatening to kill two police whom they lured into a side street in Cologne in an attempt to steal their guns.</p> <p>Security experts have warned that attacks on \"soft targets\" in Germany are likely. \"Since 2006 young Germans have been increasingly bombarded with al-Qaida propaganda and it's clear that terror cells are operating in Germany,\" Guido Steinberg, a terrorist expert at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, told the German news channel N24.</p> <p>\"We've seen similar attacks planned in Germany to those that have taken place in London and Madrid, on soft targets such as trains and buses. We have to expect similar attacks here.\"</p>",
  "<p>Everyone has to make tough decisions in life. Opting to take redundancy at The Argus in Brighton after 17 years' service was one of my most difficult.</p> <p>I agonised over it almost beyond the point of reason.<br></p> <p>Several sleepless nights were involved. I thought that it might open the door to a new challenge but felt the burden of responsibility to my dependents, my wife and student son. My wage packet hardly bulged and it was only some sanctioned freelance work that kept our heads above water in a tide of rising costs. </p> <p>I was also worried about whether the credit crunch - which hit newspapers years before it became fashionable - and my age would work against me. Would employment be out there for a dinosaur who had spent his whole working life in newspapers, specialising in sports writing and subbing? It appeared I was stuck between a rock and a hard place. </p> <p>Signs had been on the wall for years at The Argus. An evening paper for more than 120 years with around four editions, it had become a morning daily with just one. And it was attracting less and less advertising. The publication's future looked bleak.</p> <p>The environment reflected it, cranky old computers, cluttered desks, erratic air conditioning, popping bulbs and low morale in an open-plan office on a faceless industrial estate.</p> <p>Around 10 redundancies had been made about a year before and the same figure was touted during this latest round. More, many believed, were on the way by the end of the year.</p> <p>I will never forget the start of my process to departure - it was July's Black Friday, when the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2008/jul/16/jobsgoatbrightonargus\">staff was told by the editor </a>that redundancies were on the way with the publication of sister paper The Sports Argus - a weekly all-sports paper - due to cease.</p> <p>He told us he was unable to say how many, while inviting voluntary redundancies. He was also unable to say exactly when the axe would fall on TSA. </p> <p>The Argus NUJ branch - with FOC Tim Norman at the forefront - sought answers that weren't forthcoming. The rumour mill had it that two of the redundancies would come from the sports desk. After all, it was first in the firing line with the impeding demise of the sports paper. Most members of our desk had wives and children. One had a partner about to give birth. There was much disquiet.</p> <p>My decision to apply for \"voluntary\" - after consulting my family, the editor, personnel, the NUJ and colleagues - helped ease concern.</p> <p>I came to a settlement after the editor accepted my application and I left on August 22 this year. I hold no animosity towards him as I knew he was merely a front man for the cowardly bean counters concerned purely with money rather than any life-changing effects on staff.</p> <p>My mother-in-law wrote me a note saying that leaving The Argus could be \"the best thing that has happened to you for quite a while\". I believe that will eventually prove the case, because I'm self-motivated, resourceful, durable, experienced and talented.</p> <p>I've picked up work through contacts and putting out \"feelers\" for more while keeping an eye on the full-tie market. </p> <p>Onwards and upwards.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3033601.stm\">Dr Saeb Erekat</a>, in his role as chief negotiator for the Palestinian Authority, has seen plenty of Israeli promises broken during his tenure. Despite this, he clings to the belief that there will be a successful resolution to the decades-old conflict which will bring peace to his people as well as their Israeli counterparts. </p> <p>However, in the short term, his refusal to entertain the proposition that there will be no end to the hostilities doesn't prevent him condemning what he sees as a serious failure on behalf of both the Israeli government and the international community overseeing the peace process. \"Virtually every indicator \u2026 shows that Israeli has accelerated its settlement activity since <a href=\"http://www.theisraelproject.org/site/c.hsJPK0PIJpH/b.3589983/k.6537/Annapolis_Fast_Facts_V.htm\">Annapolis</a>,\" he said this week, \"while we have proven our commitment to our obligations under phase 1 of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_map_for_peace\">road map</a>.\" </p> <p>Presaging the heavy criticism levelled against the Quartet this week by <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/applications/blogs/pressoffice/?p=1687\">a coalition of aid agencies</a>, Erekat also stressed that the Quartet was falling well short in its role of compelling the Israeli government to adhere to the road map's requirements. \"Experience of the past year has shown that [the Quartet's] mechanism needs to be coupled with stronger enforcement of road map compliance by the Quartet and the broader international community.\"</p> <p>I met Erekat on the eve of his departure for the US, where he is part of the Palestinian delegation attending the UN General Assembly's 63rd session. Sitting in his Jericho office, he began on a note of cautious optimism in relation to Tzipi Livni's <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1024167.html\">successful bid</a> to become leader of Israel's Kadima party the day before. \"She's a very eligible person,\" he said.</p> <blockquote> <p>She's a tough negotiator, and she's determined to serve the interests of her country, as much as I'm determined to serve the interests of my people; and we need it. As Palestinians, we need peace, and I think the Israelis also need peace.</p> </blockquote> <p>However, he was quick to point out that the Kadima primaries were \"an internal Israeli matter\", and that who was at the helm of the Israeli government concerned him far less than whether the final agreement signed between the two sides was \"fair \u2026 and based on international law\". He maintained that, in spite of the clear evidence that Israel has frequently flouted \u2013 and continues to flout \u2013 various agreements signed over recent years, he has not lost faith that, in the end, he will be able to deliver peace to his people, noting that \"there [has been] a genuine movement on the path of identification of needs and interests\" of late. </p> <p>At the same time, he did concede that the post-Annapolis climate does not indicate that the Israeli authorities are ready to deliver on their promises in the short term, as was meticulously detailed in the aid agencies' damning report. \"Those who go the path of settlements are not ready to reach an agreement; they undermine the peace process. Settlements and peace don't go together: either we continue with settlements and shut up about the two-state solution, or speak about the two-state solution and shut the work on settlements.\"</p> <p>Referring to the current conditions under which his people are forced to live in the West Bank, he had harsh words for the occupying power.</p> <blockquote> <p>Our [cities] are big prisons; [there are] roads that I cannot use, as a Christian or Muslim Palestinian. Never in the darkest hours of South Africa's apartheid history were blacks prevented from using roads that whites were using.</p> </blockquote> <p>Decrying the status quo as being motivated by \"bigotry and racism\", he was nevertheless adamant that the Israeli policies would ultimately fail, since \"I did not vanish, I did not disappear, and I do not intend to,\" assuring me that his refusal to throw in the towel will force the Israelis to deal with him on level terms in the future. </p> <p>He also laid blame at the feet of the international community for failing to intervene on his people's behalf, noting that \"had there been any sense of fairness and justice, we would not have been in this situation for the last 41 years.\" Referring to the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7636288.stm\">Quartet's apparent failure</a> to properly enforce the binding Annapolis agreement, he commented: \"It's been nine months since these international mechanisms, and they're yet to issue a paper \u2026 saying who's doing and who's not doing.\" The aid agencies agreed with his assessment, noting that \"negotiations have reportedly been close to collapse because of [the Quartet's failure to take action]\". On top of that, Erekat noted that \"Europe has not been able to stop importing from settlements in [the] occupied territories,\" a failure which he sees as \"a violation of international law\". </p> <p>I put it to him that time was not on the Palestinians' side, given that with every passing year, and every new settlement built, the facts on the ground pointed to a solidifying of the occupation and a sign that the Israeli authorities were deaf to the hopes and dreams of the Palestinian people. Erekat replied that I should \"rethink and reassess\", since in his opinion, time was one element firmly in his favour. </p> <blockquote> <p>I can't lose belief. I'm a Palestinian living in this country, I live in the home in which I was born, my children are Palestinians. My children are more Palestinian than me in terms of nationalism. I was 12 years old when the Israeli occupation came to my home town Jericho. I became a father under occupation; last week, I became a grandfather under occupation \u2026 I'm defeated if my son seeks a job in London, or in Amman, or Dubai. My victory is realised if my son can find a job here in Jericho, or in east Jerusalem, Nablus, or Gaza.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the face of all the duplicity he sees on the part of Israel and the international community, Erekat is adamant that the will of his people is still to reach an agreement based on a two-state solution. \"Seventy percent plus of the Palestinian people do support my line of a two-state solution,\" he stated firmly. \"Sometimes they get angry \u2026 at me and they accuse me of failure; not because I made an agreement, but because I failed to make an agreement. They want the agreement. They want the two-state solution.\" </p> <p>However, given Israel's undeniable failure to adhere to either the Annapolis agreement \u2013 as highlighted in the aid agencies' report \u2013 or to any other preceding deals signed between the two sides, it appears that the Palestinians will have a long wait coming before their dream is finally realised.</p>",

  "<h2>How much could I get?</h2> <p>Pension credit is split into two parts: a guaranteed credit element and a savings credit element. The guaranteed part tops up a single pensioner's income to \u00a3124.05 a week and a pensioner couple's income to \u00a3189.35 a week., If your income is below this, you could be entitled to make a claim. If, for example, you live alone and your only income is the full state pension (\u00a390.70 a week), you could be entitled to an extra \u00a333.35 a week.</p> <p>The second part, the savings credit, is designed to reward people who have moderate amounts put away for their retirement by providing a small amount of cash on top of the income generated by their private savings. </p> <p>An individual can have a weekly income of up to \u00a3174 from a combination of state pension and private savings and still qualify for pension credit of up to \u00a319.71 a week. A couple can have income of \u00a3255 and claim a savings credit of up to \u00a326.13. </p> <h2>Do I qualify?</h2> <p>You have to be 60 or over to qualify for the guaranteed part of pension credit, and at least 65 for the savings credit. To check that you do qualify, and how much you might get, try using the <a href=\"http://www.thepensionservice.gov.uk/pensioncredit/calculator/calculate.asp\">calculator</a> on the pensions service website - you will need some details to hand, like how much your home costs you each week.</p> <h2>Why don't more people apply?</h2> <p>According to the Department of Work and Pensions, 4.4 million pensioners are entitled to claim pension credit but up to 1.8 million have so far failed to register, missing out on an average of \u00a31,477 a year.</p> <p>Age Concern says many are deterred by the 35-page application document, or the stigma of applying for a means-tested benefit. Others simply don't realise they could be entitled to extra cash each week.</p> <p>The process is set to get easier on October 6, when pensioners will be able to claim pension credit, housing benefit and council tax credit in one telephone call. </p> <h2>How can I apply?</h2> <p>Application forms for pension credit can be ordered by calling the Pension Credit Line on 0800 991234, or they can be <a href=\"http://www.thepensionservice.gov.uk/pdf/pensioncredit/pc1apr08-print.pdf \">downloaded</a> from the Pension Service's website. </p> <p>Age Concern branches also stock the forms and will help you fill them in.

  "<p>Where would we be without transport? What would we do without cars, buses, trains and aeroplanes?

Similarly the topic as applied to politics, economics and the oil industry is possibly one for another day, another blog, and certainly another writer.</p> <p>I mean in terms of television.

Speaking of tragic, I just found myself on the <a href=\" http://www.thomasandfriends.com/usa/index.asp?origref=\">US version of the Thomas site</a> when looking at this. It was disquieting. Beware.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"http://www.onthebusesfanclub.co.uk/\">On the Buses</a></strong>: Not a TV show that could happen now. Mainly because it would be quite dull to watch the driver of a bus bantering with themself, having no conductor to riff off. Not that that normally stops them, of course.</p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/\">Top Gear</a></strong>: Unthinkable without cars, obviously. The gentlemen presenters and their guests would be reduced to actually taking their willies out and waving <em>them</em> about instead. And that wouldn't do at all. Not on the BBC. </p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playdays\">Playbus</a></strong>: Of course, interestingly, this DID exist without the \"bus\", at least in name, after 1989, when in a tragic accident the Why Bird, drunk on overripe orange squash, smashed through the windscreen and caused the Playbus to overturn, running over Peggy the rag doll. Who was of course fine until someone tore her to shreds to use as a tourniquet. </p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/index.html\">Star Trek</a></strong>: I'm really not sure that should count. But an associate is insisting upon it, and a spaceship <em>is</em> a mode of transport, and granted, without it, they'd all just be floating about in space waiting for their oxygen tanks to run out. And that would be a very dull show indeed. Though quite meditative. Like aquarium TV. Or one of those <a href=\"http://www.catdvd.com/commercial.html\">Cat DVDs</a>. You know the ones. </p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/jun/18/top10.travelfoodanddrink\">The Hairy Bikers</a></strong>: Without the bikes they'd just be \"The Hairy\", which sounds like a bad B-Movie, or \"Hairy Chefs\", which for some reason sounds even more unappetising than the original.</p> <p><strong>9. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_A-Team\">The A-Team</a></strong>: Sure, they could have functioned without the van, but they would have had to walk or rely on public transport, and by the time they got to you you may not have had a problem OR needed help anymore. </p> <p><strong>10. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mv7mlUT_rI\">The High Life</a></strong>: Admittedly almost certainly the best thing about it was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mv7mlUT_rI&amp;feature=related\">the theme tune</a>. The series crashed and burned after <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_High_Life_(TV_series)\">one season</a>. That's a reference for about nine people, probably. Oh dearie me.</p> <p>Now. Obviously there are FAR more obvious ones than that. And that is where it is your turn, because it is Friday. What might they be, please?</p> <p>On your flags, ladies and gentlemen. GO.</p>",
  "<p>The culture secretary, Andy Burnham, said today that the government would make decisions about the future of public service broadcasting in January.</p> <p>Burnham said public service broadcasting was not \"fatally damaged\" and pledged that the government would announce its decisions and implementation strategy on the future of PSB at the start of next year.</p> <p>Making the keynote speech at the Royal Television Society digital media conference, the minister said that there was a \"real urgency to set a timetable\" about the future of PSB provision in the UK.</p> <p>\"I think it is right that we should be stepping up the pace in the interests of viewers and the whole of the television industry,\" he said.</p> <p>\"That is why the government and Ofcom will be working on a twin track approach, looking at policy options and practicalities upon which I need to decide.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/25/ofcom.itv\" target=\"_blank\">Ofcom published its second review of public sector broadcasting yesterday</a> and intends to make a final statement in \"early 2009\" with the expectation being January, after the closure of a consultation period on December 4.</p> <p>\"Early in the new year Ofcom can conclude its review and government can announce decisions and the process to implement those decisions,\" Burnham said. </p> <p>During a question-and-answer session the Channel 4 chief executive, Andy Duncan, said that there was \"no reserved time\" for legislation to go through government. He queried if implementation may be held up for several more years.</p> <p>\"It is the final phase, the end game of the debate, the time is now to make decisions,\" Burnham said in response to Duncan. \"Then those decisions will need to be enacted \u2026 It is not always the case that a flagship [communications] bill is what is needed.\"</p> <p>Under questioning from journalists at the end of the session about the realistic chances that the government could move quickly once decisions are announced in January, Burnham said: \"Clearly this is a priority to the government. The government is clearly signalling that there needs to be swift movement. It is a big statement [today] to say that we are ready to move with that speed.\"</p> <p>When asked about the logistics of freeing up public money to fund public service broadcasting on commercial TV networks, he said that the Department for Culture Media and Sport was in dialogue with the Treasury.</p> <p>However, several times during the speech and the question-and-answer session, Burnham seemed to push away the focus from using public funding to pay for future public service broadcasting, one of the options floated by Ofcom.</p> <p>\"All options are open at the moment, but it is important that we are all prepared to accept we have to make trade-offs,\" he said. \"There are no presumptions at this stage about the outcome, or about the nature or level of future intervention - and certainly no presumption about any future level or use of the licence fee.\"</p> <p>The Conservative party attacked Burnham's speech.</p> <p>\"When the financial difficulties of many of our major broadcasters are so great and investment in original UK produced content is under threat it is extremely disappointing that the culture secretary doesn't address the substantive issues raised by Ofcom's report,\" said shadow culture secretary Jeremy Hunt. </p> <p>\"A review of listed sports events is fine but what does he think about the future of ITV regional news or the need for a strong Channel 4? On these issues we're completely in the dark.\"</p> <p>Burnham said, during his speech, that one key tenet of government working toward a solution with industry was \"people in the TV industry not overstating the threat\".</p> <p>This was taken by some to indicate that the government was not particularly keen to seek public funds to fill the black hole of costs facing TV companies. Ofcom estimates that, by 2012, to maintain public service broadcast content levels outside the BBC, up to \u00a3235m a year will be needed. </p> <p>Burnham, answering questions from the floor after his keynote speech, said that it would be a \"fatal error\" if the focus now moved to solely on to ploughing more money into supporting public service broadcasting.</p> <p>\"That would be a fatal error, I would be disappointed. The key argument I was putting across today is whatever value there is in public service broadcasting should be put into quality and standards ... if that is done then there will be commercial value. It would disappoint me if the [only] response from the industry to the Ofcom consultation is more money.\"</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>The disclosure (in today's Guardian) that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/25/iran.israelandthepalestinians1\">George Bush vetoed an Israeli plan</a> to attack Iran's nuclear sites earlier this year may turn out to be the best decision in his eight-year term. It is easy to deride this president and there is much to deride him for, but when he does the right thing it deserves to be applauded.</p> <p>He has had an abysmal record as commander-in-chief. His decision to launch an all-out attack on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan\">Afghanistan</a> after 9/11 rather than using special forces and Pakistan's intelligence agencies in a hunt for Osama Bin Laden that would be limited to Tora Bora was the first blunder. The Taliban were no threat to the United States or the rest of the world, and there was no strategic need to overthrow them. In the event, the invasion of Afghanistan did not even achieve what should have been the primary goal of US policy, the capture of Osama and the undermining of al-Qaida. It was using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, without even hitting the nut.</p> <p>The invasion of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq\">Iraq</a> was Bush's second military blunder. It gave al-Qaida a new lease of life and a fresh platform for attacks on Americans, as well as damaging US prestige throughout the Middle East and much of the rest of the world. </p> <p>More recently, we have the US decision to start air strikes inside Pakistan against the will of the newly-elected civilian government, apparently in a desperate bid to try to kill Osama in the last weeks of Bush's term. Revenge, and the search for a scalp that can be trumpeted as an administration triumph, have overcome common sense. </p> <p>Finally, there is the foolish US policy of arming and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/05/georgia.nato\">supporting</a> Georgia's puffed-up president Mikheil Saakashvili, who turned a frozen border conflict into all-out war and provoked the first real danger of an east-west military confrontation in Europe since the end of the cold war. Even now when Saakashvili's recklessness has been exposed, Bush and his closest allies refuse to rebuke him.</p> <p>Against this background, Bush's sobriety on the use of force against Iran stands out as remarkable. It reflects the debates which were racking the Pentagon and White House this spring after the National Intelligence Estimate came out with the conclusion that Iran had stopped its nuclear weapons programme in 2003. The debate had its casualties, not least the <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/03/11/mideast/pent.php\">early retirement of Admiral William Fallon</a>, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and a known dove on the issue. But the ultimate winner was the intelligent pragmatism of the US defence secretary Robert Gates, who realised what the effects of an Israeli attack would be.</p> <p>Retired <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/id/160089\">General John Abizaid</a>, who was head of US Central Command until 2007, put it well in Newsweek recently. He doubted whether \"the Israelis have the capability to make a lasting impression on the Iranian nuclear programme with their military capabilities,\" and said an attack on Iran would be \"bad for the region, bad for the United States [and would] ultimately move the region into an even more unstable situation.\"</p> <p>Bush himself, according to today's Guardian report, warned Olmert with a similar message. He told them they would not be able to disable Iran's nuclear programme without launching a full-scale war, and provoking a reaction against American interests in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the US homeland itself.</p> <p>Thank you, George. The dying weeks of your presidency will indeed be marked by a triumph \u2013 on one condition. You must publicise your new strategy. Telling Olmert privately not to provoke a regional conflagration is a huge benefit, and no successor to Olmert is likely to take such dangerous action without prior US approval. But it would do even more good if you make your change of policy clear. Make a speech in which you announce unambiguously that the standard formula on Iran \u2013 \"All options remain on the table\" \u2013 no longer applies. Tell the world \"The military option is off the table\", except in the unlikely event that Iran itself starts an attack on Israel or the US. For the US or Israel to start a war because Iran may be trying to build a nuclear bomb, or even has succeeded in building one, cannot be justified.</p> <p>Regrettably, neither McCain nor Obama have been willing to take that position. They both stick to the \"all options\" formula. Bush can be innovative. He has already shown the wisdom and courage to veto Israel's plans for attack. It doesn't take much extra courage to go public and take credit for his veto.</p>",
  "<p>Air passengers face further delays today because of a computer failure in Britain's main air traffic control system.</p> <p>British Airways had to cancel some domestic and short-haul European flights from Heathrow this morning after airspace was shut down across the south-east yesterday afternoon.</p> <p>A BA spokesman said: \"Some of our planes are in the wrong location due to yesterday's cancellations, but the flights we've had to cancel today are all on multi-frequency routes and we are not experiencing any delays to other services.\"</p> <p>Minor delays have been reported at other airports this morning, with services generally returning to normal.</p> <p>Dozens of flights were cancelled and hundreds more delayed across the country yesterday, leaving more than 10,000 passengers stranded. At least 88 flights were cancelled at London's main airports, while flights were affected at Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Cardiff International and Manchester.</p> <p>The computer problem forced Nats, the company that runs the control centre, to restrict the number of planes entering UK airspace as well as those taking off from several major airports. </p> <p>Ian Hall, the operational performance director of Nats, apologised to those affected and said safety had not been compromised at any stage.</p> <p>\"We handle nearly 2.5m flights a year and our systems are incredibly resilient. We take every step to avoid any problems but are always aware that in maintaining and updating highly complex systems we can experience difficulties.\"</p> <p>The company said the computer failure affected the monitoring of flights at higher altitude, meaning no planes could cross the south-east at more than 24,000 feet.</p> <p>Air traffic controllers had to increase the distance between flights and enter flight data manually. For 40 minutes there were no departures and a limited number of arrivals at all airports in south-east England.</p> <p>Nats is part-owned by a consortium of airlines including BA and easyJet.

  "<p><strong> The hottest hot chocolate</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.taste-of-scotland.com/members/ptarmigan_restaurant.html\">The Ptarmigan restaurant</a>, on Cairngorm mountain, makes a mean hot chocolate.</p> <p><strong> The ultimate lunch stop on the mountain</strong> <br>Again, it has to be Ptarmigan restaurant. It's the highest restaurant in the UK, just beneath the peak and you have to ride the Cairngorm Mountain Railway funicular up to it. On a good day, you can see all the way to Ben Nevis on the West Coast. It is very beautiful. The food is locally sourced. </p> <p><strong>Apr\u00e8s beer time</strong> <br>The <a href=\"http://www.hilton.co.uk/property/1201_Restaurant.jsp?vid=11499144&amp;hid=11001807\">Woodshed Bar</a> at the Coylumbridge Hotel has made a big comeback in the last few years. This is a traditional ski bar with a history for apres ski dating back to the 70s and has seen many an alpine party night. There will be an especially good atmosphere if there has been an event on up the mountain, so make sure to check the event calendar when you are up<br>there.</p> <p><strong>Top of the slopes:</strong> <br>My favorite run on Cairngorm is actually Aladdins Couloir, which is a steep and narrow off-piste run to the west of the Head Wall. It is one of the best free-ride runs I have ever done if the snow is good. It was epic in March this year. Proper powder face shots all the way! The snowpark on the Ptarmigan piste is a lot of fun as well.</p> <p><strong>My word of advice:</strong> <br>Avoid the crowds by going to The Cairngorm backcountry. The backcountry opportunities just out of bounds of the Cairngorm resort are amazing. Get a guide for the day and be prepared to be blown away by the scope for adventure. Especially if the snow conditions are anything close to last March and April (see picture). There are numerous mountain guiding operations to chose from, but I recommend <a href=\"http://www.g2outdoor.co.uk/\">G2 Outdoor</a>, in Aviemore, who will both entertain your group and take you to the best snow and conditions to suit your ability.</p> <h2>Getting there</h2> <p>The Caledonian Sleeper leaves London Euston at 9.15pm and arrives in Aviemore at 7.40am. <a href=\"http://www.firstgroup.com/uktrain/\"> First</a>.

  "<p>Today marks the 20th anniversary of the publication of Salman Rushdie's novel, <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1DF163FF93AA25753C1A96E948260\">The Satanic Verses</a>.</p> <p>At the time, extracts from the novel were circulated by some Islamic organisations to mosques and Islamic societies across the country to help acquaint British Muslims with its contents. </p> <p>I was in my second year at university and could not comprehend why someone like Rushdie, who had been brought up in a Muslim family, would write a provocative novel that he must have known would cause offence to millions of people. </p> <p>Why constantly refer to the Prophet Muhammad as Mahound, the old medieval name for the devil? And to have a group of prostitutes in a brothel to take on the names of the prophet's wives in order to better arouse their clients \u2013 what was Rushdie thinking? </p> <p>There can be no real doubt that Rushdie was aware that his book would spark a huge controversy. A clearly tongue-in-cheek passage in The Satanic Verses has a character being told, \"Your blasphemy, Salman, can't be forgiven \u2026 to set your words against the word of God.\"</p> <p>We are all familiar with what happened next. A series of demonstrations were organised calling for the book to be withdrawn from circulation \u2013 you may recall that the then Tory government had tried to do the same with Peter Wright's Spycatcher just a couple of years previously. There were a couple of infamous book-burnings. Some Muslim organisations called for the blasphemy law to be extended to cover more than just the Anglican faith. The protests against the book soon spread to Muslim majority countries. Then came Feb 14 1989 and Ayatollah Khomeini's dramatic intervention from Iran calling upon Muslims everywhere to <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE0DF153FF936A25751C0A96F948260\">kill Rushdie</a> for the crime of insulting the prophet. </p> <p>Just over a year ago, I wrote a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/19/notsurprisinglytheawarding\">Cif piece</a> arguing that it was time to admit that those of us who had called for the book to be banned or pulped were wrong. Utterly wrong. It was understandable why many regarded and still do regard passages in The Satanic Verses to be so offensive, but that could not be used as a justification to try and prevent others from reading the book. </p> <p>My piece got a mixed reaction from the Muslims I spoke to. Some agreed that the episode had been a disaster while others strongly disagreed with me and did not accept that a novelist should have the \"right to offend\". I tried to explain that the right to offend did not imply that one agreed with what was being said \u2013 it was just that the writer should not be prevented from doing so as long as he was not breaking any laws.</p> <p>This year I decided to send an email to members of one national Muslim organisation asking them for their own views on the matter. Here are excerpts from some of the responses that I received:</p> <blockquote> <p>You cannot force people to respect you and it has resulted in the exact opposite reaction with all sorts of people lining up to insult and lampoon the prophet, Islam, the Qur'an and Muslims generally in the last two decades since.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>I was 16 years old at the time and was perplexed over the issue. I knew that Rushdie had written an offensive book, but I found the Muslim protestors' response somewhat offensive too.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The late Zaki Badawi was right all along to say he would offer his home as a sanctuary for his fellow citizen Salman when the death penalty and its bounty was declared ... I think years later, many of us who would admit to having hurled abuse at Badawi then, have relearned and rethought about loyalty, citizenship, freedom and social responsibility.</p> </blockquote> <p>It may be notable that I did not receive a single response arguing that the protestors were right to have called for The Satanic Verses to be pulped or withdrawn. </p> <p>Is this rethinking now widespread amongst British Muslims? Yes, my impression is that it certainly is with many now accepting that the Satanic Verses affair served to create (and for others reinforce) the unfortunate view that Muslims were backward, anti-intellectual, prone to violence and saw themselves as being somehow above the law.</p> <p>In a 1990 essay entitled \"<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=gRyoAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22In+Good+Faith%22+rushdie&amp;dq=%22In+Good+Faith%22+rushdie&amp;ei=hrbbSKHWKpekiwHMkJDoDg&amp;pgis=1\">In Good Faith</a>\", Rushdie tried to explain his reasons behind writing the Satanic Verses. Rushdie argued that he and his book had been consistently misrepresented but also asked:</p> <blockquote> <p>What is freedom of expression? Without the freedom to offend, it ceases to exist. Without the freedom to challenge, even to satirise all orthodoxies, including religious orthodoxies, it ceases to exist. Language and the imagination cannot be imprisoned, or art will die, and with it, a little of what makes us human.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is painful to admit it, but on the need to uphold the freedom to offend, Rushdie was right. The consequences of not doing so should be apparent by now to Muslims above all. </p> <p>Earlier this year, the leader of the far right Dutch Freedom Party, <a href=\"http://www.religionnewsblog.com/18971/quran\">Geert Wilders</a>, called for the Qur'an to be banned because he found some passages in the book offensive. </p> <p>And there's the rub. Who is to decide what is offensive or not? What may be offensive to me may be just harmless fun to you and vice versa. </p> <p>Some months back I had dinner with a well-known British columnist who has some rather strident views about immigration and Islam. I asked him outright what it was that so annoyed him about Islam and he said it was what he viewed as the seemingly constant attempts by Muslims to try and restrict freedoms.</p> <p>And regrettably, like it or not, that is the image too many people now have of Muslims.</p> <p>Last month a fresh controversy broke out over the proposed publication of the novel, Jewel of Medina, which is said to be about the Prophet Muhammad's relationship with his youngest wife, Aisha. The book has been described as a \"soft-porn\" novel and is now due to be published by <a href=\"http://www.gibsonsquare.com/\">Gibson Square</a> in the UK next month. </p> <p>Already emails are being circulated calling on British Muslim organisations to mobilise to try and stop its publication. Will they try and do so? I really hope that appropriate lessons have been learned from the Satanic Verses affair and that British Muslims do not take the bait. </p> <p>As per Islamic tradition, I have spent this month of Ramadan re-reading and studying the Qur'an. It is an unfailingly joyous experience. Every time I read it I marvel at the achievements of the Prophet Muhammad. He was the restorer of a pristine monotheism, blessedly free from the confusing Christian doctrine of the trinity and the narrow Hebrew tribalism of Judaism. His revolution in Arabia changed the course of human history and launched the Arabs on to the world stage for the first time. </p> <p>The point I am trying to make is that his achievements are by no means diminished simply because of the writings of Rushdie or the Jewel of Medina author, Sherry Jones. </p> <p>The Qur'an records the prophet being vilified as a \"madman\" and a \"sorcerer\" by his pagan opponents. The Qur'an consoled the prophet against these taunts and urged him to be patient while assuring him that \"soon you will see and they will see which of you is afflicted with madness\" (chapter 68, verses 5-6). </p> <p>Let Rushdie, Jones and co write as they please. Muslims are likewise at liberty to use those very same freedoms to promote their own understanding of the mission of the Prophet Muhammad. </p> <p>So what will happen when the Jewel of Medina is published next month? If the views articulated by my correspondents now constitute the majority view amongst British Muslims then that would be a hopeful sign.</p>",
  "<p>We're not sure whether authorities listened to our suggestion of a musical Interpol (Minterpol?) to track down equipment thieves, but there was nevertheless a victory this week for musical law and order. Peter Buck's stolen Rickenbacker guitar has been returned, allowing REM to continue sounding the way they always have. </p> <p>Buck's guitar went missing after a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/11/rem.instrument.stolen\">Helsinki concert</a> on September 9. The band made a public plea for its return, promising a \"generous\", \"no questions asked\" reward. Buck played the Rickenbacker 360 on everything from REM's 1982 debut, Chronic Town, to this year's Accelerate album. </p> <p>\"It's great to have it back in my hands,\" Buck said in a statement earlier this week. \"I'm looking forward to playing it tonight in Luxembourg.\"</p> <p>Bertis Downs, REM's manager, echoed the sentiment. \"We were always hopeful it would turn up, and thanks to the efforts of a lot of people, we are thrilled to have it back in Peter's possession,\" he said. \"We are grateful and very happy that it worked out this way.\"</p> <p>The band said in a statement that it was returned by an \"anonymous source\", but there is no official word whether the reward was paid out.</p>",
  "<p>News of the proposals to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/25/anglicanism.catholicism1\">abolish the Act of Settlement</a> \u2013 which in turn might trigger a move towards full disestablishment of the Church of England \u2013 come at an opportune moment for the <a href=\"http://www.secularism.org.uk\">National Secular Society</a>. The question becomes \u2013 what kind of constitution would follow?</p> <p>Naturally we would favour a constitution with secularism at its heart.</p> <p>Secularism is not a party political idea, it is not about promoting atheism or denying the right of religious people to fully participate in democracy.</p> <p>This is something we will be trying to put over at the <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=party.event.detail.page&amp;obj_id=140020\">Tory party conference</a> this weekend, where we have a stand for the first time in our 140-year history. We won't be asking Christian Tories to join the National Secular Society (which is, after all, an organisation of non-believers campaigning for secularism, not a bunch of atheists trying to destroy religion). But we will asking them to consider democratic secularism as a neutral concept that will ultimately protect everyone's rights, believer and unbeliever alike. We will be doing it under the banner of \"Secularism: the next big idea\".</p> <p>Secularism recognises religion and protects its independence, while at the same time ensuring that the domain of politics remains free from sectarian dominance. </p> <p>Those democratic countries with secular constitutions offer all religions the protection that frees them to pursue their faith in the way that they wish. The United States constitution, for instance, forbids both state interference in the affairs of religion and religious interference in affairs of state. The wise architects of the American constitution foresaw the dangers, both for the church and for the state, of allowing one church to become established by law. This did not restrict religion, but allowed it to flourish freely. </p> <p>The forefathers also saw the dangers of an established church or religion for the liberties and equality of those outside that religion. It is clear that the US constitution succeeds in its aim of giving religion \u2013 all religions without fear or favour\u2013 the freedom to make their case, and pursue their aims, in any way they wish. Religion is strong in America, but no single religion or denomination has direct control over state mechanisms. Religious voices are heard loud and clear, and their influence is felt in the corridors of power. But no religion has any ultimate sanction in sphere of temporal politics. <br> In France, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La%C3%AFcit%C3%A9\">laicism</a> \u2013 another form of secularism \u2013 also ensures that religion is protected from state meddling. But it also protects the state from religious demands for privilege. Under the French constitution, all are citizens, free and equal, and a particular religious allegiance brings no special rights. This ensures that all citizens, of whatever religion or none, have an equal opportunity for self-determination. The state is blind to a citizen's religion or belief, so all have an equal place in the secular space we all are obliged to share as citizens. </p> <p>However fond many are of the Church of England, and however grateful for the contribution it has made to British culture, we must face the reality that Britain is no longer a mono-faith society. Britain is becoming perhaps the most religiously diverse country in the world. </p> <p>As these religions become more assertive, religious conflict becomes more likely within our shores. We have something to learn from the two great democratic and secular societies of the US and France \u2013 secularism as a way forward to minimise these tensions. </p> <p>If conflict in this area is to be avoided, the playing field must be made level. And if the Church of England is to revive itself, it must be free of state restraints. It is our belief that the Church of England should be disestablished. </p> <p>A new British constitution should be written to reflect the reality of our lives in this country in the 21st century. In order to ensure that whatever our cherished religion or belief is, we can continue to hold it in peace, we need to accept that the religion or belief of others must also be accommodated, that their beliefs are precious to them, too. </p> <p>A secular society is one in which we can all live relatively peaceably and in equality. What we make of our lives will be up to us, but no one should be favoured or disadvantaged by dint of what they do or do not believe. </p> <p>Secularism is indeed a Conservative value. It is a Labour and Liberal value, too. It is a vital addition to any democracy. Other states in Europe with an established church, such as Sweden and Norway, are in the process of disestablishment. They do not see this as an anti-religious development and, indeed, the Lutheran church has endorsed the process.</p> <p>It is time for Britain to make its move into the modern, globalised world, in which diversity and variety are embraced, while the foundations of our state, our democracy and our liberty, are solidified and secured. </p> <p>Acceptance of the reality of our changing society will help us thrive together, rather than be at constant loggerheads about whose faith is more important and whose religion will have most privilege. Free from the conflict that chips away at our social cohesion, we will all enjoy our personal liberties, our mutual tolerance and freedom of faith and conscience. </p> <p>I don't know how the delegates at the conference will take this message. But I hope \u2013 for all our sakes \u2013 that they will at least give it a hearing.</p>",

  "<p>Most British actors can't do action movies.

Jas stomps through the melee with a pitbull's decorum, pausing only to snap a sharp one-liner into the explosion that used to be his adversary. It's the kind of thing that Schwarzenegger was great at before he went (sort of) <a href=\" http://www.hedgewoodcats.com/images/Last_Action_Hero.jpg\">postmodern</a>. </p> <p>Outside the UK, Statham's as much of a big hitter off-screen as on. The <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/2656156/Hollywood-turns-to-British-actors-like-Jason-Statham-and-Christian-Bale-for-action-men.html\">dearth of young, macho leading men</a> in Hollywood has seen his popularity boom over there, where his biggest action movie, The Transporter 2 (2005), took $43m at the box office. Here it grossed less than \u00a31m, a sad fact when you consider that, while the Knightleys and McAvoys of our film industry always have another costume drama to fall back on should their forays into other genres fail, Statham is effectively the lone British gun in a field dominated by the Americans.</p> <p><a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/jul/29/actionandadventure\">Death Race</a>, Statham's latest big'n'loud'n'stupid flick, is out in the UK tomorrow. Our filmgoers will probably remain indifferent (I can't see it doing anywhere near the $33m it made at the US box office) but it will be another instance of Statham breaking his way into a film genre where traditionally the Brit is simply <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1Qdkmu6Oeo\">the baddie</a> and there's as much value in that as there is in seeing Keira harping on about \"the concept of freedom\" in another ridiculous wig.</p>",
  "<p>The trio of Ofcom grandees, who unveiled proposals allowing ITV to savage its regional news, were pretty snappy under fire at their press conference yesterday and you can see why.</p> <p>They are trapped in a maze of contradictions and feeling pretty impotent.<br><br>They trumpet their mission in this public service broadcasting review, to recommend to government how quality can be maintained. But the reality is their influence is so limited that they fall back on the defence it's the system that is broken. And, in what sometimes seems like a displacement exercise, they propose future solutions.</p> <p>But what about the system of regulation that allowed this to happen? As I sat in the press conference I thought back to Jocelyn Hay, the outgoing consumer champion, chair of the Voice of the Listener &amp; Viewer who said bitterly in a recent Media Guardian interview that the public had been \"hoodwinked\" over assurances that the 2003 Communications Act would preserve the best of the old system.</p> <p>Ofcom spells out that it has only limited scope to protect children's programmes in \"the absence of a statutory basis to set quotas\". I don't think this is what the public thought they were getting.</p> <p>Let's get real and say light touch regulation hasn't worked very well in the global banking system, and it does not seem to be working very well for viewers in key media sectors either.</p> <p>The unions, the NUJ and Bectu are rightly protesting about the \u00a340m a year that ITV is going to excise from its budgets by cutting in the regions. Ofcom blustered about the evils of the old regime, which tried to micro manage, for example, by stipulating where local news stations were placed. But, frankly, that is the point.</p> <p>We've swung from that (unfortunate) model to the current one in which Ofcom is virtually toothless, it has no powers to stop the cuts and, in addition, has precious little influence. ITV bluntly told the regulator it was making the \u00a340m cuts, regardless.</p> <p>So Ofcom, having actively facilitated the ITV merger back in 2003, can only judge after the fact when the jobs have gone. </p> <p>The reorganisation, with news gathering hubs, enlarged regions - stretching from Penzance to Worcester for example - will also end distinct services for quite diverse heavily-populated areas such as the east and west Midlands. It sounds horribly familiar, like a macro version of the reductions that have so stymied local commercial radio and led to its decline.</p> <p>The current system is far from perfect, but now it is heading to extinction. The cutback is also pretty crude in its pragmatic assumption that peak-time audiences are more important than the daytime ones who will be losing their regional news bulletins. What about older housebound people? What happens next time there are local floods?</p> <p>Ofcom will argue it negotiated as hard as it could. It's just that its leaders seem so bloodless in their willingness to accept the position.</p> <p>We're looking at a regulator that is powerful on analysis and research, presentation and consultation, but weak elsewhere. It is trying to create a consensus as power ebbs away from the (distracted) Labour government that created it.</p> <p>Last week Ed Richards, chief executive of Ofcom, made a speech which ended rather wistfully: \"We face important judgments. Get those judgments wrong and will there be a terminal cataclysm for our society? Of course not. It's just that our lives will be a bit narrower, a bit greyer, a bit duller as a result.\"</p> <p>And there's the rub. He is trying to inch government towards what he hopes will be a decision and, consequently, limited legislation. But Ofcom cannot alter the constitution of Channel 4 so it can receive licence fee funds, nor can it strip the BBC of a share in BBC Worldwide, or devise a levy on blank tapes and downloads to support public service content. </p> <p>For a nation facing inflation, job losses, bank rescues and recession, propping up Channel 4 and trying to build back a system of local and regional news services looks pretty minor.</p> <p>Not a happy place to be.</p>",

  "<p>Gordon Brown's announcement that his commitment to end <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/24/labourconference.children\">child poverty</a> will be enshrined in law made a lot of people sit up in surprise. This is as big and bold a statement as Tony Blair's original commitment to <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/298745.stm\">eradicate child poverty in a generation</a>. It is that rare thing \u2013 government in it for the long term.</p> <p>This past decade has seen many new policies focused on this goal: steps to improve financial support for families, the New Deal programme that helped people access work, improved access to childcare, plus policy aimed at improving housing and neighbourhoods and the educational opportunities of the most disadvantaged. </p> <p>Some policies have been successful, others less so. While the number of children in poverty has risen at <a href=\"http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=1815\">the most recent counts</a>, the long-term trend since 1997 is a downward one.</p> <p>The government's \"Opportunity for All\" indicators, looking at a wider range of measures of disadvantage show a general trend of improvement. However, there are critical areas where there has been stagnation. For example, the number of young people not in education, training or employment has changed little in a decade; in other areas where there has been progress, that progress has been desperately slow.</p> <p>That's why this commitment to put the target into law is so critical. Tackling child poverty and disadvantage is slow and difficult. It sees ups and downs, and wins the government few friends. It has set itself an ambitious goal, which makes it easy to criticise, and we do, but we would rather they failed to meet a lofty vision then settled for a mediocre one in the first place.</p> <p>While the detail of what this law will look like is yet to be determined, we hope it covers certain vital areas. Firstly, some form of reporting process, whereby government are held to account over the steps they have taken to reduce levels of child poverty. </p> <p>Secondly, in the way that local authorities are compelled to publish plans of how they will tackle homelessness or meet their responsibilities to children and young people, so government will be required to produce an ongoing strategy to tackle child poverty. Finally, we hope the government will be forced to \"poverty-proof\" its policy, ensuring that all policies work with this agenda rather than against it. </p> <p>People living in poverty lack a voice in the system. Children living in poverty are doubly silenced. While all political parties talk about child poverty, we know how fickle politics can be and today's story can be forgotten tomorrow. </p> <p>There are two ways we can guarantee that this stays on the agenda. This law will be one. But what has led to this law has been a growing <a href=\"http://www.endchildpoverty.org.uk/\">campaign</a> to end child poverty, a coalition of over 130 charities, trade unions, faith organisations and others, increasingly calling loudly on government and all parties to prioritise this goal. </p> <p>This public pressure is critical and must be built on. On October 4 many thousands will gather in Trafalgar Square to call on Gordon Brown to keep his promise to the UK's children. He's indicated with this announcement that he wants to, now we just need him to deliver.</p>"
